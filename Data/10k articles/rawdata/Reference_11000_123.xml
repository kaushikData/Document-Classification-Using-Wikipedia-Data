The '''Amasa Day House''' is a [[historic house museum]] at 33 Plains Road in the [[Moodus, Connecticut|Moodus]] village of [[East Haddam, Connecticut]].  Built in 1816, it is one of the oldest buildings in the village of Moodus, and a fine example of Federal period architecture.  The house, now owned and operated by [[Connecticut Landmarks]], has displays which showcase how the Industrial Revolution changed the daily life of American families.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

== History == 
The Amasa Day House occupies a prominent location at the northwest end of the Moodus village green, on {{convert|3.5|acre|ha}} of land that are mostly screened from the nearby state highway by trees.  It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior.  Corner pilasters rise to a shallow entablature, with modillion blocks in the eaves.  The side gable ends are pedimented, with half-round windows at the center.  The main entrance is sheltered by a gabled portico; it is flanked by pilasters and topped by a half-oval transom window.  Late 19th-century ells extend to the rear of the original main block.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=72001315}}|title=NRHP Inventory-Nomination: Amasa Day House |author=Susan Babbitt |date=February 29, 1972 |publisher=[[National Park Service]]}} and {{NRHP url|id=72001315|title=''Accompanying four photos, exterior and interior, from 1970 and 1972''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house was constructed in 1816 for farmer Colonel Julius Chapman, his wife Frances, and their four daughters. After his death, Amasa Day purchased the property, but later sold off parcels of land as he focused more on his roles as an insurance agent and banker. The house was subsequently inherited by Day's daughter and son-in-law Katherine and Eugene Chaffee, who worked for the New York Net and Twine Company, one of several twine factories in Moodus. Their son was Dr. Amasa Day Chaffee, a well-known art photographer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historicbuildingsct.com/?p=1498]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Museum ==
The house was donated to [[Connecticut Landmarks]] in 1967, however it is not currently open to the public. An investigation by the attorney general's office into their alleged neglect of the property is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theday.com/article/20180227/NWS05/180229407&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theday.com/article/20180308/NWS05/180309420&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''appartement du roi''''' or '''King's Apartment'''&lt;ref&gt;Saule &amp; Meyer 2000, pp. 17, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; is the suite of rooms in the [[Palace of Versailles]] that served as the living quarters of [[Louis XIV]].  Overlooking the Marble Court (''cour de marbre''), these rooms are situated in the oldest part of the chateau in rooms originally designated for use by the queen in [[Louis XIII|Louis XIII's]] chateau.  Owing largely to the discomfort of the [[Palace of Versailles|''grand appartement du roi'']] and to the construction of the [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Hall of Mirrors]], [[Louis XIV]] began to remodel these rooms for his use shortly after the death of [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]] in 1684.  The ''appartement du roi'' evolved to become the everyday working quarters for [[Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI]].

Initially, the ''appartement du roi'' consisted of a suite of eight rooms that issued from the Queen's Staircase (''escalier de la reine'').  The number was reduced to seven after 1701 and to six in 1755.

==''Vestibule''==
The '''vestibule''' is paneled in marble and lighted by two windows that opened onto the ''cour royale''.  In 1701, in order to provide more light to the staircase, the south wall opposite the windows was opened, thus creating a loggia from the vestibule.  During the latter part of [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] reign, the Queen's staircase and the vestibule served as entrance to the ''appartement du roi'', the ''[[Palace of Versailles|grand appartement de la reine]]'', and the apartment of [[Françoise d'Aubigné, Marquise de Maintenon|Madame de Maintenon]].&lt;ref&gt;Félibien, 58; Piganiol, 118; Verlet, 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Salle des gardes du roi''==
The '''''salle des gardes du roi''''', served to house the ''Garde du corps du roi'' – the King's Body Guard.  The early decor of this room included walls clad in tooled gilt leather and a battle scene by [[Joseph Parrocel]], "The Battle of Leuze, 18 September 1691", hung over the fireplace.&lt;ref&gt;The Battle of Leuze was a famous battle that the French cavalry won during the [[War of the League of Augsburg]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Two large chandeliers emblazoned with the king's monogram complemented the decor.  The utilitarian nature of the room was evidenced by the wooden benches, camp beds, and folding screens used by the guards stationed in the room.  On Mondays, a table, dressed with a gold-fringed velvet rug, would be placed in this room, at which [[Louis XIV]] would personally accept petitions presented to him by his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Félibien, 59; Piganiol, 118; Verlet, 209-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Première antichambre''==
The '''''première antichambre''''' or '''''salon du grand couvert''''' (also known during the reign of [[Louis XIV]] as ''la salle ou le roy soupe''), opened with three windows onto the ''cour de marbre'' (north) and with three windows onto the ''cour de la reine'' (south).&lt;ref&gt;In 1699, in order to accommodate the construction of an apartment for [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] grandson, the [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1682–1712)|Duke of Burgundy]] one of the southern windows was suppress and converted into a door.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Verlet210&gt;Verlet, 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The decoration of the room consisted of battle scenes by [[Joseph Parrocel]] with the "Battle of Arbela" being displayed over the mantelpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Piganiol, 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of the [[Maria Theresa of Spain|queen]] and the [[Princess Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy|dauphine]], the room served for those occasions during which [[Louis XIV]] dined alone in public.  For the ''grand couvert'', a table with a single armchair was dressed before the fireplace.  The wall opposite the fireplace originally contained a tribune for musicians, but this was suppressed in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Verlet210 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An exception to this tradition occurred in between 16 November and 4 December 1700.  Several times during this period, [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] grandson [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe, duc d'Anjou]] after he was proclaimed King of Spain, dined in public with his grandfather.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Félibien, 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of one of the more scandalous events in Versailles history during the Sun King's reign transpired in this room.  In 1691, the fringe from the portieres in the [[Salon de Mars]] and part of the embroidered bed cover from the bed in the [[Salon de Mercure]] were stolen.  Toward the service of dessert, a bundle was thrown through one of the windows facing the ''cour de marbre'' and landed on the king's table.  [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] only comment, "I think that those are my fringes."&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Salon de l'œil de bœuf''==
The '''''salon de l'œil de bœuf''''' or  '''Antechamber of the Œil-de-Bœuf''' was formed in 1701 by combining two adjacent rooms, the ''deuxième antichambre'' and ''chambre du roi''. The ''salon de l'œil de bœuf'' became the main antechamber to the King's Bedroom, which was also created that year (see next section).&lt;ref name=Verlet211 /&gt;

Taking its name from the ''[[œil de bœuf]]'' (oval) window located in the south cove of the ceiling, the ''salon de l'œil de bœuf'' features a gilt-stucco running frieze that decorated the cove of the room's ceiling and features a trellis-work background on which are groups of dancing putti.  It is the decoration of the cove that heralds a transition from the formalistic style that was used in the decoration of the [[Palace of Versailles|grand appartement du roi]] and the [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Hall of Mirrors]] to a more relaxed style that anticipated the ''[[Louis Quinze|style Louis XV]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball (1943), 50–61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis XIV]] spared no expense in decorating this room.  Mirrors, "The Fainting of Ester" and "Judith with the head of Holofernes" by [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]&lt;ref&gt;"Judith with the head of Holofernes" was damaged by fire in 1905 when the Musée de Beaux-Arts in Caen burned.  Source [http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr]&lt;/ref&gt; hung as pendants, and gilt furniture all contributed to making this one of the most sumptuous rooms in the ''appartement du roi''.&lt;ref&gt;Félibien, 339; Verlet, 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The former two rooms, the  ''deuxième antichambre'' and the ''chambre du roi'', were earlier part of the apartment of the queen, but in 1684, after the death of [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Marie-Thérèse d'Autriche]], [[Louis XIV]] attached these rooms to his apartment.&lt;ref name=Verlet211&gt;Verlet, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''deuxième antichambre'' served as waiting room for courtiers waiting to attend the king's ''lever'' in the ''chambre du roi'' and was also known as the ''antichambre des Bassans'' on account of the number of paintings by the northern Italian artist, [[Jacopo Bassano]], that were displayed on the walls.&lt;ref&gt;Piganiol, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the mantelpiece, the famed "''Noli me tangere''s" by [[Lambert Sustris]] was displayed.

==''Chambre de Louis XIV''==
[[File:Cour de Marbre du Château de Versailles October 5, 2011.jpg|thumb|Marble Court facade with the King's Bedchamber opening onto the balcony supported by eight red marble columns]]

The '''''chambre de Louis XIV''''' (or '''King's Bedchamber'''&lt;ref&gt;Saule &amp; Meyer 2000, pp. 17, 49, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;) was constructed in 1701 on the site of the former ''salon du roi'' (or State Drawing Room&lt;ref name=SM4952&gt;Saule &amp; Meyer 2000, pp. 49, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;), which dated from the time of [[Louis XIII]]. This room underwent a number of modifications during the reign of [[Louis XIV]], most notably in 1678 when the three western windows facing the terrace became archways opening into the [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Hall of Mirrors]] (constructed beginning that year), for which the room became a kind of appendage.&lt;ref name=SM4952/&gt; A {{Nowrap|3-storey}} ''[[avant-corps]]'' was added to the exterior of the eastern facade facing the Marble Court, with three bays opening onto a gilt wrought-iron balcony overlooking the courtyard, and the top part of the room corresponding to the attic storey of the ''avant-corps''.&lt;ref name=Verlet213&gt;Verlet 1985, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

When in 1684 [[Louis XIV]] moved into the adjacent room to the south (the ''chambre du roi''), this central room behind the facade of the ''avant-corps'' was designated as the ''salon du roi'' or the ''salon où le roi s'habille'' ("the room in which the king dresses"). For 17 years, it served as venue for the ceremonies that surrounded the life of the king, such as the ''lever'' and the ''coucher''.&lt;ref name=Verlet213/&gt; When the ''chambre de Louis XIV'' was established in 1701, the archways to the Hall of Mirrors were sealed off, and the room became the ideological as well as physical focal point of the palace.&lt;ref name=Verlet213 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The main east-west axes of the palace bisects this room.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baillie, 169–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The king died in this room on 1&amp;nbsp;September 1715. Later, Louis XV and Louis XVI would continue to use it for the ''lever'' and the ''coucher''. On 6 October 1789, Louis XVI, [[Marie Antoinette]], and the [[Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] appeared on the balcony before the mob that forced the royal family to move from Versailles to the [[Tuileries Palace]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Saule &amp; Meyer 2000, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Salon d'Apollon-LE ROI DAVID.jpg|''[[David|King David]] playing the harp'' (ca. 1st quarter of the 17th century) by Domenichino
&lt;/gallery&gt;

As a measure of economy, [[Louis XIV]] retained much of the decor of the ''salon du roi'' in the decoration of the ''chambre de Louis XIV''.  The over-door paintings included ''The Portrait of [[Francisco de Moncada]]'' and a ''Self-portrait'' the two by [[Anthony van Dyck]], ''[[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]]'' by [[Caravaggio]], and ''[[Mary Magdalene]]'' by [[Guido Reni]].   [[Domenico Zampieri|Domenichino's]] ''[[Saint Cecilia]]'' was placed in the cornice setting of the south wall above the fireplace and the artist's ''[[David|King David]] playing the harp'' hung as pendant opposite on the north wall.&lt;ref&gt;Félibien, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The western wall of the room became the wall of the alcove – the area of the room separated by a balustrade in which the bed was located.  The decoration of the alcove, with the ornaments of the agrafe and volutes as well as the trelliswork sculpture, anticipate in many respects anticipates the ''[[Régence|style Régence]]'' that was in vogue between 1715-1723.  Crowning the bed is [[Nicolas Coustou|Nicolas Coustou's]] relief sculpture, ''France Triumphant'', which is complemented by two relief sculptures of ''Fame'' by [[François Lespingola]] located in the pendentives of the arch.&lt;ref name=Verlet214&gt;Verlet, 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The present brocade on the walls of the alcove and for the bed has been rewoven as part of the initiative of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] to restore [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].  The original alcove and bed hangings were restored in 1736; and, in 1785, [[Louis XVI]] ordered the brocade burned from which he obtained over 60 kilograms of gold.  The present hanging, while accurate for the period, are not a reproduction of the brocaded that originally hung in the chambre de [[Louis XIV]].  Owing to lack of archival information when the project was undertaken, it was decided to use the pattern for hangings of the ''tenture d'hiver'' for the queen's bedroom.  Only after the project was underway were the original designs found; as the part of the project had been completed, it was decided to use the queen's ''tenture d'hiver''.&lt;ref name=Verlet214 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1989), 79–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Cabinet du conseil''==
The '''''cabinet de conseil''''' came into being as a council chamber upon the construction of the [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Salon of War]], which occupied site of the [[Salon de Jupiter]], [[Louis XIV|Louis's]] previous council chamber.  Initially called ''cabinet du roi'' from 1684, with the remodeling of the apartment that occurred in 1701, this room received a new decor that featured walls paneled with mirrors.  With the redecoration, the room was rechristened ''cabinet des glaces''.  In spite of the luxury of mirrors, this room was furnished in a utilitarian manner.  In addition to the velvet covered council table, there were three armchairs and 12 folding stools and a daybed, which [[Louis XIV]] used in 1686 as a necessity while suffering from an [[anal fistula]] and the surgery that removed it.&lt;ref&gt;Félibien, 65; Piganiol, 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Verlet217&gt;Verlet, 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the rooms of the ''appartement du roi'', this room perhaps best expressed the personal tastes of [[Louis XIV]].  In addition to the collection of gems, there were works by [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Giovanni Lanfranco]] on the walls as well as [[Harpsichord]] with a painted case.  The personal nature of this room was offset by the fact that this was the room in which [[Louis XIV]] governed France.  Councils were held here, writers who extolled the ''gloire'' of the Sun King were received here, and private audiences most often occurred in this room.&lt;ref name=Verlet217 /&gt;

The last room of the ''appartement du roi'' was the ''cabinet des termes'' – due to the decor that featured 20 Hermes – also called the ''cabinet des perruques'', as this was the room in which [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] wigs were stored.  In addition to the gilt Hermes that decorated the wall, the doors were covered with mirrors.  The room served as a changing room for the king, where he would change his shirt, wig, and hat as many as four times a day.  In the evening, this room would be where [[Louis XIV]] would gather with his children, other members of his family, and selected courtiers.&lt;ref&gt;Félibien, 347; Verlet, 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''cabinet des glaces'' and the ''cabinet des perruques'' disappeared in 1755 when [[Louis XV]] ordered the enlargement and redecoration of the council chamber.  This is the room that is seen today.

In 1748, in order to accommodate the newly constructed ''cabinet du roi'' on the 3rd floor, [[Louis XV]] had the ceiling of the cabinet de glaces lowered by about a meter.  The new dimension to the room necessitated a complete redecoration of the room.  The following year, a new fireplace was installed and the one dating from the time of [[Louis XIV]] and was sent to [[Château de Compiègne|Compiègne]].  In 1755, during the installation of a terrace in the ''cour des cerfs'', [[Louis XV]] decided to enlarge the council room by incorporating the cabinet des perruques.  This larger room was designed by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] with the paneling sculpted by [[Jules-Antoine Rousseau]].  The panels were sculpted with symbols appropriate to governance: trophies of peace and war, attributes of the army, navy, justice, and the insignia of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flammablecabinet.jpg|thumb|right|In English, "inflammable" means "combustible", but can be taken to mean "non-flammable" by people who wrongly treat the "in-" as meaning "not",&lt;ref name=strunk&gt;{{cite book|last=Strunk and White|title=The Elements of Style|year=1979|publisher=MacMillan|location=New York|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; so English safety labels typically use "flammable".]]

An '''auto-antonym''' or '''autantonym''', also called a '''contronym''' or '''contranym''',&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fun-with-words.com/nym_autoantonyms.html|title=Nym Words &gt; Autoantonyms|website=www.fun-with-words.com|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a word with multiple meanings ([[word sense|senses]]) of which one is the reverse of another. For example, the word ''[[wikt:cleave|cleave]]'' can mean "to cut apart" or "to bind together". This phenomenon is called '''enantiosemy''',&lt;ref&gt;Pages 11 and 77 in [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2003, where "enantiosemy" is mentioned along with "auto-opposite".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oup.com/2013/09/simpleton-capsize-kibosh-hobo-bragi-sanction-coleslaw/|title=Etymology gleanings for September 2013|last=Liberman|first=Anatoly|date=25 September 2013|work=Oxford Etymologist|publisher=Oxford University Press|quote=The coexistence of two opposite meanings in a word is called enantiosemy, and the examples are rather numerous.|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''enantionymy''' or '''antilogy''' (''[[wikt:enantio-#Prefix|enantio-]]'' means "opposite"). An enantiosemic term is necessarily [[polysemy|polysemic]].

== Nomenclature ==
The terms "autantonym" and "contronym" were coined by [[Joseph Twadell Shipley]] in 1960 and [[Jack Herring]] in 1962, respectively. An auto-antonym is alternatively called an '''antagonym''', '''Janus word''' (after [[Janus|the Roman god with two faces]]),&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; '''enantiodrome''', '''self-antonym''', '''antilogy''', or '''addad''' (Arabic, singular '''didd''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Addad' : a study of homo-polysemous opposites in Arabic|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/ER/detail/hkul/3849764|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gall|first=Nick|title=Antagonyms|url=http://ironick.typepad.com/ironick/2003/11/antagonyms.html|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic mechanisms ==
Some pairs of contronyms are true [[homograph]]s, i.e., distinct words with different [[etymology]] which happen to have the same form.  For instance ''cleave'' "separate" is from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''clēofan'', while ''cleave'' "adhere" is from Old English ''clifian'', which was pronounced differently. The [[King James Bible]] often uses "let" in the sense of "forbid", a meaning which is now uncommon, and which is derived from the Old English verb ''lettan'' 'hinder, delay, impede, oppress', as opposed to the meaning "allow", which is derived from the Old English verb ''lǣtan'' 'leave, allow, let on lease (etc.)'. Still, the alternate meaning of "let" can be found today in the legal phrase "without let or hindrance" and in ball games such as [[tennis#Play of a single point|tennis]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[table tennis]], and [[racquetball]].

Other contronyms are a form of [[polysemy]], but where a single word acquires different and ultimately opposite definitions. For example, ''sanction''—"permit" or "[[sanctions (law)|penalize]]"; ''bolt'' (originally from [[crossbow]]s)—"leave quickly" or "fix/immobilize"; ''fast''—"moving rapidly" or "unmoving".  Some [[English language|English]] examples result from [[noun]]s being [[Conversion (word formation)|verbed]] in the patterns of "add &lt;noun&gt; to" and "remove &lt;noun&gt; from"; e.g. ''dust'', ''seed'', ''stone''. [[Denotation]]s and [[connotation]]s can drift or branch over centuries. An [[apocrypha]]l story relates how [[Charles II of Great Britain|Charles II]] (or sometimes [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]) described [[St Paul's Cathedral]] (using contemporaneous English) as "awful, pompous, and artificial," with the meaning (rendered in modern English) of "awe-inspiring, majestic, and ingeniously designed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/10/31/st-pauls-cathedral/|title=St Paul’s Cathedral Is Amusing, Awful, and Artificial|last=O’Toole|first=Garson|date=31 October 2012|work=Quote Investigator|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative words such as ''bad'' and ''sick'' sometimes acquire ironic senses referring to traits that are impressive and admired, if not necessarily positive (''that outfit is bad as hell''; ''lyrics full of sick burns'').

Some contronyms result from differences in [[varieties of English]]. For example, to ''[[table (verb)|table]]'' a bill means "to put it up for debate" in [[British English]], while it means "to remove it from debate" in [[Comparison of American and British English#Words and phrases with different meanings|American English]] (where British English would have "shelve"). To ''[[barrack (verb)|barrack]]'' for anyone in [[Australian English]] is to loudly demonstrate your support, while it expresses disapproval and contempt in [[American English]] and [[British English]].

Some words contain simultaneous opposing or competing meanings in the same context, rather than alternative meanings in different contexts; examples include [[blend word]]s such as ''[[coopetition]]'' (meaning a murky blend of cooperation and competition), ''[[frenemy]]'' (meaning a murky blend of friend and enemy), ''[[interdependence]]'', ''[[glocalization]]'' etc. These are not usually classed as contronyms, but they share the theme of containing opposing meanings.

Auto-antonyms exist in many languages, as the following examples show.

In [[Latin language|Latin]], ''[[wikt:sacer#Latin|sacer]]'' has the double meaning "sacred, holy" and "accursed, infamous". Greek [[wikt:δημιουργός#Greek|δημιουργός]] gave Latin its ''[[wikt:demiurgus#Latin|demiurgus]]'', from which English got its ''[[wikt:demiurge#English|demiurge]]'', which can refer either to [[God]] as the [[creator deity|creator]] or to the [[devil]], depending on philosophical context.

In many languages, a word stem associated with a single event may treat the action of that event as unitary, so it can refer to any of the doings or persons on either side of the transaction, that is, to the action of either the subject or the object, or to either the person who does something or the person to whom (or for whom) it is done. Other cues nail down the aspects of subject versus object. Thus there is a simple logic involved, despite that discussions of such words sometimes fixate on a superficial appearance of illogic (that is, "how can one word mean both?!"). Examples: 
* Verbs
** The [[German language|German]] verb ''[[wikt:ausleihen|ausleihen]]'' and the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] verb ''[[wikt:lainata|lainata]]'' can mean either "to lend" or "to borrow", with [[grammatical case|case]], pronouns, and mention of persons making the sense clear. The verb stem conveys that "a lending-and-borrowing event is occurring", and the other cues convey who is lending to whom. This makes sense because anytime lending is occurring, borrowing is simultaneously occurring; one cannot happen without the other.
** The English verb ''[[wikt:appropriate#Verb|appropriate]]'' has several senses with a unitary theme of assets being assigned; it can thus refer either to one giving assets to someone else or one taking assets for oneself. The superficial "contradiction" is that giving and taking are "opposites", but the unity is on the level of "assets being assigned". This is comparable to the German example with the lending-and-borrowing event: similarly, "opposite" sides of a single coin are (figuratively) involved. The coin analogy is useful because it reveals another latent English example of the same cognitive unity: One could ask why "[[coin flipping|flipping a coin]]" in English can "paradoxically" refer to either flipping and getting heads or flipping and getting tails. We don't have separate words, *''heads-ing'' and *''tails-ing''; rather, we have the one word, ''flipping''. Thus ''I flipped him for it'' at the same time that ''he flipped me for it''; it is not [[idiom (language structure)|the idiomatic nature]] of English to say that ''I *heads-ed him for it'' whereas ''he *tails-ed me for it'', although any language could potentially develop that contrasting pair. In the German example, the comparable thought is that ''I lendborrowed to him'' at the same time that ''he lendborrowed from me''—despite that English cannot idiomatically translate it that way because [[accidental gap|English currently lacks such a word as ''*lendborrow'']]. 
** The [[Romanian language|Romanian]] verb ''a închiria'' means "to rent" (as the [[wikt:lessee#English|lessee]] does) as well as "to let" (as the [[wikt:lessor#English|lessor]] does). 
** The [[Swahili language|Swahili]] verb ''kutoa'' means both "to remove" and "to add". 
** In his ''Limited Views: Essays on Ideas and Letters'', [[Qian Zhongshu]] gave some examples of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] auto-antonyms, like "廢" meaning both "to abolish" and "to establish". He named this kind of phenomenon "reverse symbolism"(反象以徵). 
* Adverbs
** {{lang-hi|कल}} and {{lang-ur|کل}} (''kal'' {{IPA-hns|kəl|}}) may mean either "yesterday" or "tomorrow" (disambiguated by the verb in the sentence). 
* Agent nouns
** The [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] [[cognates]], ''[[wikt:ospite|ospite]]'' and ''[[wikt:hôte|hôte]]'', respectively, also can mean "host" or "guest". Both words derive from the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:hospes|hospes]]'', which also carries both meanings.
* Adjectives
** Latin ''[[wikt:altus#Latin|altus]]'' can be translated to English as either "high" (↑) or "deep" (↓), whereas in Latin it has the single meaning "large in the vertical dimension" (↕) in English.
** English ''awesome'' can mean "inducing awe/respect" or "cool, splendid"

Contemporary English has some auto-antonym adjectives that are used for evaluating: ''sick'' can mean "ill" or "extremely good"; ''bad'' can mean "bad" or "excellent"; words like ''cool'' or ''in'' may be evaluate something that is "warm" or "out", respectively ("This new fireplace is cool." or "Outdoor activities are in, now."). We may hear evaluations like "pretty ugly", "ridiculously serious", "insanely rational", "incredibly trustworthy", "impossibly doable", "super sub-par".

Among [[profanity|profanities]], adjective or article decides its meaning, for example:
* "I'm not gonna be a bitch - I'm gonna be the bitch!"
* "Don't be an ass - be bad ass!"
* "The first pizza was shit; the second one, though, was the shit."
* "She thinks she's hot shit but she's not shit."

Seeming auto-antonyms can occur from translation. In [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], for example, ''[[wikt:aloha|aloha]]'' is translated both as “hello” and as “goodbye”, but the essential meaning of the word is "love," whether used as a greeting or farewell.  The [[Italian language|Italian]] greeting ''[[wikt:ciao|ciao]]'' is translated as "hello" or "goodbye" depending on the context; however, the original meaning was “(I'm your) slave."

* "'''Bound'''" can mean "tied into immobility" or "leaping, jumping.”
* "'''Cite'''" can mean "to recognize a good deed or performance" (cite for bravery) or "to require a court appearance" (often not a good thing, such as citing for DUI).
* "'''Chuffed'''" can mean "pleased" or "displeased."

'''Bletchley Park''' is a nineteenth-century mansion and estate near [[Milton Keynes]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], constructed during the years following 1883 for the English financier and politician Sir [[Herbert Samuel Leon]] in the Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles, on the site of older buildings of the same name. It has received latter-day fame as the central site for British (and subsequently, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]]) [[World War II cryptography|codebreakers during World War II]], although at the time of their operation this fact was a closely guarded secret. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the estate housed the British [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the [[Axis Powers]]{{snd}}most importantly the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] and [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] ciphers; among its most notable early personnel the GC&amp;CS team of codebreakers included [[Alan Turing]], [[Gordon Welchman]], [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]].

According to the official historian of British Intelligence, the "[[Ultra]]" intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.&lt;ref name="HinsleyLecture"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinsley|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, culminating in the development of [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid 1970s. After the war, the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] took over the site and used it as a management school, but by 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment, and the Bletchley Park Trust formed in 1991 to save large portions of the site from developers. More recently, Bletchley Park has been open to the public and houses interpretive exhibits and rebuilt huts as they would have appeared during their wartime operations, as well as [[The National Museum of Computing]], established on the site which includes a rebuilt Colossus machine, and receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|title=Bletchley Park Welcomes 2015’S 200,000th Visitor|publisher=Bletchley Park|date=26 August 2015|accessdate=25 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202043901/https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The site appears in the [[Domesday Book]] as part of the [[Water Eaton, Milton Keynes|Manor of Eaton]]. [[Browne Willis]] built a mansion there in 1711, but after Thomas Harrison purchased the property in 1793 this was pulled down. It was first known as Bletchley Park after its purchase by [[Samuel Lipscomb Seckham]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrison|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate of {{convert|581|acres|ha}} was bought in 1883 by Sir [[Herbert Samuel Leon]], who expanded the then-existing farmhouse&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Edward |first=Legg |title=Early History of Bletchley Park 1235{{ndash}}1937|work=Bletchley Park Trust Historic Guides|number=1|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; into what architect [[Landis Gores]] called a "maudlin and monstrous pile"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrison|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKay|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; combining [[Victorian Gothic]], [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]], and [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Baroque]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.anglotopia.net/british-history/great-british-houses-bletchley-park-house-saved-britain-world-war-ii/|publisher=Great British Houses|title=Bletchley Park – The House That Helped Save Britain in World War II – Where Enigma Was Decoded|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the mansion and much of the site was bought by a builder planning a housing estate, but in May 1938 Admiral Sir [[Hugh Sinclair]], head of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS or [[MI6]]), bought the mansion and {{convert|58|acre|ha}} of land for £6,000, using his own money after the Government said they did not have the budget to do so, for use by GC&amp;CS and SIS in the event of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrison|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key advantage seen by Sinclair and his colleagues (inspecting the site under the cover of "Captain Ridley's shooting party")&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKay|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was Bletchley's geographical centrality. It was almost immediately adjacent to [[Bletchley railway station]], where the "[[Varsity Line]]" between [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]]{{snd}}whose universities were expected to supply many of the code-breakers{{snd}}met the main [[West Coast Main Line|West Coast railway line]] connecting London, [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]. [[Watling Street]], the main road linking London to the north-west (subsequently the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]) was close by, and high-volume communication links were available at the telegraph and telephone repeater station in nearby [[Fenny Stratford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C2135171|title=Fenny Stratford Telephone Repeater Station. Erection. A. Cole Ltd.|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bletchley Park was known as "B.P." to those who worked there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Briggs|2011|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Station X" (X = Roman numeral ten), "London Signals Intelligence Centre", and "[[Government Communications Headquarters]]" were all cover names used during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aldrich|2010|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The formal posting of the many "Wrens"{{snd}}members of the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]]{{snd}}working there, was to [[RAF Eastcote|HMS Pembroke V]]. Royal Air Force names of Bletchley Park and its outstations included [[RAF Eastcote]], RAF Lime Grove and RAF Church Green.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shearer | first = Caroline | title = My years at Bletchley Park – Station X | year = 2014 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/60/a2377460.shtml | access-date = 27 January 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170226011212/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/60/a2377460.shtml | archive-date = 26 February 2017 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The postal address that staff had to use was "Room 47, Foreign Office".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Good |first=Jack | author-link = I.J. Good |title=Enigma and Fish |page=154}} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|pp=149–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the Government Code &amp; Cypher School became the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) moving to [[Eastcote]] in 1946 and to [[Cheltenham]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= GCHQ |author-link= Government Communications Headquarters |title= Bletchley Park - post-war |year= 2016 |url= https://www.gchq.gov.uk/features/bletchley-park-post-war }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was used by various government agencies, including the [[General Post Office|GPO]] and the [[Civil Aviation Authority]]. One large building, block F was demolished in 1987 by which time the site was being run down with tenants leaving. In 1990 the site was at risk of being sold for housing development. However, [[Milton Keynes Council]] made it into a conservation area. Bletchley Park Trust was set up in 1991 by a group of people who recognised the site's importance.{{sfn|Enever|1999}} The initial trustees included Roger Bristow, Ted Enever, [[Peter Wescombe]], Dr Peter Jarvis of the Bletchley Archaeological &amp; Historical Society, and [[Tony Sale]] who in 1994 became the first director of the Bletchley Park Museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Anon |title= Peter Wescombe - obituary |publisher= Daily Telegraph |year= 2014 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11299648/Peter-Wescombe-obituary.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commander [[Alastair Denniston]] was operational head of GC&amp;CS from 1919 to 1942, beginning with its formation from the [[Admiralty]]'s [[Room 40]] (NID25) and the [[War Office]]'s [[MI1]]b.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key GC&amp;CS [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] who moved from London to Bletchley Park included [[John Tiltman]], [[Dilly Knox|Dillwyn "Dilly" Knox]], [[Josh Cooper (cryptographer)|Josh Cooper]], and [[Nigel de Grey]]. These people had a variety of backgrounds{{snd}}linguists and chess champions were common, and in Knox's case [[papyrology]]. The British War Office recruited top solvers of [[cryptic crossword]] puzzles, as these individuals had strong [[lateral thinking]] skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11151478/Could-you-have-been-a-codebreaker-at-Bletchley-Park.html|title=Could you have been a codebreaker at Bletchley Park?|date=10 October 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=25 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324105712/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11151478/Could-you-have-been-a-codebreaker-at-Bletchley-Park.html|archive-date=24 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[British and French declaration of war on Germany|the day Britain declared war on Germany]], Denniston wrote to the [[Foreign Office]] about recruiting "men of the professor type".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal networking drove early recruitments, particularly of men from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Trustworthy women were similarly recruited for administrative and clerical jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=13{{ndash}}23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one 1941 recruiting stratagem, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was asked to organise a crossword competition, after which promising contestants were discreetly approached about "a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=McKay |first=Sinclair |title=Telegraph crossword: Cracking hobby won the day – The boffins of Bletchley cut their teeth on the Telegraph crossword |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=26 August 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/wellbeing/7966268/Telegraph-crossword-Cracking-hobby-won-the-day.html |access-date=3 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227164948/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/wellbeing/7966268/Telegraph-crossword-Cracking-hobby-won-the-day.html |archive-date=27 December 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1945, at the peak of codebreaking efforts, some 10,000 personnel were working at Bletchley and its outstations.&lt;ref name="Women Codebreakers"&gt;{{cite web |author=tanya king says: |url=http://www.bletchleyparkresearch.co.uk/research-notes/women-codebreakers/ |title=Women Codebreakers |publisher=Bletchley Park Research |date= |accessdate=12 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126200024/http://www.bletchleyparkresearch.co.uk/research-notes/women-codebreakers/ |archive-date=26 November 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; About three-quarters of these &lt;ref name="Women Codebreakers"/&gt; were women. Many of the women came from middle-class backgrounds&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; and held degrees in the areas of mathematics, physics and engineering; they were given entry into [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] programs due to the lack of men, who had been sent to war.

Many of the women had backgrounds in languages, particularly French and German. [[Rozanne Colchester]] was a translator who worked at Bletchley from April 1942 until January 1945, mainly for the Italian air forces Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rollofhonour.bletchleypark.org.uk/search/record-detail/6221/ |title=Record Detail - Bletchley Park - Roll of Honour |website=Rollofhonour.bletchleypark.org.uk |date= |accessdate=12 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122115442/http://rollofhonour.bletchleypark.org.uk/search/record-detail/6221/ |archive-date=22 January 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of the 'Bletchleyettes', she came from the higher middle class, her father, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Charles Medhurst, being an air attaché in Rome. Before joining Bletchley, Colchester was moving in high circles: “she had met Hitler and been flirted with by Mussolini at an embassy party”, writes Sarah Rainey. She joined the Park because she found it thrilling to fight for her country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11308744/The-extraordinary-female-codebreakers-of-Bletchley-Park.html|title=The Telegraph, The extraordinary female codebreakers of Bletchley Park|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105114712/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11308744/The-extraordinary-female-codebreakers-of-Bletchley-Park.html|archive-date=5 January 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cicely Mayhew]] was recruited straight from university, having graduated from [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]] in 1944 with a First in French and German, after only two years. She worked in Hut 8, translating decoded German Navy signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lady-mayhew-chgtmfh2w |title=Lady Mayhew &amp;#124; Register &amp;#124; The Times &amp; The Sunday Times |website=Thetimes.co.uk |date=21 July 2016 |accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Briggs, a German scholar, worked within the Naval Section and was known as one of the best cryptographers;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1MC2d2LPAcC|title=Codebreakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park|last=Hinsley|first=Francis Harry|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780192801326|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; she married [[Oliver Churchill]] of the SOE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bletchleyparkresearch.co.uk/research-notes/women-codebreakers/|title=Women Codebreakers|date=3 October 2013|website=Bletchley Park Research|language=en-US|access-date=16 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630041453/http://www.bletchleyparkresearch.co.uk/research-notes/women-codebreakers/|archive-date=30 June 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secrecy==
Properly used, the German Enigma and [[Lorenz cipher]]s should have been virtually unbreakable, but flaws in German cryptographic procedures, and poor discipline among the personnel carrying them out, created vulnerabilities that made Bletchley's attacks just barely feasible. These vulnerabilities, however, could have been remedied by relatively simple improvements in enemy procedures,&lt;ref name="Milner-Barry1993P92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Milner-Barry|1993|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such changes would certainly have been implemented had Germany had any hint of Bletchley's success. Thus the intelligence Bletchley produced was considered wartime Britain's "[[Ultra]] secret"{{snd}}higher even than the normally highest classification {{nowrap|''Most&amp;nbsp;Secret''{{thinsp}}{{snd}}}}and security was paramount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All staff signed the [[Official Secrets Act 1939|Official Secrets Act (1939)]] and a 1942 security warning emphasised the importance of discretion even within Bletchley itself: "Do not talk at meals. Do not talk in the transport. Do not talk travelling. Do not talk in the billet. Do not talk by your own fireside. Be careful even in your Hut{{nbsp}}..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=128{{ndash}}29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there were security leaks. [[Jock Colville]], the Assistant Private Secretary to [[Winston Churchill]], recorded in his diary on 31 July 1941, that the newspaper proprietor [[Lord Camrose]] had discovered Ultra and that security leaks "increase in number and seriousness".{{sfn|Colville|1985|p=422}} Without doubt, the most serious of these was that Bletchley Park had been infiltrated by [[John Cairncross]], the notorious Soviet mole and member of the [[Cambridge Spy Ring]], who leaked Ultra material to Moscow.{{sfn|Smith|2015|pp=81-82}}

== Early work ==

The first personnel of the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939. The Naval, Military, and Air Sections were on the ground floor of the mansion, together with a telephone exchange, teleprinter room, kitchen, and dining room; the top floor was allocated to [[MI6]]. Construction of the wooden huts began in late 1939, and Elmers School, a neighbouring boys' boarding school in a Victorian Gothic redbrick building by a church, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|pp=2{{ndash}}3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[United States]] joined World War II, a number of American [[cryptographer]]s were posted to [[Hut 3]], and from May 1943 onwards there was close co-operation between British and American intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1993|pp=71, 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[1943 BRUSA Agreement]].) In contrast, the [[Soviet Union]] was never officially told of Bletchley Park and its activities{{snd}} a reflection of Churchill's distrust of the Soviets even during the US-UK-USSR alliance imposed by the Nazi threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8ZJxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA571&amp;lpg=PA571&amp;dq=Churchill+distrust+Soviet+Union+bletchley&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EKm6ed98b_&amp;sig=9P_qMmPYn6JatcEkvRTPkipN_Bw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj438T8iYPeAhUBLMAKHV1SAqwQ6AEwEHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Churchill%20distrust%20Soviet%20Union%20bletchley&amp;f=false|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of World War II|page=571|first= Cathal J. |last=Nolan|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2010|volume=1|isbn=978-0313330506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only direct enemy damage to the site was done 20{{ndash}}21 November 1940 by three bombs probably intended for [[Bletchley railway station]]; Hut{{nbsp}}4, shifted two feet off its foundation, was winched back into place as
work inside continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bletchley Park National Codes Centre |title=The Cafe in Hut 4 |url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content//index.rhtm |accessdate=3 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119043409/http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content//index.rhtm |archive-date=19 January 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligence reporting==
[[File:Ultra Hut3 Graph.png|thumbnail|upright=1.5| Average daily number of Signals to Commands Abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1999|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Non-naval Enigma messages were deciphered in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;6]], followed by translation, indexing and cross-referencing, in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;3]]. Only then was it sent out to the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), the intelligence chiefs in the relevant ministries, and later on to high-level commanders in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|pp=70–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval Enigma deciphering was in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;8]], with translation in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;4]].
Verbatim translations were sent only to the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] (NID) of the Admiralty's Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC), supplemented by information from indexes as to the meaning of technical terms and cross-references from a knowledge store of German naval technology.&lt;ref name="Calvocoressi 2001 29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hut 4 also decoded a manual system known as the dockyard cipher, which sometimes carried messages that were also sent on an Enigma network. Feeding these back to Hut{{nbsp}}8 provided excellent "cribs" for [[Known-plaintext attack]]s on the daily naval Enigma key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Erskine|2011|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Listening stations==
Initially, a [[radio|wireless]] room was established at Bletchley Park.
It was set up in the mansion's water tower under the code name "Station&amp;nbsp;X",&lt;ref name="WatsonP307"&gt;{{Harvnb|Watson|1993|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term now sometimes applied to the codebreaking efforts at Bletchley as a whole. The "X" is the [[Roman numeral]] "ten", this being the Secret Intelligence Service's tenth such station. Due to the long radio aerials stretching from the wireless room, the radio station was moved from Bletchley Park to nearby [[Whaddon Hall]] to avoid drawing attention to the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Butters|2007|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pidgeon|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, other listening stations{{snd}}the [[Y-stations]], such as the ones at [[Chicksands]] in Bedfordshire, [[Beaumanor Hall]], Leicestershire (where the headquarters of the War Office "Y" Group was located) and [[Beeston Hill Y Station]] in Norfolk{{snd}}gathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley. Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle [[despatch rider]]s or (later) by teleprinter.&lt;ref name=teleprinters&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1440534|title=Teleprinter Building, Bletchley Park|publisher=Pastscape|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional buildings==
The wartime needs required the building of additional accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Watson |first=Bob |title=Appendix: How the Bletchley Park buildings took shape |pages=306–310}} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|pp=149–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often a hut's number became so strongly associated with the work performed inside that even when the work was moved to another building it was still referred to by the original "Hut" designation.&lt;ref&gt;Some of this information has been derived from [http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/history/RollofHonour.rhtm The Bletchley Park Trust's Roll of Honour] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518133112/http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/history/RollofHonour.rhtm |date=18 May 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Butters|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most German messages decrypted at Bletchley were produced by one or another version of the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] cipher machine, but an important minority were produced by the even more complicated twelve-rotor [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://totalmk.co.uk/whats-on/virtual-lorenz-revealed-in-tribute-to-wartime-codebreakers-at-bletchley-park|title=Virtual Lorenz revealed in tribute to wartime codebreakers at Bletchley Park|publisher=Total MK|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luftwaffe]] messages were the first to be read in quantity. The German navy had much tighter procedures, and the capture of code books was needed before they could be broken. When, in February 1942, the German navy introduced the four-rotor Enigma for communications with its Atlantic U-boats, this traffic became unreadable for a period of ten months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2006|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain produced modified bombes, but it was the success of the [[US Navy Bombe|US Navy bombe]] that was the main source of reading messages from this version of Enigma for the rest of the war. Messages were sent to and fro across the Atlantic by enciphered teleprinter links.&lt;ref name=teleprinters/&gt;

[[File:Colossus.jpg|thumbnail|right|A Mark 2 Colossus computer. The ten Colossi were the world's first (semi-) programmable electronic computers, the first having been built in 1943]]

The [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher|Lorenz messages]] were codenamed ''Tunny'' at Bletchley Park. They were only sent in quantity from mid-1942. The Tunny networks were used for high-level messages between German High Command and field commanders. With the help of German operator errors, the cryptanalysts in the [[Testery]] (named after [[Ralph Tester]], its head) worked out the logical structure of the machine despite not knowing its physical form. They devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, which culminated in [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. This was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] and his team at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]]. The prototype first worked in December 1943, was delivered to Bletchley Park in January and first worked operationally on 5 February 1944. Enhancements were developed for the Mark 2 Colossus, the first of which was working at Bletchley Park on the morning of 1 June in time for [[Normandy landings|D-day]]. Flowers then produced one Colossus a month for the rest of the war, making a total of ten with an eleventh part-built. The machines were operated mainly by Wrens in a section named the [[Newmanry]] after its head [[Max Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bletchley's work was essential to defeating the [[U-boat]]s in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], and to the British naval victories in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] and the [[Battle of North Cape]]. In 1941, Ultra exerted a powerful effect on the [[North African Campaign|North African desert campaign]] against German forces under General [[Erwin Rommel]]. General Sir [[Claude Auchinleck]] wrote that were it not for Ultra, "Rommel would have certainly got through to Cairo". While not changing the events,&lt;!--maybe instead we should list more situations in which events WERE changed--&gt; "[[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]]" decrypts featured prominently in the story of [[Operation Salaam|Operation SALAM]], [[László Almásy]]'s mission across [[Western Desert (Egypt)|the desert]] behind Allied lines in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Kuno, Michael Rolke and András Zboray, [http://fjexpeditions.com/resources/salam/operation_salam.htm Operation SALAM] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516121757/http://fjexpeditions.com/resources/salam/operation_salam.htm |date=16 May 2013 }} - László Almásy’s most daring Mission in the Desert War, Belleville, München, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Normandy landings]] on D-Day in June 1944, the Allies knew the locations of all but two of Germany's fifty-eight Western-front divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian signals===
{{see also|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma}}
Italian signals had been of interest since Italy's attack on Abyssinia in 1935.
During the [[Spanish Civil War]] the [[Royal Italian Navy|Italian Navy]] used the K model of the commercial Enigma without a plugboard; this was solved by Knox in 1937.
When Italy entered the war in 1940 an improved version of the machine was used, though little traffic was sent by it and there were "wholesale changes" in Italian codes and cyphers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lwKuAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT87&amp;dq=Bletchley+%22Italian+Navy%22+%22K+model%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-uPS7lYPeAhXMC8AKHUeqD-wQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bletchley%20%22Italian%20Navy%22%20%22K%20model%22&amp;f=false|title=The Bletchley Park Codebreakers|first= Michael|last= Smith|publisher=Biteback|year=2011|isbn=978-1849540780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knox was given a new section for work on Enigma variations, which he staffed with women ("Dilly's girls"), who included [[Margaret Rock]], Jean Perrin, Clare Harding, Rachel Ronald, Elisabeth Granger; and [[Mavis Batey|Mavis Lever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grey|2012|pp=1323–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mavis Lever solved the signals revealing the Italian Navy's operational plans before the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in 1941, leading to a British victory.&lt;ref name=batey&gt;{{Citation |last=Batey |first=Mavis | author-link = Mavis Batey |title=Breaking Italian Naval Enigma |year=2011 |page=81}} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011|pp=79–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most Bletchley staff did not know the results of their work, Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Cunningham]] visited Bletchley in person a few weeks later to congratulate them.&lt;ref name=batey/&gt;

On entering World War II in June 1940, the [[Italy|Italians]] were using book codes for most of their military messages. The exception was the [[Italian Navy]], which after the Battle of Cape Matapan started using the [[C-38 (cipher machine)|C-38]] version of the [[Boris Hagelin]] [[Rotor machine|rotor-based]] [[cipher machine]], particularly to route their navy and merchant marine convoys to the conflict in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hinsley |first=Sir Harry | author-link = Harry Hinsley |title=The Influence of ULTRA in the Second World War |origyear=1993 |year=1996 |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/Historical/hinsley.html |accessdate=23 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706194507/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/Historical/hinsley.html |archivedate=6 July 2012}} Transcript of a lecture given on Tuesday 19 October 1993 at Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt;
As a consequence, [[James Ramsay Montagu Butler|JRM Butler]] recruited his former student [[Bernard Willson]] to join a team with two others in Hut{{nbsp}}4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Dakin |first=Alec Naylor |year=1993 |title=The Z Watch in Hut 4, Part I }} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|pp=50{{ndash}}56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wilkinson |first=Patrick |year=1993 |title=Italian naval ciphers}} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|pp=61–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1941, Willson became the first of the team to decode the Hagelin system, thus enabling military commanders to direct the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] to sink enemy ships carrying supplies from Europe to Rommel's [[Afrika Korps]]. This led to increased shipping losses and, from reading the intercepted traffic, the team learnt that between May and September 1941 the stock of fuel for the [[Luftwaffe]] in North Africa reduced by 90 percent.&lt;ref name=BPJuly41&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/archive/index/july1941.rhtm |title=July 1941 |publisher=Bletchley Park |accessdate=23 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117213633/http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/archive/index/july1941.rhtm |archive-date=17 January 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After an intensive language course, in March 1944 Willson switched to Japanese language-based codes.&lt;ref name=Express&gt;{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Middle East Intelligence Centre (MEIC) was set up in Cairo in 1939. When Italy entered the war in June 1940, delays in forwarding intercepts to Bletchley via congested radio links resulted in cryptanalysts being sent to Cairo. A Combined Bureau Middle East (CBME) was set up in November, though the Middle East authorities made "increasingly bitter complaints" that [[GC&amp;CS]] was giving too little priority to work on Italian cyphers. However, the principle of concentrating high-grade cryptanalysis at Bletchley was maintained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Hinsley|Hinsley, Harry]] ''British Intelligence in the Second World War, Volume One: Its Influence on Strategy and Operations'' (1979, Her Majesties Stationery Office, London) pp. 191{{ndash}}221, 570{{ndash}}72 {{ISBN|0 11 630933 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Chadwick]] started cryptanalysis work in 1942 on Italian signals at the naval base 'HMS Nile' in Alexandria. Later, he was with GC&amp;CS; in the Heliopolis Museum, Cairo and then in the Villa Laurens, Alexandria.&lt;ref name="CAMBRIDGE"&gt;[http://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/faculty/research_groups_and_societies/mycenaean_epigraphy/decipherment/life_of_chadwick/ "Life of John Chadwick : 1920 - 1998 : Classical Philologist, Lexicographer and Co-decipherer of Linear B"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017230923/http://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/faculty/research_groups_and_societies/mycenaean_epigraphy/decipherment/life_of_chadwick/ |date=2010-10-17 }}, Faculty of Classics, Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet signals===
Soviet signals had been studied since the 1920s. In 1939{{ndash}}40, [[John Tiltman]] (who had worked on Russian Army traffic from 1930) set up two Russian sections at Wavendon (a country house near Bletchley) and at [[Sarafand al-Amar|Sarafand]] in Palestine. Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&amp;CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Michael | author-link = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) |title=The Government Code and Cypher School and the First Cold War |year=2011 |pages=13–34}} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese signals===
An outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB). The FECB naval staff moved in 1940 to Singapore, then [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], then [[Kilindini Harbour|Kilindini]], [[Mombasa]], Kenya. They succeeded in deciphering Japanese codes with a mixture of skill and good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Michael |title=Mombasa was base for high-level UK espionage operation |url=http://www.coastweek.com/codes.htm |work=coastweek.com |publisher=Coastweek |accessdate=20 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515123737/http://www.coastweek.com/codes.htm |archive-date=15 May 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army and Air Force staff went from Singapore to the [[Wireless Experimental Centre]] at [[Delhi]], India.&lt;ref name=smith54&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=54-55, 175-180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1942, a six-month crash course in Japanese, for 20 undergraduates from Oxford and Cambridge, was started by the Inter-Services Special Intelligence School in Bedford, in a building across from the main Post Office. This course was repeated every six months until war's end. Most of those completing these courses worked on decoding Japanese naval messages in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;7]], under [[John Tiltman]].&lt;ref name=smith54/&gt;

By mid-1945, well over 100 personnel were involved with this operation, which co-operated closely with the FECB and the US Signal intelligence Service at [[Arlington Hall]], Virginia. In 1999, Michael Smith wrote that: "Only now are the British codebreakers (like [[John Tiltman]], [[Hugh Foss]], and [[Eric Nave]]) beginning to receive the recognition they deserve for breaking Japanese codes and cyphers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2001|pp=127{{ndash}}51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post war==

===Continued secrecy===
After the War, the secrecy imposed on Bletchley staff remained in force, so that most relatives never knew more than that a child, spouse, or parent had done some kind of secret war work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=129{{ndash}}35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill referred to the Bletchley staff as "the geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewin|2001|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, occasional mentions of the work performed at Bletchley Park slipped the censor's net and appeared in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thirsk|2008|pp=61–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of [[F. W. Winterbotham|F.{{nbsp}}W. Winterbotham's]] ''The Ultra Secret'' (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Winterbotham |first=F. W. | author-link = F.W.

===Site===
After the war, the site passed through a succession of hands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art9678.asp|title=Solo Travel Summer Home Preparation|website=Bellaonline.com|accessdate=25 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311205544/http://bellaonline.com/articles/art9678.asp|archive-date=11 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saw a number of uses, including as a teacher-training college and local [[General Post Office|GPO]] headquarters. By 1991, the site was nearly empty and the buildings were at risk of demolition for redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bletchleypark.org.uk/our-story/why-it-matters/preserving-bletchley-park|title=Preserving Bletchley Park|publisher=Bletchley Park|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1992, the [[Milton Keynes Borough Council]] declared most of the Park a conservation area, and the Bletchley Park Trust was formed to maintain the site as a museum. The site opened to visitors in 1993, and was formally inaugurated by HRH The Duke of Kent as Chief Patron in July 1994. In 1999 the land owners, the [[Office of Government Commerce|Property Advisors to the Civil Estate]] and [[BT Group|BT]], granted a lease the Trust giving the Trust control over most of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/recent.rhtm|title=Bletchley Park History|author=Bletchley Park Trust.|website=Bletchleypark.org.uk|accessdate=25 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102204518/http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/recent.rhtm|archive-date=2 January 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ColossusRebuild 11.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anthony Sale|Tony Sale]] supervising the breaking of an enciphered message with the completed [[Colossus computer]] rebuild in 2006]]

The National Museum of Computing is housed in Block H, which is rented from the Bletchley Park Trust. Its Colossus and Tunny galleries tell an important part of allied breaking of German codes during World War II. There is a working reconstruction of a [[Colossus computer]] that was used on the high-level [[Lorenz cipher]], codenamed ''Tunny'' by the British.&lt;ref name="codesandciphers.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/lorenz/rebuild.htm|title=Colossus Rebuild - Tony Sale|website=Codesandciphers.org.uk|accessdate=25 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322000440/http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/lorenz/rebuild.htm|archive-date=22 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/06/29/geeks_guide_tnmoc/|title=Rise of the machines, south of Milton Keynes|publisher=The Register|accessdate=25 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126100029/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/06/29/geeks_guide_tnmoc/|archive-date=26 January 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum, which opened in 2007, is an independent voluntary organisation that is governed by its own board of trustees. Its aim is "To collect and restore computer systems particularly those developed in Britain and to enable people to explore that collection for inspiration, learning and enjoyment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Mission Statement of The National Museum of Computing |publisher=CodesandCiphers Heritage Trust |url=http://www.tnmoc.org/about-us |accessdate=8 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214103752/http://www.tnmoc.org/about-us |archive-date=14 February 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its many exhibits, the museum displays the story of computing through the mainframes of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of personal computing in the 1980s.

The Colossus and Tunny galleries are open daily. The rest of the museum is open to the public every Thursday, Saturday and Sunday afternoons and most bank holidays, and by appointment for groups only, at other times. There are guided tours on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons and Thursday morning. There is a modest admission charge to the museum to help cover overheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnmoc.org/about-us/contact-national-museum-computing?gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4beBRDNARIsAGZaZ5daUCjUO-GVHwheSxIqCb3iur8O5XDK94jvr9tPs1gtgqm5q3ShDX8aAiaEEALw_wcB|title=About us|publisher=National Museum of Computing|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Agatha Christie novel ''[[N or M?]]'', published in 1941, was about codebreaking during the Second World War and featured a character called Major Bletchley. Although the book had nothing to do with Bletchley Park, having been written when the purpose of the site was still secret, Christie herself was almost arrested under the belief that the character name and subject matter were a hint to Germany that something was happening there. It turned out to be a coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Agatha Christie was investigated by MI5 over Bletchley Park mystery|author=Richard Norton-Taylor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/04/agatha-christie-mi5-bletchley|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=4 February 2013|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Carstairs began working for his father-in-law (Charles Field Haseltine) at Haseltine Gallery, at 1125 &amp; 1127 Chestnut Street in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, 1997, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; After working for Haseltine for eight years, Carstairs began working for [[Knoedler|Knoedler &amp; Co.]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, 1997, p.113&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, Carstairs was sent to Pittsburgh to lead the newly opened Knoedler &amp; Co. branch at 432 Wood Street. Here, he began promoting [[Old Master]] paintings to Pittsburgh's industrial rich.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine, 2006, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; From Pittsburgh, Carstairs moved to [[England]] in 1908 to lead Knoedler's [[London]] branch, which had opened in 1902 at 15 [[Bond Street|Old Bond Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 2006, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saltzman, 2008, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Carstairs reoriented the London gallery's focus from contemporary Parisian artists to Old Master paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Saltzman, 2008, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of [[World War I]] interrupted international trade, but also lead to the movement of many Old Master Art works to the United States. This movement of art works was advantageous, both to American dealers such as Knoedler &amp; Co. and collectors such as [[Henry Clay Frick]]. In 1915, Carstairs stated, "England acquired her great Masterpieces during the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars and now America's opportunity has come." &lt;ref&gt;Saltzman, 2008, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, upon Roland Knoedler's retirement, Charles Carstairs, his son Carroll Carstairs, Charles Henschel (Knoedler's nephew), and Carmen Mesmore took up the management of the [[Knoedler| Knoedler &amp; Co.]] From this point, Charles Carstairs acted as chairman of the board at Knoedler &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, 2000, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Henry Clay Frick==
Carstairs acted as Frick's preferred dealer for some time. The large quantity of Old Master Paintings in [[Frick Collection|Frick's collection]] demonstrates Carstairs' influence on Frick's taste. In 1908, Frick wrote in a letter to Carstairs "there is no-one whose judgment of the beautiful I have more confidence in than yours".&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 2006, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In his relocation from Pittsburgh to New York, Frick was thrown into an increasingly competitive environment of [[conspicuous consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;Saltzman, 2008, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Carstairs turned Frick's attention to increasingly expensive Old Masters paintings as well as artworks that carried social prestige, such as aristocratic  portraits, and encouraged Frick to invest in such art as a means of bolstering his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Saltzman, 2008, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saltzman, 2008, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

The two remained close friends over Frick's lifetime. Not only did Carstairs aid in the construction of Frick's [[Henry Clay Frick House|East 70th Street mansion]] but he also acted as an honorary [[pallbearer]] at Frick's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 2006, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth Stebbins Carstairs, 1908, by Francois Flameng.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Stebbins Carstairs, 1908, by Francois Flameng]]
==Personal life==
In 1886, Carstairs married Esther Holmes Haseltine (29 April 1864 - 15 January 1907). Carstairs and Haseltine had four children, Charles Haseltine Carstairs (August 1886 – 26 October 1919), [[Carroll Carstairs|Carroll Chevalier Carstairs]] (20 March 1888 – 2 October 1948), James Stewart Carstairs (2 June 1890 – 20 September 1932) and Elizabeth “Lily” Haseltine Carstairs (2 November 1892 – April 1977).&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, 1911, p. 874.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 Carstairs met the American actress, Elizabeth Stebbins (19 October 1875 - 7 May 1949), while crossing the Atlantic, he on a buying trip for Knoedler Gallery, and she to perform on the London stage. A romance ensued, and Carstairs divorced his wife, Esther, later that year.  He married Elizabeth Stebbins in 1905 and settled in the fashionable Mayfair district of London.&lt;ref&gt;"A Dealer Collects: Reconstructing Charles Stewart Carstairs's Private Art Collection," Journal of the History of Collections, Oxford University Press, April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, shortly after being announced chairman of the board for Knoedler &amp; Co., Charles Carstairs died of a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;Saltzman, 2008, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chris Bertish''' is a South-African-born [[surfing|surfer]], [[standup paddleboarding|stand-up paddleboarder]], adventurer, and [[motivational speaker]].  He won the Mavericks Big Wave Surf contest in 2009. In March 2017 he completed the first solo, unsupported [[Standup paddleboarding|stand-up paddle board]] (SUP) crossing of  the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  He did it while supporting charitable organizations.  He has also set other SUP world records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sport24.co.za/OtherSport/South-Africa/chris-bertish-completes-first-ever-solo-unsupported-transatlantic-sup-crossing-20170310 |date=March 10, 2017 |publisher=[[News24|Sports24]]  |title=South Africa: Chris Bertis completes first ever solo unsupported transatlantic SUP crossing |quote=Bertish personally committed to funding one operation for a child in Africa through Operation Smile for every world record he achieved on this epic Transatlantic journey.

==Background==
In February 2010, Bertish competed at the [[Mavericks, California|2009/10 Mavericks Surf Contest]] near [[Half Moon Bay, California|Half Moon Bay]], Northern California, winning the [[U.S. Dollars|$]]50,000 big-wave surf competition.&lt;ref name="NYT03"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/sports/14wave.html |title=13 Hurt When Waves Wash Away Spectators at Contest |date=13 February 2010 |access-date=13 March 2017 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sport2401"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sport24.co.za/OtherSport/Bertish-wins-at-Mavericks-20100215 |title=Bertish wins at Mavericks |date=15 February 2010 |work=Sports24 |access-date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watched by 50,000 spectators, the contestants experienced waves in excess of {{convert|40|ft|sp=us|abbr=on|0}}. Bertish arrived at the competition without his equipment and had to borrow a board to compete.&lt;ref name=Sport2401/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sport2402"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sport24.co.za/OtherSport/South-Africa/bertish-recalls-big-wave-madness-20160504 |title=Bertish recalls big wave madness |date=4 May 2016 |publisher=Sports24 |access-date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a failed attempt at crossing the Atlantic on a stand-up paddleboard occurred.  The boat was piloted by Nicholas Jarossay, a French citizen who was rescued a week into his trip.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;{{efn-ua| One of the [[rudder]] lines failed, skewing the boat sideways to oncoming wind and waves.  A large swell flipped the board, which [[Turtling (sailing)|turtled]], and could not be righted (or even towed by the coastal rescuers).  A [[Jackline|Safety line]] held him fast to the craft, and [[hypothermia]] soon became a problem.  Fortunately, he was rescued.  Lack of a self-righting design was a major defect in the attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supracer.com/stand-up-paddle-board-atlantic-ocean-crossing-nicolas-jarossay/ |title=The Incredible Story of Nicolas Jarossay’s Abandoned Attempt to Paddle Across the Atlantic Ocean |date=April 14, 2016 |first1=Christopher |last1=Parker |publisher=Supracer.com |accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Solo Atlantic crossing==
In a 93-day trek, Bertish successfully completed a solo, unassisted and unaided crossing of the Atlantic Ocean on a stand up paddle board, going from Morocco to Antigua.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/09/sport/chris-bertish-sup-atlantic-crossing/ |title=World-first as man crosses Atlantic Ocean unaided on paddle board |date=March 9, 2017 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pavia"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/standing-room-only-for-paddle-boarder-who-crossed-atlantic-m9hm3t079 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |title=Standing room only for paddle boarder who crossed Atlantic |first1=Will |last1=Pavia |location=New York |date=March 10, 2017 |accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feat was the culmination of five years of preparation.&lt;ref name="Gibbens"/&gt;

On 6 December 2016, Bertish set out from a marina in [[Agadir]], [[Morocco]], in a custom-built {{convert|20|ft|sp=us|abbr=on|0}} stand-up paddle craft on a journey of {{convert|7,400|km|mi}} and 120 days across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the Caribbean island of [[Anegada]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name="NYT01"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/sports/chris-bertish-paddleboard-crossing-atlantic-ocean.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Sports&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article |title=South African Sets Out to Paddle Across the Atlantic |last=Clarke |first=John |date=7 December 2016 |access-date=13 March 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Surfer"&gt;{{cite news |title=Big-Wave Surfer Chris Bertish on his Sup-Transatlantic Crossing: An interview with the man who paddled across an ocean to raise money for charity. |date=March 16, 2017 |first1=Ashtyn |last1=Douglas |url=http://www.surfer.com/features/big-wave-surfer-chris-bertish-on-his-sup-transatlantic-crossing/ |work=[[Surfer Magazine]] |accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rapaport"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2017/03/10/chris-bertish-paddleboard-across-atlantic-ocean-alone |first1=Daniel |last1=Rapaport |date=March 10, 2017 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |title=A human man just paddleboarded across the Atlantic Ocean alone |accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His $120,000 craft was designed by [[Phil Morrison (yacht designer)|Phil Morrison]], a [[naval architect]], and resembles a connected row-boat and a stand-up paddle board, called ImpiFish.&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;  It weighed {{convert|1,350|lbs|kg}}, which Bertish now considers to have been "too light."{{efn-ua|He normally paddles a S.I.C. Bullet 17 paddleboard, which weighs about {{convert|26|lbs|kg}}. "This weighed about 770 pounds, completely dry. Then there was another 330 pounds of gear, 50 liters of emergency water, and then myself on top of it. It was just really difficult to paddle. But I did so much training with the craft and honestly, after a couple weeks of paddling it, it became my norm and my home."&lt;ref name="Surfer"/&gt;  As to the weight, Bertish added: "That sounds heavy ... [but] the craft was much lighter than even the smallest of the boats that have done similar crossings. The craft was probably too light. In the open ocean, you essentially get thrown around like a cork.”&lt;ref name="Gibbens"/&gt;}} It had a "number of technological amenities such as a satellite phone, a radar device, a MacBook, a water maker" {{ndash}} carrying the amount of fresh water he needed was impractical.&lt;ref name="Gibbens"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/03/stand-up-paddle-board-atlantic-chris-bertish/ |title=Surfer Becomes First to Cross the Atlantic on a Paddleboard |first3=Brian, Photographer |last3=Overfelt |first1=Sarah |last1=Gibbens |first2=Delaney |last2=Chambers |work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=March 10, 2017 |accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 9 March 2017, he arrived in [[Antigua]] at [[English Harbour]] becoming the first person to cross the Atlantic on a stand-up paddle board.&lt;ref name="NYT02"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/sports/chris-bertish-paddleboard-atlantic-ocean.html |title=Chris Bertish Becomes First to Cross Atlantic by Paddleboard |last=Clarke |first=John |date=9 March 2017 |access-date=13 March 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made the journey unsupported and unassisted in 93 days.&lt;ref name=NYT02/&gt; Initially he wanted to continue to Florida, but due to forecasted poor weather made his landfall in Antigua.&lt;ref name=NYT02/&gt; 

The craft was self-righting if it [[capsized]], avoiding the possibility of [[Turtling (sailing)|turtling]].  Gear included a [[life raft]], [[flares]], and an emergency [[Bug-out bag|grab bag]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/09/paddleboard-voyage-across-atlantic-completed-in-antigua |title=I'm still standing: paddleboarder makes world-first Atlantic crossing |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 9, 2017 |accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An integral part of maintaining stability in adverse weather was the use of [[sea anchor|sea anchors]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

Bertish averaged {{convert|43|mi|km}} a day, surpassing his planned {{convert|30|mi|km}} daily. Paddling was mainly done at night to avoid [[sun exposure]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;  

The attempt was made in order to raise money for several South African charities to feed, school and provide medical operations for children and succeeded in raising $412,000.&lt;ref name="Surfer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NMax01"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/chris-bertish-paddleboard-across-atlantic/2017/03/10/id/778117/ |title=Chris Bertish: Surfer Is First to Paddleboard Across Atlantic Ocean |last=Krausz |first=Jen |date=10 March 2017 |work=[[Newsmax]] |access-date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charities include Signature of Hope Trust, the Lunchbox Foundation and Operation Smile.&lt;ref name=DailyM01/&gt;{{unreliable source|date=March 2017}} The attempt had been sponsored by the financial group [[Carrick Wealth]].&lt;ref name="Gibbens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesupcrossing.com/#video |publisher=Chris Bertish |title=The SUP Cross Promotional video |format=Video |accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s''''' is a music [[reference book]] authored by American music journalist and essayist [[Robert Christgau]]. It was published in October 1990 by [[Pantheon Books]] as a follow-up to ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981). 

The guide compiles approximately 3,000 [[capsule review|capsule]] album reviews, most of which were originally written by Christgau for his monthly "Consumer Guide" column in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' throughout the 1980s. It covers a variety of genres and musical developments from the decade, which are given an overview in his introductory essays. More insight into his grading criteria is also given in the introduction.

The book was received positively by most critics. Christgau's sensibility and the entertaining, insightful qualities of his judgements were praised, although some deemed the writing too challenging for most readers. It was succeeded in 2000 by ''Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s'', forming a three-volume series of "Consumer Guide" collections.

== Background ==
''Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s'' is the second in a series of books—beginning with 1981's ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Rock Albums of the Seventies]]''—to compile, revise, and expand on Christgau's [[capsule review|capsule]] album reviews, which were originally written for his monthly "Consumer Guide" column in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' throughout the decade specific to each volume.{{sfn|Wolk|2010}} In the process of reviewing 20 records per month for the column, Christgau told the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in 1990 that he had developed into a "processor" of music, with 12 to 14 hours of his day usually spent listening to albums: 

{{quote|"There's something very mechanical about what I do. I'm a sophisticated and very well-oiled machine, but I am a machine. I put the music through my head even when I'm not listening because I know something rubs off. It's not the only way to be a critic. Some listen to the good stuff and listen to it hard and write about that. But in order to provide an overview of good and bad, it`s the only way to do it. I don't do enough to suit myself, but I know I do more than anybody else. So that`s satisfying."{{sfn|Kot|1990}}}}

== Content and scope ==
This book collects approximately 3,000 "Consumer Guide" reviews which range individually from 50 to 150 words—accompanied by a [[Grading in education|letter grade]]—and are arranged as entries, ordered alphabetically by the name of the album's recording artist, and annotated with year of release and record label.{{sfn|Miller|1990|p=78}} The styles of music covered throughout the collection include [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music|pop]], [[country music|country]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[punk rock]], [[post-punk]], and a variety of [[world music]]s, such as [[reggae]] and [[African music|African genres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christgau|1990|loc=back cover}}; {{harvnb|Lawson|1991|p=136}}; {{harvnb|Kot|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first widely published reviewers of [[worldbeat]] music, Christgau included his critiques of music from countries such as Senegal, Nigeria, and South Africa.{{sfn|Kot|1990}}

In the book's introductory essay, Christgau identifies a two-pronged criteria ("importance" and "quality") for the music reviewed in the guide: "Importance divided into cultural impact (commercial or occasionally just sociopolitical reach, with added panache preferred), subcultural acclaim (especially from [[rock criticism]]'s producers and consumers, but also from [[alternative radio]] and dance [[DJs]]), and past performance (increasingly problematic as more and more artists truck on into middle age). Quality boiled down to my grading system." Like the previous volume, the guide follows a grading schema on a scale of A-plus to E-minus, although there are far less records graded C–minus or lower in this volume. B-plus records are the most commonly reviewed in the book, and are defined by Christgau as those offering satisfactory listen through at least half their songs and encourage revisiting: "In school, B+ is a good grade—almost any student will settle for the near-excellence it implies. It's a compliment in the Consumer Guide too."{{sfn|Shuker|1994|pp=70–71}}

There are also introductory essays about musical developments and trends during the 1980s. In one essay, Christgau identifies the fusion of post-punk and [[post-disco]] sounds as one of the decade's major developments while coining the term "[[dance-rock|dance-oriented rock]]" to describe their synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1990|p=78}}; {{harvnb|Campbell|2012|pp=335, 394}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An appendix lists artists overlooked in the reviews and a "core collection" of albums before 1980, including [[out of print]] records categorized as "Gone But Not Forgotten".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1990|p=78}}; {{harvnb|Lawson|1991|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==
''Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s'' was first published in October 1990 by [[Pantheon Books]] and was [[reprint]]ed in 1994 by [[Da Capo Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1990|p=78}}; {{harvnb|Davis|Bristah|Gottlieb|Underwood|1997|p=576}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up to ''The '80s''—''Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s''—was published in 2000, forming a three-volume series of "Consumer Guide" collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robins|2016|p=277}}; {{harvnb|Wolk|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of all three books were made available on Christgau's website after it went online in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matos|2011}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2002|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary reception ==
Reviewing the book in 1991, John Lawson of the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' said it "works well not only by itself, but also as an update" of ''[[The New Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'' (1983) and ''[[Trouser Press|The New Trouser Press Record Guide]]'' (1989), even if it covers only one decade of music.{{sfn|Lawson|1991|p=136}} ''Australian Academic and Research Libraries'', the journal publication of the [[Australian Library and Information Association]], said Christgau "gives full rein to his pithiness and proves just how readable reference books can be".{{sfn|Anon.|1994|p=129}} Fellow rock critic [[Greil Marcus]] remarked on the guide in 1990: "The entries covering a decade's work by a performer sometimes read like tiny novels, full of suspense, dramatic turnarounds, tragedy or farce. But what makes the book work is Christgau's endless capacity for surprise."{{sfn|Christgau|1990|loc=back cover}}

In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Robert Hilburn]] believed the collection of capsule reviews reinforced a number of qualities about Christgau: how his interest extends beyond individual recording artists and into "the state of rock and in the richness of its culture"; how he "constantly challenges artists, fans and other critics to demand more of themselves and their favorites"; and "why he nurtures new and significant developments, however uncommercial or controversial." Hilburn regarded him as the premier reference for popular music, and the journalistic equivalent of [[Bob Dylan]] or [[Neil Young]]: "Quite simply, Christgau writes with the same reckless independence and ferocious eccentricity that fuels our most valuable pop artists."{{sfn|Hilburn|1990}} The book's "charged eloquence" embodied rock music in the mind of ''Chicago Tribune'' critic [[Greg Kot]], who could not recommend it "highly enough", finding the entries on pop singer [[Debbie Gibson]] and hip hop group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] especially fun to read.{{sfn|Kot|1990}}

The book was not without criticism. Hilburn questioned Christgau's "grouchy dismissal" of [[U2]]'s 1980 debut ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]'' while noting a partiality for third-world music records and an impenetrability as a writer, citing the review of the 1987 [[X (American band)|X]] album ''[[See How We Are]]'' as an example of the latter.{{sfn|Hilburn|1990}} Kot believed Christgau was less understanding of metal and also called some of the writing inaccessible: "Sometimes he assumes an intimate understanding of not only the record he's discussing but also a host of peripheral concerns that most of his readers could not possibly possess."{{sfn|Kot|1990}} ''[[Library Journal]]''{{'}}s Barry Miller praised the broad-based musical coverage but deemed the writing glib and unctuous: "Christgau's catholic tastes provide a wonderful cornucopia, but the cumulative effect of his terminally hip prose and gymnastic verbal constructions ('boho Americanism,' 'antipunk discowave,' 'postprog art-rock,' 'mucho pusho,' etc.) is vacuous." Miller recommended ''The New Trouser Press Record Guide'' as an alternative of superior "depth and information".{{sfn|Miller|1990|p=78}}

== Legacy ==
{{see also|Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies#Legacy}}

''Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s'' was used by the [[Music Library Association]] as a reference to prepare select rock recordings for ''A Basic Music Library: Essential Scores and Sound Recordings'' (1997), published by the [[American Library Association]] as a guide for librarians and other collectors.{{sfn|Davis|Bristah|Gottlieb|Underwood|1997|pp=xi, 576}} According to [[M. Thomas Inge]]'s ''[[Greenwood Publishing Group|The Greenwood Guide to American Popular Culture]]'' (2002), ''Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s'' was a precursor to more popular music guide series—such as ''[[AllMusic|All Music Guide]]'', ''[[MusicHound]]'', and ''[[Rough Guides]]''—and has since "maintained a resourceful timelessness ... Christgau's judgments are incisive, knowledgeable, and amusing."{{sfn|Inge|Hall|2002|p=1125}} 

In 2006, the "Consumer Guide" series was ranked fifth on ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s list of the 17 most essential popular music books, with ''The '80s'' singled out as the best of the three; an accompanying blurb said it covered a decade "when [[Top 40]] and [[college radio]] were equally compelling, and Christgau could apply his naturally skeptical eye to artists who either bore the scrutiny, or shrunk away to nothing."{{sfn|Murray|Phipps|Ryan|Modell|2006}} The website's Michaelangelo Matos, who had been greatly influenced by Christgau, said the first two volumes were books he had read most frequently as an adult. Along with Christgau's ability to "distill a record's essence into a handful of words", Murray highlighted his humor, quoting "what remains the single best sentence ever written on [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]" from the review of ''[[Dirty Mind]]'' (1980): "[[Mick Jagger]] should fold up his penis and go home".{{sfn|Matos|2011}} Both the 1970s and 1980s guides were cited by ''[[Nashville Scene]]'' journalist Noel Murray as "seminal works for budding rock critics, who can learn from them the art of concision and the virtue of wielding strong opinions backed by a general spirit of enthusiasm."{{sfn|Murray|2001}}

[[File:Cinematheque quebecoise.JPG|thumb|The Cinémathèque québécoise.]]
The '''Cinémathèque québécoise''' is a [[Film preservation|film conservatory]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. Its purpose is to preserve and document film and television footage and related documents and artifacts for future use by the public.&lt;ref name="Cinémathèque English"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinematheque.qc.ca/cinematheque/history.html|title=A STORY, A MISSION, A SPACE|work=Cinémathèque québécoise Web site|accessdate=2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cinémathèque's collections include over 35,000 films from all eras and countries, 25,000 television programmes, 28,000 posters, 600,000 photos, 2,000 pieces of historical equipment,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/film-found-colour-quebec-1.3505012 "Quebec home movie from 1929 may be some of earliest colour film"].

{{race}}
The '''cross-race effect''' (sometimes called '''cross-race bias''', '''other-race bias''' or '''own-race bias''') is the tendency to more easily recognize faces of the [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] that one is most familiar with (which is most often one's own race). A study was made which examined 271 real court cases.  In photographic line-ups, 231 witnesses participated in cross-race versus same-race identification. In cross-race lineups, only 45% were correctly identified versus 60% for same-race identifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Eyewitness identification in actual criminal cases: An archival analysis.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1023/A:1012840831846|journal = Law and Human Behavior|pages = 475–491|volume = 25|issue = 5|doi = 10.1023/a:1012840831846|first = Bruce W.|last = Behrman|first2 = Sherrie L.|last2 = Davey|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In social psychology, the cross-race effect is described as the "ingroup advantage". In other fields, the effect can be seen as a specific form of the "ingroup advantage" since it is only applied in interracial or inter-ethnic situations, whereas "ingroup advantage" can refer to [[Monoethnicity|mono-ethnic]] situations as well.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. M. Beaupre (2006): An Ingroup Advantage for Confidence in Emotion Recognition Judgments: The Moderating Effect of Familiarity With the Expressions of Outgroup Members. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', volume 32(1), pages 16–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeper study of the cross-race effect has also demonstrated two types of processing for the recognition of faces: featural and holistic. It has been found that holistic processing (which occurs beyond individual parts of the face) is more commonly used in same-race situations, but there is an experience effect, which means that as a person gains more experience with those of a particular race, he or she will begin to use more holistic processing. Featural processing is much more commonly used with an unfamiliar stimulus or face.&lt;ref name="Tanaka"&gt;Tanaka, J. W., Kiefer, M., &amp; Bukach, C. M. (2003). A holistic account of the own-race effect in face recognition: evidence from a cross-cultural stud. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical approaches==
[[File:US Army How To Spot A Jap.png|thumb|50px|"How to Spot a Jap" (1942), produced by the United States Army, attempts to describe the visual differences between Japanese and Chinese, a distinction that was difficult for US soldiers. Click for a larger image.]]

===History===
The first research on the cross-race effect was published in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feingold | first1 = CA | year = 1914 | title = The influence of environment on identification of persons and things | url = | journal = Journal of Criminal Law and Police Science | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 39–51 | doi=10.2307/1133283}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stated that humans tend to perceive people of other races than themselves to all look alike. All else being equal, individuals of a given race are distinguishable from each other in proportion to their familiarity or contact with the race as a whole. Thus, to the uninitiated Caucasian, all East Asian people look alike, while to East Asian people, all Caucasian people look alike.  This does not hold true when people of different races familiarize themselves with races different from their own.

===Ingroup advantage===
Cross-race effect has a strong connection with the ingroup advantage [[phenomenon]]. With [[ingroup]] advantage, people evaluate and judge members of their own self-defined group as being better and fairer than members of other groups ([[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] disadvantage). Social psychologists have demonstrated in the last 30 years that even the smallest aspect of differentiation, like preference for flavor of ice cream or style of music, can trigger ingroup advantage. If the group-building factor is a person's race, then cross-race effect appears.
The favoritism of ingroup members also results from the decreased inborn motivation to read the face of a person of another group or culture. Hess, Senecal &amp; Kirouac&lt;ref&gt;Hess, U.; Kappas, A.; Bause, R. (1995): The intensity of facial expression is determined by underlying affective states and social situations. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', Band 69(2), S. 280-288&lt;/ref&gt; showed in 1996 that the motivation to decode the emotional facial expression instantly decreased when the experimental subject realized that the face belonged to a person of another race

===Cross-race effect and emotion recognition===
A [[meta-analysis]] of several studies about emotion recognition in facial expressions revealed that people could recognize and interpret the emotional facial expression of a person of their own race faster and better than of a person of another race. These findings apply to all races in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Elfenbein, H.A. &amp; Ambidi, N. (2002): On the universality and cultural specificity of emotion recognition: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin'', Band 128(2), S. 203–235&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies show that other races, compared to one's own race, have differently shaped faces and different details within a facial expression, making it difficult for members of other races to decode emotional expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, T.; Cooper, C. &amp; Mullen, B. (1992): Cross-racial facial identification: A social cognitive integration. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', Band 18, S. 296–301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sporer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sporer|first=Siegfried Ludwig|title=Recognizing faces of other ethnic groups: An integration of theories.|journal=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law|date=1 January 2001|volume=7|issue=1|pages=36–97|doi=10.1037/1076-8971.7.1.36}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have shown that the mood of the observer does not affect the cross-race effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teitelbaum|first=S.|author2=Geiselman, R. E.|title=Observer Mood and Cross-Racial Recognition of Faces|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|date=1 January 1997|volume=28|issue=1|pages=93–106|doi=10.1177/0022022197281006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social cognition===
Research has shown that people tend to think more categorically about outgroup members and more individually about ingroup members.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  For example, outgroup members may associate specific facial features with a particular race or ethnicity, and do not notice the subtle variations in skin tone, eye color, or hair texture that ingroup members recognize. Categorical thinking happens more consistently for outgroup participants while individuation does the exact opposite.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  These different views between outgroup and ingroup members have been known to bias conceptual cognitive processes and show that the cross-race effect actually has less to do with race than with different levels of cognitive processing that occur for ingroup and outgroup members.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;

==== Cognitive disregard====
Another set of cognitive theories related to cross-race effect focuses on how social categorization and individuation biases face memory.&lt;ref name=You&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=S. G.|author2=Hugenberg, K. |author3=Bernstein, M. J. |author4= Sacco, D. F. |title=Perception and Motivation in Face Recognition: A Critical Review of Theories of the Cross-Race Effect|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=30 August 2011|volume=16|issue=2|pages=116–142|doi=10.1177/1088868311418987|pmid=21878608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers believe that the inability for ingroup members' to recognize differences in the features of outgroup members can be explained through cognitive disregard.&lt;ref name=Sporer /&gt; They find that the likelihood of falsely identifying a member of an out-group stems from an automatic encoding of a face without processing its unique features.&lt;ref name=Sporer /&gt; Thus, when presented with an out-group member who has a similar face to the one that was encoded, the in-group member automatically, but incorrectly determines that the face has been "seen" before.&lt;ref name=Sporer /&gt; These studies conclude that diminishing the cross race effect requires individuals to process ethnically-differing faces with the goal of encoding with individuation.&lt;ref name=Sporer /&gt;

====Depth of processing hypothesis====
Depth of processing also influences the presence of the cross race effect.&lt;ref name=Meissner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meissner|first=Christian A.|author2=Brigham, John C. |author3=Butz, David A. |title=Memory for own- and other-race faces: a dual-process approach|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|date=1 July 2005|volume=19|issue=5|pages=545–567|doi=10.1002/acp.1097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-race faces are more correctly and easily discerned because deep processing, than other-race faces are.&lt;ref name=Meissner /&gt; This hypothesis, however, is controversial because of its inability to be replicated within studies.&lt;ref name=Meissner /&gt;

====Challenges for social cognition models====
There are two challenges to the social cognition models (a) mixed evidence dealing with race accessibility, face perception, and memory and (b) the effects of development and training on the cross-race effect.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  Regarding the mixed evidence, the popular belief is that the more someone is exposed to people of different races the less likely they will be affected by the cross-race effect.&lt;ref name=You /&gt; There have been studies that support this theory, but other research has shown mixed results.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  For example, the results of studies done where the accessibility, as in how easy or not it is for a person to be around people of difference races, to different races is manipulated, showed that this does not always affect face memory.&lt;ref name=You /&gt; Second regarding the development and training effects, just because someone shows improvement with dealing with the cross-race effect due to exposure to cross race training or experience, it is not a direct prediction of a good social cognitive model.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  For the social cognitive model to start explaining such effects there would have to be evidence that ingroup and outgroup distinctions occur developmentally at the exact time the cross-race effect emerges in a child.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  There is some evidence showing when the cross-race effect first emerges, but there is little research directly testing the onset of ingroup and outgroup recognition biases in young children.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;

===Perceptual expertise hypothesis===

The perceptual expertise theory also suggest that if we identify the perceptual learning mechanisms that control perceptual expertise with face and non-face stimuli we will understand the cross-race effect.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  There are many models that deal with perceptual expertise, but all of these models share the idea that a human's face processing ability does not generalize equally to all faces.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  Hence, these theories propose that racial segregation results in people developing better expertise in distinguishing between faces of our own race or of a different race.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  Research around these theories also suggests that the more a child is exposed to cross-race face processing the lower the cross-race effect.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  However, if the child is not exposed to a lot of cross-race face processing the cross-race effect can increase.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  Furthermore, there is evidence that long term and short term exposure to cross-race face processing can improve recognition.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;

====Challenges for perceptual expertise models====

Challenges to the perceptual expertise models are the mixed evidence for the interracial contact hypothesis, and the varied results of the training effect.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;   The mixed evidence shows that although there is some support to the theory that the more interracial contact a person has the better a person is at cross-race recognition, all the evidence gathered does not come to the same conclusion.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  This mixture of results causes the relationship between cross-race exposure and recognition ability to weaken.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  However, there may also be a third factor that contributes to these inconsistent findings.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  There is some evidence that the quality of cross-race contact has an effect on this relationship.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  For example, research supports the position that to be able to recognize cross-race faces one has to be attentive and effortful when encoding the face into memory.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  Training individuals has been shown to reduce the cross race effect in people, however this quick onset is coupled with a quick off set of the ability.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  Although, this short term training can translate into long term training, it is not the same as actually having real life experience with the cross-race effect.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;  Finally, there are also other processes besides perceptual expertise that can influence cross-race recognition.&lt;ref name=You /&gt;

===Effects of social cognition===
Another reason the cross-race-effect may occur is that perceptions are often affected by motivations, expectations, and social cognition. Overall, the creation of norms has shaped and biased even simple perceptions such as line lengths. In terms of perception of faces, studies have shown that racially ambiguous faces that have been identified as one race or another based on their hairstyle are identified as having more features of the racial category represented by the hairstyle. Similarly, faces of an ambiguous but equal shade are interpreted as darker or lighter when accompanied by the label of either "black" or "white", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Corneille | first1 = O. | last2 = Potter | first2 = T. | last3 = Hugenberg | first3 = K. | year = 2007 | title = Applying the attractor field model to social cognition: perceptual discrimination is facilitated, but memory is impaired for faces displaying evaluatively congruent expressions | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 93 | issue = 3| pages = 335–352 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.93.3.335 | pmid=17723052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration of cross-race effect theories===

====Prototypes====
Individuals develop and store a face prototype each time they encounter a face unique to ones he or she has previously encountered (usually ones that differ in features compared to his or her ethnic group).&lt;ref name=Sporer /&gt; From their studies, researchers have concluded that when an individual belonging to an ethnicity that differs from his or her own, he or she forms a prototype and reserves it for future use, if and when necessary.&lt;ref name=Sporer /&gt; The prototype view raises concern, however, because individuals storing these unique faces may ignore the fact that everyone has features that may be only special to his or her makeup, and may not apply to everyone belonging to that particular ethnic group or race; thus, this results in more false alarms during eyewitness testimony or identifying perpetrators in lineups.&lt;ref name=Sporer /&gt;

===Race-feature theory===

In his 1996 study, researchers noticed that when looking at ethnicity, in-group faces are processed without acknowledgement of ethnic-specific details and features.&lt;ref name=Sporer /&gt;  People code faces that deviate from the norm of their ethnic group through the absence or presence of distinctive ethnic features.&lt;ref name=Sporer /&gt;

This is supported by the finding that the classification of other-race faces tends to be faster than same-race faces. This suggests that race seems to be a more perceptually salient feature than other more discerning facial features when the face belongs to a different race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levin | first1 = D. T. | year = 1996 | title = Classifying faces by race. The structure of face categories | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 1364–1382 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.22.6.1364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[eye tracking]] studies found tentative evidence for such a hypothesis by demonstrating that people look at different facial features in same- versus other-race faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brielmann | first1 = A. A. | last2 = Bülthoff | first2 = I. | last3 = Armann | first3 = R. | year = 2014 | title = Looking at faces from different angles: Europeans fixate different features in Asian and Caucasian faces | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 105–112 | doi=10.1016/j.visres.2014.04.011 | pmid=24796509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wheeler | first1 = A. | last2 = Anzures | first2 = G. | last3 = Quinn | first3 = P. C. | last4 = Pascalis | first4 = O. | last5 = Omrin | first5 = D. S. | last6 = Lee | first6 = K. | year = 2011 | title = Caucasian infants scan own- and other-race faces differently | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0018621 | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 4| page = e18621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldinger | first1 = S.

H. | year = 2009 | title = Deficits in cross-race face learning: Insights from eye movements and pupillometry | doi = 10.1037/a0016548 | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 1105–1122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fu | first1 = G. | last2 = Hu | first2 = C. S. | last3 = Wang | first3 = Q. | last4 = Quinn | first4 = P. C. | last5 = Lee | first5 = K. | year = 2012 | title = Adults scan own- and other-race faces differently | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0037688 | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 6| page = e37688 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general trend observed is that people fixate the eyes of a face with higher probability if it belongs to the same ethnic group as the observer her- or himself. However, other studies found just as pronounced differences between Asian and European ''observers′'' looking behavior and these differences were stable for both own- and other-race faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blais | first1 = C. | last2 = Jack | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Scheepers | first3 = C. | last4 = Fiset | first4 = D. | last5 = Caldara | first5 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Culture shapes how we look at faces | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0003022 | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 3 | issue = 8| page = e3022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Miellet | first2 = S. | last3 = Caldara | first3 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Culture shapes eye movements for visually homogeneous objects | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2010.00006 | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was previously explained as stemming from a more clustered density-gradient for other-race faces than same race faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valentine | first1 = T. | last2 = Endo | first2 = M. | year = 1992 | title = Towards an exemplar model of face processing: The effects of race and distinctiveness | doi = 10.1080/14640749208401305 | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 44A | issue = | pages = 671–703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning is that this causes more nodes to become activated in reaction to an other-race face, resulting in faster classification, but less discriminability in terms of memory. However, these exemplar-based theories cannot explain why faces that are ambiguous in terms of social category information can influence recognition.

===Contact hypothesis theory===
One method researchers have suggested to help mollify the prevelence of the cross race effect is through application of the contact hypothesis. Accurate recognition and identification of other-race faces, researchers have deduced, stems from a difference in learning experiences that relate to individual ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=Combs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Combs|first=G. M.|author2=Griffith, J.|title=An Examination of Interracial Contact:The Influence of Cross-Race Interpersonal Efficacy and Affect Regulation|journal=Human Resource Development Review|date=1 September 2007|volume=6|issue=3|pages=222–244|doi=10.1177/1534484307303990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cross race effect can be reduced by continual exposure ethnic groups that differ from one's own; the more positive interactions that occur between two ethnic groups, the more heterogeneous the ethnicities will seem to be.&lt;ref name=Combs /&gt; The type of contact experienced between the two ethnic groups also plays a major role in this hypothesis' effectiveness; the more intimate the contact, the higher the chances become of accurately recognizing a member of a different ethnicity than one's own&lt;ref name=Combs /&gt;

Although most studies done about the cross race effect are with black and white participants, there are also numerous studies done with people of different ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Brig&gt;{{cite book|editor=Michael P. Toglia|title=Handbook of eyewitness psychology.|year=2007|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=978-1-4106-1491-9|pages=257–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are studies done that compare Hispanic with black and white participants, black with white and Japanese participants, Chinese with Korean and white participants, Chinese with Indian and other East Asian ethnic participants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perera-W.A.|first1=Hiran|title=The Effects of Memory Conformity and the Cross-Race Effect in Eyewitness Testimony|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2732189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish and German participants, and finally a study has been done comparing Arab and Israeli Jews.&lt;ref name=Brig /&gt;  The data from all of these studies have come to the same conclusion. The cross-race effect is evident among all people of all different races.&lt;ref name=Brig /&gt;

===Morphological basis===
The cross race effect has a morphological basis: The facial appearance is morphologically different for different ethnic backgrounds. This has been established empirically,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Salah| first=Albert Ali|author2=Alyüz, Neşe |author3=Akarun, Lale |title=Registration of 3D Face Scans with Average Face Models | journal=Journal of Electronic Imaging|year=2008|volume=17 | issue = 1 |page=011006|doi= 10.1117/1.2896291}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein a large set of 3D scans of faces from different ethnic backgrounds was automatically clustered into groups. Only facial landmark distances were used in this grouping. The result was that gender, as well as ethnicity, emerged as primary factors of group membership.

===Immersion vs. upbringing===

====Children and face identification====
With the help of several conducted studies, researchers conclude that the accuracy of eyewitness memory is significantly affected by the ethnic identity of both the suspect and the eye-witness; an individual can more accurately recognize a face belonging to his or her race than an individual whose race differs from that of his or her own.&lt;ref name=Pezdek&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pezdek|first=Kathy|author2=Blandon-Gitlin, Iris |author3=Moore, Catherine |title=Children's face recognition memory: More evidence for the cross-race effect|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1 January 2003|volume=88|issue=4|pages=760–763|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.4.760|pmid=12940414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous studies have analyzed how the cross-race effect affects adults during eyewitness testimony but fails to address the possible existence of age-related confounding factors:  On one hand, as an individual grows older and encounters more members of the other ethnic group in question, the novelty of the ethnic difference wears off and makes it less distracting, and the individual can pay higher absolute and relative amounts of attention to subtle distinctions between members of that group; on the other hand, time also increases the individual's exposure to biases prevalent in his/her own in-group, as well as compounding the effects of any self-reinforcement bias that the individual exhibits with respect to his/her preexisting opinions.&lt;ref name=Pezdek /&gt; The literature available on this topic is minute and conflicting; some researchers have found a prevalence of the cross-race effect in both white and black children,&lt;ref name=Pezdek /&gt; yet others have reported findings of children possessing the ability to discern other-race faces accurately.&lt;ref name=Pezdek /&gt; In their aim to identify developmental differences, researchers such as Pezdek et al.&lt;ref name=Pezdek /&gt; discovered that children recognize faces belonging to their own race more effectively than faces belonging to another race.&lt;ref name=Pezdek /&gt;

==Consequences==

===Cross-race identification bias===

This effect refers to the decreased ability of people of one race to recognize faces and facial expressions of people of another race. This differs from the cross-race bias because this effect is found mostly during [[eyewitness identification]] as well as identification of a suspect in a [[police lineup|line-up]]. In these situations, many people feel as if races other than their own look alike, and they have difficulty distinguishing between members of different ethnic groups. Cross-race identification bias is also known as the misinformation effect since people are considered to be misinformed about other races and have difficulty identifying them. In a study dealing with eyewitness testimony, investigators examined forty participants in a racially diverse area of the US. Participants watched a video of a property crime being committed, then in the next 24 hours came to pick the suspect out of a photo line-up. Most of the participants in the study either misidentified the suspect or stated the suspect was not in the line-up at all. Correct identification of the suspect occurred more often when the eyewitness and the suspect were of the same race.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson, S. &amp; Holmes, M. (2008). Cross-race recognition deficit and visual attention: do they all look (at faces) alike?. ''Proceeding ETRA '08 Proceedings of the 2008 symposium on Eye tracking research &amp; applications.'' ACM New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  In another study, 86 convenience store clerks were asked to identify three customers: one white, one black, and one Mexican, all of whom had purchased in the store earlier that day. The clerks tended to identify customers belonging to their own race accurately, but were more likely to make errors when attempting to identify other races members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Platz | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Hosch | first2 = H. M. | year = 1988 | title = Cross-Racial/Ethnic Eyewitness Identification: A Field Study | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 11| pages = 972–984 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1988.tb01187.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, another study found that "alcohol intoxication reduces the own-race bias in face recognition," albeit by impairing accurate perception and leaving in place or increasing random error rather than by improving facial recognition of members of other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hilliar | first1 = K. | last2 = Kemp | first2 = R. | last3 = Denson | first3 = T. | year = 2010 | title = Now Everyone Looks The Same: Alcohol Intoxication Reduces The Own-Race Bias in Face Recognition | url = | journal = Law and Human Behavior | volume = 34 | issue = 5| pages = 367–368 | doi=10.1007/s10979-009-9204-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some disagreement about the consistency of the own-race bias. However, data gathered from multiple studies does show that the own-race bias is consistent.&lt;ref name=Both&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bothwell|first=R. K.|author2=Brigham, J. C. |author3=Malpass, R. S. |title=Cross-Racial Identification|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1 March 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=19–25|doi=10.1177/0146167289151002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The own-race bias occurs in people of all races.&lt;ref name=Both /&gt; Since eyewitness identification can be problematic, researches have started to conduct studies of own-race biases using more forensics.&lt;ref name=Both /&gt; This kind of research needs to pay more attention to a target's distinctive features and level of attractiveness.&lt;ref name=Both /&gt; If a target is very distinctive or very attractive, it could reduce the cross-race effect because that person would be easier to identify.&lt;ref name=Both /&gt;

Psychological experts all agree that the cross-race effect is a common occurrence during in-court testimony when an eyewitness is trying to remember a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sporer|first=Siegfried Ludwig|title=The cross-race effect: Beyond recognition of faces in the laboratory.|journal=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law|date=1 January 2001|volume=7|issue=1|pages=170–200|doi=10.1037/1076-8971.7.1.170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reduce the cross-race effect there have been multiple changes to how policemen handle eyewitness identification.&lt;ref name=Revlin /&gt; For example, to reduce the cross-race identification bias Britain has a law that states police must include the suspect in a line up with at least eight other people who share similar characteristics to him or her.&lt;ref name=Revlin&gt;{{cite book|last=Revlin|first=Russell|title=Human Cognition : Theory and Practice.|year=2007|publisher=Worth Pub|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780716756675|pages=110–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This forces the eyewitness to use his or her memory of the suspects features, not the suspect's race, as a form of identification.&lt;ref name=Revlin /&gt;

===Economic===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
In a globalized world, in which different cultures and races collaborate and negotiate about contracts, licenses, rights and political decisions, one clearly sees the negative impacts of the cross-race effect. Prof. Thomas (Department of Intercultural Communication, Regensburg, Germany) stated that at least 50% of Western-Chinese negotiations fail due to impaired communication. Even signed contracts lead to suboptimal results in 60–70% of the cases. "Trends in Managing Mobility 2007"&lt;ref&gt;ECA International (2007): ''Trends in Managing Mobility 2007''&lt;/ref&gt; found that 30% of the failed negotiations could be indirectly traced back to the cross-race effect. Consequences of the cross-race effect include reduced emotional intelligence, negative evaluation of trustworthiness, reduced ability to communicate, lack of empathy and a decreased ability to judge the overall situation of a negotiation.

==Ways to reduce cross-race effect==
A study was done in which participants were forewarned about cross-race effect. Results from this study showed that the cross-race effect could be reduced and sometimes even eliminated when participants were wary of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hugenberg | first1 = K. | last2 = Miller | first2 = J. | last3 = Claypool | first3 = H.

==Related biases==
Similar biases have been found for aspects other than race. There is an own-gender bias, although evidence suggests that this comes down to hair style recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691803000520 | doi=10.1016/S0001-6918(03)00052-0 | volume=114 | title=An own gender bias and the importance of hair in face recognition | journal=Acta Psychologica | pages=101–114 | year=2003 | last1 = Wright | first1 = Daniel B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is{{Clarify|date=April 2016}} an own-age bias where people are better at recognising people of a similar age as themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2010.537926|title=The own-age face recognition bias in children and adults|doi=10.1080/17470218.2010.537926|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=64|issue=1|year=2011|author1=Peter J.

Ethelwyn Manning (23 November 1885 – 1 June 1972) was the second Chief Librarian of the [[Frick Art Reference Library]]. During [[World War II]], she assisted the Committee of the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) on Protection of Cultural Treasures in War Areas, later known as the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] (MFAA).

==Education==

Manning graduated from [[Smith College]] in 1908 and the school of Library Science at [[Simmons College]] in 1911. She also studied at the Training School for Children's Librarians at the [[Carnegie Library]], Pittsburgh.

==Career==

Manning began her career as a Children's Librarian at the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] in 1909. She subsequently held positions in the public libraries of [[Burlington, Iowa]], [[Cedar Rapids]], Iowa, and [[Milton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iowa Library Quarterly'' (1912). Volume 6, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, she was appointed Head Cataloger of the [[Amherst College]] Library in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;''Library Journal'' (1917). Volume 42 (February), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1924, Manning was appointed the second Chief Librarian of the Frick Art Reference Library, a research institute dedicated to promoting the study of art history and related subjects that had been founded four years earlier by [[Helen Clay Frick]] as a memorial to her father, the collector [[Henry Clay Frick]].&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Katharine McCook (1979). ''The Story of the Frick Art Reference Library: The Early Years''. New York: The Library, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Manning worked at the Frick Art Reference Library for twenty-four years, overseeing the institution's transfer from its original location in a two and one-half story building at 6 East 71st Street to its present thirteen story building located at 10 East 71st Street.&lt;ref&gt;Knox (1979), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, when the Committee of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (ACLS) on Protection of Cultural Treasures in War Areas was in residence at the Library, she worked alongside art historians on the Committee to prepare maps detailing the location of art treasures and landmarks in war zones and in danger of Nazi plundering. Manning was also instrumental in developing the institution's collection of study photographs of works of art, acquiring thousands of reproductions from European photographers and hiring photographers in the United States to travel through the country and photograph inaccessible paintings in private collections.&lt;ref&gt; Knox (1979), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting collection, which presently comprises more than one million images, documents the Western artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt; Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive: Holdings (2015). http://www.frick.org/research/photoarchive/holdings.

'''Everett Marshall''' (November 4, 1905 - February 10, 1973) was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who was best known for his work in the late 1930s with what is now [[National Wrestling Alliance]]. His ring name was the Blonde Bear.

== Biography ==
Everett Marshall was born on November 4, 1905 in La Junta, Colorado . His finisher was [[Professional wrestling throws#Airplane spin|The Airplane Spin]] and he liked to use Armlocks and Armpulls. He had a wonderful career of 22 years. He is best known for his work with [[National Wrestling Alliance]]. He started his first stint with [[Midwest Wrestling Association]] where he won his first title which was the [[MWA World Heavyweight Championship|MWA Heavyweight Championship]] on August 14, 1932.

=== National Wrestling Association stint ===
Everett Marshall joined [[National Wrestling Association]] in 1934. It was a subsidiary of the [[World Boxing Association|National Boxing Association]]. On June 26, 1936, he beat Ali Baba for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)|National Wrestling Association World Championship]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. His title was vacated in September 1936 because NBA and NWA recommended at their annual meeting that a tournament would be held.

==== Texas Heavyweight Champion ====
In 1938, Marshall continued to tour [[Texas]]. In March 1938, he defeated Chief Little Beaver to win the [[NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship|Texas Heavyweight Championship]].  His title is believed to have been vacated in September 1938 because he went on to win two [[World Championship|world titles]] during that time.

==== Dual World Champion ====
On September 14, 1938, Marshall was awarded the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|National Wrestling Alliance World Heavyweight Championship]] and National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Championship (both of them were called NWA World Heavyweight Championship). This marked his second National Wrestling Association title reign.  He was awarded the title when [[Steve Casey]] was stripped of the title for refusal to defend the titles.  Marshall lost his titles to [[Lou Thesz]] on February 23, 1939.  After that, he continued to wrestle for [[National Wrestling Alliance]] until 1949 when he fell into full-retirement.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;His reign with the title occurred before the NWA took control of the championship and, actually, took place before the NWA was created.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;His reign occurred prior to the formation of the NWA and the title being renamed the NWA World Heavyweight Championship&lt;/small&gt;

[[File:Frohawk Dodo.png|thumb|Frederick William Frohawk's restoration of the extinct [[dodo]].]]
'''''Extinct Birds''''' (complete title: '''''Extinct birds. An attempt to unite in one volume a short account of those Birds which have become extinct in historical times—that is, within the last six or seven hundred years. To which are added a few which still exist, but are on the verge of extinction.''''') is a book by [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]] which covers globally extinct and rare birds as well as  [[hypothetical extinct species]] which include bird taxa whose existence is only based on written or oral reports or on paintings. The accounts of the [[List of extinct birds|extinct bird taxa]] are based on Rothschild's lecture ''On extinct and vanishing birds'' published in the Proceedings of the 4th [[International Ornithological Congress]] 1905 in London.

Subsequent authors like [[Errol Fuller]] were influenced by Rothschild's reference work. Fuller published an eponymous book in 1987 with a foreword written by [[Miriam Rothschild]] and also used color plates from Rothschild's work.&lt;ref name = Fuller1987&gt;{{cite book |title = Extinct Birds |first = Errol |last = Fuller | authorlink=Errol Fuller |year = 1987| publisher = Penguin Books (England) |isbn = 978-0-670-81787-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limited number==
Only 300 copies were published in 1907 at [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson and Co.]] in [[London]]. All copies were registered  and personally signed by Rothschild.

==Plates==
The 45 color paintings and 4 grayscale sketches are by [[John Gerrard Keulemans]], [[George Edward Lodge]], [[Henrik Grönvold]], [[Frederick William Frohawk]], and [[Joseph Smit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Richmond | first1 = C.

'''''Gesta Annalia''''' ("Yearly Deeds") is an important medieval chronicle detailing the [[history of Scotland]].

The history seems to be split into two main sections. Whilst ''Gesta Annalia I'' seems to concern events to February 1285, ''Gesta Annalia II'' appears to concern events between October 1285 to 1363.&lt;ref&gt;[[#B2|Broun (2007a)]] p. 52; [[#B1|Broun (2007b)]] p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of ''Gesta Annalia I'' was likely completed in 1285, between February and the middle of April.&lt;ref&gt;[[#B1|Broun (2007b)]] pp. 175, 186 n. 52, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The State Hermitage Museum'''&lt;!--English-language name used on museum's official website; see Talk page--&gt; ({{lang-rus|Госуда́рственный Эрмита́ж|r=Gosudárstvennyj Ermitáž|p=ɡəsʊˈdarstvʲɪnɨj ɪrmʲɪˈtaʂ|links=no}}) is a [[museum]] of art and culture in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. The [[list of largest art museums|second-largest art museum]] in the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/museum-galleries/#page=1 ''Top 10 Museums and Galleries'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cityvision2000.com - [http://www.cityvision2000.com/city_tour/hermitage.htm The Winter Palace and the Hermitage Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; it was founded in 1764 when Empress [[Catherine the Great]] acquired an impressive collection of paintings from the Berlin merchant [[Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky]]. The museum celebrates the anniversary of its founding each year on 7 December, [[Saint Catherine's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/wcm/connect/6b172326-4c3c-45c5-a3c2-182056a64777/The+State+Hermitage+Museum+Annual+Report+2013.pdf?MOD=AJPERES Page 7]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been open to the public since 1852.

Its collections, of which only a small part is on permanent display, comprise over three million items (the numismatic collection accounts for about one-third of them),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/wcm/connect/6b172326-4c3c-45c5-a3c2-182056a64777/The+State+Hermitage+Museum+Annual+Report+2013.pdf?MOD=AJPERES Page 20]&lt;/ref&gt; including the largest collection of paintings in the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The collections occupy a large complex of six historic buildings along [[Palace Embankment]], including the [[Winter Palace]], a former residence of Russian emperors. Apart from them, the [[Menshikov Palace]], Museum of Porcelain, Storage Facility at Staraya Derevnya, and the eastern wing of the [[General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg)|General Staff Building]] are also part of the museum. The museum has several exhibition centers abroad. The Hermitage is a federal state property. Since July 1992, the director of the museum has been [[Mikhail Piotrovsky]].&lt;ref name=Director&gt;{{cite web |title= Mikhail Piotrovsky |url= http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/about/hermitage_director/?lng=en |website= The State Hermitage Museum  |access-date= 19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the six buildings in the main museum complex, five—namely the Winter Palace, Small Hermitage, Old Hermitage, New Hermitage, and [[Hermitage Theatre]]—are open to the public. The entrance ticket for foreign tourists costs more than the fee paid by citizens of Russia and Belarus. However, entrance is free of charge the first Thursday of every month for all visitors, and free daily for students and children. The museum is closed on Mondays. The entrance for individual visitors is located in the Winter Palace, accessible from the Courtyard.

==Etymology==
A hermitage is the dwelling of a hermit or recluse. The word derives from Old French ''hermit, ermit'' "hermit, recluse", from Late Latin ''eremita'', from Greek ''eremites'', literally "people who live alone", which is in turn derived from ἐρημός (''erēmos''), "desert". The building was initially given this name because of its exclusivity - in its early days, only very few people were allowed to visit.

==Buildings==
Originally, the only building housing the collection was the "Small Hermitage". Today, the Hermitage Museum encompasses many buildings on the Palace Embankment and its neighbourhoods. Apart from the Small Hermitage, the museum now also includes the "Old Hermitage" (also called "Large Hermitage"), the "New Hermitage", the "[[Hermitage Theatre]]", and the "[[Winter Palace]]", the former main residence of the Russian tsars. In recent years, the Hermitage has expanded to the [[General Staff Building]] on the [[Palace Square]] facing the Winter Palace, and the [[Menshikov Palace]].

[[Image:HermitageAcrossNeva-2.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4|The Hermitage Museum complex. From left to right: Hermitage Theatre – Old Hermitage – Small Hermitage – Winter Palace (the "New Hermitage" is situated behind the Old Hermitage).]]

==Collections==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
The Western European Art collection includes European paintings, sculpture, and applied art from the 13th to the 20th centuries. It is displayed, in about 120 rooms, on the first and second floor of the four main buildings. Drawings and prints are displayed in temporary exhibitions.

===Egyptian antiquities===
{{main|Egyptian Collection of the Hermitage Museum}}
[[File:8600 - St Petersburg - Hermitage - Egyptian antiquities.jpg|thumb|upright|Egyptian Hall]]
Since 1940, the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] collection, dating back to 1852 and including the former [[Carlo Ottavio, Count Castiglione|Castiglione]] Collection, has occupied a large hall on the ground floor in the eastern part of the Winter Palace. It serves as a passage to the exhibition of Classical Antiquities. A modest collection of the culture of [[Ancient Mesopotamia]], including a number of [[Assyria]]n reliefs from [[Babylon]], [[Dur-Sharrukin]] and [[Nimrud]], is located in the same part of the building.

===Classical antiquities===
The collection of classical antiquities occupies most of the ground floor of the Old and New Hermitage buildings. The interiors of the ground floor were designed by German architect [[Leo von Klenze]] in the [[Greek revival]] style in the early 1850s, using [[faux painting|painted]] polished [[stucco]] and columns of natural [[marble]] and [[granite]]. One of the largest and most notable interiors of the first floor is the Hall of Twenty Columns, divided into three parts by two rows of grey monolithic columns of [[Serdobol]] granite, intended for the display of Graeco-Etruscan vases. Its floor is made of a modern marble mosaic imitating ancient tradition, while the stucco walls and ceiling are covered in painting.

The Room of the Great Vase in the western wing features the {{convert|2.57|m|ft|abbr=on}} high Kolyvan Vase, weighing {{convert|19|t|lb|abbr=on}}, made of [[jasper]] in 1843 and installed before the walls were erected. While the western wing was designed for exhibitions, the rooms on the ground floor in the eastern wing of the New Hermitage, now also hosting exhibitions, were originally intended for [[libraries]]. The floor of the Athena Room in the south-eastern corner of the building, one of the original libraries, is decorated with an authentic 4th-century mosaic excavated in an early Christian [[basilica]] in [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]] in 1854.

The collection of classical antiquities features Greek artifacts from the third millennium – fifth century BC, [[Pottery of ancient Greece|ancient Greek pottery]], items from the Greek cities of the North [[Black Sea|Pontic]] [[Greek colonies]], [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] sculpture and jewellery, including [[engraved gem]]s and [[cameo (carving)|cameos]], such as the famous Gonzaga Cameo, Italic art from the 9th to second century BC, Roman marble and bronze sculpture and applied art from the first century BC - fourth century AD, including copies of Classical and Hellenistic Greek sculptures. One of the highlights of the collection is the [[Tauride Venus]], which, according to latest research, is an original Hellenistic Greek sculpture rather than a Roman copy as it was thought before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, only a few pieces of authentic [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] sculpture and sepulchral monuments.

===Prehistoric art===
On the ground floor in the western wing of the Winter Palace the collections of [[prehistoric]] artifacts and the culture and art of the Caucasus are located, as well as the second treasure gallery. The prehistoric artifacts date from the [[Paleolithic]] to the [[Iron Age]] and were excavated all over Russia and other parts of the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russian Empire]]. Among them is a renowned collection of the art and culture of nomadic tribes of the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] from [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]] and Bashadar sites, including the world's oldest surviving knotted-pile [[carpet]] and a well-preserved wooden [[chariot]], both from the 4th–3rd centuries BC. The Caucasian exhibition includes a collection of [[Urartu]] artifacts from [[Armenia]] and Western [[Armenia]]. Many of them were excavated at [[Teishebaini]] under the supervision of [[Boris Piotrovsky]], former director of the Hermitage Museum.

===Jewelry and decorative art===
Four small rooms on the ground floor, enclosed in the middle of the New Hermitage between the room displaying Classical Antiquities, comprise the first treasure gallery, featuring western jewellery from the 4th millennium BC to the early 20th century AD. The second treasure gallery, located on the ground floor in the southwest corner of the Winter Palace, features jewellery from the [[Pontic steppe]]s, [[Caucasus]] and Asia, in particular [[Scythian]] and [[Sarmatian]] gold. Visitors may only visit the treasure galleries as part of a guided tour.

[[Image:Ermitáž (18).jpg|thumb|left|The Pavilion Hall]]
Pavilion Hall, designed by [[Andrei Stackenschneider]] in 1858, occupies the first floor of the Northern Pavilion in the Small Hermitage. It features the 18th-century golden Peacock Clock by [[James Cox (inventor)|James Cox]] and a collection of [[mosaic]]s. The floor of the hall is adorned with a 19th-century imitation of an ancient Roman mosaic.

Two galleries spanning the west side of the Small Hermitage from the Northern to Southern Pavilion house an exhibition of Western European decorative and applied art from the 12th to 15th century and the fine art of the [[Low Countries]] from the 15th and 16th centuries.

===Italian Renaissance===
The rooms on the first floor of the Old Hermitage were designed by Andrei Stakenschneider in revival styles in between 1851 and 1860, although the design survives only in some of them. They feature works of [[Italian Renaissance]] artists, including [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], as well as ''[[Benois Madonna]]'' and ''[[Madonna Litta]]'' attributed to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] or his school.

[[Image:Ermitáž (26).jpg|thumb|upright|The Small Italian Skylight Room]]
The Italian Renaissance galleries continues in the eastern wing of the New Hermitage with paintings, sculpture, [[Maiolica|majolica]] and [[tapestry]] from Italy of the 15th–16th centuries, including ''[[Conestabile Madonna]]'' and ''Madonna with Beardless St. Joseph'' by [[Raphael]]. The gallery known as the Raphael Loggias, designed by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]] and painted by [[Cristopher Unterberger]] and his workshop in the 1780s as a replication of the loggia in the [[Apostolic Palace]] in Rome frescoed by Raphael, runs along the eastern facade.

===Italian and Spanish fine art===
The first floor of New Hermitage contains three large interior spaces in the center of the museum complex with red walls and lit from above by skylights. These are adorned with 19th-century Russian lapidary works and feature Italian and Spanish canvases of the 16th-18th centuries, including [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Giambattista Pittoni]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]]. In the [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of smaller rooms alongside the skylight rooms the Italian and Spanish fine art of the 15th-17th centuries, including [[Michelangelo]]'s ''Crouching Boy'' and paintings by [[El Greco]].

The museum also houses paintings by [[Luis Tristán]], [[Francisco de Zurbarán]], [[Alonso Cano]], [[Jusepe de Ribera|José de Ribera]] and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]].

===Knights' Hall===
The Knights' Hall, a large room in the eastern part of the New Hermitage originally designed in the Greek revival style for the display of coins, now hosts a collection of Western European arms and armour from the 15th-17th centuries, part of the Hermitage Arsenal collection. The Hall of Twelve Columns, in the southeast corner of the New Hermitage, is adorned with columns of grey [[Serdobol]] [[granite]] and was also designed in the Greek revival style for the display of coins, is now used for temporary exhibitions.

The Gallery of the History of Ancient Painting adjoins the Knights' Hall and also flanks the skylight rooms. It was designed by [[Leo von Klenze]] in the [[Greek revival]] style as a prelude to the museum and features neoclassical marble sculptures by [[Antonio Canova]] and his followers. In the middle, the gallery opens to the main staircase of the New Hermitage, which served as the entrance to the museum before the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, but is now closed. The upper gallery of the staircase is adorned with twenty grey Serdobol granite columns and feature 19th-century European sculpture and Russian lapidary works.

===Dutch Golden Age and Flemish Baroque===
[[Image:Eremitage Interior4, St. Petersburg, Russia.jpg|thumb|The Rubens Room]]
The rooms and galleries along the southern facade and in the western wing of the New Hermitage are now entirely devoted to [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]] of the 17th century, including the large collections of [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and [[Rembrandt]]. They also contain several paintings by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] (Velvet period), [[Frans Snyders]] (for example, ''The Fish Market''), [[Gerard ter Borch]], [[Paulus Potter]], [[Jan van Goyen]], [[Ferdinand Bol]] and [[Gerard van Honthorst]].

==History==

===Origins: Catherine's collection===
[[Catherine the Great]] started her art collection in 1764 by purchasing paintings from [[Berlin]] merchant [[Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky]]. He assembled the collection for [[Frederick II of Prussia]], who ultimately refused to purchase it. Thus, Gotzkowsky provided 225 or 317 paintings (conflicting accounts list both numbers), mainly Flemish and Dutch, as well as others, including 90 not precisely identified, to the Russian crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norman|1997|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection consisted of [[Rembrandt]] (13 paintings), [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] (11 paintings), [[Jacob Jordaens]] (7 paintings), [[Anthony van Dyck]] (5 paintings), [[Paolo Veronese]] (5 paintings), [[Frans Hals]] (3 paintings, including ''Portrait of a Young Man with a Glove''), [[Raphael]] (2 paintings), [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]] (2 paintings), [[Titian]] (1 painting), [[Jan Steen]] (''The Idlers''), [[Hendrik Goltzius]], [[Dirck van Baburen]], [[Hendrick van Balen]] and [[Gerrit van Honthorst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frank|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps some of the most famous and notable artworks that were a part of Catherine's original purchase from Gotzkowsky were ''[[Danaë (Rembrandt painting)|Danae]]'', painted by Rembrandt in 1636; ''Descent from the Cross'', painted by Rembrandt in 1624; and ''Portrait of a Young Man Holding a Glove'', painted by Frans Hals in 1650. These paintings remain in the Hermitage collection today.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;“Hermitage History,” www.hermitagemuseum.org.{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Profile portrait of Catherine II by Fedor Rokotov (1763, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|thumb|Empress Catherine II]]

In 1764, Catherine commissioned [[Yury Felten]] to build an extension on the east of the [[Winter Palace]] which he completed in 1766. &lt;!--In the tradition of [[Peter the Great]] and [[Empress Elizabeth]], who called retreats in their residences Hermitage after [[Louis XIV]]'s [[Château de Marly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norman|1997|p=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; she too called the structure "my hermitage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norman|1997|p=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Later it became the Southern Pavilion of the Small Hermitage. In 1767–1769, French architect [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]] built the Northern Pavilion on the Neva embankment. Between 1767 and 1775, the extensions were connected by galleries, where Catherine put her collections.&lt;ref name="encspb.ru"&gt;Saint Petersburg Encyclopedia - [http://www.encspb.ru/en/article.php?kod=2804004895 Hermitage Buildings (entry)]&lt;/ref&gt; The entire neoclassical building is now known as the Small Hermitage. During the time of Catherine, the Hermitage was not a public museum and few people were allowed to view its holdings. [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]] also rebuilt rooms in the second story of the south-east corner block that was originally built for Elizabeth and later occupied by Peter III. The largest room in this particular apartment was the Audience Chamber (also called the Throne Hall) which consisted of 227 square meters.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The Hermitage buildings served as a home and workplace for nearly a thousand people, including the Imperial family. In addition to this, they also served as an extravagant showplace for all kinds of Russian relics and displays of wealth prior to the art collections. Many events were held in these buildings including masquerades for the nobility, grand receptions and ceremonies for state and government officials. The "Hermitage complex" was a creation of Catherine's that allowed all kinds of festivities to take place in the palace, the theatre and even the museum of the Hermitage. This helped solidify the Hermitage as not only a dwelling place for the Imperial family, but also as an important symbol and memorial to the imperial Russian state. Today, the palace and the museum are one and the same. In Catherine's day, the Winter Palace served as a central part of what was called the Palace Square. The Palace Square served as St. Petersburg’s nerve center by linking it to all the city's most important buildings. The presence of the Palace Square was extremely significant to the urban development of St. Petersburg, and while it became less of a nerve center later into the 20th century, its symbolic value was still very much preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky, Mikhail, “The Hermitage in the Context of the City,” Museum International 55, no. 1, 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine acquired the best collections offered for sale by the heirs of prominent collectors. In 1769, she purchased [[Heinrich von Brühl|Brühl]]'s collection, consisting of over 600 paintings and a vast number of prints and drawings, in [[Saxony]]. Three years later, she bought [[Pierre Crozat|Crozat]]'s collection of paintings in France with the assistance of [[Denis Diderot]]. Next, in 1779, she acquired [[Walpole collection|the collection of 198 paintings]] that once belonged to [[Robert Walpole]] in London followed by a collection of 119 paintings in Paris from Count Baudouin in 1781. Catherine’s favorite items to collect were believed to be engraved gems and cameos. At the inaugural exhibit of the Hermitage, opened by the Prince of Wales in November 2000, there was an entire gallery devoted to representing and displaying Catherine's favorite items. In this gallery her cameos are displayed along with cabinet made by David Roentgen, which holds her engraved gems. As the symbol of Minerva was frequently used and favored by Catherine to represent her patronage of the arts, a cameo of Catherine as Minerva is also displayed here. This particular cameo was created for her by her daughter-in-law, the Grand Duchess Maria Fyodorovna. This is only a small representation of Catherine's vast collection of many antique and contemporary engraved gems and cameos.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Mary Willan, “The Treasures of Catherine the Great from the State Hermitage Museum St. Petersburg,” Antiques &amp; Collecting Magazine 106, no. 3, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Beggrov2.jpg|thumb|''View of the Palace Embankment'' by Karl Beggrov, 1826. The Old Hermitage is in the middle of the painting.]]

The collection soon overgrew the building. In her lifetime, Catherine acquired 4,000 paintings from the old masters, 38,000 books, 10,000 engraved gems, 10,000 drawings, 16,000 coins and medals and a natural history collection filling two galleries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norman|1997|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; so in 1771 she commissioned Yury Felten to build another major extension. The neoclassical building was completed in 1787 and has come to be known as the Large Hermitage or Old Hermitage. Catherine also gave the name of the Hermitage to [[Hermitage Theatre|her private theatre]], built nearby between 1783 and 1787 by the Italian architect [[Giacomo Quarenghi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norman|1997|pp=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London in 1787, Catherine acquired the collection of sculpture that belonged to [[Lyde Browne (antiquary)|Lyde Browne]], mostly Ancient Roman marbles. Catherine used them to adorn the [[Catherine Palace]] and park in [[Tsarskoye Selo]], but later they became the core of the Classical Antiquities collection of the Hermitage. From 1787 to 1792, Quarenghi designed and built a wing along the [[Winter Canal]] with the Raphael Loggias to replicate the loggia in the [[Apostolic Palace]] in Rome designed by [[Donato Bramante]] and frescoed by Raphael.&lt;ref name="encspb.ru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_5.html |title=Hermitage History: The Raphael Loggias |website=www.hermitagemuseum.org |accessdate=7 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911063530/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_5.html |archivedate=11 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_6.html |title=Hermitage History: Timeline: 1771-1787: Construction of the Great Hermitage |website=www.hermitagemuseum.org |accessdate=7 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628061448/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_6.html |archivedate=28 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loggias in Saint Petersburg were adorned with copies of Vatican frescoes painted by [[Cristopher Unterberger]] and his workshop in the 1780s.

Catherine succeeded in accomplishing a huge achievement in the art world. She collected thousands of impressive pieces of artwork that were numerous in size and value. In her collection, at least 4,000 paintings came to rival the older and more prestigious museums of Western Europe. Catherine took great pride in her collection, and actively participated in extensive competitive art gathering and collecting that was prevalent in European royal court culture. Through Catherine’s art collection, she gained European acknowledgment and acceptance, and portrayed Russia as an enlightened society, another feat that Catherine took great pride in. Catherine went on to invest much of her identity in being a patron for the arts. She was particularly fond of the popular deity, Minerva, whose characteristics according to classical tradition are symbolic of military prowess, wisdom, and patronage of the arts. Using the title, Catherine the Minerva, she personally created new institutions of literature and culture and also participated in many projects of her own, mostly having to do with play writing. The representation of Catherine alongside Minerva would come to be a known tradition of enlightened patronage in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Dianina, Katia, “Art and Authority: The Hermitage of Catherine the Great,” Russian Review 63, no. 4, 634-636.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion in the 19th century===
[[File:Atlantes-Saint Petersburg-6.jpg|thumb|left|Portico with atlantes, historical entrance]]
In 1815, [[Alexander I of Russia]] purchased 38 pictures from the heirs of [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], most of which had been looted by the French in [[Kassel]] during the war. The Hermitage collection of Rembrandts was then considered the largest in the world. Also among Alexander's purchases from Josephine's estate were the first four sculptures by the neoclassical Italian sculptor Antonio Canova to enter the Hermitage collection.

Eventually the imperial collections were enriched by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Scythian]] artifacts excavated within the Russian Empire.

[[File:Raphael Loggias Hermitage.jpg|thumb|upright|The Raphael Loggias]]
Between 1840 and 1843, Vasily Stasov redesigned the interiors of the Southern Pavilion of the Small Hermitage. In 1838, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] commissioned the neoclassical German architect [[Leo von Klenze]] to design a building for the public museum. Space for the museum was made next to the Small Hermitage by the demolition of the Shepelev Palace and royal stables. The construction was overseen by the Russian architects [[Vasily Stasov]] and [[Nikolai Yefimov]] in 1842–1851 and incorporated Quarenghi's wing with the Raphael Loggias.

In 1851, in [[Venice]] the museum acquired the collection of [[Cristoforo Barbarigo]], including five more canvases by [[Titian]]. Today, all of the paintings but one (''[[Danaë (Titian, Hermitage)|Danaë]]'') by Titian in the Hermitage Museum came to St. Petersburg from the Barbarigo collection.

The New Hermitage was opened to the public on 5 February 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norman|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the [[Egyptian Collection of the Hermitage Museum]] emerged, and was particularly enriched by items given by the [[Maximilian de Beauharnais, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg|Duke of Leuchtenberg]], Nicholas I's son-in-law. Meanwhile, in 1851–1860, the interiors of the Old Hermitage were redesigned by [[Andrei Stackensneider]] to accommodate the State Assembly, Cabinet of Ministers and state apartments. Stakenschneider created the Pavilion Hall in the Northern Pavilion of the Small Hermitage in 1851–1858.&lt;ref name="encspb.ru"/&gt;

Until the 1920s, the museum's entrance was under the portico supported by five-metre high [[atlas (architecture)|atlantes]] of grey Serdobol granite from Finland in the middle of the southern facade of the New Hermitage building.

In 1861, the Hermitage purchased from the [[Papal government]] part of the [[Giampietro Campana]] collection, which consisted mostly classical antiquities. These included over 500 vases, 200 bronzes and a number of marble statues. The Hermitage acquired ''[[Madonna Litta]]'', which was then attributed to Leonardo, in 1865, and Raphael's ''[[Connestabile Madonna]]'' in 1870. In 1884 in Paris, [[Alexander III of Russia]] acquired the collection of [[Alexander Basilewski]], featuring European medieval and Renaissance artifacts. In 1885, the Arsenal collection of arms and armour, founded by [[Alexander I of Russia]], was transferred from the [[Catherine Palace]] in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] to the Hermitage. In 1914, Leonardo's ''[[Benois Madonna]]'' was added to the collection.

===After the October Revolution===
Immediately after the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]] of 1917 the Imperial Hermitage and Winter Palace, former Imperial residence, were proclaimed state museums and eventually merged.

[[Image:WinterPalaceRoom.jpg|thumb|left|A room in the Winter Palace]]
The range of the Hermitage's exhibits was further expanded when private art collections from several [[palace]]s of the [[Russian Tsar]]s and numerous private mansions were [[nationalization|nationalized]] and redistributed among major Soviet state museums. Particularly notable was the influx of old masters from the [[Catherine Palace]], the [[Alexander Palace]], the [[Stroganov Palace]] and the [[Moika Palace|Yusupov Palace]] as well as from other palaces of Saint Petersburg and suburbs.

In 1922, an important collection of 19th-century European paintings was transferred to the Hermitage from the [[Imperial Academy of Arts|Academy of Arts]]. In turn, in 1927 about 500 important paintings were transferred to the [[Pushkin Museum|Central Museum of old Western art]] in Moscow at the insistence of the Soviet authorities. In the early 1930s, 70 more paintings were sent there. After 1932, a number of less significant works of art were transferred to new museums all over the Soviet Union.

In 1928, the Soviet government ordered the Hermitage to compile a list of valuable works of art for export. In 1930–1934, over two thousand works of art from the Hermitage collection were clandestinely sold at auctions abroad or directly to foreign officials and businesspeople. The sold items included [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Alba Madonna]]'', [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus with a Mirror]]'', and [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]'', among other world known masterpieces by [[Botticelli]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Van Dyck]], and others. In 1931, after a series of negotiations, [[Andrew W. Mellon]] acquired 21 works of art from the Hermitage and later donated to form a nucleus of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. (see also [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings]]).

[[File:Leningrad skiers.jpg|thumb|upright|Soviet ski troops by the portico during the Siege of Leningrad]]
With the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, before the [[Siege of Leningrad]] started, two trains with a considerable part of the collections were evacuated to [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]]. Two bombs and a number of shells hit the museum buildings during the siege. The museum opened an exhibition in November 1944. In October 1945 the evacuated collections were brought back, and in November 1945 the museum reopened.

In 1948, 316 works of [[Impressionist]], [[post-Impressionist]], and [[modern art]] from the collection of the Museum of New Western Art in Moscow, originating mostly from the nationalized collections of [[Sergei Shchukin]] and [[Ivan Morozov]] and disestablished before the war, were transferred to the Hermitage, including works by [[Matisse]] and [[Picasso]]. Beginning in 1967, a number of works by Matisse were donated to the museum by his muse [[Lydia Delectorskaya]].

In 1981, the restored [[Menshikov Palace]] became a new branch of the Hermitage museum, displaying Russian culture of the early 18th century.

On 15 June 1985, a man later judged insane attacked Rembrandt's painting ''[[Danaë (Rembrandt painting)|Danaë]]'', displayed in the museum. He threw [[sulfuric acid]] on the canvas and cut it twice with his knife. The restoration of the painting had been accomplished by Hermitage experts by 1997, and ''Danaë'' is now on display behind armoured glass.

===The Hermitage since 1991===
In 1991, it became known that some paintings looted by the [[Red Army]] in Germany in 1945 were held in the Hermitage. Only in October 1994 the Hermitage officially announced that it had secretly been holding a major trove of French [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] paintings from German private collections. The exhibition "Hidden Treasures Revealed", where 74 of the paintings were displayed for the first time, was opened on 30 March 1995, in the [[Neva Enfilade of the Winter Palace#The Nicholas Hall|Nicholas Hall]] of the Winter Palace and lasted a year. Of the paintings, all but one originated from private rather than state German collections, including 56 paintings from the Otto Krebs collection, as well as the collection of Bernhard Koehler and paintings previously belonging to Otto Gerstenberg and his daughter Margarete Scharf, including world-famous ''[[Place de la Concorde (painting)|Place de la Concorde]]'' by [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], ''In the Garden'' by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], ''[[White House at Night]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]], and some other collections.&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;{{cite news| author=John Russell| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E4DD1139F937A35753C1A962958260| title=Hermitage Reveals It Hid Trove of Impressionist Art| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=4 October 1994| accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Erlanger"&gt;{{cite news| author=Steven Erlanger| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DE1538F933A05750C0A963958260| title=Restitution Hermitage, in Its Manner, Displays Its Looted Art| work=The New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| date=30 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_42.html |title=Hermitage History: Timeline: 1995: The exhibition Hidden Treasures Revealed |website=www.hermitagemuseum.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303165740/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_42.html |archivedate=3 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the paintings are now on permanent display in several small rooms in the northeastern corner of the Winter Palace on the first floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Tour: 70: Room Displaying "Unknown Masterpieces" |url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/08/hm89_0_1_70.html |work=www.hermitagemuseum.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209094541/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/08/hm89_0_1_70.html |archivedate=9 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Tour: 71: Room Displaying "Unknown Masterpieces" |url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/08/hm89_0_1_71.html |work=www.hermitagemuseum.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005013016/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/08/hm89_0_1_71.html |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the Russian government gave eastern wing of the nearby [[General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg)|General Staff Building]] across the Palace Square to the Hermitage and the new exhibition rooms in 1999. Since 2003, the [[Gardens of the Winter Palace|Great Courtyard]] of the Winter Palace has been open to the public providing another entrance to the museum. Also in 2003, the Museum of Porcelain opened as a part of the Hermitage on the basis of the [[Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg|Imperial Porcelain Factory]].

In December 2004, the museum discovered another looted work of art: ''Venus disarming Mars'' by [[Rubens]] was once in the collection of the [[Rheinsberg Palace]] in Berlin, and was apparently looted by Soviet troops from the [[Königsberg Castle]] in East Prussia in 1945. At the time, Mikhail Piotrovsky said the painting would be cleaned and displayed.&lt;ref name="rubens"&gt;{{cite news| publisher=Codart.nl| url=http://www.codart.nl/news/55/| title=St Petersburg: Rubens looted from Germany discovered at Hermitage| work=The Art Newspaper| author=John Varoli| date=20 December 2004| accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum announced in July 2006, that 221 minor items, including jewelry, Orthodox icons, silverware and richly enameled objects, had been stolen.  The value of the stolen items was estimated to be approximately $543,000 but by the end of 2006 several of the stolen items were recovered.&lt;ref name="wpost"&gt;{{cite news| title=Stolen Russian Museum Items Not Insured| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/01/AR2006080100406_pf.html| work=[[The Washington Post]]| date=1 August 2006| author=Galina Stolyarova| accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dependencies==
[[File:Placca cervo, da regione di krasnodar, kostromskaja, oro fuso e cesellato, inizio VI sec ac..JPG|thumb|Deer golden plaque from Krasnodar, beginning of 6th century BC]]
In recent years, the Hermitage launched several dependencies abroad and domestically.

===Hermitage Amsterdam===
{{main|Hermitage Amsterdam}}
The dependency of the Hermitage Museum in [[Amsterdam]] is known as the Hermitage Amsterdam, and is located in the former [[Amstelhof]] building. It opened on 24 February 2004 in a small building on the Nieuwe Herengracht in Amsterdam, awaiting the closing of the retirement home which still occupied the Amstelhof building until 2007. Between 2007 and 2009, the Amstelhof was renovated and made suitable for the housing of the Amsterdam Hermitage. The Amsterdam Hermitage was opened on 19 June 2009 by President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and Queen [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuters.com - [https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/06/18/us-dutch-hermitage-opening-idUSTRE55H6OC20090618 Russia's Hermitage museum opens Amsterdam branch]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermitage-Kazan Exhibition Center===
The Hermitage dependency in [[Kazan]] ([[Tatarstan]], Russia), opened in 2005. It was created with support from President of the Republic of Tatarstan [[Mintimer Shaimiev]] and is a subdivision of the Kazan Kremlin State Historical and Architectural Museum-Park. The museum is situated in the [[Kazan Kremlin]] in an edifice previously occupied by the Junker School built in the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/13/hm13_1_003.html |title=The Hermitage-Kazan Exhibition Center, Tatarstan |website=www.hermitagemuseum.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808054530/http://hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/13/hm13_1_003.html |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ermitage Italia, Ferrara===
Following the prior experiences in London, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Amsterdam and Kazan, the Hermitage foundation decided to create a further branch in Italy with the launch of a national bid. Several northern Italian cities expressed interest such as Verona, Mantua, Ferrara and Turin. In 2007, the honor was awarded to the city of [[Ferrara]] which proposed its [[Castello Estense|Castle Estense]] as the base. Since then, the new institution called ''Ermitage Italia'' started a research and scientific collaboration with the Hermitage foundation.&lt;ref name="ermitageit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ermitageitalia.com/home.aspx?lang=en-US |title=ErmitageItalia Homepage |website=Ermitageitalia.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316234956/http://www.ermitageitalia.com/home.aspx?lang=en-US |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volunteer service===
{{main|Hermitage Volunteer Service}}
The Hermitage Volunteer Service offers all those interested a unique opportunity to involve themselves in running this world-renowned museum. The program not only aids the Hermitage with its external and internal activities but also serves as an informal link between the museum staff and the public, bringing the specific knowledge of the museum’s experts to the community. Volunteers may also develop projects reflecting their own personal goals and interests: communicate a feeling of responsibility to the youth so as to help them understand the value of tradition and the necessity of its preservation.

===Cats===

==In popular culture==

===Films===
*''[[Russian Ark]]'' (2002), the Russian film by [[Alexander Sokurov]], was filmed entirely in the Hermitage Museum, showing the [[Winter Palace]] at various stages of its history.
*''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'' (1966–67), an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning Soviet adaptation of the novel by [[Leo Tolstoy]], was partially filmed in the [[Winter Palace]].

===Television===
‘Culture,’ a Russian national television channel, has been presenting the various art collections of the Hermitage to the general public for years. There are a series of programs that have aired entitled ‘My Hermitage’ that have been particularly successful. All of these programs are organized by the Director of the Hermitage, Professor Mikhail Piotrovsky, and are quite similar to the broadcasts created by Academician Boris Piotrovsky, who is Mikhail’s father. These programs were first broadcast through the Soviet Union’s ‘First’ channel, airing at the height of the museum’s boom. During this time, this channel recorded more than three million visitors every year, mostly from the Soviet Union. Another program created by the Hermitage was called ‘The Treasures of St. Petersburg,’ and was broadcast on the St. Petersburg regional television. This program gave insight into what exhibitions were being displayed at the Hermitage.&lt;ref&gt;Matveev, Vladimir, “The Hermitage and its Links with Regions of Russia,” Museum International 55, no. 1, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Treasures of St Petersburg &amp; The Hermitage'', (2003) a three-part documentary series for Channel 5 in the UK, directed by Graham Addicott and produced by Pille Runk. An Anglo-Estonian co-production by First Freedom Productions and Allfilm. DVD Cat No BDV057

'Hermitage Revealed' (2014) is a BBC documentary from Margy Kinmonth. The film tells the story of its journey from imperial palace to state museum, investigating remarkable tales of dedication, devotion, ownership and ultimate sacrifice, showing how the collection came about, how it survived tumultuous revolutionary times and what makes the Hermitage unique today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3830664/|title=Hermitage Revealed|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Istaz'''&lt;ref name="ObitPWT"/&gt; (August 3, 1924 – July 28, 2007) was a Belgian [[professional wrestler]] and trainer, best known by his [[ring name]] '''Karl Gotch'''. In [[Japan]], Gotch was known as the "God of Wrestling" due to his influence in shaping the [[Puroresu|Japanese professional wrestling style]].

== Early life ==
Istaz was born in [[Antwerp, Belgium]], but grew up in [[Hamburg, Germany]].&lt;ref name="PWHoF"/&gt; He learned [[Greco-Roman wrestling]] in his early years and from the beginning he was a very well known sportsman. He wrestled in "The Hippodroom", a notable sports center in Antwerp, where amateur fights like boxing matches, savate matches and wrestling matches were fought.

== Career ==

=== Amateur wrestling ===
Istaz excelled in [[amateur wrestling]] and experienced a major breakthrough in his career by competing as Charles Istaz for [[Belgium]] in the 1948 [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] in both [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling]]. Gotch also trained in the [[India]]n [[martial art]] of [[Pehlwani]]. This training led to Istaz's regime of [[Calisthenics|calisthenic]] bodyweight exercise, which were used by Indian wrestlers and other athletes to build leg endurance and strength. He also adopted other Indian exercises, such as the [[Bridge (exercise)|bridge]], [[Squat (exercise)#Bodyweight|Hindu squat]]s, and [[Push-up#Hindu push-ups|Hindu press ups]] in his wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puroresu.com/wrestlers/gotch_karl/article.html "Karl Gotch, The Quiet Man, Speaks His Piece" – December, 1968&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Gotch's philosophy was later passed on to several of his students.

=== Professional wrestling ===

==== Europe and the United States ====
Istaz's [[professional wrestling]] career began after training in the "Snake Pit", run by the renowned [[catch wrestling|catch wrestler]] [[Billy Riley]].&lt;ref name="PWHoF"/&gt; He debuted in the 1950s, wrestling throughout Europe under the [[ring name]] Karl Krauser, and winning various titles including the [[German Heavyweight Championship]] and the [[European Championship (wrestling)|European Championship]].&lt;ref name="PWHoF"/&gt;

In the late 1950s, Istaz moved to the [[United States]], and began wrestling as Karl Gotch.&lt;ref name="PWHoF"/&gt; In the United States, Gotch's wrestling style and lack of showmanship held him back, and he did not experience any great popularity at the time.&lt;ref name="Schramm"/&gt; In 1961, he won the American Wrestling Alliance (Ohio) World Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref name="PWHoF"/&gt; Gotch held the belt for two years before dropping the title to [[Lou Thesz]], one of the few American wrestlers he respected because of the similarities of their styles (the two also share a common German/Hungarian heritage). In 1962, Gotch was involved in a backstage altercation with the then-[[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|"Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers]], in which Rogers was injured.&lt;ref name="Schramm"/&gt; The incident alienated Gotch from American promoters, and he began looking for work in Japan.&lt;ref name="Schramm"/&gt;

He returned to the United States for a stint in the 1970s, with a brief run in the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] from August 1971 to February 1972. On December 6, 1971, he teamed with [[Rene Goulet]] to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWWF World Tag Team Championship]] from the inaugural champions, [[Grady Johnson|Luke Graham]] and [[Tarzan Tyler]], in two straight falls of a best-two-out-of-three-falls match in [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name="Schramm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/71.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1971 | accessdate = September 8, 2009| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = (December 6, 1971) Karl Gotch &amp; Rene Goulet defeated WWWF Tag Team Champions Luke Graham &amp; Tarzan Tyler to win the titles in a Best 2 out of 3 falls match, 2–0, at 17:20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lost the championship on February 1, 1972, to [[Mikel Scicluna|Baron Mikel Scicluna]] and [[King Curtis Iaukea|King Curtis]].&lt;ref name="Schramm"/&gt;

==== Japan ====
During the 1960s, Gotch began wrestling in other countries. He wrestled in [[Australia]] as Karl Krauser, and in 1965 he defeated [[Spiros Arion]] to win the [[World Championship Wrestling (Australia)|International Wrestling Alliance]]'s [[IWA World Heavyweight Championship (Australia)|Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name="PWHoF"/&gt; He had also begun working in [[Japan]], where he became very popular due to his amateur wrestling style.&lt;ref name="PWHoF"/&gt; He wrestled in the main event of the very first show held by [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) on March 6, 1972, defeating [[Antonio Inoki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Torch_Flashbacks_19/article_652.shtml|title=5 Yrs Ago: Zavisa on the 25th Anniversary of New Japan Pro Wrestling|date=September 15, 2002|last=Zavisa|first=Chris|accessdate=January 14, 2013|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final match occurred on January 1, 1982, when he pinned [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]] with the German Suplex.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/82.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Gotch worked as both the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Booker|booker]] and trainer for NJPW.&lt;ref name="Schramm"/&gt; He trained several wrestlers in Japan, including [[Hiro Matsuda]], [[Satoru Sayama]], [[Osamu Kido]], [[Barry Darsow]], [[Minoru Suzuki]] and [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]].&lt;ref name="PWHoF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schramm"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Istaz was married and had a daughter.&lt;ref name="Schramm"/&gt; They resided in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="Schramm"/&gt;

== Legacy and death ==
Gotch became known as "Kamisama" in Japan.&lt;ref name="Schramm"/&gt; Gotch's wrestling style had a big impact on Inoki, who adopted and popularized his submission-based style. Some of Istaz's trainees founded the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] in Japan in 1984, which showcased the [[Shoot wrestling|shoot-style]] of professional wrestling. The success of UWF and similar promotions influenced Japanese wrestling in subsequent decades, and changed the style of matches in NJPW and [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]].&lt;ref name="Schramm"/&gt;

The [[German suplex]] is named after Gotch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/five-very-european-maneuvers-for-antonio-cesaro-26058724/page-3|title=Five very European maneuvers for Antonio Cesaro|accessdate=January 14, 2013|publisher=[[WWE]]|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gotch was inducted into the [[Wrestling Observer Hall of Fame]] as part of the inaugural class in 1996.&lt;ref name="Schramm"/&gt; In 2007, he was inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="PWHoF"/&gt;

The '''La Brea Tar Pits''' are a group of [[tar pit]]s around which [[Hancock Park]] was formed in urban [[Los Angeles]]. Natural [[asphalt]] (also called asphaltum, bitumen, pitch or tar—''brea'' in Spanish) has seeped up from the ground in this area for tens of thousands of years. The tar is often covered with dust, leaves, or water. Over many centuries, the tar preserved the bones of trapped animals. The [[George C. Page]] Museum is dedicated to researching the tar pits and displaying specimens from the animals that died there. The La Brea Tar Pits are a registered [[National Natural Landmark]].

==Formation==
[[File:Smilodon and Canis dirus.jpg|thumb|Illustration of several species getting mired in the tar pits]]

Tar pits are composed of [[Heavy crude oil|heavy oil]] fractions called [[gilsonite]], which seeped from the Earth as oil. In [[Hancock Park]], [[crude oil]] seeps up along the 6th Street Fault from the [[Salt Lake Oil Field]], which underlies much of the Fairfax District north of the park.&lt;ref name="Khilyuk"&gt;{{cite book |title= Gas migration: events preceding earthquakes|last= Khilyuk|first= Leonid F.|authorlink= |author2=Chilingar, George V. |year= 2000|publisher= Gulf Professional Publishing|location= |isbn= 0-88415-430-0|pages= 389|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The oil reaches the surface and forms pools at several locations in the park, becoming asphalt as the lighter fractions of the petroleum [[biodegrade]] or evaporate.

The tar pits visible today are actually from human excavation. The lake pit was originally an asphalt mine. The other pits visible today were produced between 1913 and 1915, when over 100 pits were excavated in search of large mammal bones. Various combinations of asphaltum, dust, leaves and water have since filled in these holes. Normally, the asphalt appears in vents, hardening as it oozes out, to form stubby mounds. These can be seen in several areas of the park.
[[File:LA Brea Tar Pits famous Mammoths Drowning in Tar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|La Brea Tar Pits display of mammoths trapped in tar]]
This seepage has been happening for tens of thousands of years. From time to time, the asphalt would form a deposit thick enough to trap animals, and the surface would be covered with layers of water, dust, or leaves.  Animals would wander in, become trapped, and eventually die. Predators would enter to eat the trapped animals and also become stuck. As the bones of dead animals sink into the asphalt, it soaks into them, turning them a dark-brown or black color.  Lighter [[Fraction (chemistry)|fractions]] of petroleum evaporate from the asphalt, leaving a more solid substance, which encases the bones.  Dramatic fossils of large mammals have been extricated from the tar, but the asphalt also preserves [[microfossils]]: wood and plant remnants, rodent bones, insects, mollusks, dust, seeds, leaves, and even pollen grains. Examples of some of these are on display in the George C. Page museum. [[Radiometric dating]] of preserved wood and bones has given an age of 38,000 years for the oldest known material from the La Brea seeps. The pits still ensnare organisms today, so most of the pits are fenced to protect humans and animals.

==History==
[[Image:LaBrea-tarpits-1910.jpg|thumb|The Tar Pits in 1910; oil derricks can be seen in the background]]
The Native American [[Chumash people|Chumash]] and [[Tongva people]] living in the area built boats unlike any others in North America prior to contact by settlers. Pulling fallen Northern [[California redwood]] trunks and pieces of driftwood from the [[Santa Barbara Channel]], their ancestors learned to seal the cracks between the boards of the large wooden plank canoes by using the natural resource of tar. This innovative form of transportation allowed access up and down the coastline and to the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]]. 

The [[Portolá expedition]], a group of Spanish explorers led by [[Gaspar de Portolá]], made the first written record of the tar pits in 1769. Father [[Juan Crespí]] wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;While crossing the basin the scouts reported having seen some geysers of tar issuing from the ground like springs; it boils up molten, and the water runs to one side and the tar to the other. The scouts reported that they had come across many of these springs and had seen large swamps of them, enough, they said, to caulk many vessels. We were not so lucky ourselves as to see these tar geysers, much though we wished it; as it was some distance out of the way we were to take, the Governor [Portolá] did not want us to go past them. We christened them ''Los Volcanes de Brea'' [the Tar Volcanoes].&lt;ref name="LA okay"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.laokay.com/halac/RanchoLaBrea.htm|title=Historic Adobes of Los Angeles County|last=Kielbasa|first=John R.|publisher=[[Dorrance Publishing Co.]]|year=1998|isbn=0-8059-4172-X|location=[[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]]|contribution=Rancho La Brea}}.&lt;!-- Dorrance is a vanity press, but this book should nevertheless be considered a reliable source per the discussion at http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADavid_Eppstein&amp;diff=312694727&amp;oldid=311872021 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harrison Rogers, who accompanied [[Jedediah Smith]] on his 1826 expedition to California, was shown a piece of the solidified asphalt while at [[Mission San Gabriel]], and noted in his journal that "The Citizens of the Country make great use of it to pitch the roofs of their houses".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J. S., &amp; Brooks, G. R. (1977). ''The Southwest expedition of Jedediah S. Smith: His personal account of the journey to California, 1826–1827''. Glendale, Calif: A. H. Clark, p. 239. {{ISBN|0-8706-2123-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The La Brea Tar Pits and Hancock Park are situated within what was once the [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]] of [[Rancho La Brea]], now part of urban Los Angeles in the [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles|Miracle Mile]] district. For some years, tar-covered bones were found on the Rancho La Brea property but were not initially recognized as fossils because the ranch had lost various animals–including horses, cattle, dogs, and even camels–whose bones closely resemble several of the fossil species. The original Rancho La Brea land grant stipulated that the tar pits be open to the public for the use of the local [[Pueblo]]. Initially, they mistook the bones in the pits for the remains of [[pronghorn]] antelope (''Antilocapra americana'') or cattle that had become mired.

[[Union Oil]] geologist [[William Warren Orcutt|W. W. Orcutt]] is credited, in 1901, with first recognizing that fossilized prehistoric animal bones were preserved in pools of asphalt on the Hancock Ranch. In commemoration of Orcutt's initial discovery, paleontologists named the [[Pleistocene coyote|La Brea coyote]] (''Canis latrans orcutti'') in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laparks.org/dos/horticulture/orcuttranch.htm Orcutt Ranch Horticultural Center Rancho Sombra del Roble. Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument # 31.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary excavations of the bones started in 1913–1915.  In the 1940s and 1950s, public excitement was generated by the preparation of previously recovered large mammal bones.&lt;ref name="LATIMES 1946"&gt;{{cite news |title=Animal Bones 50,000 Years Old Found In Tar |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/415193041.html?dids=415193041:415193041&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+17%2C+1946&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=ANIMAL+BONES+50%2C000+YEARS+OLD+FOUND+IN+TAR |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |location=Los Angeles |date=June 17, 1946 |accessdate=January 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent study demonstrated the fossil vertebrate material was well preserved, with little evidence of bacterial degradation of bone protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=McMenamin, M.A.S.| year=1982 | title=Amino acid geochemistry of fossil bones from the Rancho La Brea Asphalt Deposit, California |journal=Quaternary Research | volume=18 | pages=174–83 | doi = 10.1016/0033-5894(82)90068-0 | issue=2 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were believed to be from the [[last glacial period]], believed to be about 30,000 years ago.

===Bacteria===
[[Methane]] gas escapes from the tar pits, causing bubbles that make the asphalt appear to boil. Asphalt and methane appear under surrounding buildings and require special operations for removal to prevent the weakening of building foundations. In 2007, researchers from [[University of California|UC Riverside]] discovered that the bubbles were caused by hardy forms of [[bacteria]] embedded in the natural asphalt. After consuming petroleum, the bacteria release methane. Around 200 to 300 species of bacteria were newly discovered here.&lt;ref name="LAT051407"&gt;Jia-Rui Chong, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-tarpits14may14,1,1214388,full.story?coll=la-default-underdog "Researchers learn why tar pits are bubbly"], ''Los Angeles Times'', May 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PageMuseum02.jpg|thumb|The La Brea Tar Pits Museum in Hancock Park]]
The George C. Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries, part of the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]], was built next to the tar pits in [[Hancock Park]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]]. Construction began in 1975, and the museum opened to the public in 1977.&lt;ref name="About Page Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tarpits.org/our-story/about-the-page|accessdate=January 25, 2016 |title=About the museum|author=Page Museum |work=Page Museum web site |publisher=The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the history of the fossil museum really began in 1913 when [[George Allan Hancock]], the owner of [[Rancho La Brea]], granted the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] exclusive excavation rights at the Tar Pits for two years. In those two years the Museum was able to extract 750,000 specimens at 96 sites guaranteeing that a large collection of fossils would remain consolidated and available to the community.&lt;ref name="tarpits.org"&gt;http://www.tarpits.org/our-story/about-the-page&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1924 Hancock donated 23 acres to LA County with the stipulation that the county provide for the preservation of the park and the exhibition of fossils found there.&lt;ref name="tarpits.org"/&gt;

The Museum tells the story of the tar pits and presents specimens excavated from them. Visitors can walk around the park and see the tar pits.  On the grounds of the park are life-size models of prehistoric animals in or near the tar pits.  Of more than 100 pits, only Pit 91 is still regularly excavated by researchers and can be seen at the Pit 91 viewing station. In addition to Pit 91 there is one other ongoing excavation called "Project 23".

[[File:Scientists Search Trove of Ice Age Fossils in Los Angeles.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=2:37|left|[[VOA]] report about the new discoveries in the pits]]
On February 18, 2009, George C. Page Museum formally announced the 2006 discovery of 16 fossil deposits which had been removed from the ground during the construction of an underground parking garage for the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] next to the tar pits.&lt;ref name="KCBS"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cache Of Ice Age Fossils Found Near Tar Pits |url=http://cbs2.com/local/ice.age.fossils.2.937436.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[KCBS-TV]] |location=Los Angeles |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=February 18, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220060922/http://cbs2.com/local/ice.age.fossils.2.937436.html |archivedate=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the finds are remains of a [[saber-toothed cat]], [[dire wolf|dire wolves]], [[bison]], [[horse]]s, a giant [[ground sloth]], [[turtle]]s, [[snail]]s, [[clam]]s, [[millipedes]], [[fish]], [[gopher (animal)|gophers]], and an [[American lion]].&lt;ref name="KCBS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA TIMES"&gt;{{cite news |author=Thomas H.

These fossils were packaged in boxes at the construction site and moved to a compound behind Pit 91, on Page Museum property so that construction could continue. Twenty-three large accumulations of tar and specimens were taken to the Page Museum. These deposits are worked on under the name "Project 23". As work for the public transit [[Metro Purple Line (LACMTA)|Metro Purple Line]] is [[Purple Line Extension|extended]], museum researchers know more tar pits will be uncovered, for example near the intersection of Wilshire and Curson.&lt;ref name="KCBS"/&gt; In an exploratory subway dig in 2014 on the [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles|Miracle Mile]], prehistoric objects unearthed included [[geoducks]], [[sand dollars]] and a 10-foot limb from a pine tree, of a type now found in [[central California]]'s woodlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prehistoric objects unearthed in LA subway dig|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10701936/Prehistoric-objects-unearthed-in-LA-subway-dig.html|last=Malkin|first=Bonnie|date=March 7, 2014|work=[[The Telegraph (UK)]]|publisher=AP|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
{{Further information|List of fossil species in the La Brea Tar Pits}}
[[File:La Brea Tar Pits.jpg|thumb|left|La Brea Tar Pits fauna as depicted by [[Charles R. Knight]]]]
Among the prehistoric species associated with the La Brea Tar Pits are [[Pleistocene]] [[mammoth]]s, [[dire wolf|dire wolves]], [[Arctodus|short-faced bears]], [[ground sloth]]s, and the [[State Fossil|state fossil]] of [[California]], the [[saber-toothed cat]] (''Smilodon fatalis'').

Only one human has been found, a partial skeleton of the [[La Brea Woman]]&lt;ref name="Merriam1914"&gt;{{Smallcaps|J.C. Merriam}} (1914) Preliminary report on the discovery of human remains in an asphalt deposit at Rancho La Brea, ''Science'' 40: 197–203&lt;/ref&gt; dated to approximately 10,000 [[calendar year]]s (c. 9,000 [[radiocarbon year]]s) [[before present|BP]],&lt;ref name="O'Keefeetal2009"&gt;{{Smallcaps|F.R.

Merriam]] of the [[University of California]] led much of the early work in identifying species in the early 20th century.

The park is known for producing myriad [[mammal]] [[fossil]]s dating from the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last glacial period]].  While mammal fossils generate significant interest, other fossils, including fossilized insects and plants, and even pollen grains, are also valued. These fossils help define a picture of what is thought to have been a cooler, moister climate in the Los Angeles basin during the glacial age. Among these fossils are microfossils, which are retrieved from a matrix of asphalt and sandy clay by washing with a solvent to remove the petroleum, then picking through the remains under a high-powered lens.

Tar pits around the world are unusual in accumulating more predators than prey. The reason for this is unknown, but one theory is that a large prey animal would die or become stuck in a tar pit, attracting predators across long distances. This [[predator trap]] would catch predators along with their prey. Another theory is that dire wolves and their prey may have been trapped during a hunt. Since modern [[wolves]] hunt in packs, each prey animal could take several wolves with it. The same may also hold true of the [[Smilodon fatalis|saber-toothed cat]] (''Smilodon fatalis'') known from the area.

Dr '''Lindsay Gerard Sharp''' is a museologist living near Wollongong/Gerringong in the coastal hinterland of [[New South Wales]] in Australia, working as a museum consultant and writing.

Born in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and raised in Australia, Sharp earned his doctorate in the History of Ideas (science/natural philosophy) in 1976, receiving the Clifford Norton research fellowship in the History of Science from [[Queen's College, Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} He started his museological career at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in [[London]] the same year he received his PhD, and for the next three decades, worked all over the world.

In Australia, Sharp led the team responsible for creating the [[Powerhouse Museum]] in [[Sydney]] and was its founding director&lt;ref&gt;Wade Chambers and Rachel Faggetter, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3106636 "Australia's Museum Powerhouse"], ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', Vol. 33, No. 3 (July, 1992), pp. 548–559.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp also served as Director, Entertainment and Leisure, for Merlin International Properties in Australia and the United Kingdom. He was CEO/Executive Consultant to the Earth Exchange – a regenerated tourist, environmental and educational facility in the Rocks, Sydney and Deputy Director/Senior Museum Consultant to the Milken Family Foundation, in [[Santa Monica, California]], United States. He served as President and CEO of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, from 1997 to 2000- Canada's equivalent of America's Smithsonian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideacityonline.com/presenters/lindsay-sharp Toronto IdeasCity Presenter Lindsay Sharp], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Sharp was appointed as Director of the London, UK [[National Museum of Science and Industry]] – now known as the Science Museum Group- a family of museums that include the National Railway Museum, the Science Museum and the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television [Now National Media Museum], Dana Center, 'Locomotion' Museum at Shildon and the National Collections Center in Wiltshire, UK.He was Founding Director of the Dana Center and Locomotion and helped replan the entire Science Museum Group, in all aspects, developing new strategic plans for the large and complex sites at each museum and enhancing the SMG's global electronic and educational engagement and reach. In June 2005 he was awarded the 2005 Public Promotion of Engineering Medal by the Royal Academy of Engineering &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.raeng.org.uk/news/releases/shownews.htm?NewsID=275 Royal Academy of Engineering Award for the Man behind the Science Museum]'', [[Royal Academy of Engineering]], 2 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharp's concern to draw more of the Science Museum's collection to the attention of more of the public was sustained.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Henderson, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article1940171.ece Science Museum II thinks big to liberate locked-away gems], ''[[The Times]]'', 16 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006 Dr Lindsay Sharp has consulted in Asia, Australasia and the USA, assisting cultural organizations in developing and engaging with broader audiences and becoming more sustainable -triple bottom line.

'''Mechenex Pacific Services Ltd v TCA Airconditioning (New Zealand) Ltd''' [1991] 2 NZLR 393 is a frequently cited case regarding mutual mistake.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=128-129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Mechenex were the contractors to supply a new airconditioning system for a building, for which the building plans required a system of 4 litres per second, and they contacted TCA if they could supply a 4 lps system.

TCA were unable to supply such a system, but nonetheless made a written offer to instead supply a different system rated at 5.39 liters per second, and attached to this quote were TCA's terms and conditions for this offer. Mechenex eventually accepted TCA's offer "as per TCA's quotation", and TCA manufactured and delivered the coils.

Unfortunately, Mechenex's head contractor would not accept the TCA coils due to the difference in the specifications, and as a result, Mechenex refused to pay TCA for the coils, on the basis that TCA had supplied the wrong type of coils. TCA claimed that their supply of the coils was not covered by the original offer, but by TCA's subsequent offer.

Mechenex pleaded this was a case of mutual mistake, under section 6(1)(iii) of the [[Contractual Mistakes Act 1977]].

==Held==
Mechenex's claim of mutual mistake failed, as this was a mistake of interpretation of the contract, which excluded the courts granting relief under the Contractual Mistakes Act. Hardie Boys J stated "The mistake is therefore of the same character as that of the unfortunate appellant in [[Paulger v Butland Industries Ltd]] [1989] 3 NZLR 549"

The '''Memorandum of Independence of Macedonia''' ({{lang-fr|Mémorandum consérnant l'indépendance de la Macédoine}}) is a document published on March 1, 1913 by four former members of the [[Macedonian Scientific and Literary Society]]. They insisted on the independence of the modern region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref name="ristovski"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ristovski|first=Blaže|date=1995|title=Македонија и македонската нација|trans-title=Macedonia and the Macedonian Nation|url=|language=Macedonian|location=Skopje|publisher=Detska Radost|isbn=9989-30-057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document, among other things, says:

{{quote|While fulfilling our holy duty to our homeland and accepting the motto "Macedonia for the Macedonians", we protest and we cannot remain indifferent when the allied Balkan states, our brothers of blood and faith are preparing to tear our homeland that is on the same cultural level like them and which in number of population is larger than Serbia and Greece separately.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}}}

It  contains roughly 700 recorded musical works, 800 hours of oral histories, 50,000 photographs and historical documents, an extensive collection of program notes and essays, and thousands of hours of video footage documenting recording sessions, interviews, and live performances.

== History ==

The Archive was founded in 1990 by businessman [[Lowell Milken]], with the stated mission to "document, preserve, and disseminate the vast body of music that pertains to the American Jewish experience." &lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://milkenarchive.org/about]&lt;/ref&gt;   It was originally established as the Milken Family Archive of 20th Century American Jewish Music, with composer Michael Isaacson as its Artistic Director &lt;ref name="JR"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jrep/access/436657241.html?dids=436657241:436657241&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+06%2C+2003&amp;author=Sheli+Teitelbaum&amp;pub=The+Jerusalem+Report&amp;desc=A+%2417-Million+Musical+Revival&amp;pqatl=google | title=A $17-Million Musical Revival | accessdate=2011-01-25 | author=Teitelbaum, Shell | date=2003-10-06 | publisher=Jerusalem Report | pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993,  Neil W. Levin  of the Jewish Theological Seminary became the Artistic Director&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jtsa.edu/Academics/Registrar/Academic_Bulletin/AB_Faculty.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124165756/http://jtsa.edu/Academics/Registrar/Academic_Bulletin/AB_Faculty.xml |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }} Neil W. Levin Bio&lt;/ref&gt; and the Archive became known as the Milken Archive of American Jewish music. Between 2003 and 2006, it released a series of 50 CDs on the Naxos label,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naxos.com/series/milken_archive_of_american_jewish_music.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which have sold nearly 300,000 copies. In 2005, Producer [[David Frost]] was awarded the Grammy award for Producer of the Year, Classical,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naxos.com/news/default.asp?pn=news&amp;displaymenu=naxos_news&amp;op=202&lt;/ref&gt; for five of the albums in this series.  At present, the Archive's website serves as the primary vehicle for the Archive’s music, and the access point for its other media. The material is organized into 20 thematic groups.

An '''operating agreement''' is a key document used by [[limited liability company|LLCs]] because it outlines the business' financial and functional decisions including rules, regulations and provisions. The purpose of the document is to govern the internal operations of the business in a way that suits the specific needs of the business owners. Once the document is signed by the members of the limited liability company, it acts as an official contract binding them to its terms. Many states in the United States require an LLC to have an operating agreement. LLCs operating without an operating agreement are governed by the state's default rules contained in the relevant [[statute]] and developed through state court decisions. An operating agreement is similar in function to [[by-laws|corporate by-laws]], or analogous to a [[partnership agreement]] in multi-member LLCs. In single-member LLCs, an operating agreement is a declaration of the structure that the member has chosen for the company and sometimes used to prove in court that the LLC structure is separate from that of the individual owner and thus necessary so that the owner has documentation to prove that he or she is indeed separate from the entity itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/blogs/basic-information-about-operating-agreements|title=Basic Information About Operating Agreements {{!}} The U.S. Small Business Administration {{!}} SBA.gov|website=www.sba.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states do not require operating agreements. However, an operating agreement is highly recommended for multi-member LLCs because it structures an LLC's finances and organization, and provides rules and regulations for smooth operation. The operating agreement usually includes percentage of interests, allocation of profits and losses, member's rights and responsibilities and other provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/choose-your-business-structure/limited-liability-company|title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) {{!}} The U.S. Small Business Administration {{!}} SBA.gov|website=www.sba.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Operating agreements are legally significant. Having a correctly drafted operating agreement is crucial in case legal disputes arise between business owners.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

'''Mary Ann Kostecki''' (August 11, 1934 – May 12, 2008), better known by her [[ring name]] '''Penny Banner''', was an American [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].&lt;ref name=ajc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austin360.com/movies/content/shared/movies/reviews/L/lipstickanddynamite/ajc.html|title=Lipstick &amp; Dynamite: You'll fall for these ladies|author=Eleanor Ringel Gillespie|publisher=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|accessdate= July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Best known for her time spent in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), she was also the Commissioner of the [[Professional Girl Wrestling Association]] (PGWA) from 1992 until her death.

== Early life ==
Growing up, Mary Ann Kostecki's family did not have television.&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingChats/ladies.html|title=Lipstick Dynamite, Piss Vinegar: The First Ladies of Wrestling Chat with Penny Banner, Ida May Martinez and Ella Waldek|author=Greg Oliver|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=July 14, 2008|date=April 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; She idolized [[Hank Williams Sr.]], a musician, when she was young.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

Later, Kostecki began working at a cocktail waitress in [[St. Louis]], while also acting as a nanny to three children.&lt;ref name=warn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warned.net/InterviewPennyBanner.html|title=Wrestling Interview With Penny Banner|author=E L Farrell|publisher=Warned.net|accessdate=July 14, 2008|date=October 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, [[Sam Muchnick]], president of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA), came into the lounge where she worked, and her boss told him that Banner was capable of doing two-hundred sit-ups.&lt;ref name=warn/&gt; Muchnick bet her she could not complete the task, and after she did, she began getting calls to be a [[Women's professional wrestling|female professional wrestler]].&lt;ref name=warn/&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
Kostecki began her career in professional wrestling as a way to learn how to defend herself outside of the ring.&lt;ref name=ajc/&gt; She came up with the name Penny Banner because she admired [[Charlton Heston]], who used the surname Banner in a movie, and the first name Penny was also significant to her.&lt;ref name=warn/&gt;

Banner was known for her "dirty" wrestling style, saying "boos are better than no audience reaction at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penny Banner (S)Cents Thousands|url=https://classicwrestlingarticles.wordpress.com/2013/01/27/penny-banner-scents-thousands/|website=Classic Wrestling Articles|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She held many [[Professional wrestling championship|titles]] in her career, including the [[NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship]] three times between 1956 and 1960 and the [[AWA World Women's Championship]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=warn/&gt; In 1959, a match with [[NWA World Women's Championship|NWA World Women's Champion]] [[June Byers]], which ended in a [[Professional wrestling#Draw|draw]], although Byers had consistently beat her in matches for three years prior.&lt;ref name=glorint&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glorywrestling.com/News/20040831.asp|title=Joe Rules Interviews G.L.O.R.Y. Legend Penny Banner|author=Rules, Joe|publisher=GLORY Wrestling|accessdate=2008-11-05|date=August 31, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was then [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#B|booked]] into a match with Byers in Indiana for the newly formed [[Big Time Wrestling (San Francisco)|American Wrestling Alliance]] (AWA) in August 1961, but Byers [[No-show (professional wrestling)|no-show]]ed.&lt;ref name=glorint/&gt; Instead of their scheduled match, the AWA booked a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]], which Banner won to become the first [[AWA World Women's Championship|AWA World Women's Champion]].&lt;ref name=glorint/&gt; She [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#V|vacated]] the title when she moved to North Carolina with her husband and child.&lt;ref name=glorint/&gt;

During her career, Banner had her nosed ripped up and her elbow dislocated.&lt;ref name=warn/&gt; Banner claimed that she retired in 1977 after June Byers, who owned the NWA World Women's Championship, retired because of a car accident, and that [[The Fabulous Moolah]] had cornered much of the national women's professional wrestling scene with her trainees and herself, which left Banner with nobody to wrestle in the Carolinas.&lt;ref name=glorint/&gt;&lt;ref name=warn/&gt; In her last twenty years of wrestling, Banner was only defeated twice: once by Moolah and once by [[Belle Start]], both of whom used the ropes for leverage while [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] Banner.&lt;ref name=glorint/&gt;

== After retirement ==
After retiring from the ring, Banner worked as a real-estate agent, worked in a rodeo, was the president of a local [[4H]], and began showing horses.&lt;ref name=warn/&gt; In 1990, she was diagnosed with [[emphysema]] and began swimming competitively to quit her smoking.&lt;ref name=glorint/&gt; She competed in the [[Senior Olympics]] doing swimming plus the [[shot put]] and [[discus throw]]s.&lt;ref name=glorint/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marvez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&amp;pk=PROWRESTLING12-08-12-04|title=Alex Marvez's weekly look at professional wrestling|accessdate=February 16, 2008|date=August 12, 2004|publisher=[[E.

She appeared at Slamboree 1994 with other wrestling Legends.

Banner's [[autobiography]] ''Banner Days'' was completed 2005.&lt;ref name="Marvez"/&gt; The book took her three years to write.&lt;ref name=glorint/&gt; Also in 2005, she was featured in the documentary film ''[[Lipstick &amp; Dynamite]]''.&lt;ref name=ajc/&gt; Her [[tag team]] partner [[Betty Jo Hawkins]] was Banner's best friend for thirty-three years until Hawkins died.&lt;ref name=glorint/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Banner went on five dates with [[Elvis Presley]] between 1956 and late 1958.&lt;ref name="Marvez"/&gt;&lt;ref name=warn/&gt; He also frequently saw her wrestle in Memphis.&lt;ref name=glorint/&gt; Their last date was one week before he left to join the army, and they never saw each other again.&lt;ref name=glorint/&gt; She was married to [[Johnny Weaver]] for thirty-five years before divorcing him in 1994.&lt;ref name="Marvez"/&gt; She became pregnant in 1959, giving birth to a daughter named Wendi.&lt;ref name=glorint/&gt;&lt;ref name="GLORY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glorywrestling.com/gg/PennyBanner/PB.asp|title=Penny Banner of G.L.O.R.Y. Wrestling|accessdate=February 16, 2008|publisher=G.L.O.R.Y. Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2005, Banner was diagnosed with cancer. In February 2006, the cancer had shrunk considerably after a doctor's check-up. In late 2007, Banner suffered several health crises, including [[pneumonia]], resulting in severe weight loss. She died in her sleep at the home of her daughter, Wendi, in Charlotte, North Carolina on May 12, 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4192">Out of all of the forms of love [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]] that existed in the [[Greco-Roman]] world, the two most common were [[eros]] and [[philia]]. Unlike eros, which was more commonly used by men, philia magic was utilized by women and others who were considered to be social inferiors.

Since there was an emphasis on service to the state in Greco-Roman culture, these social inferiors felt like they were doing their country a service. If a woman was capable of repairing her broken marriage and improving her husband’s interaction with the neighbors through magic, society was benefiting as a whole. Despite this protective purpose seen by women, philia spells were looked down on by men. They were a great source of anxiety because men saw them as tools used by the social inferiors to hijack power from the male-dominated hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Faraone, Christopher 1999"&gt;Faraone, Christopher. Ancient Greek Love Magic. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The use of spells ==

Through the use of spells, women were hoping to bring out the pleasant personal qualities of their significant others and make them increasingly submissive in order to strengthen their bond. The spells consisted of many objects found in the everyday life of a woman including [[narcotics]], [[amulets]], rings, knotted cords, and facial ointments.&lt;ref name="Faraone, Christopher 1999"/&gt; Although the violent and passionate images typically depicted in eros were not found in philia, it is important to remember that like eros, the ultimate purpose of philia magic was to take control of the victim.

== Wine ==

[[Wine]] was considered to be the most basic love [[potion]] by the [[Greeks]] and had to be handled with as much care as any other spell. This was because the conjurer had to gauge the effectiveness of the serving sizes. The right amount of wine would lead to [[sexual arousal]]; too much would lead to impotence. Herbal [[aphrodisiacs]] and mood enhancers such as [[oleander]], [[cyclamen]], and [[Mandragora officinarum|mandrake]] were also used in combination with wine for enhancements.&lt;ref name="Faraone, Christopher 1999"/&gt;

== Narcotics/Potions ==

The narcotics used in potions were designed to sedate men in progressive stages beginning with cheerfulness/ sexual arousal, progressing to the weakening of vitality, and finally ending with sleep. Potions were placed in one of two categories: irritants and those used to increase relaxation and affection. As with all narcotics, there was always a risk of severe harm or death being caused by accidental overdoses. The effects of the two potion categories were difficult to distinguish in small doses, but not in large amounts. Substantial doses of irritants caused cramping, pain, and insomnia while relaxants led to drowsiness and eventually a loss of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Faraone, Christopher 1999"/&gt;

== Rings/Gemstones ==

In the ''[[Cyranides]]'', a [[Greek language|Greek]] manual focusing on magical properties, there are descriptions of different gemstones that were thought to possess certain powers.&lt;br /&gt;•	[[Dendrite (crystal)|Dendrites]]= lead to the love of the gods and success in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
•	[[Sapphire]]= will result in a victory in every lawsuit brought against you.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Aerizon= effective around leaders when placed within a gold ring.

There were many cases in Greek and [[Neo-Assyrian]] cultures where social inferiors would stand before their superiors armed only with a magical stone set in a ring. They were hoping that the rings would increase their goodwill and help them build favorable relationships with the hierarchy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;

"A little ring for success and for charm ([[charis]]) and for victory… The world has nothing better than this. For when you have it with you, you will always get whatever you ask from anybody. Besides, it calms the angers (orgai) of kings and master. Wearing it, whatever you may say to anyone, you will be believed, and you will be pleasing to everybody”.&lt;ref name="Faraone, Christopher 1999"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Pulsa deNura''', '''Pulsa diNura''' or '''Pulsa Denoura''' ({{lang-arc|פולסי דנורא}} "The Lashes of Fire") is a purportedly [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] ceremony in which the [[destroying angel (Bible)|destroying angels]] are invoked to block heavenly forgiveness of the subject’s sins, causing all the curses named in the Bible to befall him resulting in his death. However, the [[Torah]] prohibits praying that something bad should happen to another person.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Rather, it offers the solution to pray that the bad in the person die and he become a righteous person. The source for this modern ritual is not to be found in [[Kabbalah]], but among the Hebrew magical manuals of antiquity, such as ''[[Sefer HaRazim]]'' ("Book of Secrets") and ''[[The Sword of Moses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dennis|first=Geoffrey W.|title=The Encyclopedia of Jewish Myth, Magic and Mysticism: Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WlDzCwAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide, Limited|isbn=978-0-7387-4814-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The origin of this phrase seems to come from the [[Babylonian Talmud]], in tractate [[Hagigah]] 15a. This page contains an [[Aggadah|Aggadic]] section concerning the heresies of [[Elisha ben Abuyah]]. An account is given of Elisha’s encounter with the angel [[Metatron]] and the subsequent erroneous course of action taken by [[Metatron]]. The seeming mistake of [[Metatron]] established him as being liable to receive a sentence of sixty ''pulse deNura'': {{lang|arc|אפקוהו למיטטרון ומחיוהו שיתין פולסי דנורא}}, "They took out Metatron and lashed him with sixty pulses of fire."

A ''pulsa denura'' is also mentioned once in the ''[[Zohar]]'' (section 3:263c, "Raya Mehemna"), one of the classic works of Kabbalah. There it is described as a heavenly punishment against a person who does not fulfill their religious obligations.  The phrase appears in a small number of other locations in the Talmud and Zohar, but not in the context of a mystical curse.

Some adherents of Kabbalah developed the idea of invoking a curse against a sinner, which they termed ''pulsa deNura''.

==Recent usage==
Accusations of the use of this curse by religious Jews against Jewish figures who have committed major transgressions has been made often over the past 50 years and quoted mostly in Israeli media. As the saying goes in Israel "you have not made it in Israeli politics until you've been cursed by the Pulsa DiNura." Early in the 20th century, [[Haredi]] Jews in [[Jerusalem]] were accused by the media of having recited the curse against the linguist [[Eliezer Ben Yehuda]]. There have been unsubstantiated media reports of the curse being recited against archaeologists and authors. Prior to the assassination of [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Yitzhak Rabin]], there were reports that the curse had been recited against him. On February 26, 2012, Tamar Yonah of IsraelNationalNews.com interviewed [[Yosef Dayan]], who with rabbinical guidance was involved in the Pulsa DiNura of [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and [[Ariel Sharon]].&lt;ref&gt;[ Today's King Of Israel?, Israel National News, February 27, 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avigdor Eskin]], a member of the [[Gush Emunim]] (bloc of the faithful) claimed to have recited the following maledictions of the Pulsa diNura on the night of October 6, 1995:
{{quote|"Angels of destruction will hit him.  He is damned wherever he goes.  His soul will instantly leave his body... and he will not survive a month.  Dark will be his path and God's angel will chase him.  A disaster he has never experienced will befall him and all curses known in the Torah will apply to him.  I deliver to you, the angels of wrath and ire, Yitzhak, the son of Rosa Rabin, that you may smother him and the specter of him, and cast him into hell, and dry up his wealth, and plague his thoughts, and scatter his mind that he may be steadily diminished until he reaches his death. Put to death the cursed Yitzhak. May he be damned, damned, damned!"{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}}}
Rabin was assassinated within the month.

In July 2005, the Israeli media, without citing sources, reported that opponents of the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza]] recited the Pulsa deNura in the old cemetery of [[Rosh Pina]], asking the "Angel of Death" to kill Israeli Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]]. Six months later Sharon suffered two strokes and was in a coma, fighting for his life, until his death on January 11, 2014. Of course, most analysts link this was due to his age (77) and obesity.

Reportedly, ten rabbis and kabalists instigated the same curse at the gravesite near Safed several months prior to the assassination of former prime minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]].

On November 7, 2006 the [[Edah HaChareidis]] said it was considering placing the curse on the organizers of the [[Pride parade]] scheduled to march in Jerusalem on November 10, 2006. [[Army Radio]] interviewed Rabbi Shmuel Papenheim, who announced, "The Rabbinical Court has held a special session and discussed placing a 'pulsa denura' on those who have had a hand in organizing the march." Papenheim, editor of the Haredi religious umbrella organization’s weekly magazine, added that the rabbis were also considering placing the curse "against the policemen who beat haredi Jews."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=115016 Eida Haredit Rabbinical Counsel Considers Curse on Parade Organizers, Israel National News, November 7, 2006]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Naftali Bennett]] received the pulsa denura.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/bennett-receives-death-curse-over-non-haredi-policies/|title=Bennett receives death curse over non-Haredi policies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''''S v Sikhipha''''' (2006), Sikhipha was convicted of [[Rape|raping]] a thirteen-year-old girl and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. On [[appeal]], Sikhipha contended on that the [[trial]] had been vitiated by various irregularities.  Among these was the contention that he had been unrepresented, and that his rights had not been properly explained to him.

The court noted that whether an irregularity resulted in an unfair trial depended on whether or not the accused had been [[Prejudice|prejudiced]].

In the present case the court held that Sikhipha had been apprised of his rights, and there was no indication that he had been prejudiced by the absence of a legal representative. There was no irregularity in this respect.

Where, however, an accused faces a charge as serious as that of rape, with a possible life sentence, he should not only be advised of his [[Right to counsel|right to a legal representative]], but encouraged to exercise it.

On the present facts, the accused had not been prejudiced. The appeal against [[Verdict|conviction]] was dismissed, although there was an appeal against sentence which was upheld: The sentence of life imprisonment was set aside and a sentence of twenty years' imprisonment imposed instead.

Colonel '''Robert Samuel McLaughlin''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|ED|CD}} (September 8, 1871 &amp;ndash; January 6, 1972) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman and philanthropist. He started the [[McLaughlin Motor Car Company]] in 1907, one of the first major automobile manufacturers in Canada, which evolved into [[General Motors Canada|General Motors of Canada]].

==Life and career==
McLaughlin was born near [[Bowmanville]] in the hamlet of [[Enniskillen, Ontario (Hamlet)|Enniskillen]], [[Ontario]], the son of [[Robert McLaughlin (industrialist)|Robert McLaughlin]] and Mary Smith.&lt;ref name=promoter&gt;"The McLaughlins - Sleighs, Buggys, Cars and Ginger Ale". ''The Clarington Promoter'', September 2016, pages 1 and 4.  by Myno Van Dyke&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, he worked for a short time in a local hardware store, then in 1887 became an apprentice in the upholstery shop of his father's company, McLaughlin Carriage Works,&lt;ref name="Nerbas2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Don Nerbas|title=Dominion of Capital: The Politics of Big Business and the Crisis of the Canadian Bourgeoisie, 1914-1947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2FZAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP129|date=28 August 2013|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-6281-0|pages=129–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had opened in 1867 and at one time was the largest manufacturer of horse-drawn buggies and sleighs in the British Empire.

In 1890, McLaughlin took a job at H. H. Babcock, an upholstery company in Watertown, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Arculus, Paul. ''Durant's Right Hand Man'', Freisen Press, 2011. page 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, McLaughlin and his brother George become junior partners in their father's company. In 1898, he married Adelaide Mowbray.&lt;ref name=promoter /&gt;

With engines from [[William C. Durant]] of [[Buick]], he produced the McLaughlin-Buick Model F, establishing The McLaughlin Motor Car Company, incorporated on November 20, 1907. In 1908, its first full year of operation, it produced 154 cars.

In 1910, he became a director of [[General Motors]]. He sold his Chevrolet company stock in 1918, becoming president of [[General Motors Canada|General Motors of Canada]], which continued to sell cars under the McLaughlin-Buick brand until 1942. He retired in 1945, but remained chairman of the board until his death. He remained on the board of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] until the early 1960s, and was coincidentally replaced by Royal Bank of Canada president [[Earle McLaughlin]], his first cousin once removed.

His older brother, chemist [[John J. McLaughlin]] (1865–1914), founded the [[Canada Dry]] company.&lt;ref name=UofToronto&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography – McLAUGHLIN, JOHN JAMES – Volume XIV (1911-1920)|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mclaughlin_john_james_14E.html|website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his brother's death in 1914, McLaughlin became president of this company briefly until it was sold around 1923.

His mansion, [[Parkwood Estate]], begun in 1916, was designed by the Toronto architectural firm of [[Darling and Pearson]]. In 1989, the Parkwood estate was officially designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] by the federal government, on the recommendation of the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=0452&amp;oqeName=Parkwood&amp;oqfName=Parkwood Parkwood]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|4300|Parkwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
McLaughlin was appointed honorary lieutenant-colonel of the [[The Ontario Regiment (RCAC)|34th Ontario Regiment]] in 1921 and held this position until 1931, at which time he was appointed honorary colonel of same unit, later designated as [[The Ontario Regiment (RCAC)]], a reserve armoured regiment based in Oshawa. Affectionately known as "Colonel Sam", McLaughlin served as honorary colonel until 1967, thereby becoming the longest continuously-serving colonel in the history of the [[Canadian Forces]].

In 1967, McLaughlin was appointed a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]].

==Philanthropy==
[[File:Parkwood Estate National Historic Site of Canada 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Parkwood Estate]] in 2007]]
In 1951, he established the McLaughlin Foundation which, from 1953 to 2003, donated nearly $200 million to the [[University of Toronto]] and other causes, including the [[McLaughlin Planetarium]] at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]].

McLaughlin was a major contributor to [[Queen's University at Kingston]], Ontario. The university's Mechanical Engineering Department is housed in McLaughlin Hall, which was his donation in 1948. McLaughlin Hall in Queen's University's [[John Deutsch]] University Centre is also named for him. His wife, Adelaide McLaughlin, was honoured in 1957 by Queen's, which named the women's residence Adelaide Hall for her.

In 1947 McLaughlin and his wife donated land for a Boy Scout camp on the outskirts of Oshawa.  The camp was named "Camp Samac".&lt;ref name=promoter /&gt;

McLaughlin donated $1 million to the 1968 library building at the [[University of Guelph]], which bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McLaughlin Library|url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/campus/map/library/|publisher=University of Guelph|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He provided partial funding to build a college at [[York University]] in Toronto. Opened in 1968, it was named McLaughlin College in his honour.

McLaughlin Hall at [[St. Andrew's College (Ontario)|St. Andrew's College]] in [[Aurora, Ontario]], which he unveiled in 1971 at age 99, is named after him in recognition of his contributions to the school.

He endowed the Regimental Foundation of The Ontario Regiment (RCAC) and quietly paid the salaries of some of the regiment's soldiers during times of severely curtailed government funding.

McLaughlin House at the [[Lester B. Pearson United World College of the Pacific]] also bears his name.

==Thoroughbred horse racing==
In his youth, McLaughlin competed in [[cycling]] and [[yachting]], and he was an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] [[show jumping]] champion at competitions in Canada and the [[United States]]. His love of horses led to the establishment of [[Parkwood Stable]], a  [[thoroughbred horse racing]] and [[horse breeding|breeding]] farm located a few miles north of Oshawa, Ontario.

McLaughlin's horses won numerous races in Canada and in the U.S.; his horses won important races including the 1942 [[Peter Pan Stakes]] at [[Belmont Park]]. A three-time winner of Canada's most prestigious race, the [[Queen's Plate]], in 1934 his future Hall of Fame [[Colt (horse)|colt]] [[Horometer]] won both the Queen's Plate and the [[Breeders' Stakes]]. In 1950, the nearly eighty-year-old McLaughlin retired from racing, selling his Parkwood Stable to [[E. P. Taylor]], under whom it would become known as [[Windfields Farm]].

A long-time director of the [[Ontario Jockey Club]], McLaughlin was inducted into [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1963 and the [[Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame]] in 1977.

'''State Library Victoria''' is the central [[library]] of the [[States and territories of Australia|state]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], located in [[Melbourne]]. It was established in 1854 as the Melbourne Public Library, making it Australia's oldest public library and one of the first free libraries in the world. The Library's vast collection includes over two million books and 350,000 photographs, manuscripts, maps and newspapers, with a special focus on material from Victoria, including the diaries of the city's founders, [[John Batman]] and [[John Pascoe Fawkner]], and the folios of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[James Cook]]. It also houses some of the original armour of [[Ned Kelly]]. The Library is located in the northern centre of the [[Melbourne central business district|central business district]], on the block bounded by [[Swanston Street, Melbourne|Swanston]], [[La Trobe Street, Melbourne|La Trobe]], [[Russell Street, Melbourne|Russell]], and [[Little Lonsdale Street, Melbourne|Little Lonsdale]] streets. 

==History==
[[File:State Library of Victoria Lithograph 1860.jpg|thumb|Watercolour depicting the Library frontage as built, with a domed Gallery and Museum behind, as proposed by Joseph Reed in 1860]]
[[File:Vic State Library Facade Pano,19.07.06 edit1.jpg|thumb|A panoramic view of the library facade, forecourt and lawns from Swanston Street]]
[[File:State Library of Victoria 3009e.JPG|thumb|Aerial view from above Swanston Street]]

In 1853, the decision to build a combined library, museum and gallery was made at the instigation of [[Governor of Victoria|Lieutenant-Governor]] [[Charles La Trobe]] and [[Mr Justice]] [[Sir Redmond Barry|Redmond Barry]], [[Queen's Counsel|Q.C.]] ([[Sir]] Redmond from 1860). A competition was held, won by the recently arrived [[architect]] [[Joseph Reed (architect)|Joseph Reed]], whose firm and its successors went on to design most of the later extensions, as well as numerous 19th-century landmarks such as the [[Melbourne Town Hall]], and the [[Royal Exhibition Building]]. 

On 3 July 1854, the recently inaugurated Governor [[Charles Hotham|Sir Charles Hotham]] laid the foundation stone of both the new library complex and the [[University of Melbourne]]. The library was the first stage opened in 1856, with a collection of 3,800 books chosen by Mr Justice Barry, the President of [[Trustee]]s. [[Augustus H. Tulk]], the first librarian, was appointed three months after the opening. The Melbourne Public Library as it was then known was one of the first free public libraries in the world, open to anyone over 14 years of age, so long as they had clean hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of the State Library of Victoria: The Basics|url=https://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/slvhistory|website=State Library Victoria|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The complex of buildings that now house the Library were built in numerous stages, housing various library spaces, art galleries and museum displays, finally filling the entire block in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of the State Library of Victoria : Timeline|url=https://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/c.php?g=245295&amp;p=1633335|publisher=State Library Victoria|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first stage was the centre of the front block, opened in 1856, with most of the front wing, along with the floor Queen's Reading Room (now Queen's Hall) complete in 1864 by Abraham Linacre&lt;ref&gt;https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/5681013/197090&lt;/ref&gt;. Other wings were built are various time, such as Barry Hall, along Little Lonsdale Street, in 1886, McCoy Hall (now the Redmond Barry reading boom), built for the Museum in 1892, Baldwin Spencer Hall facing Russell Street in 1909, and the McAllan Gallery on the LaTrobe Street side, built in 1932.

Temporary buildings were built in 1866 for the Intercolonial Exhibition of Australasia just behind the front wing, which remained in use until 1909, when work began on the library's famed Domed Reading Room, opened in 1913, designed by Bates, Peebles and Smart, the successor to Reed's firm, now known as [[Bates Smart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Library of Victoria|url=http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/812|website=Victorian Heritage Database|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the dome's skylights were covered in [[copper]] sheets  due to water leakage, creating the dim atmosphere that characterised the Library for decades. 

The [[National Gallery of Victoria]] moved to new buildings in [[St Kilda Road, Melbourne|St Kilda Road]] in 1968, and the [[Melbourne Museum]] moved to the [[Carlton Gardens, Melbourne|Carlton Gardens]] in 2000. 

The library underwent major refurbishments between 1990 and 2004, designed by architects [[Ancher Mortlock &amp; Woolley]]. The project cost approximately [[Australian dollar|A$]]200 million.  The reading room closed in 1999 to allow for renovation, when the skylights were reinstated. The renamed La Trobe Reading Room reopened in 2003.

The redevelopment included the creation of a number of exhibition spaces, some of which are used to house permanent exhibitions ''The Mirror of the World: Books and Ideas''  and ''The Changing Face of Victoria'' as well as a display from the Pictures Collection in the Cowen Gallery. As a result of the redevelopment, State Library Victoria can now be considered one of the largest exhibiting libraries in the world.

In February 2010, the southern wing of the library on Little Lonsdale Street was reopened as the [[Wheeler Centre]], part of Melbourne's [[city of literature]] initiative.

In 2015 the Library embarked on a five-year, $88.1 million [https://www.slv.vic.gov.au/about-us/history-vision/vision-2020-redevelopment redevelopment project, Vision 2020,] to transform its public spaces, programs and facilities to better meet the changing needs of the community. On 29 April 2015 the Minister for Creative Industries [[Martin Foley (politician)|Martin Foley]] announced that the 2015&amp;ndash;16 State Budget would provide $55.4 million towards the redevelopment of State Library Victoria, including the restoration of the Queen’s Hall, the creation of a rooftop garden terrace, a dedicated children’s and youth space, and the opening up 40 percent more of the building to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State Library of Victoria to receive $83 million facelift|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-29/state-library-of-victoria-to-receive-83-million-facelift/6431042|accessdate=5 November 2017|agency=ABC news|date=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2017, the library's contribution of $27 million from donations was eventually raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Read-y or not, State Library of Victoria transformation to start|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/ready-or-not-state-library-of-victoria-transformation-to-start-after-27m-raised-20170903-gy9vuj.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|agency=The Age|date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, the main Swanston Street entrance is temporarily closed and replaced by the newly refurbished Russell Street and La Trobe Street entrances.[https://vision2020.slv.vic.gov.au/service-alerts/#swanston-street-entrance-closure]

==Forecourt ==
[[File:State Library of Victoria - left side.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A view of the library from the left side facing Swanston Street]]
The grassy lawn in front of the library's grand entrance on Swanston Street is a popular lunch-spot for the city's workers and students at the adjacent [[RMIT University]]. Originally enclosed by a picket fence, then by a [[wrought iron]] fence and gates in the 1870s, the space was opened up with the removal of the fence and the creation of diagonal paths in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forecourt|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/slvhistory/forecourt|website=The history of the State Library of Victoria|publisher=State Library of Victoria|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forecourt includes a number of statues. A pair of [[bronze]] lions flanked the entry from the 1860s until they were removed in 1937 due to deterioration. A memorial statue of [[Mr Justice]] [[Sir Redmond Barry]], [[Queen's Counsel|Q.C.]], by [[James Gilbert (sculptor)|James Gilbert]] and built by [[Percival Ball]] was installed on the central landing of the main stairs in 1887. Flanking the entrance plaza are [[Saint George and the Dragon]], by the [[England|English]] [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Joseph Edgar Boehm|Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm]], installed in 1889 and [[Jeanne d'Arc]] (Joan of Arc), a replica of the statue by [[France|French]] sculptor [[Emmanuel Frémiet]], installed in 1907. WW1 commemorative statues ‘Wipers’ and ‘The Driver’ were at the centre points of the 1939 diagonal paths were relocated to the ground of the [[Shrine of Remembrance]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Driver &amp; Wipers Memorial|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/conflict/ww1/display/95571-driver-and-wipers-memorial|website=Monument Australia|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of [[Charles La Trobe]], by [[Australian]] sculptor Peter Corlett,  was installed in 2006 in the north east corner of the lawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of the State Library of Victoria|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/slvhistory/statuesmurals|website=Statues and Murals|publisher=State Library of Victoria|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sundays between 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm and 5:30&amp;nbsp;pm, a speakers' forum takes place on the library forecourt, where orators take turns in speaking on various subjects, and it is popular location for protest meetings and a rallying point for marches.

==Reading Rooms==

===The Dome===
[[File:State Library of Victoria La Trobe Reading room 5th floor view.jpg|thumb|220px|The La Trobe Reading Room]]
The landmark Domed Reading Room was opened in 1913, and was designed by Norman G. Peebles of [[Bates Peebles &amp; Smart|Bates Smart]]. Its [[octagon]]al space was designed to hold over a million books and up to 600 readers. It is 34.75 m in both diameter and height, and its [[oculus]] is nearly 5 m wide. The dome was the largest  in the world on completion.&lt;ref name=Lewis2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Miles|title=The Dome|journal=The Latrobe Journal|date=Spring 2003|volume=72|page=58|url=http://latrobejournal.slv.vic.gov.au/latrobejournal/issue/latrobe-72/t1-g-t6.html

|archivedate=2015-03-24 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It was superseded within months by the far larger, 69m diameter, [[Centennial Hall]] in what was then Breslau, Germany, now Wroclaw, Poland&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, it was officially renamed the LaTrobe Reading Room, and now houses the Library's Australiana collection, previously in the 1965 La Trobe Building annex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dome|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/slvhistory/dome|website=The history of the State Library of Victoria|publisher=State Library of Victoria|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chess Reading Room===
The library has a chess room that houses a wide range of materials dedicated to the history, study and practice of [[chess]]. It contains a collection of items from the Anderson Chess Collection, one of the three largest public chess collections in the world. In addition to bookshelves containing an extensive range of books and periodicals relating to chess, the room has game tables with [[chessboard]]s and pieces, and a few glass cabinets containing historical chess paraphernalia. The room is a multi-purpose room intended also for reading and studying. The Chess Room was temporarily closed in February 2017.

'''State terrorism''' refers to acts of [[terrorism]] conducted by a [[State (polity)|state]] against foreign targets or against its own [[citizen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aust, Anthony|title=Handbook of International Law|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-521-13349-4|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74Zmct-7hGIC&amp;pg=PA265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selden &amp; So, 2003: [https://books.google.com/books?id=D0icvm2EQLIC&amp;pg=PA4 p. 4.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin, 2006: p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shanahan, Timothy|title=The provisional Irish Republican Army and the morality of terrorism|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7486-3530-6|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBRhmBsVrHMC&amp;pg=PA195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
{{See also|Definition of terrorism|Terrorism}}

There is neither an academic nor an international legal consensus regarding the proper definition of the word "terrorism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Williamson, Myra|title=Terrorism, war and international law: the legality of the use of force against Afghanistan in 2001|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-7403-0|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wH3eCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schmid, Alex P.|chapter=The Definition of Terrorism|title=The Routledge Handbook of Terrorism Research|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=0-203-82873-9|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PXpFxKRsHgC&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that the actions of governments can be labelled "terrorism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= Nairn | first1= Tom | last2= James | first2= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Global Matrix: Nationalism, Globalism and State-Terrorism | url= https://www.academia.edu/1642325/Global_Matrix_Nationalism_Globalism_and_Terrorism_author_with_Tom_Nairn_Pluto_Press_London_2005 | year= 2005 | publisher= Pluto Press | location= London and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, using the term 'terrorism' to mean violent action used with the predominant intention of causing terror, [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and [[Jonathan Friedman]] distinguish between state terrorism against [[non-combatant]]s and state terrorism against [[combatant]]s, including '[[Shock and Awe]]' tactics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shock and Awe" as a subcategory of "rapid dominance" is the name given to massive intervention designed to strike terror into the minds of the enemy. It is a form of state-terrorism. The concept was however developed long before the Second Gulf War by Harlan Ullman as chair of a forum of retired military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2006 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Friedman | first2= Jonathan | title= Globalization and Violence, Vol. 3: Globalizing War and Intervention | url= https://www.academia.edu/3587732/Globalization_and_Violence_Vol._3_Globalizing_War_and_Intervention_editor_with_Jonathan_Friedman_Sage_Publications_London_2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London |page= xxx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, others, including governments, international organisations, private institutions and scholars, believe that the term is only applicable to the actions of [[violent non-state actor]]s. Historically, the term terrorism was used to refer to actions taken by governments against their own citizens whereas now it is more often perceived as targeting of non-combatants as part of a strategy directed ''against'' governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Williamson, Myra|title=Terrorism, war and international law: the legality of the use of force against Afghanistan in 2001|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-7403-0|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wH3eCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Henry Commager]] wrote that "Even when definitions of terrorism allow for ''state terrorism'', state actions in this area tend to be seen through the prism of war or national self-defense, not terror."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hor, Michael Yew Meng|title=Global anti-terrorism law and policy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-10870-6|page=20|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=nzQOAR5rqvcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; While states may accuse other states of [[state-sponsored terrorism]] when they support insurgencies, individuals who accuse their governments of terrorism are seen as radicals, because actions by legitimate governments are not generally seen as illegitimate. Academic writing tends to follow the definitions accepted by states.&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Most states use the term "terrorism" for non-state actors only.&lt;ref name="Schmid"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex P. Schmid|title=Routledge Handbook of Terrorism Research|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=0-415-41157-2|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PXpFxKRsHgC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] defines terrorism generally as "the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective", and states that "terrorism is not legally defined in all jurisdictions." The encyclopedia adds that "[e]stablishment terrorism, often called state or state-sponsored terrorism, is employed by governments – or more often by factions within governments – against that government's citizens, against factions within the government, or against foreign governments or groups."&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wip.britannica.com/eb/article-217762/terrorism |title=Terrorism|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the most common modern usage of the word terrorism refers to civilian-victimising political violence by [[Insurgency|insurgent]]s or conspirators,&lt;ref&gt;"Dealing with Terrorism", by Helen Purkitt, in Conflict in World Society, 1984, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; several scholars make a broader interpretation of the nature of terrorism that encompasses the concepts of state terrorism and state-sponsored terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Stohl, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Stohl]] argues, "The use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;''The Superpowers and International Terror'' Michael Stohl, Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the International Studies Association, Atlanta, March 27-April 1, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Stohl clarifies, however, that "[n]ot all acts of state violence are terrorism. It is important to understand that in terrorism the violence threatened or perpetrated, has purposes broader than simple physical harm to a victim. The audience of the act or threat of violence is more important than the immediate victim."&lt;ref&gt;Stohl, National Interests and State Terrorism, The Politics of Terrorism, Marcel Dekker 1988, p.275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[C. Augustus Martin|Gus Martin]] describes state terrorism as terrorism "committed by governments and quasi-governmental agencies and personnel against perceived threats", which can be directed against both domestic and foreign targets.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] defines state terrorism as "terrorism practised by states (or governments) and their agents and allies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chomsky, Noam|title=What Anthropologists Should Know about the Concept of Terrorism'|work=Anthropology Today|date=April 2002|volume=18|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeffrey A. Sluka]] has described Noam Chomsky and [[Edward S. Herman]] as pioneers in academic studies about state terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Sluka, 2000: p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stohl and [[George A. Lopez]] have designated three categories of state terrorism, based on the openness/secrecy with which the alleged terrorist acts are performed, and whether states directly perform the acts, support them, or acquiesce in them.&lt;ref&gt;Stohl &amp; Lopez, 1988: pp. 207-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Aristotle]] wrote critically of [[terror]] employed by [[tyrant]]s against their subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.762/article_detail.asp "Those Hell-Hounds Called Terrorists"] By Harvey C. Mansfield, ''The Claremont Institute'', posted November 28, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of the word ''terrorism'' identified by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is a 1795 reference to tyrannical state behavior, the "[[Reign of Terror|reign of terrorism]]" in France.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd Edition, CD Version 3, 2002, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, [[Edmund Burke]] famously decried the "thousands of those hell-hounds called terrorists" who he believed threatened Europe.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; During the [[Reign of Terror]], the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] government and other factions of the [[French Revolution]] used the apparatus of the state to kill and intimidate political opponents, and the Oxford English Dictionary includes as one definition of terrorism "Government by intimidation carried out by the party in power in France between 1789-1794".&lt;ref name="teichman"&gt;{{cite journal|title=How to define terrorism|author=Teichman, Jenny|journal=Philosophy|volume=64|issue=250|date=October 1989|pages=505–517|doi=10.1017/S0031819100044260}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original general meaning of terrorism was of terrorism by the state, as reflected in the 1798 supplement of the Dictionnaire of the [[Académie française]], which described terrorism as ''systeme'', ''regime de la terreur''.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;A History of Terrorism, by Walter Laqueur, Transaction Publishers, 2007, {{ISBN|0-7658-0799-8}}, at [https://books.google.com/books?id=RlqQHKpLfL8C], p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Myra Williamson wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The meaning of 'terrorism' has undergone a transformation. During the Reign of Terror, a regime or system of terrorism was used as an instrument of governance, wielded by a recently established revolutionary ''state'' against the enemies of the people. Now the term 'terrorism' is commonly used to describe terrorist acts committed by ''non-state or sub - national entities'' against a state. (italics in original)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Williamson, Myra|title=Terrorism, war and international law: the legality of the use of force against Afghanistan in 2001|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-7403-0|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wH3eCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later examples of state terrorism include the [[police state]] measures employed by the Soviet Union beginning in the 1930s, and by Germany's [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Primoratz, Igor (2007); [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/terrorism/ "Terrorism"] in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Igor Primoratz, "Both [the Nazis and Soviets] sought to impose total political control on society. Such a radical aim could only be pursued by a similarly radical method: by terrorism directed by an extremely powerful political police at an atomized and defenseless population. Its success was due largely to its arbitrary character — to the unpredictability of its choice of victims. In both countries, the regime first suppressed all opposition; when it no longer had any opposition to speak of, political police took to persecuting "potential" and "objective opponents". In the Soviet Union, it was eventually unleashed on victims chosen at random."&lt;ref&gt;Primoratz, Igor (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Military actions primarily directed against non-combatant targets have also been referred to as state terrorism. For example, the [[bombing of Guernica]] has been called an act of terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;What's wrong with terrorism? by Robert E. Goodin, Polity, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7456-3497-4}}, at [https://books.google.com/books?id=pV0oUUmuNfIC], p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|surprise attack on Pearl Harbor]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Other examples of state terrorism may include the World War II bombings of [[The Blitz|London]], [[Bombing of Dresden|Dresden]], [[Bombing of Chongqing|Chongqing]], and [[Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima|Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Stohl, "The Superpowers and International Terror", Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the International Studies Association, Atlanta, March 27-April 1, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

An act of sabotage, sometimes regarded as an act of terrorism, was the peace-time [[sinking of the Rainbow Warrior]], a ship owned by [[Greenpeace]], which occurred while in port at [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] on July 10, 1985. The bomb detonation killed [[Fernando Pereira]], a Dutch photographer. The organisation who committed the attack, the [[DGSE]], is a branch of [[France]]'s intelligence services. The agents responsible pleaded guilty to [[manslaughter]] as part of a plea deal and were sentenced to ten years in prison, but were secretly released early to France under an agreement between the two countries' governments.

[[Shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland|Another example]] is the British [[Military Reaction Force]] in Northern Ireland during the 1970s, which murdered innocent civilians from the Catholic community in order to stir up ethnic hatred and "take the heat off the army".&lt;ref name=murray44-45&gt;Murray, Raymond. ''The SAS in Ireland''. Mercier Press, 1990. pp.44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012–13, a former MRF member using the covername 'Simon Cursey' gave a number of interviews and published the book MRF Shadow Troop, about his time in the unit: "We opened fire at any small group in hard areas [...] armed or not – it didn't matter. We targeted specific groups that were always up to no good. These types were sympathisers and supporters, assisting the IRA movement. As far as we were concerned they were guilty by association and party to terrorist activities, leaving themselves wide open to the ultimate punishment from us".&lt;ref name=dailymail2012&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2252237/The-murder-mayhem-squad-Shocking-new-revelations-undercover-soldier-carried-shoot-ask-questions-later-attacks-IRA-terrorists-British-Army.html?ito=feeds-newsxml "The 'murder and mayhem' squad: Shocking new revelations by former undercover soldier who carried out 'shoot first, ask questions later' attacks on IRA terrorists for the British Army"].

In November 2013, a BBC Panorama documentary was aired about the MRF. It drew on information from seven former members, as well as a number of other sources. Soldier H said: "We operated initially with them thinking that we were the [[Ulster Volunteer Force|UVF]]". Soldier F added: "We wanted to cause confusion".&lt;ref name=ware&gt;Ware, John.

In June 2014, in the wake of the Panorama programme, the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) opened an investigation into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Police investigate Military Reaction Force allegations |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-27785433|newspaper=BBCl|location= |date=10 June 2014 |access-date=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an earlier review of the programme, the position of the PSNI was that none of the statements by soldiers in the programme could be taken as an admission of criminality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Panorama MRF programme: Soldiers 'admitted no crimes'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-27389349|newspaper=BBC|location= |date=13 May 2014 |access-date=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
The [[sinking of the Rainbow Warrior]] took place in [[New Zealand]]'s [[Auckland Harbour]] on July 10, 1985. It was an attack carried out by French [[DGSE]] agents Captain [[Dominique Prieur]] and Commander [[Alain Mafart]] aimed at sinking the flagship craft of the [[Greenpeace]] Organisation to stop her from interfering in [[French nuclear testing in the South Pacific]]. The attack resulted in the death of Greenpeace photographer [[Fernando Pereira]] and led to a huge uproar over the first ever attack on New Zealand sovereignty. [[France]] initially denied any involvement, and even joined in condemnation of it as a [[definition of terrorism|terrorist act]]. In July 1986, a United Nations-sponsored mediation between New Zealand and France resulted in the transfer of the two prisoners to the French Polynesian island of [[Hao (French Polynesia)|Hao]], to serve three years there, as well as an apology and a NZD 13 million payment from France to New Zealand.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Ruth J Blakeley, Professor of Politics and International Relations at the [[University of Sheffield]], accuses the United States of sponsoring and deploying state terrorism, which she defines as "the illegal targeting of individuals that the state has a duty to protect in order to instill fear in a target audience beyond the direct victim", on an "enormous scale" during the [[Cold War]]. The justification given for this was to contain Communism, but Blakeley says it was also a means by which to buttress and promote the interests of US elites and multinational corporations. The US supported [[death squads]] throughout Latin America, and US counterinsurgency training for right-wing military forces included advocacy of interrogation and torture of suspected insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeley, Ruth (2009).

Patrice McSherry]], a professor of political science at [[Long Island University]], states that "hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans were tortured, abducted or killed by right-wing military regimes as part of the US-led anti-communist crusade," which included US support for [[Operation Condor]] and the Guatemalan military during the [[Guatemalan Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McSherry|first1=J.

Declassified documents from the US Embassy in Jakarta in 2017 confirm that the US directly facilitated and encouraged the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66|mass murder of hundreds of thousands of suspected Communists in Indonesia during the mid-1960s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indonesiaatmelbourne.unimelb.edu.au/telegrams-confirm-scale-of-us-complicity-in-1965-genocide/|title=Telegrams confirm scale of US complicity in 1965 genocide|last= Melvin|first=Jess|date=20 October 2017|website=Indonesia at Melbourne|publisher=[[University of Melbourne]]|access-date=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Scott|first=Margaret|date=October 26, 2017|title=Uncovering Indonesia's Act of Killing|url=https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/10/20/uncovering-indonesias-act-of-killing/|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|location= |access-date=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradley Simpson, Director of the Indonesia/East Timor Documentation Project at the [[National Security Archive]], says "Washington did everything in its power to encourage and facilitate the army-led massacre of alleged PKI members, and U.S. officials worried only that the killing of the party's unarmed supporters might not go far enough, permitting Sukarno to return to power and frustrate the [Johnson] Administration's emerging plans for a post-Sukarno Indonesia."&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Bradley.

==Arguments against definition==
Discussions of terrorism in social sciences and philosophy tend to apply to [[violent non-state actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.unimelb.edu.au/archive/00000137/01/Primorat.pdf |title=State terrorism and counterterrorism |accessdate=2009-03-25 |format=pdf |work=Primoratz, Igor (2002) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512021205/https://eprints.unimelb.edu.au/archive/00000137/01/Primorat.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has stated that the twelve previous international conventions on terrorism had never referred to state terrorism, which was not an international legal concept, and that when states abuse their powers they should be judged against international conventions dealing with [[war crimes]], [[international human rights law]], and [[international humanitarian law]], rather than against international anti-terrorism statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2002/SC7276.doc.htm |title=Addressing Security Council, Secretary-General Calls On Counter-Terrorism Committee To Develop Long-Term Strategy To Defeat Terror |accessdate=2009-03-25 |work=United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar vein, [[Kofi Annan]], at the time [[United Nations Secretary-General]], stated that it is "time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism'. The [[use of force by states]] is already regulated under international law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newamerica.net/publications/articles/2005/the_legal_debate_is_over_terrorism_is_a_war_crime |title=The Legal Debate is Over: Terrorism is a War Crime |accessdate=2009-03-25 |format= |work=Michael Lind, [[New America Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Annan added, "...regardless of the differences between governments on the question of definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is any deliberate attack on innocent civilians [or non-combatants], regardless of one's cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/News/dh/latest/afghan/sg-teheran26.htm |title=Press conference with Kofi Annan and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi |accessdate=2009-03-25 |work=[[United Nations]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Hoffman|Dr. Bruce Hoffman]] has argued that failing to differentiate between state and non-state violence ignores the fact that there is a "fundamental qualitative difference between the two types of violence." Hoffman argues that even in war, there are rules and accepted norms of behaviour that prohibit certain types of weapons and tactics and outlaw attacks on specific categories of targets. For instance, rules codified in the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva]] and [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] on warfare prohibit taking [[civilians]] as [[hostage]]s, outlaw [[reprisals]] against either civilians or [[POWs]], recognise [[neutral territory]], etc. Hoffman states that "even the most cursory review of terrorist tactics and targets over the past quarter century reveals that terrorists have violated all these rules." Hoffman also states that when states transgress these rules of war "the term "war crime" is used to describe such acts."&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Hoffman|title=Inside Terrorism|publisher=: Columbia University Press (April 15, 1998)|year=1998|isbn=0-231-11468-0|pages=34–35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hi373pv1eLsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Laqueur]] has stated that those who argue that state terrorism should be included in studies of terrorism ignore the fact that "The very existence of a [[sovereign state|state]] is based on its [[Monopoly on force|monopoly of power]]. If it were different, states would not have the right, nor be in a position, to maintain that minimum of order on which all civilized life rests."&lt;ref name="Blakeley"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruth Blakeley|title=State terrorism and neoliberalism|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=0-415-46240-1|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FoxuDCMmlqoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling the concept a "[[red herring]]" he stated: "This argument has been used by the terrorists themselves, arguing that there is no difference between their activities and those by governments and states. It has also been employed by some sympathizers, and rests on the deliberate obfuscation between all kinds of violence..."&lt;ref name="Laqueur"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Laqueur|title=No end to war: terrorism in the twenty-first century|publisher=Continuum |year=2003|isbn=0-8264-1435-4|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uXn6UYh9JUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cartoon History of the Universe''''' is a book [[book series|series]] about the history of the world. It is written and illustrated by American [[cartoonist]], professor, and mathematician [[Larry Gonick]], who started the project in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gravet, "1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die", Universe, 2011, page 393.&lt;/ref&gt; Each book in the series explains a period of world history in a loosely [[chronological]] order. Though originally [[publishing|published]] as a [[comic book]] series, the series is now published in [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] volumes of several hundred pages each. The final volume covers history from the late 18th century to early 2008. The final two volumes, published in 2007 and 2009, are named ''The Cartoon History of the Modern World'' volumes one and two. The books have been translated into many languages, including [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Polish language|Polish]].

== Publication history ==
San Francisco-based [[underground comix]] publisher [[Rip Off Press]] began publishing ''The Cartoon History of the Universe'' in 1978, with the first six issues being published by 1981. Rip Off Press published 9 issues from 1978 to 1992; the first collected edition was published by [[Broadway Books]] in 1990.

While seeking a book publisher, Gonick received early support from [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], who worked as an editor at [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and championed ''The Cartoon History of the Universe'''s publication.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Illustration style ==
''The Cartoon History'' is illustrated in a [[black-and-white]] [[cartoon]] style. Gonick occasionally uses [[crosshatching]] and other [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] drawing techniques, but he primarily draws with a lively brush-and-ink squiggle that resembles [[Bill Watterson]]'s ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'', [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'', and [[René Goscinny]] and [[Albert Uderzo]]'s ''[[Astérix]]''. Occasionally, as in the sequences on India in the second book, he mimics [[Gilbert Shelton]]'s style from ''[[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]''. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

His tribute to ''Asterix'' is explicit. When [[Gauls]] are depicted, not only do they often resemble Goscinny and Uderzo's characters [[Asterix]] and [[Obelix]], but when Gonick treats the Gallic invasion of Italy (390 – 387 BCE), the characters, along with [[Vitalstatistix]], appear unmistakably (Vitalstatistix is transported on a shield, Asterix pummels a Roman soldier, etc.); and as they trudge off into the sunset, the speech balloon reads "Come on, Asterix! Let's get our own comic book."&lt;ref&gt;The Cartoon History of the Universe II, Pages 172–3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narrative framework ==
Each volume or [[chapter (books)|chapter]] begins with a one- or two-[[Panel (comic strips)|panel]] [[Introduction (essay)|introduction]]. An [[Albert Einstein in popular culture|Einstein]]-like Professor (representing Gonick's [[Writer's Voice|authorial voice]]) prepares to travel in his [[Time travel|time machine]] to whatever place or era the chapter is about.  The Professor reads a passage from a historical book, which activates the "time machine," a [[literary device]]. For example, the Professor reads a book about dinosaurs to introduce Volume 1 about prehistory. He reads from [[Hans Zinsser]]'s ''Rats, Lice and History'' before Volume 19 about the [[Black Death]]. This introduction provides a bridge to the action, the main narrative of each chapter.

== Narrative style and tone ==

=== Point of view ===
Any history book has a [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]], and Larry Gonick's might best be described as "[[Humanistic|humanist]]." However, it is not written in the style of a didactic [[textbook]]. Instead, Gonick fleshes out history into a long yarn, injecting characterization into historical personages, continually reporting gory anecdotes, and focusing on quirky details—all backed up by research—to enliven his subject. He reports both the greatness of human achievement and acknowledges humanity's savagery.
[[Image:Cartoon History excerpt.jpg|thumb|right|247px|Excerpt from ''The Cartoon History of the Universe II''. Note the antic [[characterization]] of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Larry Gonick|Gonick's]] use of black ink.]]
In addition to being a straight (though unusual) history, ''The Cartoon History'' helps readers understand historical [[Causality|cause and effect]]—how the past relates to the present. It explains the motivations behind human beings' [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]], [[invention]]s, explorations, wars, triumphs, and mistakes. Gonick's editorial aim seeks to do justice to every point of view.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

=== Humor ===
Gonick consistently uses elements of satire to find the most humor in every situation. For example, one [[Panel (comic strips)|cartoon panel]] depicts the [[barbarian|barbarism]] of a group of [[Huns]] who had elephants herded off a cliff for their [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] enjoyment. One Hun exclaims with an oafish grin, "My emotions are valid!"—juxtaposing the Hun's brutal barbarism with an [[anachronistic]], [[post-modern]] view of his own cruelty [3].

Also noteworthy is Gonick's use of [[caricature]]. For example, he depicts the weaselly [[Robert Guiscard]], the 11th-century [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer, as an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[weasel]], an [[allusion]] to Guiscard's name and cunning nature, and depicts [[Babur]], the 16th-century founder of the [[Mughal Empire]] with [[malocclusion|buckteeth]] (an allusion to the theory that the conqueror's name means "[[beaver]]").

== Unorthodox citations ==
Consistently enthusiastic in tone, Gonick uses each collection's [[bibliography]] to promote historical [[literacy]]. At the end of each published collection, Gonick thoroughly [[Citation|cites]] his sources. But rather than relying upon an ordinary, [[typeset]] bibliography, Gonick sustains his unorthodox style and exuberant tone as the Professor takes the reader through a cartoon tour of his sources.

Because much of ''The Cartoon History'' covers [[evolution|evolutionary science]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], and [[ancient history]], Gonick has referenced original writings on these subjects, rather than relying on secondary sources or anthologies. Some of these [[primary source]]s are national epics, cultural writings, or [[religious text|holy scriptures]], such as [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]], the [[Rig Veda]] of India, and the Bible. In this way he prompts his readers also to read the primary sources.

== Antecedents ==
Gonick's work is not the first comic history in English: an early series of comic histories was published in Victorian England: ''Comic History of England'' (1847–48) and ''Comic History of Rome'' (1852), by author [[Gilbert Abbott à Beckett]], illustrator [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]].

==The series==
Beginning with its original comic book ''Volume 1'' in 1977, the complete series covers world history through 2008.

'''''The Hanging on Union Square: An American Epic''''' is a [[1935 in literature|1935]] novel by [[Chinese American literature|Chinese American author]] H.T. Tsiang. The first edition of ''The Hanging on Union Square'' was self-published in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hsu|first1=Hua|title=Introduction: Thanks But No Thanks But Thanks|date=2013|publisher=Kaya Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is about a man called "Mr. Nut" who sits in a cafeteria, and listens to the problems of the people around him. Mr. Nut himself is unemployed, however feels as though his condition is temporary and dreams of striking it rich. Throughout the story, the reader sees Mr. Nut transforming into a radical activist. The book shows multiple facets of the social strata within the streets of Greenwich Village. The first edition was self-published in 1935, after being rejected from numerous publishers. Tsiang places numerous rejection letters in the opening pages of the novel. True to Tsiang’s radical aesthetic, the original copy does not show the title of the book, instead questioning what a book cover really is: “the cover of a book / is more of a book / than the book is a book.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The cover of a book / is more of a book / than the book is a book|url=http://kaya.com/2013/06/the-cover-of-a-book-is-more-than-a-book-than-the-book-is-a-book/|website=Kaya Press|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in 2013 by Kaya Press, and edited by Floyd Cheung.

==Background==

Hsi Tseng Tsiang (H.T. Tsiang) was born near Shanghai in 1899, and died decades later in 1971 in Los Angeles, CA. Tsiang is known as a poet, playwright, and novelist. In 1917, Tsiang is inspired by the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] led by [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladmir Lenin]], and in 1926 attempts to migrate to the Soviet Union. After the failed migration, he enters the United States as a student, and enrolled at Stanford University. '.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tsiang|first1=H.T.|title=The Hanging on Union Square|date=2013|publisher=Kaya Press|pages=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved with the Greenwich Village literary scene in the 1920s and 1930s, and self-published a number of books which he would hawk at downtown political meetings.&lt;ref name=Kaya&gt;{{cite web|title=H.T. Tsiang|url=http://kaya.com/authors/h-t-tsiang/|website=Kaya Press|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; H.T. Tsiang is also known for writing ''And China Has Hands'' (1937), which according to American [[Cultural history|cultural historian]] [[Michael Denning]] was, "repeatedly rejected by publishers (finally published in 1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denning|first1=Michael|title=The cultural front : the laboring of American culture in the twentieth century|date=2010|origyear=1996|publisher=Verso|location=London|isbn=978-1-84467-464-0|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; A personal history of Tsiang appears in the 2013 publication of ''The Hanging on Union Square'' in the Chronology section.

==Critical Response==
"H.T. Tsiang’s satiric, quasi-experimental novel ''The Hanging on Union Square'' explores leftist politics in Depression-era New York – an era of union busting and food lines – in an ambitious style that combines humor-laced allegory with snatches of poetry, newspaper quotations, non sequiturs, and slogans. Back in print for the first time since it was originally self-published in 1935, Kaya’s new edition of the novel follows out-of-work protagonist Mr. Nut from a workers’ cafeteria to dinner clubs and sexual exploitation in the highest echelons of society, then back again to the streets of Greenwich Village, where starving families rub shoulders with the recently evicted. In the process, Tsiang captures, hour-by-hour, Mr. Nut’s profound transformation from itinerant roustabout to radical activist. Adventurous and unclassifiable in its combination of avant-garde and proletarian concerns, The Hanging on Union Square is a major rediscovery of a uniquely American voice".&lt;ref name=Kaya/&gt; Cultural historian [[Alan M. Wald]] author of ''[http://uncpress.unc.edu/books/T-7734.html American Night: The Literary Left in the Era of the Cold War]'' describes the book as, "An artist of distinction, H.T. Tsiang created a genre unto itself in 1935 with ''The Hanging on Union Square''. Its republication after seventy-five years rescues - from an outlaw existence - a strangely and beautifully evocative satiric allegory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tsiang|first1=H.T. |editor-first=Floyd|editor-last=Cheung|title=The Hanging on Union Square: an American epic|date=2013|publisher=Kaya Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1885030092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Imitation Game''''' is a 2014 American&lt;!--Country is determined by the production company, not subject matter or location. Ref BFI as British. Do not change. --&gt; [[List of historical drama films|historical drama]] film directed by [[Morten Tyldum]] and written by [[Graham Moore (writer)|Graham Moore]], based on the biography ''[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]]'' by [[Andrew Hodges]]. It stars [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as British [[cryptanalyst]] [[Alan Turing]], who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during the [[Second World War]]. [[Keira Knightley]], [[Matthew Goode]], [[Rory Kinnear]], [[Charles Dance]], and [[Mark Strong]] also star.

The screenplay topped the annual [[Black List (survey)|Black List]] for best unproduced [[Hollywood]] scripts in 2011. [[The Weinstein Company]] acquired the film for $7 million in February 2014, the highest amount ever paid for U.S. distribution rights at the [[European Film Market]]. It was released theatrically in the United States on 28 November 2014.

''The Imitation Game'' grossed over $233 million worldwide on a $14 million production budget, making it the highest-grossing independent film of 2014. It received eight nominations at the [[87th Academy Awards]], winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], five nominations in the [[72nd Golden Globe Awards]], and three nominations at the [[21st Screen Actors Guild Awards]]. It also received nine [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nominations and won the People's Choice Award at the [[39th Toronto International Film Festival]].

The film was criticised by some for its inaccurate portrayal of historical events and Turing's character and relationships. However, the [[LGBT]] civil rights advocacy organization the [[Human Rights Campaign]] honoured it for bringing Turing's legacy to a wider audience.

==Plot==
In 1951, two policemen, Nock and Staehl, investigate the mathematician [[Alan Turing]] after an apparent break-in at his home. During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at [[Bletchley Park]] during the [[Second World War]].

In 1927, the young Turing is unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in [[cryptography]]. Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but Christopher soon dies from tuberculosis.

When Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. Under the direction of Commander [[Alastair Denniston]], he joins the cryptography team of [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], [[John Cairncross]], Peter Hilton, Keith Furman and Charles Richards. The team are [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|trying to decrypt]] the [[Enigma machine]], which the Nazis use to send coded messages.

Turing is difficult to work with, and considers his colleagues inferior; he works alone to design [[Bombe|a machine]] to decipher Enigma. After Denniston refuses to fund construction of the machine, Turing writes to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who puts Turing in charge of the team and funds the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements. [[Joan Clarke]], a Cambridge graduate, passes Turing’s test but her parents will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the female clerks who intercept the messages, and shares his plans with her.  With Clarke's help, Turing warms to the other colleagues, who begin to respect him.

Turing’s machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed, but cannot determine the Enigma settings before the Germans reset the Enigma encryption each day. Denniston orders it destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a female clerk about messages she receives, Turing has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate. Turing realises they cannot act on every decoded message or the Germans will realise Enigma has been broken.

Turing discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing’s sexuality. When the MI6 agent [[Stewart Menzies]] appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already and planted Cairncross to leak messages to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is gay. Heartbroken, Clarke states she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway. After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and that they can never see one another again or share what they have done.

In the 1950s, Turing is convicted of [[gross indecency]] and, in lieu of a jail sentence, undergoes [[chemical castration]] so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. She comforts him by saying that his work saved millions of lives.

==Production==
Before Cumberbatch joined the project, [[Warner Bros.]] bought the screenplay for a reported seven-figure sum because of [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s interest in playing Turing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Anne|title=Imitation Game Release Date Changed to November 28|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/why-weinstein-pushed-back-the-imitation-game-20141028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite tweet|user=StudiocanalUK|author=STUDIOCANALUK|number=466233085391290370|date=13 May 2014|title=Delighted to announce Alan Turing #movie THE IMITATION GAME w/ Benedict Cumberbatch will have it's UK release on Nov 14th 2014 @tigmovie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://deadline.com/2013/02/benedict-cumberbatch-in-talks-to-play-alan-turing-in-the-imitation-game-418902|title=Benedict Cumberbatch In Talks To Play Alan Turing In ‘The Imitation Game’|first=Mike|last=Fleming |work=Deadline|date=1 February 2013|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/the-imitation-game-begins-filming-with-benedict-cumberbatch-and-keira-knightley|title='The Imitation Game' Begins Filming With Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley |first=Germain |last=Lussier |work=Slash Film|date=16 September 2013|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/10/warner-bros-buys-spec-script-about-math-genius-biopic-because-leonardo-di-caprio-chasing-lead-role-181822|title=Warner Bros Buys Spec Script About Math Genius Alan Turing For Leonardo DiCaprio|first=Nikki|last=Finke|work=Deadline|date=11 October 2011|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, DiCaprio did not come on board and the rights of the script reverted to the screenwriter.

[[File:Bletchley Park - Draco2008.jpg|thumb|[[Bletchley Park]], "the home of the codebreakers" where parts of the film were shot]]
[[Principal photography]] began on 15 September 2013 in Britain. Filming locations included Turing's former school, [[Sherborne School|Sherborne]], Bletchley Park, where Turing and his colleagues worked during the war, and [[Central Saint Martins]] campus on [[Southampton Row]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/i/Imitation-Game.html#.VcD-sflViko|title=The Imitation Game film locations|work=The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other locations included towns in England such as [[Nettlebed]] ([[Joyce Grove]] in [[Oxfordshire]]) and [[Chesham]] ([[Buckinghamshire]]). Scenes were also filmed at [[Bicester Airfield]] and outside the [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]] building in [[Chancery Lane]], and at [[West London Film Studios]]. Principal photography finished on 11 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/10713158.Sherlock___s_on_the_trail_of_a_new_movie_blockbuster|title=Sherlock’s on the trail of a new movie blockbuster|work=The Oxford Times|date=3 October 2013|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bombe]] seen in the film is based on a replica of Turing's original machine, which is housed in the museum at Bletchley Park.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hen the camera at the end of the film has those beautiful shots of the young boy, the young Alan, and he's meeting with the professor who's telling him his friend Christopher is dead, and the camera is pushing in on him, I play Christopher's theme that we heard very early on in the film. There's a simple continuity there. It's the accumulation of these moments that I can slowly but surely play that make it even stronger.&lt;ref name="collider" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The score received an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], losing to the score of ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]'', also composed by Desplat.

Cumberbatch's performance was met with widespread acclaim from critics. ''[[TIME]]'' ranked Cumberbatch's portrayal number one in its Top 10 film performances of 2014, with the magazine's chief film critic [[Richard Corliss]] calling Cumberbatch's characterisation "the actor's oddest, fullest, most ''Cumberbatchian'' character yet ... he doesn't play Turing so much as inhabit him, bravely and sympathetically but without mediation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10 Best Movie Performances|url=http://time.com/3616838/top-10-best-movie-performances-2014/|website=TIME magazine | date=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corliss|first1=Richard|title=Review: The Imitation Game: Dancing With Dr. Strange|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_imitation_game/|website=Time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' declared Turing "the role of Cumberbatch's career", while [[A.O.

===The Turing family===
Despite earlier reservations, Turing's niece Inagh Payne told [[Allan Beswick]] of [[BBC Radio Manchester]] that the film "really did honour my uncle" after she watched the film at the [[London Film Festival]] in October 2014. In the same interview, Turing's nephew [[Dermot Turing]] stated that Cumberbatch is "perfect casting. I couldn't think of anyone better". James Turing, a great-nephew of the code-breaker, said Cumberbatch "knows things that I never knew before. The amount of knowledge he has about Alan is amazing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beswick|first1=Allan|title=Turing's family on The Imitation Game|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p027dz18|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social action==
In January 2015, Cumberbatch, comedian-actor [[Stephen Fry]], producer [[Harvey Weinstein]], and Turing's great-niece Rachel Barnes launched a campaign to pardon the 49,000 gay men convicted under the same law that led to Turing's chemical castration. An open letter published in ''The Guardian'' urged the British government and the Royal family, particularly [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and the [[Duke of Cambridge|Duke]] and [[Duchess of Cambridge]], to aid the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Benedict Cumberbatch in call to pardon convicted gay men|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31070115|website=BBC | date=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Rights Campaign's [[Chad Griffin]] also offered his endorsement, saying: "Over 49,000 other gay men and women were persecuted in England under the same law. Turing was pardoned by Queen Elizabeth II in 2013. The others were not. Honor this movie. Honor this man. And honor the movement to bring justice to the other 49,000."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feinberg|first1=Scott|title=Benedict Cumberbatch, Stephen Fry Call for Pardons for Gays Persecuted Alongside 'Imitation Game' Subject|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/benedict-cumberbatch-stephen-fry-call-766279|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aiding the cause were campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]], ''[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]'' magazine, and other high-profile figures in the gay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=Alistair|title=Stephen Fry's campaign to pardon all gay men ruined by 'malicious' law|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/stephen-frys-campaign-to-pardon-all-gay-men-ruined-by-malicious-law-9997777.html|website=Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:KeiraKnightleyByAndreaRaffin2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Knightley portrayed code breaker [[Joan Clarke]]]]

During production, there was criticism regarding the film's purported downplaying of Turing's homosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/07/31/comment-hollywood-should-stay-true-to-the-real-story-of-alan-turing|title=Comment: Hollywood should stay true to the real story of Alan Turing|first=Harriet|last=Lucas|work=Pink News|date=31 July 2013|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly condemning the portrayal of his relationship with close friend and one-time fiancée [[Joan Clarke]]. Hodges, author of the book upon which the film was based, described the script as having "built up the relationship with Joan much more than it actually was".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/06/24/alan-turings-biographer-criticises-upcoming-biopic-for-downplaying-gay-identity|title=Alan Turing's biographer criticises upcoming biopic for downplaying gay identity|first=Aaron|last=Day|work=Pink News|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's niece Payne thought that Knightley was inappropriately cast, as she described the real Clarke as "rather plain", and said: "I think they might be trying to romanticise it. It makes me a bit mad. You want the film to show it as it was, not a lot of nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-11-19/benedict-cumberbatch-and-keira-knightleys-imitation-game-romance-labelled-inaccurate|title=Imitation Game filmmakers accused of romanticising the relationship between Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley's characters by Alan Turing's niece, Inagh Payne|first=Susanna|last=Lazarus|work=Radio Times|date=19 November 2013|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to ''Empire'', director Tyldum expressed his decision to take on the project: "It is such a complex story. It was the gay rights element, but also how his (Turing's) ideas were kept secret and how incredibly important his work was during the war, that he was never given credit for it".&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt; In an interview for ''[[GQ|GQ UK]]'', Matthew Goode, who plays fellow cryptographer [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] in the film, stated that the script focuses on "Turing's life and how as a nation we celebrated him as being a hero by chemically castrating him because he was gay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2013-06/24/matthew-goode-interview-2013-hogan-campaign|title=Matthew Goode announced as new face of Hogan Shoes|first=Nick|last=Carvell|work=GQ Magazine|date=25 June 2013|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers of the film stated: "There is not – and never has been – a version of our script where Alan Turing is anything other than homosexual, nor have we included fictitious sex scenes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/08/19/producers-of-alan-turing-film-reject-criticism-of-project|title=Producers of Alan Turing film reject criticism of project|first=Scott|last=Roberts|work=Pink News|date=19 August 2013|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 2015 interview with ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', its screenwriter Graham Moore said in response to complaints about the film's historical accuracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When you use the language of "fact checking" to talk about a film, I think you're sort of fundamentally misunderstanding how art works. You don't fact check Monet's ''[[Water Lilies]]''. That's not what water lilies look like, that's what the sensation of experiencing water lilies feel like.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A lot of historical films sometimes feel like people reading a Wikipedia page to you onscreen, like just reciting "and then he did that, and then he did that, and then he did this other thing" – it's like a "Greatest Hits" compilation. We wanted the movie to be emotional and passionate. Our goal was to give you "What does Alan Turing feel like?" What does his story feel like? What'd it feel like to be Alan Turing? Can we create the experience of sort of "Alan Turing-ness" for an audience based on his life?&lt;ref name="huffpo-resp"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the most part, Hodges has not commented on the historical accuracy of the film, alluding to contractual obligations involving the film rights to his biography.&lt;ref name="wapo-countable"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/what-imitation-game-didnt-tell-you-about-alan-turings-greatest-triumph/2015/02/20/ffd210b6-b606-11e4-9423-f3d0a1ec335c_story.html?tid=HP_more?tid=HP_more | title=What 'The Imitation Game' didn't tell you about Turing's greatest triumph | first=Joel | last=Achenbach | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical inaccuracies==
The following events depicted in the film did not happen in real life.

===Historical events===
* The naming of the Enigma-breaking machine "Christopher" after Turing's childhood friend, with Turing the only cryptographer working on it while others either did not help or outright opposed it.
*: In reality, this electromechanical machine was called "Victory" and it was a collaborative, not individual, effort. It was a British [[Bombe]] machine, which was partly inspired by a design by the Polish cryptanalyst [[Marian Rejewski]]. Rejewski designed a machine in 1938, called [[Bomba (cryptography)|''bomba kryptologiczna'']], which had broken an earlier version of Germany's Enigma machines by the [[Biuro Szyfrów|Polish Cipher Bureau]] before the Second World War.&lt;ref name="harv"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozaczuk |first=Władysław |authorlink=Władysław Kozaczuk |title=Enigma: How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War Two |editor1-first=Christopher |editor1-last=Kasparek |editor1-link=Christopher Kasparek |location=Frederick, MD |publisher=University Publications of America |year=1984 |isbn=0-89093-547-5 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5hJnAAAAMAAJ}}|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*: A new machine with a different strategy was designed by Turing in 1940 with a major contribution from mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]], who goes unmentioned in the film, his contribution instead attributed to [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]].&lt;ref name="slate-lva"/&gt; 
* The building of only one machine, with Turing playing a large role in its construction.
*:More than 200 British Bombes were built under the supervision of chief engineer [[Harold Keen]] of the [[British Tabulating Machine Company]]. None of them were built at Bletchley Park.&lt;ref name="haigh"/&gt;
{{multiple image | direction = vertical | width = 250 | footer = Turing's rebuilt [[bombe]] machine, called Christopher in the film, on display at Bletchley Park Museum | image1 = Bomba turninga1.jpg | image2 = Bomba turninga2.jpg }}
* The overall plot arc in which the British cryptographers were stymied for the first few years of the war and then a sudden breakthrough enabled them to finally break Enigma.
*: In reality, the Polish cryptanalysts [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Jerzy Różycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]] from the [[Biuro Szyfrów|Polish Cipher Bureau]] had been breaking German Enigma messages since 1932. Their effort allowed the Poles to build replicas of German machines in Warsaw for the Polish secret service. Just before the war, the Polish secret service revealed their work to their French and British allies in a secret meeting on 26 and 27 July 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Erskine: ''The Poles Reveal their Secrets&amp;nbsp;– Alastair Dennistons's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry''. Cryptologia. Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Taylor &amp; Francis, Philadelphia PA 30.2006,4, p.&amp;nbsp;294.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pyry (neighborhood)|Pyry]] near [[Warsaw]]. Thousands of men and women were working on the project by the time the war ended in 1945. The computing advances did not obviate the need for human labor, as the many teams of largely female operators certainly knew. Throughout the war, there were breakthroughs and setbacks when the design or use of the German Enigma machines was changed and the Bletchley Park code breakers had to adapt.&lt;ref name="nyrb-cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haigh"/&gt;{{pb}}Moreover, the breakthrough depicted in the film gives the impression that the ''Bombe'' was developed first, and only became effective later, after it was realised that deciphering could be made easier by looking for known or speculated items contained in an intercepted message, a practice known in cryptanalysis as employing a ''[[known-plaintext attack|crib]]''. In reality, the opposite was true: the use of cribs was the central [[attack model]] upon which the Bombe's principal design was based, rather than being an afterthought to the design.
* The suggestion that Enigma was the only German cipher broken at Bletchley Park.
*: The breaking of the [[Lorenz cipher]], codenamed "Tunny", arguably made just as important a contribution to Ultra intelligence as the breaking of Enigma, and breaking Tunny was in many ways more difficult. Neither the Tunny effort nor its main contributors, mathematician [[W. T. Tutte|W. T. "Bill" Tutte]] and electrical engineer [[Tommy Flowers]], are mentioned in the film. The [[Colossus computer]] they built goes unmentioned by name in the film, although there is an implicit suggestion that Turing was responsible for it, which he was not.&lt;ref name="haigh"/&gt;
* The scene where the [[Hut 8]] team decides not to use broken codes to stop a German raid on a convoy that the brother of one of the code breakers ([[Peter Hilton]]) is serving on, to hide the fact they have broken the code.
*: In reality, Hilton had no such brother, and decisions about [[Ultra#Safeguarding of sources|when and whether to use data from Ultra intelligence]] were made at much higher administrative levels.&lt;ref name="slate-lva"/&gt;
* The sequence in which Turing writes a letter to Churchill to gain control over the project and obtain funding for the decryption machine.
*: Turing was actually not alone in making a different request with a number of colleagues, including Hugh Alexander, writing a letter to Churchill (who had earlier visited there) in an effort to get more administrative resources sent to Bletchley Park, which Churchill immediately did.&lt;ref name="slate-lva"/&gt;
* The recruitment of Joan Clarke as a result of an examination after solving a crossword puzzle in a newspaper.
*: In reality, [[Joan Clarke]] was recruited by her former academic supervisor, [[Gordon Welchman]], to the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]].&lt;ref name="slate-lva"/&gt;  Puzzles were used by Bletchley Park in recruitment but neither Turing nor Clarke were ever involved with them.&lt;ref name="guard-puzzle"/&gt;

===Turing's personality and personal life===
* The presentation of Turing's social difficulties as so severe as to suggest [[Asperger syndrome]] or some form of [[autism spectrum|autism]].
:: While a few writers and researchers have tried to assign [[Retrospective diagnoses of autism|such a retrospective diagnosis]] to Turing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=O'Connell | first=H. | last2=Fitzgerald | first2=M. | date=2003 | title= Did Alan Turing have Asperger's syndrome? | journal=Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine | volume=20 | number=1 | pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is true that he had his share of eccentricities, the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film – social awkwardness, difficulty working cooperatively with others, and tendency to take things too literally – bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing. Despite enjoying working alone, Turing was sociable and had friends, was also viewed as having a sense of humour, and had good working relationships with colleagues.&lt;ref name="nyrb-cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spec-asp"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/life/status-anxiety/9410662/the-misguided-bid-to-turn-alan-turing-into-an-aspergers-martyr/ | title=The misguided bid to turn Alan Turing into an Asperger's martyr | first=Toby | last=Young | newspaper=[[The Spectator]] | location=UK | date=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]]'', Burnett Books Ltd, 1983. {{ISBN|0-09-911641-3}}, pp. 272–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haigh"/&gt;
* The scenes depicting Turing's childhood friend, including the manner in which Turing learned of Morcom's illness and death.&lt;ref name="g-avt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slate-lva"/&gt;
* The sequence, which brackets the whole movie, in which Turing is arrested in 1951 when a detective suspects him of being a Soviet spy, which leads to the discovery that Turing is gay.
*: Turing's arrest was in 1952. The detective in the film and the interview as portrayed are fictional. Turing was investigated for his homosexuality after a robbery at his house and was never investigated for espionage.&lt;ref name="g-avt"/&gt;
* The suggestion that [[chemical castration]] made Turing unable to think clearly or do any work.
*: Despite physical weakness and changes in Turing's body including [[gynaecomastia]], at that time he was doing innovative work on [[mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]], inspired by the very changes his body was undergoing due to chemical castration.&lt;ref name="nyrb-cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slate-lva"/&gt;
* The scene in which Clarke visits Turing in his home while he is serving probation.
*: There is no record of Clarke ever visiting Turing's residence during his probation, although Turing did stay in touch with her after the war and informed her of his upcoming trial for indecency.&lt;ref name="slate-lva"/&gt;
* The statement that Turing committed suicide after a year of hormone treatment.
*: In reality, the nature of Turing's death is a matter of considerable debate. The chemical castration period ended fourteen months before his death. The official inquest into his death ruled that he had committed suicide by consuming a cyanide-laced apple. Turing biographer Andrew Hodges believes the death was indeed a suicide, re-enacting the poisoned apple from ''[[Snow White]]'', Turing's favourite fairy tale, with some deliberate ambiguity included to permit Turing's mother to interpret it as an accident. However, [[Jack Copeland]], an editor of volumes of Turing's work and Director of the Turing Archive for the History of Computing, has suggested that Turing's death may have been accidental, caused by the cyanide fumes produced by an experiment in his spare room, and that the investigation was poorly conducted.&lt;ref name="slate-lva"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 | title=Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable' | first=Roland | last=Pease | publisher=BBC News | date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personalities and actions of other characters===
* The depiction of Commander [[Alastair Denniston|Denniston]] as a rigid officer, bound by military thinking and eager to shut down the decryption machine when it fails to deliver results.
*: Denniston's grandchildren stated that the film takes an "unwarranted sideswipe" at their grandfather's memory, showing him to be a "baddy" and a "hectoring character" who hinders the work of Turing. They said their grandfather had a completely different temperament from the one portrayed in the film and was entirely supportive of the work done by cryptographers under his command.&lt;ref name="slate-lva"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bletchley Park commander not the 'baddy' he is in The Imitation Game, family say|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11256888/Bletchley-Park-commander-not-the-baddy-he-is-in-The-Imitation-Game-family-say.html|newspaper=The Telegraph | location=London|first=Hannah|last=Furness|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of the film's depicted interactions between Turing and Denniston. Indeed, before the war, Denniston recruited lecturers at Oxford and Cambridge, and Turing, Welchman, and others began working part-time for him then.&lt;ref name=hut6story&gt;{{Cite book | last = Welchman | first = Gordon | authorlink = Gordon Welchman | year = 1997 | title = The Hut 6 Story | publisher = M &amp; M Baldwin | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-947712-34-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} Turing was always respected and considered one of the best code-breakers at Bletchley Park&lt;ref name="slate-lva"/&gt; and in short order took on the role of a leader there.&lt;ref name="haigh"/&gt;
* All the interactions between Turing and [[Stewart Menzies]], head of the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]].
*: There are no records showing that they interacted at all during Turing's time at Bletchley Park.&lt;ref name="slate-lva"/&gt;
* An espionage subplot involving Turing and Soviet spy [[John Cairncross]].
*: Turing and Cairncross worked in different areas of Bletchley Park and there is no evidence they ever met.&lt;ref name="nyrb-cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slate-lva"/&gt; Alex Von Tunzelmann was angered by this subplot (which suggests that Turing was for a while blackmailed into not revealing Cairncross as a spy lest his homosexuality be revealed), writing that "creative licence is one thing, but slandering a great man's reputation – while buying into the nasty 1950s prejudice that gay men automatically constituted a security risk – is quite another."&lt;ref name="g-avt"/&gt; 
* [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] is said to have won the [[British Chess Championship]] twice near the beginning of the film. Although this is true, he won it once in 1938 and the second time only in 1956, after the war.

'''The Presbytère''' is an architecturally important building in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].

Built in 1791 as a matching structure for [[the Cabildo]], which flanks the cathedral on the other side, it is one of the nation's best examples of formal [[colonial Spanish architecture]] (with many [[neo-Renaissance]] elements).&lt;ref name="quote=in the Spanish Colonial style, with 'a full panoply of Renaissance architectural forms'"&gt;{{cite book|title=The French Quarter of New Orleans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=505nWtw-5fMC&amp;pg=PA53|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-61703-497-8|page=53|quote=in the Spanish Colonial style, with 'a full panoply of Renaissance architectural forms'}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1970, and is now a property of the [[Louisiana State Museum]].

==Description ==
The Presbytère is located on the northwest side of Jackson Square, between the cathedral and St. Ann Street.  It is a two-story brick building, originally built with a flat roof that had a [[balustrade]] topped by urns.  Its ground floor has a nine-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] open [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] of elliptical arches, with [[pilaster]]ed corners.  The upper level also has arched openings, all articulated by pilasters, with multipane windows.  The center three bays on both levels have engaged columns on either side, and are topped as a group by a gabled [[pediment]].  A [[dormer]]ed [[mansard roof]] was added in 1847, which is topped by a [[louver]]ed cupola.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;

==History==
The Presbytère was designed in 1791 by the French-born [[Gilberto Guillemard]] to match [[the Cabildo]], or Town Hall, on the other side of St. Louis Cathedral. By 1798, only the first floor had been completed, and its second floor was not completed until 1813.  Originally called the '''{{lang|es|Casa Curial}}''' (‘Ecclesiastical House’), its name derives from the fact that it was built on the former site of the residence of the [[Capuchin monks]] and [[presbytery (residence)|presbytery]] (rectory, ''{{lang|fr|{{linktext|presbytère}}}}''  in French).&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt; While intended to house clergy, it was never used as a religious residence.&lt;ref name="TP"&gt;New Orleans ''Times-Picayune'', Jun 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The building initially was used for commercial purposes until 1834, when it was used by the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]].

In 1853, cathedral officials sold the Presbytère to the city, and in 1908 the city sold it to the state. In 1911 it became part of the [[Louisiana State Museum]].&lt;ref name="TP"/&gt;  It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: The Presbytere|url={{NHLS url|id=70000257}} |format=pdf|date=June 30, 1975 |author=Patricia Heintzelman |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NHLS url|id=70000257|title=''Accompanying  photo, exterior, from 1975''|photos=y}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(239&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[cupola]] was replaced atop the Presbytère. The cupola had been missing since the [[New Orleans Hurricane of 1915]].&lt;ref name="TP"/&gt;

The '''Patriotic Revolutionary Youth Movement''' ({{lang-ku|Tevgera Ciwanen Welatparêz Yên Şoreşger}}, {{lang-tr|Yurtsever Devrimci Gençlik Hareket}}, '''YDG-H''') is the urban, militant youth wing of [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-kurds-youth-idUSKCN0RR0DS20150927|title=A new generation of Kurdish militants takes fight to Turkey's cities|date=2015-09-27|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trained by more experienced PKK cadres for urban fighting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/escalating-turkish-civil-war-sees-young-fighters-on-front-a-1076663.html|title=Children of the PKK: The Growing Intensity of Turkey's Civil War - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consisting mostly of children and adults in the 15-25 age group,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/08/turkey-kurds-pkk-armed-young-militias.html|title=PKK looks to the future with creation of youth militias|date=2015-08-31|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was reportedly established in 2006.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The group started to clash with Turkish security forces and tried to enforce their authority in the areas they were located in 2014 as part of a strategy which involved unilateral declaration of autonomy in various towns in Southeast Anatolia, and creation of trenches and barricades reinforced with IEDs and explosives to deny security forces access to the urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/western-europemediterranean/turkey/human-cost-pkk-conflict-turkey-case-sur|title=The Human Cost of the PKK Conflict in Turkey: The Case of Sur|date=2016-03-17|work=Crisis Group|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group is in favor of [[autonomy|regional autonomy]] or a separate state for the [[Kurdish people]] in [[Southeast Anatolia]]. Other claimed objectives of the YDG-H include stopping all activities related to drugs and prostitution, and other similar crimes in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=VICE News|title=PKK Youth Fight for Autonomy in Turkey|date=2015-02-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwe4msjHCXs|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
