'''''A Change of Sex''''' is a multi-part [[television documentary]] about English [[trans woman]] Julia Grant. The first chapter, initially titled ''George'', premiered on [[BBC2]] in 1979. It is one of the first [[documentary film]]s about [[transgender]] issues.

BBC2 repeated the programme in 1980, followed by two new chapters, ''Julia: The First Year'' and ''Julia: My Body, My Choice''. A revised version aired in 1994, accompanied by another new chapter, ''The Untold Story'', which updates viewers on Julia's life of the past 15 years. The final instalment, ''Julia Gets Her Man'', followed in 1999. David Pearson directed the films.

Julia Grant was born in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Grant |first=Julia |subject-link= |interviewer=Sam Johnson |title=Julia Grant - The Transgender Zone Interviews |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GG6AiDAcKk |type=Interview: video |website=[[YouTube]] |date=25 March 2014 |access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary introduces us to her as George Roberts, a catering manager. Although she performs as a [[drag queen]], George says she has never felt at home in [[gay male culture]]. She feels inside that she is a woman, and she wishes for [[Sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|sex reassignment surgery]]. The [[National Health Service]] refers her to the Gender Identity Clinic at [[Charing Cross Hospital]]. As she sits in the consulting room, we hear the voice of her psychiatrist, but we never see his face. His attitude toward Julia is stern and disparaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/television-review-a-change-isnt-always-as-good-as-a-rest-1377341.html |title=Television (Review) / A change isn't always as good as a rest |last=Sutcliffe |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster) |date=18 August 1994 |website=[[The Independent]] |access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His deskside manner was the inspiration for the character [[List of The League of Gentlemen characters#Additional characters|Dr Ira Carlton]], a "despotic GP who rules his patients with eccentric zeal" in the [[black comedy]] series ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The League of Gentlemen |last=Hunt |first=Leon |year=2008 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |page=124 |isbn=978-1-84457-269-4 |oclc=226357069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the consulting room, the filmmakers follow Julia through her experiences of [[Hormone replacement therapy (transgender)|hormone therapy]], shopping for women's clothing, [[Gender confirmation surgery|gender confirmation surgeries]],&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gscene.com/news/letter-to-editor-manchester-pride/ |title=Letter to Editor: Manchester Pride |date=17 October 2013 |last1=Ledward |first1=James |last2=Grant |first2=Julia |website=Gscene |access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; her professional life, and other dimensions of her [[Transitioning (transgender)|transition]].

==Production and broadcast==
''A Change of Sex'' began as an episode of ''Inside Story'', a documentary [[television series]] oriented toward [[investigative journalism]]. There was sufficient interest in the episode—which was titled ''George''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b72d95407 |title=George (1979) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=[[BFI Film &amp; TV Database]] |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;—for Pearson to explore Julia's story further. He and his crew filmed her progress in 1979 and 1980. ''George'' was retitled ''George: The Big Decision'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6feabcf8 |title=George - The Big Decision (1980) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=[[BFI Film &amp; TV Database]] |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the more recent footage was edited into two new chapters: ''Julia: The First Year''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6feabff2 |title=Julia - The First Year (1980) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=[[BFI Film &amp; TV Database]] |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Julia: My Body, My Choice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6feac2cb |title=Julia - My Body, My Choice (1980) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=[[BFI Film &amp; TV Database]] |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This three-film series was titled ''A Change of Sex'', and BBC2 broadcast it in October 1980. [[New English Library]] published Julia's autobiography, ''George and Julia'', that same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Julia |title=George and Julia |date=1980 |publisher=[[New English Library]] |location=London |isbn=0-450-04715-6 |oclc=64747941}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theheroines2.blogspot.com/2014/04/julia-grant-george-and-julia.html |title=Julia Grant - ''George and Julia'' |date=28 April 2014 |website=Transgender Biography Books |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925000032/https://theheroines2.blogspot.com/2014/04/julia-grant-just-julia-story-of.html |archive-date=2016-09-25 |access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Pearson revisited Julia to film a fourth chapter of the documentary about her life.&lt;ref name="justjulia"&gt;{{cite book |title=Just Julia: The Story of an Extraordinary Woman |last=Grant |first=Julia |date=1994 |publisher=Boxtree |isbn=978-1-85283-481-4 |oclc=31755479}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|269}} Filming and editing continued into 1994,&lt;ref name="justjulia"/&gt;{{rp|269}} but the earlier programmes were also edited in order to make a four-part story into a trilogy: ''George &amp; Julia'', ''Desperate Measures'', and ''The Untold Story''. This revised version of ''A Change of Sex'' aired on BBC2 in August 1994.

Before the [[National Health Service]] will approve the surgical procedures, they refer him to a psychiatrist in the Gender Identity Clinic at Charing Cross Hospital. The psychiatrist tells George that he must first live as a woman for one year. George throws away his men's clothing, informs his employer, and (per the hospital's requirements) finds a new flat nearer to the clinic.

[[File:Annunciation - Jan van Eyck - 1434 - NG Wash DC.jpg|thumb|''The Annunciation'', [[Oil painting|Oil]] [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred from wood to canvas]], c. 1434. [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, DC]], 93 x 37 cm]]

'''''The Annunciation''''' is an oil painting by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] master [[Jan van Eyck]], from around 1434-1436.  The panel is housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]], in Washington D.C.  It was originally on [[panel painting|panel]] but has been [[transfer of panel paintings|transferred]] to canvas.  It is thought that it was the left (inner) wing of a [[triptych]]; there has been no sighting of the other wings since before 1817. The annunciation is a highly complex work, whose [[iconography]] is still debated by art historians.

The picture depicts the [[Annunciation]] by the [[Archangel Gabriel]] to the [[Virgin Mary]] that she will bear the son of God ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:26-38).  The inscription shows his words: &lt;small&gt;''AVE GRÃ. PLENA''&lt;/small&gt; or "Hail, full of grace...".&lt;ref&gt;Contracted from 28 "et ingressus angelus ad eam dixit  '''ave gratia plena''' Dominus tecum benedicta tu in mulieribus ..." - [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&amp;chapter=1&amp;version=4 Latin Vulgate];  28"And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women." [[Authorised Version]]. [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lucas%201%20;&amp;version=9; King James (Authorised) Version]&lt;/ref&gt;   She modestly draws back and responds, &lt;small&gt;''ECCE ANCILLA DÑI''&lt;/small&gt; or "Behold the [[handmaiden]] of the Lord".&lt;ref&gt;Contracted from 38"dixit autem Maria '''ecce ancilla Domini''' fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum et discessit ab illa angelus" Latin [[Vulgate]]; 38"And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her." King James/Authorised Version.&lt;/ref&gt;   The words appear upside down because they are directed to God and are therefore inscribed with a God's-eye view. The [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] descend to her on [[Seven rays|seven rays of light]] from the upper window to the left, with the dove symbolizing the [[Holy Spirit]] following the same path; "This is the moment God's plan for salvation is set in motion. Through Christ's human incarnation the old era of the Law is transformed into a new era of [[Divine Grace|Grace]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.46.html|title=Jan van Eyck, Netherlandish, c. 1390 - 1441, The Annunciation, c. 1434/1436|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Gallery of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Temple==
The setting develops this theme.  Mary was believed in the Middle Ages to have been a very studious girl who was engaged by the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] with other selected maidens to spin new curtains for the [[Holy of Holies]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller p.34 The source was the [[apocrypha]]l [[Protoevangelium of James]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book she is reading here is too large to be a lady's [[Book of Hours]]; as in other paintings she is engaged in serious study in a part of the Temple (one medieval authority specified  that she was reading the Book of Isaiah when Gabriel arrived).&lt;ref&gt;Schiller pp.34-5, 41-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The van Eycks were almost the first to use this setting in panel painting, but it appears earlier in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and in an altarpiece of 1397 from the same monastery for which this painting was probably ordered.&lt;ref&gt;Hand 1986, p.81, who does not mention the altarpiece of 1397 by [[Melchior Broederlam]] (from the Chartreuse de Champmol, now Dijon Museum) - Schiller p.49 &amp; (fig 111), also discussed in Purtle 1999,p.4, and in the Losh External link below (fig 4)[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:BroedelamAnnunciation.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture moves from older, round [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] forms above, to (slightly) pointed Gothic arches below, with the higher levels largely in darkness, and the floor level well-lit.&lt;ref&gt;Many recent writers have stressed that the architecture of the buildings is not as anomalous, and therefore symbolic, as it might appear, and as Panovsky thought it. See Harbison pp. 151-57, &amp; 212, also Purtle 1999, p.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The gloom of the [[Old Covenant]] is about to be succeeded by the light of the [[New Covenant]].  The flat timber roof is in poor repair, with planks out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Purtle, 1999, p 2 and notes&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of Romanesque architecture to identify Jewish rather than Christian settings is a regular feature of the paintings of van Eyck and his followers, and other paintings show both styles in the same building in a symbolic way.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, pp. 49-50. Purtle 1999, p. 4 and notes 9-14. Also see Gallery, and [http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph2/articles_assaph2/09Pinson.pdf ''The Iconography of the Temple in Northern Renaissance Art'' by Yona Pinson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326170616/http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph2/articles_assaph2/09Pinson.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:Jan van Eyck 081.jpg|thumb|left|Floor tiles: [[David]] slaying [[Goliath]] in front, [[Samson]] pulling down the [[Philistine]]s' Temple behind]]

The decoration of the Temple is naturally all derived from the [[Old Testament]], but the subjects shown are those believed in the Middle Ages to prefigure the coming of Christ the [[Messiah]].  In the floor tiles [[David]]'s slaying of [[Goliath]] (centre front), foretells Christ's triumph over the devil.  Behind this, [[Samson]] pulls down the Temple of the [[Philistine]]s, prefiguring both the Crucifixion and the [[Last Judgement]], according to medieval authorities.  To the left, [[Delilah]] is cutting Samson's hair (Betrayal of Christ), and behind he slays the Philistines (Christ's triumph over sin).   The death of [[Absalom]] and possibly that of [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] are identified by some art historians, although only tiny sections are visible.  [[Erwin Panofsky]], who developed much of this analysis, proposed a scheme for the significance of the [[astrological symbol]]s in the round border tiles, and other versions have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Hand pp. 80-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The rear wall has a single stained glass window, where Jehovah stands, above triple plain-glazed windows below, which perhaps suggest the Christian trinity.  On either side of the single window are dim wall-paintings of the ''Finding of Moses'' by [[Pharaoh]]'s daughter (left, pre-figuring the Annunciation itself), and Moses receiving the [[Ten Commandments]] (right, paralleling the [[New Covenant]] Christ would bring).  Below them are roundels with [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], for which various symbolic functions have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.80, Purtle, 1999, pp 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;  The lilies are a traditional attribute of Mary, standing for purity.  The empty stool may be an "[[hetoimasia|empty throne]]", a symbol for Christ going back to early [[Byzantine art]].&lt;ref&gt;Hand pp 79 &amp; 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==The figures==
[[File:Annunciation - Virgin and Angel - Jan van Eyck - 1434 - NG Wash DC.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Detail - Mary and Gabriel]]

It has been suggested that Mary has been given the features of [[Infanta Isabel, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabella of Portugal]], wife of [[Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], who may well have commissioned the painting from van Eyck, his (part-time) court painter.&lt;ref&gt;Hand 1986, p.82. Carra Ferguson O'Meara (1981) originated the suggestion&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary wears a robe in her usual blue, which is trimmed in [[ermine]], reserved for royalty, which would suit this theory, although the Middle Ages placed great emphasis on Mary's [[Davidic line|royal descent]] in any case.  As is usual, especially in the North, Mary's features are less attractive than those of Gabriel; being a sexless angel there was considered to be no possibility of his beauty causing inappropriate thoughts in the onlooker.  Neither figure has a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]]; these were being dispensed with in Early Netherlandish art in the interests of realism - eventually the Italians would follow.  Mary's posture is ambiguous; it is not clear if she is standing, kneeling or sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size===
Many writers, including Hand, call the figures over-large compared to the architecture.  This is certainly a feature of some of van Eyck's depictions of Mary in a Church setting, with a particular theological meaning.  In ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'' in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]] where this theme is most developed: the figure of Mary is some sixty feet high, filling much of the height of a tall Gothic church.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 1991, pp. 169-187&lt;/ref&gt; It is not so clear that any effect of this type is intended here; there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building.  If, for example, the setting were a first floor room, or one giving on to a courtyard, the windows might be lower than is normal in a medieval church.  The size of the plain glass roundels does not seem disproportionate with the figures.

===Sacramental themes===
[[File:Louvre Le sacerdoce de la Vierge.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Le sacerdoce de la Vierge'' (The Priesthood of the Virgin), 1425-50, Louvre, unknown French artist]]
Another of van Eyck's themes, and that of other Early Netherlandish painters, is indicated by the large [[cope]] over a [[dalmatic]] worn by [[Gabriel]].  This would, in a human, mark him as a celebrant or attendant at a [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]].  Mary is facing a table with a book upon it about the right size to be a [[Gospel Book]] or [[Missal]], and has her hands raised in a gesture known as the ''expansis manibus''.  This is certainly to convey the alarm and uncertainty with which she usually greets the surprising apparition of Gabriel and his news, but is also a gesture used by a priest at certain points of a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.81 and notes&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting has been connected with the ''Golden Mass'' ("Missa Aurea"), a [[liturgical drama]], or dramatised Mass, popular in the Netherlands at the time, which included a staging of the Annunciation as the [[Gospel]] reading.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.81, and Lane, pp 47-50; both citing: Carol J Purtle, 1982. Also Purtle 1999 note 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobus, 1999, pp 1-4 describes the Golden Mass in the context of Giotto's Arena Chapel frescoes&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, this is part of a common theme in Early Netherlandish art where Mary, as intermediary between the faithful and God, is compared to, or seen as, a priest celebrating Mass.  Her personal sacrifice of her son  is compared to the ritual sacrifice enacted by the priest in the Mass.  In a surviving extreme example in the [[Louvre]] she is shown clearly wearing vestments and celebrating mass at an [[altar]]; more often, as here, the comparison is made more subtly.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, 1984, pp 41-77. The Louvre ''Le sacerdoce de la Vierge'' is fig 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other panels of the triptych==
No more has been heard of the rest of the triptych since the mentions below in the Provenance.  It would presumably have been an altarpiece, for a side-altar or small chapel.  The subjects of the other missing panels remain uncertain; a ''[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]'' or ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' are considered most likely for the central panel, at least twice as wide as this one, with a ''Visitation of Mary'' or ''Presentation of Jesus'' on the right-hand wing matching this one.  The outer sides of the wings would probably have been painted in some fashion, but if there was a full scene, or even a figure in [[grisaille]] on the back of this, it is unlikely it would have been discarded when the painting was transferred to canvas in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  No doubt the themes of this wing would originally have related to those in the other wings in ways we cannot now guess.

==Painting technique==
[[File:Jan van Eyck 078.jpg|thumb|230px|The rear wall: Moses found in the bullrushes on the wall, [[stained glass]] of [[Jehovah]], with [[Seraphim]] above. The wall-painting is not in the underdrawing]]
A cleaning in 1998, and examination by modern technical methods such as infrared reflectograms, has revealed much about van Eyck's technique here, which is consistent with other works of his such as the [[Arnolfini Portrait]].  His [[underdrawing]] has been revealed, and so have many changes made in the course of painting the work.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Eyck's superb oil painting technique is evident throughout.  [[Gold leaf]] is only used for the seven rays coming in from the left; paint is used for all the gold on Gabriel, often worked [[wet-on-wet]] to achieve the textural effects of his [[brocade]]d clothes.  In a shadowy area behind the stool van Eyck worked a glaze with his fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The play of light over the many different textures in the painting is brilliantly rendered, and the illusionistic detail, especially in Gabriel's rich costume, is exceptional.

Apart from several small changes in the position of hands and faces, the under-drawing shows that the small pilasters on the left wall were originally planned to be repeated on the rear wall, and to be much taller, reaching nearly to the roof, on both.  The paint on the rear wall is thicker than on the left wall, so he may have painted the pilasters before changing his mind.  In the underdrawing the ceiling planks are all in place, and there was also a light source to the right, for which the shadows are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford pp 2 &amp; 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative scenes on the tiles replace a simpler decorative plan in the underdrawing, and the stool has become much larger. The vase of lilies was not only absent in the underdrawing, but was not reserved, that is to say that a space was not left for it in the paint for the Virgin's robe or the floor.  This suggests it was only added late in the course of painting.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford pp 4 &amp; 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Examination of other major van Eyck works reveals similar developments from the underdrawing, and in the course of painting, in these works.  It seems van Eyck, perhaps acting with clerical advisers, although he appears to have been a considerable reader himself, liked to add further complexity to his compositions in the course of work on them.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition and date==
The painting was transferred from panel to canvas in the 19th century. It received a major cleaning in 1998, when varnish and some overpaint was removed, and a technical study undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, p1&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing before this, the NGA catalogue described the painting as extensively restored.  Craquelure (fine cracking to the surface) had been painted over, especially in the background.  Repainted areas included parts of Gabriel's face and hair, and the Virgin's robe, which appeared to have also lost a layer of glaze.&lt;ref&gt;Hand, p76&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of dates given for the painting was previously from 1428-29 (Panofsky and others) to 1436-37, but the discovery in 1959 of a date of 1437 on an altarpiece in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]], [[Dresden]] has considerably changed all van Eyck dating, and "makes it all but impossible to continue dating the ''Annunciation'' before 1432" (Hand).  The painting appears stylistically to come between the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] and late works such as the Berlin ''Virgin in a church''.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

Two authorities have considered the painting to belong to Jan's brother [[Hubert van Eyck]], who died in 1426.  It is thought that the recent cleaning or technical investigation has tended to confirm the majority view that it is an autograph work by Jan.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.82, Gifford p.1 on the recent work on the painting&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The [[provenance]] of the painting, as far as it is known, is:&lt;ref&gt;unless otherwise stated, Hand, 1986, p.76 &amp; notes&lt;/ref&gt;
*1791 - A visitor to the [[Chartreuse de Champmol]], a [[Carthusian]] monastery in [[Dijon]], now in France, but in the 15th century the capital of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], recorded seeing in the [[Prior]]'s room paintings, originally in the ducal chapel of the monastery: "... paintings on wood of the type of the earliest Flemish painters, which come from the chapels of the Dukes; they are about four feet high. The first, about a foot wide, is an Annunciation..."  The monastery was very largely destroyed in the French Revolution, but had been the burial place of the Dukes of Burgundy, and contained many important works.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Well of Moses'' by [[Claus Sluter]] remains ''in situ'', a Crucifixion by [[Jean Malouel]] of ca. 1398 is in the [[Louvre]]. The Broederlam altarpiece also came from the monastery.&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting mentioned is thought likely to be the Washington painting, although the measurements (in the French ''pied'', or ''foot'', of the period) do not match very exactly.   
*1817 - Bought at an auction sale in Paris by the major dealer C.J. Nieuwenhuys of Brussels, who sold it to [[William II, King of the Netherlands]]. In Brussels until 1841, then in The Hague. In a book of 1843 Nieuwenhuys says of the picture that it was "from a set with two others by the same master, painted for [[Philip the Good]] and destined to adorn a religious foundation in Dijon". A modern scholar has also claimed that the Virgin has the features of Philip's Duchess [[Isabella of Portugal]].   
*1850 - Lot 1 in an auction in The Hague, bought by Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] for the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].  Probably between 1864 and 1870 the Hermitage transferred it to canvas, as is often done with [[panel painting]]s when the wood develops problems. 
*1929 - Franz Matthiesen, a young German art dealer, was asked by the Soviet Government to compile a list of the hundred paintings in Russian collections which should never be sold under any circumstances. He was most surprised to be shown several of these paintings not long after in Paris by [[Calouste Gulbenkian]], who had traded them with the Russians for oil.  Gulbenkian wanted him to act as his agent on further purchases, but Matthiesen instead [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings|formed a consortium]] with [[Colnaghi]]'s of London and [[Knoedler]] &amp; Co of New York, which in 1930 and 1931 bought paintings and other works from the Russians, of which [[List of original Hermitage paintings in the National Gallery of Art|twenty-one paintings]] were bought by [[Andrew Mellon]], who had been offered first refusal. All are now in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, where they form some of the most important paintings in the collection (two works by Raphael, also including works by Botticelli, Titian, Veronese, Velázquez, Rembrandt).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 1964, pp 24-6&lt;/ref&gt;    
*1930 - Bought by Andrew Mellon via the consortium described above. In 1931 it was deeded to the [[Mellon Trust]], which gifted it in 1937 to the National Gallery of Art, whose construction began in that year.&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Annunciation - Provenance |url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.46.html#provenance |website=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trust fund"&gt;{{cite web |title=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8899">'''Capitalist Piglet''' was a comic strip which appeared briefly in ''[[The Sheaf]]'' during 2005–2006, and is best known for a controversial installment depicting [[Jesus Christ]] performing [[fellatio]] on a cartoon [[pig]].

==Creation==
The strip was a collaboration between cartoonist Mark Watson (aka Marq)&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdwatson.blogspot.com/ Mark Watson blog]&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeff MacDonald (aka Y!ph) &lt;ref&gt;[http://profile.myspace.com/30070336 MacDonald on myspace]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared infrequently in [[The Sheaf]], the [[University of Saskatchewan]] students' newspaper.

==Controversy==
===Background===
In the February 22, 2006, issue of ''The Sheaf'', pages B1-B4 of the issue were devoted to several lengthy opinion articles and letters addressing the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;Will Robbins,  [http://thesheaf.com/pdf97/Sheaf20060223web_B.pdf "Examining the issues behind the cartoon controversy"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820125149/http://thesheaf.com/pdf97/Sheaf20060223web_B.pdf |date=August 20, 2008 }}, ''The Sheaf'', 23 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sheaf'' [[editor-in-chief]], Will Robbins, wrote a 1,000-word editorial prefacing the other opinions outlining the reasons behind ''The Sheaf'''s editorial decision not to publish any of the controversial cartoons. Robbins also indicated that the decision not to publish any of the cartoons was not unanimous among the editorial staff. Indeed, in response to this decision ''The Sheaf'' news editor, Jeremy Warren, resigned from the paper. The nuanced journalistic position Robbins staked for ''The Sheaf'' was brought into question just one week later by the appearance of a controversial instalment of the Capitalist Piglet cartoon.

===The March 2 issue===
In the March 2, 2006, issue of ''The Sheaf'', a two-panel installment of the comic strip appeared in the paper's "Comics and Humour" section depicting a [[caricature]] of [[Jesus]] performing fellatio on a top-hatted, monocle-wearing "Capitalist Piglet". The second panel includes the pig saying "It's Kosher if you don't swallow."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smalldeadanimals.com/archives/003630.html&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon therefore appears to imply that [[Christianity]] is a tool of [[Capitalism]].

The comic had been scanned and laid-out into the newspaper's publication software by the graphics editor. The editor-in-chief reviewed the first draft of the paper and marked the Capitalist Piglet comic for deletion from the issue. It is in dispute whether or not he also verbally instructed the graphics editor to remove it or not; regardless the comic was not removed. The issue went through several more revisions before going to print without the offending comic being withdrawn. The editor-in-chief later claimed this was a mistake and due in part to a staff shortage (ostensibly aggravated by the above-mentioned resignation of the news editor).&lt;ref name=NotSorry&gt;Jason Warick, [http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/story.html?id=1f051b84-393a-4a3d-918e-61e745c2c354&amp;k=5901 "Sheaf cartoonist not sorry for uproar"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713064100/http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/story.html?id=1f051b84-393a-4a3d-918e-61e745c2c354&amp;k=5901 |date=July 13, 2010 |url2=https://archive.is/20120722123154/http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/story.html?id=1f051b84-393a-4a3d-918e-61e745c2c354&amp;k=5901 |date2=2012-07-22}}, ''The StarPhoenix'', 10 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fedio&gt;Chloé Fedio[http://ubyssey.bc.ca/OldWebs/2006/20060310/%3C!--4--%3ENational/11.html "U of S student paper on defensive after publishing Jesus comic"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''The Gateway/University of Alberta, 10 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In a retraction posted on page A2 of the March 9, 2006, issue, ''The Sheaf'' stated that Mark Watson was not an author of the March 2, 2006, Capitalist Piglet cartoon. In a letter appearing in that same issue, Mark Watson explained that his colleague, Y!ph, added his name to the installment "because he was using my character".&lt;ref&gt;Editorial staff, [http://thesheaf.com/pdf97/Sheaf20060309web_A.pdf Editorial] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829101538/http://thesheaf.com/pdf97/Sheaf20060309web_A.pdf |date=August 29, 2008 }}, ''The Sheaf'', 9 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the same issue, Jeff MacDonald accepted full responsibility for authoring the comic.

===Public reaction===
On March 3, 2006, [[University of Saskatchewan]] President [[Peter MacKinnon]] distributed an e-mail to all university staff and students calling on ''The Sheaf'' to apologize.

The Saskatoon daily newspaper, ''[[The StarPhoenix]]'', published several stories about the incident, beginning on March 11, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Janet French, [http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/story.html?id=99d5b011-144a-4d32-8f18-c0f46174b468&amp;k=98990 "Cartoon spurs anger"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506200107/http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/story.html?id=99d5b011-144a-4d32-8f18-c0f46174b468&amp;k=98990 |date=May 6, 2008 }}, ''The StarPhoenix'', 7 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NotSorry /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet French, [http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/story.html?id=1f051b84-393a-4a3d-918e-61e745c2c354&amp;k=5901 "Cartoons trip up Saskatoon student paper"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713064100/http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/story.html?id=1f051b84-393a-4a3d-918e-61e745c2c354&amp;k=5901 |date=July 13, 2010 }}, canada.com, 11 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Rawlco]] radio stations also picked up the story, in particular its Saskatchewan AM Radio Talk News stations [[CKOM]] and [[CJME]]. Morning talk-show personality, and former [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] Member of Parliament, [[John Kenneth Gormley|John Gormley]], called on listeners to file a complaint with the [[Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission]].

The comic was reported by other media, including the local [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] station. It gathered national media attention as well, and was heavily debated on many blogs, including the popular Saskatchewan blog [[Small Dead Animals]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.smalldeadanimals.com/archives/003630.html "Freedom From Responsibility"], [[Small Dead Animals]], 6 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian University Press]] also ran a wire story detailing the situation.&lt;ref name=Fedio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Lilly, [https://www.fraserinstitute.org/Commerce.Web/product_files/Lilly%20Levant.pdf "Courting Controversy - Ezra Levant and the Danish cartoons] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111231855/https://www.fraserinstitute.org/Commerce.Web/product_files/Lilly%20Levant.pdf |date=November 11, 2007 }} ''Canadian Student Review'', Spring 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous letters, both supporting and attacking ''The Sheaf'' were published in its subsequent March 9, 2006, issue on pages A11-A15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesheaf.com/pdf97/Sheaf20060309web_A.pdf Letters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829101538/http://thesheaf.com/pdf97/Sheaf20060309web_A.pdf |date=August 29, 2008 }}, ''The Sheaf'', 9 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions by ''The Sheaf''===
Shortly after the March 2 edition came out in print, the "Comics and Humour" section - including the offending comic - was removed from ''The Sheaf'''s online version.

According to Robbins' comments in a ''Star Phoenix'' article, he was invited to a Sunday meeting at ''The Sheaf'' and informed that all the other staff and editors had lost confidence in his ability to manage the paper and asked him to resign.&lt;ref name=NotSorry/&gt;{{rp|p. 2}} Reluctantly Robbins resigned. Despite many letters of support for Robbins,&lt;ref&gt;[http://supportthesheaf.blogspot.com/ Support the Sheaf blog]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sheaf'' Board of Directors accepted his resignation and appointed the production manager, Liam Richards, interim editor-in-chief and primary spokesperson during the controversy. In a press release, ''The Sheaf'' Board of Directors stated that "while the board is of the view that the 'Capitalist Piglet' comic is not consistent with ''The Sheaf'''s objectives, nor its previous editorial policy, we wish to make clear that our acceptance of his resignation was based primarily on his failure to carry out his duties diligently."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imprint.uwaterloo.ca/legacy/story.php?f%3D2%26t%3D8341%26i%3D%26v%3Df%26story%3D8341%26 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009120246/http://imprint.uwaterloo.ca/legacy/story.php?f=2&amp;t=8341&amp;i=&amp;v=f&amp;story=8341&amp; |archivedate=2006-10-09 |df= }} ''Imprint'' &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Croatian National Theatre Ivan pl. Zajc in Rijeka''' (Croatian: Hrvatsko narodno kazalište Ivana pl. Zajca Rijeka), commonly referred to as '''HNK Zajc''', is a theatre, opera and ballet house located in Rijeka.

==Overview==
The theater tradition in Rijeka is longer than two centuries. The first theater building in this city was erected in 1765, but at the end of the 18th century the construction of the new theater began, which opened in 1805 by renowned Rijeka citizen and trader [[Andrea Lodovico Adamich]]. Over the next eighty years the theater life in Rijeka took place in Theater Adamich, filled mostly by performances of Italian and less by German opera and drama groups. However, in the late 19th century several European theaters struck a fire, and in all the cities of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] began to take safety precautions, and Adamich Theatre did not meet the necessary conditions for normal operation. Rijeka municipal dealership decided to demolish the existing theater and build a brand new, modern and contemporary theater to suit Central European standards. In 1883 Rijeka city government, led by the famous mayor [[Giovanni Ciotti]], the grandson of another legendary Lodovico Adamich, decided to raise a grand new theater building of Rijeka. It was decided that the theater will be built on what was then a vast Ürmeny square. The project was commissioned in Vienna, in a specialized studio for theater, with architects [[Herman Helmer]] and [[Ferdinand Fellner]].&lt;ref name="hnk-zajc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnk-zajc.hr/o-kazalistu/povijest-kazalista/ |title=» Povijest kazališta |publisher=Hnk-zajc.hr |date= |accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years of construction, the opening day of the new Municipal Theatre (Teatro Comunale) was on October 3, 1885. For this occasion, two great operas never before performed were prepared. They were [[Verdi's]] [[Aida]] and [[Ponchielli|Ponchielli's]] [[Gioconda]]. On that day, the first visitors, numerous guests and invitees could enjoy the impressive theater building, a masterpiece of architecture of his time, whose figural plastic and ornamental work contributed by the famous [[Venice|Venetian]] sculptor [[August Benvenuti]] and ceiling paintings painter [[Franz Matsch]] in cooperation with even more famous brothers, [[Ernst Klimt|Ernst]] and [[Gustav Klimt]].&lt;ref name="hnk-zajc1"/&gt;

In its rich history theater in Rijeka changed its name several times. After the Municipal (Teatro Comunale), the Theatre was renamed, in 1913, to Teatro Verdi. However, do to historical and political circumstances (the city of Rijeka, at the time known as Fiume, became a [[Free State of Fiume|Free State]] before [[Treaty of Rome (1924)|passing to the Kingdom of Italy]] in 1924) the [[Croatian language]] and Croatian theater artists did not have access to the theater at all until the end of 1945 when, following the example of similar permanent national domestic and foreign theatrical institutions established permanent National Theatre in Rijeka, the Croatian drama, Italian drama and opera and ballet. On October 20, 1946, after passing to [[Yugoslavia]], a show played on its stage in the Croatian language for the first time. It was [[Ivan Gundulić]]'s ''Dubravka'', directed by Dr. [[Matko Foteza]] with [[Marija Crnobori]] in the role of Dubravka. It was soon followed by the first performance of an opera and ballet, [[Ivan Zajc|Zajc's]] [[Nikola Šubić Zrinski (opera)|Nikola Subic Zrinjski]], conducted by [[Boris Papandopulo]], and the title role sung [[Milan Pichler]]. The first play of the Italian drama was [[Carlo Goldoni|Goldoni's]] ''[[List of works by Carlo Goldoni|Il burbero benefico]]''.
In the year 1953 the theater gets a new name after another one composer, but this time the biggest Croatian and a fellow citizen of Rijeka, Ivan Zajc.&lt;ref name="hnk-zajc1"/&gt;

Since 1991 theater got the status of national theater, and in 1994 its present name, Croatian National Theatre Ivan pl. Zajc. From the historical 1946 to today, with its four artistic branches (Croatian Drama, Italian Drama, the Symphonic Opera and ballet) and more than 50 years of their continuous operation, with its quality performance HNK in Rijeka managed to set high theatrical and artistic criteria and placed itself on the rightful place of one of the by quality leading theaters in Croatia. At the same time, his repertoire today is characterized by performances of drama, opera and ballet classics as well as works of Croatian dramatic and operatic heritage and also first performances of the national acts, especially contemporary.&lt;ref name="hnk-zajc1"/&gt;

All the major Croatian theaters were built in the second half of the 19th century, including the one in Rijeka - behind [[Osijek]] (1865), and before [[Split, Croatia|Split]] (1893) and [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Zagreb]] (1895).&lt;ref name="hnk-zajc1"/&gt;

[[File:De Balneis Puteolanis MS 1474 Biblioteca Angelica de Rome 3.jpg|thumb|Illumination from ''De balneis Puteolanis'' -late 13th century manuscript, MS 1474, [[Biblioteca Angelica]] in Rome]]

'''''De balneis Puteolanis''''' ("On the baths of Pozzuoli") is a medieval didactic poem in Latin, attributed to [[Peter of Eboli]], describing the thermal baths of [[Pozzuoli]] in the [[Campi Flegrei]] region of [[Campania]]. The poem has the alternative title '''''De balneis terrae laboris'''''.

The poem in thirty-five epigrams was written in the last decade of the twelfth century, probably in 1197. It is dedicated to the emperor ("Cesaris ad laudem"), probably [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The author "reports every detail about more than thirty different thermal sites in the Campi Flegrei, including all therapeutic effects of their waters."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15293539 Mezzogiorno et al. (2004). "Pietro Anzolino da Eboli and the thermal therapy of renal pathologies". J Nephrol. 2004 Mar-Apr;17(2):329-33. PMID: 15293539.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The attribution to [[Peter of Eboli]] ''(Petrus de Ebulo)'' is generally made "with some certainty", although some historians associate it with the work of Sicilian physician [[Alcadino di Siracusa]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulvio Delle Donne, [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/pietro-da-eboli_(Federiciana)/ "Pietro da Eboli"], ''Enciclopedia Federiciana'', Vol. II, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani&lt;/ref&gt;

''De balneis Puteolanis'' was popular in its time and survives in a number of manuscript versions. It was also translated into vernacular languages and was issued in 12 editions in print, from 1457 to 1607.

Many surviving manuscript versions are especially notable for their accompanying illustrations of medieval [[bathing]].

Many of the thermal baths described in the Pozzuoli region were destroyed in the 1538 volcanic eruption which transformed the landscape of the Campi Flegrei caldera and created [[Monte Nuovo]].

'''Defamiliarization''' or '''''ostranenie''''' ({{lang-rus|остранение|p=ɐstrɐˈnʲenʲɪjə}}) is the [[art]]istic technique of presenting to audiences common things in an unfamiliar or strange way &lt;!--typically (is it also used for other rasons / without an explicit intention?)--&gt;in order to enhance perception of the familiar.

== History ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
According to (De Guzman, 2016), Defamiliarization of that which is or has become familiar or taken for granted, hence automatically perceived, is the basic function of all devices. And with defamiliarization come both the slowing down and the increased difficulty (impeding) of the process of reading and comprehending and an awareness of the artistic procedures (devices) causing them.  (Margolin 2005)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "defamiliarization" was first coined in 1917 by [[Viktor Shklovsky]] in his essay "Art as Device" (alternate translation: "Art as Technique") (Crawford 209).  Shklovsky invented the term as a means to "distinguish poetic from practical language on the basis of the former's perceptibility" (Crawford 209).  Essentially, he is stating that [[poetic language]] is fundamentally different than the language that we use every day because it is more difficult to understand:  "Poetic speech is ''formed speech''.  [[Prose]] is ordinary speech – economical, easy, proper, the goddess of prose [''dea prosae''] is a goddess of the accurate, facile type, of the "direct" expression of a child" (Shklovsky 20).  This difference is the key to the creation of art and the prevention of "over-automatization," which causes an individual to "function as though by formula" (Shklovsky 16).  This distinction between artistic language and everyday language, for Shklovsky, applies to all artistic forms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known.  The technique of art is to make objects ‘unfamiliar,' to make forms difficult to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged. (Shklovsky 16) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus, defamiliarization serves as a means to force individuals to recognize artistic language:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In studying poetic speech in its phonetic and [[Word|lexical]] structure as well as in its characteristic distribution of words and in the characteristic thought structures compounded from the words, we find everywhere the artistic trademark – that is, we find material obviously created to remove the automatism of perception; the author's purpose is to create the vision which results from that deautomatized perception.  A work is created "artistically" so that its perception is impeded and the greatest possible effect is produced through the slowness of the perception.  (Shklovsky 19)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This technique is meant to be especially useful in distinguishing poetry from prose, for, as [[Aristotle]] said, "poetic language must appear strange and wonderful" (Shklovsky 19).

=== In Russian literature ===

To illustrate what he means by defamiliarization, Shklovsky uses examples from [[Tolstoy]], whom he cites as using the technique throughout his works: "The narrator of '[[Kholstomer]],' for example, is a horse, and it is the horse's point of view (rather than a person's) that makes the content of the story seem unfamiliar" (Shklovsky 16).  As a Russian Formalist, many of Shklovsky's examples use Russian authors and Russian dialects: "And currently [[Maxim Gorky]] is changing his diction from the old literary language to the new literary colloquialism of [[Nikolai Leskov|Leskov]].  Ordinary speech and literary language have thereby changed places (see the work of [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and many others)" (Shklovsky 19-20).

Defamiliarization also includes the use of foreign languages within a work.  At the time that Shklovsky was writing, there was a change in the use of language in both [[literature]] and everyday spoken Russian.  As Shklovsky puts it: "Russian literary language, which was originally foreign to [[Russia]], has so permeated the language of the people that it has blended with their conversation.  On the other hand, literature has now begun to show a tendency towards the use of dialects and/or barbarisms" (Shklovsky 19).

=== Différance ===

Shklovsky's defamiliarization can also be compared to [[Jacques Derrida]]'s concept of [[différance]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What Shklovskij wants to show is that the operation of defamiliarization and its consequent perception in the literary system is like the winding of a watch (the introduction of energy into a physical system): both "originate" difference, change, value, motion, presence.  Considered against the general and functional background of Derridian différance, what Shklovskij calls "perception" can be considered a matrix for production of difference.  (Crawford 212) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since the term différance refers to the dual meanings of the [[French language|French]] word difference to mean both "to differ" and "to defer", defamiliarization draws attention to the use of common language in such a way as to alter one's perception of an easily understandable object or concept.  The use of defamiliarization both differs and defers, since the use of the technique alters one's perception of a concept (to defer), and forces one to think about the concept in different, often more complex, terms (to differ).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shklovskij's formulations negate or cancel out the existence/possibility of a "real" perception: variously, by (1) the familiar Formalist denial of a link between literature and life, connoting their status as non-communicating vessels, (2) always, as if compulsively, referring to a real experience in terms of empty, dead, and automatized repetition and recognition, and (3) implicitly locating real perception at an unspecifiable temporally anterior and spatially other place, at a mythic "first time" of naïve experience, the loss of which to automatization is  to be restored by aesthetic perceptual fullness. (Crawford 218)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Uncanny ===

The influence of Russian Formalism on twentieth-century art and culture is largely due to the literary technique of defamiliarization or ‘making strange’, and has also been linked to Freud’s notion of the uncanny.&lt;ref&gt;Royle, Nicholas.  ''The Uncanny''.  New York: Routledge, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Das Unheimliche'' ("The Uncanny"),&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund.  ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Volume XVII.  Ed. James Strachey.  London: Hogarth Press, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud states that “the uncanny is that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar,” however, this is not a fear of the unknown, but more of a feeling about something being both strange and familiar (220).  The connection between ''ostranenie'' and the uncanny can be seen where Freud muses on the technique of literary uncanniness: “It is true that the writer creates a kind of uncertainty in us in the beginning by not letting us know, no doubt purposely, whether he is taking us into the real world or into a purely fantastic one of his own creation” (230).  When “the writer pretends to move in the world of common reality,” they can situate supernatural events, such as the animation of inanimate objects, in the quotidian, day-to-day reality of the modern world, defamiliarizing the reader and provoking an uncanny feeling (250).

== Usage ==
The technique appears in English Romantic poetry, particularly in the poetry of [[Wordsworth]], and was defined in the following way by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'': "To carry on the feelings of childhood into the powers of manhood; to combine the child's sense of wonder and novelty with the appearances which every day for perhaps forty years had rendered familiar ... this is the character and privilege of genius." 
 
In more recent times, it has been associated with the poet and playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]], whose [[Verfremdungseffekt]] ("estrangement effect") was a potent element of his approach to theater. In fact, as Willett points out, Verfremdungseffekt is "a translation of the Russian critic Viktor Shklovskij's phrase 'Priem Ostranenija', or 'device for making strange'".&lt;ref&gt;(Willett, John.  ''Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic''.  New York: Hill and Wang, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht, in turn, has been highly influential for artists and filmmakers including Jean-Luc Godard and Yvonne Rainer.

'''''Family of Saltimbanques''''' (''{{lang|fr|La famille de saltimbanques}}'') is a 1905 painting by [[Pablo Picasso]]. The work depicts six [[:wikt:saltimbanco|saltimbanques]], a kind of itinerant [[circus performer]], in a desolate landscape.

It is considered the masterpiece of [[Picasso's Rose Period]], sometimes called his circus period.&lt;ref name="ngaguide"&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/picteach.shtm Picasso: The Early Years, 1892–1906.] [[National Gallery of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and composition==
It was painted during a period from late 1904 to early 1906 when Picasso explored themes using the saltimbanque. Picasso frequently attended the [[Cirque Médrano]] in [[Montmartre]].

The composition groups the saltimbanques together but they seem disconnected and do not look at one another.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;Staff report (October 13, 1947). Picasso: The brilliant Spaniard is this era's most important painter. But is he a truly great artist? ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Critics have suggested ''Family of Saltimbanques'' is a covert group portrait of Picasso and his circle, symbolized as poor, independent and isolated. The painting was removed from the Spanish salon at the [[IX Biennale of Venice]] in 1910, because considered inappropriate by the organization. &lt;ref name=""&gt;Carmean E. A. (1970). ''Picasso, The saltimbanques.'' [[National Gallery of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohemian–Austrian poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] (1875–1926) was inspired by this painting as he wrote the fifth of ten elegies in his ''[[Duino Elegies]]'' (1923).  Rilke used the figures in Picasso's painting as a symbol of "human activity ... always travelling and with no fixed abode, they are even a shade more fleeting than the rest of us, whose fleetingness was lamented." Further, although Picasso's painting depicts the figures in a desolate desert landscape,  Rilke described them as standing on a "threadbare carpet" to suggest "the ultimate loneliness and isolation of Man in this incomprehensible world, practicing their profession from childhood to death as playthings of an unknown will...before their 'pure too-little; had passed into 'empty too-much'."&lt;ref&gt;Leishman, J. B.; and Spender, Stephen. ''Rainer Maria Rilke: Duino Elegies'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1939) 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related work in [[gouache]] and [[pastel]] is ''Family of Acrobats'' (1905).&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.picasso-paintings.org/family-of-acrobats-study-1905-by-pablo-picasso/ Picasso-paintings.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fougère Royale by Paul Parquet - Bottle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An original bottle of ''Fougère Royale'' by [[Houbigant Parfum|Houbigant]], created by the perfumer [[Paul Parquet]] in 1882.&lt;ref name=Houbigant/&gt;]]
[[File:sa-fern.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fougère means "[[fern]]" in [[French language|French]] ]]

'''''Fougère''''', {{IPA-fr|fu.ʒɛʁ|pron}}, is one of the main [[Perfume#Olfactive families|olfactive families]] of [[perfume]]s. The name comes from the [[French language]] word for "[[fern]]". ''Fougère'' perfumes are made with a blend of fragrances: [[Note (perfumery)|top-notes]] are sweet, with the scent of [[lavender]] flowers; as the more [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] components evaporate, the scents of [[oakmoss]], derived from a species of [[lichen]] and described as woody, sharp and slightly sweet, and [[coumarin]], similar to the scent of new-mown [[hay]], become noticeable. Aromatic ''fougère'', a derivative of this class, contains additional notes of herbs, spice and/or wood.&lt;ref name=Fragrantica&gt;{{cite web|title=Aromatic Fougere|url=http://www.fragrantica.com/groups/aromatic+fougere.html|website=Fragrantica.com perfumes magazine|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name originated with [[Houbigant Parfum]]'s ''Fougère Royale''. This perfume, created by Houbigant owner [[Paul Parquet]], was later added to the scent archives known as the [[Osmothèque]], in [[Versailles, France]].&lt;ref name=Houbigant&gt;{{cite web|title=Fougère Royale|url=https://www.houbigant-parfum.com/us_en/fougere-royale.html|website=Parfums Houbigant Paris|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houbigant re-introduced this fragrance in 2010.&lt;ref name=Fragrantica/&gt;

Perfumes of this type are especially popular as fragrances for men.&lt;ref name=Houbigant/&gt; Many modern fougère perfumes have various citrus, herbaceous, green, floral and animalic notes included. The most common additions to the basic fragrance blend include [[vetiver]] and [[pelargonium|geranium]]. [[Bergamot orange|Bergamot]] is often present to add sharpness to the lavender top-note.

Examples of men's fragrances which fall into the ''fougère'' class include [[Brut (cologne)|Brut]] by [[Fabergé (cosmetics)|Fabergé]], [[Paco Rabanne]] Pour Homme, Azzaro Pour Homme, Boss by [[Hugo Boss (fashion designer)|Hugo Boss]], [[Prada]] for Men, [[Eternity (fragrance)|Eternity for Men]] by [[Calvin Klein]], Canoe for Men by Dana, [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] Pour Homme, [[Drakkar Noir]] by [[Guy Laroche]], [[Tabac (perfume)|Tabac]] for Men, Michael for Men by [[Michael Kors]], Clubman Pinaud After Shave and Special Reserve, Polo Blue and Chaps by [[Ralph Lauren]], and [[Kouros (perfume)|Kouros]] by [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]].&lt;ref name=Houbigant/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fragrantica/&gt;

{{chaos magic}}The '''Illuminates of Thanateros''' (pronounced ĭ-'lū-mə-,nĭts ŭv ,thăn-ə-'târ-ōs) is an international [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] organization that focuses on practical group work in [[chaos magic]]. The idea was first announced in 1978, while the order proper was formed in 1987. This [[fraternity|fraternal]] magical society has been an important influence on some forms of modern [[occultism]].

==Name==
The name "Thanateros" is a combination of the names "[[Thanatos]]" and "[[Eros]]"— the Greek gods of death and sex, respectively. The idea is that sex and death represent the positive and negative methods of attaining "magical consciousness". The word "Illuminates" is used in accordance with the claimed tradition of calling such societies — in which those who have mastered the secrets of magic help bring others to mastership — "the [[Illuminati]]".

Its formal name is The Magical Pact of the Illuminates of Thanateros,&lt;ref name=greer&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Encyclopedia of The Occult |author=Greer, John Michael |page=240 |publisher=[[Llewellyn Worldwide]] |year=2003 |isbn=1-56718-336-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is usually shortened to "the Pact".

==History==

===Early===
In the late 1970s, [[Ray Sherwin]] and [[Peter J. Carroll|Peter Carroll]], two young [[United Kingdom|British]] occultists with a strong interest in [[ritual magic]], began to publish a magazine called ''[[The New Equinox]]''. Both were connected with a burgeoning occult scene developing around a metaphysical bookshop in [[London]]'s [[East End of London|East End]] called The Phoenix. Both men quickly became dissatisfied with the state of the magical arts and the deficiencies they saw in the available occult groups. So in 1978 they published a small announcement in their magazine proclaiming the creation of a new kind of magical order, one based on a hierarchy of magical ability rather than invitation, a magical [[meritocracy]]. They described it as a "spiritual heir" to the [[Zos Kia Cultus]] and a "fusion of [[Thelema|Thelemic]] Magick, [[Tantra]], The Sorceries of Zos and [[Tao]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New Equinox]]'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Carroll and Sherwin began to publish private monographs detailing their system of magical practice, some of which had been articles in ''The New Equinox'', others intended as instruction to members of their order. The new style of magic they introduced, focusing on practical skills as opposed to metaphysical systems, became known as [[chaos magic]]. In the 1980s they began to attract a following in [[England]], Germany, and Austria, including influential occult writers and practitioners.

In 1980, Peter Carroll and Frater Vegtan formed The Church of Chaos in [[Sydney]], Australia. It was, in style, what the IOT would become. The group was active for six months. In 1984 The Circle of Chaos was formed, but began to fragment after three years. In 1986 Carroll and [[Ralph Tegtmeier]] (Frater U∴D∴) jointly ran a public seminar, some time after which there was made a decision to form a new magical order. The formation of The Pact was announced in August 1987.

In late 1980s, Sherwin resigned in protest that the IOT was beginning to resemble the hierarchical orders that were once anathema to the concept of the group.

===The Ice Magick Wars===
In the early 1990s the order experienced a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] as a result of conflicts about the doctrine of 'ice magick',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Blood of the Saints |author=[[Alan Chapman (writer)|Chapman, Alan]] |author2=[[Duncan Barford|Barford, Duncan]]  |publisher=Heptarchia Press |year=2009 |isbn=0-9563321-0-2 |pages=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; a major proponent of which was [[Ralph Tegtmeier]].&lt;ref name=icewar&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ice War |author=Peter J. Carroll ("Stokastikos") |publisher=''[[Chaos International]]'' 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German IoT member named Helmut Barthel created the doctrine of 'ice magick', which is related to the myth that Germanic people originated in the icy land of [[Thule]] (a name that has historicly been applied to multiple places, which have been conflated together). Ice magick is called 'eismagie' in its original German form. According to the doctrine of ice magick, only people of Scandinavian and/or Germanic descent possess the ancient dormant genes that allow a person to use ice magick. Ice magick is based upon [[qi gong]], [[psionics]], and martial arts. It is called 'ice magick' because it also involves imagining large amounts of ice, and drawing power from that imagined ice. The ice magick training regimen that Helmut imposed was exceptionally difficult.

Ralph Tegtmeier (Frater U∴D∴) was an enthusiastic supporter of ice magick and Helmut, and the authoritarian policies that Helmut promoted, and Ralph thus made himself Helmut's top lieutenant. Helmut and Ralph promoted that doctrine in Germany, and recruited many members who adhered to it.

Eventually, Peter Carroll learned more about the doctrines that Ralph was teaching, and criticized him for it. That led to an untenable conflict between Peter and Ralph, which culminated in Ralph and all of his followers seceding from the IoT. The vast majority of German and Swiss members left the order, which constituted about 30% of the order's total membership.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Gerhard (2008). ''Arkane Welten: Biografien, Erfahrungen und Praktiken zeitgenössischer Magier''. Ergon Verlag. {{ISBN|978-3-89913-618-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Tegtmeier]] and a few others were subsequently [[excommunication|excommunicated]].&lt;ref name=icewar /&gt;

After publishing ''Liber Kaos'', Carroll retired from active participation in the order, though he remains on good terms with many of the longstanding members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Message 0 |url=http://specularium.org/index.php?option=com_blog&amp;view=comments&amp;pid=5&amp;Itemid=137 |author=Carroll, Peter J. |date=Dec 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714152429/http://specularium.org/index.php?option=com_blog&amp;view=comments&amp;pid=5&amp;Itemid=137 |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Structure==
The order organizes itself along the somewhat "traditional" lines of a fraternal occult order, with initiations into progressive degrees denoting magickal skill, administrative responsibility and leadership within the group. It is notable that unlike other occult societies with a degree system, the order rewards progression in degree with hardly any privileges, but "punishes" it with added duties and responsibilities.

Members are obliged to [[Confidentiality|keep silent on internal affairs and the identities of their fellows]]. The latter rule does not seem to apply to deceased persons, as it is not a secret [[William S. Burroughs]],&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Douglas. [http://www.ashejournal.com/index.php?id=166 Magick and Photography, Douglas Grant, ''Ashé Journal'' 2(3 Magick and Photography] in ''Ashé: Journal of Experimental Spirituality'', vol. 2, no. 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timothy Leary]],&lt;ref name="Shekinah"&gt;Fäustchen, Frater. "Für und wider Magie und Liber MMM" in [http://www.roterdrache.org/shekinah_1.html Shekinah] no. 1. {{ISBN|978-3-939459-11-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Anton Wilson]]&lt;ref name="Shekinah"/&gt; have been members.

==Relation to the occult subculture==
{{quote|Magic will not free itself from occultism until we have strangled the last astrologer with the guts of the last spiritual master.|Pete Carroll&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Peter. ''Psybermagick'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Chaos magicians have frequently reacted to more traditional, [[Neopaganism|religious]] or [[Occultism|occult]] approaches to magic with scorn or derision. This applies in particular to the IOT, which has been described by [[Phil Hine]] as "the Order for 'serious' Chaos Magicians in the same way that the OTO exists for 'serious' Thelemites."&lt;ref&gt;[[Phil Hine|Hine, Phil]]. ''[http://www.textfiles.com/occult/ERIS/cc.txt Condensed Chaos: An Introduction to Chaos Magic]''. New Falcon Publications. {{ISBN|1-56184-117-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgment that occultism is rife with superstitions and needs to be reformed or replaced by a bolder and more critical approach to magic has been prominent in programmatic texts from early on.  Still the IOT is commonly understood by outsiders to be an occult&lt;ref&gt;Greer, John Michael (2003).

Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|0-275-98712-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; organization.

The group has a comparatively difficult application procedure and appears to reject a great majority of applicants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} However, chaos magic has long spread beyond the IOT as evidenced by the large community of practitioners throughout the world. IOT members such as [[Ramsey Dukes]], Dave Lee, Julian Vayne, and many others continue to produce a large part of the literature available as regards chaos magic. Other sources of chaos magic literature include [[Kenneth Grant]] and Jaq D. Hawkins.&lt;ref&gt;Jaq D. Hawkins: Understanding Chaos Magic. Cappall Bann Publishing, 1994. {{ISBN|1898307 938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of [[hierarchy]] in the IOT has been the cause of a lot of dispute around it in the chaos magic scene. Opposers think the concept is un-chaotic and limiting to individual members, while defenders believe the tradeoff in chaoism allows for much more effective group work, especially on an international scale.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Image:Kanteletar.jpg|thumb|180px|''Kanteletar taikka Suomen Kansan Wanhoja Lauluja ja Wirsiä'']]

'''''Kanteletar''''' is a collection of [[Culture of Finland|Finnish]] [[folk poetry]] compiled by [[Elias Lönnrot]]. It is considered to be a sister collection to the Finnish [[national epic]] ''[[Kalevala]]''. The poems of ''Kanteletar'' are based on the [[trochaic tetrameter]], generally referred to as "Kalevala metre".

The name consists of the base word ''[[kantele]]'' (a Finnish [[zither]]-like instrument) and the [[Grammatical gender|feminising]] [[morpheme]] ''-tar'' and can be roughly interpreted as "maiden of the kantele" or "zither-daughter", a kind of [[muse]].&lt;ref&gt;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Kanteletar/Keith-Bosley/e/9780192828620&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

''Kanteletar'' was published in 1840 under the name ''Kanteletar taikka Suomen Kansan Wanhoja Lauluja ja Wirsiä'' (''"Kanteletar or Old Songs and Hymns of the Finnish People"''). Lönnrot got the foundation for the collection on his journeys in 1838 after he met rune singer Mateli Kuivalatar on the banks of the [[Koitere]]. The poems sung by Kuivalatar were recorded in Lönnrot's notes.

''Kanteletar'' consists of three books. The first book includes 238 lyrical poems which Lönnrot named ''Yhteisiä Lauluja'' or "Common Songs". These songs are divided into four sections: common themes, for a wedding crowd, [[shepherd]]s, and children. The second book contains 354 lyrical poems which was called ''Erityisiä Lauluja'' or "Special Songs". These songs are divided as songs for girls, women, boys and men. There are 60 historic poems, [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]], [[legend]]s, [[ballad]]s and lyrical [[epic poem]]s in the third book, which is called ''Virsi-Lauluja'' or "Hymns". There are 24 new poems in the [[preface]].

Lönnrot's third edition of ''Kanteletar'' in 1887 had the third book revised in full, as it contained 137 poems. Later editions adhered to the original printing with the exception of 10 poems which were taken from the third book as an [[Addendum|appendix]].

The lyrical poetry of ''Kanteletar'' comes, for the most part, from [[Finnish Karelia]]. In his forward, Lönnrot makes note of [[Lieksa]], [[Ilomantsi]], [[Kitee]], [[Tohmajärvi]], [[Sortavala]], [[Jaakkima]] and [[Kurkijoki]] as places where he traveled. The poems of the third book have generally been collected from Russia and [[Karelia]].

== Reception ==
[[Image:Velisurmaaja.jpg|200p|thumb|Akseli Gallen-Kallela: ''The Fratricide, 1897'']]

''Kanteletar'' and ''Kalevala'' has generally been used as a source of inspiration in [[the arts]]. They have been used as a source of lyrics for Finnish [[folk music]] in addition to archived Finnish folk poetry. The Kalevala-metred poems had originally been sung poetry.

=== Music ===

*[[Mari Kaasinen]] has explained that ''Kanteletar'' and ''Kalevala'' have been used as a source of inspiration for the music of [[Värttinä]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenmanreview.com/cd/interview_marikaasinen_0303.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927180112/http://greenmanreview.com/cd/interview_marikaasinen_0303.html |archivedate=2010-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the lyrics in the Värttinä song ''Niin mie mieltynen'' (The Beloved, Music: P. Lehti – Words: S. Reiman, trad.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Onpa tietty tietyssäni,&lt;br /&gt;
mesimarja mielessäni.&lt;br /&gt;
Lempilintu liitossani,&lt;br /&gt;
soriainen suojassani. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

are taken directly from the 31st poem of the second book. The name of the poem is ''Onpa tietty tietyssäni'' (I Am Thinking of a Particular One) and has been translated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
His image is fastened in my mind&lt;br /&gt;
My sweet one in my memory,&lt;br /&gt;
My little bird flies along with me&lt;br /&gt;
My dear one under my wing.&lt;ref&gt;http://varttina.com/main.site?action=siteupdate/view&amp;id=43 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717185307/http://varttina.com/main.site?action=siteupdate%2Fview&amp;id=43 |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Akseli Törnudd]] (1874–1923) had written about twenty songs based on ''Kanteletar'' poems, the most popular being perhaps the humorous story about a [[cat]] from [[Viipuri]] ''Tuomittu katti'' ("The Convicted Cat").
*The men's [[choir]] [[Viipurin Lauluveikot]], conducted by [[Urpo Rauhala]], put out the song for the album ''Yhä kohoaa tuttu torni'' and other songs were recorded for their collection ''Te luulette meidän unohtaneen'' in 2005.
*A cappella group [[Rajaton]] has recorded several songs with lyrics taken from ''Kanteletar''.
*''Kanteletar'' has been a source of inspiration for the lyrics of the [[choral]] works by [[Toivo Kuula]], [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Selim Palmgren]].
*In 1996, Finnish metal band [[Amorphis]] released their third album [[Elegy (Amorphis album)|Elegy]] based around the stories and poems within the Kanteletar.

=== Visual art ===

*In addition to his paintings inspired by ''Kalevala'', [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]] produced paintings based on ''Kanteletar'' in the late 19th century.

===Online literature===
*[[Project Gutenberg]] added ''Kanteletar'' to its [[e-book]] collection.

'''''Klat Magazine''''' is an independent publishing project launched at the end of 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klatmagazine.com/about KlatMagazine.com, About page]&lt;/ref&gt; in Milan, on the initiative of Paolo Priolo and Emanuela Carelli, with the aim of investigating the multifaceted space of contemporary art, design and architecture through a close encounter with its protagonists.

The name Klat comes from the word “talk” written back to front, and reflects the publishers’ desire to develop a new vocabulary and new ways of exchanging views on the subjects covered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exibart.com/notizia.asp?IDNotizia=30819&amp;IDCategoria=1 Exibart.com, Intervista a Paolo Priolo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief Summary==
The project started out as a quarterly print periodical made up solely of very long interviews, published in two languages (Italian and English) and distributed in fifteen different countries: Italy, Germany, Great Britain, France, Sweden, Belgium, Portugal, China, Hong Kong, Malta, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and the United States.

Between 2009 and 2011 five issues came out, containing a total of forty interviews with leading exponents of contemporary design and creativity, including [[Stefano Boeri]], [[Andrea Branzi]], [[Alfredo Jaar]], [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]], [[Francesco Vezzoli]], [[Rosa Barba]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Martino Gamper]], [[Maarten Baas]], [[John Maeda]], [[Oliviero Toscani]], [[Nigel Coates (architect)|Nigel Coates]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Martí Guixé]], [[Toyo Ito]], [[Jasper Morrison]], [[Peter Zumthor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klatmagazine.com/interviews/art-design-architecture-back-to-the-future-klat-interviews/6873 KlatMagazine.com, Back to the Future Klat Interviews]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the publishers decided to wind up the print version and turn the original idea into an online magazine that proposes a daily mix of viewpoints, conversations, images and opinions, broadening the field of inquiry to embrace architecture, contemporary art, design, photography, fashion and other forms of applied creativity.

''Klat Magazine'' is a publication registered at the Milan Tribunal (no. 197, April 24, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klatmagazine.com KlatMagazine.com, Footer]&lt;/ref&gt;  The editor-in-chief is Paolo Priolo.

'''''Lakeview Terrace''''' is a 2008 American [[crime film|crime]] [[thriller film]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/lakeview-terrace-v386281|work=Allmovie|accessdate=4 September 2012|author=Buchanan, Jason|title=Lakeview Terrace}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Neil LaBute]], written by [[David Loughery]] and [[Howard Korder]], and co-produced by [[Will Smith]], and starring [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] and [[Kerry Washington]]. Jackson plays a prejudiced [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] police officer who terrorizes his new next-door neighbors because they are an [[Interracial marriage|interracially married]] couple. The title is a reference to the ethnically-mixed middle class Los Angeles neighborhood of [[Lake View Terrace, Los Angeles|Lake View Terrace]]. The film was released on September 19, 2008, received mixed reviews and grossed $44 million.

==Plot==
An interracial newlywed couple, Chris and Lisa Mattson ([[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] and [[Kerry Washington]]) are moving into their first home. Chris’s first exchanges with their neighbor, widowed and longtime LAPD officer Abel Turner ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), have somewhat hostile undertones, with Abel making comments about Chris’ smoking (which Abel later exposes to Lisa) and listening to [[hip hop music]], and making remarks about his ethnicity in his interracial relationship to Lisa. The following night, Chris and Lisa have sex in their swimming pool. Unknown to them, Abel's children, Marcus and Celia, watch them. Abel arrives home and witnesses the spectacle. Angry, he re-positions his home security floodlights to shine into Chris and Lisa's window, keeping them awake. Abel begins to insinuate to Chris that he disapproves of his interracial marriage and that he wants them to move out of their new neighborhood. One evening, Chris and Lisa hear noises downstairs and find the tires on Chris' car slashed. Suspecting Abel, they call the police, who are unable to do anything because of Abel's status within the LAPD. Chris retaliates by shining his own floodlights into Abel's bedroom.

Lisa later reveals she is pregnant, creating conflict with Chris, who does not yet want children. Meanwhile, Abel is suspended without pay for abusing a suspect, inciting more fury within him. Abel continues his harassment of the couple by hosting a loud bachelor party with his colleagues where he forces Chris to be sexually harassed by a stripper. Chris later plants trees along the fence between their properties, which leads to a near-violent exchange, as Abel objects to having trees hanging over his property. When Chris goes to a local bar, Abel enters and tells Chris that his own wife died in a traffic accident because she was having an affair with a white man, and that he distrusts white men and is prejudiced against interracial relationships because of this.

Abel sends his informant, Clarence Darlington ([[Keith Loneker]]), to trash the Mattson's home in another effort to force them out. Lisa arrives home early, surprising Clarence. They struggle and Lisa is knocked out, but not before she triggers the alarm. Chris races home, followed by a frustrated Abel. When Abel comes upon his hired criminal, he fatally shoots him to keep him quiet. Lisa is rushed to the hospital, but is okay.

Wildfires are raging in the surrounding hills and the residents are instructed to leave their homes. Abel, who remains behind, enters the Mattsons' home, hoping to retrieve Clarence's dropped cell phone, fearing that it will incriminate him. Lisa and Chris unexpectedly return from the hospital before Abel finds the phone, and he leaves. While the Mattsons pack to evacuate, Chris finds the cell phone. He calls the last number dialed and hears Abel answer. Chris realizes Abel is responsible for the break-in, and Abel realizes Chris has discovered the phone.

Abel goes over with his gun drawn, and he and Chris struggle. Before Lisa can escape, Abel shoots her car, causing her to crash into a parked vehicle. After pistol whipping Abel and seemingly knocking him out, Chris rescues Lisa and holds Abel's other gun at him. Hiding his gun behind his back, Abel insists he is unarmed when county sheriff officers arrive on the scene and that Chris should listen to his wife after he is demanded by the officers to drop his gun. Chris finally throws Abel off by asking him about his wife's death and how she had become unfaithful to him, implying that she had done so because of his strictness. Infuriated, Abel finally pulls out his hidden gun, shooting Chris in the shoulder, prompting Abel to be killed by the deputies in self-defense. Chris survives and he and Lisa later talk about their pride in their home, neighborhood, and soon-to-be family, while the wildfires finally seem to be contained.

==Reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 45% based on 163 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "This thriller about a menacing cop wreaking havoc on his neighbors is tense enough but threatens absurdity when it enters into excessive potboiler territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1196215_lakeview_terrace? | title=Lakeview Terrace (2008) | publisher=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has an average weighted score of 47 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/lakeviewterrace | title=Lakeview Terrace Reviews | publisher=Metacritic | accessdate=September 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=Lakeview Terrace – CinemaScore |work=[[CinemaScore]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film a very positive review, awarding it his highest rating of four stars and saying: "Some will find it exciting. Some will find it an opportunity for an examination of conscience. Some will leave feeling vaguely uneasy. Some won't like it and will be absolutely sure why they don't, but their reasons will not agree. Some will hate elements that others can't even see. Some will only see a thriller. I find movies like this alive and provoking, and I'm exhilarated to have my thinking challenged at every step of the way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080918/REVIEWS/809180303 Lakeview Terrace review], Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times, September 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' also enjoyed the film, saying: "In its overall shape and message, ''Lakeview Terrace'' is a conventional suspense thriller, but the details kick it up a notch. ... The fun of ''Lakeview Terrace'' is not in what happens but in how it happens."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/18/DDMK1290A2.DTL&amp;type=movies Lakeview Terrace review], Mick LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle,&lt;/ref&gt; J.R. Jones of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' called the film "one of the toughest racial dramas to come out of Hollywood since the fires died down &amp;ndash; much tougher, for instance, than [[Paul Haggis]]'s hand-wringing Oscar winner ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/moviereviews/080918/ Lakeview Terrace review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921022013/http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/moviereviews/080918/ |date=21 September 2008 }}, J.R. Jones, Chicago Reader&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said that ''Lakeview Terrace'' "delivers fairly tense and engrossing drama" but "succumb[s] to thriller convention."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117938230.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;query=Lakeview+Terrace Lakeview Terrace review], Dennis Harvey, Variety&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Lane]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said that "the first hour of the film ... feels dangerous, necessary, and rife with comic disturbance," but added that "the later stages ... overheat and spill into silliness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2008/09/22/080922crci_cinema_lane?currentPage=1 Lakeview Terrace review], Anthony Lane, The New Yorker&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] of ReelViews gave the film two stars out of four, saying that "the first two-thirds of ''Lakeview Terrace'' offer a little more subtlety and complexity than the seemingly straightforward premise would afford, but the climax is loud, dumb, generic, and over-the-top."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/lakeview-terrace Lakeview Terrace review], James Berardinelli, ReelViews&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' said that "the movie might have something to say about black racism, but the conversations go nowhere, and the clichés of the genre take over."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&amp;id=11269 Lakeview Terrace review], Wesley Morris, Boston Globe&lt;/ref&gt; Sura Wood of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said: "[The idea of] a black actor cast as the virulent bigot, with the object of his campaign of harassment the young interracial couple who move in next door, could be viewed as a novel twist. But the film, absent a sense of place and populated by repellent or weak characters, soon devolves into an increasingly foul litany of events."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?rid=11631 Lakeview Terrace review], Sura Wood, The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' gave it one half of a star out of five, and called the film a "joyless and airless suspense thriller."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122177747252654291 Lakeview Terrace review], Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

On its opening weekend, the film grossed $15 million placing it at number one in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&amp;yr=2008&amp;wknd=38&amp;p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results from 9/19 to 9/21 | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | date=2008-09-21 | accessdate=26 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film grossed $39.2 million in the United States and Canada and $3.2 million in other territories, making $42.4 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lakeviewterrace.htm | title=Lakeview Terrace (2008) | publisher=Box Office Mojo | accessdate=26 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real life inspiration==
The plot was loosely based on [[real life]] events in [[Altadena, California]] involving an interracial couple, John and Mellaine Hamilton, and Irsie Henry, an African-American Los Angeles police officer. The saga was documented in a series of articles in both the ''[[Pasadena Star News]]'' and the ''[[Pasadena Weekly]]'' beginning in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=12 August 2012|journal=Pasadena Weekly|author=Coleman, Andre| url=http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/cms/story/detail/art_imitating_headlines/6125/ |date=8 August 2008|title=Art imitating headlines: New movie mirrors former cop’s ongoing racial feud with neighbors}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Journalist Andre Coleman received a Los Angeles' Press Club Award for Excellence in Journalism for his series of articles in the ''Weekly''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=12 August 2012|journal=Pasadena Weekly |title=Weekly wins Press Club awards|authors=Piasecki, Joe, Uhrich, Kevin &amp; Stolz, Kit |date=26 June 2008 |url=http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/cms/story/detail/weekly_wins_press_club_awards/6105/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry was eventually fired by LAPD for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=12 August 2012 |url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=in%20caco%2020100514023.xml&amp;docbase=cslwar3-2007-curr |work=leagle.com |title=HENRY v.

The fact that the Christ Candle in the centre of the [[Advent wreath]] is lit also indicates that [[Christmas]] has arrived.]]
'''Liturgical colours''' are those specific colours used for [[vestment]]s and [[Antependium|hangings]] within the context of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[liturgy]]. The symbolism of [[violet (color)|violet]], white, green, red, gold, black, [[Rose (color)|rose]] and other colours may serve to underline moods appropriate to a season of the [[liturgical year]] or may highlight a special occasion.

There is a distinction between the colour of the vestments worn by the clergy and their [[choir dress]], which with a few exceptions does not change with the liturgical seasons.

==Roman Catholic Church==

===Current rubrics===
In the [[Roman Rite]], as reformed by [[Pope Paul VI]], the following colours are used.&lt;ref name=IGMR&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/cdwlgrm.htm ''Institutio Generalis Missalis Romani''], no. 346; cf.

On more solemn days, i.e. festive, more precious, sacred vestments may be used, even if not of the colour of the day. Such vestments may, for instance, be made from [[cloth of gold]] or [[cloth of silver]]. Moreover, the Conference of Bishops may determine and propose to the Apostolic See adaptations suited to the needs and culture of peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[GIRM]], 346.g&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual Masses are celebrated in their proper colour, in white, or in a festive colour. Masses for Various Needs, on the other hand, are celebrated in the colour proper to the day or the season or in violet if they bear a penitential character. Votive Masses are celebrated in the colour suited to the Mass itself or even in the colour proper to the day or the season.&lt;ref&gt;[[GIRM]], 347&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regional and situational exceptions ====
Some particular variations:
*{{Color sample|#6495ed}} '''[[Marian blue|Blue]]''', a colour associated with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], is permitted for the feast of the [[Immaculate Conception]] in [[Spain]] and in some dioceses in [[Portugal]], [[Mexico]], and [[South America]]. In the [[Philippines]], it is authorised for all feasts of the Virgin Mary, a practice followed in some other places without official warrant. There have also been uses of blue in place of violet for the season of Advent despite the fact that this practice is not authorized under liturgical law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canticanova.com/articles/xmas/art1c1.htm Cantica Nova Publications], ''Advent Blues'', editorial by Gary D. Penkala, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Color sample|white}} '''White''' or {{Color sample|#d4af37}} '''[[cloth of gold]]''' was traditionally used for [[Misa de Gallo|the Novena]] from 16 to 24 December according to a Spanish custom abolished in that country in the 1950s, but still widely observed in the [[Philippines]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}. White is also used for East Asian Masses for the dead, as white is the traditional colour of mourning in many of the region's cultures. Furthermore, if not enough vestments of the proper colour are available (particularly in [[concelebration]]s), white may be used for all concelebrants.
*{{Color sample|#7f00ff}} '''Violet''' or {{Color sample|black}} '''black''' are often permitted on national holidays honoring military dead. For example in Canada, they are used on [[Remembrance Day]].
*{{Color sample|gold}} '''Gold''' or {{Color sample|silver}} '''silver''' may be worn on more solemn occasions in the dioceses of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[GIRM]], 346.h in publications for use in the U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-1969 rubrics===
The [[Roman Missal]], as revised by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1962, was authorised for use as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] by the 2007 ''[[motu proprio]]'' entitled ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''. Pope John XXIII's revision of the Missal incorporated changes that he had made with his ''motu proprio'' ''Rubricarum instructum'' of 29 July 1960;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962-pdf.html ''Missale Romanum'' 1962 in PDF Format]&lt;/ref&gt; these changes went into effect on January 1, 1961. The following are the differences between its rules for liturgical colours and the later rules:

[[Pope Pius X]] raised the rank of Sundays of ordinary time, so that on those that fell within octaves '''green''' was used instead of the colour of the octave, as had previously been the rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Rubricae generales Missalis: XVIII – De Coloribus Paramentorum'' in the [http://www.sanctamissa.org/EN/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html 1920 typical edition] of the Roman Missal omitted the phrase "exceptis Dominicis infra octavas occurrentibus, in quibus color octavarum servatur" found in earlier editions beginning with Pope Pius V's edition of 1570 (page 21 of the facsimile published by Libreria Editrice Vaticana in 1998 – {{ISBN|88-209-2547-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules on liturgical colours before the time of Pope Pius X were essentially those indicated in the edition of the Roman Missal that [[Pope Pius V]] promulgated in 1570, except for the addition of feasts not included in his Missal. The scheme of colours in his Missal reflected usage that had become fixed in Rome by the twelfth century.

==Byzantine Rite==
The [[Byzantine Rite]], which is used by all the member churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Byzantine Rite Lutheranism|Byzantine Lutheran Churches]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] of Byzantine Rite, does not have a universal system of colours, with the service-books of the Byzantine tradition only specifying "light" or "dark" vestments in the service books. In the Greek tradition, [[Maroon (colour)|maroon]] or [[Burgundy (color)|burgundy]] are common for solemn feast days, and a wide variety of colours are used at other times, the most common of which are gold and white.

Slavic-use churches and others influenced by Western traditions have adopted a cycle of liturgical colours.  The particulars may change from place to place, but generally:

|}

The colours would be changed before [[Vespers]] on the eve of the day being commemorated.  During Great Feasts, the colour is changed before the vespers service that begins the first day of a [[forefeast]], and remains until the apodosis (final day of the [[afterfeast]]).

Under Western influence, black is often used in the Slavic churches for funerals, weekdays of Great Lent, and Holy Week as a sign of [[penance]] and mourning, but in the second half of the 20th century, the ancient white became more common, as a sign of the hope of the Resurrection.

==Russian liturgical colours==

According to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]'s ''Nastol'naya Kniga Sviashchenno-sluzhitelia'',&lt;ref&gt;Nastol'naya Kniga Sviashchenno-sluzhitelia, Volume 4, Moscow,1983, Translated in "The Messenger" of St. Andrew's Russian Orthodox Cathedral,Philadelphia, June, July–August, September, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; up to eight different liturgical colours may be used throughout the year.  Exact usage of these colours varies, but the following are the most common uses.

==Coptic Rite==
The [[Copts|Coptic]] tradition, followed by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] and the [[Coptic Catholic Church]], only uses white vestments, with gold and silver being considered variations of white. The only exception is during [[Passion Week]] when black is used. Nonetheless, trimmings of red, gold or blue may be found on some vestments.

==Ethiopian Rite==
The liturgical tradition of Ethiopia, followed by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] and the [[Ethiopian Catholic Church]], embraces a wide variety of liturgical colours. In [[Eritrea]], similar traditions are followed.

==Lutheran churches==
The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA), uses the same colour scheme as that of the Anglicans and their Scandinavian Lutheran counterparts, but with the use of gold only for the Easter Vigil and Easter Sunday services, with Holy Week using scarlet in place of crimson.

Both the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS) use a similar system, but with purple being the primary colour for both Advent and Lent (with blue being the alternate colour for Advent only), and the use of gold in place of white for both Christmas and Easter (in similar practice to the Catholic Church).  In the WELS, the use of red is also done during the ''Period of End Times'', a period of the Church regarding the teachings of the Book of Revelation, culminating in the creation of the New Jerusalem (corresponding to Christ the King in the ELCA). In all three churches, including the ELCA, red is also worn on the last Sunday of October, in celebration of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] on October 31, when [[Martin Luther]] nailed the [[95 Theses]] onto the door of Wittenberg Castle Church.

==Anglicanism==
[[Image:Lenten Array Edgbaston.jpg|thumb|right|Lenten Array altar frontal by [[George Pace]] at [[St Augustine's Church, Edgbaston|St Augustine's, Edgbaston]]]]
Most [[Anglican]] churches use the colours appointed in the Roman Rite, usually in its post-1969 form, with the exception of Sarum Blue replacing violet for Advent, but some use the earlier form, with, for instance, black in place of red on [[Good Friday]]. Some churches use black at Masses for the dead, but more commonly white or purple is used. For historical reasons much of the worldwide Anglican Communion takes a noticeable lead from the practice of the [[Church of England]]. Since the 1980 [[Alternative Service Book]], liturgical colours have been recommended for seasons, with more detailed advice offered as part of the [[Common Worship]] series of liturgies, including colours for all Sundays and festivals printed in the 'core volume' next to collects.

The Church's published Lectionary now makes detailed suggestions for liturgical colour throughout the year, which corresponds almost exactly with the above table of Roman Rite (post-1969 usage) usage with five minor exceptions, and one more significant one:

:* there is no reference in Anglican usage to Masses of deceased popes and cardinals;
:* no liturgical colour at all is suggested for [[Holy Saturday]] (the words "hangings removed" are printed);
:* the recommendation of red for confirmation rites is extended also to ordination rites;
:* Lenten Array (unbleached linen) continues to be listed as an alternative option to purple during Lent;
:* the option exists for using red instead of green during the "Kingdom Season", the four last Sundays of the liturgical year, culminating in [[Christ the King]], as is common is some Lutheran traditions (see below);
:* finally, and more significantly, the Church of England provision suggests white throughout the Sundays after [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] as a distinct "Epiphany season", with ordinary time commencing the day after [[Candlemas]].

The colour scheme suggested by the [[Church of England]] also indicates where gold vestments should be used in those churches that possess gold and white as distinct colours. The use of rose-pink vestments, as in the Roman Rite table above, was mentioned as an option in early editions of Common Worship,&lt;ref&gt;The use of rose-pink vestments is suggested in the liturgical colour sequence notes of [[Common Worship]] of which an [http://www.cofe.anglican.org/worship/liturgy/commonworship/texts/rules/rulesyear.html on-line version may be found here].&lt;/ref&gt; and is a listed option in the annual published lectionary; however, later Common Worship publications have begun to refer to this practice as "traditional" reflecting its resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see "Common Worship - Times &amp; Seasons", added to the Common Worship series in 2006, page 50, paragraph 1: "rose-pink vestments are traditionally worn".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarum Rite===
The [[Sarum Rite]] was a medieval liturgical rite used in [[England]] before the [[Reformation]] which had a distinct set of liturgical colours. After the [[Anglo-Catholic]] Revival of the 19th century, certain [[Church of England]] churches began adopting Sarum liturgical colours as an attempt to produce something that was an English expression of [[Catholicism]] rather than a Roman expression. One of the chief advocates behind this was [[Percy Dearmer]]. The exact colours used by the mediaeval Sarum rite are a matter of dispute, but colours adopted by contemporary churches claiming to use the Sarum scheme include in particular deep blue for [[Advent]], which may be popularly referred to as "Sarum blue", and unbleached linen for [[Lent]]. The Sarum rite has never received official approval in the [[Church of England]] or in [[The Episcopal Church]], but has influenced a number of cathedrals and parish churches.

==Methodist churches==
[[Methodism|Methodists]] use a colour scheme similar to those used by Lutherans and Catholics, although the practice is not universally followed. [[The United Methodist Church]], prior to the early-1990s, used red solely for Pentecost, even including the Sundays after Pentecost Sunday, with the use of green being reserved for the season of [[Kingdomtide]], which usually lasted from late August/early September until Christ the King (the last Sunday in Kingdomtide). Since the publication of the [[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)|1992 Book of Worship]], the UMC has followed the ELCA practice of wearing red only for Pentecost and [[Reformation Sunday]] and green for the rest of the Pentecost season.

==Reformed churches==
The [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] has sanctioned the use of liturgical colours and promoted their use in the 1993 Book of Common Worship (although their use was also promoted in the church's annual Planning Calendars beginning in the 1980s). Advent and Lent are periods of preparation and repentance and are represented by the colour purple. The feasts of Christmas Day and Christmastide, Epiphany Sunday, Baptism of the Lord Sunday, Transfiguration Sunday, Easter Season, Trinity Sunday, and Christ the King Sunday are represented by white. Green is the colour for periods of Ordinary Time. Red is for Pentecost Sunday, but may also be used for ordinations, church anniversaries, and memorial services for ordained clergy. Red or purple are appropriate for Palm Sunday. During Holy Week, the church may use purple or remain bare (although a few churches will use black for Good Friday).

Similarly, the [[United Church of Christ]] includes indications of which liturgical colour to use for each Sunday in its annual calendar. The general Western pattern is followed, with either purple or blue recommended for Advent.&lt;ref&gt;''United Church of Christ Desk Calendar and Plan Book 2016,'' http://www.uccresources.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3108">'''Manasology''' (кyrgyz. ''Манастаануу'') is a separate line of research within Kyrgyz studies, which looks into the scientific study of the Kyrgyz [[Manas epic]]. Representatives of this [[scientific]] area are called ''manasologists''.

==Periods of development==
Scientific research of the epic began in the second half of the XIX century by Ch. [[Valikhanov]] and V. [[Radlov]]. Valikhanov had recorded one of the episodes ("Pominki po Kyokyotoyu") in 1856 and partially translated it into Russian. The texts published by Radlov in 1885 in St. Petersburg (in Kyrgyz and German languages) occupy 12,454 lines (including 9449 lines about "Manas")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karalaev|first1=Sayakbai|title=Manas|date=1984|location=Frunze|url=https://bilim.akipress.org/lib/book:333/manas-po-variantu-sayakbaya-karalaeva-kniga-1-frunze-1984g/?from=bilim&amp;place=type|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Full record of the texts of the "Manas" [[trilogy]] has been carried out since 1920, however, fixing versions by [[manaschi]], let alone their full publication are still far from complete.

Kazakh writer M.O. Auezov wrote the first work after Chokan Valikhanov’s works, a monograph on the Kyrgyz "[[Epic of Manas|Manas]]" epic, by creating of a free version of his texts. Monuments were erected for both Kazakh researchers in the [[Bishkek]] city. Among the [[Russian scientists]] who studied the epic, V. Radlov should be noted (the author of the first Russian translation of fragments of the epic), P. Falev (the author of the first [[Soviet]] study on "Manas" - articles "How the Kara-Kygyz epic is built") and S. [[Malov]].

The All-Union Scientific Conference of 1952 in [[Bishkek|Frunze]] came to the conclusion that the epic "is folk in its basis"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karalayev|first1=Sayakbai|title=Manas II|date=1984|location=Frunze|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Among the translators of the epic into Russian are S. [[Lipkin]], L. [[Penkovsky]], M. Tarlovskiy and others. The largest Russian translation (prosaic) is in 4 volumes  so far by A.S. Mirbadaleva and N. V. Kydaish-Pokrovskaya for a bilingual edition in the series "Epic of the Peoples of the USSR" (1984-1995), covers about 50 thousand lines (according to S.Orozbakov).

The first one who played the "Manas" epic in [[Russian language]] in the translations of E. [[Polivanov]], L. [[Penkovsky]], M. Tarlevsky and S. [[Lipkin]], is a national artist of Kyrgyzstan Valery Rovinsky.

Abbreviated versions of the epic exist in [[Kazakh language]] (4 volumes in M. Auezov's presentation, including 2 parts about Manas and the part about Semetey and Seytek) and in [[Uzbek language]] (the poet Mirtemir); separate episodes were translated into German, Hungarian, English and other languages.

==Scientific institutions==
The main center of manasology is the National Center for Manasology and Art Culture of the National Academy of Sciences of the [[Kyrgyz Republic]] (director - Akmataliev, Abdyldazhan Amanturovich).

The '''Melisende Psalter''' (London, British Library, Egerton MS 1139) is an [[illuminated manuscript]] commissioned around 1135 in the [[crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], probably by [[King Fulk]] for his wife [[Queen Melisende]]. It is a notable example of [[Crusade]]r art, which resulted from a merging of the artistic styles of [[Roman Catholic]] Europe, the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Byzantine Empire]] and the art of the [[Armenian illuminated manuscript]].

Seven scribes and illuminators, working in the [[scriptorium]] built by the crusaders in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]], were involved in the creation of the [[psalter]]. It measures 21.6 centimetres by 14 centimetres.

This manuscript forms part of the [[Egerton Collection]] in the [[British Library]].

==The New Testament cycle==
[[Image:Melisende-Psalter f5v.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Christ's entry into Jerusalem from the Melisende Psalter]]

The first twenty-four illustrations (on each side of the first twelve [[Bookbinding|folio]]s) depict scenes from the [[New Testament]]. New Testament images were commonly found at the beginning of western psalters, unlike in eastern psalters, but in this case the images depict scenes more common in the Eastern Orthodox [[liturgy]]. The scenes depicted are the [[Annunciation]], [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]], the [[Biblical Magi|Adoration of the Magi]], the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]], the [[Baptism of Jesus]], the [[Temptation of Christ]], the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], the [[Raising of Lazarus]], the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem]] (see illustration), the [[Last Supper]], the [[Washing of the Feet]], the [[Agony in the Garden]], the [[Betrayal of Christ|Betrayal of Judas]], the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], the [[Descent from the Cross]], the [[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]], the [[Harrowing of Hell]], [[the Three Marys]] at the Tomb, and the [[Deesis]]. 

These illustrations were made by an illuminator named Basilius, who signed the last illustration (pictured above) ''Basilius me fecit'', and is the only named illuminator or scribe of this manuscript. Nothing is known about Basilius, but because of his Greek name it has been suggested that he was a Byzantine artist; it is also possible that he was a western artist who had been trained in a Greek style, maybe in [[Constantinople]]; or he may have been an [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]], familiar with both Catholic and Orthodox traditions.

==The calendar==
[[Image:Melisende-Psalter f9v.jpg|thumb|right|Folio 9v - The Harrowing of Hell]]
Folios 13-21 contain the calendar, which is strikingly similar to psalter calendars produced in [[England]] in the same period. It appears to be based on a calendar of [[Winchester Cathedral|St. Swithun's church]] in [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]]. The calendar is filled with English [[feast day|saint days]] rather than those more popular in Jerusalem, and one name, St. [[Martin of Tours]], a saint popular throughout Europe, is written in gold, for unknown reasons. Three crusader-specific dates are mentioned in the calendar: the capture of Jerusalem on July 15, the death of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] on August 21, and the death of his wife [[Morphia of Melitene|Morphia]] on October 1. Each month also has a medallion with a sign of the [[Zodiac]], illustrated in a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style with heavy Islamic influences.

==The psalter==
Folios 22-196 contain the Latin [[psalm]]s written in a northern French script. A third illuminator painted the initial letters of each psalm. Some initials take up the entire side of a leaf, and are drawn with gold lettering on a purple background. They show influence from [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Islamic art]], possibly suggesting that the artist was trained in Muslim-influenced southern Italy.

==Prayers to the saints==
The scribe who wrote the psalms also wrote a series of prayers on folios 197-211, dedicated to nine saints - the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], [[Michael (archangel)|St. Michael]], [[John the Baptist|St. John the Baptist]], [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]], [[John the Evangelist|St. John the Evangelist]], [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen]], [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]], [[Mary Magdalene|St. Mary Magdalene]], and [[Saint Agnes|St. Agnes]]. The prayers are accompanied by paintings of the saints by a fourth illuminator trained in a Romanesque style, but his technique also shows an attempt to incorporate a Byzantine style. There are a few blank and undecorated spaces in this section of the psalter, and it may be incomplete.

==The covers==
The [[ivory]] covers, decorated with some small [[turquoise]] beads, show scenes from the life of [[King David]] and from the ''[[Psychomachia]]'' of [[Aurelius Clemens Prudentius|Prudentius]] on the front side, and another king performing the Six Works of Mercy from the [[Gospel of Matthew]] on the back side, both showing influence from Byzantine, Islamic, and western art. The geometric designs on the covers are especially influenced by Islamic art. The king on the back side is dressed in Byzantine imperial clothes, but most likely represents a crusader king, perhaps Fulk. There is a carving of a [[falcon]] above him, which is possibly a clue that the king is Fulk, as "falcon" and "Fulk" in [[Old French]] were both "Fouque." Underneath the falcon the name "Herodius" is carved, Latin for Gyrfalcon; although the artist has not signed in the same way Basilius has. 

The spine of the psalter is decorated with Byzantine [[silk]] and [[silver]] thread, as well as red, blue, and green [[Greek cross]]es (which are also found in the royal arms of the kingdom). The spine was stitched by an artisan who was perhaps a westerner trained in a Byzantine style, as his stitching is not as smooth as other examples of Byzantine silk spines made by native Greeks.

==Date and recipient==
The exact date of the psalter, and for whom it was made, is unknown, although it is obviously made for a noble woman of the kingdom, based on the use of Byzantine styles (considered to be "aristocratic" by the crusaders), the depictions of kings, and the use of feminine word endings in the [[Latin]] prayers. Through circumstantial evidence [[Queen Melisende]] can probably be identified as the recipient. The English influence in the calendar and elsewhere likely comes from [[King Fulk]], who was related to the English royal family by marriage. It is also notable that aside from the capture of Jerusalem, the only crusader-specific dates in the calendar are the deaths of Melisende's parents, [[King Baldwin II]] and [[Queen Morphia]]. The mixture of Catholic and Orthodox elements in the psalter may reflect Melisende's mixed upbringing (Baldwin was Catholic and Morphia was an [[Armenia]]n of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] faith).  

If Melisende was indeed the recipient, then the psalter was most likely commissioned by Fulk, probably around 1135. Prior to this, Fulk and Melisende had been fighting for superiority in the kingdom, and Melisende had allied with rebels against Fulk; by 1134 they had reconciled, and the psalter had to have been written after 1131, the date of Baldwin II's death. On the other hand, it could have been written anytime before Melisende's death in 1161. [[Palaeographical]] comparisons to other texts produced in Jerusalem suggest it was written in the 1140s (or even the 1150s), but the later texts may have used the Melisende Psalter as a source. 

The manuscript was perhaps owned by [[Grande Chartreuse]], Grenoble, in the early 19th century. By about 1840 it was owned by [[Ambroise Commarmond]], director of the [[Musée des beaux-arts de Lyon]], Lyon. Its next owner was [[Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja|Guglielmo Libri]] (b. 1802, d. 1869), who is most famous for stealing medieval mansucripts from French public libraries; he sold it to the London book dealers [[Payne and Foss]], who in turn sold to the [[British Museum]] in November 1845.

The '''''Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine''''' (or '''''Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara''''') is a c. 1480 oil-on-oak painting by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Hans Memling]], now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.  The panel shows an enthroned [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin]] holding the [[Child Jesus|Child]]. [[Catherine of Alexandria|St Catherine of Alexandria]] and [[St Barbara]] are seated alongside. Angels playing instruments flank the throne, while the left hand male figure is presumably the donor. The scene is set before a landscape. 

Intended as a devotional donor portrait, the panel combines elements of a ''[[hortus conclusus]]'', ''[[Sacred conversation|sacra conversazione]]'' and ''[[Virgo inter Virgines]]'' – the latter of which always presents Mary with Saints Catherine and Barbara. The work is characteristic of Memling's serene style, with structure and colors in harmony.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth116" /&gt; The painting reflects techniques Memling probably learned from his predecessors [[Rogier van der Weyden]], to whom he was almost certainly apprenticed, and [[Jan van Eyck]], synthesizing elements of the earlier artists' work.

The composition is an almost exact copy of Memling's central panel in the ''[[St John Altarpiece (Memling)|St John Altarpiece]]''.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth116"&gt;Ainsworth (1998), 116&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown when Memling painted the ''Mystic Marriage''; 1480 seems a probable date according to [[dendrochronology|tree ring]] analysis. The arbor arching over the Virgin's throne was added at a later date, probably in the 16th century.&lt;ref name = "Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/437054 "Virgin and Child with Saints"].

==Description==
[[File:Memling St Catherine detail.jpg|thumb|left|340px|Detail of St Catherine receiving the ring, musical angel, and donor]]

The painting depicts the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin]] and [[Child Jesus|Child]] flanked by saints and angels; the donor kneels to the left of the holy figures. The Virgin sits on a throne beneath a [[baldachin]] (canopy of honor) of rich brocade with the child on her lap. In the garden behind her emblem, an iris, is visible. Two angels dressed in liturgical garments with musical instruments stand to either side of the throne; the one to the left plays a portable organ and the one on right plays a harp.  The martyr virgin saint, [[Catherine of Alexandria|St Catherine of Alexandria]] kneels in front of Mary to the left; opposite is [[St Barbara]], who sits to the right, reading a [[missal]].&lt;ref name="Ainsworth116" /&gt; The donor kneels behind St Catherine, a set of rosary beads in his hands. Attached to his hip, barely visible, is either a small purse or a coat-of-arms.&lt;ref name = "Ridderbos136"&gt;Ridderbos (2005), 136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Master of Flkmalle Madonna and Child with Saints in the Enclosed Garden.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Robert Campin]], ''Virgin and Child with Saints in an Enclosed Garden'', c. late 14th century – early 15th century]]

St Catherine was highly venerated in the Middle Ages, second only in popularity to the [[Mary Magdalene|Magdelen]].&lt;ref name = "Snyder35"&gt;Snyder (1987), 35&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Maxentius]] tortured Catherine on an iron-spiked wheel and later, when she proclaimed herself married to Christ, cut off her head.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth116" /&gt;  According to her legend the [[Mystical marriage of Saint Catherine|mystic marriage]] occurred in a dream from which she awoke with a ring on her finger. Her emblems are the [[breaking wheel]] and sword, seen in the foreground, peeking out from beneath the voluminous folds of her ermine-lined skirt.&lt;ref name = "Snyder35"/&gt;

To denote her royal birth, Catherine wears a crown on her head and is dressed in rich clothing – a white [[tabard]], red velvet sleeves, and a richly patterned brocade skirt.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth116" /&gt;   She extends her left hand to the Christ Child who places the ring on her finger, symbolizing their spiritual or mystical betrothal.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth116" /&gt;  James Snyder writes that typical of Memling's art, "the drama of the moment is in no way reflected by the expressions on the faces of the participants."&lt;ref name = "Snyder35"/&gt;

Another bride, St Barbara, sits across from Catherine,&lt;ref name = "Snyder35"/&gt; in front of the tower, the emblem of where her father had her imprisoned and where she was secretly baptized. It is shaped of a [[monstrance]] for the [[sacramental bread]]; its three windows symbolize the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name = "Ridderbos136"&gt;Ridderbos (2005), 136&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1910 [[William Henry James Weale|James Weale]] identified Catherine as probably an early portrait of [[Mary of Burgundy]] and Barbara as the earliest likeness of [[Margaret of York]],&lt;ref name ="Weale177"&gt;Weale (1910), 177&lt;/ref&gt; which medieval art historian Thomas Kren thinks is plausible. Both women belonged to the Guild of St Barbara at Ghent; Margaret of York was an avid bibliophile who commissioned a number of illuminated manuscripts, one of which was a ''Life of St Catherine''.&lt;ref name ="Kren"&gt;Kren (1992), 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- and a recent exhumation gives physical examination of Mary of Burgundy's skull.&lt;ref name ="Kren"&gt;Kren (1992), 43&lt;/ref&gt; ??? clarify?? find this source--&gt;

The features of the female faces show Memling's development, according to Ainsworth, who writes that by this period he had "settled on a certain successful female type" of a graceful oval face, wide eyes and narrow chins, and expressions reflecting "a state of gentle, beatific acceptance."&lt;ref name="Ainsworth116" /&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Master of the Virgo inter Virgines - Virgin and Child with Sts Catherine, Cecilia, Barbara, and Ursula - WGA14638.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Master of the Virgo inter Virgines]], ''Virgin and Child with female martyr saints'', c. late 1480s]]

A common Marian presentation in Late Gothic art was the ''[[hortus conclusus]]'', depicting the Virgin and Child in an enclosed garden. Memling extends the theme by positioning the group against an open sweeping background landscape.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth116" /&gt;  The painting also contains elements of a ''[[Sacred conversation|sacra conversazione]]'' and the more specific ''Virgo inter Virgines''.&lt;ref name="Blum 1969, 93"&gt;Blum (1969), 93&lt;/ref&gt;  In a ''sacra conversazione'', Virgin and Child are grouped with saints and donors, whereas a ''Virgo inter Virgines'' presents the Virgin and Child only with virgin martyr saints and more often without the donor.  The latter gained popularity in the Low Countries during the late 15th century; the setting was almost always in an enclosed garden, the grouping always included Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine and Barbara. Frequently St Catherine's mystical marriage is depicted. Depending on the wishes of the donor or the purpose of a work, other virgin saints such as [[Dorothea of Caesarea|Dorothy]] or [[Saint Cecilia|Cecilia]] were added to the grouping. Paula Pumplin writes the subgenre might have originated with [[Hugo van der Goes]] or with Memling.&lt;ref&gt;Pumplin (2010), 317–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Such 15th-century paintings were always devotional in nature, commissioned by donors whose earthly concern was spiritual salvation after death.&lt;ref name = "Bauman17"&gt;Bauman (1986), 17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele]]'' (1434–36) is considered the most evocative and realistic of the period according to Guy Bauman. He writes van Eyck perfectly captures the essence between mortal and divine, and ''Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele'' functions as an epitaph or perhaps a commemorative piece.&lt;ref name = "Bauman25"&gt;Bauman (1986), 25&lt;/ref&gt; The function of Memling's ''Mystic Marriage'' is unknown; other than the prayer beads held in the donor's hand, which signify his devotion to the cult of the virgin, nothing is known about him.  Bauman speculates the work could have been an epigraph, or a commemorative piece, because Memling's positioning of the donor behind the saints bears a slight similarity to van Eyck's ''Canon van der Paele''.&lt;ref name = "Bauman30"&gt;Bauman (1986), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memling St Catherine grape arbor.jpg|left|thumb|Grape arbor detail]]

The grape arbor arching over the canopy is a later addition, perhaps requested by the donor or a subsequent owner. Technical examination reveals significant differences between Memling's style and the hand that executed the arbor: the green pigments differ from the pigments used for the green background landscape; and the brushstrokes "are broader and more descriptive of nature than are the schematic strokes that characterize the stylized trees and bushes of the background landscape". The grape arbor is absent from the extensive underdrawings.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth2005,55" &gt;Ainsworth (2005), 55&lt;/ref&gt; An early 16th century copy of the painting at the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]] in Florence contains a similar motif, suggesting the arbor was added either during Memling's lifetime or so soon after he died. The arbor's paint is similar in age to the painting's original paint layer, adding credence to the theory it was probably added soon after its execution, probably at the request of the donor. It was not unusual for owners to request alterations to a paintings, often to keep them up-to-date. The iconography of the grape arbor was at that time a common means to signify [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|the blood of Christ]], particularly significant in Memling's city of [[Bruges]] where the [[Basilica of the Holy Blood]] was thought to house a relic of Christ's blood.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth2005,56" &gt;Ainsworth (2005), 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and composition==
[[File:Hans Memling 065.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Center panel, ''[[St John Altarpiece (Memling)|St John Altarpiece]]'']]

Memling was almost certainly apprenticed to [[Rogier van der Weyden]] whose style influenced the younger painter.&lt;ref name = "Friedländerr42"&gt;Friedlænder (1956), 42&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1460s Memling's style was developed; according to [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Max Friedländer]] he is best characterized as "an assured pictorial interpreter of quiet mood,  at his best when presenting the Virgin in a circle of female saints or as a portraitist."&lt;ref name = "Friedländerr44"&gt;Friedlænder (1956), 44&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for a style that captures a sense of serenity and grace,&lt;ref name = "Friedländerr44"/&gt; which garnered a great amount of admiration during the late-19th century, when he was thought to be was thought to be a painter who saw with his soul. In the early-20th century, however, he was criticized as lacking innovation. Bernhard Ridderbros writes that neither analysis credits Memling "with the significance of his work, which was considerable", nor credits the extent to which he synthesized the techniques and motifs of his predecessors, van der Weyden and van Eyck.&lt;ref name = "Ridderbos140"&gt;Ridderbos (2005), 140&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Memling - Madonna Enthroned with Child and Two Angels - WGA14987.jpg|thumb|Memling's ''Madonna Enthroned with Child and Two Angels'', c. 1490]]

The composition of the ''Mystic Marriage of St Catherine'' is almost identical to the central panel of Memling's ''[[St John Altarpiece (Memling)|St John Altarpiece]]'', except that the former is set in a columned space.  According to Ainsworth, aside from differences in the folds of the saints' dresses the figures are "virtually identical in type, costume and gesture".  The altarpiece has the two St Johns flanking the heavenly figures, whereas here the single donor is shown to the left of St Catherine.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth116" /&gt;  Guy Bauman suggests the donor's presence on the left is intrusive, writing that Memling's proclivity for symmetry "has resulted in a curious compositional solution that balances the donor with Saint Barbara's tower".&lt;ref name = "Bauman25" /&gt;

Ainsworth explains the panel "reveals spontaneous and rather detailed underdrawing", which is typical for Memling. She speculates he used preliminary workshop studies as a basis for this panel and other similar renditions of the same scene.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth116" /&gt;  The nature of the black chalk underdrawings, visible via technical analyses, suggests he drew them freely before applying layers of paint to achieve a smooth surface. Almost certainly the two paintings, despite their similarities, were not the product of a template or other mechanical means of copying.&lt;ref name = "Met"/&gt;

Memling was unique in repeating his work; according to Shirley Blum he "duplicated scenes and motifs to an extent never before witnessed in Netherlandish painting."&lt;ref name="Blum 1969, 97"/&gt; She writes he failed to achieve a sense of unity across the panels of the ''St John Altarpiece'',&lt;ref name="Blum 1969, 94"&gt;Blum (1969), 94&lt;/ref&gt; which he solved by simplifying imagery and by depicting a single idea on a single panel. Unlike van Eyck, whose overwhelmingly large Madonnas symbolize the church in which they stand, hidden or disguised symbolism is absent in Memling's work. His straightforward and literal details function as nothing other than as ornamentation and background for the Virgin. In his later work, the ornamentation became increasingly elaborate and Italianesque.&lt;ref name="Blum 1969, 97"&gt;Blum (1969), 97&lt;/ref&gt; Friedländer likened him to [[Fra Angelico]] in that Memling not so much copied or repeated his work, but rather "he pictured ''the'' Madonna as she took form in his imagination, depicting therefore always the same body and the same soul."&lt;ref name ="Friedländer116"&gt;Friedländer (1920), 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution and provenance==
Only two of Memling's works are definitively attributed and dated; both are at [[Old St. John's Hospital]] ''(Sint-Janshospitaal''). The ''St John Altarpiece'' is inscribed with a date of 1479, almost certainly the date it was installed; ''[[Triptych of Jan Floreins]]'' is inscribed and probably commissioned by a prelate or brother at the hospital. Attributions and dating depend on stylistic analysis, but because Memling repeated compositions such as this, dating is more problematic. Generally art historians agree he executed ''St. Catherine'' at about the same time as the altarpiece, probably around 1480.&lt;ref name = "Hand184"&gt;Hand (1987), 184&lt;/ref&gt;  Friedländer first suggested the 1480 date in 1916;&lt;ref name ="Friedländer188"/&gt; a date that since has been substantiated with [[dendrochronology|tree ring]] analysis.&lt;ref name = "Met"/&gt;

There is no record of the painting's owners until its purchased by [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]] of London, who may have acquired it on a trip to Bruges, or from Dr. John Taylor of Ashbourne, who is recorded as an owner. It was bequeathed to a Mrs Davenport in London,&lt;ref name = "Met"/&gt; who showed it [[Burlington House]]. At an unknown date it was acquired by architect [[George Frederick Bodley|G. F. Bodley]] and later sold to an London art dealer who had it cleaned and passed it to Parisian dealer, Leopold Goldschmidt. He had it exhibited in the 1902 [[Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges|Bruges exposition]].&lt;ref name ="Friedländer188"&gt;Friedländer (1916), 188, 193&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin Altman bought it in 1911 for $200,000 and bequeathed it on his death in 1913 to the Altman Collection at New York's Metropolitan museum.&lt;ref name = "Met"/&gt;

The '''New Amsterdam Theatre''' is a [[Broadway theatre]] located at 214 West [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] between [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh]] and [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth]] Avenues in the [[Theater District, New York|Theater District]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], off of [[Times Square]].  It was built in 1902–1903 and was designed by the architecture firm of [[Herts &amp; Tallant|Henry Hertz and Hugh Tallant]];&lt;ref name=encnyc&gt;Alexander, Cathy. "New Amsterdam Theatre" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, pp.888-89&lt;/ref&gt; the Roof Garden, where more risqué productions were presented, and which no longer exists, was added in 1904, designed by the same firm.&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aia&gt;{{cite AIA4}}, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;  The remainder of the building was utilized for offices.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;

From 1913 to 1927, the theatre was the home of the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'', whose producer, [[Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr.]], maintained an office in the building, and operated a nightclub on the roof.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; ''[[George White's Scandals]]'' and [[Eva LeGallienne]]'s [[Civic Repertory Theatre]] were subsequent tenants. It was used as a movie theatre beginning in 1937, closed in 1985, and was leased by [[The Walt Disney Company]] and renovated by [[Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer]] in 1995–97 to be the flagship for [[Disney Theatrical Productions]] presentations on Broadway.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

Both the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] exterior and the [[Art Nouveau]] interior of the building are [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmarks]], having been designated in 1979.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;&lt;ref name=aia /&gt;  In addition, the building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.

Along with the [[Hudson Theatre|Hudson]] and [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum]] Theatres, also built in 1903, the New Amsterdam is one of the oldest surviving Broadway venues.

[[File:New Amsterdam Theater - 42nd St. - New York Vity 1905 crop.jpg|thumb|left|The theatre in 1905]]

The [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] facade&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt; of the New Amsterdam is a narrow slice which leads to the theatre's interior, the first concrete example of architectural [[Art Nouveau]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;Waters, Theodore "The New Amsterdam Theatre: A triumph of the new art", ''[[Everybody's Magazine]]'' (July–December 1903) pp 488&lt;/ref&gt; The building was constructed in 1902–03&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;&lt;ref name=aia /&gt; by the partnership of impresarios [[A.L. Erlanger]] and [[Marcus Klaw]], and was designed by architects [[Herts &amp; Tallant]]. Decorating was carried out by an extensive team of painters and sculptors that included [[George Gray Barnard]], [[Robert Frederick Blum|Robert Blum]], the brothers Neumark, George Daniel M. Peixotto,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=158&amp;letter=P ''The Jewish Encyclopedia'': "Peixotto"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roland Hinton Perry]] and Albert G. Wenzel. At the time of construction, it was the largest theatre in New York, with a [[seating capacity]] of 1,702.

The theatre opened October 23, 1903 with a production of Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. For many years, it hosted the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'', showcasing such talents as [[Fanny Brice]], [[Bert Williams]], [[Will Rogers]], [[Eddie Cantor]], [[W.C. Fields]], [[Marilyn Miller]], [[Sophie Tucker]], [[The Seven Little Eatons|Eaton siblings]] and [[silent film]] star [[Olive Thomas]] whose ghost supposedly haunts the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2006/dvd/olive_thomas/ |title=The Olive Thomas Collection|author=Neibaur, James L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A racier sister show of the ''Follies'', the ''Midnight Frolics'', played in the New Amsterdam's Roof Garden theatre. The New Amsterdam was the scene of [[Marilyn Miller]]'s greatest triumphs in the musicals ''[[Sally (musical)|Sally]]'' (1920) and ''[[Sunny (musical)|Sunny]]'', which opened in September 1925 co-starring [[Clifton Webb]] as Harold Wendell-Wendell and ran for three seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, John (ed), ''Who's Who in the Theatre'', 10th revised edition, London, 1947: 1429&lt;/ref&gt; But the theatre also hosted serious productions, and in June 1927 [[Basil Rathbone]] appeared there as Cassius in ''Julius Caesar''.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, John (ed), ''Who's Who in the Theatre'', 10th revised edition, London, 1947: 1184&lt;/ref&gt;

The premiere of the [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Otto Harbach]] scored ''[[Roberta]]'' starring [[Bob Hope]], [[George Murphy]], [[Fay Templeton]] and [[Lyda Roberti]] opened at the New Amsterdam November 18, 1933.

==Restoration==
The [[Great Depression]] did much harm to the legitimate-theatre business, and in 1936 the New Amsterdam closed. It reopened on a limited basis in 1937 but was soon converted to a [[movie theatre]]. The New York City Industrial Development Corporation raised a {{US$|4 million}} bond issue to purchase the property in 1982 and retained title while responsibility for development and bond payment rested with the [[Nederlander Organization]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1984, the [[Empire State Development Corporation]] and [[New York City Economic Development Corporation]] purchased the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19019444/disney_opens_on_times_square_ap_eltman/|title=Disney opens on Times Square|last=Eltman|first=Frank|date=March 31, 1995|work=Indiana Gazette|access-date=April 7, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|agency=Associated Press|page=E-3|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having spent {{US$|15 million}} on the property, Nederlander announced in 1990 that it did not consider restoration of the property to be economically feasible; thereafter in 1992, a settlement was reached where the [[New York State Urban Development Corporation]] would take ownership and begin "structural stabilization" immediately through the 42&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Street Development Project.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dunlap, David.

During its years as a movie theatre, the Roof Garden was used as a rehearsal space for a number of shows, including the original Broadway productions of ''[[My Fair Lady (musical)|My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'' and ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]''.

[[Disney Theatrical Productions]] signed a 49-year revenue-based lease for the property in May 1995, with Disney Development restoring the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Shawn G.|last2=Lesser|first2=Ellen C.|title=Disney and Developer Are Chosen To Build 42d Street Hotel Complex|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/12/nyregion/disney-and-developer-are-chosen-to-build-42d-street-hotel-complex.html|accessdate=July 30, 2015|work=New York Times|date=May 12, 1995|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre, which had recently been used as a filming location for the movie ''[[Vanya on 42nd Street]]'', was dilapidated; it would take several years, and millions of dollars, to restore it to its original use and grandeur. The roof garden remained closed when  inspectors discovered that it could not meet modern building codes.

The New Amsterdam was officially reopened on April 2, 1997. In November 1997, after the premiere of the film ''Hercules'' and a limited engagement of a concert version of ''[[King David (musical)|King David]]'', Disney's stage version of ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' opened. On June 4, 2006, ''The Lion King'' closed in The New Amsterdam Theatre, moving two blocks uptown to the [[Minskoff Theatre]] on June 13, 2006. ''[[Mary Poppins (musical)|Mary Poppins]]'' began previews at the New Amsterdam Theatre on October 16, 2006 and opened on November 16, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.newyorktheatreguide.com/news/jun06/lionking2jun06.htm "The Lion King is moving theatre"] ''New York Theatre Guide'' (June 2, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; where it continued to run until March 3, 2013. The theatre was renovated to accommodate Disney's ''[[Aladdin (2011 musical)|Aladdin]]'', which was mounted in the theatre in 2014.

In 2008, The Roof Garden and 42nd Street office tower were renovated to become the home offices for [[Disney Theatrical Productions]].

==Box office record==

''[[Aladdin (2011 musical)|Aladdin]]'' broke the house record at the New Amsterdam Theatre for the week ending August 10, 2014, with a gross of $1,602,785.00. The previous record of $1,587,992.50 was set by ''Mary Poppins'' for the week ending December 30, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Gordon.

==Events==
The New Amsterdam has also hosted events benefitting ''[[Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS]]'', including the annual Easter Bonnet Competition, until the event moved to the [[Minskoff Theatre]].  The New Amsterdam is now home to BC/EFA's annual Gypsy of the Year Competition, the fall/winter sister event to the Easter Bonnet.  In recent years, the benefit's honored guest has been [[centenarian]] [[Doris Eaton Travis]], who originally performed on the New Amsterdam stage in the ''Ziegfeld Follies of 1919''.

In 1999, the [[Backstreet Boys]] televised a concert for [[Disney Channel]] called ''Backstreet Boys In Concert'' from the New Amsterdam Theatre. It was a prelude to their 1999-2000 [[Into the Millennium Tour]].

'''''New Humanism''''' or '''''neohumanism''''' were terms applied to a theory of [[literary criticism]], together with its consequences for culture and political thought, developed around 1900 by the American [[scholar]] [[Irving Babbitt]], and the scholar and [[journalist]] [[Paul Elmer More]]. Babbitt's book ''Literature and the American College'' (1908) first gave it a definite form; it was aimed at a perceived gap between the ideals of [[liberal arts college]]s, and university education as it actually existed. 

Babbitt himself did not accept the qualification ''new'' as applied to his [[humanism]], which became influential as a strand of [[Conservatism|conservative]] thought in the following years, up to the 1930s. Other authors associated with the New Humanist group included [[George Roy Elliott]] (1883-1963), [[Norman Foerster]] (1887-1972) and [[Stuart Pratt Sherman]] (1881-1926). Numerous attacks came from outside, especially during the 1920s.

This group was also at times known as ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' criticism, from More's time editing ''The Nation'' from 1909. The adoption by [[Seward Collins]] of its philosophy, or some trappings, in his publication ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' did something to tarnish it, in a way that external critics had up till then failed to do. Some of the members renounced the approach.

'''Pierre Marteau''' (French for ''Peter [[Hammer]]'') was the [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of a supposed [[publishing house]]. Allegedly located in [[Cologne]] from the 17th century onward, contemporaries were well-aware that such a publishing house never actually existed. Instead, the imprint was a fiction under which publishers and printers — in the Netherlands, France and Germany — evaded the open identification with books they published.

==History==
===Open pseudonym and political joke, spreading in the 1660s===
[[Image:Recveil-Marteau-1660.gif|thumb|180px|right|Probably the first Marteau-title: ''L'Histoire de Henry III'' (1660).]]
The first [[French language|French-language]] Marteau books appeared in the 1660s and were immediately identified as not actually being published by a man named Pierre Marteau residing in Cologne. The name would have been that of a Frenchman who had opened his shop outside France yet close to the French border. Cologne's geographical location smelled of political freedom — Marteau would avoid France's censorship by publishing outside France; Cologne promised access to the European market and the chance to get a good deal of the production smuggled back into France where it would sell on the black market for ten times the price.

French publishers, political dissidents and [[Huguenot]]s who had suffered political persecution under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] had opened their shops in [[Amsterdam]] and they would soon open new shops at [[The Hague]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Geneva]]. The [[Dutch Republic]] (a.k.a. the ''United Provinces'') and [[Switzerland]] protected Europe's [[Protestantism|Protestants]] of the [[reformed churches]], the minority among the three European confessions. These were the privileged countries French refugees tended to go.

[[Germany#The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (843–1806)|Germany]], a political entity of hundreds of little territories, half of them "Orthodox" [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Protestant]] half of them Catholic, which all together hardly ever united under the rule of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]], was only a third option. Some of the more liberal places like [[Hamburg]] ([[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] harboured sectarians and clandestine bookshops) and the university cities [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], [[Leipzig]] and [[Jena]] offered freedoms to critical intellectuals, yet only a few states like [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] openly sympathised with the reformed branch of Protestantism to which France's Huguenots belonged. Germany was a choice with disadvantages. Cologne, however, was of all the options Germany granted the worst, which was to become apparent at the beginning of the 18th century when most of Germany's territories joined the Dutch Republic and [[Great Britain]] against France in the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Great Alliance]] of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. The two [[Wittelsbach]]-ruled countries — Cologne and [[Bavaria]] — were the only important western European territories that supported Louis XIV.

The first Marteau books were French and most certainly printed in Amsterdam by publishers who would not risk to tell their names even in the Netherlands. Research has hinted at Amsterdam publisher [[Elzevier]] as the man who invented the imprint. It was, at first, just one among many openly misleading imprints. Unlike the usual obvious pseudonyms like "Jacques le Sincere", the name "Pierre Marteau" sounded real. The detail which gave away his virtuality remained on the reader's side — he would identify Cologne as the likely and yet unlikely place to go. "Hammer" made the joke a little bit more explicit: this man had courage and he was as real and as bold as a hammer.

Unlike other pseudonyms which appeared on only one title page, Marteau was to have a career that could be made only by a good joke and a complete lack of [[intellectual property rights]]. Numerous publishers began to sell books under the label. Remarkably, the uncoordinated joint venture was nonetheless able to produce a distinct publisher's identity. Only certain books attracted the imprint: French yet anti-French political satire, pirated editions, sexually explicit titles.

===German Marteau books and the European decades between 1689 and 1721===
[[Image:Historical profile of German Marteau-production.gif|thumb|left|Historical Profile of the German Marteau production, books per year]]
A second branch of Marteau books developed in the late 1680s when [[German language|German-language]] titles first assumed the curious imprint. 1689 became a landmark year, the year of the [[Glorious Revolution]] which had brought a Dutch regent onto the English throne. [[William III of England|William of Orange]], who had led the Dutch resistance against France in the 1670s, became William III of England, Scotland and Wales. Whilst France protected the deposed [[James II of England|Stuart Pretender]], William was particularly keen to move both the Netherlands and his newly acquired Britain into an anti-French alliance on Germany's behalf — Louis XIV had just attacked the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]; the [[Nine Years' War]] began —, the first phase of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Great Alliance]], a period German intellectuals would soon praise as the beginning of a thoroughly European age. German intellectuals had always admired France's intellectuals and the latest Parisian fashions, yet they had also felt uneasy about their love of France. Germany's critical voices complained, as they considered their own leanings towards France, that Germany had not produced any authentic German culture.

In the 1680s things changed. All of a sudden, one could be a German patriot and openly embrace French culture — if only one stressed the fact that France's intellectuals were by now mostly critical of their own country's political repression and ambition. French dissidents published political journals, newspapers and books outside France on the international market. Germans bought and imitated them after the events of 1689 without the slightest feeling of national disloyalty. The new French authors propagated the very Europe which had come to Germany's assistance. The Great Alliance against France was produced and supported by the French press of the Netherlands. Marteau was the publisher of the Great Alliance and the new modern Europe fighting France, the hegemonic power striving for a "universal monarchy" over all its neighbours. The Marteau label became fashionable, and German publishers adopted it: it flourished, with translations of French Marteau books and with original German titles now appearing under the labels of Marteau, his Widow, his Son, and a growing line of virtual family members continuing the business.

The peaks of the German Marteau production coincide with the political events Marteau covered. The beginning of the Great Alliance in 1689, its renewal on the eve of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1701, its end in a [[Tory]] victory in London 1709/10 and the succeeding [[Treaty of Utrecht|peace negotiations at Utrecht]], kept Marteau's political authors busy.

Europe turned out to be unreliable. English Tory politicians crafted the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which favored France's aspirations even though France had nearly lost the recent war. German intellectuals were unhappy with Europe, yet they still had to trust in Europe and to promote the European idea if [[Hanover]]'s King [[George I of Great Britain|George]] was to continue his aspirations to the English throne. He crossed the [[English Channel|Channel]] in 1714 and had to survive a phase of political turmoil in 1715 and 1716 — covered by Marteau with all the old anti-French political bias: France promoted the Stuart Pretender in his fight against the newly established German King. The Great Alliance gave way to the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]] of 1718-1720 in which Austria, France, Great Britain, and the United Provinces joined their forces to resolve the next European conflict. The fate of Europe remained on the political agenda until 1721, with the other half of Europe fighting the [[Great Northern War]]. The conflict about [[Sweden]]'s and [[Russia]]'s future power had begun in 1700 and involved northern and eastern Europe from [[Stockholm]] to [[Constantinople]]. It ended in 1721 and brought the European period of 1689-1721 to a silent end.

[[Image:La France Galante 1696.gif|thumb|Entertainment and politics: ''La France Galante'' (1696).]] 
Political books dominated Marteau's production. The peculiar ''Memoires pour rendre la paix perpetuelle en Europe'' appeared at one of Marteau's rivals in Cologne: Jacques le Pacifique published their first volume in 1712 ([[Immanuel Kant]] would refer to the outline of a union of European states at the end of the century in his famous treatise on a permanent world peace). Politics could hardly be separated from entertainment. [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer]] published her political gossip under the ubiquitous label. The secrets of the diplomats negotiating at Utrecht were a bestseller. Political novels like ''La Guerre d'Espagne'' (Cologne: Pierre Marteau, 1707) were extremely influential — the book mixed fact and fiction, sections of newspaper history with personal adventures of its hero, a virtual [[James Bond]] in the services of Louis XIV.

Satirical novels written by students in Halle, Leipzig and Jena claimed to be printed in Cologne. A pirated edition of the first German translation of ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' appeared under the imprint. The mixing of fact and fiction, information and entertainment, intellectual theft and scandal — the only possible answer to the censorship laws flourishing all over Europe — marked the Marteau production between 1660 and 1721.

===European publisher and German national icon===
A third phase of the Marteau production began after the European decades of 1689-1721 with the nationalistic turn of the 1720s and 1730s. Marteau's German production became pro-German and potentially anti-French, finding its peaks in the years of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

The 20th and 21st centuries saw only very few new Marteau publications, with the [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Peter Hammer Verlag in [[Wuppertal]]. The old publishing house's modern web-presence at pierre-marteau.com remains a virtual enterprise led by historians of the 18th century who use the label as a well established brand name to publish texts of the period 1650-1750 and research dealing with that period. {{third-party inline|date=March 2016}}

'''Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth''', or simply '''Professor''', is a fictional character in the American [[Animated series|animated television series]] ''[[Futurama]]''. Farnsworth is the [[mad scientist]] proprietor of the Planet Express delivery service, for whom the main characters work. He is the great (×30) [[Nephew and niece|nephew]] of [[Fry (Futurama)|Philip J. Fry]], the series' protagonist. He alternates between [[intelligence]] and [[Amorality|amoral]] [[Dementia|senility]] due to his greatly advanced age. He demonstrates a mastery of any field of science necessary for the series' plots, and is suggested to be one of the most brilliant [[inventor]]s on Earth. However, he falls asleep constantly, and he is implied to have routinely sent his former crews on [[suicide mission]]s.

==Character==
A self-described [[mad scientist]], the Professor is a [[senile]], amoral, deranged, and unpredictable old man (160 years old as of "[[A Clone of My Own]]"), with very thick glasses and a gift for creating doomsday devices and atomic supermen. He has put at least one [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] in peril with his inventions and visited dozens more (see "[[The Farnsworth Parabox]]").

The Professor teaches at [[Mars University]] and has worked for Momcorp on several occasions, but spends most of his time inventing ridiculous devices and sending the Planet Express delivery crew on [[suicide mission]]s. While at Momcorp, he fell in love with the CEO, [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]], only to leave her and Momcorp when she decided to weaponize his "Q.T. McWhiskers" toy. What he is a professor ''of'' is never explicitly stated. In the episode [[Mars University]] when asked what he is teaching, he responds: "The same thing I teach every semester, the mathematics of quantum neutrino fields. I made up the title so no student would dare take it"; however, this declaration has not precluded the professor from demonstrating mastery of whatever field of science is convenient for a given episode's plot, as shown in ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'' when he proclaims, "I can wire anything directly into anything! I am the Professor!", proceeding to link Hermes' disembodied head to the ship's computer. Approximately 100 years before the series' timeline, he taught a young [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Dr. Ogden Wernstrom|(not yet Professor) Wernstrom]], whom Farnsworth regarded as a prized student. After he returned a pop quiz to Wernstrom with a grade of A-minus (for poor [[penmanship]]), the two became bitter rivals (established in "[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]").

As [[Philip J. Fry]]'s great (x30) nephew, it is likely that he is the great (x29) grandson of Yancy Fry, Philip's brother from the 20th century. This would also make him the great (x28) grandson of Philip J. Fry II, Yancy's son, although his exact shared family members with Fry have not been stated. However, since Fry has become his own grandfather, he is also Fry's direct descendant, specifically his great (x32) grandson.

In "[[All the Presidents' Heads]]," he reveals that he is descended from [[Philo Farnsworth]] (widely credited as the original inventor of television); Dean Farnsworth, who created the [[Farnsworth Lantern Test]] to check for [[color vision]] problems in military aviators and sailors; and [[David Farnsworth]], a colonial-era counterfeiter who was eventually hanged for his crimes.

Many episodes' major plot points are introduced by Farnsworth announcing, "Good news, everyone!"—either to unveil his latest invention or describe the company's latest delivery assignment, which is usually a [[suicide mission]]; he acknowledges this in ''[[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|The Beast with a Billion Backs]]''.  On the very few occasions he has ''actual'' good news, he often opens with "Bad news, everyone!" After Fry resigns from his job in "[[Law &amp; Oracle]]", he states that he only says these phrases to make Fry "feel better about his pointless job." Another is his exclamation, "Sweet [[zombie]] [[Jesus]]!" He often says "Eh Wha?" when unaware of the situation, or when someone questions a statement he has just made. The Professor often makes mutually contradictory statements just moments apart; this happens especially often when briefing his employees, with the prevailing second statement canceling a much more reassuring first sentence.

The Professor rarely worries about the safety of the crew, viewing them as a means to an end, as evidenced in the first episode. After remarking that he was looking for a new crew for his intergalactic space ship, he was asked "What happened to your old crew?" His response was "Oh, those poor sons of... &amp;mdash; but that's not important! What is important is that I need a new crew!" Farnsworth's employees later discover that their predecessors died while gathering not-ordinary honey from Space Bees ("[[The Sting (Futurama)|The Sting]]"). The Professor issues his new crew the previous crew's career chips from a manila envelope labeled "Contents Of Space Wasp's Stomach" ("[[Space Pilot 3000]]").

Some of his more significant inventions include a hat that advanced a monkey to human-level intelligence, a race of mutant atomic supermen, a wide range of doomsday devices, and a pioneer in the development of the 'modern' robots used in the 31st century.

It was revealed in "[[Mobius Dick (Futurama)|Mobius Dick]]" that the first crew was ingested by a four-dimensional space whale in 2961, only returning to Earth when rescued by [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] in 3011. This appears to be the only crew the Professor showed some emotion towards, given his purchasing of a monument to honor the 50th year of their disappearance.

He frequently sends his crew on dangerous missions even when he has the foreknowledge that they will probably not make it back alive. His missions are typically those other delivery companies will not take, such as serving [[subpoena]]s to [[Mafia]]-controlled worlds or casual deliveries to [[virus]]-infested planets. Even the commercial that he had produced for his company makes several remarks to this effect, including "When other companies aren't crazy or foolhardy enough…" and "Our crew is replaceable, your package isn't."

In one episode when the crew and his ship are sent off to war, he immediately tries to hire another crew, going so far as to assign them similar character roles; he is clearly surprised to be interrupted by his old crew returning. Even his familial relationship to Fry does not dampen the glee with which he assigns dangerous delivery missions. When asked about the nature of his delivery "business", Farnsworth once clarified that he viewed his company more as "a source of cheap labor, like a family." He also frequently covets his employees' organs and blood; he keeps [[Amy Wong]] around because they share a blood type. In another episode, he tries to get [[Hermes Conrad]] to kill himself in a way that would not damage his liver because "other people need it".

It is established in the episode "[[Mother's Day (Futurama)|Mother's Day]]" that the Professor was once [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]]'s lover and employee. However, they could not maintain their relationship due to Mom's lust for power, prompting them to break up (this reportedly happened three times). When Mom takes control of all the world's robots to cause an uprising, her sons [[Mom (Futurama)#Sons|Walt, Larry, and Igner]] attempt to get the Professor to seduce Mom and retrieve the remote for the robots. They get back together briefly, but break up once more when Mom learns the Professor had been initially using her. It is revealed in ''[[Bender's Game]]'' that the Professor is the biological father of Mom's youngest son Igner&amp;nbsp;— the one whom Mom despises the most.

Many references to the pulp science fiction magazine ''[[Weird Tales]]'' indicate the Professor may be named in honour of its editor [[Farnsworth Wright]]. Another possibility is that he is named after the American inventor and television pioneer [[Philo Farnsworth]]  who appeared in the ''Futurama'' episode "[[All The Presidents' Heads]]" as an ancestor of the Professor and Philip J. Fry.

==Production==
Professor Farnsworth is voiced by [[Billy West]], using a combination of impressions of [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Frank Morgan]].&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news |author= |work=[[Fresh Air]] |title=Billy West: The Many (Cartoon) Voices In His Head |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128490848 |quote='He sort of fades in and out. ...

Farnsworth's design has been compared to a combination of [[Mr. Burns]], [[Grampa Simpson]], and [[Professor Frink]] from [[Matt Groening]]'s other series, ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800EFD61530F937A15752C0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2| title=Groening's New World, 1,000 Years From Springfield | author=Gates, Anita| date=1999-01-24| accessdate=2008-06-13| work= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; West has stated that the voice for Farnsworth is meant to be a bit shaky and that when developing the voice he came up with "a combination of all the wizard-type characters you heard when you were a kid, Burgess Meredith and Frank Morgan in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''." &lt;ref name="Futurama-rama"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/futurama-rama-welcome-back-to-the-world-of-tomorrow/| title=‘Futurama’-Rama: Welcome Back to the World of Tomorrow| author=Itzkoff, Dave| publisher= ''The New York Times''| date=2010-06-24| accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a direct nod to this in the episode "[[Anthology of Interest II]]", in which the Professor portrays the Wizard of Oz. In the initial storyboards of "[[Space Pilot 3000]]", Fry presumed that the Professor was descended from a supposed sister and a supposed brother-in-law named Eddie Farnsworth. In the first season, Farnsworth would excuse his unhelpfulness by saying that he was "already in his pajamas". This was an early attempt at a catchprase that was abandoned after the second episode, "[[The Series Has Landed]]".

In the "Action Delivery Force" segment of "[[Reincarnation (Futurama)|Reincarnation]]", Professor Farnsworth is voiced by [[David Herman]].&lt;ref name=VerroneStreamInterview&gt;{{cite web|last=Verrone|first=Patric|title=Futurama Writer/Co-Executive Producer Patric Verrone|url=http://thestream.tv/futurama-writerco-executive-producer-patric-veronne/|publisher=theStream.tv|accessdate=29 December 2011|quote='''Patric Verrone:''' Normally the voice of Professor Farnsworth, the leader of the Action Defense Team there, is played by Billy West. This was actually David Herman- who did the voice.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Puddle''''' is a [[woodcut]] print by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[M. C. Escher]], first printed in February 1952.

Since 1936, Escher’s work had become primarily focused on [[Paradox|paradoxes]], [[tessellation]] and other abstract visual concepts. This print, however, is a realistic depiction of a simple image that portrays two perspectives at once. It depicts an unpaved road with a large pool of water in the middle of it at twilight. Turning the print upside-down and focusing strictly on the reflection in the water, it becomes a depiction of a forest with a full moon overhead. The road is soft and muddy and in it there are two distinctly different sets of tire tracks, two sets of footprints going in opposite directions and two bicycle tracks. Escher has thus captured three elements: the water, sky and earth.

''''''Rejects Revenge'''''' was one of the longest running and popular professional touring theatre companies in the [[United Kingdom]].

==History==

Rejects Revenge was founded in Liverpool in 1990 by Ann Farrar, Tim Hibberd and David White. Ann studied English at Liverpool University; David was primarily a musician from Redditch who had come to Liverpool to seek fame and fortune in the home of the Beatles (they had unfortunately left by the time he arrived), and Tim moved from the Isle of Wight to study Medieval and Modern History. Ann and David met on a community theatre course at [[Hope Street, Liverpool|Hope Street]]; Tim met Ann when she joined The Network, an [[agit prop]] socialist theatre company based at the Trade Union Centre on Hardman Street. 
Their training consisted mainly of partaking in the numerous free workshops given by theatre practitioners at [[Hope Street, Liverpool|Hope Street]] in the late 80's/ early 90's, organised by Peter Ward. These companies and individuals, including [[Trestle]], the right size, [[Theatre de Complicite]], Peta Lilly, Mime Theatre Project, would usually then perform at Liverpool's [[Unity Theatre, Liverpool|Unity Theatre]] under the directorship, then as now, of Graeme Phillips.
In 1990 [[Everyman Theatre, Liverpool|The Everyman Theatre]] donated its space free for three nights for anyone on the Hope Street course who wished to perform. Ann asked Tim if he wished to create a piece based on the revolutions taking place in Eastern Europe at the time, and 'Staging The Revolution' became the first work they created together. David was introduced into the company later that year.
Much of their work began as [[devised theatre|devised]] pieces, but unlike many devising companies of the time, they were keen to turn this into a strict performance script, normally written by Tim. Their work was often very [[physical theatre|physical]], but the physicality of the words was always given equal weight.
After 15 years of national and international touring the company fell foul of the 2005 Arts Council cuts, and created its final production in that year. The company's archive now resides at the [[Museum of Liverpool Life]].

The Restaurant &amp; Bar Design Awards is an independent award system, set up by Marco Rebora &lt;ref name="Marco Rebora"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rebora|first1=Marco|title=Marco Rebora|publisher=Taschen|isbn=978-3836546683|url=http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/design/all/02882/facts.restaurant_bar_design.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008 in the [[United Kingdom]] with the encouragement of a panel of judges, including the editor-in-chief of [[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper*]], Tony Chambers.

Since the first awards in 2009 there have been over 5,000 entries from [[design]] and [[architectural]] industries and [[hospitality]] organisations around the world.

Each year the awards are judged by a new panel of representatives from the fields of [[art]], [[architecture]], [[design]] and [[gastronomy]].  Notable judges have included [[Ian Callum]], [[Mark Hix]],&lt;ref name="Mark Hix"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hix|first1=Mark|title=Chicken and Steak|url=http://www.cntraveller.com/recommended/food/restaurant-and-bar-style-awards|website=Condé Nast Traveller|publisher=Condé Nast Traveller|accessdate=1 Nov 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerry Judah]], [[Yotam Ottolenghi]], [[Thomas Heatherwick]], [[Julia Peyton-Jones]] and [[Karim Rashid]]. The winners are awarded at annual ceremonies at a chosen host venue affiliated with the award. In 2012 the ceremony was held at The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA).

Restaurant &amp; Bar Design Awards organises a year-round programme of events based in the UK and most recently Internationally with an aim to build a network between entrants, judges, partners and sponsors.
 
In 2014 [[Taschen]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiedemann|first1=Julius|title=Restaurant &amp; bar design|date=2014|publisher=TASCHEN|location=Köln|isbn=978-3836546683|url=http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/design/all/02882/facts.restaurant_bar_design.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; publications published a book, ''Restaurant &amp; Bar Design'' dedicated to the ongoing work of the Awards.

== Categories==
Each year the Restaurant &amp; Bar Design Awards acknowledges two overall winners under the categories of Best [[Bar (establishment)|Bar]] and Best [[Restaurant]].

The number of additional category winners varies each year. The inaugural award in 2008/2009 was open to entrants from UK and identified nine category winners. In 2009/10 the awards became International and introduced two more category winners under the titles International [[Restaurant]] and International [[Bar (establishment)|Bar]]. The awards also have a number of sub-categories.

'''''Saint Jerome Hears the Trumpet of the Last Judgment''''' is a 1779 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]].  

== Description ==
[[Jerome]], one of the four [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]], is depicted as a half-clad [[anchorite]] in his cell, with common iconographical attributes, a cross, a skull and bible. He is holding a [[quill]] in his right hand, indicating that he is writing the [[Vulgate]]. He is wearing the red garb of a cardinal, indicative of his role as secretary to [[Pope Damasus I]]. The skull skull alludes to this intellectual and penitential life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ|title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church|last=Cross|first=The Late F.

== Provenance ==
The painting came to Quebec City between 1901 and 1908,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; owned by Henriette and Geneviève Cramail.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-national-gallery-rebuffs-quebec-museums-offer-to-share-ownership-of/|title=National Gallery brushes off pitch from Quebec museums to share David painting|last=Hannay|first=Chris|date=April 17, 2018|work=|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After David's death in 1825, the painting entered the collection of Cardinal [[Joseph Fesch]], and then in the collection of  Cramail sisters' grandfather, the [[History painting|history]] and [[Genre painting|genre]] painter Gustave Mailand (1810-1880).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Sale ==
The parish of Notre-Dame de Québec, looking to raise operating funds, approached the [[Musée de la civilisation]], the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] and the National Gallery of Canada in 2016. The cost of the painting nearly equalled the entire acquisition budget of the National Gallery (8-million).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-national-gallery-preparing-to-cancel-chagall-sale-sources/|title=National Gallery preparing to cancel Chagall sale: sources|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Gallery of Canada has valued the painting at {{USD|5 million}}.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The asking price was {{CAD|6.3 million}}.

The National Gallery made in bid in December 2017 that was conditional on the sale of a Chagall painting at auction on May 15, 2018.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Musée de la civilisation]] and [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] have made attempts to raise funds to buy the painting together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Nathalie Bondil]], director of the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] has claimed that ''St. Jerome'' was not in danger of being sold to foreign buyers because that wouldn’t be allowed under Quebec’s Cultural Heritage Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/the-fraught-case-of-the-national-gallerys-plan-to-sell-a-chagall-painting/|title=The fraught case of the National Gallery's plan to sell a Chagall painting - Macleans.ca|last=Geddes|first=John|date=2018-04-14|work=Macleans.ca|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie Montpetit]], Quebec's Minister of Culture and Communications announced on April 23, 2018 that  the province of Quebec issued a notice of intent to have ''Saint Jerome'' classified as a heritage document.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/heritage-painting-quebec-ottawa-1.4632736|title=Quebec will grant French painting heritage status, bringing saga to an end {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fil-information.gouv.qc.ca/Pages/Article.aspx?idArticle=2604238852|title=Protection du patrimoine culturel québécois - Le Saint Jérôme de Jacques-Louis David maintenant protégé - Portail Québec|last=Québec|first=Services|website=www.fil-information.gouv.qc.ca|language=fr|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Françoise Lyon, chair of the board, and [[Marc Mayer]], director of the National Gallery said the gallery would halt its efforts to obtain the painting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Basilica of Saint Praxedes''' ({{lang-la|Basilica Sanctae Praxedis}}, {{lang-it|Basilica di Santa Prassede all’Esquillino}}), commonly known in Italian as '''Santa Prassede''', is an ancient [[titulus (Roman Catholic)|titular]] church and  [[minor basilica]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], located near the papal basilica of [[Saint Mary Major]]. The current [[Cardinal Priest]] of ''Titulus Sancta Praxedis'' is [[Paul Poupard]].

== History ==
The church in its current form was commissioned by [[Pope Hadrian I]] around the year 780, and built on top of the remains of a 5th-century structure and was designed to house the bones of [[Saint Praxedes]] ({{lang-it|S. Prassede}}) and [[Saint Pudentiana]] ({{lang-it|S. Pudenziana}}), the daughters of [[Saint Pudens]], traditionally [[St. Peter]]'s first Christian convert in Rome. The two female saints were murdered for providing Christian burial for early [[martyr]]s in defiance of Roman law. The basilica was enlarged and decorated by [[Pope Paschal I]] in c. 822.

Pope Paschal, who reigned 817-824, was at the forefront of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] started and advocated by the emperor [[Charlemagne]]. They desired to get back to the foundations of Christianity theologically and artistically. Paschal, thus, began two, linked, ambitious programs: the recovery of martyrs' bones from the [[catacomb]]s of Rome and an almost unprecedented church building campaign. Paschal dug up numerous skeletons and transplanted them to this church. The ''Titulus S. Praxedis'' was established by [[Pope Evaristus]], around 112.

The inscriptions found in Santa Prassede, a valuable source illustrating the history of the church, have been collected and published by Vincenzo Forcella.&lt;ref&gt;V. Forcella, ''Inscrizioni delle chese e d' altre edifici di Roma,  dal secolo XI fino al secolo XVI'' Volume II (Roma: Fratelli Bencini,  1873), pp. 489-524. &lt;/ref&gt;

The church provided the inspiration for [[Robert Browning]]'s poem "The Bishop Orders His Tomb at Saint Praxed's Church."

== Interior ==
[[File:Santa prassede rome.ogv|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Interior of Santa Prassede]]
The main altarpiece is a canvas of ''St Praxedes Gathering the Blood of the Martyrs'' (c. 1730-35) by [[Domenico Muratori]].

=== Mosaic ===
[[File:Byzantine mosaics, years 817-824.jpg|thumb|Byzantine mosaics, years 817-824]]
The most famous element of the church is the [[mosaic]] decorative program. Paschal hired a team of professional mosaicists to complete the work in the apse, the apsidal arch, and the triumphal arch. In the apse, Jesus is in the center, flanked by Sts. Peter and Paul who present Prassede and Pudenziana to God. On the far left is Paschal, with the square halo of the living, presenting a model of the church as an offering to Jesus. Below runs an inscription of Paschal's, hoping that this offering will be sufficient to secure his place in heaven.

On the apsidal arch are twelve men on each side, holding wreaths of victory, welcoming the souls into heaven. Above them are symbols of the four Gospel writers: Mark, the lion; Matthew, the man; Luke, the bull; and John, the eagle, as they surround a lamb on a throne, a symbol of Christ's eventual return to Earth.

Those  mosaics, as well as those in the Chapel of [[Saint Zeno]], a funerary chapel which Pope Paschal built for his mother, Theodora,&lt;ref name="chapel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arttrav.com/rome/santa-prassede-mosaics/ |title=The Chapel of Saint Zeno at Santa Prassede: mosaic revival and survival |publisher=ArtTrav |date= |accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the best-known aspects of the church. Also noteworthy are ancient frescoes. Ascending a spiral staircase, one enters a small room, covered in scaffolding;  on the wall is a fresco cycle, dating most likely from the 8th century. The frescoes probably depict  the life-cycle of the name saint of the church, Praxedes.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== Pillar of the Flogging ===

[[File:Monti - santa Prassede colonna flagellazione  01396.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Column of the Flagellation.]]

Santa Prassede also houses an alleged segment of the pillar upon which [[Jesus]]  was [[Flagellation of Christ|flogged and tortured]] before his crucifixion in [[Jerusalem]]. The relic is alleged to have been retrieved in the early 4th century  by Saint [[Helena (empress)|Helena]] (mother of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]]) who at the age of eighty undertook a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]], where she founded churches for Christian worship and rescued relics associated with the crucifixion of Jesus on [[Calvary]]. 

Among these legendary relics retrieved by Helena, which included pieces of the [[True Cross]] (now venerated at [[St. Peter's Basilica]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13369b.htm Basilica of St. Peter],&lt;/ref&gt; with fragments in [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]], also in Rome) and wood from the Jesus' crib enshrined at S. Maria Maggiore.  The authenticity of these relics, including the Santa Prassede pillar, is disputed by historians, due to lack of forensic evidence and the proliferation of falsified relics during the [[Middle Ages]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Titulus ==
Among known titulars of this see are Lambertus Scannabecchi (later [[Pope Honorius II]], c. 1099), Ubaldo Allucingoli (later [[Pope Lucius III]], 1141), [[Alain de Coëtivy]] (1448), Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte (later [[Pope Julius III]], 1542-1543), Saint [[Charles Borromeo]] (1538-1584), [[Rafael Merry del Val]] (1903-1930).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d1p11.html ''S.

'''Satyr plays''' were an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] form of [[tragicomedy]], similar in spirit to the bawdy satire of [[burlesque]]. They featured choruses of [[satyr]]s, were based on [[Greek mythology]], and were rife with mock drunkenness, brazen sexuality (including [[phallus|phallic]] props), pranks, sight gags, and general merriment.

Satyr plays are an independent genre, but they share many attributes with comedy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Shaw (C. A.) “Satyric Play. The Evolution of Greek Comedy and Satyr Drama.” ''The Classical Review'', 65 (2014): 358-360. (Print). {{ISBN|978-0-19-995094-2}}. DOI: 10.1017/S0009840X15001250.&lt;/ref&gt; Satyric drama though is one of the three varieties of Athenian [[drama]], the other two being [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]]. Comedy and Satyr drama are both founded from [[Komos|kômos]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It can be traced back to [[Pratinas]] of [[Phlius]], c. 500 BC. After settling in Athens, he probably adapted the [[dithyramb]], customary in his native home, with its [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of satyrs, to complement the form of tragedy which had been recently invented in Athens. It met with approval and was further developed by his son [[Aristeas (playwright)|Aristeas]], by [[Choerilus (playwright)|Choerilus]], by [[Aeschylus]], and others.

In the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Dionysia]], each playwright customarily entered four plays into the competition: three [[tragedy|tragedies]] and one satyr play to be performed either at the end of the festival or between the second and third tragedies of a trilogy, as a spirited entertainment, a comic relief to break the oppression of hours of gloomy and fatalistic tragedy. They were short, half the duration of a tragedy.  The general theme of heaven, fate, and the gods affecting human affairs in the tragedies was carried through into the festivities of the chorus of satyrs and [[Silenus|Sileni]], companions of [[Dionysus]].

==Origins==

The origins of performance culture and the emergence of the satyr play can be traced to ancient rural celebrations in honour of the god [[Dionysus]]. [[Rush Rehm]] argues that these inaugurated the "agricultural cycle of planting and harvesting" closely associated with Dionysus, who represented the embodiment of "a fundamental paradox inherent to the world, life-giving but potentially destructive."&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 12–13)&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the satyr play within the Festival of Dionysus is often times not noted to be as important as the tragedies presented at the festival; however, it is crucial to the dramatic arts and history to not downplay their importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffith|first=Mark|date=October 2002|title=Slaves of Dionysos: Satyrs, Audience, and the Ends of Oresteia|jstor=10.1525/ca.2002.21.2.195|journal=Classical Antiquity|volume=21|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satyr plays were composed of fantastic plots and mythological burlesque moments &amp; scenes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dramatic festivities at the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]] in [[classical Athens|Athens]], similarly dedicated to [[Dionysus]], required each playwright to submit three [[Tragedy|tragedies]] and a satyr play, which functioned as the last piece performed at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 39) and Lancelyn Green (1957, 11)&lt;/ref&gt; The accurate emergence of the satyr play is debatable; however, Brockett argues that most evidence “credits Pratinas with having invented this form sometime before 501 BC”,&lt;ref name="Brockett 1999, 17"&gt;Brockett (1999, 17)&lt;/ref&gt; which is supported by P. E. Easterling’s argument that by the 5th century the satyr play was considered an integral component of the tragike didaskalia.&lt;ref&gt;Easterling(1997, 40)&lt;/ref&gt;  Brockett also suggests the possibility that the satyr play was the first form of drama from which both [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]] gradually emerged.&lt;ref name="Brockett 1999, 17"/&gt;

[[Arthur Elam Haigh|A. E. Haigh]] however maintained that the satyr play is a survival from “the primitive period of Bacchic worship”.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh (1907, 16)&lt;/ref&gt; Haigh lists several examples of recorded entries to the City Dionysia: thus, in 472 BC Aeschylus won the first prize with ''Phineaus'', ''Persae'', ''Glaucus'' and the satyr play ''Prometheus''. Among Euripides’ entries, Haigh underlines ''Theristae'' (431 BC), ''Sisyphus'' (415 BC) and ''Alcestis'' which Euripides was allowed to present as a replacement of the traditional satyr play.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh (1907, 17)&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the evidence and information found regarding satyr plays and their history has been located through vase paintings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The mythological origins of the satyrs are closely linked to the advent of [[Dionysus]] into Hellenic culture. The satyrs and their female counterpart, the [[maenads]], were followers of Dionysus, a “late-comer to Olympus and probably of Asiatic origin”.&lt;ref&gt;Lancelyn Green (1957, 9)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roger Lancelyn Green, the satyrs probably began as minor nature deities, while their designated leader Silenus originated as a water spirit, a maker of springs and fountains.&lt;ref name="Lancelyn Green 1957, 10"&gt;Lancelyn Green (1957, 10)&lt;/ref&gt; Silenus was already an attendant to [[Dionysus]] when the satyrs joined the god’s following, and was subsequently proclaimed their father.&lt;ref&gt;Lancelyn Green. (1957, 10)&lt;/ref&gt; The satyrs characterised themselves by amorality, excessive drinking and the breaking down of traditional values and barriers.&lt;ref name="Lancelyn Green 1957, 10"/&gt; Eric Csapo and Margaret C. Miller further argue that satyrs have a strong connection with music and dance and consider them to be “archetypal musicians and dancers”,&lt;ref&gt;Csapo and Miller (2007, 21)&lt;/ref&gt; thus linking them to Dionysiac processions and the origins of performance culture.&lt;ref&gt;Csapo and Miller (2007, 22)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Dionysia went through a phase of change around the middle of the fourth century. This change brought with it a switch in the ways plays were performed. Plays were no longer performed in a completion/competition type setting. Satyrs were now performed outside of the Festival of Dionysus and were no longer subjected to the judgement among other plays. Satyrs and comedies became more relevant within the theatre community in the 430s. The new found prevalence came after Morychides began to forbid fighting-related activities on the stage. Satyr plays did have some influence on other forms of performance as well; of the most noteworthy is Middle Comedy. This time period for comedy brought with it the humbling of gods and heroes; which was done through the domesticizing of these characters within the different performances. Middle Comedy took on many of the factors of satyr plays but adapted the performances to be what was desired by the public at that time. These plays have been said to be performed well into the Hellenistic and Roman eras.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some consider the satyr play to be an extinct form of drama due to the lack of overall evidence from the past for these plays in comparison to comedy or tragedy. This creates a challenge of reconstructing the truth and history behind everything;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; however, with the below information, we can try to ensure that this dramatic performance style lives on.

==Structure and content==

The material for a satyric drama, like that for a tragedy, was taken from an [[Epic poetry|epic]] or mythology, and the action, which took place under an open sky, in a lonely wood, the haunt of the satyrs, had generally an element of tragedy; but the characteristic solemnity and stateliness of tragedy was somewhat diminished, without in any way impairing the splendour of the tragic costume and the dignity of the heroes introduced. The satyr plays generally took on topics that were popularized within society in the approach of a satyric farce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Satyr plays incorporated aspects of comedy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some well known examples are ''Heracles'', ''Agen'', and ''Menedemus''. The amusing effect of the play did not depend so much on the action itself, as was the case in comedy, but rather on the relation of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] to that action. That relation was in keeping with the wanton, saucy, and insolent, and at the same time cowardly, nature of the satyrs. The choruses in satyr plays usually involved the use of ''musically-inclined'' animals (such as monkeys). These animals were seen as a form of mockery for the ongoing issues in society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Victor Castellani, V “Ritual or Playful? On the Foundations of European Drama.” ''The European Legacy'', 14 (2009): 621-631. (Print). DOI: 10.1080/10848770903128786.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of persons in the chorus is not known, although there were probably either twelve or fifteen, as in tragedy. In accordance with the popular notions about the satyrs, their costume consisted of the skin of a goat, deer, or panther, thrown over the naked body, and besides this a hideous mask and bristling hair. The dance of the chorus in the satyric drama was called [[sicinnis]], and consisted of a fantastic kind of skipping and jumping.

The only satyr play to survive in its entirety is [[Euripides]]' ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'', based on [[Odysseus]]' encounter with the cyclops, [[Polyphemus]], in Book 9 of the ''[[Odyssey]]''. [[Aeschylus]] was noted for his satyr plays,&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 2.13.6&lt;/ref&gt; the largest fragment of which to have survived being his ''Dictyulci'' ('The Net Fishers') in which the baby [[Perseus]] is washed up on the shore with his mother [[Danae]] and is found by Silenus and the satyrs.  We also have large fragments of a satyr play of [[Sophocles]] called ''[[Ichneutae]]'' ('The Trackers'), in which the satyrs are employed by Apollo to track down his stolen cattle, and discover the baby Hermes. Smaller fragments of other satyr plays exist, and the genre continued to be written and performed as late as the 2nd century AD, though most have wholly vanished.&lt;ref&gt;West (1992, 281)&lt;/ref&gt; Even a fragment of music survives from a satyr play.&lt;ref&gt;Oxyrhynchus papyrus 2436; see Fragment 29 in West (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] did not imitate this kind of drama in their literature, although, like the Greeks, they used to have merry after-pieces following their serious plays.

==Costumes==
[[File:Actor as Papposilen Antikensammlung Berlin.jpg|thumb|right|''Actor as Papposilenus'', around 100 AD, after 4th-century BC original]]
A.E. Haigh writes extensively on costumes for the satyric drama. The chorus members all wore masks in accordance with Bacchic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh (1907, 290)&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reliable testimony is supplied by the Pandora Vase dating from the middle of the 5th century BC. On that vase, the satyrs are portrayed as half men and half goats, wearing goat’s horns on their heads, thus referring to the goat deities of the Doric type.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh (1907, 293–294)&lt;/ref&gt;

A later representation can be seen on the Pronomos Vase, found in Naples. The goatish element has disappeared and the satyrs resemble the old Ionic Sileni who were horse deities. The performers are wearing horse tails and short pants with attached phallus, a symbol of Dionysiac worship.&lt;ref name="Haigh 1907, 294"&gt;Haigh (1907, 294)&lt;/ref&gt; Haigh claims that the Doric satyrs were the original performers in Attic tragedy and satiric drama, whereas the Ionic element was introduced at a later stage.&lt;ref name="Haigh 1907, 294"/&gt;

== Characters ==
Men were typically portrayed in a heroic-type myth within the plot line. Heracles is a great example of a character that is representative of satyr plays. [[Heracles]] is usually around gods; however, his presence is one portrayed as very domestic and humanized in its appearance. Characters similar to Heracles and with similar roles as his are usually represented in relation to a musical performance. One of the elements that satyr plays contained was the consideration of "wild women". These were ''women'' that would dance with the satyrs and be called maenads. The movement of these characters within the plays was part of what began to create the basis from development of comedy. Additionally, these dances had variations that generally were parallel to the different forms of the dithyramb.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These plays were also filled with different types of singers. These singers at the Panathenaea were classified as traditionalists when looked at from an early Satyr play perspective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She is one of the pioneering women directors who worked regularly in mainstream Hollywood in the 1970s and 1980s (along with [[Elaine May]], [[Lee Grant]], [[Joan Darling]], [[Joan Micklin Silver]], [[Karen Arthur]], [[Gabrielle Beaumont]], [[Lela Swift]], [[Gwen Arner]], and [[Kim Friedman]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-18/entertainment/ca-8146_1_women-directors&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 she was the first woman ever to win the coveted [[Directors Guild of America Awards|Directors Guild of America Award]] (DGA Award) for directing a narrative (non-documentary) work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dga.org/Awards/History/1980s/1983.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1987-03-04/entertainment/ca-4583_1_dga-nomination&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/0704-Winter-2007-08/Celebrating-Excellence-DGA-Awards.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Born in [[Enid, Oklahoma]] and raised in [[Perry, Oklahoma]], Miller began writing and directing short films as a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cherokee-strip-museum.org/Beers/Beers-19950814.htm&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Oklahoma State University]] in 1971 with a degree in Theatre, she attended graduate school in Film at [[Northwestern University]].  In 1972, she went to Hollywood and worked as a [[script supervisor]], [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]], and [[Film editing|film editor]] before becoming a professional director in 1976 when she was hired to direct the [[NBC]] television series, [[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]].  This made her one of the handful of women directing in Hollywood at that time.

She has written and directed several short films, but the majority of her work has been in television where she has had a long and prolific career directing television movies and series.  Early in her career she studied with acting teachers [[Jack Garfein]], [[Harold Clurman]], and [[Jeff Corey]], and has demonstrated an ability to elicit strong performances from actors. [[Sharon Gless]], [[Cloris Leachman]] and [[Peggy McCay]] all won [[Emmy Awards]] under her direction, and [[James Stacy]] received an [[Emmy]] nomination.

In 1983 Miller won the [[DGA Award]], two [[Emmy Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;[[10th Daytime Emmy Awards#Outstanding Children.27s Entertainment Special]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Peabody Award]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-woman-who-willed-a-miracle&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Christopher Award]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000169/1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christophers.org/page.aspx?pid=217&lt;/ref&gt; for the Afterschool Special she produced and directed, ''[[The Woman Who Willed a Miracle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0237930/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Woman Who Willed a Miracle]]&lt;/ref&gt; This true-life drama is the story of [[Leslie Lemke]], the blind and mentally retarded boy with [[cerebral palsy]] who became world-famous as a [[savant syndrome|savant]] pianist.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/whatever-happened-to-leslie-lemke/&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the most well-known and honored of all Afterschool Specials, receiving [[Emmy Awards]] in all the major categories, in addition to numerous other awards.

In 1987 she was nominated for the [[DGA Award]] and an [[Emmy Award]] for directing two different episodes of the series, ''[[Cagney &amp; Lacey]]'' (''Turn, Turn, Turn'' part 1 and ''Turn, Turn, Turn'' part 2)&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-09/entertainment/ca-41609_1_dga-announces&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dga.org/Awards/History/1980s/1987.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10493">The term '''she-tragedy''', also known as "''pathetic tragedy''"&lt;ref&gt;The Ravishing Restoration: Aphra Behn, Violence, and Comedy  By Ann Marie Stewart&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a vogue in the late 17th and early 18th centuries for tragic plays focused on the sufferings of a woman, sometimes innocent and virtuous but often a woman who has committed some sort of sexual sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canfield|first=J. Douglas|title=The Broadview Anthology of Restoration and Early Eighteenth-Century Drama|year=2001|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=9781551112701}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent she-tragedies include [[Thomas Otway]]'s ''[[The Orphan (play)|The Orphan]]'' (1680), [[John Banks (playwright)|John Banks]]' ''[[Virtue Betrayed, or, Anna Bullen]]'' (1682), [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''[[The Fatal Marriage]]'' (1694) and [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]]'s ''[[The Fair Penitent]]'' (1703) and ''[[Lady Jane Grey (play)|Lady Jane Grey]]'' (1715). Rowe was the first to use the term "she-tragedy," in 1714.

== Overview ==
When English drama was reborn in 1660 with the re-opening of the theatres, the leading tragic style was the male-dominated [[heroic drama]] which celebrated powerful, aggressively [[masculinity|masculine]] heroes and their pursuit of glory, as rulers and conquerors as well as lovers. In the 1670s and 1680s, a gradual shift occurred from [[heroic]] to [[pathos|pathetic]] tragedy, where the subject was love and domestic concerns, even though the main characters might be public figures. After the phenomenal success of [[Elizabeth Barry]] in moving the audience to tears in the role of Monimia in Otway's ''The Orphan'', she-tragedy became the dominant form of pathetic tragedy and remained highly popular for nearly half a century.

The realm of pathetic tragedy became an exploration of the female experience as the private female sphere, that of the domestic, was put on the stage and publicized. The she-tragedies demonstrated the psychology and behavior of women in their private sphere and presented it for public consideration, a new concept that emerged as women began to star in main roles instead of only supporting characters. For the first time, plays were written that had a woman as the main character and that followed her experiences and emotions. She-tragedies brought what was once solely internal (emotions and thoughts) out for external display. The rise of pathetic tragedy commodified the female experience and women themselves with the transition from men (dressed as women) playing the female roles to women acting on the stage themselves. Actresses, while not unusual in Continental Europe, were just beginning to be accepted as a novelty by the predominantly male audience. The idea of the woman, occupier of the private sphere, as a public figure was bizarre. As a result, actresses often had a bad moral reputation as before the Restoration, public women were immoral women. However, royal sanction gave actresses more opportunities and opened the way for new dramatic possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe|first=Elizabeth|title='The First English Actresses: Women and Drama 1660&amp;ndash;1700'|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42210-9|pages=19, 25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components of She-tragedy ==
She tragedies are known for having focused on the hardships of women rather than those suffered by men. A she-tragedy during the 1680s derived its power from the ability to create titillating scenes that portrayed the suffering of an innocent woman.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Deborahh Payne (2000). The Cambridge companion to English Restoration Theatre. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Pathetic tragedies would begin by presenting the heroine and establishing that she was desirable. Unlike the other popular new genre, horror, the she-tragedy did not depend on violence and gore to become the spectacle of the heroine but rather used the physical suffering that was inflicted on the blameless female victims.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Jean I (2006). Fatal Desire: Women, Sexuality, and the English Stage, 1660-1720. Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-4447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women, who were the subject of the play, would usually become victims of adversity and crimes that sexually exploited them such as rape or unsolicited adultery. During the scenes of rape the woman would be abducted and carried off stage. The act of rape, or adultery, would be conveyed to the audience by screams from the woman as the villain completed the evil deed. After the scene the woman would return onstage. Evidences of ravished womanhood such as disheveled hair, disordered clothing, and phallic dagger were trademark of Restoration rape and prominent in she-tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Deborahh Payne (2000). The Cambridge companion to English Restoration Theatre. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Playwrights would utilize other ill fortune such as the loss of a husband or child and a single mother's struggle to raise her children as another means of causing hardship in the heroine's life. After suffering these hardships throughout the play the female protagonist would be overcome by madness, commit suicide or murder as a result of the burden with which she had suffered.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Susan J. (2001). A Companion to Restoration Drama. Blackwell Publishers. {{ISBN|0-631-21923-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of a she-tragedy was dependent upon the emotion that the actress conveyed to the audience, but the emotion that the audience felt as they watched the performance. She-tragedy also focused on making the heroine and not the hero the focus of the play. Attention would be placed on the female actress and her sexuality as playwrights used specific dialogue and devices to focus on the sexuality of the woman. One example of this is seen in The Orphan by Otway. In a scene Monimia is accompanied by a page who states to her 
"''Madam, Indeed I'd serve you with my soul;
But n the morning when you call me to you
As by your bed I stand and tell you stories,
I am asham'd to see your swelling Breasts, 
It makes me blush, they are so very white''." (1.221-25)
Here Otway is directing the audience's eyes to the actress' breasts, making her the focal point, and also sexualizing the actress and the character of Monima.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Jean I (2006). Fatal Desire: Women, Sexuality, and the English Stage, 1660-1720. Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-4447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in Political Propaganda ==
While she-tragedies were highly entertaining to the public, playwrights would also use them to voice political opinions. In Rowe's ''Jane Grey'' the character Jane represents a symbol of virtue whose desires are second to the political good. During the 1690s the rape in she-tragedies leaned towards Whig beliefs and became a symbol for the justification for displacing proper rule.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Jean I (2006). Fatal Desire: Women, Sexuality, and the English Stage, 1660-1720. Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-4447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spectacle of rape within the tragedy was used to convey the belief that the sexual assault on the female victim was a visual representation of assault on the subjects' liberties.

== Actresses and Royal Support ==
One reason that the Carolinian court was more accepting of the addition of women to the world of theater was the experience of the new monarch, Charles II, before he ascended to the throne.  As part of the English Civil War, the previous monarch, Charles II's father Charles I, was executed, sending his sons into exile. Charles II spent much of his exile abroad in France, living as part of the French court and learning French tastes and manners. Although practically unheard of in England, it was not uncommon for women to take part in French and Italian theater, which Charles II would have been exposed to. As a result, when he returned to England, Charles II did not have the same qualms as his countrymen when it came to the more public presence of women.

In addition, in 1662, a law was passed that women's roles were to be played by women and no longer by men. It is speculated that this change was at least partially due to the influence of the Puritans, who "took offence" &lt;ref&gt;The First English Actresses: Women and Drama, 1660-1700&lt;/ref&gt; at men cross-dressing to play women, something that goes against a verse from Deuteronomy in the Old Testament. Ironically, this attempt to reclaim morality in theater led to further scandals as the practice of "breeches roles" developed. These were roles played by woman while wearing men's clothing, either as part of a disguise required by the script or to give the actresses more license to behave as society allowed men to. These roles, while part of elaborate  plot, were sometimes used to exploit the physical aspects of women as men's clothing did not disguise the body's form as much as the dresses traditionally worn by women.

== Women In Tragedy ==
The new focus on women in tragedy may be linked with a growing political disillusion with the old [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] ideology and its traditional masculine ideals (see Staves). Other possible explanations for the great interest in she-tragedy are the popularity of [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], who often ruled alone in the 1690s while her husband [[William III of England|William III]] was on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], and the publication of ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', the first periodical aimed at women. Elizabeth Howe has argued that the most important explanation for the shift in taste was the emergence of tragic actresses whose popularity made it unavoidable for dramatists to create major roles for them. With the conjunction of the playwright "master of pathos" Thomas Otway and the great tragedienne Elizabeth Barry in ''The Orphan'', the focus shifted decisively from hero to heroine.

'''''The Feast of Venus''''' is a painting by Flemish painter  [[Rubens]], now in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna. It is a fanciful depiction of the Roman festival [[Veneralia]] celebrated in honor of [[Venus Verticordia]].

==Influences==
[[File:Worship of Venus (Peter Paul Rubens) - Nationalmuseum - 17602.tif|thumb|left|Rubens. The Worship of Venus (after Titian). c. 1630s. Nationalmuseum, Stockholm.]]
===Titian and Philostratus===
Rubens thought highly of [[Titian]] and made a copy of the Venetian master's ''[[The Worship of Venus]]'' which remained in Rubens' private collection until his death.{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=159}} Titian's work, in turn, was based on the ''[[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|Imagines]]'' of the [[sophist]] [[Philostratus of Lemnos]]. The ''Imagines'' consisted of a series of descriptions of ancient paintings presumably decorating a third-century villa near Naples.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2005|p=94}} In the description entitled ''[[Cupid|Cupids]]'' (''[[Erotes]]''), Philostratus portrays a "swarm" of cupids in a fragrant garden gathering [[Apple#Greek mythology|apples]], kissing the apples and throwing them back and forth, engaging in archery using themselves as targets since the arrows are arrows of love, wrestling, and chasing a [[Rabbits and hares in art#Antiquity|hare]] (a symbol of fertility). While the cupids are cavorting, nymphs are attending to a statue of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] that is garnished with a silver mirror, gilded sandals, and golden brooches.{{sfn|Philostratus the Elder|Philostratus the Younger|Callistratus|1931|pp=21-29}} Both Titian and Rubens in his copy depict most of this activity in great detail.

===Ovid===
The fourth book (April){{sfn|Ovid|}} of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' also served as inspiration for Rubens' ''The Feast of Venus''.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2005|p=94}}{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=160}} A portion of the poem describes a women's festival held on April 1 to honor both Venus Verticordia and [[Fortuna Virilis]]. Per Ovid, the festival includes the washing and decoration of a statue of Venus, ritual bathing under boughs of [[Myrtus#In myth and ritual|myrtle]], and offerings of incense to Fortuna Virilis so that the goddess may hide physical blemishes from the eyes of men.{{sfn|Ovid|}} The work, not always corroborated by other sources, portrays a somewhat conflicted account of the festival that blurs distinctions between class and the rite's purpose.{{sfn|Pasco-Pranger|2006|p=147}} Primarily, the cult was intended to turn a woman's heart from lust (''[[Lust|libidine]]'') to chastity (''[[pudicitia]]''){{sfn|Pasco-Pranger|2006|p=145}} so that she may retain her "beauty, virtue and good repute."{{sfn|Ovid|}} However, in addition to brides and mothers, Ovid includes "you who must not wear the [[Fillet (clothing)|headbands]] and [[Stola|long robes]]".{{sfn|Ovid|}} This is a euphemistic reference to prostitutes (''[[Meretrix|meretrices]]'') who were not allowed to wear the hairstyle and clothes of a respectable matron. Instead, they wore a short tunic and [[toga]]. Prostitutes were not being asked to embrace chastity, so their participation must have served other purposes.{{sfn|Pasco-Pranger|2006|p=149}}

==Composition==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Venus Feast (detail) - WGA20317.jpg|thumb|Detail of dancing nymphs and satyrs. The nymph on the far left was modeled by Rubens' wife Helena.]]
Rubens combined key elements of ''Imagines'' and ''Fasti'' along with details of his own invention to create a spirited allegory of conjugal bliss where "voluptuous sensuality is joined and enhanced by the propriety of marriage."{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=162}}

A statue of Venus Verticordia in a ''[[Capitoline Venus|pudica]]'' pose is the focal point of the work. She is surrounded by attendants who, in turn, are encircled by dancing and cavorting cupids, [[satyr|satyrs]], [[nymph|nymphs]], and [[maenad|maenads]]. Rubens includes all three of Ovid's classes of women in his work. The well-clothed matrons are shown performing rites. One washes the statue while the other, in an attitude of prayer, offers incense from a flaming tripod to Fortuna Virilis. The sea of dancing cupids has momentarily parted to allow two eager brides bearing dolls as offerings to rush to the goddess. The prostitutes are also present. Naked except for fluttering draperies, they stand at the foot of Venus. One clutches a comb while holding up a mirror so that the goddess can view herself.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2005|p=94}}{{sfn|Fehl|1972|pp=160-161}} The temple of Venus is shown in the background behind a grotto in which a stream of water cascades into an overflowing basin. Rubens does not depict any of the celebrants ritually bathing as described by Ovid, but the basin in the grotto alludes to that practice.{{sfn|Fehl|1972|pp=160-161}}

Rubens, like Titian, filled his canvas with a swarm of frisky cupids. Rubens applied his own distinct details to the [[Putto|amoretti]], however. Some of them are depicted as females without wings. Art historian [[Philipp Fehl]] has postulated the amorous couple in the right foreground accompanied by two pairs of doves represents [[Cupid and Psyche]], highlighting how marriage enriches love.{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=162}} Another winged cupid lowers a wreath of roses over the head of Venus in accordance with Ovid: "Now she’s given fresh flowers, and new-sprung roses."{{sfn|Ovid|}}{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=161}} The remainder of the cupids who are not dancing are collecting the apples of Venus as described by Philostratus as well as sheaves of wheat and clusters of grapes. The wheat and grapes are attributes of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Bacchus]] respectively and the gods they represent are shown as seated statues over the grotto. This detail adds to the lustful nature of Rubens' portrayal since a well-known adage immortalized in a play by [[Terence]] states: ''[[sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus]]'' (without food and wine, love grows cold).{{sfn|Fehl|1972|p=161}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|2005|p=95}}

The frolicking nymphs and satyrs in front of the grotto are a [[Bacchanalia|bacchanalian]] representation of pure erotic desire. Rubens used his young wife [[Helena Fourment]] as the model for the nymph on the far left. She is being held aloft by a leering satyr as she lewdly clutches his horns and stares out of the canvas with a knowing look.{{sfn|Chapman|2017|pp=461-462}}

'''''The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism''''' is 2003 book on [[literary history]], [[Literary criticism|criticism]] and [[Literary theory|theory]] by [[Brent Hayes Edwards]].

==History==
Edwards published ''The Practice of Diaspora'' with [[Harvard University Press]] in 2003.

==Subject matter==
''The Practice of Diaspora'' focuses on black writers in the [[interwar period]]. "Retracing the encounters between black intellectuals from both the [[Anglophone]] and the [[Francophone]] world in Paris, during the early to middle decades of the twentieth century, Edwards is able to make broader theoretical and historical claims for the role of translation in shaping [[Black diaspora|black diasporic cultures]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephens|first1=Michelle|title=The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism (review)|journal=MFS Modern Fiction Studies|date=Fall 2004|volume=50|issue=3|pages=792–794|doi=10.1353/mfs.2004.0090|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/172395|accessdate=9 August 2016|issn=1080-658X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards examines works by [[Alain LeRoy Locke|Alain Locke]], [[René Maran]], [[Claude McKay]], and [[Paulette Nardal]] among others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[W. E. B. Du Bois|W.E.B. DuBois]] serves as a point of departure for this transnational examination of black print culture. Edwards observes that DuBois first presented his famed argument, "The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the [[Color line (civil rights issue)|color line]]," not in his landmark 1903 text, ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'' (the usual attribution for that quotation), but in fact three years prior, at the 1900 [[Pan-African Congress]] in [[London]], explicitly framing the "color line" as an issue and a dialogue that crossed national boundaries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to the DuBois reference, Edwards also draws on [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and the concept of [[Articulation (sociology)|articulation]] to develop a theoretical use of the French word décalage, "referring to a shift in space or time or the gap that results from it, and applies the term to describe the way in which members of the black diaspora share similar conditions of oppression yet often find ourselves on opposite ends of the political spectrum—for example, black writers seeking solace from [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] in Paris, while simultaneously Africans were struggling against [[French colonialism]]. These countering political locations create tensions within our diaspora, but Edwards does not see these sites of difference as global movement killer...[instead] that these disparate locations are, like joints, sites of potential forward motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Kristina Kay|title=My Journey From Louisiana to Havana, and Back Again|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/my-journey-from-louisiana-to-havana-and-back-again/|accessdate=9 August 2016|work=The Nation|date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause''''' is a 2006 American [[Christmas film|Christmas]] [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[comedy]] [[adventure film]] directed by [[Michael Lembeck]]. It is the third and final film in the [[The Santa Clause (film series)|''Santa Clause'' film series]] following ''[[The Santa Clause]]'' and ''[[The Santa Clause 2]]''.

The film stars [[Tim Allen]] returning as Scott Calvin/[[Santa Claus]] and [[Martin Short]] as [[Jack Frost]]. Allen and Short had previously worked together in the 1997 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] comedy [[feature film]], ''[[Jungle 2 Jungle]]''. Most of the supporting actors from the first two films reprise their roles, with the exception of [[David Krumholtz]], who played Bernard the Arch-elf. As a result of his absence, Curtis (played by [[Spencer Breslin]]), who was previously the Assistant Head Elf, has now been promoted to Bernard's former position. Like the previous film, this film was shot in the Canadian cities of [[Vancouver]] and [[Calgary]]. This was [[Peter Boyle]]'s final film to be released before he died from cancer one month after its release. (The 2008 film ''[[All Roads Lead Home]]'' would be released posthumously.)

Its production was completed in February 2006. The movie was released in theaters on November 3, 2006 in the US followed by a release date of November 24 for the UK. The DVD and Blu-ray were released on November 20, 2007 in the U.S. and November 12, 2007 for the UK.

==Plot ==
Twelve years have passed since Scott Calvin took on the mantle of Santa Claus and became subject to the Santa Clause and married Carol Newman, who has now become a teacher in the North Pole. On Christmas Eve, she tells a group of young elves them a story of her life with Scott Calvin/Santa Clause while expecting their first child. Scott invites his in-laws, Sylvia and Bud Newman, to the North Pole, along with Scott's former wife, Laura, her husband, Neil, their daughter, Lucy, and Scott's son, Charlie. Meanwhile, he is summoned to a meeting of the Council of Legendary Figures, consisting of Mother Nature, Father Time, the Easter Bunny, Cupid, the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman, concerning the behavior of Jack Frost, who is jealous that he has no holiday or special occasion in his honor. Because he has been promoting himself during the Christmas season, Mother Nature suggests sanctions against him. When Scott says he is dealing with how to get the in-laws to come without revealing that he is Santa, Jack Frost negotiates a light sentence of community service at the North Pole, helping Scott and the elves put up various Canadian-themed paraphernalia, as Carol's parents believe Scott is a toymaker in Canada, which Scott agrees.

However, Frost's ultimate goal is to trick Santa into renouncing his position. When elf Curtis inadvertently reveals the "Escape Clause," Frost sneaks into Santa's hall of snow globes and steals one containing Scott as Santa. If Scott holds the globe and says, "I wish I'd never been Santa at all," he will go back in time and undo his career as Santa. When Lucy discovers this, Frost freezes her parents and locks her in a closet. He then orchestrates situations that make Scott think he must resign to make things better.

Frost tricks Scott into invoking the Escape Clause and both are sent to Scott's front yard in 1994, when Scott caused the original Santa to fall off of his roof and had to replace him. Frost causes the original Santa to fall off the roof and grabs Santa's coat before Scott can, making Frost the new Santa. Scott is sent back to the present day, where he has been CEO of his old company for the last 12 years and business takes priority over family. Scott also learns that Laura and Neil divorced and Carol moved away years ago.

Scott goes to find Lucy and Neil, who are vacationing at the North Pole, which Frost has turned into a tourist resort. Christmas is now "Frostmas", the elves are miserable, and the reindeer are confined to a petting zoo. When Scott finds Lucy and Neil, Neil states that Charlie didn't want him to be his father, causing the divorce between him and Laura. Scott confronts Frost and tricks him into recording his voice stating the Escape Clause. Scott has Lucy steal Frost's snow globe and bring it to him; when Frost finds out and takes the globe back, Scott plays the recording of Frost saying, "I wish I'd never been Santa at all", invoking the Escape Clause and causing Scott and Frost to be sent back again to 1994. Scott restrains Jack long enough to let the 1994 Scott get the coat, making him Santa Claus again and taking him back to the North Pole in the present, where no time has passed.

Scott reconciles with his family and Jack is arrested by elf police. He reveals he cannot unfreeze his victims unless he unfreezes himself. Scott convinces Lucy via a snow globe he had given her earlier of her warmly hugging a snowman, to give Frost a "magic hug" to unfreeze and reform him. It works, Laura and Neil unfreeze and Frost becomes a new person. The "Canada" ruse is dropped and Scott appears as Santa to Carol's parents. With two hours remaining before Santa must leave for his Christmas deliveries, Carol goes into labor.

Back to the present time, while Carol is telling the tale to her students, Scott walks in to reveal their baby boy, Buddy Claus.

==Reception ==

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 17% based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 3.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Playing Jack Frost as an evil cross between Liza Minnelli and Liberace, Martin Short is a welcome presence, but this tired series continues drawing from its bag of bland gags and dumb slapstick." On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 32 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-santa-clause-3-the-escape-clause |title=The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause Reviews |website=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title= The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause – CinemaScore |work=[[CinemaScore]]|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erid D. Snider wrote that Allen did ''The Santa Clause'' "The first time with enthusiasm, the second time with affection and the third time for a paycheck". [[Kyle Smith]] wrote, "We're getting a turkey and a ham for the holidays. Santa is so dumb he should be demoted to cleaning up after Geoffrey the Giraffe at Toys 'R' Us." [[Manohla Dargis]] dismissed the film as "Squeaky clean, but you might die of boredom." Finally, [[Mark Kermode]] described it on BBC Radio Five Live as "the cinematic equivalent of tertiary syphilis".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

'''WHUT-TV''', [[virtual channel]] 32 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 33), is a Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]) [[network affiliate#Member stations|member]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to the [[United States|American]] [[capital city]] of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, District of Columbia]]. The station is owned by [[Howard University]], an [[historically black college]], and is [[sister station|sister]] to [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[urban contemporary]] radio station [[WHUR-FM|WHUR]] (96.3 FM). WHUT's studios are located on the Howard University campus, and its transmitter is located in the [[Tenleytown]] neighborhood in the [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|northwest quadrant]] of Washington.

==History==
Channel 32 was founded on September 29, 1980 as '''WHMM-TV'''. The station was the first [[African-American]] owned and operated [[Public broadcasting|public]] [[non-commercial educational|educational]] station in the United States. In 1998, the station changed its [[call sign]] to WHUT, standing for Howard University Television, the station's branding.
[[File:WHUT-TV, Howard University.jpg|thumb|left|WHUT-TV station in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Since its founding, WHUT has won 11 [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] and 8 [[Communications Excellence to Black Audiences]] Awards. Despite this success, budget cuts have forced the station to roll back programming hours in recent years. As of October 21, 2007, digital channel 33 was on the air with a simulcast of the programming on analog channel 32. By November 21, 2007, the station had corrected an earlier problem with the lack of PSIP data so that digital receivers could lock on to it. Today, WHUT airs a variety of standard PBS programming, as well as programs produced by Howard University, and international programs focusing on regions such as the [[Caribbean]] and [[Africa]].

Soon after the start of preparations for the [[Broadcast incentive auction#Spectrum reallocation|2016-17 spectrum reallocation auction]], Howard University announced that it was considering the sale of WHUT-TV's channel 33 allocation in the auction in order to alleviate longstanding financial issues at the university. The station was entered into the auction when it began in March 2016. Because of WHUT-TV's status as the only black-owned public television station in the United States, the decision attracted sustained opposition from faculty and community members who feared the loss of a rare minority voice in public media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Howard University May Sell Rights to Its Public TV Station’s Spectrum |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/14/business/howard-university-may-sell-rights-to-its-public-tv-stations-spectrum.html |work=The New York Times |date=13 December 2015 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard announced WHUT-TV was withdrawn from the auction on February 16, 2017; the official reason was that the station's asking price had become low enough through the [[reverse auction]] process that it was apparent selling would not produce sufficient proceeds to justify ending operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Howard University decides it won’t sell WHUT in spectrum auction |url=https://current.org/2017/02/howard-university-decides-it-wont-sell-whut-in-spectrum-auction/ |work=Current}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Washington, D.C. TV stations became a test market for [[Mobile DTV]], and WHUT was one of the participating stations.&lt;ref name=Special&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/314792-Special_Report_Mobile_DTV_Heats_Up.php |title=Special Report: Mobile DTV Heats Up |last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-07-13 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WHUT-TV shut down its analog signal, over [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 32, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |title=DTV Tentative Channel Designations for the First and the Second Rounds |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]], digital television receivers display the station's [[virtual channel]] as its former UHF analog channel 32.

WHUT-TV commenced [[ATSC-M/H]] (Mobile DTV) broadcasting on February 27, 2011. WHUT-TV is the last remaining Washington-market broadcaster to broadcast an M/H signal. The signal nominally contains a feed of its main programming in standard definition on 32.1 and an audio feed of [[WAMU]] on 32.2, although neither stream contains audio or video data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHUT TSReader Capture 02/26/2018|url=https://rabbitears.info/atscinfo/dc-dca/27772-0_0.htm|website=RabbitEars.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walker and Weeks''' was an [[list of architecture firms|architecture firm]] based in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], founded by '''Frank Ray Walker''' (September 29, 1877 - July 9, 1949) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/w/walker-frank-ray|title=WALKER, FRANK RAY {{!}} Encyclopedia of Cleveland History {{!}} Case Western Reserve University|website=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History {{!}} Case Western Reserve University|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Harry E. Weeks''' (October 2, 1871 - December 21, 1935).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/w/weeks-harry-ellis|title=WEEKS, HARRY ELLIS {{!}} Encyclopedia of Cleveland History {{!}} Case Western Reserve University|website=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History {{!}} Case Western Reserve University|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Harry Weeks was born October 2, 1871, in W. Springfield, MA, the son of Charles F. and Clarissa Allen Weeks.  He attended MIT where he studied architecture in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] tradition, graduating in 1893.  He then worked for several prominent Massachusetts architectural firms before owning his own firm in Pittsfield, MA, for 3 years, where he would meet his future business partner. At the suggestion of John M. Carrere, a member of the Cleveland Group Plan Commission, Weeks moved to Cleveland in 1905, where he went to work for the prominent Cleveland architect [[J. Milton Dyer]] (1870-1957).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/w/weeks-harry-ellis|title=WEEKS, HARRY ELLIS {{!}} Encyclopedia of Cleveland History {{!}} Case Western Reserve University|website=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History {{!}} Case Western Reserve University|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Walker was born September 29, 1877, in Pittsfield, MA, the son of Frank and Helen Theresa (Ranous) Walker.  He also studied architecture in the beaux-arts tradition at MIT, from which he was graduated in 1900.  He subsequently moved to France to study at the Atelier of Monsieur Redon in Paris, and then lived a year in Italy. He returned to practice architecture in Boston, New York, and Pittsburgh before moving to Cleveland in 1905 to work for the firm of [[J. Milton Dyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/w/walker-frank-ray|title=WALKER, FRANK RAY {{!}} Encyclopedia of Cleveland History {{!}} Case Western Reserve University|website=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History {{!}} Case Western Reserve University|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After working together in Dyer's office, Walker and Weeks opened their own practice in 1911; the office continued to produce work even after Weeks's death, until the early 1950s.  As was often the case with architecture firms, Walker was the designer while Weeks was primarily the businessman. &lt;ref name="ech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=WAW|title=Walker and Weeks|date=1998-03-27|work=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]]|accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
The firm is most noted for its bank buildings;&lt;ref name=ech /&gt; several dozen were designed in the teens alone. Their best-known bank was the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland]], built in 1923. However, they also designed a wide variety of commercial, public, ecclesiastic and residential buildings, as well as a number of bridges, during the course of the firm's life. Walker and Weeks were responsible for the [[Indiana World War Memorial Plaza]] in [[Indianapolis]], which features a [[cenotaph]] based on the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos]].

Walker and Weeks frequently employed sculptor [[Henry Hering]] to create sculpture for their projects.

Like many architects the firm produced work in a variety of styles, from [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], Italian Renaissance and finally, the 1930s, ending in [[Streamline Moderne|Moderne]] and/or [[Art Deco]].

'''''What's it going to take?''''' is a British [[newspaper advertisement|print]] and [[billboard|poster]] campaign launched in 2007 by [[Women's Aid]] to boost awareness of [[domestic violence]] against women in the United Kingdom. The campaign, handled by [[advertising agency]] [[Grey London]], comprised photographs of nine female celebrities [[make-up|made-up]] to appear as though they were the victims of domestic abuse. The campaign received substantial media attention, with commentary appearing in ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', and ''[[Marie Claire]]'', among others. The ''What's it going to take?'' campaign went on to win a number of honours within the advertising industry, including prizes at the 2008 Creative Circle Awards and the Aerial Awards.

==Background==
[[Women's Aid Federation of England|Women's Aid]] was established in 1974 as an umbrella organisation for several [[feminism|feminist]] charities aiming to end [[domestic violence]] against women and children, including [[Sexual assault|molestation]], [[rape]], and [[sexual harassment]]. For the next thirty years, the organisation worked with a number of advertising agencies to promote its cause, including [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]],&lt;ref&gt;"Connections: OgilvyOne scoops Caples win for region", ''[[Media Asia Entertainment Group|Media Asia]]'', 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[McCann Erickson]],&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Jennifer; "[http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/230535/Poster-ad-uses-Boxing-Day-line-fight-violence/ Poster ad uses Another Boxing Day line to fight violence]", ''Brand Republic'', 13 December 2004. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mediaedge:cia]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/517312/Media-Strategy-Analysis---Tackling-domestic-violence-private/ Media: Strategy Analysis - Tackling domestic violence in private], ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 16 September 2005. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite numerous publicity campaigns over the years, by 2005 the charity's own research suggested that less than 16% of the public were aware of the existence of Women's Aid. Through a personal relationship between a pair of employees at the two organisations, Women's Aid were taken on as a [[pro-bono]] client by agency [[Grey London]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="probono"&gt;"[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-195481669/pro-bono-work-agency.html Pro Bono Work: Agency Viewpoint - Grey London (Contract with Women's aid)]", ''[[Marketing Week]]'', 12 March 2009.

Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first product of this new collaboration was the 2006 ''[[Valentine's Day (advertisement)|Valentine's Day]]'' campaign. With a budget of £500, Grey London made strategic purchases of media space in newspapers and radio with a reach of about 2% of the UK population. Through an effective [[public relations]] campaign, this exposure was leveraged to the point where 52% of British adults saw the advertisements at least once. The campaign went on to win a number of awards in the advertising community, including an [[Effie Award|EFFIE Award]] for Socially Responsible Advertising and an IPA Effectiveness Award.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=208378 Grey EMEA Lands Hat-Trick at EACA Euro Effies]", ''[[PR Newswire]]'', 27 September 2007. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;Sands, Marc; "[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/search/602959/IPA-Effectiveness-Awards-2006-Bronze-Awards/ IPA Effectiveness Awards 2006: Bronze Awards]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 3 November 2006. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the campaign was financially successful. Women's Aid recorded an increase of 25% in traffic to their website and a substantial increase in the number of donations following ''Valentine's Day'''s run.&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt;

==Campaign==
Looking to build upon the success of ''Valentine's Day'', Grey London began planning for a new campaign to run in early 2007. The brief for the campaign was to bring the issue into public view by making use of celebrities. In an interview with ''Creativity'' magazine, a planner for the agency said: "The amount of column inches and time spent talking about celebrities is phenomenal and if we could own even a small piece of this it would help to raise awareness of domestic violence and also Women's Aid. In this gossip driven world if we thought a celebrity was suffering from a form of domestic abuse EVERYONE would be talking about it."&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;"AdCritic: Print and Design", ''Creativity'', February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; From this came the idea of a series of portraits of female celebrities made-up to appear as though they had been the victims of abuse. Grey London recruited [[fashion photographer]] [[Rankin (photographer)|Rankin]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campaignlive.com/thework/news/885316/Womens-Aid-whats-going-take-Grey-London/ Women's Aid 'what's it going to take?' by Grey London]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 31 January 2007. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; known for his portraits of politicians and celebrities including [[Tony Blair]], [[Kylie Minogue]], and [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]],&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, John; "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/rankin-an-image-maker-at-the-cutting-edge-of-fashion-589849.html Rankin: An image maker at the cutting edge of fashion]", ''[[The Independent]]'', 3 May 2003. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; to conduct the shoot.

The team approached a number of women to star in the campaign but, due to scheduling conflicts and the lack of a campaign budget, securing dates for the photo-shoot proved difficult. In all, nine female celebrities, across a wide range of ages and ethnicities, were chosen: [[Honor Blackman]], veteran actress and former [[Bond girl]]; [[Fern Britton]], presenter of daytime television show ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]''; [[Fiona Bruce]], newsreader for BBC News;  [[Anne-Marie Duff]], known for playing Fiona Gallagher on television drama ''[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]''; [[Anna Friel]], known for playing Beth Jordache on the soap opera ''[[Brookside]]''; [[Jemma Wellesley, Countess of Mornington|Jemma Kidd]], former fashion model; [[Miquita Oliver]], television and radio personality; [[Fay Ripley]], known for playing Jenny Gifford in the comedy drama series ''[[Cold Feet]]''; and [[Kate Thornton]], journalist and television presenter.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;"Celebrities act to end domestic violence" (press release), [[Women's Aid]] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The head and shoulder prosthetics were created by Nigel Booth, whose previous work includes prosthetic and make-up design on feature films such as ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' and ''[[Blade II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Violence Against Violence", ''Creativity'', March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of the campaign on 1 February 2007 was celebrated with a launch party at [[11 Downing Street]] hosted by then-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] and his wife [[Sarah Jane Brown|Sarah]].&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt; All appearances in magazines, newspapers, posters, on television and on radio were donated free of charge, as was the work of the featured celebrities, photographer, and the advertising agency.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.womensaid.org.uk/page.asp?section=000100010010000600020001&amp;itemTitle=Celebrity+Campaign+FAQ's Frequently Asked Questions]", [[Women's Aid]] website (2007). Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In all, the campaign received an estimated £30m of media exposure,&lt;ref&gt;"Calling "Cut!" on Domestic Violence - How Women's Aid Used Celebrity to Change People's Minds" (case study), World Advertising Research Center (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; including an eight-page feature in [[women's magazine]] ''[[Marie Claire]]'' with an editorial written by [[Marian Keyes]].&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt;

===Reaction===
There was mixed reception to the campaign. Some were impressed with the impact of the images, such as Noel Bussey of [[Campaign (magazine)|''Campaign'' magazine]], who said:
"Many agencies pull out their best work when it's for charity, but rarely is it this effective, so well shot or so close to the brief. The images of battered female celebrities are bound to pick up coverage outside of the original media, and will not fail in raising awareness about the sickening problem of domestic violence."&lt;ref&gt;Bussey, Noel; "[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/search/630775/Diary-Pick-week---Grey-Womens-Aid/ Diary: Pick of the week - Grey/Women's Aid]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 2 February 2007. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others felt that the use of celebrities diminished the relevance of the message; Roisin Donnelly of [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] commented: "In this print campaign, the celebrities, complete with injuries provided by the make-up artist, do get attention, but it seemed like it was a trick just to get attention, and was focused more on the celebrity and fake make-up rather than the central issue of domestic violence."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/633759/Work-Private-view/ The Work: Private view]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 16 February 2007. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others were confused as to the point of the campaign; [[Kira Cochrane]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented: "The images were arresting, but odd. I can't imagine celebrity women posing as other sorts of victim: presenting themselves as trafficked women to highlight forced prostitution, or as rape victims to underline the low conviction rate. And what were the images supposed to tell us: that domestic violence is bad? Painful? Causes serious bruising?"&lt;ref&gt;Cochrane, Kira; "[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/03/domestic-violence-advertisement-keira-knightley Battered, Hollywood-style]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 April 2009. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, the campaign proved a moderate success. Grey London reported that at the height of publicity for the campaign, more than 67% of the British public were aware of Women's Aid and its goals.&lt;ref name="probono"/&gt; The ''What's it going to take?'' campaign went on to win a number of awards from the advertising and charitable communities, including an Aerial Award for the radio component,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aerialsfoundation.co.uk/ Archive: 2007 Winners]", Aerial Awards (2007). Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; a Silver Award at the 2008 Creative Circle Awards for the print component,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.creativecircle.co.uk/2008/silverhonours.htm Archive: 2008 Silver Honours]", Creative Circle Awards (2008). Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and Women's Aid were honoured as the Campaigning Team of the Year at the Charity Times Gala Awards.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.womensaid.org.uk/page.asp?section=0001000100190006&amp;sectionTitle=Our+awards Our Awards]", [[Women's Aid]] website (2007). Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, Grey London continues to produce work for Women's Aid; later in 2007, they collaborated again with Rankin to produce a second series of posters for the ''Valentine's Day'' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/633757/Work-New-campaigns---UK/ The Work: New Campaigns]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 16 February 2007.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}}
'''Winter guard''' is an indoor [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]] sport derived from military ceremonies or veterans organizations ceremonies. Unlike traditional [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]], Winter Guard is performed indoors, usually in a gymnasium or an indoor arena. Performances make use of recorded music rather than a live band or orchestra. Winter guard was invented in the United States, which remains the predominant scene for the sport.

Winter Guard ensembles commonly perform at judged competitions officiated by local and regional associations using criteria developed by [[Winter Guard International]]. In most states, they have a cadet guard and high school guard.

==Team roles==

A Winter Guard generally consists of performing members under the direction of an instructional staff. The staff of a winter guard team ("the guard") are drawn from many different specialties, which sometimes overlap: there are equipment instructors (sometimes one for the unit, sometimes broken out into the individual sections), dance instructors, and drill instructors. The equipment instructors create the choreography performed with equipment and teach it to the guard. The dance instructors create and teach the movement [[choreography]] in the show. The drill instructors focus on the position of the guard members relative to one another and to the boundaries of the performance area, in addition to where each member goes at which specific time during the performance. In some cases, all of these roles are fulfilled by one sole director.

A winter guard team usually has a captain, who is one of the performing members who leads and represents the guard. The captain may assume minor administrative duties and lead the team when instructors are not available. The captain is also the representative of the guard during awards ceremonies or retreat.

The number of members on a winter guard team varies widely from five to approximately 45.

==Performance conventions==

The duration of winter guard shows depends on the class in which the guard is performing. In competition settings, each winter guard team is allotted a set amount of time to set up staging (including a vinyl floor if the guard is using one, and any props associated with the performance), place all equipment, perform the show, and remove staging, props, and equipment. Setup and tear-down typically run two minutes each, and performances run around five minutes. Judges impose penalties on teams that run past the allotted time.

Unlike traditional [[Color guard (flag spinning)]] teams, which perform outdoors on a football field or parade route accompanied by a [[marching band]] or [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum corps]], winter guard teams perform indoors to recorded music.

In competitions, winter guard teams are judged in the areas of talent, precision, creativity, and horizontal orchestration (how all the elements create the larger picture/effect). Performances incorporate equipment, props, and dance moves.

Judges must keep a running commentary on a tape recorder or digital recorder. The judges record the score on a designated sheet to be reviewed by the individual guard instructor(s). After every one in a class has competed and their scores have been tallied, if the instructor(s) so choose they may meet with all the judges to discuss in depth why they received the score they did, ways to improve, what they are doing right etc. The goal of all parties involved, is to have the performers, staff, and the programs grow and learn.

==Equipment==

Three primary types of equipment are used in winter guard: flags, rifles, and sabres (other items can be used to demonstrate artistic effects.) Such equipment is used in shows to demonstrate a team's technical ability. Rubber tape, such as electrical tape, is often used to cover the equipment and give it a uniform appearance and protect it from damage during the activity.

===Flags===

The most fundamental piece of equipment in color guard or winter guard shows is the flag. While winter guard flags take many different sizes and shapes, a standard size is a six-foot pole (metal) with a Three-foot "silk", often of a custom design. Smaller flags called "swing flags" are shortened poles with large silks connected to them. These poles are often plastic so they move more fluidly. These flags are often incorporated into the artistic element of the performance, even though they are not practical for tossing or spinning, due to the weight and length of the silk. Other flags may range from 5 feet to 7 feet depending upon the intended effect of the piece of equipment. Longer flags are not practical to spin or toss but generally serve as holders for large pieces of material.

===Rifles===

Shaped similar to actual [[rifle|rifles]], the rifles used in winter guard are made of solid or hollowed-out lightweight wood and weigh 2&amp;ndash;5 pounds (about 1&amp;ndash;2.25 kilograms). Most winter guard rifles have a length of 30&amp;ndash;39 inches (about 76&amp;ndash;99 centimeters) and are composed of seven parts:
# The '''neck''' of the rifle. The neck is where the trigger would be on a firearm rifle. Right-handed drop-spins are performed using the neck of the rifle as the axis for the spin, and the neck is also used in common tosses.
# The '''bolt''' is a long silver or black strip of metal or plastic connected to the body of the rifle by screws, made to look like the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] on a firearm.
# The '''body''' of the rifle is the middle section and the majority of the mass of the rifle.
# The '''strap''', a long [[leather]] strap that reaches from the butt end of the rifle to about two-thirds of the way to the nose of the rifle. The strap has functional and visual purposes, and it is also used to produce a snapping sound. The strap is similar to a firearm's sling.
# The '''swivel''' or '''clip''' is the metal piece that attaches the strap to the body of the rifle. This is the most common location for left-hand placement when executing a regular left-handed toss.
# The final part of the rifle is the '''butt''', the heavier, back end of the rifle.
# The "tip" is at the end of the thin, long part of the rifle and is located on the opposite side of where the "butt" is.

Rifles can be made out of both [[wood]] and [[plastic]]. Some people prefer plastic because they are all the same weight and size, unless you order a bigger or smaller one. Others prefer wood because they're heavier and more durable. They are all exactly the same. Some people prefer wood because it is less slick and they can weight it the way they want to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/spotlight/all-about-accessories/plastic-vs-wooden-rifles/.|title=MARCHING.COM: All About Accessories - Plastic vs. Wooden Rifles|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plastic Rifles ====
Usually rookies, people new to color guard, will use plastic rifles. They tend to be a little more forgiving and easier to handle. Some people may not like plastic rifles because they can become slick and hard to handle, either when its raining or just from the sweat from the users hands. Some plastic rifles come with a manufacture guarantee that they will not break under normal usage. Because most are made out of a material called [[polyethylene]], this makes the rifle sturdy and harder to break. The material can also be colored so that different teams can use different colored rifles. Sometimes, though, the material can warp after several bad drops which can lead to a bad spin while the rifle is in the air. Plastic rifles may also start to smell after prolonged use, some say that after a long time it will tend to smell like sweat because of the performers hands. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/spotlight/all-about-accessories/plastic-vs-wooden-rifles/.|title=MARCHING.COM: All About Accessories - Plastic vs. Wooden Rifles|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wooden Rifles ====
Wooden rifles can be hard to use because they are all slightly different and may not be weighted the same, this is why people that are more familiar with rifles use them and not usually rookies. Most wooden rifles are made of either [[Populus|poplar]] or [[aspen]] wood. It is recommended to tape wooden rifles as to keep the ends protected and make it more durable, the tape can also be used for cosmetics. [[Electrical tape]] is the first choice of most winter guards because you can get the tape in whatever color is desired to match the show. Water is the main antagonist to wooden rifles, it can destroy a rifle and make it completely not usable, but if cared for properly and used correctly they can last for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/spotlight/all-about-accessories/plastic-vs-wooden-rifles/|title=MARCHING.COM: All About Accessories - Plastic vs. Wooden Rifles|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sabres===

[[Sabre]]s are elegant pieces of equipment used in winter guard. The length of sabres can range from about 30&amp;ndash;39 inches (about 76&amp;ndash;99 centimeters). They can either be plastic, metal, or plastic covered metal- though metal is more commonly used. Some metal sabres on the market are intricately decorated with engravings or etchings along the blade.  These more intricately designed sabres tend to be more expensive.

Sabres have two main parts: the blade and the hilt. The blade has a pointed but dull end, and the length of the blade is dull as well. Some winter guard team members wrap their sabres in electrical tape, as they do with rifles. As with rifles, a piece of black or non-white tape placed near the center of rotation is used as a "spotter", making it easier to locate the fast-moving blade while it is rotating in the air. Sabres are used primarily by more advanced guard members.

==Dance==

[[File:Winter Guard Preview Show 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|2012 Winter Guard Preview Show]]Guard members incorporate many different styles of dance into their shows. The most common styles of dance used are modern, contemporary, lyrical, jazz, and ballet. The different styles of dance are chosen depending on the different types of music chosen and the themes of the shows.  Dance is usually incorporated into the equipment work, and is performed seamlessly throughout the show.

==Winter Guard International==

[[Winter Guard International]] is not only a national competition but it is also an organization that has been around for many years. Unlike other traditional sports the rules and regulations have been changed and altered many times since the activity has started. There are judges who judge separate elements of a show – such as general effect, movement, equipment, and penalty points – and score the groups accordingly.

Because this activity not only exists in the United States but all around the world, major competitions worldwide are sanctioned and managed by Winter Guard International. This is the governing organization that makes and changes the rules and regulations for this activity. The rules that are written by WGI apply to every Winter Guard group competing in the World Championships no matter what country they are from. The World Championships are held every year in the United States. Most recently they have been held at the [[UD Arena|
University of Dayton Arena]] in Dayton, Ohio with some prelims and semi-finals held elsewhere around the Dayton area and Cincinnati area.

The phrase "Sport of the Arts" is frequently associated with WGI. Winter guard is described by saying "it brings music to life through performance in a competitive format."

==Divisions and classes==

Because not every color guard has the same skill level, population, or resources available, WGI uses a class division system to help remedy this.  There are two divisions, '''Scholastic''' and '''Independent'''.  These divisions include the classes (in descending order) Independent: Independent World Class, Independent Open Class, Independent A Class. Scholastic: Scholastic World,  Scholastic Open, Scholastic National A Class, Scholastic Regional A, AA, and AAA. Novice Class and Cadet Class.

Guard teams can be chosen to move to a higher class, but they can only move down a class after a period of inactivity or after a WGI review. For every competition, any team which achieves a score higher than a predetermined threshold is automatically moved up, or "bumped", to the class above its current position, even mid-season.

The '''Scholastic division''' is made up of guards that have members that all attend the same high school or a feeder school of that high school. There are many colleges and universities that sponsor their own winter guards as well, but these guards typically compete as Independent guards. Scholastic guards vary greatly in their ability and resources because they are more dependent on support from sources other than the members themselves, such as their school's band and school funding.

In the Scholastic division, there are three classes: '''Scholastic A''', '''Scholastic Open''', and '''Scholastic World'''. More divisions may exist at the local/regional level, such as Regional A, or Novice. In many places there is also a middle school class, often called '''Cadet'''. Scholastic A teams tend to be a step above the regional level and are the lowest level to compete in WGI. Scholastic Open teams are an intermediate level for competition. The Scholastic World division includes the highest caliber of winter guard teams.

The '''Independent division''' is composed of winter guard teams that do not associate themselves with a school (the exception being university teams). Additionally, these kinds of guards can be much more selective of their members, choosing to be gender-specific or to only have certain numbers of members.

In the Independent division, much like the Scholastic division, there are the three classes: '''Independent A''', '''Independent Open''' and '''Independent World'''.  The breakdown of skill level and placement mirrors that of the Scholastic division. There are age restrictions in the Independent A and Open classes. A member can perform with an Independent A class group if they are 22 or younger as of March 31 of that year. A member can perform with an Independent Open class group if they are 23 or younger as of March 31 of that year.

==Winter guard circuits==

Although the goal of many winter guards is to compete in the WGI World Championships, most guard competitions take place in regional winter guard circuits. One such circuit is the AIA circuit, or Atlantic Indoor Association circuit in which teams across Virginia, Washington D.C., and North Carolina participate. These circuits are loosely organized and may not be formally affiliated with WGI. In many cases the circuits predate WGI by a number of years. For example, the Midwest Color Guard Circuit celebrated their 50th anniversary season in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midwestcolorguard.com/ MidWest Color Guard Circuit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They may also have different competitive structures with additional classes to those in WGI. Circuit classes often will include beginner or novice guards such as '''Cadet''', '''Novice''', '''B''', '''Regional AAA''',  '''Regional AA''', '''Regional A''', and '''Regional Open'''. Circuits generally score using WGI standards and judges whether they are formally affiliated with WGI or not.

In addition, the winter guard activity is growing outside of the United States. In Europe, Color Guard Nederland (Netherlands) (CGN) and Winter Guard United Kingdom (WGUK) have recently affiliated with organizations from France and Germany to form the [[European Indoor Arts Alliance]] (EIAA) with the goal of creating a European Union-wide platform for the growth of the color guard activity in Europe, where the scholastic branch of the activity does not exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2500">A '''wonton font''' (also known as '''Chinese font''', '''chopstick font''' or '''chop-suey font''', '''type''' or '''lettering''') is a [[font]] with a visual style expressing "Asianness" or "Chineseness".

Styled to mimic the brush strokes used in [[Chinese character]]s, wonton fonts are often used to convey a sense of [[Orientalism]].

== Controversy ==
Some [[Asian-Americans]] {{who|date=November 2018}} find the use of these fonts offensive or racist, particularly when paired with caricatures which hark back to the [[Yellow Peril]] images of the late 19th century and 20th century. In 2002, the clothing retailer [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] experienced a public relations disaster when it produced a series of T-shirts with [[Sinodonty and Sundadonty|buck-toothed images]] and wonton font slogans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strasburg |first=Jenny |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2002/04/19/MN102999.DTL |title=Abercrombie recalls T-shirts many found offensive |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2002-04-19 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago Cubs were hit with backlash from the Asian community after a similarly offensive T-shirt was produced by an independent vendor in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=WITTENMYER|first=GORDON|title=Fukudome doesn't find racist T-shirts in Wrigleyville funny|url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/901817,CST-SPT-gordo18.article|accessdate=21 August 2013|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=April 18, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514064503/http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/901817,CST-SPT-gordo18.article|archivedate=May 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The questionable use of such fonts was recently the subject of an article in the ''Wall Street Journal'' by cultural commentator [[Jeff Yang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yang |first=Jeff |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/06/20/is-your-business-font-racist |title=Is Your Font Racist? - Speakeasy |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2012-06-20 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1173">'''État second''' ([[French language|French]] for ''Second State'') refers to the state of mind into which some writers go when writing short stories. It mixes abstraction and concentration at the same time, ironically telling sometimes more facts than in conscious writing. The Argentine writer [[Julio Cortázar]] often used this method to write, as he called it "the moment of maximum creativity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://triangulaciones2850.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_archive.html
