'''''Big Trouble''''' is a 2002 [[United States|American]] [[gangster film|gangster]] [[comedy film]] based on the [[novel]] ''[[Big Trouble (novel)|Big Trouble]]'' by [[Dave Barry]]. It was directed by [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] and featured a large cast including [[Tim Allen]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Dennis Farina]], [[Zooey Deschanel]], [[Sofia Vergara]] and [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]. Like much of Dave Barry's fiction, it follows a diverse group of people through a series of extremely strange and humorous situations against the backdrop of [[Miami]].

==Plot==

In a high-school game of "[[Killer:_The_Game_of_Assassination|Killer]]" (in which a student must shoot another with a squirt gun), Matt Arnold has to "kill" classmate Jenny Herk, and decides to sneak up on her at home. By [[coincidence]], hitmen are also there to assassinate Arthur Herk, who has secretly embezzled money from his company, Penultra Corp. When the fake [[assassination]] attempt crosses paths with the real one, police officers Monica Romero and Walter Kramitz are called out to the resulting disturbance. During the chaos of the assassination attempts, Matt's friend, Andrew, called Eliot Arnold, Matt's father. Upon arriving to pick up Matt from the Herks', Eliot immediately feels a mutual attraction to Anne Herk, Jenny's mother, as Matt and Jenny begin to feel attracted to each other as well. The Herks' housemaid, Nina, meanwhile, falls in love with a young homeless man named Puggy, who lives in a tree on their property, after she runs from the shootings and he saves her from the hitmen.

Realizing that he is the intended victim, Arthur visits arms dealers to buy a rocket but is sold a [[Suitcase bomb|suitcase nuclear bomb]] because the dealer claims to be out of rockets and doesn't tell him that it is a nuclear weapon. Escaped convicts Snake and Eddie, who were previously kicked out of the bar for disorderly conduct, hold up the bar and kidnap Arthur and Puggy (who is an employee there) and take the suitcase, not knowing its contents.

Meanwhile, Matt tries to "kill" Jenny in a mall parking lot, but a security guard thinks that Matt's [[Water gun|gun]] is real and opens fire on them. Matt and Jenny run away and eventually return to the Herk house, followed by officers Monica and Walter, who stumble across the confusion. Eliot is called over once again.

The convicts force Arthur to return to his home, where they capture everyone and tie them up. Taking Puggy and kidnapping Jenny, they leave (with the suitcase) for the Airport. Nina, who was hiding in her room, frees everyone except for Monica and Arthur (who were handcuffed to an entertainment system). Shortly after, the house is visited by two [[FBI]] agents who are tracking the bomb. They free Monica and have her lead them to the airport (leaving Arthur, as he was poisoned by a [[Psychoactive toads|hallucinogenic toad]], causing him to think that his dog is possessed by [[Martha Stewart]]).

The criminals pass through security with Puggy and Jenny, where the bomb is inadvertently triggered and its 45-minute timer begins; Puggy manages to escape in the confusion of boarding the plane. The FBI agents tell everyone that unless the bomb is retrieved soon, the plane must be shot down. Puggy leads the group to the criminals' plane, which Eliot sneaks onto. Meanwhile, the two hitmen get out of the traffic jam (caused by Snake and Eddie) and reach the airport. They bump into Officer Romero, and Special Agents Greer and Seitz, knocking the hitmen's Remington sniper rifle out of their golf bag in the process. Romero grabs the rifle, removes its bolt (rendering it useless), and returns it.

Eliot, having sneaked onto the plane, attacks the criminals by knocking Eddie out with a fire extinguisher and blasting the extinguisher at Snake. On hearing the case is a bomb, Eliot hurls it out of the still open rear door, only for Snake to leap after it. In a memorable feat of dumb luck, Snake manages to cling onto the door's steps. Despite Eliot's insistence that the case is a bomb, Snake opens fire on him which prompts Eliot to pull the emergency lever which decouples the door. Snake plunges into the ocean with a defiant smile, still clinging to the bomb, which explodes safely in the water. Eliot is congratulated by the FBI, promised he will receive presidential cowboy boots and a hat, and told the events that took place are strictly top secret.

The last scene reveals what happens to the main characters: after chasing down a plane, subduing two criminals, and saving Miami from a nuclear disaster, Eliot finally won Matt's respect. Anne and Eliot get married a week after Anne gets divorced from Arthur. Walter, after a forced strip search by the airport guards, becomes a male stripper and marries. The two hitmen manage to escape Miami after a series of very weird events. They claim their Miami job was the lowest point in their careers. They were surrounded by the fans of [[Florida Gators]] on their plane home (which was a constant joke in the film). Eddie goes back to jail in a prison outside of [[Jacksonville]], but becomes friends with another dimwitted inmate who shares the same affinity for crude jokes as Eddie does. Arthur is last seen still handcuffed and tormented by his dog.

==Cast {{anchor|Characters}} ==
* [[Tim Allen]] as Eliot Arnold – A divorced man, fired from his job at the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' and running a struggling advertising agency. His teenage son Matt thinks he is a dork.
* [[Rene Russo]] as Anna Herk – Jenny's devoted mother and the reluctant wife of Arthur (even though she thinks he's an idiot). She becomes immediately attracted to Eliot upon meeting him.
* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Arthur Herk – A rude and obnoxious man marked for death for embezzling from his company.
* [[Ben Foster]] as Matt Arnold – Eliot's son and the "killer" of Jenny. He also develops a crush on her.
* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Jenny Herk – Anna's daughter and a classmate of Matt. She is also Matt's target in the school's game "Killer".
* [[Tom Sizemore]] and [[Johnny Knoxville]] as Snake Dupree and Eddie Leadbetter – Two bumbling ex-convicts.
* [[Dennis Farina]] and Jack Kehler as Henry Desalvo and Leonard Ferroni – Two hitmen hired to kill Arthur for embezzling.
* [[Janeane Garofalo]] as Officer Monica Romero – A competent police officer.
* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Officer Walter Kramitz – Monica's incompetent fellow officer. Asks his partner Romero out on dates even though he's married.
* [[Heavy D]] and [[Omar Epps]] as Special Agents Pat Greer and Alan Seitz – Two FBI agents determined to retrieve a missing nuclear bomb.
* [[Jason Lee (entertainer)|Jason Lee]] as Puggy – A homeless wanderer who loves [[Fritos]] and Nina.
* [[Sofía Vergara]] as Nina – The Herks' teenaged Mexican housemaid. She falls in love with Puggy, who she initially mistook for [[Jesus]].
* [[Mike McShane|Michael McShane]] as Bruce – The consumer from hell who constantly belittles Eliot's advertisement ideas for his products. He suffers several indignities at the hands of other characters during the movie.
* [[DJ Qualls]] as Andrew Ryan – Matt's school friend and witness for when Matt "kills" Jenny.
* [[Andy Richter]] as Jack Pendick – A security guard with a drinking problem. He sees Matt pointing a squirt gun at Jenny and gives chase while shooting at them with his handgun. Richter also plays Rick, Jack's twin brother, an equally incompetent security guard at the airport. (In the novel the two are brothers but not twins.)

==Reception and controversy==

''Big Trouble'' was originally scheduled for release on September 21, 2001, and had a strong advertising push. The [[September 11, 2001, attacks]] of that year made the film's comedic smuggling of a nuclear device onto an airplane unpalatable. Consequently, the film was pushed back until April 2002, and the promotion campaign was toned down almost to the point of abandonment. ''Big Trouble'' came quietly to American theaters and left quickly afterwards, receiving mixed reviews and being generally ignored by audiences, becoming a [[box office bomb]]. It currently holds a 48% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 112 reviews, with the consensus reading "With its large cast and frantic comic pacing, Big Trouble labors for slapstick-style hilarity, but it never really gains steam."

==Differences between movie and book==

* In the book, Matthew Arnold, as well as female police officer Monica Ramirez, actually board the plane to rescue Jenny Herk. In the film, Monica Romero never boards the plane. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* The ending of the book was drastically different, with Walter being left handcuffed with Arthur, Henry and Leonard fighting off an escaped pet python at the airport, and a third police officer helping the FBI agents find the bomb. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* In the film, when Arthur is squirted with hallucinogens he believes his dog is [[Martha Stewart]] (who actually performs the cameo). In the novel, it is [[Elizabeth Dole]].&lt;ref name=baltsun&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-04-28/news/0204280398_1_blob-novel-toad |title=For a Hollywood premiere, you have to choose the dark blob that's the most flattering to you |author=[[Dave Barry]] |publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=28 April 2002 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations at ''Bilske Horodyshche'' (Більське городище) near the village of Bilsk (between [[Poltava]] and [[Sumy]]) in the Ukraine have led to suggestions by archaeologist Boris Shramko and others identifying it as the Scythian capital [[Gelonus]].&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2353">The '''Camden Professorship of Ancient History''' at the [[University of Oxford]] was established in 1622 by English antiquary and historian [[William Camden]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms]], and endowed with the income of the manor of [[Bexley]], becoming the first and oldest chair of history in England.  Since 1877 it has been attached to [[Brasenose College]], and since 1910 it has been limited to Roman history.

'''Ciudad Colonial''' (Spanish for "Colonial City") is the historic central neighborhood of [[Santo Domingo]] and the oldest permanent European settlement of the [[Americas]]. It has been declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/sites/526.htm UNESCO – Justification for Inscription]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as "Zona Colonial" (Colonial Zone) or more colloquially as "La Zona" (The Zone) . The Ciudad Colonial is located on the west bank of the [[Ozama River]], which bisects the city. It covers {{convert|1.06|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} bounded by a walled perimeter.

It is an important section of the city due to the high number of landmarks, including [[Alcázar de Colón]], [[Fortaleza Ozama]], [[Catedral de Santa María la Menor]], and others.

==History==

The first settlement of what is now Santo Domingo was established by [[Bartholomew Columbus]] on the East bank of the [[Ozama River]]. After the 1502 hurricane that claimed [[Francisco de Bobadilla]] among its victims, however, the city was relocated on the West bank under the leadership of [[Nicolás de Ovando]]. Ovando and his successor [[Diego Colón]] presided over the first constructions of the Colonial City, many of which still exist today. [[List of forts in colonial Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo's fortifications]] were an important feature of the urban landscape. The [[defense wall]] (''muralla'') extended from the [[Ozama River]] to the [[Puerta del Conde]], which was the entrance to the [[hinterland]] and the Western boundary of the city until the late 19th century.

[[File:Catedral Primada de America.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Interior view of Santa María la Menor Cathedral]]

The Spaniards used this settlement as the first point of influence in the Americas, from which they conquered other Caribbean islands and much of the mainland of the Americas. Santo Domingo was initially the political and cultural hub of Spanish presence in the new world, but after a few decades started to decline as the Spaniards focused their attention more on the mainland after conquering [[Aztec Empire|Mexico]], [[Inca Empire|Peru]], and other regions of Latin America. Ciudad Colonial nevertheless remained an important historical site.&lt;ref&gt;Santo Domingo; Fragmentos De Patria by Banreservas {{ISBN|99934-898-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1655, the Ciudad Colonial was submitted to a [[Siege of Santo Domingo (1655)|siege]] led by the English officers [[William Penn (Royal Navy officer)|William Penn]] and [[Robert Venables]]. The 1655 invasion was thwarted by Spanish troops commanded by the Captain General of the Colony, Don Bernardino de Meneses y Bracamonte, Count of Peñalva, to whom the [[Puerta del Conde]] ("Gate of the Count") is named after.&lt;ref name="Diario Libre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.diariolibre.com/noticias_det.php?id=234348|title=El Baluarte del Conde|publisher=DiarioLibre.com|accessdate=2010-07-28 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[defensive wall]] was modified during this episode. Prior to the invasion, there was a fort at the site where the [[Puerta del Conde]] is today, Fuerte San Genaro. It is believed that the modification that occurred after the siege involved the expansion of the wall to the fort, effectively creating a [[bastion]], ''El Baluarte del Conde''.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the city started to expand beyond its old boundaries but the Ciudad Colonial remained the main hub of activity until the [[Rafael Trujillo|Trujillo]] era. Trujillo also presided over the restoration of major monuments, including the [[Alcázar de Colón]] in the early 1950s.

==Colonial City today==

The Ciudad Colonial is now the main tourist attraction of Santo Domingo, even though the main sites of governmental and commercial activity are now in other parts of the city.

The central public space of the district is [[Parque Colon]], a square that borders the 16th-century Cathedral and has a late-19th-century bronze statue of [[Christopher Columbus]] in its center. East of Parque Colón, the [[cobblestone]] Calle Las Damas is the New World's oldest paved street, dating from 1502. The street is bordered by many of the zone's more prominent landmarks, including [[Ozama Castle|Fortaleza Ozama]], the site of major events in Dominican history; Casa de Bastidas, which now houses a children's museum; the French Embassy, in a building said to have been the house of [[Hernán Cortés]]; the Casa de Ovando, said to be the former residence of Governor [[Nicolás de Ovando]] and now a luxury hotel call [https://hodelpanicolasdeovando.com/en/ Hodelpa Nicolas de Ovando]; the [[National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic]]; and the [[Museo de las Casas Reales]], in the former governors' palace and [[Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo|Audiencia]] building.

[[File:Plaza España CCSD RD 02 2017 1991.jpg|thumb|[[Alcázar de Colón]]]]
Calle del Conde is a pedestrian-only street that includes several notable commercial buildings of the early 20th century and connects Parque Colon with the [[Puerta del Conde]] and Parque Independencia. Another traditional commercial district is the portion of Avenida Duarte just north of the Zona Colonial, which is currently undergoing a renovation plan that aims to make the area more appealing to [[tourism|tourists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariolibre.com/app/article.aspx?id=104323 Inician asfaltado avenida Duarte]''Diario Libre Online'' - Spanish&lt;/ref&gt;

On the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de España is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was one of the first commercial centers in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The [[Alcázar de Colón]], having once been the colonial palace of the [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] family—beginning with his son [[Diego Colón|Diego]]—is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.

A 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a [[Port#port of call|port of call]] for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Soucí Ports S.A.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seaportspr.com/viewir.cgi?newsletter_id=96&amp;article_id=3219&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that this ambitious project will boost the attraction of the Ciudad Colonial and the rest of Santo Domingo to international tourists.

In the Ciudad Colonial there are different places built by the Spaniards during the colonial era, which together form more than 300 historical sites in the area; these include various monuments of cultural and historical character, as well as houses of great figures of the society of that time, but it can not fail to mention important streets, such as the Las Damas street.

'''Colin François Lloyd Austin''', [[British Academy|FBA]] (26 July 1941 – 13 August 2010) was a [[Great Britain|British]] scholar of ancient Greek.&lt;ref name="Colin Austin obituary"/&gt;

==Biography==
Colin Austin was born in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], in 1941, the second son of [[Lloyd James Austin]] (1915–1994) and of Jeanne-Françoise (''née'' Guérin).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-lloyd-austin-1573482.html Professor Lloyd Austin's obituary in the ''Independent''].&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later the family moved to [[France]] and then to [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name =Ind&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hanley|first1=Eric|title=Professor Colin Austin|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-colin-austin-2077447.html|agency=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was educated at the [[Lycée Lakanal]], Paris, [[Manchester Grammar School]], [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where Sir [[Hugh Lloyd-Jones]] supervised his DPhil on Aristophanes. He won the Hallam Prize in 1961, the [[Browne_medal | Browne Medal]] in 1961 and the [[Porson Prize]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;''The International Who's Who 2004''. London and New York: Europa Publications, 2003, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 he was appointed lecturer in the Faculty of Classics at [[Cambridge University]] and worked there as the Director of Studies in Classics until 2008. From 1998 to 2008 Austin was a full Professor of Greek. In 1983 he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]]&lt;ref name="Colin Austin obituary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Colin Austin obituary|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/sep/06/colin-austin-obituary|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=19 December 2014|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235721/http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/sep/06/colin-austin-obituary|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
He died on 13 August 2010.&lt;ref name="Colin Austin obituary"/&gt;

Colin Austin's main works were related to [[Thesmophoriazusae]] by [[Aristophanes]] and [[Menander]]. Austin's commentary on [[Thesmophoriazusae]] was published by the [[Oxford University Press]] in a 2004 edition co-edited by S. Douglas Olson. Austin was the first publisher (1967) of the new portion of [[Euripides]]' tragedy [[Erectheus]], extracted from a mummy casing in Paris. He was also the first publisher (1969) of the first and third plays from the [[Bodmer Codex]] of Menander: [[Samia (play)|Samia]] "The Woman from Samos", "Aspis", and "The Shield". In partnership with [[Rudolf Kassel]], Austin started in 1983 the comprehensive edition of the Greek Comic Dramatists, "Poetae Comici Graeci". Volumes published up to 2001 provide some 4,500 pages of surviving texts of more than 250 authors with commentary.&lt;ref name="Colin Austin obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name =Ind/&gt;

'''Credibility''' comprises the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Subjectivism (philosophy)|subjective]] components of the believability of a source or message.

Credibility has two key components: trustworthiness and expertise, which both have objective and subjective components. Trustworthiness is based more on subjective factors, but can include objective measurements such as established reliability. Expertise can be similarly subjectively perceived, but also includes relatively objective characteristics of the source or message (e.g., credentials, certification or information quality).&lt;ref&gt;Flanagin and Metzger (2008), Digital media and youth: Unparalleled opportunity and unprecedented responsibility. In M. Metzger, &amp; A. Flanagin (Editors), Digital media, youth, and credibility (pp. 5–28). Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary components of credibility include source dynamism (charisma) and physical attractiveness.

Credibility online has become an important topic since the mid-1990s. This is because the web has increasingly become an information resource. The Credibility and Digital Media Project @ UCSB&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.credibility.ucsb.edu Credibility.ucsb.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507020501/http://www.credibility.ucsb.edu/ |date=7 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; highlights recent and ongoing work in this area, including recent consideration of digital media, youth, and credibility. In addition, the Persuasive Technology Lab&lt;ref&gt;[http://captology.stanford.edu Captology.stanford.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; at Stanford University has studied [[Stanford Web Credibility Project|web credibility]] and proposed the principal components of online credibility and a general theory called Prominence-Interpretation Theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://credibility.stanford.edu/pdf/PITheory.pdf Credibility.stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalistic credibility==
According to the Society of Professional Journalists [[code of ethics]], professional [[integrity]] is the cornerstone of a journalist's credibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp SPJ.org] (see Preamble)&lt;/ref&gt;
A journalist's number one obligation is to be honest.

According to Gallup polls, Americans' confidence in the mass media has been consistently declining each year since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Elizabeth Mendes |title=In U.S., Trust in Media Recovers Slightly from All-Time Low |work=Gallup |date=September 19, 2013 |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/164459/trust-mediarecovers-slightly-time-low.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press found that credibility ratings for major news organizations are at or near their all-time lows.&lt;ref&gt;The Pew Center for the People &amp; the Press, “Amid Criticism, Support for Media’s ‘Watchdog’ Role Stands Out,” The Pew Center for the People &amp; the Press, Aug. 8, 2013, http://www.people-press.org/2013/08/08/amid-criticism-supportfor-medias-watchdog-role-stands-out/&lt;/ref&gt;

“As audiences lose confidence in traditional news outlets, many see great promise in the Internet as a response to this crisis in journalism.” &lt;ref&gt;HEFLIN, K. (2015). The Internet Is Not the Antidote. Journalism History, 41(3), 165-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread use of the internet has helped motivate journalists to become more credible. The reason for this is because the competition of providing news increased when consumers had the chance and ability to choose the media that they consume through online sources. The internet has provided a chance for anyone to report news. In order to increase credibility, and therefore increase readers of their articles, journalists should be objective, accurate, trustworthy, and reliable.

Three aspects of credibility: clarity (how easily the article can be understood), accuracy (how well documented the information is), and trustworthiness (how believable the information is).&lt;ref&gt;Mosier, N. R., &amp; Ahlgren, A. (1981). Credibility of Precision Journalism. Journalism Quarterly, 58(3), 375-518.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic credibility==
Students perception of instructors has great importance and possible consequences.  Instructor credibility, which is defined as "the attitude of a receiver which references the degree to which a source is seen to be believable",&lt;ref name="mcc intro"&gt;McCroskey, J. C. (1998). An introduction to communication in the classroom (2nd ed.).Acton, MA: Tapestry Press.&lt;/ref&gt; consists of three dimensions-, competence, character, and caring.&lt;ref&gt;Teven, J. J., &amp; McCroskey, J. C. (1997). The relationship of perceived teacher caring with student learning and teacher evaluation. Communication Education, 46, 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Competence focuses on his or her expertise or knowledge in a subject matter.&lt;ref name="mcc intro"/&gt; Character refers to the "goodness" (i.e., honesty, trustworthiness) of an instructor.&lt;ref name="fry per"&gt;Frymier, A. B., &amp; Thompson, C. A. (1992). Perceived teacher affinity-seeking in relation to perceived teacher credibility. Communication Education, 41, 388-399.&lt;/ref&gt; Caring focuses on whether the instructor shows concern or empathy for the students’ welfare or situation.&lt;ref name="mcc intro"/&gt; Although an instructor may show one or two of these qualities, the best and most respected exude all three qualities.&lt;ref name="mcc intro"/&gt; A study done by Anders and Bronicki revealed that students who are taught by a instructor they perceive as credible, results in extreme allegiance to those instructors.

Generally, instructors who are perceived to have credibility is typically associated with effective teaching skills. Instructors who demonstrate competence, character, and/or caring are perceived to engage in a variety of effective instructional communication behaviors such as argumentativeness,&lt;ref&gt;Schrodt, P. (2003). Students' appraisals of instructors as a function of students' perceptions of instructors' aggressive communication. Communication Education, 52, 106-121.&lt;/ref&gt; verbal and nonverbal immediacy,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, S. D., &amp; Miller, A. N. (2002). A cross-cultural study of immediacy, credibility, and learning in the U.S. and Kenya. Communication Education, 51, 280-292.&lt;/ref&gt; affinity seeking,&lt;ref name="fry per"/&gt; and assertiveness and responsiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, M. M., Chesebro, J. L., &amp; Mottet, T. P. (1997). Students' perceptions of instructors' socio-communicative style and the influence on instructor credibility and situational motivation. Communication Research Reports, 14, 431-44i0.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, credible instructors are perceived to be low in verbal aggressiveness &lt;ref&gt;Martin, M. M., Weber, K., &amp; Burant, P. A. (1997, April). Students' perceptions of a teacher's use of slang and verbal aggressiveness in a lecture: An experiment. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Eastern Communication Association, Baltimore, MD.&lt;/ref&gt; and less likely to use behaviors that interfere with student learning.&lt;ref&gt;Thweatt, K. S., &amp; McCroskey, J. C. (1998). The impact of teacher immediacy and misbehaviors on teacher credibility. Communication Education, 47, 348-358.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike instructor competence which centers on instructors' perceived expertise,&lt;ref name="mcc intro"/&gt; instructor character and caring are rooted in students' perceptions of their instructors' interpersonal communication behaviors.  Students can feel more connected to the material being taught and have the information stay in their mind, if the instructor sharing the information has credibility.  According to studies, when instructors exemplify the qualities of character (i.e., kind, virtuous, good) and caring (i.e., empathetic, understanding, responsive), students report a greater likelihood of communicating with them.&lt;ref name="myers relat"&gt;Myers, S. A. (2004). The Relationship between Perceived Instructor Credibility and College Student In-class and Out-of-class Communication. Communication Reports, 17(2), 129-137. doi:10.1080/08934210409389382&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers who are concerned with whether students communicate with them, either in class or out of class, may want to reconsider the role their own in-class communication behaviors play in students' willingness or likelihood to communicate with them. Instructors who are interested in how students perceive their competence, character, and caring should examine how their in-class communication behaviors contribute to these perceptions. They can evaluate themselves, go back over their lectures, scores that students give them at the end of the semester, and seek advice and training from their peers. By doing so, instructors may find students are more willing, likely, or interested in communicating with them.

==Scientific credibility==
''Scientific credibility'' has been defined as the extent to which science in general is recognized as a source of reliable information about the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Bocking, Stephen |title=Nature's experts: science, politics, and the environment |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick, NJ |year=2004 |page=164 |isbn= 0-8135-3398-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been applied more narrowly, as an assessment of the credibility of the work of an individual scientist or a field of research. Here, the phrase refers to how closely the work in question adheres to scientific principles, such as the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alkin, Marvin C. |title=Evaluation roots: tracing theorists' views and influences |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif |year=2004 |page=134 |isbn=0-7619-2894-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method most commonly used to assess the quality of science is [[peer review]] and then publication as part of the [[scientific literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bocking, Stephen |title=Nature's experts: science, politics, and the environment |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick, NJ |year=2004 |page=165 |isbn=0-8135-3398-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other approaches include the collaborative assessment of a topic by a group of experts, this process can produce reviews such as those published by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/revstruc.htm What is a Cochrane review] ''The Cochrane Collaboration'', Accessed 5 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].&lt;ref name= Agrawala1998&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Agrawala |first=S. |year=1998 |title=Structural and Process History of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |journal=Climatic Change |volume= 39 |issue=4 |pages=621–642 |doi=10.1023/A:1005312331477 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/N302233443147421.pdf |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general public can give a great deal of weight to perceptions of scientific authority in their decisions on controversial issues that involve scientific research, such as [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name=Brossard2007&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Brossard |first1=Dominique |last2=Nisbet |first2=Matthew C. |year=2007 |title=Deference to Scientific Authority Among a Low Information Public: Understanding U.S. Opinion on Agricultural Biotechnology |journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research |volume=19 |issue=1 |page=24 |doi= 10.1093/ijpor/edl003 |url=http://ijpor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/1/24 |laysummary=http://www.news.wisc.edu/13734 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the credibility and authority of science is questioned by groups with non-mainstream views, such as some advocates of [[alternative medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |format= |last1=O'callaghan |first1=F.V. |last2= Jordan |first2=N. |year=2003 |title=Postmodern values, attitudes and the use of complementary medicine |journal=Complementary Therapies in Medicine |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=28–32 |doi=10.1016/S0965-2299(02)00109-7 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0965229902001097 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721085748/http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0965229902001097 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-21 |pmid=12667972 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; or those who dispute the [[scientific consensus]] on a topic, such as denialists of [[AIDS denialism|AIDS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith TC, Novella SP |title=HIV denial in the Internet era |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=e256 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17713982 |pmc=1949841 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040256 |url=http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040256 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210103636/http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0040256 |archivedate=10 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Epstein, Steven |title=Impure science: AIDS, activism, and the politics of knowledge |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1996 |isbn=0-520-21445-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of evolution {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}.

==Medical credibility==
People rely on doctors' expertise to respond to issues relating to their health. Trust in a doctor’s credibility is essential to a patient's health: depending on the patient’s trust in the doctor they will be more or less willing to seek help, reveal sensitive information, submit to treatment, and follow the doctor’s recommendations. According to numerous studies, done over 15 years we can conclude that we see a doctor’s credibility as having five overlapping characteristics: Fidelity, which is caring and advocating for the patient’s interests or welfare and avoiding conflicts of interest; competence, which is having good practice and interpersonal skills, making correct decisions, and avoiding mistakes; honesty, which is telling the truth and avoiding intentional falsehoods; confidentiality, which is proper use of sensitive information; and global trust, which is the irreducible “soul” of trust, or aspects that combine elements from some or all of the separate dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, M. A., Camacho, F., Dugan, E., &amp; Balkrishnan, R. (2002). Trust in the Medical Profession: Conceptual and Measurement Issues. Health Services Research, 37(5), 1419-1439. doi:10.1111/1475-6773.01070&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, it is easy to see what patients are looking for when it comes to a trustworthy doctor and the best way they can have their needs satisfied. There does seem to be a growing discontent with the medical field, however, because of for-profit drug companies that are influencing money behind the medical field. In 2002 a doctor attended the hearings of a drug company that was on trial for the death of adolescents who committed suicide while taking their antidepressants. Before the hearing studies had been filed with the FDA under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2002. These studies reflected a congressional effort to motivate drug companies to study the effects of medications on children. Since children are a much smaller market for new drugs, the pharmaceutical industry was suspected to not study them as much. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2002 was meant to strengthen drug companies credibility by rewarding those that performed pediatric studies. The law, however, did not require these pediatric studies performed to be publicized or published &lt;ref&gt;Diller, L. H. (2005). Fallout from the Pharma Scandals: The Loss of Doctors' Credibility? Hastings Center Report, 35(3), 28-29. doi:10.1353/hcr.2005.0058&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''New England Journal of Medicine'' study, 94% of American doctors have some relationship with a drug or medical device company, including payments but also drug samples and industry lunches, for example.&lt;ref&gt;A National Survey of Physician–Industry Relationships Eric G. Campbell, Ph.D., Russell L. Gruen, M.D., Ph.D., James Mountford, M.D., Lawrence G. Miller, M.D., Paul D. Cleary, Ph.D., and David Blumenthal, M.D., M.P.P. A National Survey of Physician–Industry Relationships. N Engl J Med 2007; 356:1742-1750. April 26, 2007 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMsa064508&lt;/ref&gt; Such alarming evidence is what has prompted a growing mistrust in medical professionals credibility. Despite the studies conducted intended on finding out how to increase doctors' credibility, the findings are inconclusive. It is a strong general consensus that increased visibility of the relationship between doctors and pharmaceutical companies is the first place to start.

We are seeing some progress towards transparency. The US Open Payments Act (Physician Payments Sunshine Act) has from October 2014 required drug companies to disclose payments to doctors, but it’s still does not give total transparency. There is a long way to go in establishing trust and credibility behind what the doctors recommend to patients. Being honest and showing that they are acting off their expertise instead of motivated by incentives given by pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;Wen, L. (2014). Patients can't trust doctors' advice if we hide our financial connections with drug companies. Bmj, 348(Jan15 6). doi:10.1136/bmj.g167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Street credibility==
Street credibility or "street cred" is the degree to which someone's word can be believed by the person on the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cred |title=Definition of cred |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations have gone through their own ways of getting street credibility; however, it goes by a different name: branding. This is a process in which companies spend billions of dollars a year and it is meant to convey information about a product, who is using it, and why you should too. They are targeting certain individuals as to increase their ability to grow their “street cred” so that the growth doesn’t end. From clothing to food, branding is used to assist companies improve their street cred and better sell a product.&lt;ref&gt;Seabright, P. (2001). Street Credibility for Sale: a Theory of Branding. Universite de Toulous, 1-21. Retrieved April 19, 2017, from http://idei.fr/sites/default/files/medias/doc/by/seabright/brand.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Men, L. R. (2012). CEO credibility, perceived organizational reputation, and employee engagement. Public Relations Review, 38(1), 171-173. doi:10.1016/j.pubrev.2011.12.011&lt;/ref&gt;

The CEO of the company is the face of what the public sees. A CEO helps illustrates the organization’s internal and external shareholders. CEOs are spokesmen who are actively visible and shape the corporate image. The role of the CEO is to influence employees' attitudes, perceptions, and performances through example of leadership and support.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Public Relations Research, 16 (2004), pp. 93–125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business leadership credibility==
CEO credibility is essentially made up of two important factors: knowing what you are talking about, or expertise; and being able to be trusted, or trustworthiness. One of the ways that a CEO’s expertise is measured is by the way his/her employees perceive them. If the CEO is seen as someone to whom the employees can go to for knowledge and help, this goes to show they have confidence that the CEO holds the skills necessary to help, and is thus valued in their position as such. The extent to which the employee gives their confidence to the CEO determines the CEO’s trustworthiness. An employee may totally embrace or quietly set aside the message of the CEO, these results measure the degree of trustworthiness there is in the CEO. The whole reputation of the organization represented by the CEO is built mainly by the experience of the employees as time passes. This reputation is carefully built by many factors experienced by the employees such as the actual services or products provided, certain money makers, work atmosphere, social aspects related to work and the overall foresight and ability to lead in a successful manner.

There is a natural connection link between the CEO and the organization. A CEO's credibility affects how employees view the organization's image. Employees who perceive the CEO as more qualified, competent, knowledge,  possessing more expertise, and skills tend to view the organizational reputation more positively. Employees who view the CEO as more honest and trustworthy tend to evaluate the organization in a positive manner.

The employees view of the organization completely intervenes the positive relationship between the CEO credibility and the employee’s involvement of engagement. Although the CEO's credibility positively affects employee engagement, the actual impact is exercised by the employee's view of the organization’s reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Men, L. R. (2012) CEO credibility, perceived organizational reputation, and employee engagement. Public Relations Review, 38(1), 171-173. doi:10.1016/j.pubrev.2011.12.011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Two-phase model of credibility ==
[[Jürgen Habermas]] in his theory of ''[[communicative action]]'' developed four validity claims (''truth'', ''sincerity'', ''appropriateness'' and ''understandability'') leading to the concept of ''credibility''.

In a different study&lt;ref&gt;Lock, Irina; Seele, Peter (2016): The credibility of CSR reports in Europe. Evidence from a quantitative content analysis in 11 countries. Journal of Cleaner Production. 122. 186-200. doi:10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.02.060&lt;/ref&gt; researchers empirically validated the claims and derived a two-phase model of "reporting credibility", where first of all ''understandability'' needs to be reached. Only then the three other validity claims make a difference and may lead to credibility in the [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5242">[[File:Corredor - Cueva de los Tayos.JPG|thumb|Cueva de los Tayos]]
'''Cueva de los Tayos''' (Spanish, "Cave of the [[Oilbird]]s") is a natural [[cave]] located on the eastern slopes of the [[Andes mountains]] in the [[Morona-Santiago]] province of [[Ecuador]].  It is sometimes called '''Cueva de los Tayos de Coangos''' (the Río Coangos is nearby), presumably to distinguish it from other oilbird-containing caves with similar names.

==Description==
Cueva de los Tayos is located in the high rainforest, 2&amp;nbsp;km south of the Santiago River, and 800 m west of Coangos River. According to the last GPS measurement in 2008, its altitude is 539 m above sea level. Located at an elevation of about 800 m within thinly-bedded [[limestone]] and [[shale]], the principal entrance to Cueva de Los Tayos is within a [[rainforest]] at the bottom of a dry valley. The largest of three entrances is a 65-meter-deep shaft leading to 4.6 kilometers of spacious passages and a chamber measuring 90 meters by 240 meters. The cave has a vertical range of 201 meters with its lowest point ending in a [[sump]].

The cave has long been used by the native [[Shuar]] Indians who descend into the cave each spring using vine ladders and bamboo torches to collect fledgeling tayos (the nocturnal ''[[Steatornis caripensis]]'').  Written references to the cave go back as far as 1860 and it is known to have been visited by gold-seekers and military personnel in the 1960s.

Actually, the cave is located inside the Sindical Center Coangos (formed by native people). So, the cave belongs to the independent territory of the Shuar-Arutam.

Today, access to the cave is restricted. It is necessary to obtain permission (access and temporary visit) and pay a tax (in order to improve life-condition of the communities) in Sucúa, Ecuador, at Shuar Center Federation. (FICSH: ''Federación Interprovincial de Centros Shuar'')

==Von Däniken popularizes the cave==
===''The Gold of the Gods''===
The cave was popularized by [[Erich von Däniken]]'s 1973 book ''The Gold of the Gods'', in which he wrote that János Juan Móricz (1923–1991) had claimed to have explored Cueva de los Tayos in 1969 and discovered mounds of gold, unusual sculptures and a metallic library.  These items were said to be located within artificial tunnels that had been created by a lost civilization with help from extraterrestrial beings.  Von Däniken had previously claimed in book ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' that extraterrestrials were involved in ancient civilizations.

===1976 BCRA expedition===
As a result of the claims published in von Däniken’s book, an investigation of Cueva de los Tayos was organized by Stan Hall of the United Kingdom, in 1976. One of the largest and most expensive cave explorations ever undertaken, the expedition involved over a hundred people, including experts in a variety of fields, British and Ecuadorian military personnel, a film crew, and former astronaut [[Neil Armstrong]].&lt;ref&gt;''BCRA Bulletin no 14'', British Cave Research Association, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;{{complete citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=Needs article title and page number(s), and (if applicable) the volume number; preferably also the author(s), if specified.}} The team also included eight experienced British [[caver]]s who thoroughly explored the cave and conducted an accurate survey to produce a detailed map of it.  There was no evidence of Von Däniken’s more exotic claims, although some physical features of the cave did approximate his descriptions and some items of zoological, botanical, and archaeological interest were found. The lead researcher met with Moricz's indigenous source, who claimed that they had investigated the wrong cave, and that the real cave was secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Stan |title=Tayos Gold: The Archives of Atlantis |series="Body, Mind &amp; Spirit" series |date=2015 |orig-year=2005 |publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIoVD1dVYK4C |via=Google Books |at=notably chapter 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 Gates expedition===
On 31 January 2018, Tayos Cave was featured on the 6th episode of the 4th season of ''[[Expedition Unknown]]'', titled "Hunt for the Metal Library". Explorer [[Josh Gates]] and his team, helped by local [[Shuar|Shuar Indians]] and Eileen Hall, daughter of Stan Hall of the earlier expedition, headed to Ecuador to explored the watery depths of the cavern.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/josh-gates-investigates-tayos-cave-and-the-metal-library-on-expedition-unknown/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Daensen folding chair''' consists of the metallic remains of a [[folding chair]] which were discovered in 1899 in sand from a [[Bronze Age]] [[tumulus]] near Daensen, a part of [[Buxtehude]], [[Lower Saxony]], Germany. The chair is the southernmost and most richly decorated example of the eighteen known folding chairs of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] in Northern Europe. The fittings, along with a reconstruction, are in the permanent exhibition of the [[Archäologisches Museum Hamburg|Archaeological Museum Hamburg]] in [[Harburg, Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Topic death, showcase No. 65 and 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Articus | first =Rüdiger  | last2 =Brandt | first2 =Jochen | last3 =Först | first3 =Elke | last4 =Krause | first4 =Yvonne | last5 =Merkel | first5 =Michael | last6 =Mertens | first6 =Kathrin | last7 =Weiss | first7 =Rainer-Maria | title =Archaeological Museum Hamburg Helms-Museum: A short guide to the Tour of the Times | series = Archaeological Museum Hamburg publication {{!}} Helms-Museum  | volume =103 | edition = | year =2013 | location = Hamburg | pages =90–91 | isbn =978-3-931429-24-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Daensen Backeslberg.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed tumulus ''Backelsberg'' from the south]]

The [[tumulus]] is located in a prominent location about 300 meters northwest of the village Daensen, at {{coord|53.424047|9.688783|type:landmark_region:DE-NI|display=inline,title}} in open countryside owned by former farmer and municipal mayor Eickhoff. The Bronze Age tumulus is known as {{lang|de|Backelsberg}} or {{lang|de|Baaksberg}} and according to local legend, contains the remains of a [[Chauci]] prince called Baak.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wegewitz | first = Willi | authorlink = | title = Der Klappstuhl von Daensen | journal = Hammaburg N.F. | volume = 8 | year = 1988 | pages = 36–37 | language = German | issn = 0173-0886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Back&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1994"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wegewitz | first = Willi | authorlink = | title = Der Klappstuhl aus Daensen | journal = Das Abenteuer der Archäologie | volume = | issue = | pages = 187–193 | publisher = Isensee | location = Oldenburg | year = 1994 | language = German | isbn = 3-89442-230-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1897, half of the northern [[mound]] was removed for sand extraction. In the centre of the mound Eickhoff's workers discovered a rectangular stone packing of boulders. Inside they found bones and a complete human skull. The workers gave the bones to a dog. Their work was witnessed by the [[Moisburg]] [[pastor]] Wittkopf who noted his observations in his [[Parish]]s book of accounts: 

{{quote|This hill was until 1879, removed from the north end half ago and it found a large oblong of unhewn granite, containing nothing special. Further more in the middle of a bunch of medium-sized boulders, about 4 feet high, on the shallow side of the same was lying residues of burnt human bones, a complete skull, with e.g. two very healthy molars and some other bones, which were not destroyed by fire, but by age. The skull was in the west, and there at the east there was a line gray ash-colored earth, without any epithets, and all this was overwhelmed with 3-4 feet of earth. N.B. Here lies the Germanic Chauci heros Back buried. Farmers Eickhoff's servants have profaned his rest and his head was thrown before a dog who abducted him. {{lang|la|Sic transit gloria mundi}}&lt;ref&gt;Wittkopf cited according to: {{cite book | last = Wegewitz | first = Willi | authorlink = | title = Der Klappstuhl aus Daensen | journal = Das Abenteuer der Archäologie | volume = | issue = | pages = 187 | publisher = Isensee | location = Oldenburg | year = 1994 | language = German | isbn = 3-89442-230-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1899 sand was again removed from the mound again, and this time the workers discovered a second stone circle. In its interior they found several bronze fitting and partially gold decorated fittings, including two {{convert|45|cm|in}} long stripes with gold inlays, which they broke into several pieces. In November 1899 Eickhoff forwarded a part of the fitting along with a ribbed armring of bronze to the museum. In 1934 the museum's director Willi Wegewitz acquired the remaining fittings from Eickhoff's sons, for the museum.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1994"/&gt;

== Findings ==
[[File:Klapphocker Daensen Klapperbleche.jpg|thumb|Bronze knob with rattle fittings]]

The remains of the folding chair consist of four bronze knobs with diameters of {{convert|36|to(-)|40|mm|in}} with {{convert|15|mm|in}} long spouts and a total length of {{convert|23|mm|in}}. The end caps are ribbed and their faces decorated with a pattern of four concentric circles. A cast loop with a diameter of {{convert|29|mm|in}} supports a ring of {{convert|28|mm|in}} diameter with four rattle  {{convert|73|mm|in}} long plates. These components were attached to the frame of the seat. Two small knobs with diameters {{convert|27|to(-)|29|mm|in}} and lengths of {{convert|18|mm|in}} were found among the baseboards of the stool. Most likely the stool had originally four of these knobs, the other two being presumed lost. There were also four bronze studs with gold plated heads. The nail heads are {{convert|18|mm|in}} in diameter and have a pin length of {{convert|27|mm|in}}. Three figure-eight shaped bronze fittings of {{convert|41|mm|in}} length, {{convert|15|mm|in}} width and thicknesses of {{convert|2|mm|in}} with line ornaments wearing a gold metal insert at the waist. The gold plate was fixed by two fine incisions in the bronze fitting and then folded on the reverse. Two rectangular bronze plates of {{convert|38|mm|in}} in length, {{convert|7|mm|in}} in width and about {{convert|1.8|mm|in}} thickness are entirely covered with gold foil and bent around the edges for fixation. Furthermore, there are five rectangular fitting plates whose broken edges were put together. It is most likely that some of their fragments are still missing. Only a few organic components were preserved, one is a piece of leather, and there were seven or eight pieces of wood, one of [[Fraxinus|ash]], the other of [[maple]]. Among the pieces of wood, there is a corner piece and one with the mounting of the seat's [[leather]].&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1994"/&gt; The remains of the  chair have been [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|typologically dated]] to {{circa}} 1400 BC.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"/&gt;

== Reconstruction ==
[[File:Vamdrup_folding_chair.jpg|thumb|Folding chair from Guldhøj (Denmark, 2nd half of the 14th century BC) as sample for the reconstruction of the wooden construction of the Daensen folding chair.]]
[[File:BronzeAgeFoldingChairDistribution.svg|thumb|Distribution of folding chairs of the Nordic Bronze Age.]]
Compared to earlier previous finds from grave mounds and [[Treetrunk coffin|tree coffin]] burials in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Mecklenburg]] the present metal objects were identified as fitting parts of a folding chair typically for the Nordic Bronze Age. These numerous comparative findings in connection with the survived wooden structures of the Vamdrup folding chair found at Guldhøj in the Danish municipality of [[Ribe County|Ribe]] in 1891&lt;ref&gt;[http://natmus.dk/en/historisk-viden/danmark/moeder-med-danmarks-oldtid/the-bronze-age/a-folding-chair-from-the-bronze-age/?cHash=813aa549da4173f208a1dc3c9efd457e A folding chair from the Bronze Age] [[Danish National Museum]] (retrieved on 2012-06-12)&lt;/ref&gt; allowed a precise reconstruction of the Daensen folding chair.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1994"/&gt;

== Interpretation ==
Due to the improper [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] and documentation of the find, precise statements about the [[archaeological context]] are not possible. The chair is the most magnificent decorated folding chair of the Nordic Bronze Age. This type of chair, or their fittings is present in 17 comparable finds. The remains of two folding chair fittings originate from [[hoard]]s, all the rest were [[grave goods]] from tree coffin or grave mound burials. Given the role of the stool in placing the sitter above others who are seated on the floor, it is possible that the individual buried in Daensen was a high-ranking person, a [[chieftain]] or religious official. The absence of further grave goods may indicate that the grave had been raided by antique [[Grave robbery|grave robbers]]. Comparably equipped graves with folding chairs typically included additional offerings such as weapons, jewellery, and household items, which are absent in Daensen. The ribbed bronze arm bracelet provided by farmer Eickhoff to the museum must come from a female burial, supporting the interpretation of the burial of a religious leader. Similar folding chairs originate from [[Ancient Egypt]], whose most famous specimen comes from [[Tutankhamun]]'s [[tomb]] of 1330 BC,&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1994"/&gt; demonstrating the extensive international connections of the later Bronze Age.

The [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull|eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland]] on 20th March 2010 affected the economic, political and cultural activities in Europe and across the world.

There was an [[Air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption|extensive air travel disruption]] caused by the closure of airspace over many countries affecting the travel arrangements of hundreds of thousands of people in Europe and elsewhere. Sporting, entertainment and many other events were cancelled, delayed or disrupted when individuals or teams were unable to travel to their destination.

The [[Death and state funeral of Lech Kaczyński and Maria Kaczyńska|state funeral]] of [[Lech Kaczyński]] and [[Maria Kaczyńska]] on 18 April 2010 was affected as some national leaders were unable to attend, including [[Barack Obama]], [[Stephen Harper]], [[Angela Merkel]], and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].

&lt;!--Please remember that this is a summary of the main article. Almost all new detail should go in the main article, not here.--&gt;Air travel and transport throughout the world was cancelled due to the [[airspace]] restrictions and the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA) estimated the airline industry worldwide would lose £130 million ($200 million) a day as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Wearden, Graeme |title= Ash cloud costing airlines £130m a day |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/16/iceland-volcano-airline-industry-iata |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= 16 April 2010 |accessdate= 17 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; IATA stated that the total loss for the airline industry was around US$1.7 billion (£1.1 billion, €1.3 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flight disruptions cost airlines $1.7bn, says IATA|date=21 April 2010|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8634147.stm|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Airport Operators Association]] (AOA) estimated that airports lost £80 million over the six-and-a-half days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Volcano ash cloud: winners and losers|date=25 April 2010|first=Alastair|last=Jamieson|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/7631576/Volcano-ash-cloud-winners-and-losers.html|accessdate=24 May 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 95,000 flights had been cancelled all across Europe during the six-day travel ban,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ash cloud chaos: Airlines face huge task as ban ends|date=21 April 2010|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8633892.stm|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with later figures suggesting 107,000 flights cancelled during an 8-day period, accounting for 48% of total air traffic and roughly 10 million passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Volcanic eruptions: Science and Risk Management|date=27 May 2011|first=Bente Lilja|last=Bye|work=Science 2.0|url=http://www.science20.com/planetbye/volcanic_eruptions_science_and_risk_management-79456|accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Air France-KLM]]'s and [[British Airways]]' requests to the European Union, and additionally in the latter's case to the British government, for compensation, [[Gordon Brown]] announced that the [[EU Solidarity fund]], designed to aid EU member states in the event of large-scale disasters, could be a possible source of compensation.&lt;ref name="BAcompensation"&gt;{{Cite news |title= British Airways seeks compensation for ash chaos |work=[[BBC News]]|date= 19 April 2010 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8629674.stm|accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's competition commissioner, [[Joaquin Almunia]], also said the EU was considering easing its rules on governmental subsidies to airlines.&lt;ref name="BAcompensation"/&gt; Late in April 2010, EU Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas said that governments would reimburse airlines for losses incurred,  however the Irish Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey said that Ireland would not do so due to the financial crisis.

The carmaker [[BMW]] said it was suspending production at three of its plants in Germany, because of interruptions in the supply of parts. As waylaid travellers scrambled for other modes of transport, ferry and railway companies enjoyed an unexpected bonanza, while some car-hire firms were reportedly hiking charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8633451.stm |title=Travel chaos persists despite easing of air lockdown |publisher=BBC News |date= 21 April 2010|accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== African economies ===
[[Kenya]] is reported to have destroyed 400 tonnes of flowers it was unable to airship into the UK on 19 and 20 April 2010. As a result, their economy was estimated to be incurring losses of $3.8m each day of the disruption.&lt;ref name=Mail-2010-04-19/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8629623.stm "Iceland volcano cloud: The economic impact"] BBC News, 19 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of [[Kenya]]n farm workers were temporarily [[Layoff|laid off]] as harvesting of flowers and vegetables was stopped by 19 April due to the grounding of flights. The [[Kenya Flower Council]] said 3,000 tonnes of flowers were destroyed and the Fresh Produce Exporters Association of Kenya called the situation "disastrous".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8629079.stm Volcanic flight ban hits Kenya farm workers] BBC News, 19 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zambia]]'s flower and vegetable industry lost about $150,000 (£98,000) a day. Other African industries, such as [[Uganda]]'s fish and flower export businesses, were also affected by the lack of air freight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8631439.stm |title=Zambia flowers and food exports hit by ash flight ban |publisher=BBC News |date= 20 April 2010|accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asian economies ===
[[Nissan]] declared a suspension in the production of three models in Japan on 21 April 2010 because supply of parts has been disrupted. It stopped production of 2,000 vehicles in two plants. [[Honda]] also announced a partial halt to production. Factories in China's Guangdong province saw air shipments of clothes and jewellery delayed. In South Korea, [[Samsung]] and [[LG]] were unable to air-freight more than 20% of their daily electronics exports and the Federation of Hong Kong Industries said hotels and restaurants in Hong Kong were facing shortages of European produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8631676.stm |title=Ash disruption causes Nissan to suspend some production |publisher=BBC News |date= 20 April 2010|accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia  economies ===
The New Zealand fisheries economy was helped by the disruption caused to air transport in Europe. Difficulties in bringing fresh [[salmon]] to international markets normally supplied by Norway and other northern European states have substantially boosted orders for New Zealand salmon.
Similarly the [[Netherlands]] is unable to supply [[Cymbidium|orchids]] for the start of the May wedding market in North America.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

[[File:Languages_of_Europe.svg|thumb|300px|Map of major European languages]]
'''Eurolinguistics''' is a neologistic term for the study of the [[languages of Europe]].
The term ''Eurolinguistics'' was first used by Norbert Reiter in 1991 (German equivalent: ''Eurolinguistik''). 
Apart from a series of works dealing with only a part of the European languages, the work of [[Harald Haarmann]] pursues a "pan- or trans-European perspective". This goal is also pursued by Mario Wandruszka.

Typological questions have mainly been dealt with by the ''Eurolinguistischer Arbeitskreis Mannheim (ELAMA; led by Per Sture Ureland)'' and the ''EUROTYP'' projects. Important sources of linguistic data for Eurolinguistic studies are the ''Atlas Linguarum Europae'' (for vocabulary studies) and the ''World Atlas of Linguistic Structures'' (Haspelmath et al. 2005, for grammar studies).

The internet platform ''EuroLinguistiX (ELiX)'' (edited by [[Joachim Grzega]]) offers a bibliography of Eurolinguistic publications as well as a wiki, a discussion forum, an academic internet journal in order to address also aspects of "linguistic and cultural history", "sociology of languages", "[[language politics]]" and "intercultural communication". In 2006, Joachim Grzega published a basic reader on common features of European languages.

Also joint with the ''ELAMA'', the ''EuroLSJ project'' by Erhard Steller tries to collect essential results of Eurolinguistics and make them usable for everyday life in Europe by transforming them into a representative standard language (''LSJ European / Europé LSJ'') which wants to serve as an optimized "acquisition and memory helper" (Giuseppe G. Castorina) for a quicker and easier access to all languages of Europe.

== Common features of European languages==

===Writing system===
(Sources and further information for this section: Haarmann 1991, Grzega 2006)

Writing was introduced by the Greeks and from there also brought to the Romans (6th century BC). There are five alphabets in regular use in the areas generally considered Europe. The [[Latin alphabet]] was developed into several scripts. In the early years of Europe, the [[Carolingian minuscule]]s were the most important variety of the Latin script. From this two branches developed, the [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]]/Fracture/German tradition, which Germans used well into the 20th century, and the Italian/Italic/[[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]]/Latin tradition, still used. For some nations the integration into Europe meant giving up older scripts, e.g. the Germanic gave up the runes ([[Runic alphabet|Futhark]]) (3rd to 17th centuries), the Irish the [[Ogham]] script (4th to 7th centuries). The [[Cyrillic script]] is the second most widespread alphabet in Europe, and was developed in the 9th century under the influence of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] alphabets.  Both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets are used for multiple languages in multiple states, both inside and outside Europe.  As well as these two, there are three alphabets used primarily for a single language, although they are occasionally applied to minority languages in the states from which they originate.  The oldest of these alphabets is the [[Greek alphabet]], which could be considered the progenitor of all the surviving alphabets of Europe, with the earliest recorded inscriptions appearing in the 9th century BC.  The other two are both found in the [[Caucasus]], both originating in the 5th century.  The [[Georgian alphabet]] is used  primarily to write Georgian, though it is also used to write the other Kartvelian languages, [[Svan language|Svan]], [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]] and [[Laz language|Laz]], all of which are found largely within the borders of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].  The [[Armenian alphabet]] is used to write the [[Armenian language]], which has two dialects, and has been used to write [[Turkish language|Turkish]] in the past.

===Sound features===
(Sources and further information for this section: Haarmann 1973, Asher 1994, Price 1998, Grzega 2006)

The sound systems of languages may differ considerably between languages. European languages can thus rather be characterized negatively, e.g. by the absence of [[click consonant|click sounds]]. One could also think of specific [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] features, such as [[tonal language|tonal]] accents. But there are also tonal languages in Europe: [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] (e.g. ''lètī'' ‘he flies, is flying’ with long rising accent vs. ''lêta'' ‘years’ with long falling accent) and [[Slovene language|Slovene]] (e.g. ''sûda'' ‘of the vessel’ with long falling accent vs. ''súda'' ‘of the court’ with long rising accent). In Slovene, the use of the musical accent is declining though (cf. Rehder 1998: 234) --but there are hardly any contexts where intelligibility is endangered. In Sweden [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (but not in [[Finland Swedish]]) there also is a pitch accent in some words, which can be meaningful, e.g. ''´anden'' ‘the duck’ vs. ''ˇanden'' ‘the ghost, spirit’.

===Grammatical features===
(Sources and further information for this section: Asher 1994, Price 1998, Haspelmath 2001, Heine/Kuteva 2006)

As a general introductory remark we can distinguish between three '''structural types''' of languages: 
* [[isolating language|isolating]] (i.e. grammatical/sentence functions are expressed through analytic means and relatively strict word-order rules, e.g. the strict S-V order rule in English),
* [[agglutinating]] (i.e. grammatical/sentence functions are expressed through [[affix]]es, with one affix expressing exactly one function) and
* [[inflective|inflecting]] (i.e. grammatical/sentence functions are expressed through affixes, with one affix expressing several functions).
European languages are seldom pure representatives of one type. For (a) Modern English is a good example (and in many way the code oral of French verbs); for (c) Old English and Modern High German are good examples (and in many ways the code écrit of French verb forms); classical representatives of type (b) are Finnish and Hungarian. If a language is not isolating, this does not necessarily mean that it has no word-order rules. [[Latin]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and the [[Slavic languages]] have a relatively free [[word order]], whereas many languages show more restricted rules. [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], e.g., show verb-second word-order in main clauses and verb-final order in subordinate [[clause]]s. English has [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]-[[verb]] word-order, which is also preferred by the [[Romanic languages]]. [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] have a basic verb-initial word order.

We can also distinguish between analytic constructions (with free grammatical [[morpheme]]s, i.e. grammatical elements as separate words) and synthetic constructions (with bound grammatical morphemes, i.e. grammatical elements attached to or included in a word), e.g. ''the house '''of''' the man'' vs. ''the man''''s''' house''.

Apart from the points already mentioned, the categories of '''[[grammatical aspect|aspect]]''' (not always easy to separate from the tense system) and gender are noteworthy. Under the category of aspect linguists basically understand the distinction between perfective actions (activity finished, has led to a result; single event) and imperfective actions (activity not yet finished, w/out information on termination; long duration, repetitive). The Slavic languages have a fine and rigid aspect system; in English there’s the distinction between progressive and non-progressive (simple) and a distinction between present perfect and past; in the Romanic languages the imperfect serves to denote background actions.

The most current '''[[grammatical gender|gender]]''' systems in Europe are twofold (masculine vs. feminine, e.g. in the Romanic languages, or uter vs. neuter, e.g. in Swedish and Danish); but there are also languages that are threefold (e.g. Slavic, German) or lack grammatical gender at all (e.g. English, Hungarian, Finnish). The problem of gender also concerns the system of personal [[pronoun]]s. We normally distinguish between three persons singular and three persons plural, but there are also some languages that have specific words for the dual (e.g. [[Slovene language|Slovene]]). In the 3rd person singular we often have a distinction according to grammatical gender; in English, though, the choice is determined by natural gender; in Hungarian and Finnish we have no differentiation at all, in the Scandinavian languages on the other hand we have a differentiation that incorporate both grammatical and natural gender. In some languages the grammatical gender is also relevant in the 3rd pl. (e.g. the Romance languages).

Whereas traditionally we group languages according to historical language families (e.g. [[Indo-European languages]], [[Uralic languages]]), a more modern way is to look at grammatical features from a synchronic point of view. A certain number of common structural features would then characterize a [[sprachbund]]. For Europe, the most prominent sprachbund that we can determine is referred to as SAE (= [[Standard Average European]]) or Charlemagne sprachbund. Haspelmath (2001) illustrates that German, Dutch, [[French language|French]], [[Occitan]] and Northern [[Italian language|Italian]] are the most central members of this sprachbund. Important features are (cf., e.g., Haspelmath 2001, Heine/Kuteva 2006): 
# the distinction between an indefinite and a definite [[article (grammar)|article]]
# the formation of [[relative clause]]s, which are positioned after the (pro)noun concerned and are introduced by a variable [[relative pronoun]]
# a [[past tense]] construction with “to have”
# a [[passive voice]] construction that shows the object of the action in the syntactic position of the subject and that uses the past participle in connection with an auxiliary
# a specific [[suffix]] for the [[comparative]]

===Vocabulary===
(Sources and further information for this section: Haarmann 1975, Haarmann 1993, Paczolay 1997, Panzer 2000, Görlach 2002)

'''Latin, French and English''' not only served or still serve as [[lingua franca|''linguae francae'']] (cf. below), but also influenced the vernacular/national languages due to their high prestige. Due to this prestige, there are not only “necessity loans”, but also “luxury loans” and pseudo-loans. Many loans from these three languages (esp. Neo-Latin with its Greek elements) can be considered [[internationalism (linguistics)|internationalisms]], although occasionally the meanings vary from one language to another, which might even lead to misunderstandings. Examples: 
* Lat. ''forma'': e.g. Fr. ''forme'', It. Sp. Cat. Cz. Slovak. Serbian. Slovene Maltese Hung. Pol. Croat. Latv. Lith. ''forma'', Dan. Swed. E. Du. ''vorm'' (shape) and ''form'' (aerobic endurance), Romansh ''furma'', G. ''Form'', Ir. ''foirm''
* Fr. ''restaurant'', e.g. E. Du. Norw. Cat. Romansh ''restaurant'', G. ''Restaurant'', Swed. ''restaurang'', Pg. ''restaurante'', Sp. ''restaurante'', It. ''ristorante'', Cz. ''restaurace'', Slovak ''reštaurácia'', Slovene ''restavracija'', Latv. ''restorâns'', Lith. ''restoranas'', Estn. ''restoran'', Pol. ''restauracja'', Serbian ''restoran'', Maltese ''ristorant''/''restorant''
* E. ''manager'', e.g. Du. Norw. Swed. Icel. Fr. Sp. Cat. It. Finn. Romansh ''manager'', G. ''Manager'', Pol. ''menadżer'', Serb. ''menadžer'', Croat. ''menedžer'', Lith. ''menedžeris'', Hung. ''menedzser'', Maltese ''maniġer''

Three minor source languages for European borrowings are [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (esp. in mathematics and science, foreign plants and fruits), Italian (esp. in arts, esp. from the 15th to the 17th centuries), German (esp. in arts, education, mining, trading from the 12th to the 20th centuries with alternating importance).

As far as the structuring or “wording” of the world is concerned changes occur relatively fast due to progresses in knowledge, sociopolitical changes etc. Lexical items that seem more conservative are proverbs and [[metaphor]]ical idioms. Many European proverbs and idioms go back to Antiquity and the Bible, some originate in national stories and were spread over other languages via Latin. A typical European proverb to express that there is no profit without working can be paraphrased as “Roasted pigeons/larks/sparrows/geese/chickens/birds don’t fly into one’s mouth”, e.g.  Cz. ''Pečeni ptáci nelítají do huby (birds!)'' = Dan. ''Stegte duer flyve ingen i munden (pigeon!)'' = ndl. ''De gebraden duiven vliegen je niet in de mond (pigeons!)'' = E. ''He thinks that larks will fall into his mouth roasted'' = Finn. ''Ei paistetut varpuset suuhun lennä (sparrows!)'' = Fr. ''Les alouettes ne vous tombent pas toutes rôties dans le bec (larks!)'' = G. ''Gebratene Tauben fliegen einem nicht ins Maul (pigeon!)'' = Hungar. ''Senkinek nem repül a szájába a sült galamb (pigeon!)'' = Lith. ''Keptas karvelis neatlėks pats i burną (pigeon!)'' = Latv. ''Cepts zvirbulis no jumta mutē nekrīt (sparrow!)'' = ([[Nynorsk]]) Norw. ''Det kjem ikkje steikte fuglar fljugande i munnen (bird!)'' = Pol. ''Pieczone gołąbki nie przydą same do gąbki (pigeons!)'' = Slovak ''Nech nik nečaká, že mu pečené holuby budú padať do úst (pigeons!)'' = Slovene ''Pečeni golobje ne lete nobenemu v usta [pigeons!] = Swed. Stekta sparvar flyger inte in i munnen (sparrows!)''.

===Communicative strategies===
(Sources and further information for this section: Axtell 1993, Collett 1993, Morrison et al. 1994, Hickey/Stewart 2005, Grzega 2006)

In [[Geert Hofstede]]’s terms Europe can, to a large extent, be considered an '''individualistic''' civilization (i.e. a rather direct and analytic style is preferred, important points are mentioned before an explanation or illustration in an argument, decisions are based on compromise or the majority’s vote); in contrast, the Sinic (Chinese), Japanese, Arabic and Hindu (Indian) civilizations are collectivistic (i.e. a rather indirect and synthetic style is used, explanations and illustrations are mentioned before the essential point of an argument, decisions are reached through consent). We can further make [[Edward Hall]]’s distinction between “low context” communication (i.e. direct style, person-oriented, self-projection, loquacity) and “high context” communication (i.e. indirect style, status-oriented, reservation, silence). Most European nations use '''“low context” communication'''.

What are some specific features of European communication strategies? 
# One of them is the mostly reciprocal use of '''address terms''' (this is different in Slavic and Asian civilizations, for totally different reasons). Status seems to play a less important role than in the Sinic, Korean, and Japanese civilizations. Communication between the sexes is absolutely normal in Europe, whereas it is traditionally very rare in the Arabic civilization. As to pronouns, we can point out the pronominal dualism in the vast majority of European languages: Romance, such as French, or Spanish (which also exists in Argentina, Uruguay, Guatemala [''vos'' vs. ''usted''], German, Slavic languages [e.g. Russ. ''ty'' vs. ''vy'']; it has also been said that the American dialect form ''y'all'' is/was occasionally used as a formal address pronoun—cf. [[y'all]]). There are also tendencies in the nominal series of address terms, which distinguish Europe from other civilizations. In private, Europeans nowadays agree on addressing each other by the first name comparatively fast; in business communication, one should first use the correct title, even if a change toward less formal addressing may occur quite rapidly again. Titles are definitely more important in the Hindu, Arabic, Sinic and Japanese civilizations; the Slavic civilization can be characterized particularly by the frequency of nicknames in all kinds of private and informal conversation. This is especially valid of Slavic Orthodox countries, such as Russia. Nicknames are sometimes also used in informal and social situations among close friends and associates in the Americas (North and South/Latin), but to a somewhat lesser extent.
# Concerning '''salutation terms''' in Europe (cf. especially Spillner 2001) we find that many of them include wishes for a good time of the day, for health (or the question whether somebody is in good health), for success or for luck. The common Arabic and Asiatic wish for peace, though, is rare in European civilization; the exception being the ecclesiastical Latin ''Pax tecum/vobiscum''. It is also noteworthy that many European salutation phrases are frequently (at least in informal situations) very much reduced on a phonetic level, which is not so much the case in Arabic, Hindu (Indian), Sinic (Chinese) and Japanese civilizations.
# Frequent '''small talk''' topics are traveling, soccer (and other international sports disciplines), hobbies, the entertainment industry and the weather. In contrast, sexuality, death, religion, politics, money or class, personal issues and swearing are generally tabooed. Any racial, ethnic, sexist and cultural biased comments are shunned and morally opposed in Europe (and all developed countries) more than anywhere else. In Hindu, Arabic, Sinic and Japanese civilization people are frequently asked about their family (in Arabic civilization, however, this excludes the wife...even the word "wife" is compared to the "F" word in English-speaking countries). Due to their status-oriented nature, people from the Far East civilizations often ask for “administrative form” information, especially in Japan.
# Among Europeans (includes the Americas and Australia) and sometimes east Asians (esp. in Japan), the phrases for '''“thank you”''' are expected and welcomed in quite a number of situations (it's said the most in Great Britain and North America), whereas South Asian and Middle Eastern people use the phrase in a more economical way and often contend themselves with simple looks of thanks; on the other hand, other non-western civilizations (i.e. Polynesians of the south Pacific and Native American tribes) have rather extended formulae of thanks.
# With '''requests''' (cf. especially Trosborg 1995 and Cenoz/Valencia 1996), the bare imperative is normally avoided in favor of devices such as questions, modal auxiliaries, subjunctive, conditional, special adverbs. The exchange of verbal stems, which is found in Japanese and Sinic languages, is not a part of (Indo-)European languages.
# When somebody has to '''say no''', this is normally accompanied by some form of apology or explanation. In the civilizations of the Far East and many Native American tribes in North America, the formal equivalents for “no” are unaccepted and/or basically tabooed in general.
# '''Apologies''' are necessary with face-threatening acts or after somebody has intruded somebody else’s private sphere—which is bigger and thus more easily violated in North America and Asia than in Europe and bigger in Europe (esp. the British Isles for etiquette reasons) than in Latin America and the Arab nations, and the concept of privacy and apology is universal, but varies from northern/western, eastern/Slavic and southern/Mediterranean countries. (Cf. especially Trosborg 1995).
# If the national descriptions by Axtell (1998) and Morris et al. (1979) are compared, then the following conclusions can be drawn with regard to '''compliments''': in Europe one can safely make compliments on somebody’s clothes and appearance, meals and restaurants, voluntary offerings, a room’s equipment.

==Linguae Francae==
(Sources and further information for this section: Haarmann 1975, Haarmann 1993, Grzega 2006)

Europe’s history is characterized by three [[lingua franca|linguae francae]]:
* (Medieval and Neo-) '''[[Latin]]'''  with a gradual decline as lingua franca since the late [[Middle Ages]], when the [[vernacular]] languages gained more and more importance (first language academy in Italy in 1582/83), in the 17th century even at universities) apart from the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]).
* '''[[French Language|French]]''' (from the times of [[Cardinal Richelieu]] and [[Louis XIV]], c. 1648 (i.e. after the [[Thirty Years' War]], which had hardly affected [[France]], thus free to prosper), till the end of [[World War I]], c. 1918)European languages
* '''[[English Language|English]]'''

Linguae francae that were less widespread, but still played a comparatively important role in European history are:
* [[Occitan language|Provençal]] ([[Occitan]]) (12th to 14th centuries, due to the [[troubadour]] poetry)
* [[Middle Low German]] (14th to 16th centuries, during the heyday of the [[Hanseatic League]], particularly in [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and Northeastern Europe.)
* [[Russian language|Russian]] (19th and 20th centuries, in eastern and central Europe as a result of domination by the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Soviet Union]])

The first type of [[dictionary|dictionaries]] are [[glossary|glossaries]], i.e. more or less structured lists of lexical pairs (in alphabetical order or according to conceptual fields). The Latin-German (Latin-Bavarian) Abrogans is among the first. A new wave of [[lexicography]] can be seen from the late 15th century onwards (after the introduction of the [[printing press]], with the growing interest for standardizing languages).

In the Middle Ages the two most important definitory elements of Europe were ''Christianitas'' and ''Latinitas''. Thus language—at least the supranational language—played an elementary role. This changed with the spread of the national languages in official contexts and the rise of a national feeling. Among other things, this led to projects of standardizing national language and gave birth to a number of language academies (e.g. 1582 [[Accademia della Crusca]] in Florence, 1617 Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft, 1635 [[Académie française]], 1713 [[Real Academia Española|Real Academia de la Lengua]] in Madrid). “Language” was then (and still is today) more connected with “nation” than with “civilization” (particularly in France). “Language” was also used to create a feeling of “religious/ethnic identity” (e.g. different [[Bible]] translations by Catholics and Protestants of the same language).

Among the first standardization discussions and processes are the ones for Italian (“questione della lingua”: Modern Tuscan/Florentine vs. Old Tuscan/Florentine vs. Venetian &gt; Modern Florentine + archaic Tuscan + Upper Italian), French (standard is based on Parisian), English (standard is based on the [[London]] dialect) and (High) German (based on: [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancellery]] of Meißen/Saxony + Middle German + chancellery of [[Prague]]/Bohemia [“Common German”]). But also a number of other nations began to look for and develop a standard variety in the 16th century.

==Linguistic minorities==
(Sources and further information for this section: Stephens 1976, Price 1998, Ahrens 2003, Grzega 2006)

Despite the importance of English as an international lingua franca also in Europe, Europe can be associated with its linguistic diversity, which also includes the special protection of minority languages, e.g. by the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] founded in the 1990s. This underlines that the popular view of “one nation = one language” (cf. Wirrer 2003) is mostly false.

A minority language can be defined as a language used by a group that defines itself as an ethnic minority group, whereby the language of this group is typologically different and not a dialect of the standard language. For several years now, Jan Wirrer has been working on the status of minority languages in Europe (cf., e.g., Wirrer 2000 and 2003). In Europe—e.g. thanks to the European Charter of Regional and Minority Language—some languages are in quite a strong position, in the sense that they are given special status, such as Basque, Irish, Welsh/Cymraeg, Catalan, Rhaeto-Romance/Romansh and Romani, native language of the [[Romani people|Roma]]/Gypsies in southern Europe), whereas others are in a rather weak position (e.g. Frisian, Scottish Gaelic, Turkish, Saami/Lappish, Sorbian/Wendish and Yiddish, the once common language of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in Eastern Europe). Especially [[allochthonous]] minority languages are not given official status in the EU.

Some minor languages don’t even have a standard yet, i.e. they have not even reached the level of an [[ausbausprache]] yet, which could be changed, e.g., if these languages were given official status. (cf. also next section).

==Issues in language politics==
(Sources and further information for this section: Siguan 2002, Ahrens 2003, Grzega 2006)

France is the origin of two laws, or decrees, concerning language: the Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts (1239), which says that every document in France should be written in French (i.e. not in Latin nor Occitan) and the French [[Loi Toubon]], which aims at eliminating Anglicisms from official documents. But a characteristic feature of Europe is linguistic diversity and tolerance, which is not only shown by the European Charta of Regional and Minority Languages. An illustrative proof of the promotion of linguistic diversity in the Middle Ages is the translation school in [[Toledo, Spain]], founded in the 12th century (in medieval Toledo the Christian, the Jewish and the Arab civilizations lived together remarkably peacefully).

This tolerant linguistic attitude is also the reason why the EU’s general rule is that every official national language is also an official EU language. However, Letzebuergish/[[Luxemburgish]] is not an official EU language, because there are also other (stronger) official languages with “EU status” in that country. Several concepts for an EU language policy are being debated: 
* one official language (e.g. English, [[Interlingua]], or [[Esperanto]]).
* several official languages (e.g. English, French, German, Spanish + another topic-dependent language).
* all national languages as official languages, but with a number of relais languages for translations (e.g. English or Esperanto as relais languages).
* New immigrants in European countries are expected to learn the host nation's language, but are still speaking and reading their native languages (i.e. Arabic, Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Swahili and Tahitian) in Europe's increasingly multi-ethnic/multicultural profile.

'''Gaspar Frutuoso''' (c.1522 in [[Ponta Delgada]] – 1591 in [[Ribeira Grande, São Miguel|Ribeira Grande]]) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[priest]], [[historian]] and [[Humanism|humanist]] from the island of [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]], in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] archipelago of the [[Azores]]. His major contribution to [[Portuguese history]] was his detailed descriptions of the [[history]] and [[geography]] of the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], [[Canary Islands]] and references to [[Colonial Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], which he published in his six-part tome ''[[Gaspar Frutuoso#Saudades da Terra|Saudades da Terra]]'', as well as ''Saudades do Céu''. He is normally cited in settlement history of the islands of the [[Azores]].

==Biography==
Gaspar Frutuoso was born in 1522,&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigo Rodrigues (1991), p.109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Luz 1996, p.475"&gt;José Luís Brandão da Luz (1996), p. 475&lt;/ref&gt; on the island of [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]], son of Frutuoso Dias, a merchant and rural property-owner, and his wife Isabel Fernandes. Little is known of his childhood, apart from references to him working his father's lands during this period.

The first trustworthy record about Frutuoso was his admission to the [[University of Salamanca]] (in 1548) where he later obtained an [[Art]]s certification.&lt;ref name="Luz 1996, p.475"/&gt; At the age of 31 (in 1554), he was ordained during a visit to [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]];&lt;ref name="Luz 1996, p.475"/&gt; his records from 1554 to 1555 show him registered as ''presbitero bachiller''.  He continued his studies in [[Salamanca]] under the noted theologian [[Domingo de Soto]], the royal confessor of King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (and Charles I of Spain)]] and envoy to the [[Council of Trent]], where he obtained a theology baccalaureate.&lt;ref name="Luz 1996, p.475"/&gt; During his time in Salamanca he became friends with Father Miguel Torres, a member of the [[Society of Jesus]], which would later serve him as he was promoting charitable activities in the Azores.

He briefly returned to the Azores between 1558 and 1560, where he became [[parish]] priest in [[Santa Cruz (Lagoa)|Santa Cruz]], in the municipality of [[Lagoa (Azores)|Lagoa]] (records written by him during this period date his time in the parish).

In 1560, he decided to return to Salamanca in order to complete a [[Doctorate]] in Theology, but began working with [[Bishop]] Julião de Alva in [[Bragança Municipality|Bragança]], where he remained until 1563. It is unclear when, and from where, he attained his [[Doctorate]], but he began to use this title from 1565, also when his name began appearing on the [[University of Évora]]'s registry (an institution of the [[Society of Jesus]]), after 1569.&lt;ref name="Luz 1996, p.476"&gt;José Luís Brandão da Luz, 1996, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;

By decree, 20 May 1565, he was nominated to be the [[vicar]] and orator at the parochial Church of ''Nossa Senhora da Estrela'' (''Our Lady of the Star''), in the municipality of [[Ribeira Grande, São Miguel|Ribeira Grande]], a position he held for the next 26 years (until his death). During this time, he was dedicated to the parish, as well as charitable works he contributed towards on and off-island, but still had time writing his 16 manuscripts that included '''''Saudades da Terra''''', and '''''Saudades do Ceu'''''.&lt;ref name="Luz 1996, p.476"/&gt;

Ever mindful of the politics of the time, during the period of the [[Philippine Dynasty]], he was:
:''"...generally benevolent, and at the same time cautious and prudent...always respecting the established order, he always spoke of [[Phillip II of Spain|Phillip II]] with reverence owed to his royal majesty and mindful of his right to the throne, never letting himself fall into diatribes or acerbic references nor acrimony against contrary factions."''&lt;ref&gt;M.O. Carvalho (O Açoreano, Vol.3 No.10), pp. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1566, during the French assault on [[Funchal]], he collected funds and wheat for the people of [[Madeira]].

He died on 24 August 1591 and was buried in the Church of Nossa Senhora da Estrela, in Ribeira Grande.

==Saudades da Terra==

[[File:Saudades da Terra, Gaspar Frutuoso, 1590.jpg|thumb|170px|Second volume of Frutuoso's ''Saudades da Terra'', dedicated to Madeira]]

'''''Saudades da Terra''''', literally ''Nostalgic-longing for the Land'', is a six-volume tome that contains observations by the author, of the history and geography of the Atlantic territories of the Kingdom of Portugal, as well as the [[Canary Islands]] (lands at one time attributed to Portugal). It is a referential work for the understanding of the islands of [[Macaronesia]] at the end of the 16th Century. The work is not limited to [[geography]] and [[history]], but also covers daily life, customs and traditions, [[genealogy]], the origins of place names, [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and affirms Frutuoso's humanist nature, typical of the [[Renaissance]]. The author is an encyclopedic, literary and artistic observer of the natural phenomenons, preoccupied with experimental [[alchemy]] and speculative on aspects of [[geology]], [[biology]], [[mineralogy]] and [[petrology]].

His detailed descriptions are so detailed that they were published into separate volumes which cover:
* Book I - [[Colonial Cape Verde|Cape Verde]] and [[Canary Islands]];
* Book [http://en.calameo.com/read/000019422a4217768904a|Book II – Madeira];
* Book III - [[Santa Maria Island (Azores)|Santa Maria]] ([[Azores]]);
* Book IV - [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]] (Azores);
* Book V - Poem
* Book VI - [[Terceira]], [[Faial Island|Faial]], [[Pico Island|Pico]], [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]], [[Graciosa]], [[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]] (Azores).

The fifth volume is an elaborate poem, from the perspective of a fictional character, writing in a pastoral style, about the [[history]] of two friends that are separated and forced to live far from home. Some biographers have cited this as a deliberate [[autobiography]] of Frutuoso and his University friend, the [[São Miguel Island|Micalense]] medic, Gaspar Gonçalves.

Gaspar Frutuoso apparently attempted to publish his work, going so far as to rework and edit his manuscript (the original has many edits in his hand). For reasons that are never clear, although the Spanish occupation of the island (during the [[Iberian Union]]) may have influenced his decision, he never published the work. The manuscript, along with documents from his library, were sent to the [[Church of the Jesuit College (Ponta Delgada)|Jesuit College]] in [[Ponta Delgada]] and preserved until 1760 (when the [[Society of Jesus]] was expelled from Portugal). The manuscript fell into the hands of people who restricted access to the document, until it was donated to the General Committee of [[Ponta Delgada]], and incorporated into the holdings of the Public Library and Archive (where it now resides). The work was finally published in 1873, with thirty notes by Álvaro Rodrigues de Azevedo, and a prologue by the ''Dicionário Universal de Português Ilustrado'' (''Illustrated Universal Dictionary of Portugal''), written by Fernandes Costa. Many partial editions of ''Saudades da Terra'' have been re-published by the ''Instituto Cultural de Ponta Delgada'' since 1966.

'''Giuseppe Pecci''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Society of Jesus|S.J.]]}} (13 December 1807 &amp;ndash; 8 February 1890) was a Jesuit [[Thomist]] theologian whose younger brother, Vincenzo, became [[Pope Leo XIII]] and appointed him a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]. The [[Thomism|Neo-Thomist]] revival, which Leo XIII and his brother Giuseppe, Cardinal Pecci originated in 1879, remained the leading papal philosophy until [[Vatican II]].

Born in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, Giuseppe was one of the seven sons of Count Dominico Ludovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi Buzi, Countess Pecci. From 1807 to 1818 he lived at home with his family. Together with his younger brother Vincenzo, he studied in the [[Jesuit]] College in [[Viterbo]] from 1818 until 1824.&lt;ref&gt;Kühne 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;peter-hug.ch/lexikon/18_0714&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824, Count Pecci called him and Vincenzo home to Rome, where their mother was dying;  the father wanted his children to be with him after the loss of his wife, and so they remained in Rome, attending the [[Collegium Romanum]], a college belonging to the [[Jesuits|Society of Jesus]].
In 1828, the question of occupational choice arose for the two brothers; Giuseppe Pecci professed the Jesuit order, while Vincenzo decided in favour of a diocesan priest.&lt;ref&gt;Kühne 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professor==

Pecci taught [[Thomism]], the theology and philosophy of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in 1847. At the request of his brother, who became Archbishop of Perugia, he was made a professor at the theological seminary in [[Perugia]], where he remained from 1852 through 1859. After the city was taken over by [[Piedmont]] forces in 1860, [[Pope Pius IX]] called him to Rome and offered him a professorship in theology at [[La Sapienza University]]. Pope Pius also called him into the papal commission to prepare the [[First Vatican Council]]. Good ''Thomist theology'' was hard to come by at that time, with the result that young scholars from other countries were sent to Rome to learn from Pecci and [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.die-tagespost.de/Archiv/titel_anzeige.asp?ID=4748&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870 he resigned his professorship because he refused to take the anti-papal oath which was demanded by the new Italian government. He continued his prominent theological research independently.

For the most part throughout his life, he refused to be photographed: he considered painting a 'far superior and more benevolent presentation of a human being'.&lt;ref&gt;Benno Kühne, Papst Leo XIII Unser Heiliger Vater in seinem Leben und wirken, Benzinger, Einsiedeln, 1880&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Coat of arms of Giuseppe Pecci (1807-1890).svg|thumbnail|Coat of arms of Giuseppe Pecci]]
In 1879, the [[College of Cardinals]], led by [[Camillo di Pietro|Camillo, Cardinal di Pietro]], insistently asked [[Pope Leo XIII]] to elevate his brother to their ranks,&lt;ref name="Kühne, 247"&gt;Kühne, 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidlin, Papstgeschichte der Neuesten Zeit, Pustet München 1934, 537&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acta Leonis XIII PM Romae, 1881, Acta I, 35 ff&lt;/ref&gt; and at the age of 71 Giuseppe Pecci was created [[Cardinal-Deacon]] of ''[[Sant'Agata dei Goti]]'' on 12 May 1879 in his brother's first [[Papal consistory|consistory]]. He was the last member of a Pope's family elevated to the cardinalate.

The ceremony was described by [[Ludwig von Pastor]] in his diary:  On 15 May at 11&amp;nbsp;am, Pope Leo XIII entered the hall in pontifical vestments, before him the [[College of Cardinals]]. The [[Swiss Guards]] stood to attention. After the Papal speech, each of the new cardinals, Pecci, [[John Henry Newman]], [[Joseph Hergenröther]] and [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], received the red hat, all of whom being well-known Church scholars.&lt;ref&gt;L. von Pastor, Tagebücher, Heidelberg, 1950 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thomism==
[[File:Leoborn.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Carpineto in 1860]]

The elevation of Pecci, a well-known Thomist, took place in the context of the determined efforts of [[Leo XIII]] to foster science and Thomist theology throughout the Catholic Church [http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1879.htm#Pecci]. Thomism had lost its role as a leading theology and Leo attempted to re-establish it "for the protection of faith, welfare of society and the advancement of science".&lt;ref&gt;Schmidlin 394&lt;/ref&gt; What he envisaged were not sterile interpretations of it, but a return to the original sources. This new orientation at the beginning of his pontificate was welcomed by Dominicans, Thomist Jesuits like Pecci and numerous bishops throughout the world. Strong opposition also developed as well on several fronts within the Church:  Some considered Thomism simply outdated, while others used it for petty condemnations of dissident views that they did not like.&lt;ref name="Schmidlin 395"&gt;Schmidlin 395&lt;/ref&gt; As traditional antagonists, Jesuits and Dominicans both claimed leadership in the renewal of Catholic theology.&lt;ref name="Schmidlin 395"/&gt;
[[File:Leobirth.jpg|160px |thumb|left|The house in Carpineto, in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]

===Papal Collaboration===
[[File:Kardinal Giuseppe Pecci JS.jpg|200px|thumb|Photo of Cardinal Pecci in 1887]]
Pope Leo responded with the encyclical ''[[Æterni Patris]]'', much of which was co-written by Cardinal Pecci [http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1879.htm#Pecci] on the restoration of Christian philosophy in the schools, which was published on 4 August 1879, and mandated all Catholic universities to teach Thomism; it also created a papal academy for the training of Thomist professors and publishing scholarly editions of the works of [[St Thomas Aquinas]]. The leadership of this academy he entrusted to his brother, who aided the creation of similar Thomas Aquinas academies in other places (Bologna, Freiburg (Switzerland), Paris and Lowden). In 1879, Cardinal Pecci was appointed as first [[Prefect]] of the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]], which Leo founded on 15 October 1879, and was also appointed Prefect of the [[Congregation for Catholic Education|Congregation for Studies]] in February 1884 [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bpec.html]. (On 28 January 1999, the academy was reoriented to more social issues by [[Pope John Paul II]].)&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontificio 2005, p.1908&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Leo XIII appointed thirty members, ten each from Rome, from Italy, and from the rest of the world, and provided generous financial support to attract scholars from everywhere. The Pope also personally supported individual Thomist scholars and applauded numerous critical editions of the ''Angelic Doctor'''s texts.&lt;ref name="Schmidlin 395"/&gt; To balance his Thomist Jesuit appointments, Leo entrusted the overall responsibility of the works of St Thomas Aquinas to the [[Dominican Order]], of which the saint had been a member.

===Vatican Library===
Pope Leo XIII considered the mostly locked-up and neglected [[Vatican Library]] as "''an infinite treasure for the Church and a monument to its role in culture and science''".&lt;ref&gt;Schmidlin 400&lt;/ref&gt; He greatly increased staff and organization and appointed Jesuit father [[Franz Ehrle]] and Giuseppe Pecci to head the new undertaking as [[prefect]] and librarian, respectively. They in turn opened the Vatican Library to the general public after establishing a consultation library of 300,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidlin 401&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Cardinal Pecci continued his work as congregation and academy prefect and librarian until he died on 8 February 1890, of complications from pneumonia. His body [[lying in repose|lay in repose]] in the Basilica of the Twelve Apostles ([[Basilica dei Santi Apostoli]]) in Rome, where his funeral took place on 12 February. He is buried in the chapel of the Society of Jesus in [[Campo Verano]] Cemetery, in Rome [http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1879.htm#Pecci][http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSsr=41&amp;GScid=2227945&amp;GRid=32915216&amp;].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5790">'''Gutierre Tibón''' (16 July 1905 – 15 May 1999&lt;ref&gt;http://descargas.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/scclng/12926185627847162987435/030750.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) was an Italian-Mexican author. He wrote widely on issues of cultural identity, mixing ideas from anthropology, linguistics, psychology, philosophy, ethnology, sociology, and political science.

==Early career==
Tibón was born in [[Lombardy]], [[Italy]]. In his early years he worked as a typewriter salesman, later travelling widely in Europe and the Americas for his work.&lt;ref name = "lou"&gt;Louis Nesbit, "Gutierre Tibón: Prophet in Mexico", ''Hispania,'' Vol. 33, No. 1, Feb., 1950, pp. 51-53&lt;/ref&gt; His visits to Mexico attracted him to the country, and he moved there in 1940. He established himself as a writer and radio personality. His first major work was on the culture and future prospects of Mexico. ''México, 1950, Un País en Futuro'' (1942) looked forward to what he called a ''México Feliz'', which he thought could be achieved by 1950. He advocated strong leadership and government intervention to promote mass education.&lt;ref name = "lou"/&gt; He later had a success with ''Viaje à la India por el Aire'', which originated as broadcast conversations with the poet [[Ricardo López Méndez]] about his travels in the Middle East on the way to India. Tibón's ability to mix anecdotes, philosophical observations and political commentary on the culture of the countries he passed through proved popular.&lt;ref name = "lou"/&gt; He was awarded an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] by the [[Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo]] on 11 October 1946 for his writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivohistorico.umich.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=38 university homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Onomastics==
Tibón has been especially interested in the history of [[personal name|personal]] and [[toponym|topographical]] names. His book ''América: Setenta siglos de la historia de un nombre'' (1945) constitutes what has been called a "novelized study in which a word is the chief character".&lt;ref name = "lou"/&gt; He argues that the [[America (name)|name "America"]] is "a masterpiece of chance", and proceeds to trace its etymology from the personal name of [[Amerigo Vespucci]] to its Germanic original [[Spanish language|Amalric]] and to ancient roots, which he claims to link to the meaning "land of industrious and powerful men".&lt;ref name = "lou"/&gt; In ''Origen, Vida y Milagros de su Apellido'', he extended this method to the discussion of personal names, providing elaborate historical genealogies and anecdotes to create a narrative of humanity though names. He was most interested in Spanish and [[Sephardic Jew]]ish names.&lt;ref name = "lou"/&gt;

In 1946 the [[Academia Mexicana de Genealogía y Heráldica]] elected him as a Numbered Academician&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lajornadamorelos.com/opinion/articulos/72540?task=view |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219215851/http://lajornadamorelos.com/opinion/articulos/72540?task=view |archivedate=2009-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later work==
His later writings continue his interest in names, but also branch out to include mysticist or occult topics. He developed the method of his book on America in his discussion of the origins of Mexico in ''Historia del nombre y de la fundación de México '' (1975).

In ''El Ombligo como centro cósmico'' (1981), he argued for the survivals of "paleolithic magic" in a "prenatal triad" of umbilical cord, placenta and amniotic sac and on the navel as "cosmic center". In ''Los Ritos Mágicos y Trágicos de la Pubertad Femenina'' (1984) he explored the "magic and tragic rites" of female puberty.

He was elected to the [[Academia Mexicana de la Lengua]] as an honorary member on 10 December 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centenarios.org.mx/1900autores.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibón died in [[Cuernavaca]], [[Morelos]] in 1999.

The [[history of Bolivia]] since 1982 begins with the restorations of democracy after the rule of the [[Junta of Commanders of the Armed Forces 1982 (Bolivia)|military junta of 1982]]. [[Evo Morales]] has held the [[President of Bolivia|presidency]] since 2006. A [[Constitution of Bolivia|new constitution]] was enacted in 2009. [[Demographics of Bolivia|Bolivia's population]] has roughly doubled over this period, from 5 million in 1980 to 10 million as of 2012. 

==Hernán Siles Zuaso (1982–85)==
The former president [[Hernán Siles Zuazo]] assumed the presidency of Bolivia on 10 October 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.opinion.com.bo/opinion/articulos/2012/1010/noticias.php?id=74046 | title=Siles Zuazo Inicia una Nueva Etapa |trans-title=Siles Starts a New Stage | language=Spanish | archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:edTcO5_SLrUJ:www.opinion.com.bo/opinion/articulos/2012/1010/noticias.php%3Fid%3D74046+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us | archivedate=8 February 2014 | newspaper=[[La Opinion]] | date=10 October 2010 | accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a general strike that brought the country close to civil war. Severe social tension, exacerbated by economic mismanagement and weak leadership, forced Siles Zuaso to call early elections and relinquish power a year before the end of his constitutional term.{{CN|date=February 2014}}

== Víctor Paz Estenssoro (1985–1989)==
In the [[Bolivian general election, 1985|1985 elections]], the [[Nationalist Democratic Action]] (ADN) of General [[Hugo Banzer Suárez]] won a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular vote, followed by former President [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]]'s [[Nationalist Revolutionary Movement]] (MNR) and former Vice President [[Jaime Paz Zamora]]'s [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Bolivia)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] (MIR). But in the congressional run-off, the MIR sided with the MNR, and Paz Estenssoro was chosen for a fourth term as President. When he took office in 1985, he faced a staggering economic crisis. Economic output and exports had been declining for several years.{{CN|date=February 2014}}

[[Hyperinflation]] had reached an annual rate of 24%. Social unrest, chronic strikes, and unchecked [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] were widespread. In 4 years Paz Estenssoro's administration achieved economic and social stability. The military stayed out of politics, and all major political parties publicly and institutionally committed themselves to democracy. Human rights violations, which badly tainted some governments earlier in the decade, were no longer a problem. However, his remarkable accomplishments were not won without sacrifice. The collapse of [[tin]] prices in October 1985, coming just as the government was moving to reassert its control of the mismanaged state mining enterprise, forced the government to lay off over 20,000 miners.{{CN|date=February 2014}}

Under pressure from the United States to control [[coca]] production, Bolivia passed Law 1008 to enable eradication. Protests by [[cocalero|coca growers]] in [[Chapare Province|Chapare]] against the proposed law were met by the [[Villa Tunari massacre]] in which 12 farmers were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Evo rinde homenaje a mártires de la masacre de Villa Tunari | work = Cambio | accessdate = 2010-11-30 | date = 2009-06-16 | url = http://www.cambio.bo/noticia.php?fecha=2009-06-16&amp;idn=1645 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jaime Paz Zamora (1989-1993)==
Although the MNR list headed by [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] finished first in the 1989 elections, no candidate received a majority of popular vote and in accordance with the constitution, a congressional vote determined who would be president. The [[Patriotic Accord]] (AP) coalition between Gen. Banzer's ADN and Jaime Paz Zamora's MIR, the second- and third-place finishers, respectively, won. Paz Zamora assumed the presidency, and the MIR took half the ministries. Banzer's center-right ADN took control of the [[National Political Council]] (CONAP) and the other ministries.

Paz Zamora was a moderate, center-left President whose political pragmatism in office outweighed his [[Marxist]] origins. Having seen the destructive hyperinflation of the Siles Zuazo administration, he continued the [[neoliberal]] economic reforms begun by Paz Estenssoro, codifying some of them. Paz Zamora took a fairly hard line against domestic terrorism, personally ordering the December 1990 attack on terrorists of the [[Néstor Paz Zamora Commission]].

Paz Zamora was less decisive against narcotics trafficking. The government broke up a number of trafficking networks but issued a 1991 surrender decree giving lenient sentences to the biggest narcotics kingpins. Also, his administration was extremely reluctant to pursue [[coca eradication]]. It did not agree to an updated [[extradition]] treaty with the US, although two traffickers have been extradited to the U.S. since 1992. Beginning in early 1994, the Bolivian Congress investigated Paz Zamora's personal ties to accused major trafficker [[Isaac Chavarria]], who subsequently died in prison while awaiting trial. MIR deputy chief [[Oscar Eid]] was jailed in connection with similar ties in 1994; he was found guilty and sentenced to 4 years in prison in November 1996. Technically still under investigation, Paz Zamora became an active presidential candidate in 1996.

==Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada (1993-1997)==
[[File:Gonzálo Sánchez de Lozada-Agencia BrasilAntonio Cruz.jpg|[[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]]|thumb|right|upright]]
The 1993 elections continued the tradition of open, honest elections and peaceful democratic transitions of power. The MNR defeated the ADN/MIR coalition by a 36% to 20% margin, and the MNR's Sánchez de Lozada was selected as president by a Congressional coalition of the MNR, [[Free Bolivia Movement]] (''Movimiento Bolivia Libre'', MBL), and [[Civic Solidarity Union]] (''Unidad Cívica Solidaridad'', UCS).

Sánchez de Lozada pursued an aggressive economic and social reform agenda. The most dramatic change undertaken by the Sanchez de Lozada government was the capitalization program, under which investors acquired 50% ownership and management control of public enterprises, such as the ''[[Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos]]'' (YPFB) oil corporation, telecommunications system, electric utilities, and others. The reforms and economic restructuring were strongly opposed by certain segments of society, which instigated frequent social disturbances, particularly in [[La Paz]] and the [[Chapare Province|Chapare]] coca-growing region, from 1994 through 1996.

== Hugo Banzer Suárez (1997-2001)==
In the 1997 elections, Gen. [[Hugo Banzer]], leader of the ADN, won 22% of the vote, while the MNR candidate won 18%. Gen. Banzer formed a coalition of the ADN, MIR, UCS, and [[Conciencia de Patria]] (CONDEPA) parties which hold a majority of seats in the Bolivian Congress. The Congress elected him as president and he was inaugurated on August 6, 1997.

[[File:Parag.1451.Banzer.jpeg|[[Hugo Banzer]]|thumb|left|upright]]
Between January and April 2000, a [[Cochabamba protests of 2000|series of anti-privatization protests]] took place in [[Cochabamba]] against the [[privatization]] of the municipal water supply that was being pushed through on the recommendation of the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. The Bolivian government declared [[martial law]], killing several people, arresting protest leaders and shutting down radio stations. After continued disturbances and civic pressure, the government finally rolled back the privatization on April 10, 2000.

==Jorge Quiroga Ramírez (2001-2002)==
President Hugo Banzer resigned in August 2001, due to being diagnosed with lung cancer and was succeeded by his vice-president [[Jorge Quiroga]].

== Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada (2002-2003)==
In the 2002 elections, [[Sánchez de Lozada]] ran again, and narrowly beat NFR's [[Manfred Reyes Villa]] and the indigenous leader [[Evo Morales]] of the [[Movement for Socialism – Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples|Movement Toward Socialism]] (MAS) party.

Several days before Bolivians went to the voting booths, the U.S. ambassador [[Manuel Rocha]] warned the Bolivian electorate that if they voted for a candidate known to have links with drug-trafficking, referring indirectly to Morales, the US would cut off foreign aid and close its markets to the country. Because of the public outrage this statement generated, Morales received nearly 21% of the vote, putting him only a couple points behind Sánchez de Lozada.&lt;ref&gt;The Washington Post Hindering Reform In Latin America https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/146365661.html?dids=146365661:146365661&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Aug+6%2C+2002&amp;author=Jeremy+D.+Rosner++And+Mark+Feierstein&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.15&amp;desc=Hindering+Reform+In+Latin+America&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, an increasingly divisive conflict has been the [[Bolivian Gas War]]; a dispute over the exploitation of Bolivia's large [[natural gas]] reserves in the south of the country. Strikes and blockades first erupted in September 2003, with several deaths and dozens of injuries in confrontations with the armed forces. President Sánchez de Lozada resigned under pressure from protesters, formally handing over the presidency to his vice-president, [[Carlos Mesa]], in order to preserve the Constitutional order.

== Carlos Mesa (2003-2005) and Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé (2005-2006)==
[[File:Carlos Mesa.jpg|[[Carlos Mesa]]|thumb|right|upright]]
Mesa was inaugurated and promised to address the demands of the protesting majority. In the face of mounting protests, he resigned on March 7, 2005, claiming he was unable to continue governing the country. With promises of support, he withdrew his resignation.

In May–June 2005, Mesa again tendered his resignation and in a hastily convened session of the Parliament in [[Sucre]], [[Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé]] - the President of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]] - became President on the night of June 9, 2005.  Political agreements were reached to modify the [[Constitution of Bolivia|Constitution]], and allow the full renewal of Parliament, simultaneously with a Presidential Election, on December 4, 2005.

==Evo Morales (2006-present)==
{{main|Presidency of Evo Morales}}
The deterioration of the Bolivian political system contributed towards the rise of a loose confederation of indigenous social movements, the MAS and othe parties, with the head of the MAS Evo Morales, a former ''[[cocalero]]'', as leader. In the [[Bolivian presidential election, 2005|elections of December 2005]] Evo Morales and MAS obtained a comfortable victory reaching 54% of the electorate's votes, becoming the first Native Bolivian president in history.

[[File:Evo Morales.jpg|thumb|[[Evo Morales]]|upright|left]]
In March 2006 Morales announced the increase of the [[minimum wage]] by 50%. However, six Bolivian workers in every ten are part of the [[informal economy]], thus limiting the extent of such a legally mandated increase in wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=En Bolivie, le président Evo Morales promet une hausse de 50% du salaire minimum | publisher=Le Monde | date=March 21, 2006 | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3222,36-753074,0.html|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2006, Evo Morales nationalized most of Bolivia's natural gas fields, which many indigenous Bolivians had demanded for years. Troops were sent in to occupy the gas fields and take back control from foreign companies that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/documents/114824583_BIF%20Bulletin%202.pdf BIF Bulletin No 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Many fields were operated by [[Petrobras]], Brazil's largest energy company, and this political development was expected to strain relations between Morales and leftist Brazilian president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. On October 29, 2006 the Morales government signed agreements with eight foreign gas firms including Petrobras, to give the Bolivian national gas company a majority stake in the gas fields, bringing the nationalization to completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Analysis: Bolivia's gas nationalization | publisher=UPI | date=November 1, 2006 | url=http://www.upi.com/Energy/view.php?StoryID=20061101-125542-9010r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[English language|English]] is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that originated from [[Anglo-Frisian]] dialects brought to [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the mid 5th to 7th centuries AD by [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon settlers]] from what is now northwest [[Germany]], west [[Denmark]] and the [[Netherlands]], [[Celtic language-death in England|displacing the Celtic languages]] that previously predominated.

The [[Old English]] of the Anglo-Saxon era developed into [[Middle English]], which was spoken from the [[Norman Conquest]] era to the late 15th century. A significant influence on the shaping of Middle English came from contact with the [[North Germanic languages]] spoken by the [[Viking invasions of England|Scandinavian]]s who conquered and colonized parts of Britain during the 8th and 9th centuries; this contact led to much lexical borrowing and grammatical simplification. Another important influence came from the conquering Normans, who spoke a [[Romantic languages|Romance]] [[langue d'oïl]] called [[Old Norman]], which in Britain developed into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. Many Norman and French loanwords entered the language in this period, especially in vocabulary related to the church, the court system and the government. The system of [[orthography]] that was established during the Middle English period is largely still in use today – later changes in pronunciation, however, combined with the adoption of various foreign spellings, mean that the [[English orthography|spelling of modern English words]] appears highly irregular.

[[Early Modern English]] – the language used by [[Shakespeare]] – is dated from around 1500. It incorporated many [[Renaissance]]-era loans from [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]], as well as borrowings from other European languages, including French, [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Significant pronunciation changes in this period included the ongoing [[Great Vowel Shift]], which affected the qualities of most [[long vowel]]s. [[Modern English]] proper, similar in most respects to that spoken today, was in place by the late 17th century. The English language came to be exported to other parts of the world through [[British Empire|British colonisation]], and is now the dominant language in Britain and [[Ireland]], the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and many smaller former colonies, as well as being widely spoken in [[India]], parts of [[Africa]], and elsewhere. Partially due to United States influence, English gradually took on the status of a global [[lingua franca]] in the second half of the 20th century. This is especially true in Europe, where English has largely taken over the former roles of French and (much earlier) Latin as a common language used to conduct business and diplomacy, share scientific and technological information, and otherwise communicate across national boundaries. The efforts of English-speaking Christian missionaries has resulted in English becoming a second language for many other groups.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Old English consisted of a diverse group of [[dialect]]s, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] established in different parts of Britain. The [[Late West Saxon]] dialect eventually became dominant; however, a greater input to Middle English came from the [[Anglian dialects]]. Global variation among different [[English dialects]] and [[English accents|accents]] remains significant today. [[Scots language|Scots]], a form of English traditionally spoken in parts of Scotland and the north of Ireland, is sometimes treated as a separate language.

==Proto-English==
{{Main article|Celtic language-death in England}}{{Main article|Saxon shore}}
English has its roots in the languages of the [[Germanic peoples]] of northern Europe. During the [[Roman Empire]], most of the Germanic-inhabited area ([[Germania]]) remained independent from Rome, although some southwestern parts were within the empire. Some Germanics served in the [[Roman military]], and troops from Germanic tribes such as the [[Tungri]], [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]], [[Menapii]] and [[Frisii]] served in Britain ([[Britannia]]) under Roman command. Germanic settlement and power expanded during the [[Migration Period]], which saw the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. The [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Germanic settlement of Britain]] took place from the 5th to the 7th century, following the [[end of Roman rule in Britain|end of Roman rule]] on the island. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' relates that around the year 449 [[Vortigern]], king of the [[Brython|Britons]], invited the "Angle kin" (Angles allegedly led by the Germanic brothers [[Hengist and Horsa]]) to help repel invading [[Picts]], in return for lands in the southeast of Britain. This led to waves of settlers who eventually established seven kingdoms, known as the [[heptarchy]]. (The ''Chronicle'' was not a contemporaneous work, however, and cannot be regarded as an accurate record of such early events.)&lt;ref&gt;Dark, Ken, 2000. ''Britain and the End of the Roman Empire''. Brimscombe, Gloucestershire, Tempus, pp. 43-47.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bede]], who wrote his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]'' in AD 731, writes of invasion by [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]], although the precise nature of the invasion and settlement and the contributions made by these particular groups are the subject of much dispute among historians.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, Stephen, 2006. ''The Origins of the British'' London, Robinson, pp. 364-374.&lt;/ref&gt;

The languages spoken by the Germanic peoples who initially settled in Britain were part of the [[West Germanic]] branch of the [[Germanic language]] family. They consisted of dialects from the [[Ingvaeonic]] grouping, spoken mainly around the [[North Sea]] coast, in regions that lie within modern [[Denmark]], north-west [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Due to specific similarities between early English and [[Old Frisian]], an [[Anglo-Frisian]] grouping is also identified.

These dialects had most of the typical West Germanic features, including a significant amount of grammatical [[inflection]]. Vocabulary came largely from the core Germanic stock, although due to the Germanic peoples' extensive contacts with the Roman world, the settlers' languages already included a number of [[loanword]]s from [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;Baugh, Albert and Cable, Thomas. 2002. ''The History of the English Language''. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall. pp. 79-81.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the predecessor of Modern English ''wine'' had been borrowed into early Germanic from the Latin ''vinum''.

''The Stories of English''. London: Penguin. pp. 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Old English continued to exhibit local variation, the remnants of which continue to be found in dialects of Modern English.&lt;ref name=OriginOfAngloSaxon /&gt; The four main dialects were [[Mercian dialect|Mercian]], [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian]], [[Kentish dialect (Old English)|Kentish]] and [[West Saxon dialect|West Saxon]]; the last of these formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period, although the dominant forms of Middle and Modern English would develop mainly from Mercian.

Old English was first written using a [[rune|runic]] script called the [[futhorc]], but this was replaced by a [[Old English Latin alphabet|version of the Latin alphabet]] introduced by Irish missionaries in the 9th century. Most literary output was in either the Early West Saxon of [[Alfred the Great]]'s time, or the Late West Saxon (regarded as the "classical" form of Old English) of the Winchester school inspired by Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester]] and followed by such writers as the prolific [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] ("the Grammarian"). The most famous surviving work from the Old English period is the [[epic poetry|epic]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', composed by an unknown poet.

The introduction of [[Christianity]] from around the year 600 encouraged the addition of over 400 [[Latin influence in English|Latin loan words]] into Old English, such as the predecessors of the modern ''priest'', ''paper'', and ''school'', and a smaller number of [[Greek language|Greek]] loan words.&lt;ref&gt;Baugh, Albert and Cable, Thomas. 2002. ''The History of the English Language''. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall. pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt; The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was also subject to strong [[Old Norse]] influence due to [[Danelaw|Scandinavian rule]] and settlement beginning in the 9th century (see below).

Most native English speakers today find Old English unintelligible, even though about half of the most commonly used words in Modern English have Old English roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/case-studies/geordie/ |title=Geordie dialect |publisher=Bl.uk |date=2007-03-12 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old English grammar|grammar of Old English]] was much more [[inflection|inflected]] than modern English, combined with freer [[word order]], and was grammatically quite similar in some respects to modern [[German grammar|German]]. The language had demonstrative pronouns (equivalent to ''this'' and ''that'') but did not have definite article ''the''. The Old English period is considered to have evolved into the [[Middle English]] period some time after the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066, when the language came to be influenced significantly by the new ruling class's language, [[Old Norman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb8/misc/lfb/html/text/4-1frame.html |title=4.1 The change from Old English to Middle English |publisher=Uni-kassel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford history of English lexicography, Volume 1'' By Anthony Paul Cowie&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandinavian influence===
{{Old Norse language map}}
[[Vikings]] from modern-day [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] began to [[Viking invasions of Britain|raid parts of Britain]] from the late 8th century onward. In 865, however, a major invasion was launched by what the Anglo-Saxons called the [[Great Heathen Army]], which eventually brought large parts of northern and eastern England (the [[Danelaw]]) under Scandinavian control. Most of these areas were retaken by the English under [[Edward the Elder]] in the early 10th century, although [[Scandinavian York|York]] and [[Northumbria]] were not permanently regained until the death of [[Eric Bloodaxe]] in 954. Scandinavian raids resumed in the late 10th century during the reign of [[Æthelred the Unready]], and [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] eventually succeeded in briefly being declared king of England in 1013, followed by the longer reign of his son [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] from 1016 to 1035, and Cnut's sons [[Harold Harefoot]] and [[Harthacnut]] until 1042.

The Scandinavians, or [[Norsemen]], spoke dialects of a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] language known as [[Old Norse]]. The Anglo-Saxons and the Scandinavians thus spoke related languages from different branches (West and North) of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] family; many of their lexical roots were the same or similar, although their grammatical systems were more divergent. Probably significant numbers of Norse speakers settled in the Danelaw during the period of Scandinavian control. Many [[toponymy|place-names]] in those areas are of Scandinavian provenance (those ending in ''-by'', for example); it is believed that the settlers often established new communities in places that had not previously been developed by the Anglo-Saxons. The extensive [[language contact|contact]] between Old English and Old Norse speakers, including the possibility of intermarriage that resulted from the [[Treaty of Wedmore|acceptance of Christianity by the Danes]] in 878,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fennell|first1=B|title=A History of English: A Sociolinguistic Approach|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; undoubtedly influenced the varieties of those languages spoken in the areas of contact. [[Middle English creole hypothesis|Some scholars even believe]] that Old English and Old Norse underwent a kind of fusion and that the resulting English language might be described as a [[mixed language]] or [[creole (language)|creole]]. During the rule of Cnut and other Danish kings in the first half of the 11th century, a kind of [[diglossia]] may have come about, with the West Saxon literary language existing alongside the Norse-influenced Midland dialect of English, which could have served as a [[koiné language|koine]] or spoken lingua franca. When Danish rule ended, and particularly after the [[Norman Conquest]], the status of the minority Norse language presumably declined relative to that of English, and its remaining speakers assimilated to English in a process involving [[language shift]] and [[language death]]. The widespread [[bilingualism]] that must have existed during the process possibly contributed to the rate of borrowings from Norse into English.&lt;ref name="CHEL320"&gt;Hogg, Richard M. (ed.). (1992). ''The Cambridge History of the English Language (Vol. 1): the Beginnings to 1066.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 320ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only about 100 or 150 Norse words, mainly connected with government and administration, are found in Old English writing. The borrowing of words of this type was stimulated by Scandinavian rule in the Danelaw and during the later reign of Cnut. However, most surviving Old English texts are based on the [[West Saxon dialect|West Saxon]] standard that developed outside the Danelaw; it is not clear to what extent Norse influenced the forms of the language spoken in eastern and northern England at that time. Later texts from the Middle English era, now based on an eastern Midland rather than a Wessex standard, reflect the significant impact that Norse had on the language. In all, English borrowed about [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|2000 words from Old Norse]], several hundred surviving in [[Modern English]].&lt;ref name="CHEL320" /&gt;

Norse borrowings include many very common words, such as ''anger'', ''bag'', ''both'', ''hit'', ''law'', ''leg'', ''same'', ''skill'', ''sky'', ''take'', ''window'', and even the pronoun ''[[they]]''. Norse influence is also believed to have reinforced the adoption of the plural [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]r verb form ''[[to be|are]]'' rather than alternative Old English forms like ''sind''. It is also considered to have stimulated and accelerated the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] simplification found in Middle English, such as the loss of [[grammatical gender]] and explicitly marked [[case (linguistics)|case]] (except in pronouns).&lt;ref&gt;Baugh, Albert and Cable, Thomas. 2002. ''The History of the English Language''. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall. pp. 92-105.&lt;/ref&gt; That is possibly confirmed by observations that simplification of the case endings occurred earliest in the north and latest in the southwest. The spread of [[phrasal verb]]s in English is another grammatical development to which Norse may have contributed (although here a possible [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] influence is also noted).&lt;ref name="CHEL320" /&gt;

==Middle English==
{{Main article|Middle English|Influence of French on English}}
[[Middle English]] is the form of English spoken roughly from the time of the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066 until the end of the 15th century.

For centuries after the Conquest, the Norman kings and high-ranking nobles in England and to some extent elsewhere in the British Isles spoke [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], a variety of [[Old Norman]], originating from a northern [[langues d'oïl|langue d'oïl]] dialect. Merchants and lower-ranked nobles were often bilingual in Anglo-Norman and English, whilst English continued to be the language of the common people. Middle English was influenced by both Anglo-Norman, and later Anglo-French (see [[Anglo-Norman language#Characteristics|characteristics of the Anglo-Norman language]]).

[[File:Wife-of-Bath-ms.jpg|thumb|Opening prologue of "[[The Wife of Bath's Tale]]" from the ''Canterbury Tales'']]
Until the 14th century, Anglo-Norman and then French were the language of the courts and government. Even after the decline of Norman, standard French retained the status of a formal or [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige language]], and about 10,000 French (and Norman) loan words entered Middle English, particularly terms associated with government, church, law, the military, fashion, and food&lt;ref&gt;Baugh, Albert and Cable, Thomas. 2002. ''The History of the English Language''. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall. pp. 158-178.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[English language#Word origins|English language word origins]] and [[List of English words of French origin]]). The strong influence of [[Old Norse]] on English (described in the previous section) also becomes apparent during this period. The impact of the native [[British Celtic languages]] that English continued to displace is generally held to be much smaller, although some attribute such analytic verb forms as the [[continuous aspect]] ("to be doing" or "to have been doing") to Celtic influence.&lt;ref&gt;Filppula, Markku, Juhani Klemola and Heli Pitkänen (eds.). 2002. ''The Celtic Roots of English.'' Joensuu: University of Joensuu, Faculty of Humanities.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David L. White ''On the Areal Pattern of ‘Brittonicity’ in English and Its Implications'' in Hildegard L. C. Tristram (ed.). 2006. ''The Celtic Englishes IV – The Interface Between English and the Celtic Languages''. Potsdam: University of Potsdam&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have also put forward [[Middle English creole hypothesis|hypotheses that Middle English was a kind of creole]] language resulting from contact between Old English and either Old Norse or Anglo-Norman.

English literature began to reappear after 1200, when a changing political climate and the decline in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] made it more respectable. The [[Provisions of Oxford]], released in 1258, was the first English government document to be published in the English language after the Norman Conquest. In 1362, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] became the first king to address Parliament in English. The [[Pleading in English Act 1362]] made English the only language in which court proceedings could be held, though the official record remained in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;''La langue française et la mondialisation'', Yves Montenay, Les Belles lettres, Paris, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the century, even the royal court had switched to English. Anglo-Norman remained in use in limited circles somewhat longer, but it had ceased to be a living language. Official documents began to be produced regularly in English during the 15th century. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], who lived in the late 14th century, is the most famous writer from the Middle English period, and ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is his best-known work.

The English language changed enormously during the Middle English period, both in vocabulary and pronunciation, and in grammar. While Old English is a heavily inflected language ([[synthetic language|synthetic]]), the use of [[grammatical case|grammatical endings]] diminished in Middle English ([[analytic language|analytic]]). Grammar distinctions were lost as many noun and adjective endings were [[morphological leveling|levelled]] to ''-e''. The older [[English plural|plural noun]] marker ''-en'' (retained in a few cases such as ''children'' and ''oxen'') largely gave way to ''-s'', and [[grammatical gender]] was discarded. Definite article ''þe'' appears around 1200, later spelled as ''the'', first appearing in East and North England as a substitute for Old English ''se'' and ''seo'', nominative forms of "that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Biography of the English Language|last=Millward|first=C. M.|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[English orthography|English spelling]] was also influenced by Norman in this period, with the {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} sounds being spelled ''th'' rather than with the Old English letters [[thorn (letter)|þ (thorn)]] and [[eth|ð (eth)]], which did not exist in Norman. These letters remain in the modern [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese orthography|Faroese alphabets]], having been borrowed from Old English via [[Old West Norse]].

==Early Modern English==
{{Main article|Early Modern English}}
English underwent extensive sound changes during the 15th century, while its spelling conventions remained largely constant. [[Modern English]] is often dated from the [[Great Vowel Shift]], which took place mainly during the 15th century. The language was further transformed by the spread of a standardized London-based dialect in government and administration and by the standardizing effect of printing, which also tended to regularize [[Capitalization in English|capitalization]]. As a result, the language acquired self-conscious terms such as "accent" and "dialect".&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David. 2004. ''The Stories of English''. London: Penguin. pp. 341-343.&lt;/ref&gt; As most early presses come from continental Europe, a few native English letters such as þ and ð die out; for some time ''þe'' is written as ''ye.'' By the time of [[William Shakespeare]] (mid 16th - early 17th century),&lt;ref&gt;See [[Fausto Cercignani]], ''Shakespeare's Works and Elizabethan Pronunciation'', Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; the language had become clearly recognizable as Modern English. In 1604, the first English dictionary was published, the ''[[Table Alphabeticall]]''.

Increased literacy and travel facilitated the adoption of many foreign words, especially borrowings from [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] from the time of the [[Renaissance]]. In the 17th century, Latin words were often used with their original inflections, but these eventually disappeared. As there are many words from different languages and English spelling is variable, the risk of [[mispronunciation]] is high, but remnants of the older forms remain in a few regional dialects, most notably in the [[West Country dialects|West Country]]. During the period, loan words were borrowed from Italian, German, and Yiddish. British acceptance of and resistance to [[Americanization|Americanisms]] began during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John. 2010. ''The Origins and Development of the English Language''. Boston, MA: Wadsworth. pp. 140-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern English==
[[File:JohnsonDictionary.png|thumb|Title page from the second edition of the ''Dictionary'']]
{{Main article|Modern English}}
The first authoritative and full-featured English dictionary, the ''[[Dictionary of the English Language]]'', was published by [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1755. To a high degree, the dictionary standardized both English spelling and word usage. Meanwhile, grammar texts by [[Robert Lowth|Lowth]], [[Lindley Murray|Murray]], [[Joseph Priestly|Priestly]], and others attempted to prescribe standard usage even further.

Early Modern English and Late Modern English, also called Present-Day English (PDE), differ essentially in vocabulary. Late Modern English has many more words, arising from the [[Industrial Revolution]] and technologies that created a need for new words, as well as international development of the language. The [[British Empire]] at its height covered one quarter of the Earth's land surface, and the English language adopted foreign words from many countries. British English and North American English, the two major varieties of the language, are together spoken by 400 million people. The total number of English speakers worldwide may exceed one billion.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John. 2010. ''The Origins and Development of the English Language''. Boston, MA: Wadsworth. pp. 182-187.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English language]] will almost certainly continue to evolve over time. With the development of computer and online environments (such as chat rooms, social media expressions, and apps), and the adoption of English as a worldwide [[lingua franca]] across cultures, customs, and traditions, it should not be surprising to see further shortening of words, phrases, and/or sentences.

==Phonological changes==
{{Main article|Phonological history of English}}
{{IPA notice|lang=en}}

===Introduction===
Over the last 1,200 years or so, English has undergone extensive changes in its vowel system but many fewer changes to its consonants.

In the [[Old English]] period, a number of [[umlaut (linguistics)|umlaut]] processes affected vowels in complex ways, and unstressed vowels were gradually eroded, eventually leading to a loss of [[grammatical case]] and [[grammatical gender]] in the Early Middle English period. The most important umlaut process was *[[Germanic umlaut#I-mutation in Old English|i-mutation]] (c. 500 CE), which led to pervasive alternations of all sorts, many of which survive in the modern language: e.g. in noun paradigms (''foot'' vs. ''feet'', ''mouse'' vs. ''mice'', ''brother'' vs. ''brethren''); in verb paradigms (''sold'' vs. ''sell''); nominal derivatives from adjectives ("strong" vs. "strength", ''broad'' vs. ''breadth'', ''foul'' vs. ''filth'') and from other nouns (''fox'' vs. "vixen"); verbal derivatives ("food" vs. "to feed"); and comparative adjectives ("old" vs. "elder"). Consonants were more stable, although [[velar consonant]]s were significantly modified by [[Old English phonology#Distribution of velars and palatals|palatalization]], which produced alternations such as ''speak'' vs. ''speech'', ''drink'' vs. ''drench'', ''wake'' vs. ''watch'', ''bake'' vs. ''batch''.

The [[Middle English]] period saw further vowel changes. Most significant was the [[Great Vowel Shift]] (c. 1500 CE), which transformed the pronunciation of all long vowels. This occurred after the spelling system was fixed, and accounts for the drastic differences in pronunciation between "short" ''mat, met, bit, cot'' vs. "long" ''mate, mete/meet, bite, coat''. Other changes that left echoes in the modern language were [[Middle English phonology#Homorganic lengthening|homorganic lengthening]] before ''ld'', ''mb'', ''nd'', which accounts for the long vowels in ''child'', ''mind'', ''climb'', etc.; [[Middle English phonology#Pre-cluster shortening|pre-cluster shortening]], which resulted in the vowel alternations in ''child'' vs. ''children'', ''keep'' vs. ''kept'', ''meet'' vs. ''met''; and [[trisyllabic laxing]], which is responsible for alternations such as ''grateful'' vs. ''gratitude'', ''divine'' vs. ''divinity'', ''sole'' vs. ''solitary''.

Among the more significant recent changes to the language have been the development of [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents]] (i.e. "r-dropping"); the [[trap-bath split]] in many dialects of [[British English]]; and [[flapping]] of ''t'' and ''d'' between vowels in [[American English]] and [[Australian English]].

==Grammatical changes==
The [[English language]] once had an extensive [[declension]] system similar to [[Latin]], modern [[German language|German]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. [[Old English language|Old English]] distinguished among the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]], and [[genitive case|genitive]] cases, and for strongly declined adjectives and some pronouns also a separate [[instrumental case]] (which otherwise and later completely coincided with the dative). In addition, the [[dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] was distinguished from the singular and plural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter S. Baker |url=http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/resources/IOE/inflpron.html |title=Pronouns |work=The Electronic Introduction to Old English |publisher=Oxford: [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911000749/http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/resources/IOE/inflpron.html |archivedate=September 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Declension was greatly simplified during the [[Middle English]] period, when the [[accusative case|accusative]] and [[dative case|dative]] cases of the pronouns merged into a single [[oblique case]] that also replaced the genitive case after prepositions. Nouns in Modern English no longer decline for case, except for the [[genitive]].

===Evolution of English pronouns===
Pronouns such as ''whom'' and ''him'' (contrasted with ''who'' and ''he''), are a conflation of the old accusative and dative cases, as well as of the genitive case after prepositions (while ''her'' also includes the genitive case). This conflated form is called the ''[[oblique case]]'' or the ''object (objective) case'', because it is used for objects of verbs (direct, indirect, or oblique) as well as for objects of prepositions. (See [[object pronoun]].) The information formerly conveyed by distinct case forms is now mostly provided by [[preposition]]s and word order. In Old English as well as modern [[German language|German]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] as further examples, these cases had distinct forms.

Although some grammarians continue to use the traditional terms "accusative" and "dative", these are functions rather than morphological cases in Modern English. That is, the form ''whom'' may play accusative or dative roles (as well as instrumental or prepositional roles), but it is a single [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] form, contrasting with nominative ''who'' and genitive ''whose''. Many grammarians use the labels "subjective", "objective", and "possessive" for nominative, oblique, and genitive pronouns.

Modern English nouns exhibit only one inflection of the reference form: the [[possessive case]], which some linguists argue is not a case at all, but a [[clitic]] (see the entry for [[genitive case]] for more information).

====Interrogative pronouns====

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; - In some dialects who is used where Formal English only allows whom, though variation among dialects must be taken into account. &lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - Usually replaced by ''of what'' (postpositioned).&lt;/small&gt;

====First person personal pronouns====

&lt;small&gt;Note that the ye/you distinction still existed, at least optionally, in Early Modern English: "Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free" from the [[King James Bible]].&lt;/small&gt;

Here the letter [[thorn (letter)|þ]] (interchangeable with [[Eth|ð]] in manuscripts) corresponds to ''th''. For ȝ, see [[Yogh]].

(The origin of the modern forms is generally thought to have been a borrowing from [[Old Norse]] forms þæir, þæim, þæira. The two different roots co-existed for some time, although currently the only common remnant is the shortened form ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;em''. Cf. also the demonstrative pronouns.)

Which, as translated by [[Francis Barton Gummere]], reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Lo, praise of the prowess of people-kings
of spear-armed Danes, in days long sped,
we have heard, and what honor the athelings won!
Oft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes,
from many a tribe, the mead-bench tore,
awing the earls. Since erst he lay
friendless, a foundling, fate repaid him:
for he waxed under welkin, in wealth he throve,
till before him the folk, both far and near,
who house by the whale-path, heard his mandate,
gave him gifts: a good king he!
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan===
This is the beginning of ''The Voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan'', a prose text in Old English dated to the late 9th century. The full text can be found at [[s:Bright's Anglo-Saxon Reader/The Voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan|Wikisource]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;

A translation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Ohthere from Hålogaland|Ohthere]] said to his lord, [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]], that he of all Norsemen lived north-most. He quoth that he lived in the land northward along the North Sea. He said though that the land was very long from there, but it is all wasteland, except that in a few places here and there Finns [i.e. [[Sami people|Sami]]] encamp, hunting in winter and in summer fishing by the sea. He said that at some time he wanted to find out how long the land lay northward or whether any man lived north of the wasteland. Then he traveled north by the land. All the way he kept the waste land on his starboard and the wide sea on his port three days. Then he was as far north as whale hunters furthest travel. Then he traveled still north as far as he might sail in another three days. Then the land bowed east (or the sea into the land — he did not know which). But he knew that he waited there for west winds (and somewhat north), and sailed east by the land so as he might sail in four days. Then he had to wait for due-north winds, because the land bowed south (or the sea into the land — he did not know which). Then he sailed from there south by the land so as he might sail in five days. Then a large river lay there up into the land. Then they turned up into the river, because they dared not sail forth past the river for hostility, because the land was all settled on the other side of the river. He had not encountered earlier any settled land since he travelled from his own home, but all the way waste land was on his starboard (except fishers, fowlers and hunters, who were all Finns). And the wide sea was always on his port. The [[Bjarmaland|Bjarmians]] have cultivated their land very well, but they did not dare go in there. But the Terfinn’s land was all waste except where hunters encamped, or fishers or fowlers.&lt;ref&gt;Original translation for this article: In this close translation readers should be able to see the correlation with the original.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire
That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
Rose out of Chaos: Or if Sion Hill
Delight thee more, and Siloa's Brook that flow'd
Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
That with no middle flight intends to soar
Above th' Aonian Mount, while it pursues
Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Oliver Twist===
A selection from the novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', written by [[Charles Dickens]] in Modern English and published in 1838:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The evening arrived: the boys took their places; the master in his cook's uniform stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out, and a long grace was said over the short commons. The gruel disappeared, the boys whispered each other and winked at Oliver, while his next neighbours nudged him. Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger and reckless with misery. He rose from the table, and advancing, basin and spoon in hand, to the master, said, somewhat alarmed at his own temerity—

"Please, sir, I want some more."

The master was a fat, healthy man, but he turned very pale. He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then clung for support to the copper. The assistants were paralysed with wonder, and the boys with fear.

"What!" said the master at length, in a faint voice.

"Please, sir," replied Oliver, "I want some more."

The master aimed a blow at Oliver's head with the ladle, pinioned him in his arms, and shrieked aloud for the beadle.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{History of Venezuela}}

'''[[Venezuela]]''' saw ten years of military dictatorship '''from 1948 to 1958'''. After the [[1948 Venezuelan coup d'état]] brought an end a three-year experiment in democracy ("[[El Trienio Adeco]]"), a triumvirate of military personnel controlled the government until 1952, when it held [[Venezuelan presidential election, 1952|presidential elections]]. These were free enough to produce results unacceptable to the government, leading them to be falsified, and to one of the three leaders, [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], assuming the Presidency. His government was brought to an end by the [[1958 Venezuelan coup d'état]] which saw the advent of democracy, with a transition government under Admiral [[Wolfgang Larrazábal]] in place until the [[Venezuelan general election, 1958|December 1958 elections]]. Prior to the elections, three of the main political parties (with the notable exclusion of the [[Communist Party of Venezuela]]) signed up to the [[Punto Fijo Pact]] power-sharing agreement.

==Background==
[[El Trienio Adeco]] was a three-year period in Venezuelan history, from 1945 to 1948, under the government of the [[marxism|marxist]] [[social democracy]] party [[Democratic Action]] (''Accion Democratica'' (AD), its adherents ''adecos''). The party gained office via the [[1945 Venezuelan coup d'état]] against President [[Isaías Medina Angarita]], named "The October Revolution" on October 18th 1945. and held the first general elections in Venezuelan history. The [[Venezuelan general election, 1947]] saw Democratic Action formally elected to office, but it was removed from office shortly after in the [[1948 Venezuelan coup d'état]].

There was no particular incident that set off the bloodless 1948 coup, which was led by colonel [[Carlos Delgado Chalbaud]]. There was no popular opposition. This might have meant that the odds were too great or that the pardo masses had not noticed any particular improvement in their lives despite the incessant government propaganda. All prominent adecos were expelled. The other parties were allowed but muzzled.

==Triumvirate (1948 - 1952)==
Delgado Chalbaud was twice a [[betray]]er, but Venezuelan historians tend to speak well of him, analogously as they argue in America that [[John F. Kennedy]] would not have allowed the Vietnam War to escalate. But both positions are contrafactual, hence un-provable. What is often said is that [[Delgado Chalbaud]] was planning to restore Venezuelan democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venezuelatuya.com/historia/biografias/carlos_delgado_chalbaud.htm |accessdate=May 21, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; If that was his intention, he did not get the chance to accomplish it. One day in November 1950, as he was being driven unescorted through a wooded part of [[Caracas]] towards the presidential palace, he was cut off by cars and kidnapped. His captors took him to an isolated house in southern Caracas. All versions of this incident are more or less agreed that someone's gun went off wounding the leader of the kidnappers, that Delgado Chalbaud was then hustled out of the car and he confronted his abductors, and that finally they shot him to death. The main kidnapper, his [[nephew]] Simon Urbina, who was bleeding badly, was soon captured and later, in the then official version, he was killed trying to flee. No one{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} accepts this version, which is why it is widely believed that it was his political partner, Pérez Jiménez, who had Delgado Chalbaud assassinated, nevertheless some believe this is unlikely since the wife of Pérez Jiménez, Doña [[Flor María Chalbaud]] Cardona de Pérez Jiménez, was Delgado Chalbaud's [[cousin]].

==Pérez Jiménez dictatorship (1952 - 1958)==
Delgado Chalbaud had formed a triumvirate with Pérez Jiménez and Luis Felipe Llovera Páez. With his death, the remaining triumvirs chose a civilian president, [[Germán Suárez Flamerich|Luis Germán Suárez Flamerich]], who was dismissed by the military in 1952, and the ambitious Pérez Jiménez became dictator with the consent of Llovera Páez. The former majors, who had risen to colonels in the democracy, were now generals. Pérez Jiménez himself was physically not very impressive. He was short, balding, and tubby, and read speeches monotonously, although surely on the personal level he must have had some magnetism. He was a megalomaniac of much character that when a Time magazine interviewer asked him what Rome's greatest legacy was, he said, : "Its ruins", apparently wanting to give the impression that while the ruins of Rome were all that remained of its greatness, his own greatness will surpass them with his visionary building projects. In some ways, this is understandable. Pérez Jiménez, unlike most Venezuelans, received a thorough education from the military academies of Venezuela and Peru which he attended and graduated from with the highest honors.

By the time he came to power, Pérez Jiménez had developed a flair for [[fascist]] opulence, boasting about his projects aimed at making Venezuela the major power of South America. The greatest of Venezuelan writers at the time (and for a long time after that) was [[Arturo Uslar Pietri]] and he became famous on television with analytical biographies of great historical figures. Uslar Pietri had a felicitous phrase: "Sow the oil" ("Sembrar el petroleo" in Spanish), which became a national slogan meaning that the state's oil income should be productively invested. But in Venezuela "sowing the oil" implied "sowers" and the country did not have too many of these. In fact, it was the undeclared understanding that "sowing the oil" really meant "give Venezuelans employment by creating government jobs".

The other reason for Pérez Jiménez's "ruins revelation" was that what he intended to do as president, apart from becoming rich, which he did, like general [[Juan Vicente Gomez]], with his own military and civilian cronies, was to build and build and build, and here too he was undeniably successful. It is only fair to point out here that while Gomez did become immensely rich, he never had a foreign bank account and even though Pérez Jiménez was not as rich as Gomez, all his money was sent to offshore accounts. Pérez Jiménez also had an efficient secret police, but the stories about tortures and killings were, like those about Gomez, mainly inventions by the frustrated adecos{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}, although whoever in Venezuela tried to be active clandestinely was sure to be either imprisoned or shot if he resisted. Like Gomez, Pérez Jiménez had a theoretician, [[Laureano Vallenilla Lanz]], who happened to be the son of Gomez's own historian and had his father's persuasions. Like his father, Laureano was also a racist which became a factor when he authored the national immigration policy. By the time Pérez Jiménez had all the power in his hands, which despite his uninspiring qualities he did manage to do, Venezuela had around five million inhabitants. Depending on which measures you apply, the country can be said to have been under-populated. If you consider, for instance, that population density is not necessarily good, then it could be argued that Venezuela was not under-populated but under-educated. Vallenilla Lanz and Pérez Jiménez's idea was to open the doors of the country to as many Europeans as wanted to come, with which they, and many non-[[pardo]] Venezuelans, believed that two flies would be killed with one swat: the country's population would grow, but not with more uneducated pardos but with Europeans who brought with them, however lowly they might have been in their own countries, a higher than average education compared to most Venezuelans. The policy backfired as the immigrants were from the exact countries that had given rise to the existence of pardos.

Up to a point, this kind of social engineering might have been defensible, but the immigrants, who came from Spain, Portugal, and Italy on the rationale that they would adapt better to Venezuela and Venezuelans would adapt better to them (than, say, to Swedes), did not emigrate from their countries to give Venezuelans lessons in civics. They came for a better income and the majority of the roughly two million who did come returned home as soon as they had made enough to live better in their own lands. This emigration peaked during the 1980s, when Venezuela's economy took a tumble. It is possible that the proportion of the white population in Venezuela might have increased slightly. Many of the emigrants did make a lot of money and chose Venezuela as their country, but as to industrializing or increasing agricultural production, their effect was not and is not noticeable; and this for the simple reason that the Venezuelan government considered that diversified industrial development was its responsibility and private citizens of any nationality—in this sense, it can be said that Venezuela is perhaps the most un-discriminatory country in the world—were given ample rights in the areas of commerce, of services, and of other ancillary activities. Despite this insidious racism, it was under Pérez Jiménez that the mythification of the Amerindian [[caciques]], who supposedly had resisted the conquistadors everywhere in Venezuela, was given a big boost, especially when an exchange house founded by an Italian immigrant (Italcambio) brought out a series of souvenir gold coins in which each cacique was depicted with facial traits that were invented out of whole cloth by Pérez Jiménez's laureate painter, Pedro Francisco Vallenilla. Despite his rigorous Catholic upbringing, Pérez Jiménez also encouraged the underlying animism of Venezuelans when he erected in the middle of Caracas’ first speedway a statue of [[Maria Lionza]], a sort of Amerindian goddess who sits atop a tapir and is much worshipped in a jungle sanctuary in [[Yaracuy]] in central Venezuela.

Pérez Jiménez, confident that he had done good work as dictator, scheduled [[Venezuelan presidential election, 1952|elections for 1952]]. His official party ran against [[COPEI]] and [[Unión Republicana Democrática|URD]], which had only managed puny showings against [[AD]] in the presidential election of 1947. When the time came to vote, Venezuela's pardos wanted their adecos back and the exiled leadership of the party let it be known that it wanted URD to win. As the results started coming in showing that AD was still the political top dog in Venezuela, Pérez Jiménez shut down the polls, and the country, and after a few days, during which he probably was making sure that he counted with the loyalty of his generals, he published results that were so lopsidedly in his favor as to seem ludicrous. Pérez Jiménez thus inaugurated himself for another five years as president, and just as he had intended from the beginning.

He went on spending on infrastructure and way beyond this to gigantic industrial, agricultural, and power-generating projects. In foreign affairs, Venezuela was a faithful ally of the American government, although servile would probably be more to the point. When the government of the socialist [[Jacobo Arbenz]] in [[Guatemala]] was implementing real social reforms in a country that badly needed them, Venezuela was host to a conference of the OAS ([[Organization of American States]]) in which Guatemala was ostracized. Shortly afterwards the [[CIA]] sponsored a coup in which Arbenz was overthrown. Pérez Jiménez also changed entirely the face of Caracas with a building program such as the city had not seen since Guzman Blanco, and compared to what Pérez Jiménez built, Guzman's buildings, one of which Pérez Jiménez had cut at the nose, were dwarfs. The author of this "face lifting" was [[Luis Malausena]], whose taste was in all to Pérez Jiménez's sense of grandeur and went from the ultra-modern to a non-descript "neo-classicism". The Caracas that one sees today is, then, the unimaginative creation of a character whom no one remembers, and no one probably will{{Or|date=November 2009}} as, after he made millions upon millions, he fled the country with Pérez Jiménez, never to be seen again. ''[[Caraqueño]]s'', incidentally, have never{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} complained about the legacy of Malausena.

The next presidential election fell due by the end of 1957. Pérez Jiménez thought he had learned from the 1952 political debacle and instead of an election he decreed a plebiscite on his government. He probably knew he wasn’t going to win this one either, so the results were rigged. The people who queued to vote were civil servants and indirect employees of the government and its subordinate companies and institutions, who were instructed to show some proof that they had voted for the regime, usually by presenting the "no" card, although this was a silly ploy. All the government needed was a turnout, and that is what it got. Economically, Venezuela apparently was not doing so badly, but the signs of prosperity were mostly in the cities, and the countryside, where half of Venezuelans still lived, had social indexes way below what would have been expected from such a fiscally rich country.

==1958 coup d'état==
{{See also|1958 Venezuelan coup d'état}}

===Background===
On 11 June 1957 [[Fabricio Ojeda]] had invited two other [[Democratic Republican Union]] (URD) members and a Communist, Guillermo Garcia Ponce, to his home, and they agreed that the time was ripe to form a multi-partisan organisation aiming to overthrow Jiménez. The Patriotic Junta was soon joined by [[Democratic Action]] and [[COPEI]], and used the only clandestine press left in Venezuela, that of the [[Communist Party of Venezuela]], to publish a manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, Glen L. (1974), ''Democracy and Dictatorship in Venezuela, 1945 - 1958'', Connecticut College. p. 165, {{ISBN|9780208014160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Junta ultimately played a leading role in coordinating the coup d'état that took place on 23 January 1958,&lt;ref&gt;Kolb (1974:174-8)&lt;/ref&gt; including organising a general strike on 21 January.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Robert J. (1982), ''Romulo Betancourt and the Transformation of Venezuela'', [[Transaction Books]], p. 388, {{ISBN|0-87855-450-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===31 December 1957===
Pérez Jiménez's illegitimacy was so patent that some officers conspired to overthrow him. There was also some cautious civilian clandestine agitation. On the last day of 1957, a military uprising coordinated by officers of air and tank forces struck, but the coordination was not that good. The air force rebels flew over Caracas and dropped randomly some bombs while a commander started out from [[Maracay]] with a column of tanks. Somehow the signals got crossed, the tanks turned back, and the pilots fled the country. These officers probably thought that Pérez Jiménez would turn tail in the face of this demonstration, but the bulk of the armed forces remained loyal.

===January 1958===
[[File:Museo Aeronáutico 2.jpg|thumb|200px|''La Vaca Sagrada'', in which Marcos Pérez Jiménez fled to the Dominican Republic.]]
However, this show of defiance did set off a sequence of events which eventually made Pérez Jiménez fear for his political survival. The underground civilian opponents started goading the people in Caracas, where they needed little goading and were out in the streets whenever and wherever they could. The repressive secret police rounded up all civilian suspects, but this was like trying to do [[Hans Brinker or the Silver Skates|the little Dutch boy trick]]. The popular resistance to the government was not just a pardo thing and reached to all levels of society. The navy had taken a non-committal attitude in a situation where its guns were not of any service. It was not in on any conspiracy. There were signs of restiveness in the land forces with some officers working to rules, so to speak, but there was not at any time a military insurrection. But the crowds were getting bigger and bigger. Finally, with various suitcases stuffed with dollars, Pérez Jiménez took off in his private DC-3 and sought refuge in the [[Dominican Republic]], where his resilient colleague, [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]], had been ruling since 1930.

===Transition===
The flight of the dictator ushered in an amazing incident in the history of Venezuela. Pérez Jiménez had been unsure of whom to trust. He was arbitrary and authoritarian but there is no evidence that he was particularly courageous. Like Guzman Blanco, he possibly considered that hanging on to power was not worth the effort, especially considering that his fortune would allow him to live royally outside of Venezuela. When he fled, the country was for all practical purposes leaderless. The Caracas masses had no leader, because no one in the streets had the stature to be one, and any potential leader was in jail. For various days before his hasty departure, Pérez Jiménez had not been giving any inspiration or even orders to the army generals loyal to him, which were still a majority. There were junior officers here and there acting on their own. A military committee was functioning in the military academy. When these officers received word that Pérez Jiménez had left, they felt - reasonably enough - that it was up to them to exercise authority. Thus it was that [[Wolfgang Larrazábal]], an admiral who owed to Pérez Jiménez his rise in the services and who had never manifested any disaffection to him, was chosen to lead the country solely because he outranked every one else. Had Pérez Jiménez ordered the commander of the Caracas garrison to arrest any officer not at his post and to put the fear of volleys into the crowds, he would have been obeyed, so in some way it redounds to his credit that, like Medina Angarita before him, he ran because he did not want bloodshed, although Medina had not run at all but had been imprisoned and released. As soon as it became unmistakable that Pérez Jiménez was out, the exiled politicians started streaming in. Larrazábal was made head of a civilian-military junta. Overnight, without having lifted a finger to deserve it, Larrazábal became the idol of Caracas, though in the rest of Venezuela the pardos were still adecos to the tip of their tails.

==Venezuelan transition to democracy==
1958 marked a crucial year in Venezuelan contemporary history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Ramirez-Faria|1978| Ref= Ramirez-Faria1978 }} Concise Encyclopeida Of World History, {{ISBN|9788126907755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larrazábal was a fluke. He had no more legitimacy than Pérez Jiménez and no sooner was the new government installed, committed to democratic elections before the end of the year, than the question of who really had overthrown Pérez Jiménez, the military uprising or the Caracas masses, became a disquieting issue. The original rebellious officers felt that they were entitled to rule and started brewing their own conspiracies. But Larrazábal was generally accepted as the leader of the armed forces. Most importantly, the political parties, which were busily rebuilding their national organizations, gave him their total support, including the few but vociferous communists. As before, it was Betancourt who proved the master organizer through his revived AD party. Another source of support for Larrazábal was that he decreed demagogic measures to conciliate the discontented masses. These measures were being legislated in an [[ad hoc]] manner and one in particular, the most influential, was completely irrational.

A so-called Emergency Plan gave [[unemployment benefit|hand-outs to those who could claim they were unemployed]]. These popular subsidies were far above what the average Venezuelan earned in the rural areas and there followed inevitably a flood of migrants to Caracas, a city that before had few [[shantytowns]], and settled and built shacks on the hillsides on the eastern and western edges of the valley in which Caracas nestles. The population of the city soon doubled with these rural, barely educated newcomers, who were obviously strongly pro-Larrazábal but were also a potential source of political de-stabilization. The pardos in effect became a force to be reckoned with in the forthcoming elections. But before these took place many things were occurring. The officers who felt they had been cheated staged various insurrections, even to an "invasion" by one of them from Colombia who managed to take over [[San Cristóbal, Táchira|San Cristobal]], the capital of [[Táchira (state)|Táchira]] state. All these conspiracies were contained although some required drastic means and at one point the Larrazábal government was in real danger of being toppled. The armed forces were instrumental in quelling the revolts, but each time there was one, Caracas mobs went wild prodded by the politicians.

The most menacing of these popular riots took place in May 1958 when U.S. vice-president [[Richard Nixon]] and his wife [[Pat Nixon|Pat]] visited Venezuela.  Nixon represented the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] administration, which had conferred on Pérez Jiménez the [[Legion of Merit]]. The Venezuelan government had not anticipated the raging public reaction to this emissary from Washington, possibly because it thought that it had assuaged public indignation by allowing the hysterical daily denigration of the former dictator. Venezuelans were not that versed in foreign affairs, but the communists were and it was at their instigation that crowds assaulted Nixon's motorcade along an avenue that ran close to where many shantytowns had grown, ironically not far from a huge apartment complex that Pérez Jiménez had built for workers. Before the Venezuelan army intervened—preventing a ready-to-go Marines intervention—Nixon's car had been rocked back and forth, its windows had been smashed, and the vice-president and his wife had been thoroughly drenched in spit. As would be expected, once safe in the American embassy residence, Nixon let loose with imprecations and he returned quickly to the U.S. It says well of him that when he reported on his trip, which was meant as a fact-finding and conciliatory gesture to Latin America, he stressed that his country was partly to blame for the unfriendly reception in Caracas.

During the [[Cuban Revolution]] of the 1950s, a number of liberal organisations in Venezuela declared their support for Fidel Castro's guerrilla operations against [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]]. The Venezuelan government refrained from taking a position on the Cuban rebellion, but unofficially during Larrazábal's Presidency contributed 50,000 dollars to Castro's revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Liss, p 172. He cites Venezuela, Oficina Central de Información, ''Six Years of Aggression'' (Caracas, 1967), p 16. {{ISBN|9781462834600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
{{See also|Punto Fijo Pact|Venezuelan general election, 1958}}
As the elections approached, the three main parties, [[Democratic Action]], [[COPEI]] and [[Democratic Republican Union]] (URD), initiated talks to form a united political front "in defence of democracy". This implied, if not a single candidate chosen among them, at least an understanding for future cooperation in ruling Venezuela. The pact, known as the [[Punto Fijo Pact]] (hence ''puntofijismo'') remained essentially in place until [[Hugo Chávez]]' victory in 1998. The wily Betancourt, who sometimes is referred to as the "father of Venezuelan democracy" (much less in {{As of| 2009 | alt = recent times}} than before), insisted that the [[Communist Party of Venezuela]] were not to be included in the political talks, and excluded they were but took it very calmly. The chances of one candidate were slim and nothing came out of the negotiations except a well-meaning consensus that the parties would stick together in the defence of democracy from whatever threats might arise in the future. This meant that the electoral process was on and that each party had to look itself.

Another significant pact that emerged during 1958 was the unspoken one by which the civilian political leadership, particularly [[Rómulo Betancourt]], agreed not to interfere with the military in any way and let them run their own affairs. The military in their turn pledged that they would not allow politicization within their ranks — to the extent that they even renounced their own right to vote (voting became compulsory for the rest of the Venezuelans).

AD knew that it remained the most popular party all over Venezuela: it chose Betancourt as its candidate. [[Rafael Caldera]] had no rivals in COPEI, the party he founded, and he entered the political fray counting on the conservative middle class. [[Jóvito Villalba]] and his URD party adopted an opportunistic strategy, which was practically an admission that they could not compete with the AD national pardo popular base. It was the pardo masses in Caracas that Villalba was targeting when, instead of nominating himself, he chose Larrazábal, who also had the communists with him, to be the URD candidate. Larrazábal turned over the provisional presidency to a civilian, [[Edgar Sanabria]], in October, and went on the campaign trail. When the results were in, Betancourt was elected for the term that ended in 1964, but this time by a plurality and not the absolute majorities that AD had achieved in 1946 and 1947. Caracas was no longer an AD redoubt. The city from then on became a marginal that could swing in any direction and this time it went all out for Larrazábal, who came in second. Caldera did not do badly in third place and received proportionally more votes than he had in 1947. But the Venezuelan panorama was cloudy at best.

'''Independence II''' was a [[Paleo-Eskimo]] culture that flourished in northern and northeastern [[Greenland]] from around 700 to 80 BC, north and south of the [[Independence Fjord]]. The Independence II culture existed in roughly the same areas of Greenland as the [[Independence I culture]], which became extinct six centuries before the beginning of Independence II.

Independence II is attested in northern Greenland by settlements on central [[Peary Land]]. There, it is estimated that the Independence II population was of no more than four to six families, and that it must therefore have been in contact with people of Ellesmere island in Canada or with people in north-eastern Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bjarne Grønnow|author2=Jens Fog Jensen|title=The Northernmost Ruins of the Globe|series=Man and Society|volume=29|ISBN=87-90369-65-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|339}}

It has been argued that there is virtually no difference in the material cultures of Independence II and the contemporary [[Dorset culture]] in southern Greenland, locally known as Dorset I. Those that lump these two entities together refer to them jointly as ''Greenlandic Dorset''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of the Prehistoric Arctic|title=Greenlandic Dorset|author=Jens Fog Jensen|DOI=

The '''[[International law]]''' bearing on issues of '''[[Arab–Israeli conflict]]''', which became a major arena of regional and international tension since the birth of [[Israel]] in 1948, [[history of the Arab–Israeli conflict|resulting]] in several disputes between a number of [[Arab League|Arab countries]] and Israel.

There is an international consensus that some of the actions of the states involved in the Arab–Israeli conflict violate international law,&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Richard (July 20, 2004). [http://www.merip.org/newspaper_opeds/oped072004.html "Support for Wall Mocks International law"]. ''Miami Herald''. -- "What is most remarkable about the International Court of Justice decision [...] is the strength of the consensus behind it. By a vote of 14–1, the 15 distinguished jurists who make up the highest judicial body on the planet found that the barrier is illegal under international law [...] The International Court of Justice has very rarely reached this degree of unanimity in big cases. The July 9 decision was even supported by the generally conservative British judge Rosalyn Higgins".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See article section [[International law and the Arab–Israeli conflict#"Occupied" vs. "Disputed" territories|"Occupied" vs. "Disputed" territories]]: "[the] international consensus, excepting the US in some cases, is that [the] annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem are illegal and not recognized by international law" {{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but some of the involved states dispute this.&lt;ref&gt;Klapper, Bradley S. (November 13, 2008) [https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-11-13-3686107338_x.htm "Switzerland says Israel breaking international law"] Associated Press. -- "An Israeli Embassy spokeswoman [...] said the decision [...] was sanctioned by law."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, Israel invaded and occupied territory that had itself been invaded and occupied by neighboring [[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]] in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. Following the peace treaties between [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|Israel and Egypt]] and [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty|Israel and Jordan]], in which the states relinquished their claims to the Israeli-occupied territory, the conflict today mostly revolves around the [[Palestinians]].

The main points of dispute (also known as the "core issues" or "final status issues") are the following:
* Israel's annexation of [[East Jerusalem]] (Israel has also annexed the [[Golan Heights]], but that territory isn't claimed by Palestinians), construction of [[Israeli settlements]] in the [[Palestinian territories]] and the erection of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]];
* how borders should be decided between Israel and a [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|Palestinian state]];
* the [[Palestinian right of return|right of return]] of the [[Palestinian refugees]] from the 1948 and 1967 wars.

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] has voted on a [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolution]] bearing on issues of international law as applied to the conflict every year since 1974.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unbisnet.un.org:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=WD78W86178392.19882&amp;menu=search&amp;aspect=power&amp;npp=50&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;profile=voting&amp;ri=1&amp;source=~!horizon&amp;index=.VW&amp;term=palestine+question&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;aspect=power|title=United Nations Bibliographic Information System Search Results: Palestine Question  |date=May 1, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customary international law==
Unlike a [[Treaty|treaty agreement]], [[customary international law]] is usually not written. Customs of a longstanding nature can be codified by formal treaties. The Laws and Customs of War on Land ([[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention IV]]) of 18 October 1907&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm |title=The Avalon Project: Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy |publisher= |accessdate=22 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525082008/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm |archivedate=25 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 are examples of conventional laws that are declarations of customary law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/icty/icty.html Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Security Council Resolution 827, 25 May 1993] The drafters of the Statute had explicitly declined to make it a self-contained criminal code. They instead granted the Tribunal jurisdiction over a set of very broadly defined crimes, the specific content of which was to be found in customary international law. Though the Tribunal recognized that binding conventional law could also provide the basis for its jurisdiction, it has in practice always determined that the treaty provisions in question are also declaratory of custom.&lt;/ref&gt;
To prove that a certain rule is customary one has to show that it is reflected in state practice and that there exists a conviction in the international community that such practice is required as a matter of law. In this context, "practice" relates to official state practice and therefore includes formal statements by states. A contrary practice by some states is possible because if this contrary practice is condemned by the other states, or subsequently denied by the government itself, the original rule is actually confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/customary-law|title=Customary law|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with article 13 of the [[UN Charter]], the General Assembly is obligated to initiate studies and to make recommendations that encourage the progressive development of international law and its codification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/unchart.htm#art13|title=The Avalon Project: United Nations Charter; June 26, 1945|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421122334/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/unchart.htm#art13|archivedate=21 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting in that agreed-upon treaty capacity, the General Assembly affirmed the principles of international law that were recognized by the [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imtconst.asp Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal] and directed that they should be codified.&lt;ref&gt;See General Assembly Resolution 95 (I), 11 December 1946, and [[UN General Assembly Resolution 177]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those same principles were subsequently adopted for inclusion in draft treaties that were under development by the [[International Law Commission|International Law Commission of the United Nations]]. They were also incorporated through the agreement of the High Contracting Parties into the Geneva Conventions of 1949.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Nuremberg Principles]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/19970706135706/http://www.deoxy.org/wc/wc-nurem.htm Principles of the Nuremberg Tribunal, 1950]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the [[UN Security Council]] "acting under Chapter VII of the Charter on the United Nations" established an international tribunal and approved a Statute that had been recommended in a report submitted by the [[UN Secretary-General]]. It concluded beyond doubt that the law applicable in armed conflict as embodied in the [[Geneva Conventions]] of 12 August 1949 and the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention (IV) of 18 October 1907]] had become part of international customary law, and should be part of the subject matter jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]. In 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries approved the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]]. The offenses against unwritten customary international law were amenable to prosecution by international tribunals, like the Nuremberg Tribunal, long before they were codified and incorporated into the subsequent treaties.

==Conventions, resolutions and declarations==

Many provisions of international law are based upon principles and norms that were developed in the Americas during the 19th century. They include the principle of uti possidetis of 1810&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pbosnia.kentlaw.edu/symposium/resources/hasani-fletcher.htm#Document2zzFN_B6|title=Hasani – Uti Possidetis|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the related [[Monroe Doctrine]] of 1823, regarding non-colonization and non-intervention. In 1890, the [[First International Conference of American States]] adopted a proscription against territorial conquest and agreed upon the non-recognition of all acquisitions made by force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/chapul.asp|title=The Avalon Project : Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance and Solidarity (Act of Chapultepec); March 6, 1945|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Those principles and regional understandings were recognized in  Article 21 of the Covenant of the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/leagcov.asp#art21|title=Avalon Project – The Covenant of the League of Nations|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system of mandates contained in article 22 of the Covenant was based in part upon those normative declarations and state practices. The [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] of 1928, and the League of Nations approval of the [[Stimson Doctrine]] in 1931 were efforts designed to end the practice of coercive territorial revisionism through international law.

After [[World War II]], the principles of international law that upheld the [[territorial integrity]] of states were incorporated in the Charter of the United Nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/unchart.htm#art2|title=The Avalon Project : United Nations Charter; June 26, 1945|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421122334/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/unchart.htm#art2|archivedate=21 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently reaffirmed in the [[Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples]], the [[Organization of African Unity]] charter respecting the integrity of inherited boundaries, and the 1975 CSCE Helsinki Final Act which contained a proscription that boundaries could only be altered by consent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mWz-5-qq8rMC&amp;pg=PA278 ''International Law and International Relations''], Beth A. Simmons and Richard H. Steinberg, Cambridge University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-521-86186-1}}, pp. 278–279&lt;/ref&gt; The Chapter on Fundamental Rights and Duties of States in the Charter of the Organization of American States provides that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The territory of a State is inviolable; it may not be the object, even temporarily, of military occupation or of other measures of force taken by another State, directly or indirectly, on any grounds whatever. No territorial acquisitions or special advantages obtained either by force or by other means of coercion shall be recognized.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legal issues related to sovereignty==
In their relations with other peoples and countries during the colonial era the Concert of Europe adopted a fundamental legal principle that the supreme legal authority, or sovereignty, lay outside the indigenous nations. That legal principle resulted in the creation of a large number of dependent states with restricted sovereignty or colonial autonomy. Various terms were used to describe different types of dependent states, such as condominium, mandate, protectorate, colony, and vassal state. After World War II there was strong international pressure to eliminate dependencies associated with colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://law.jrank.org/pages/6068/Dependent-States.html American Law Encyclopedia Vol 3, Dependent States], [http://www.un-documents.net/ch-11.htm The Declaration Regarding Non-Self-Governing Territories, in Chapter XI of the UN Charter], and [http://www.un-documents.net/a15r1514.htm The Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of the world's [[sovereignty|sovereign]] states resulted from the grant of independence to colonial peoples and dependent territories. Prior to World War II  many states were formed as a result of [[war]]s that were resolved through [[Peace treaty|peace treaties]]. Some of these peace treaties were imposed on the losing side in a war; others came about as a result of negotiations that followed wars, or were entered into under the threat of war. In these cases, the applicable law was bound in peace treaties among the states. The practice of territorial aggrandizement was prohibited by the UN Charter, a multilateral treaty, and the authoritative explanation of its legal principles contained in UN General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, Declaration of Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3dda1f104.html|title=Refworld – Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the United Nations is the prevention and removal of threats to peace and the suppression of acts of aggression. The Charter requires that members shall refrain from the threat of, or use of force. According to ''communis opinio'' the obligations imposed by those provisions of the Charter have become part of customary international law and are binding on all States, whether they are members of the United Nations or not.&lt;ref&gt;The International Law Commission's Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Part 1, Articles 1–35, By United Nations International Law Commission, Compiled by Shabtai Rosenne, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1991, {{ISBN|0-7923-1179-5}}, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treaties and resolutions===

The communities and Holy Places of Palestine have been under the express protection of international law since the early 19th century. For example, the International Court of Justice advisory opinion noted that access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places had been protected by various laws dating back to the early Ottoman Empire, with the latest provisions having been incorporated into the UN Partition Plan, article 13 of the League of Nations Mandate, and Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878.

The Treaty of Paris in 1814 called for a congress of the Great Powers of Europe to settle the future boundaries of the continent. Nearly every state in Europe was represented, and among other things a prohibition on unilateral annexation was adopted. This bolstered the concept of territorial integrity, which was enshrined in the Congress of Vienna in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/26.3/benvenisti.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207231639/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/26.3/benvenisti.html |archivedate=2011-02-07 |df= }} Benvenisti, Eyal, The Origins of the Concept of Belligerent Occupation. Law and History Review 26.3 (2008): 46 pars. 1 Jul. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1856 Treaty of Paris declared that the Sublime Porte, the government of the Ottoman Empire, had been admitted to participate in the Public Law and System (Concert) of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;International Law: Achievements and Prospects, by Mohammed Bedjaoui (Editor), UNESCO, Martinus Nijhoff, 1991, {{ISBN|92-3-102716-6}}, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The European system of public law governed territorial accessions and the creation of new states. After the Russo-Turkish Wars in 1878, Russia and the Ottoman Empire concluded the Treaty of San Stefano. Because it modified the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1856, the other signatories called for a Congress to obtain its revision. The Treaty of Berlin of 1878 was the result. Montenegro, Serbia, and Romania were recognized as new independent states and granted specific territory on condition that religious, political, and property rights of minorities were guaranteed on a nondiscriminatory basis.&lt;ref&gt;See Defending the Rights of Others: The Great Powers, the Jews, and International Minority Protection, 1878–1938, Carole Fink, Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-521-02994-5}}, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The delegates of the [[First Zionist Congress]] acknowledged these customary diplomatic precedents in the [[Basle Program]]. It stated that the aim of Zionism was the creation of a home for the Jewish people in Palestine, ''secured by public law''.

During the course of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British mandate in Palestine]], the [[British government]] sought to reconcile the two claims in different ways. A number of proposals and declarations were put forward, all of which were rejected by one party or the other, and usually both. Again, two different interpretations apply:
* The Israeli perspective is that the [[United Kingdom]] only had the mandate to propose solutions in keeping with the resolutions adopted at the [[San Remo Conference]], not to amend them.  In other words, that the relevant resolutions adopted at the San Remo Conference are the public law that awarded the Jewish people de jure sovereignty over Palestine.{{Dubious| date=December 2011}}
* The Arab perspective views British proposals as promises (subsequently broken) to the people of Palestine, see also the [[Hussein-McMahon Correspondence]].  {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

After [[World War II]], the British government decided to abandon its mandate in Palestine. A [[United Nations]] Commission ([[UNSCOP]]) was assigned to recommend a solution to the conflict to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The recommendation was a [[1947 UN Partition Plan|partition plan]] that would result in an Arab and a Jewish state in the remaining mandate, and [[Jerusalem]] under UN rule, was approved by the General Assembly.

However, the resolution served partially as a basis for the [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} to take effect when Great Britain's mandate expired. Many states granted the State of Israel either ''[[de facto]]'' or ''[[de jure]]'' recognition. Israel was accepted as a sovereign member state in the United Nations and has [[Foreign relations of Israel|diplomatic relations]] with many, but not all, sovereign states.

===The legal consequence of subsequent events===
Several events have affected the legal issues related to the conflict:
* After the war in 1948, the mandate ended up being split between Israel, [[Egypt]] and Jordan. Israel and [[Rule of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|Jordan annexed]] all areas under their administration; [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Egypt maintained a military occupation of Gaza]]. The United Nations attempted to assert its authority over Jerusalem but the designated mediator, [[Folke Bernadotte|Count Bernadotte]], was killed by the militant [[Zionism|Zionist]] group [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] while pursuing his official duties, and the city ended up being split between Israel and Jordan. Lehi had feared that Israel would agree to Bernadotte's peace proposals, which they considered disastrous, unaware that the provisional Israeli government had already rejected a proposal by Bernadotte the day before.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ilan, ''Bernadotte in Palestine'', 1948 (Macmillan, 1989) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although there were numerous informal and backchannel communications between Israel and Arab states through the years, all Arab states refused to accept Israel's sovereignty until 1979, and most (excluding [[Jordan]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Egypt]]) persisted in rejecting Israel's desire to exist (see [[Khartoum Resolution]]) until the 2002 [[Arab Peace Initiative]] that offers Israel peace and normal relations with all Arab countries if Israel withdraws from all areas occupied in the 1967 war and "attain a just solution" to the [[Palestinian refugee]] problem "to be agreed upon in accordance with the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|UN General Assembly Resolution 194]]".
* The [[Six-Day War|war in 1967]] brought all remaining parts of the Mandate (as defined by Great Britain in 1947) as well as parts of the Golan Heights under Israeli administration. Israel subsequently effectively [[annexed]] [[East Jerusalem]], asserting that the West Bank and Gaza were "[[disputed territories]]". The United Nations Security Council rejected the effective annexation of East Jerusalem and Golan Heights as "null and void" in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 497]] respectively, and consider Israel to hold the Gaza Strip, the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|West Bank, including East Jerusalem]], and the Golan Heights under [[military occupation]]
* Both as a result of the wars in 1948 and 1967, Arab residents of the former Mandate were displaced and classified by the United Nations as "[[Palestinian refugee|refugees]]"
* In approximately the same time frame, most Jews in Arab states fled or were forced to leave, with most of them [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|absorbed by Israel]].
* United Nations Security Council issued [[UN Security Council Resolution 242|resolution 242]] that set the framework for a resolution through "[[land for peace]]".
* In 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|peace treaty]], agreeing on international borders between the two states, but leaving the disposition of Gaza for peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
* In 1988, the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]] declared "the establishment of the State of Palestine in the land of Palestine with its capital at Jerusalem."&lt;ref name=doi-un&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Communiqué of the Palestine National Council and Declaration of Independence of 15 November 1988|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6EB54A389E2DA6C6852560DE0070E392|publisher=United Nations General Assembly Security Council|accessdate=11 July 2011|date=18 November 1988|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728142712/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6EB54A389E2DA6C6852560DE0070E392|archivedate=28 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1993, the PLO and Israel signed a [[Oslo Accords|declaration of principles]] that included mutual recognition and the ultimate goal of establishing [[self rule]] for the Palestinian people.
* In 1994, [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace|Jordan and Israel also signed a peace treaty]].
* No other Arab state has granted legal recognition of Israel's sovereignty. A formal state of war still exists between Israel and several Arab states, though [[1949 Armistice Agreements|armistice agreements]] govern interaction between the states.
* Several attempts at finalizing the terms for a peace agreement between Israel and the PLO have failed. In 2006 the Palestinians elected [[Hamas]] into power, a party that does not recognize Israel as legitimate.

==Legal issues related to the wars==
[[Sovereign state]]s have the right to defend themselves against overt external aggression, in the form of an invasion or other attack. A number of states assert that this principle extends to the right to launch military actions to reduce a threat, protect vital interests, or pre-empt a possible attack or emerging threat.

===Wars between Israel and Arab states===
Security Council resolution 242, emphasized "the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war," setting the stage for controversy on the legal status of areas captured in 1967, and in 1948.{{citation needed|reason=1948?|date=April 2016}}

There are two interpretations of this matter:
* The Israeli position is that:
** The wars in [[Suez Crisis|1956]] and [[Six-Day War|1967]] were waged by Israel to ensure the state's survival. As most hostilities were initiated by the Arab side, Israel had to fight and win these wars in order to ensure the state's sovereignty and safety. Territories captured in the course of those wars are therefore legitimately under Israeli administration for both security reasons and to deter hostile states from belligerence.
** In the absence of peace treaties between all the parties at war, Israel has under all circumstances the right to maintain control of the captured territories. Their ultimate disposition should be a result of peace treaties, and not a condition for them.  Even so, Israel asserts that:
*** The [[Suez Crisis|1956 war]] was caused by a pattern of Egyptian belligerence against Israel, culminating with the nationalization of the [[Suez Canal]] and the blockage of the canal for Israeli traffic in violation of the [[Convention of Constantinople]] and other relevant treaties, in their view a clear ''casus belli'' (i.e., an act justifying war)
*** The [[Six-Day War|1967 war]] was similarly caused by the closing of the [[Straits of Tiran]], the rejection of UN forces in the Sinai desert, and the redeployment of Egyptian forces. Jordan and Syria entered the war in spite of Israeli efforts to keep these frontiers peaceful.
*** The [[Yom Kippur War|1973 war]] was a surprise attack against Israel by Syria and Egypt.
* The Arab position is that:
** The 1956 war came after an Israeli attack on the Gaza strip killing 25 Egyptian soldiers, and was a result of a conspiracy between France, the United Kingdom and Israel in violation of Egypt's sovereignty.  Egypt claimed several legal justifications for refusing Israel use of the Suez Canal, including the right of self-defence.
** The war in 1967 was an unprovoked act of aggression aimed at expanding the boundaries of Israel, and the territories captured during this war are illegally occupied.
** As a result, the territories must be ceded in order for peace to be achieved.
As noted above, Israel, Egypt, and Jordan have resolved this impasse and have recognized international borders between these states.  The dispute has now shifted to the conflict between the [[Palestinians]] and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shalim|first=Avi|title=The Iron Wall|year=2000|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-028870-4|pages=117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues related to occupation==
The Geneva Conventions and other international tractates recognize that land a) conquered in the course of a war; and b) the disposition of which is unresolved through subsequent peace treaties is "occupied" and subject to international laws of war and [[international humanitarian law]]. This includes special protection of individuals in those territories, limitations on the use of land in those territories, and access by international relief agencies.

===Jerusalem===
Recognizing the controversial nature of sovereignty over [[Jerusalem]], UNSCOP recommended that the city be placed under United Nations administration in the partition plan. This was approved by the General Assembly in November 1947, accepted by the Jews and rejected by the Arabs. However, the 1948–1949 war resulted in Israel occupying the western portion of the city. Israel made Jerusalem its capital in 1950, establishing governmental offices in areas it controlled. Soon afterward in 1950, Jordan annexed the eastern part along with the remainder of the West Bank.

After the 1967 war, Israel put the parts of Jerusalem that had been captured during the war under its jurisdiction and civilian administration, establishing new municipal borders.  Arguing that this did not amount to annexation at the time, subsequent legal actions have been interpreted as consistent with an annexation.

On July 30, 1980, the [[Knesset]] passed a basic law making "Jerusalem, complete and united…the capital of Israel."  Since then Israel has extended the municipal boundaries several times.

On October 6, 2002, [[Yasser Arafat]] signed the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]]'s law making Al Quds "the eternal capital of Palestine."

International bodies such as the United Nations have condemned Israel's Basic Law concerning Jerusalem as a violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] and therefore hold that the establishment of the city as Israel's capital is against international law. Consequently, countries have established embassies to Israel's government outside of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quigley|first=John B.|title=The Case for Palestine: An International Law Perspective|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaUvqHNd6m0C&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=jerusalem+embassies&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=eQ8NTtLrMdD1sgayvo3_Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=embassies&amp;f=false|accessdate=1  July 2011|pages=93 and 226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, missions to the [[Palestinian National Authority]] are at the insistence of Israel's government located outside of Jerusalem.

Israel has filed strenuous protests [http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/jerusalem%20capital%20of%20israel/] against this policy, asserting that:
* There is no basis in international law for denying Israel's establishing its capital in Jerusalem, because there is no binding treaty that makes the city a [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|Corpus separatum]].
* The 1980 Basic Law is not a legal innovation and only affirms Israel's long-standing position on Jerusalem.
* Israel has the sovereign right to establish its capital at the most meaningful place for its people, and its claim is unique.
* Objections to Jerusalem as Israel's capital are political in nature, and not legal.

In its 2004 advisory opinion on the legality of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]], the [[International Court of Justice]] concluded that the lands captured by Israel in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem, are occupied territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/jul2004/isra-j13.shtml|title=International Court of Justice condemns Israel's wall |date=July 13, 2004 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settlement in territories===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''See related articles [[Israeli settlement]] and [[International law and Israeli settlements]].''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states in paragraph 1, [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/0/6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5?OpenDocument]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and states in paragraph 6,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Arguments supporting the position that establishing, funding, or allowing settlements in the territories is a violation of international law are,
* [[International Committee of the Red Cross|The International Committee of the Red Cross']] commentaries to the Geneva Conventions [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600056?OpenDocument] state that Article 49, paragraph 6, "is intended to prevent a practice adopted during the Second World War by certain Powers, which transferred portions of their own population to occupied territory for political and racial reasons or in order, as they claimed, to colonize those territories." It further notes "that in this paragraph the meaning of the words 'transfer' and 'deport' is rather different from that in which they are used in the other paragraphs of Article 49 since they do not refer to the movement of protected persons but to that of nationals of the occupying Power". &lt;!--It would therefore appear to have been more logical – and this was pointed out at the Diplomatic Conference (14) – to have made the clause in question into a separate provision distinct from Article 49, so that the concepts of "deportations" and "transfers" in that Article could have kept throughout the meaning given them in paragraph 1, i.e. the compulsory movement of protected persons from occupied territory.--&gt;&lt;!--This more than implies another meaning given to "transfers" in this particular paragraph--&gt; The Committee has on several occasions described the establishment of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

* the [[International Court of Justice]], in paragraph 120 of its [[advisory opinion]] on the "Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory", asserts that: "That provision [article 49(6)] prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the occupied territory" and "concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law".

* The Security Council has in [[UN Security Council Resolution 446|Resolution 446]] determined: "that the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity".

Arguments supporting the position that settlement in the territories does not violate international law are,

* Article 49 "cannot be viewed as prohibiting the voluntary return of individuals to the towns and villages from which they, or their ancestors, had been ousted" from living, e.g., in [[Gush Etzion]], Jerusalem, or [[Hebron]] before 1948.

* Jews have a legal right to settle the areas according to the Mandate for Palestine (specifically Article 6 of the mandate concerning Jewish settlements) and to such documents as the [[Faisal Weizmann Agreement]]. The British Mandate (granted by the [[League of Nations]]) specifically encouraged "close settlement by Jews on the land."

==Legal issues related to the Israeli West Bank barrier==
:''See related article [[Israeli West Bank barrier]].''

Israel has completed long stretches of barriers within the West Bank, separating Israel proper, Israeli settlements and large parts of the Palestinian territories from Palestinian cities and population centers.
* Those who question the legality of the barrier make the following arguments:
** The barrier has been found to be illegal by the legal arm of the United Nations (the [[International Court of Justice]]).
** At various locations, the selected route of the barrier required the demolition of homes and the expulsion of the residents of those homes, in violation of Article 49 of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].
** The barrier and Israel's series of checkpoints have made life nearly impossible for residents of the West Bank, constituting [[collective punishment]].  Article 33 of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] categorize collective punishment in occupied territories as a [[war crime]].
** At various locations, the selected route of the barrier required the demolition of Palestinian property, in violation of article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Conventions.
** The barrier is an attempt to establish ''de facto'' borders between Israel and a future Palestinian state, in effect annexing large parts of West Bank and all of East Jerusalem, in violation of numerous United Nations Security Council Resolutions.
** The barrier attempts to separate Palestinians from their means of livelihood and from interaction with others and it, therefore, qualifies as [[Apartheid]].  Apartheid is illegal as per the 2002 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and is considered a [[crime against humanity]] (see also: [[Israel and the apartheid analogy]]).
** The barrier is constructed ''inside'' of the West Bank, making it completely in violation of international law.
** The barrier differs from all other protective barriers built by any other state (such as the Berlin Wall, or the US-Mexico border) in that it is not constructed on the border between states but rather crosses the occupied territories in numerous locations, and with existing/expanding settlements, divides the occupied territories into 4 or 5 [[Canton (country subdivision)|cantons]].
* Israel defends the security barrier by arguing that:
** The barrier and its route are solely security measures that will have no bearing on future peace negotiations.
** The land is not subject to the Geneva Conventions.
** The Geneva Conventions explicitly allows structures to be built for purposes of self-defense.
** The Israeli Supreme Court is reviewing the route on a continuous basis and has forced it to change.
** [[StandWithUs]], a pro-Israel advocacy organization, defends the security fence by pointing out:
*** Israel did not begin building the fence until 2003 when terrorism reached unprecedented levels.
*** The fence is similar to [[Separation barrier|barriers]] that dozens of other [[Democracy|democracies]] have built to keep out terrorists or illegal immigrants, such as the barriers between the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]], [[India]] and [[Kashmir]], [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]], [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]] and even the walls within [[Belfast]] that separate Protestant and Catholic neighborhoods.
*** Since construction of the fence began in 2003, the number of completed terrorist attacks has dropped by more than 90%.
*** 97% of the barrier is a chain-link fence similar to those along the United States's border; only 3% (10 miles) is a concrete wall, built to prevent sniper shooting prevalent in certain areas.
*** Only 5%–8% of the West Bank and less than 1% of Palestinians will end up on the Israeli side of the fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2268|title=Israel's Newly Approved Security Fence Route:|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC04.php?CID=1|title=The West Bank Fence:|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Palestinians can bring their specific grievances about the barrier to [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israel's Supreme Court]], which in several cases has ruled that the fence must be re-routed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Law/Legal+Issues+And+Rulings/High+Court+rules+on+security+fence+around+ALFEI+MENASHE+15-SEP-2005.htm?DMode=print|title=High Court of Justice rules on security fence around Alfei Menashe|work=GxMSDev|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the United Nations passed a number of resolutions and the [[International Court of Justice]] issued a ruling where judges ruled 14–1 that the portions of the Israeli West Bank barrier that are located within occupied Palestinian territories are illegal under international law. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140825085245/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1677.pdf] Prior to the ruling, Israel had made the claim that the ICJ lacked standing to rule on the legality of the barrier, which the court unanimously rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3879057.stm |title=UN rules against Israeli barrier |date=2004-07-09 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 20, 2004, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution demanding that Israel obey the ICJ ruling. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060517152912/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/f3b95e613518a0ac85256eeb00683444?OpenDocument] 150 nations voted in favor of the resolution, 7 voted against, and 10 abstained.

===United Nations===
In October 2003, the [[United States]] vetoed a United Nations [[UN Security Council Resolution|Security Council resolution]], which stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The construction by Israel, the occupying power, of a wall in the Occupied Territories departing from the armistice line of 1949 is illegal under relevant provisions of international law and must be ceased and reversed.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Cameroon]] abstained from the vote. The justification given by the U.S. for the veto was that the resolution did not condemn terrorist attacks made by Palestinian groups (see [[Negroponte doctrine]]). The United States, however, has been condemned by some countries for its support of the barrier.

One week later, on October 21, a similar (though [[non-binding resolution|non-binding]]) resolution (ES-10/13) was passed by the UN General Assembly 144-4 with 12 abstentions. The resolution said the barrier was "in contradiction to international law", and demanded that Israel "stop and reverse" its construction. Israel called the resolution a "farce".

===Process of the ICJ===
In December 2003, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution requesting the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to make a non-binding [[Advisory opinion#International Court of Justice|advisory opinion]] on the "legal consequences arising" from the construction of the barrier.

The hearings began in February 2004. The [[Palestinian Authority]] is not a member of the court but was allowed to make a submission by virtue of being a UN observer and a co-sponsor of the General Assembly resolution. In January 2004, the court also authorized the [[League of Arab States]] and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] to make submissions.

Israel initially announced that it would cooperate with the court, while noting that advisory rulings of the ICJ are not binding. Israel later made a written submission to the court rejecting the authority of the court to rule on the case, but announced (on February 12, 2004) that it would not appear at the court to make oral submissions.

On January 30, 2004, Israel announced officially it did not recognize ICJ authority to rule over the barrier issue. Israel also dispatched a 120-page document, elaborating on the security needs to build the "terror prevention fence" and purporting to demonstrate the atrocities committed by [[Palestinian terrorism|Palestinian terrorists]]. The document also included a judicial part with legal accounts supporting Israel's claim that the issue of the barrier is political and not in the ICJ authority.

On 23, 24, and 25 February 2004 the hearings before the International Court of Justice took place in the [[Peace Palace]] at [[the Hague]].

===Ruling of the ICJ===
[[File:Israeli West Bank barrier watchtower.jpg|thumb|upright|Graffiti on the barrier, reading "Illegal."]]
On July 9, 2004, the International Court of Justice issued its opinion against the barrier, calling for it to be removed and the Arab residents to be compensated for any damage done. The Court advised that the United Nations General Assembly, which had asked for the ruling, and the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] should act on the issue.

A summary of the ruling is as follows:&lt;ref name="icj-cij.org"&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021237/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }}, [[International Court of Justice]] [[Advisory Opinion]], July 9, 2004, paragraph 163.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The construction of the wall by the [[Military occupation|occupying power]] Israel in the [[Palestinian territories|Occupied Palestinian Territory]], including around [[East Jerusalem]] and its regime are "contrary to international law"”.
# Israel is obligated to stop construction of the wall, including around [[East Jerusalem]] and to dismantle the structure, and to repeal all legislative and regulatory acts relating to the wall.
# Israel is obligated to "make [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparation]] for all damages caused" by the wall, including around East Jerusalem”.
# All states are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal wall and "not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation", and to "ensure compliance by Israel with [[international humanitarian law]]" in accordance with the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] relating to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949, while "respecting the [[United Nations Charter]] and international law, as embodied in that convention”".
# The [[United Nations General Assembly]] and the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] should consider what further action is required to bring to an end the illegal wall and the associated regime.”

The opinion was passed 14-1 by the court judges, except for the 4th decision which was passed 13–2.

[[Thomas Buergenthal]], the American judge, was the sole dissenting member of the 15 judges on this ICJ panel. In his declaration, he stated that there was much in the court's opinion with which he agreed but that the court should have declined to hear the case since it did not have before it "relevant facts bearing directly on issues of Israel's legitimate right of self-defense". He stated that his dissenting opinion "should not be seen as reflecting my view that the construction of the wall by Israel on the Occupied Palestinian Territory does not raise serious questions as a matter of international law." On the point of portions of the wall that were being built beyond the green line, which Israel stated were to defend settlements, Buergenthal stated:&lt;ref name="icj-cij.org" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Paragraph 6 of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention also does not admit exceptions on grounds of military or security exigencies. It provides that "the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies". I agree that this provision applies to the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and that their existence violates Article 49, paragraph 6. It follows that the segments of the wall being built by Israel to protect the settlements are ''[[ipso facto]]'' in violation of international humanitarian law. Moreover, given the demonstrable great hardship to which the affected Palestinian population is being subjected in and around the enclaves created by those segments of the wall, seriously doubt that the wall would here satisfy the proportionality requirement to qualify as a legitimate measure of self-defence.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reaction to the ICJ===
The opinion was accepted by the United Nations General Assembly,&lt;ref name="Dugard2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Dugard|title=International Law: A South African Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9PFcjzhFcYC&amp;pg=PA477|accessdate=3 May 2013|date=30 June 2006|publisher=Kluwer|isbn=978-0-7021-7121-5|page=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; on July 20, 2004, it passed a resolution demanding that Israel obey the ICJ ruling. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060517152912/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/f3b95e613518a0ac85256eeb00683444?OpenDocument] Israel, the US, [[Australia]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and [[Palau]] voted against the resolution, 10 nations abstained, and 150 nations voted in favor.

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said: "This is an excellent decision. This is a victory for the Palestinian people and for all the free peoples of the world."

Israel rejected the ICJ ruling and emphasized the barrier's self-defense aspect [http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/about%20the%20ministry/mfa%20spokesman/2004/Statement%20on%20ICJ%20Advisory%20Opinion%209-July-2004], and stressed that Israel will continue to build the barrier. The United States also rejected the ruling, declaring that the issue was of political rather than legal nature. [[Colin Powell]] stated that barrier was effective against terror, and noted that the ICJ ruling was not binding, but insisted that Israel not use the barrier to predetermine permanent borders. [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/449648.html]

Numerous human rights organizations welcomed the ICJ ruling. [[Amnesty International]] said that Israel should immediately cease constructing the barrier. The governments of Israel's neighbors [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Egypt]] also welcomed the ruling.

On July 13, 2004, the US House of Representatives passed Resolution HR 713 deploring "the misuse of the International Court of Justice (ICJ)... for the narrow political purpose of advancing the Palestinian position on matters Palestinian authorities have said should be the subject of negotiations between the parties." [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:H.RES.713:] The Resolution further stated that twenty-three countries, including every member of the [[G8]] and several other European states, had "submitted objections on various grounds against the ICJ hearing the case."

==Legal issues related to refugees==

===Legal definition of refugee===
The tractate that is most often invoked for legally defining [[refugee]]s is the 1951 [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]]. The definition of "refugee" is most often summarized as
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''... a person who is outside his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a well-founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of persecution.'' The convention is administered by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] (UNRWA), which was established prior to the 1951 convention in response to the humanitarian crisis, applies a different definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Under UNRWA's operational definition, Palestine refugees are persons whose normal place of residence was Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict. UNRWA's services are available to all those living in its area of operations who meet this definition, who are registered with the Agency and who need assistance. UNRWA's definition of a refugee also covers the descendants of persons who became refugees in 1948.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the definition used by UNRWA was originally made on an operational basis rather than dictated by specific international law, obligations and rights related to Palestinian refugees under international law are a matter of some debate.  The debate centers on questions such as: whether the status of refugees can properly be passed through inheritance to individuals who have never lived in the vacated areas, and whether individuals who have repatriated in other countries can legally claim refugee status.

Palestinian refugees were excluded from the 1951 Convention due to the clause that "This Convention shall not apply to persons who are at present receiving from organs or agencies of the United Nations other than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees protection or assistance." As [https://web.archive.org/web/20050411161104/http://www.badil.org/Publications/Other/UNHCR-1D-Handbook92.htm interpreted] by UNHCR, this caused some anomalies, since UNRWA admits some persons as refugees that are not automatically admitted by the Convention, and, conversely, some of the legal protections given to refugees by the Convention were not available to most Palestinians. In 2002, UNHCR adopted a revised interpretation that fills some of these gaps. The BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights published a critical analysis of UNHCR revised interpretation of the 1951 Refugee Convention.&lt;ref name=badilnov2002&gt;{{cite web|title=A Critical Analysis of the Revised UNHCR Interpretation|publisher=BADIL|accessdate=11 July 2011|url=http://www.badil.org/en/component/k2/item/994-refugee-protection |date=November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
An [[ossuary]] is a stone (usually [[limestone]]) depository for storing bones of the dead, considered a luxury for the elite. The dead would lie on a [[loculus (architecture)|loculus]] in a tomb for a year of decomposition, and then the remains would be collected and placed in an ossuary. Depending on the wealth and taste of the family, the box would sometimes be inscribed with decorations or the name of the deceased.{{sfn|Byrne|McNary-Zak|2009|pp=4–6}} The James Ossuary measures {{convert|50.5 x 25 x 30.5|cm|in}}, which is slightly smaller for than other ossuaries of the time.{{sfn|Byrne|McNary-Zak|2009|p=21}} If the inscription on the James Ossuary is genuine, the inscription may indicate that the ossuary was that of [[James the Just]], the brother of [[Jesus]], the founder of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

Professor Camil Fuchs of [[Tel Aviv University]] stated that, other than James Ossuary, only one has been found so far in thousands of ossuaries, which contains a reference to a brother, concluding that "there is little doubt that this [naming a brother or son] was done only when there was a very meaningful reason to refer to a family member of the deceased, usually due to his importance and fame." He produced a statistical analysis of the occurrence of these three names in ancient Jerusalem and projected that there were 1.71 people named James, with a father named Joseph and a brother named Jesus, living in Jerusalem around the time at which the ossuary was produced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Announcement and exhibition==
The existence of the James Ossuary was announced at a press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]], on October 21, 2002. It was organized by [[Hershel Shanks]], founder of the [[Biblical Archaeology Society]]. He presented it as the first direct archaeological link to the [[historical Jesus]].{{sfn|Byrne|McNary-Zak|2009|p=6}}

Shanks also announced that the ossuary would be featured at an exhibit at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] in [[Toronto]], Canada, opening the following month. The opening was to coincide with meetings of scholarly groups like the [[Society of Biblical Literature]] and [[American Academy of Religion]] that were to take place in the city in November.{{sfn|Byrne|McNary-Zak|2009|p=7}}

==Scholarly analysis==
The James Ossuary came from the [[Silwan]] area in the [[Kidron Valley]], southeast of the [[Temple Mount]]. The bones originally inside the ossuary had been discarded, which is the case in nearly all ossuaries not discovered by archaeologists. The first-century origin of the ossuary is not in question, since the only time Jews buried in that fashion was from approximately 20 BC to the [[destruction of Jerusalem]] in 70 AD. The dispute centres on the date of origin of the inscription.

According to [[André Lemaire]], the Parisian epigrapher initially invited by antiquities dealer [[Oded Golan]] to view the ossuary in Golan's apartment, the cursive Aramaic script is consistent with first-century lettering. He determined that the inscription was not incised with modern tools, as it contains no elements not available in the ancient world.&lt;ref name="James D. Tabor 2006. pp 6-36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The James Ossuary"&gt;Paul L. Maier, [http://www.mtio.com/articles/bissar95.htm ''The James Ossuary''] Lutheran Witness, 2003. p 1&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the inscription, "James son of Joseph," seems more deeply incised than the latter "brother of Jesus." This may be due to the inscription being made at a different time, or due to differences in the hardness of the limestone.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The fragile condition of the ossuary attests to its antiquity. The Israel Geological Survey submitted the ossuary to a variety of scientific tests, which determined that the limestone of the ossuary had a [[patina]] or sheen consistent with being in a cave for many centuries. The same type of patina covers the incised lettering of the inscription as the rest of the surface. It is claimed that if the inscription were recent, this would not be the case.&lt;ref name="Jesus and the Ossuaries: What Jewish Burial Practices Reveal about the Beginning of Christianity"&gt;Craig A. Evans, [http://www.baylorpress.com/en/Book/146/Jesus_and_the_Ossuaries.html ''Jesus and the Ossuaries''] Baylor University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2016}}

On June 18, 2003 the Israeli Antiquities Authority (IAA) published a report concluding that the inscription is a modern forgery based on their analysis of the patina. Specifically, it claimed that the inscription was added in modern times and made to look old by addition of a chalk solution. In 2006, Wolfgang Elisabeth Krumbein, a world's renowned expert in stone patinas called by the defense counsel, analyzed the ossuary, and concluded that "the inscription is ancient and most of the original patina has been removed (by cleaning or use of sharp implement)".&lt;ref name="KrumbeinReport"&gt;Wolfgang E. Krumbein, ''[http://www.forananswer.org/Top_General/James_Ossuary_Report.pdf Preliminary Report: External Expert Opinion on three Stone Items]'', Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He further noted in his report, "any forgery of three very distinct types of patina, if ever possible, requires the development of ultra-advanced techniques, in-depth knowledge and extensive collaboration of a large number of experts from various fields".&lt;ref name="KrumbeinReport" /&gt; According to his analysis, the patina inside the inscription took at least 50 years to form; thus, if it is a forgery, then it was forged more than 50 years ago.&lt;ref name="KrumbeinBombshell"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Krumbeins-bombshell|title=Krumbein's bombshell|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, an analysis of the ossuary's [[Petrography]] and oxygen isotopic composition was conducted by Avner Ayalon, Miryam Bar-Matthews and Yuval Goren. They compared the [[Δ18O|''δ''&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] values of the letters patina from the James Ossuary, with the patina sampled from the uninscribed surfaces of the same item ("surface patina"), and with surface and letters patinas from legally excavated ossuaries from Jerusalem. Their study undermined the authenticity contention of the ossuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|title=Authenticity examination of the inscription on the ossuary attributed to James, brother of Jesus|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1185–1189|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2004.03.001|author=Ayalon, A., Bar-Matthews, M., &amp; Goren, Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/Harrell/ Dr James Harrell], professor of Archaeological Geology at the University of Toledo, provided an explanation for this ''δ''&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O discrepancy.  He suggested that a cleanser may have been the source of the low ''δ''&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O readings, which antiquities dealers and collectors often use to clean the artifacts to increase value.  He tested the most popular cleanser sold in Israel and confirmed that the ''δ''&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O value of the cleanser was consistent with the ''δ''&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O value of the patina in the inscription.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/education/resources/highschool/chemmatters/articlesbytopic/atomictheory/chemmatters-feb2006-ossuary.pdf|title=Real or Fake?

A later study done with a different isotope found that the [[Δ13C|''δ''&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] values of the surface patina and the inscription patina were almost identical.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 2007 Finnish [[theologian]] Matti Myllykoski (Arto Matti Tuomas Myllykoski) summarised the current position thus: "The authenticity and significance of the ossuary has been defended by Shanks (2003), while some scholars—relying on convincing evidence, to say the least—strongly suspect that it is a modern forgery."&lt;ref&gt;Myllykoski, Matti (2007), "James the Just in History and Tradition: Perspectives of Past and Present Scholarship (Part II)," ''[[Currents in Biblical Research]]'' 6:11, p.84, {{doi|10.1177/1476993X07080242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dockser Marcus|first=Amy|title=Ancient Objects, Dubious Claims|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122446027022248721|date=20 October 2008|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=28 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923161841/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122446027022248721|archive-date=23 September 2015|dead-url=no|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an archaeometric analysis conducted by [http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/archaeology-today/archaeologists-biblical-scholars-works/amnon-rosenfeld-1944-2014/ Amnon Rosenfeld], [http://www.amnh.org/our-research/staff-directory/dr.-howard-r.-feldman Howard Randall Feldman], and [https://mitpress.mit.edu/authors/wolfgang-e-krumbein Wolfgang Elisabeth Krumbein] strengthened the authenticity contention of the ossuary. It found that patina on the ossuary surface matched that in the engravings, and that [[microfossils]] in the inscription seemed naturally deposited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2008AM/finalprogram/abstract_139934.htm|title=Archaeometric Analysis of the James Ossuary|website=gsa.confex.com|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli investigation==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
[[Image:JamesOssuaryInscription-1-.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Close-up of the Aramaic inscription: "Ya'akov bar Yosef akhui di Yeshua" ("James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus")]]
[[Limor Livnat]], Israeli Minister of Culture, mandated the work of a scientific commission to study the suspicious finds. IAA began an investigation into the affair. The James Ossuary was authentic—albeit unusual in shape—but they claimed the inscription was a fake.

However, in an external [[expert report]], dated September 2005, Wolfgang E. Krumbein entered the controversy. His conclusions contradict those of the IAA stating "Our preliminary investigations cannot prove the authenticity of the three objects beyond any doubt. Doubtlessly the patina is continuous in many places throughout surface and lettering grooves in the case of ossuary and tablet. On the other hand a proof of forgery is not given by the experts nominated by the IAA."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib-arch.org/bswbOOossuary_krumbeinsummary.asp Biblical Archaeology Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206120932/http://www.bib-arch.org/bswbOOossuary_Krumbeinsummary.asp |date=2006-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli Antiquities Authority has failed to offer any report explaining why it concluded the ossuary is a forgery. Unsurprisingly, international experts are unable to give their opinions on the ossuary's authenticity until the IAA allows scholars to review its findings.

Edward John Keall, the Senior Curator at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] (ROM), Near Eastern &amp; Asian Civilizations Department, continues to argue for the ossuary’s authenticity, saying "the ROM has always been open to questioning the ossuary's authenticity, but so far no definitive proof of forgery has yet been presented, in spite of the current claims being made."&lt;ref name="rom.on.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/news/releases/public.php?mediakey=vhggdo3048|title=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' also continued to defend the ossuary. In articles in the February 2005 issues, several paleographic experts argue that the James Ossuary is authentic and should be examined by specialists outside of Israel. Another article claims the cleaning of the James Ossuary before it was examined may have caused the problem with the patina.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt; On June 13, 2012 a ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' press release announced the first major post-trial analysis of the ossuary, discussing the plausibility of its authenticity and using statistical analysis of ancient names to suggest that in contemporary Jerusalem, there would be 1.71 people named James with a father Joseph and a brother named Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/news/%E2%80%9Cbrother-of-jesus%E2%80%9D-proved-ancient-and-authentic/ Biblical Archaeology Society | Press Release: "Brother of Jesus" Proved Ancient and Authentic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616224241/http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/news/%E2%80%9Cbrother-of-jesus%E2%80%9D-proved-ancient-and-authentic/ |date=2012-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial of Oded Golan==
Oded Golan claimed publicly to believe his finds were genuine. [[Hershel Shanks]] declared that he did not believe the evidence of forgery and launched a personal complaint against IAA director Shuka Dorfman. Lemaire supported his original assessment when Frank Cross regretted Shanks' attitude. The Royal Ontario Museum, in its statement about Oded Golan's arrest and the validity of the so-called James Ossuary stated, "There is always a question of authenticity when objects do not come from a controlled archaeological excavation, as is the case with the James Ossuary."&lt;ref name="rom.on.ca"/&gt; However, the museum's decision to rush the ossuary into an exhibition was criticized by scholars. [[Eric M. Meyers]] called the ROM "reckless", and [[Joe Zias]] said, "They saw the opportunity to make a fast buck and they did it."&lt;ref name="Gatehouse"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Gatehouse|first=Jonathon|title=Cashbox|url=http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/religion/article.jsp?content=20050328_102756_102756|date=25 March 2005|magazine=[[Maclean's]]|publisher=[[Rogers Media]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211124100/http://www.macleans.ca:80/topstories/religion/article.jsp?content=20050328_102756_102756|archive-date=11 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israel Antiquities Authority desires to limit the trade in Bible-era artifacts, which they believe encourages grave robbers, who smuggle the choicest finds out of the country.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalman"/&gt;

On 29 December 2004, the Israeli Justice Ministry charged Golan, three other Israelis, and one Palestinian, with running a forgery ring that had been operating for more than twenty years. Golan was indicted in an Israeli court along with his three co-defendants: Robert Deutsch, an epigraphy expert who has given lectures at the [[University of Haifa]]; collector Shlomo Cohen; and antiquities dealer Faiz al-Amaleh. They were accused of manufacturing numerous artifacts, including an [[Ivory pomegranate]] which had previously been generally accepted as the only proven relic from the Temple of King [[Solomon]]. Golan denied the charges.

In February, 2007, at Golan's trial, the defense produced photographs taken in Golan's home that were dated to 1976. In these photographs, the ossuary is shown on a shelf. In an enlargement, the whole inscription can be seen. The photographs were printed on 1970s photographic paper and stamped March 1976. The photo was examined by Gerald Richard, a former FBI agent and an expert for the defense. Richard testified that nothing about the photographs suggested that they were produced other than in 1976 as the stamps and paper indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/collector-accused-of-forging-james-ossuary-says-old-photos-prove-authenticity-1.212297|title=Collector accused of forging 'James ossuary' says old photos prove authenticity|website=haaretz.com|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These photographs undermined the prosecution's theory that the ossuary was a recent forgery by Golan intended to be sold for profit. Golan's attorney, Lior Beringer argued, "The prosecution claims that Golan forged the inscription after the beginning of 2000, however, there is a detailed report from an FBI photo lab that states that the inscription existed at least since the 70s. It is unreasonable that someone would forge an inscription like this in the 70s and suddenly decide to come out with it in 2002." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/823215.html|title=Collector accused of forging 'James ossuary' says old photos prove authenticity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it would also be necessary for some time to pass for a forgery to acquire the characteristics of an authentic patina. Later under oath, the government's chief scientific witness, Professor Yuval Goren of Tel Aviv University admitted on cross-examination that there was original ancient patina in the word "Jesus."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|author=Biblical Archaeology Society |date=13 June 2012 |title='Brother of Jesus' Proved Ancient and Authentic |work=Bible History Daily |url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/news/"brother-of-jesus"-proved-ancient-and-authentic/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831042728/http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/news/%E2%80%9Cbrother-of-jesus%E2%80%9D-proved-ancient-and-authentic/ |archivedate=31 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two paleographers, [[André Lemaire]] of the Sorbonne and [[Ada Yardeni]] of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, pronounced it as authentic in the trial. No paleographer of repute has challenged their analysis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In fact, Yardeni, who is considered a household name in the field, testified that the inscription is no doubt of ancient origin inscribed by a single individual, and stated, "If this is a forgery, I quit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://popular-archaeology.com/issue/summer-2016/article/ancient-james-ossuary-and-jehoash-tablet-inscriptions-may-be-authentic-say-experts|title=Ancient James Ossuary and Jehoash Tablet Inscriptions May Be Authentic, Say Experts|newspaper=Popular Archeology|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;   By 2009, many of the world's top archaeological experts had testified for both the prosecution and defense. Judge Aharon Farkash, who has a degree in archaeology, indicated difficulty in making a judgment regarding the objects' authenticity if the professors could not agree amongst themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1920720,00.html |work=Time |title=The Burial Box of Jesus' Brother: Fraud? |date=2009-09-05 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second week of October 2010, the judge in the case against Golan and others retired to consider his verdict.

On March 14, 2012, Jerusalem Judge Aharon Farkash stated "that there is no evidence that any of the major artifacts were forged, and that the prosecution failed to prove their accusations beyond a reasonable doubt."&lt;ref name="biblicalarchaeology.org"/&gt; He was particularly scathing about tests carried out by the Israel police forensics laboratory that he said had probably contaminated the ossuary, making it impossible to carry out further scientific tests on the inscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/antiquities-collector-acquitted-of-forgery-charges-in-james-ossuary-case/article2368752/ |location=Toronto |work=The Globe and Mail |title=Search |date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 30, 2012, Oded Golan was fined 30,000 shekels and sentenced to one month in jail for minor non-forgery charges related to the trial.

==Discovery Channel documentaries==
{{main|The Lost Tomb of Jesus}}
On February 26, 2007 a news conference was held at the New York Public Library by director [[James Cameron]] and [[Simcha Jacobovici]] to discuss their documentary ''[[The Lost Tomb of Jesus]]'', which discusses the 1980 finding of the [[Talpiot Tomb]], which they claim is in fact Jesus' family tomb. In the film, they also suggest that the so-called James ossuary is actually the "missing link" from the tomb (at the original discovery of the Talpiot Tomb, there were ten ossuaries, however one has since been lost—Jacobovici suggests the James Ossuary could be the tenth from Talpiot). According to the film, "recent tests conducted at the CSI Suffolk Crime lab in New York demonstrate that the patina (a chemical film encrustation on the box) from the James ossuary matches the patina from the other ossuaries in the Talpiot tomb."

Following the 4 March 2007 airing of ''[[The Lost Tomb of Jesus]]'' on the Discovery Channel, [[Ted Koppel]] aired a program entitled ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus: A Critical Look'', whose guests included the director Simcha Jacobovici, James Tabor (a consultant and advisor on the docudrama), Johnathan Reed, Professor of Religion at the University of LaVerne and co-author of ''Excavating Jesus Beneath the Stones, Behind the Text'', and William Dever, an archaeologist with 40 plus years experience in Middle Eastern archaeological digs.

''The Washington Post'' in an article of 28 February 2007 quotes Dever as saying, "I just think it's a shame the way this story is being hyped and manipulated" and "all of the names [contained in the tomb] are common."&lt;ref name="Cooperman 2007"&gt;Alan Cooperman, "'Lost Tomb of Jesus' Claim Called a Stunt; Archaeologists Decry TV Film," ''[[The Washington Post]]'', page A3, February 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, two of the names found in the tomb are unique among known ossuaries,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} and Jacobovici's argument does not in any case rely on the commonness or uncommonness of individual names, but on the statistical probability of finding a set of names in a single tomb.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Alan Cooperman, writer of the ''Washington Post'' article also states:
:"Similar assessments came yesterday from two Israeli scholars, [[Amos Kloner]], who originally excavated the tomb, and [[Joe Zias]], former curator of archaeology at the Israeli Antiquities Authority.  Kloner told the Jerusalem Post that the documentary is "nonsense." Zias described it in an e-mail to The Washington Post as a "hyped up film which is intellectually and scientifically dishonest."&lt;ref name="Cooperman 2007"/&gt;

In the docudrama ''[[The Lost Tomb of Jesus]]'', Simcha Jacobovici claims:
# concerning the ossuary marked Jesus and the one believed to be that of Mary Magdalene: because "the DNA did not match, the forensic archaeologist concluded that they must be husband and wife";
# that testing showed that there was a match between the patina on the James and Jesus ossuaries and refers to the James ossuary as a possible "missing link" from the tomb of Jesus;
# and that an ossuary that became missing from the tomb of Jesus had actually been the infamous James ossuary.

During Ted Koppel's critique, ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus: A Critical Look'', Koppel stated he had denials from three people Simcha Jacobovici had misquoted in the documentary.
# Koppel had a written denial from the forensic archaeologist asserting that he had not concluded that the remains of Jesus and Miriamne showed they were husband and wife.
# Koppel had a written denial from the Suffolk Crime Lab Director asserting that he had not stated the James ossuary patina "matched" that of the Jesus ossuary.  Jacobovici had a written denial of Koppel's written denial saying that the term "match" had a legal meaning that could not be applied to the patina tests; however, the patinas corresponded closely enough to meet an evidentiary standard of admissibility.
# Koppel had a verbal denial from Professor Amos Kloner, the archaeologist who had supervised the initial 1980 dig of the tomb of Jesus, with whom he spoke on 4 March 2007, asserting that the ossuary that later turned up missing from the tomb could not have been what is now known as the James ossuary because the ossuary he had seen and photographed and catalogued in 1980 had been totally unmarked, whereas the James ossuary is marked with the name of James and a rosette.

Additionally, Simcha Jacobovici's association of the ossuary with the 'Tomb of Jesus' seems to be excluded by the 1976 photograph of the ossuary presented at trial. The assertions of ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' are not supported by the overwhelming majority of scholars.

'''Juan Francisco Masdeu''' (4 October 1744 – 1817), [[Spain|Spanish]] historian, was born at [[Palermo]]. He joined the [[Company of Jesus]] on 19 December 1759 and became professor in the [[Jesuit]] seminaries at [[Ferrara]] and [[Ascoli Piceno|Ascoli]]. He visited Spain in 1799, was exiled, and returned in 1815, dying at [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] on 11 April 1817.

His ''Storia critica di Spagne e della cultura spagnuola in ogni genere'' (2 vols., 1781–1784) was finally expanded into the ''Historia crítica de España y de la cultura española'' (1783–1805), which, though it consists of twenty volumes, was left [[unfinished work|unfinished]]; had it been continued on the same scale, the work would have consisted of fifty volumes. Masdeu wrote in a critical spirit and with a regard for accuracy rare in his time; but he is more concerned with small details than with the philosophy of history. Still, his narrative is lucid, and later researches have not yet rendered his work obsolete.

'''Jörg Friedrich''' (sometimes spelt Joerg or Jorg in English) (born 17 August 1944 in [[Kitzbühel]]) is a German author and historian. Friedrich is best known for his publication ''Der Brand'' (2002), in which he portrays the Allied bombing of civilian targets during World War II as systematic and in many ways pointless mass murder. An English translation, ''The Fire'', was published in 2006 by [[Columbia University Press]] and met with widespread critical approval. For example, the ''New York Times'' said it "describes in stark, unrelenting and very literary detail what happened in city after city as the Allies dropped 80 million incendiary bombs on Germany..... There is... an edginess to Friedrich's writing and commentary, an emotional power."

Friedrich was formerly considered a [[left-wing]] [[antiwar]] activist and described as a student [[Trotskyist]].&lt;ref name="buruma"&gt;''[https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,847665,00.html Germany's unmourned victims]'' [[Ian Buruma]], [[The Guardian]], 26 November 2002 retrieved 13 January 2005 from https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,847665,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; His books have sold hundreds of thousands of copies in Germany, and some have also been translated into English, Dutch, French and many other languages. He is well connected in German political and military circles and is a friend of former German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]. He has published interviews with [[Rudolf Bahro]] and [[Raul Hilberg]] when their books were published. His new book "14/18 Der Weg nach Versailles" focusses on the First World War.

For his work ''The Law of War: The German Army in Russia'' Friedrich has been awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] by the [[University of Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-13380-7/the-fire&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Born in [[Kitzbühel]] in 1944, he spent his childhood in [[Essen]]. Jörg Friedrich became a Trotskyist and, during the [[Vietnam war]], an antiwar protester. Following thereon, he began to write books on the history of the war in Germany and work as an independent historian, researching postwar justice and the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. His books have always been controversial and have largely sold through this controversial analysis and the publicity surrounding them.

==Criticism of Friedrich's position==
As a historian who has written strongly on the horrors committed by the German state under the [[Nazism|Nazis]], Friedrich's position has always been assumed to be anti-Nazi with antiwar tendencies focused towards Germany's taking responsibility for its actions during the war.

:''"his previous work examining Wehrmacht crimes and Nazi justice enables him to approach the subject without risking automatic dismissal as a right-wing apologist."'' (from the Peifer review of Der Brand)&lt;ref name="peifer"&gt;[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/reviewsw159.htm "Review: Der Brand: Deutschland im Bombenkrieg, 1940/1945"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310082103/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/GENOCIDE/reviewsw159.htm |date=2005-03-10 }}, Douglas Peifer, Air Command and Staff College, ''Air and Space Power Chronicles'', Spring 2004, p121/124 retrieved from http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj04/spr04/spr04.pdf (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich admits that Germany initiated bombing of civilians in the UK by bombing London, although he claims the first raid was accidental, thereby leaving Britain as the first nation to deliberately bomb nonmilitary targets. This entirely ignores the German bombing of English cities during the First World War, using Zeppelin and other rigid airships.  During the Spanish civil war, German airplanes bombed the town of Guernica in April 1937, which had no military use or value.

Less well-known bombings, such as that of the Polish town of [[Wieluń]] within the first two hours of the war and prior to any attack on Germany, either by air or land, are left out. Friedrich mentions the British use of explosive weapons followed by incendiary, a mixture designed to create large fires. He also mentions that the technique to create firestorms was a German development first seen in the bombing against British cities, such as  the [[Coventry Blitz]] (14 November 1940) and [[the Second Great Fire of London]] (29/30 December 1940).

Friedrich was persuaded to publish his book of Dresden photographs by Former German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]];,&lt;ref name="Furlong2"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3211690.stm "Horrific fire-bombing images published"], Ray Furlong, [[BBC News]], 22 October 2003, retrieved 2 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; with the condition that equivalent photographs of [[Poland|Polish]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] victims should also be shown.

Friedrich has specifically attempted to claim the position of an [[objective historian]],&lt;ref name="bernstein"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/15/international/europe/15DRES.html "Germans Revisit War's Agony, Ending a Taboo"], Richard Bernstein, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 15 March 2003 retrieved 11 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; making ''no judgement about the morality of Allied bombing''.&lt;ref name="swanson"&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0303070303mar07,1,20636.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true "Foes of war find ally in book on WWII air raids"]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}'', Stevenson Swanson, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 7 March 2003, retrieved 16 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[#Reviews|reviews]] of his books have pointed out that the language Friedrich uses in his books, with words such as "[[Einsatzgruppen]]" (task force in English) used to describe allied pilots and "crematoria" (as in the crematoria of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]) to describe the air raid shelters in which Dresden residents died.  This has led to accusations that Friedrich ''"is downright reckless"'' and is attempting to make the reader consider a parallel to ''"the Nazi dehumanisation of the Jews."''.&lt;ref name="bamforth"&gt;[http://www.quadrant.org.au/php/archive_details_list.php?article_id=592 ''Air War,Literature and Compassion''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050108232950/http://quadrant.org.au/php/archive_details_list.php?article_id=592 |date=2005-01-08 }},  Iain Bamforth, ''[http://www.quadrant.org.au Quadrant]'', Volume XLVIII Number 1 - January–February 2004, Retrieved 21 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together, two explanations have been given for Friedrich's recent books and their choice of topics. The first is that Friedrich maintains strong antiwar feelings, and with the looming [[War in Iraq]] and other global conflicts, Friedrich wanted to join in the general German antiwar feelings and implicitly criticise the policy of attacks on foreign nonmilitary targets in Iraq. Friedrich has himself rejected this explanation, stating that he "is dismayed that "The Fire" has bolstered the pacifist argument against German participation in an Iraq war".&lt;ref name="swanson2"&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0303070303mar07,1,20636.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true "Foes of war find ally in book on WWII air raids"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', Stevenson Swanson, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 7 March 2003, retrieved 16 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The second explanation that has been given is that Friedrich, whilst probably still anti-Nazi, has been acting as a German [[nationalist]] and trying to put into a reasonable perspective the crimes of some German officials in World War II as not different from, or not even worse than, the many atrocities committed by the other nations involved in the war.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Other related historians==
Other German historians closer to the mainstream of historical research have also covered the suffering of the German people during the war. The bombing of Dresden had been covered in detail by [[Götz Bergander]] prior to Friedrich's book.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2&gt;''Germans Revisit War's Agony, Ending a Taboo'', [[Richard Bernstein]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 15 March 2003, the book referred to is ''Dresden im Luftkrieg: Vorgeschichte, Zerstörung, Folgen'', by Götz Bergander, 1994, {{ISBN|3-412-10193-1}}, in German; apparently no English translation is available.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich has cooperated with historians from various countries, including Peter Maguire, during the creation of his book "Land and War".{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Influence on German and international debate on the war==
&lt;!-- something about Nuremberg books?? --&gt;

Friedrich's books have not been well received by some media outlets in Germany. [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], a public television channel, wrote off ''"the Fire"'' (''"Der Brand"'') as a "provocation",&lt;ref name=Furlong2/&gt; and ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' recommended throwing his latest book, ''Places of Fire'', directly into the garbage bin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harding|first=Luke|title=Germany's forgotten victims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/22/worlddispatch.germany|accessdate=19 January 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with these strong criticisms, Friedrich has had considerable public success. ''Der Brand'' was serialised in the German tabloid ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]]'' and has had a serious influence on German national debate. Friedrich has claimed that this has meant that German civilians who had never previously talked about their wartime experiences have begun to tell about this phase in history, which was previously documented primarily from the point of view of influence on the war. At other times, revision of the outlook on the war has taken place, with [[Klaus Naumann]], a former [[NATO]] General and friend of Friedrich's, saying, during a joint promotional interview with Friedrich, that he now doubted the legality and military need for Churchill's decision to attack Dresden, thereby implying that the attacks were war crimes.&lt;ref name=Cayman&gt;[http://www.caymannetnews.com/Archive/Archive%20Articles/December%202002/Issue%20%20310%20Tue/Retired%20German.html Retired German NATO general stirs Churchill war strategy debate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040815135011/http://www.caymannetnews.com/Archive/Archive%20Articles/December%202002/Issue%20%20310%20Tue/Retired%20German.html |date=2004-08-15 }}, Cayman Net News Online,  2002/12, Retrieved 9 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tagesspiegel&gt;[http://archiv.tagesspiegel.de/archiv/23.12.2002/361552.asp Gibt es den gerechten Luftkrieg?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030509092615/http://archiv.tagesspiegel.de/archiv/23.12.2002/361552.asp |date=2003-05-09 }} (German language), Interview of Friederich and Naumann Kai Müller and Christian Schröder, ''[[Tagesspiegel]]'', 2002/12/23, Retrieved 15 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Both in Germany and abroad, [[neo-Nazi]] groups have seized on the book as proving that the air war was begun by the UK. Claims that the book shows that bombings of German towns in 1940 were the first attacks on civilians of the war, based on the omission of attacks in [[Poland]], are common. The equating of the bombing of Dresden with the Holocaust is made explicit and even inverted (?), with the actions towards Jews described as a decision of Hitler for strategic reasons whilst the needless incineration of hundreds of thousands of defenseless German civilians is reappraised as a war crime and a massacre.

It was not until 15 May 1940, two days after the [[Rotterdam Blitz#Result|Rotterdam Blitz]], that the British abandoned their policy of using aerial bombing only against military targets and against infrastructure, such as ports and railways west of the Rhine, which were of direct military importance. It is also alleged that Rotterdam was bombed by mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Frederick.  ''Dresden: Tuesday, February 13, 1945'' London: Bloomsbury, {{ISBN|0-7475-7078-7}}.

==Reviews==
Due to the level of controversy it has raised, a number of reviews of the German edition of "Der Brand" have been written in English and published in English language journals and/or made available on the Internet.  These reviews, made shortly after the publication of the book and prior to Friedrich's public statements, have tended to treat the inaccuracies and omissions in Friedrich's books as carelessness, although criticism of the language used has been almost universal.

Comparison of reviews made in Germany with those in the [[United States|U.S.]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] is also interesting. Some of the differences may be seen as being due to different points of view; however, specific aspects of the book (for example, the most commonly mentioned failure to provide context) are reliably mentioned in English language reviews whilst being included strongly in some German reviews and missing entirely in others.

* ''Review: Der Brand: Deutschland im Bombenkrieg, 1940-1945'', Douglas Peifer, ''Air and Space Power Chronicles'', Spring 2004&lt;ref name=Peifer2&gt;[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/reviewsw159.htm "Review: Der Brand: Deutschland im Bombenkrieg, 1940/1945"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310082103/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/GENOCIDE/reviewsw159.htm |date=2005-03-10 }} Douglas Peifer, Air Command and Staff College, ''Air and Space Power Chronicles'', Spring 2004, p121/124&lt;/ref&gt;
:Peifer provides a detailed review of the book, which finds that it is ''"Highly effective as a literary dirge and lamentation, it comes up short when judged by the standards of the history discipline"''.  Perhaps more importantly he states that the language is ''"deliberately provocative"'', that the book's unclear chronology can be misleading and that the lack of clear references included makes it unverifiable.  Even given these flaws, Fifer finds that ''"for those willing to make the effort, reading the piece is worthwhile"''.

* ''Review of Jörg Friedrich, Der Brand. Deutschland im Bombenkrieg 1940-1945; A Narrative of Loss'', Joerg Arnold, Department of History, University of Southampton,&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=280291070845163 "Review of Jörg Friedrich, Der Brand. Deutschland im Bombenkrieg 1940/1945; A Narrative of Loss"], Joerg Arnold, Department of History, University of Southampton, retrieved 5 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
:Perhaps best summarised by its final line, ''"As a narrative of loss, Der Brand succeeds like few other texts, but as a historical treatment of the allied air war, it is seriously deficient."'' this review analyses in particular the use of sources within Friedrich's work and also his refusal to apply analysis to the reasons for the bombing.  A particularly strong criticism is in Arnold's contrast between Friedrich's overt claim that the bombing had nothing to do with the [[holocaust]] and his implicit linkage of the two subjects through his use of the language of the holocaust to describe the effects of the bombings; however, Arnold fails to clarify what exactly he means with 'language of the holocaust' and why it should not be used in relation to atrocities perpetrated against Germans.

* ''Jörg Friedrich: Der Brand'',  Franz Kaessl, Öbib online (German Language).&lt;ref name="Kaessl"&gt;[http://www.lfs.bsb-muenchen.de/Informationen/bestandsaufbau/buchtipp-archiv/friedrich.htm "Jörg Friedrich: Der Brand"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040820035717/http://www.lfs.bsb-muenchen.de/Informationen/bestandsaufbau/buchtipp-archiv/friedrich.htm |date=2004-08-20 }}'',  Franz Kaessl, Öbib online (German Language)&lt;/ref&gt;
:From its opening sentence ''"The fate of German civilians in the Second World War was treated as a taboo topic for many decades"'', this review contrasts strongly with most English language reviews.  It points to the example of [[Günter Grass]] as an author recently discovered the suffering of the war, whilst reviews elsewhere have claimed that Grass's work of the 1960s is actually a far more powerful portrait of the effects of wars on civilians.&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;[http://www.powells.com/review/2003_08_07.html ''The Tin Book''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304125752/http://www.powells.com/review/2003_08_07.html |date=2005-03-04 }}, Ruth Franklin, ''The New Republic Online'', 7 August 2003, retrieved 5 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end the review concludes that the book should give a new view on history, not a new assignment of blame.

*:See the excellent reviews submitted to the H-German network by Joerg Arnold, 3 November 2003, and Douglas Pfeifer, 4 November 2003, which appropriately address, I believe, the strengths and weaknesses of this work — Pfeiffer's with more emphasis on the military and political issues, Arnold's with greater emphasis on the moral and conceptual problems. Others have also indicated the deficiencies of the book as a scholarly source. See for instance Horst Boogs’ summary list of errors in his contribution to ''Ein Volk von Opfern? Die neue Debatte um den Bombenkrieg 1940-45, Rowohlt, Berlin, 2003.'' Obviously many issues are contentious in this debate. The most parochial issues are those that concern historians as such. To what extent can the historian merely report or dissect the differing positions without engaging his own sense of moral judgment? Second, what sort of rhetoric is legitimate in a historical account?

The review on H-German network by Joerg Arnold is online.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=8358 online Arnold review, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louis-Pierre Anquetil''' (21 February 1723 – 6 September 1808) was a [[French people|French]] [[historian]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Paris]] on 21 February 1723.{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=90}} In 1741, he joined the religious community of the [[Abbey of St Genevieve|Génofévains]], where he took [[holy orders]] and became professor of [[theology]] and [[literature]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=4}} Later, he became rector of the seminary at [[Reims]], where he published the 3-volume "Civil and Political History of Reims" ({{lang-fr|Histoire civile et politique de Reims}}), in 1756 and 1757.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=4}} In 1759, he was appointed prior of the abbey de la Roe in [[Anjou]]; shortly thereafter he became director of the college of [[Senlis, Oise|Senlis]].{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=90}} While there, he composed a history of France in the 16th and 17th centuries (''{{lang|fr|Esprit de la Ligue, ou histoire politique des troubles de France pendant les XVI&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; et XVII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècles}}'') published in 1767.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=4}} The year before, he had obtained the curacy or priory of [[Chateau-Renard]] near [[Montargis]].{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=90}} He also became a member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Penny Cyclopaedia |publisher=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge |date=1833 |p=56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the [[French Revolution]], he moved to the curacy of [[La Villette, Seine|La Villette]] near Paris but, during the [[Reign of Terror]], he was imprisoned at [[Prison Saint-Lazare|St-Lazare]].{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=90}} While there, he began his summary of world history (''{{lang|fr|Précis de l'histoire universelle}}''), afterwards published in nine volumes.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=4}} On the establishment of the [[Institut de France|National Institute]], he was elected as a 2nd-class member of the [[Académie des sciences morales et politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Science]].{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=90}} He was also employed by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]],{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=90}} an experience which informed his treatment of the last three kings of the [[Ancient Regime]] (''{{lang|fr|Motifs des guerres et des traités de paix sous [[Louis XIV]], [[Louis XV]], [[Louis XVI]]}}'').{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=4}}

He is said to have been asked by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] to write his 14-volume "History of France" (''{{lang|fr|Histoire de France}}'', 1805). [[Augustin Thierry]] criticized the work as "cold and colourless", and mentioned that Anquetil compared unfavorably to other noted French historians.{{sfn|A'Becket|1907}} The work was compiled at second or third hand{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=4}} and censurable in many respects{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=90}} but went through numerous editions and made Anquetil famous. It was continued by Adolphe Bouillet in 6 more volumes.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=4}} He died on 6 September 1808.{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=90}}

His younger brother [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Abraham]] was a famous [[oriental studies|orientalist]].

'''Mark Andrew Peel''' (born 17 October 1959), historian and academic, is the Director of Educational Innovation at the [[University of Leicester]]. He also served the university as Provost (from 2015 to 2017), Pro Vice Chancellor (Student Experience) and Head of the College of Arts, Humanities and Law. Before going to Leicester, he was Professor of Modern Cultural and Social History and Head of the School of the Arts at the [[University of Liverpool]] and a Professor and Head of the School of Historical Studies in the Faculty of Arts at [[Monash University]] in Australia. He holds degrees from Flinders University (BA (Hons), 1980 and MA, 1983), Johns Hopkins University (MA, 1985) and Melbourne University (PhD, 1993) and was appointed a full Professor in 2007. He was elected as a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia in 2008 and became a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society in 2010.{{Ref|ASSA}}

Peel's interest in student transition to university education led to a report in the federal government's Higher Education Series in 1999{{Ref|HES}} and a research project on school-leavers' experiences of university teaching.{{Ref|JIR}} Peel has also contributed to debates about history teaching and curriculum, especially through his paper "The Essentials of Australian History", which formed part of the 1999 National Inquiry into School History{{Ref|dest}}, through his work as an advisor on Australian history to the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority and through two surveys on university curricula and teaching for the Australian Historical Association. In 2008, the Australian Learning and Teaching Council awarded him one of its Citations for Outstanding Contributions to Student Learning, for "sustained contributions to the imaginative teaching of history, and to the transition, progress and welfare of students in his own and other universities"{{Ref|ALTC}}. In the same year, he was also awarded one of three Vice-Chancellor's Awards for Teaching Excellence at Monash.{{Ref|MONU}}

'''Martin E. Jay''' (born 1944) is the Sidney Hellman Ehrman Professor of History at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He is an [[Intellectual History|intellectual historian]] whose research interests have connected history with other academic and intellectual activities, such as the [[Critical Theory|critical theory of the Frankfurt School]], [[social theory]], [[cultural critic]]ism, and [[historiography]].

==Career==
Jay received his B.A. from [[Union College]] in 1965. In 1971, he completed his  Ph.D. in History at [[Harvard]] under the tutelage of [[H. Stuart Hughes]]. His dissertation was later revised into the book ''The Dialectical Imagination,'' which covers the history of the [[Frankfurt School]] from 1923-1950. While he was conducting research for his dissertation, he established a correspondence and friendship with many of the members of the Frankfurt School. He was closest to [[Leo Löwenthal]], who had provided him access to personal letters and documents for his research. Jay's work since then has explored [[Marxism]], [[socialism]], [[historiography]], [[cultural criticism]], [[visual culture]], and the place of [[post-structuralism]] and [[post-modernism]] in European intellectual history. His current research is focused on nominalism and photography. He is a recipient of the 2010/2011 Berlin Prize Fellowship from the [[American Academy in Berlin]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

He also has a regular column in the quarterly journal ''[[Skidmore College#Salmagundi|Salmagundi]]''.

==List of Marwanid rulers==
#Abu Shujā' Badh ibn Dustak (983–990)
#Al-Hasan ibn Marwān (990–997)
#Mumahhid al-Dawla Sa’īd (997–1010)

#Nizām al-Dawla Nasr (1061–1079)
#Nasir al-Dawla Mansur (1079–1085)

===Bādh ibn Dustak===
The founder of the dynasty was a shepherd, Abu Shujā Bādh ibn Dustak. He left his cattle, took up arms and became a valiant chief of war, obtaining celebrity. When a member of the [[Buyid dynasty]], [[Adud al-Dawla]], who ruled Iraq, died in 983, Badh took Mayyāfāriqīn. He also conquered Diyarbakır, as well as a variety of urban sites on the northern shores of [[Lake Van]]. 

During the rebellion of [[Bardas Phokas the Younger]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]], Bādh took advantage of the chaotic political situation to raid the plain of [[Muş|Mush]] in [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]], an Armenian princedom annexed by the Byzantine Empire in 966.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Holmes, ''Basil II And the Governance of Empire, 976-1025'', (Oxford University Press, 2005), 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abu Ali Al-Hasan ibn Marwān===

Elias of Nisibis, a [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]] chronicler, mentioned shortly the life of Abu ‘Ali al-Hasan. After the death of his uncle Badh, the elder son of Marwan came back to Hisn-Kayfa, married the widow of the old warrior chief. He fought the last [[Hamdanids]], confused them and took again all the fortresses. Elias related the tragic end of this prince who was killed in Amid ([[Diyarbakır]]) in 997&lt;ref&gt;''Marwanids'', Carole Hillenbrand, '''The Encyclopaedia of Islam''', Vol. VI, ed. C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, B.Lewis and C. Pellat, (Brill, 1991), 626.&lt;/ref&gt; by rebellious inhabitants. His brother Abu Mansur Sa’id succeeded to him, under the name of Mumahhid al-Dawla. In 992, after Bad's death and a series of Byzantine punitive raids around Lake Van, Emperor [[Basil II]] (r. 976–1025)  was able to negotiate a lasting peace with the Kurdish emirate.

===Mumahhid al-Dawla Sa'id===
[[File:Merwanid Said, 391 AH, Silvan.jpg|thumb|150px|Merwanid Said, 391 AH (ca. 1000 AD), Silvan, Diyarbakır, Turkey]]
Mumahhid, a skilful diplomat, could make use of the Byzantines' ambitions. The relations of this prince with the Emperor Basil II were quite friendly. When Basil learnt of the murder of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] potentate [[David III of Tao]], who had left by testament his kingdom to the Byzantine Empire, he stopped the campaign that he had begun in [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] for making sure of Arabian emirs' obedience and he crossed the [[Euphrates]]. He annexed David's state, received Mumahhid al-Dawla with honours and made peace with him.

Mumahhid al-Dawla took advantage of the peace to restore the walls of his capital Maïpherqat ([[Mayyafariqin]]), where an inscription still commemorates this event.

In 1000 when Basil II travelled from [[Cilicia]] to the lands of [[David III Kuropalates]] (Akhlat and Manzikert), Mumahhid al-Dawla came to offer his submission to the emperor and in return he received the high rank of ''[[magistros]]'' and ''[[dux|doux]]'' of the East.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Cheynet, ''Basil II and Asia Minor'', pp.71-108 in ''Byzantium in the Year 1000'' edited by Paul Magdalino, International Congress of Historical Sciences, 284 pp., Brill Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|90-04-12097-1}}, p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sharwin ibn Muhammad, usurper===
In 1010, Mumahhid al-Dawla was assassinated by his ''[[ghulam]]'', Sharwin ibn Muhammad, who assumed rulership. He legitimized his rule with the ancient 'law of the Turks', that who kills the ruler becomes himself the successor. However this archaic rule and Sharwin's rule were soon contested, and Sharwin was overthrown. Coins are known from his brief reign.

===Nasr al-Dawla Ahmad ibn Marwan===
[[File:Merwanid Nasr al Dawla Ahmed, 405 AH, Silvan.jpg|thumb|150px|Inscription with Nasr al-Dawla's name, 405 AH (ca. 1014 AD), Silvan, Diyarbakır, Turkey]]
He was the third son of Marwan to ascend the throne. A clever politician, he skilfully navigated between the surrounding great powers: the [[Buyid]] emir [[Sultan al-Dawla]], the [[Fatimid]] caliph of [[Egypt]] [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]] and Basil II. Elias of Nisibis has written that Nasr al-Dawla Ahmad ibn Marwan, "the victorious emir", subdued ''Ibn Dimne'', his [[vassal]] in Diyarbakır, in 1011. He signed with the Byzantine Empire a pact of mutual non-aggression, but violated it once or twice. The renown of this Kurdish Muslim prince grew so much that the inhabitants of al-Ruha, ([[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], present-day [[Sanli Urfa]]), at the west, called him for being released of an Arab chief. Nasr al-Dawla took the city of Edessa in 1026, and added it to his possessions. This event has been reported by the famous western-Syriac author [[Bar Hebraeus]] (1226–1286).  So Nasr al-Dawla annexed Edessa, but the city was retaken by the Byzantine general [[George Maniakes]] in 1031. In 1032 he sent an army of 5000 horsemen, under the command of his general Bal, to re-take the town from Arab tribes supported by Byzantium. The Kurdish commander Bal took the city and killed the Arab tribal chief, then he wrote to his lord  asking for reinforcements "if you want to save your Lordship on Kertastan (Kurdistan)".

[[File:Merwanid Nasr al Dawla Ahmed, 410 AH, Silvan.jpg|thumb|150px|Inscription with Nasr al-Dawla's name, 410 AH (ca. 1019 AD), Silvan, Diyarbakır, Turkey]]
The long rule of Nasr al-Dawla represented the apogee of Marwanid power. He built a new citadel on a hill of Mayyafariqin where stood the Church of Virgin, as well as built bridges and public baths. He restored the observatory. Some libraries fit out the mosques of Mayyafarikin and Amid. He invited well-known scholars, historians and poets to his royal court, among them [[Ibn al-Athir]], [[Abd Allah al-Kazaruni]] (poet), and [[al-Tihami]]. He sheltered political refugees such as the future [[Abbassid]] caliph [[al-Muqtadi]] (1075–1099). In 1054 he had to acknowledge as his own liege [[Toghrul Beg]] the [[Seljuq Turks|Seljuq]], who ruled on the largest part of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]], but he kept his territories. This fine period of peace and good feelings between [[Kurds]] and Syriacs was rich in creations in the field of cultural life. It was dense for trade, active for arts and crafts, impressive in short. Nasr al-Dawla  left in Diyarbakır monumental inscriptions that show still now the artistic brightness of its reign.
[[File:Merwanid Nasr al Dawla Ahmed, 416 AH, Silvan.jpg|thumb|150px|Inscription with Nasr al-Dawla's name, 416 AH (ca. 1025 AD), Silvan, Diyarbakır, Turkey]]

===Twilight===
After Nasr al-Dawla's death, the Marwanids' power declined. His second son, Nizam, succeeded him and ruled until 1079, then followed his son Nasir al-Dawla Mansur. The end of the Marwanid dynasty came about by treason. Ibn Jahir, a former vizier, left the Diyar Bakr and went to [[Baghdad]]. There, he convinced the Seljuq sultan [[Malik Shah I]] (1072–1092), a grand-nephew of Toghrul Beg, and the famous vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk]], to allow him to assault Mayyafarikin. When the city was taken, Ibn Jahir took off the great treasures that belonged to the Marwanids and detained them greedily for himself. Henceforth, the Diyar Bakr fell almost entirely under the direct rule of the Seljuqs. The last emir, Nasir al-Dawla Mansur, kept only the city of Jazirat Ibn ‘Umar (present-day [[Cizre]] in south-eastern Turkey).

[[File:Merwanid Nizam al Dawla Nasr, 464 AH, Amida.jpg|thumb|150px|Inscription with Nizam al-Dawla's name, 464 AH (ca. 1072 AD), Amida, Diyarbakır, Turkey]]

'''Odd Langholm''' (born 8 November 1928) is a Norwegian economist and [[History of economic thought|historian of economic thought]]. He spent his entire academic career at the [[Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration]], being a professor from 1966 to 1998.

==Personal life==
He was born in [[Haugesund]] as a son of Karl Johan Langholm (1891–1974) and Anna Stampen (1894–1976), who were both teachers.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2002|volume=5|title=Odd Langholm|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|first=Arnljot Strømme|last=Svendsen|authorlink=Arnljot Strømme Svendsen|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Odd_Langholm/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the younger brother of historian [[Sivert Langholm]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Odd Langholm|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Odd_Langholm|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 he married Grethe Togstad.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; They settled in [[Bergen]].

==Career==
Langholm took the [[examen artium]] in 1947 and the business school exam in 1949. He then moved from Haugesund to Bergen, to study at the [[Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration]]. He graduated with the [[siviløkonom|siv.øk.]] degree in 1954. For the next years he worked as a lecturer there, and took the [[dr.oecon.]] degree at the same institution in 1964, on the thesis ''Tidshorisonten for deterministiske planleggingsmodeller i normativ bedriftsøkonomikk''. He was the first person to take both the siv.øk. degree and the [[doctorate]] at the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He was promoted to professor in 1966.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

After 1969 his focus shifted from [[business administration]] towards the study of [[History of economic thought|mediaeval economic thought]]. Between 1979 and 1998 he published five works in this field, many derived from sources in [[Latin]], a language in which he was skilled. These works were ''Price and Value in the Aristotelian Tradition. A Study in Scholastic Economic Sources'' (1979), ''Wealth and Money in the Aristotelian Tradition'' (1983), ''The Aristotelian Analyses of Usury'' (1984), ''Economics in the Medieval Schools. Wealth, Exchange, Value, Money and Usury according to the Paris Theological Tradition, 1200–1350'' (1992) and ''The Legacy of Scholasticism in Economic Thought. Antecedents of Choice and Power'' (1998). This body of work has given him international recognition.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Langholm received an [[honorary degree]] at the [[Åbo Akademi University]] in 1992. For his sixtieth birthday, a [[Festschrift]] was issued.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He retired from his professorship in 1998.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

'''Johann Ernst Otto Stobbe''' (June 28, 1831&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; May 19, 1887) was a German [[historian]] and law professor born in [[Königsberg]].

He studied history, [[philology]] and [[jurisprudence]] at the [[University of Königsberg]], earning his law degree in 1853. He continued his education in [[Leipzig|Leipsic]] and [[Göttingen]], and in 1856 received his habilitation. Soon afterwards he became a professor of [[German law]] at Königsberg, later holding similar positions at the Universities of [[University of Breslau|Breslau]] (from 1859) and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] (from 1872).

== Written works ==
Stobbe was the author of several works in the fields of [[German law]] and [[legal history]]. In addition he is remembered for a scholarly work on Jews in Germany during the [[Middle Ages]] called ''Die Juden in Deutschland während des Mittelalters'' (1866). The following are a few of his better known publications:
* ''Zur Geschichte des deutschen Vertragsrechts'' (The history of German [[contract law]], 1855)
* ''Geschichte der deutschen Rechtsquellen'' (History of German legal sources, 1860–64; two volumes)
* ''Beiträge zur Geschichte des deutschen Rechts'' (Contributions to the history of German justice, 1865)
* ''Die Juden in Deutschland während des Mittelalters in politischer, socialer und rechtlicher Beziehung'' (Jews in Germany during the [[Middle Ages]] in political, social and legal respects, 1866)
* ''Hermann Conring, der Begründer der deutschen Rechtsgeschichte'' ([[Hermann Conring]], the founder of German legal history, 1870)
* ''Handbuch des deutschen Privatrechts'' (Textbook of German law, 1871; five volumes).

'''Pierre Matthieu''' (1563&amp;ndash;1621) was a [[France|French]] writer, poet, historian and dramatist.

==Biography==
Pierre Matthieu was born at [[Pesmes]] in the [[Haute-Saône]].  He studied under the Jesuits and mastered Latin, Ancient Greek and Hebrew.  At the age of 19, he served his father as adjunct at the Collège of Vercel (in the [[Doubs]]) and it was there that his tragedy ''Esther'' (published in Lyon in 1585) was performed by the students.  He studied law at [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]], received his doctorat in 1586 and became a lawyer at the Présidial Court of [[Lyon]].

Although he had expressed his attachment to the [[House of Guise]] and the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], he was among those chosen and sent by the inhabitants of Lyon to King [[Henry IV of France]] in February 1594 to assure the new king of their fidelity.  With the king having visited the city the year before, Matthieu was put in charge of organizing the ceremonies of the royal reception.  Subsequently, he moved to [[Paris]] and, with the protection of [[Pierre Jeannin]], he became historiograph.  He was esteemed by the royal court and enjoyed special access to Henry IV.

He fell ill accompanying [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] at the siege of [[Montauban]] and died in Toulouse at the age of 58.

==Works==
Pierre Matthieu wrote five tragedies:
* ''Clytemnestre'' (1578) - the story of [[Clytemnestra]]
* ''Esther'' (1581) - the story of [[Esther]]
* ''Vashti'' (1589) - the story of [[Vashti]]
* ''Aman, de la perfidie'' (1589) - the story of [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]]
* ''La Guisiade'' (1589) - an attack of [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] and justification of his assassination.

The five tragedies of Matthieu sought &amp;mdash; despite their use of Biblical or ancient stories (other than ''La Guisade'') &amp;mdash; to explore contemporary issues of the [[French Wars of Religion]] and to justify the noble defense of religion; the tragedies' heroes were generally allegorical representations of [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]].

As poet, he published ''Tablettes de la vie et de la mort'' and ''Quatrains de la vie et de la mort''.

His novels, ''La Magicienne'', ''Aelius Sejanus'' and ''La Femme Cathenoise'' were hostile to [[Concini]] and his wife.

He also wrote several works of history and royal historiography.

The '''Great National Assembly of the Serb People in Montenegro''' ({{lang-sr|Велика народна скупштина српског народа у Црној Гори/Velika narodna skupština srpskog naroda u Crnoj Gori}}), commonly known as the '''Podgorica Assembly''' (Подгоричка скупштина/Podgorička skupština), was an ad hoc assembly convened in November 1918, after World War I in the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] by the Serbian authorities, with the goal of formalising the unification, i.e. annexation of Montenegro by Serbia, and dethrone the Montenegrin [[House of Petrović-Njegoš|Petrović-Njegoš dynasty]], in favour of the Serbian [[House of Karađorđević]]. It was organized by a committee appointed by the Serbian government. The two opposing sides were known as the "Greens" and the "Whites", in favour of a confederation (independence) and unification (annexation), respectively. The assembly concluded the decision to merge Montenegro with Serbia. The [[creation of Yugoslavia]] followed.

==Prelude==
The Montenegrin government capitulated to the forces of [[Austria-Hungary]] on 6 January 1916 during [[First World War|The Great War]]. King [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas I]] refused to sign capitulation and left the country to allied Italy where his daughter was married to the king. On 17 July 1917 the [[Yugoslav Committee]] and the Government of the Kingdom of Serbia signed the [[Corfu Declaration]], which, accepted by the Great Allied Powers, laid the foundations for a South Slavic state. In 1918 the Serbian Royal Army took control of Montenegro from the [[Central Powers]]' occupation; [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] mission of Serbia, Italy, France, the United Kingdom and the United States were assigned to provisionally occupy and establish control over Montenegro.

Montenegro was planning and preparing unification with Serbia for more than 50 years with the wish of [[Nikola I of Montenegro|Nikola I]] to become a ruler of the united state. This project had failed in 1903, after which the population became divided in political blocks, for a united state (Serbia) or for confederation (Serbia and Montenegro). The last negotiations between Montenegro and Serbia started shortly before World War I in 1914 about military, economic and foreign affairs. The most important disagreement point during the last negotiations was the position of Montenegro in the union: as an equal partner to Serbia or as a province of Serbia. In Montenegro the strongest supporter of unconditional union was later prime minister Andrija Radović, titled by the Serbian government which had been working on annexation of Montenegro from 1866.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Since the beginning of October 1918, various initiatives were raised to formalize unification with the war drawing to a close. Even [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas I]] gave support to new united Yugoslav confederation &lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/11/08/98274115.pdf Montenegro puts hope in president Wilson]&lt;/ref&gt; but this position was still against [[Belgrade]]'s wish of united state. Various tiny assemblies in territory controlled by the Serbian army were organized similar to the ones in the former [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] lands.

On 15 October 1918 the Serbian government named a "Central Executive Committee for Unification of Serbia and Montenegro" consisting of four strong proponents of a union of the two states, two from Serbia and two from Montenegro, that would organize the process of unification. With this decision the Kingdom of Serbia abolished the legal Montenegro parliament, just like Austro-Hungary did earlier, with the explanation: "Because 2/5 of parliament members are abroad it is necessary to elect new".&lt;ref name="Annihilation of a nation"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/04/16/107051333.pdf Annihilation of a nation]&lt;/ref&gt;  This unconstitutional decision supported by Serbian military in Montenegro was against an order of the king of Montenegro, for gathering of parliament on first day after armistice was signed.&lt;ref name="Annihilation of a nation"/&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Electoral rules==
On 25 October 1918 in [[Berane]], the city of one of the committee's members, the committee decided to schedule a nationwide election with new election laws created by the Central Executive Committee for Unification of Serbia and Montenegro. 165 members were elected to form a parliament called the "Great People's Assembly of the Serbian People in Montenegro" to decide about the form and process of unification of Montenegro with Serbia, as well as the rules of its election.

The people chose electors by secret ballot, who would subsequently nominate the assembly.
* Each captaincy elected 10 electors
* Each district (newly gained unrepresented territories from the Balkan Wars) elected 15 electors
* Each town below 5,000 residents ([[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], [[Ulcinj]], [[Kolašin]], [[Berane]] and [[Bijelo Polje]]) elected 5 electors and cities with 5,000 or more citizens ([[Cetinje]], [[Podgorica]], [[Pljevlja]], [[Peć]] and [[Đakovica]]) elected 10 electors

The electors were the democratic holders of the national vote from the people, but they were supposed to elect the Members of the Parliament themselves in order to secure the balance and equally represent all levels of the community by profession, religious determination and ethnic affiliation.

Every male Montenegrin aged 25 or more had the right to be elected into the Parliament:
* Two MPs were to be elected from each captaincy 
* Three MPS from every district 
* One MP from every town and 
* Two MPs from every city 
During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], Nicholas I's representative and future prime minister of Montenegro (de jure) General Gvozdenović attacked this election law: "Mere villages had been permitted to elect four deputies, while entire
districts had only sent one or two representatives".&lt;ref name="montenet.org"&gt;[http://www.montenet.org/2001/jk.html General Gvozdenović statement on Paris Peace Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; Other problems with the election were that voting was made without the voters' lists,&lt;ref name="montenegrina.net"&gt;[http://www.montenegrina.net/pages/pages1/istorija/cg_izmedju_1_i_2_svj_rata/podgoricka_skupstina_n_martinovic.htm Niko Martinović:Crna Gora Biografski zapisi II Luča slobode i trajanja]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Serbian army didn't allow the opponents of union to enter Montenegro before elections ended &lt;ref name="montenegrina.net"/&gt;

==Election==
Two organized lists were opposed:
*White List - [[Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V|Metropolitan bishop Gavrilo Dožić of Peć]]
*[[Zelenaši|Green List]] - Špiro Tomanović

The Whites were opponents of the reigning King Nicholas I, presenting him as an enemy to democracy, the people and betrayer of his dynasty's original foundations. They were led by [[Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V|Metropolitan bishop Gavrilo Dožić of Peć]] (later to become the Metropolitan of the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]] in 1920), and stood for direct, immediate and unconditional unification with the Kingdom of Serbia. The Greens were pro-dynastic supporters of King Nicholas I and supported a conditional and loose unification of Montenegro with Serbia.

After quick but major preparations, the elections were held on 19 November 1918. The Whites won at all locations except Montenegrin capital [[Cetinje]], but in Bijelo Polje, [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] and [[Gusinje]] instead of elections the electors were appointed by the local community, and due to the subsequent rapidly changing following acts elections were never properly repeated.

The result of the elections had become clear to international community before it was proclaimed. In a last push to protect an independent Montenegro, the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], whose king was married to a daughter of Montenegrin king Nicholas, tried to take Cetinje and proclaim restored Montenegrin state. The attack started from the [[Bay of Kotor]], but the Italian forces withdrew after the possibility of war with [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and due to pressure of the other [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]].

The electors then publicly nominated a session of the parliament with 165 MPs. 56 MPs had a PhD, 6 were teachers and priests, 25 were Clan Chieftains, 14 were agricultural workers and 3 youth. The several Green electors refused to show up and boycotted the assembly.

==The parliament==
The Great National Assembly was constituted on 24 November 1918 not in the Montenegro parliament which was in Cetinje, but in the Podgorica Tobacco Monopoly building. During that time Podgorica was the largest and most populated city in Montenegro. In two following sessions of 25 November 1918, the parliament elected its president, two vice-presidents and the Secretary. The assembly members demanded that Montenegro's independence be restored prior to any discussion about union with Serbia. This was refused by president of the assembly Savo Cerović: "This will not lead to anything good".&lt;ref name="Serbia 1918"&gt;[http://www.montenet.org/history/podgskup.htm Unification of Montenegro and Serbia (1918) - Podgorica's Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November 1918 when the assembly building was encircled by a detachment of the Serbian army,&lt;ref name="Serbia 1918"/&gt; the parliament unanimously adopted a resolution with the following decisions:
#To depose [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nicholas I]] [[House of Petrović-Njegoš|Petrović-Njegoš]] and his dynasty from the Montenegrin throne
#To unite Montenegro with the brotherly Serbia into a single state under the [[House of Karađorđević]], and in such entity to then enter into a common Fatherland with our people under three names Serbs, Croats and Slovenes
#To establish a National Executive Committee made up of five individuals, that shall handle the administrative affairs, until the unification of Serbia and Montenegro is complete
#To announce the Assembly's decisions to:
#*the ex-King of Montenegro Nikola Petrović
#*the Government of the Kingdom of Serbia
#*the friendly [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] (the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]]), and all neutral countries

At the time, because of the threat of foreign claim of the liberated lands, detachments of Serbian army (with many volunteers from other nations of future Yugoslavia who helped liberate territories under [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Italy]] and Nicholas I) were dispatched throughout the newly liberated territory (which was unrecognised as part of any state until [[Treaty of Versailles]] 1920. Because this territory did not belong to any recognised state, the threat of entry of foreign forces was annihilated until the unification was complete by the presence of the only recognised, organised army among [[South Slavs]] of Yugoslavia, Serbian army (with many [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin Serb]], [[Croat]] and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] volunteers).

The MPs called upon the long lasting desire to unite the Serb people from Montenegro with the one in Serbia, and sent a copy of the Montenegrin Crown to King [[Peter I of Serbia|Petar I Karađorđević]] with a delegation that went to Belgrade led by Metropolitan Dožić on 17 December 1918. In his 24 December speech for [[The Associated Press]] King Nicholas I repeated the Montenegrin wish to become part of a "Yugoslav confederation, but preserve its autonomy, independence and customs" &lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/12/25/97055594.pdf King Nicholas will meet Wilson]&lt;/ref&gt;

The parliament continued its session until 29 November 1918, when the "Central Montenegrin Committee for Unification" of five members was appointed and sworn to duty.

==Epilogue==
After the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was proclaimed, the historic entities including Montenegro remained, parallel to Serbia. The Great Serb People's Assembly convened for the last time on 27 December 1919 when it elected the Montenegrin delegation to the Collective National Representing Body of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes that was to draft a Constitution.

The deposed King and his internationally recognized Government of the Kingdom of Montenegro in Exile in [[Neilly]] was informed of this by French intelligence. Nicholas discarded the decisions of the assembly, claiming it was illegal, calling upon the [[Constitution of Montenegro]], and called forth the Montenegrins not to accept the annexation. Prime Minister [[Evgenije Popović]] wrote to the Great Powers in complaint.

The Greens, led by [[Krsto Zrnov Popović]], supported by the Italians, changed their desire to include a completely independent Montenegrin state and resorted to rebellion. With slogan "For justice, honour and the freedom of Montenegro",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeckler.de/pdf/p_seer_montenegro.pdf Florian Bieber: Montenegro in transition, page 130]&lt;/ref&gt; they raised on Christmas Eve of 7 January 1919 the [[Christmas Uprising]], with an attempt to restore independent Montenegro. The international community opposed uprising and the Serbian forces quelled the rebellion in blood,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montenegro.org/pictures/news1919.gif Serbs wipe out royalist party in Montenegro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302171836/http://www.montenegro.org/pictures/news1919.gif |date=2010-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; raising the rebel sieges of completely cut-off Cetinje and Nikšić. The insurgents mostly found amnesty, but some form of little guerrilla resistance from continued until 1926.

During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], a representative of Montenegro king was called to give a speech &lt;ref name="montenet.org"/&gt; in which he protested annexation, but for the [[Treaty of Versailles]], only the representative of Yugoslav Montenegro was called. At these two conferences, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was internationally recognized, but the Montenegrin question itself was left to be later resolved because of a bloody conflict escalating in Montenegro.

The independence of Montenegro was recognized by the Great Powers until 1922 after which all states accepted the Yugoslav claim on this state. During the 1918–22 period, annexation was supported by France, independence by Italy, and Great Britain took their middle road with suppression report about method practised by Serbia and French generals (in Montenegro) Franchet d'Esperey and Venal in Montenegro.&lt;ref name="Annihilation of a nation"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The state of Montenegro [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|regained its independence in 2006]] and the event was interpreted as a break of the assembly, initiating a controversy over its decisions. The minor ruling [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro]] wanted to formally cancel the decisions of the Podgorica Assembly by the [[Parliament of Montenegro]] after the adoption of the new Constitution in late 2007. This was met with another controversy, as whether the decisions of the Podgorica Assembly were legal, as they were accepted as state decisions thus far, including opposition from the [[Liberal Party of Montenegro]] of the act, which upholds that abolishing a decision would automatically legitimize itself. The long-term Prime Minister [[Milo Djukanovic]] of the dominant [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] noted on the day of celebration of the victory in the independence referendum the people had abolished its decisions from 1918.

'''[[Pseudo-]]Dorotheos of Monemvasia''' ({{lang-el|Δωρόθεος Μονεμβασίας}}) is the name given to the unknown author (or compiler) of a Greek-language [[chronicle]] titled ''Historical Book'' (Βιβλίον Ιστορικόν), published at [[Venice]] in 1631. The work contains a history of the world from [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] until the early 17th century, and purports to have been written by a non-existent [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Monemvasia]] named Dorotheos. The book became a popular source of historical knowledge during the period of [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman rule]] in Greece.

'''Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie''' (also '''Lindesay''' or '''Lyndsay'''; c. 1532&amp;ndash;1580) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[chronicle]]r, author of ''The Historie and Chronicles of Scotland, 1436&amp;ndash;1565'', the first history of Scotland to be composed in [[Scots language|Scots]] rather than [[Latin]].

==Biography==
Of the family of the Lindsays of the Byres, a grandson of [[Patrick Lindsay, 4th Lord Lindsay]],  Robert was born at [[Pitscottie]], in the parish of [[Ceres, Fife|Ceres]], [[Fife]], which he held in lease at a later period. His ''Historie'', the only work by which he is remembered, is described as a continuation of that of [[Hector Boece]], translated by [[John Bellenden]]. Although it sometimes degenerates into a mere chronicle of short entries, it is not without passages of great picturesqueness. Sir [[Walter Scott]] made use of it in his narrative poem ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]''; and, in spite of its inaccuracy in details, it is useful for the social history of the period. Lindesay's share in the ''Historie'' was generally supposed to end with 1565; but Dr Aeneas Mackay considers that the frank account of the events connected with [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], between 1565 and 1575 contained in one of the manuscripts is by his hand and was only suppressed because it was too faithful in its record of contemporary affairs. The ''Historie'' was first published in 1728. A complete edition of the text, based on the Laing MS. No. 218 in the [[university of Edinburgh]], was published by the Scottish Text Society in 1899 under the editorship of Aeneas Mackay. The manuscript, formerly in the possession of John Scott of Halkshill, is fuller, and, though in a later hand, is, on the whole, a better representative of Lindsay's text.

According to the ''Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen'':

:As to the ''Chronicles'' themselves, it is not perhaps very easy to determine in what language they should be spoken of. They present a strange compound of endless and aimless garrulity, simplicity, credulity, and graphic delineation; the latter, however, evidently the effect not of art or design, but of a total want of them. He describes events with all the circumstantiality of an eyewitness, and with all the prolixity of one who is determined to leave nothing untold, however trifling it may be.

:But his credulity, in particular, seems to have been boundless, and is remarkable even for the credulous age in which he lived. He appears to have believed, without question, every thing which was told him; and, believing it, has carefully recorded it. After detailing at some length, and with great gravity, all the circumstances of the mysterious summons of [[Devil|Plotcock]], previous to the [[battle of Flodden]], "Verily," he says, "the author of this, that caused me write the manner of the summons, was a landed gentleman, who was at that time twenty years of age, and was in the town the time of the said summons; and thereafter, when the field was stricken, he swore to me, there was no man that escaped that was called in this summons, but that one man alone which made his protestation."

:The earnest and honest simplicity of the good old chronicler, however, is exceedingly amusing. He aims at nothing beyond a mere record of what he conceived to be facts, and these he goes on detailing, with a great deal of incoherence, and all the unintellectual precision, of an artificial process, neither feeling, passion, nor mind ever appearing to mingle in the slightest degree with his labours. These characteristics of the chronicles of Lindsay have greatly impaired their credibility, and have almost destroyed all confidence in them as authorities.

[[File:Ruben Gasparyan.jpg|thumbnail|Ruben Gasparyan]]

'''Ruben Henrik Gasparyan''' (June 25, 1962 – July 10, 2013) was an expert in Armenian history, a   university professor and researcher  at the Department of Modern History of the Institute of History of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Armenia]].

==Biography==
Gasparyan was born in [[Yerevan]], and  graduated in 1984 from [[Yerevan State Pedagogical University]], with a major  in History and Pedagogy at the Department of History and Geography Studies. From 1984 to 1989, he worked as a history teacher in the Akunq village school in the province of Abovyan (later renamed Kotayk), while commencing  extramural postgraduate studies at the National Academy of Sciences. His thesis “The socio-political life of the Armenians of Cilicia in 1900-1921s” was supervised by Dr. Haykaz Poghosyan. From 1989 to 1996 he  taught history and social sciences at No. 57 secondary school, while beginning research on the  [[Cilician]] Armenians .

During the Young Researchers’ 20th session at the NAS RA Institute of History in 1986, Ruben Gasparyan delivered a speech on Adana’s bloody massacres of innocent civilians. The researcher impressed his audience with his remarkable research skills and the advanced methods he had applied to his research work. The period between 1988 and 1991 was a restless time. The Artsakh liberation movement began in February 1988. It was another wake-up call for the Armenian people. Gasparyan didn’t stay aloof and, like most of the people, actively participated in mass demonstrations and rallies in support of Artsakh, helping to obtain essential supplies, including books, for the people of Artsakh.

In 1991, Gasparyan defended his thesis and was awarded candidacy for a PhD in History. Shortly afterwards, he took a job as a researcher at the Department of New History of the NAS RA Institute of History. Gasparyan was thereupon elected Chair of the Young Researchers’ Council and continued in this role until 1997. Along with this job, he held the position of Scientific Secretary for four years’ time (1995-1999). 
From 1999 to 2009, he was in charge of the Department of Higher Education and the Department of Higher and Postgraduate Education at the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Armenia, and  ran classes for master's program students at Yerevan State University. In 2009, he returned  to the National Academy of Sciences. From 1 July 2010 to June 2011, he was  Head of the Department of the [[Armenian Question]] and the History of the [[Armenian Genocide]]. In June 2011, Gasparyan moved back to the Department of Modern History where he remained until the end of his life. Ruben Gasparyan would have brought the work on his doctoral thesis to a close but for the serious illness which hindered him from fulfilling it. The NAS RA Institute of History intends to develop Gasparyan’s research work for its final release and have it published in 2015.

==Books==

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Armenian l teachers, without any new history textbooks in their possession, would make use of the articles widely published in those days. Ruben Gasparyan was one of the authors whose articles appeared continually in a few periodicals, including “Mayreni” (Native) and “Azatamart” (Fight for Freedom).
In 1993, before the new textbooks would be ready for publication, the Ministry of Education decided to bring out a manual for the 9th grade schoolchildren. The aim was to elucidate, truthfully and anew, a number of key issues and pivotal moments of the 1900-1939s, which turned out to be a very complicated period of history. The revelation of the truth would contribute immensely to the writing of the new textbook, thereby enriching both the teachers’ and schoolchildren’s knowledge.
A group of the NAS RA Institute of History collaborators, under the leadership of Hrant Avetisyan, an associate member of the Academy of Sciences, designed a manual for the 9th grade schoolchildren. Ruben Gasparyan wrote one whole chapter which was titled “Western Armenia at the beginning of the 20th century” and outlined the country's economic development, national liberation movements in 1900-1908s, the Armenian Question in 1912-1914s and many other issues.

As soon as the manual was published, the NAS RA Institute of History editors were asked to write more history school-books for fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades. The academician Vladimir Barkhudaryan assembled a team of first-class writers from all over the country. Ruben Gasparyan and Ruben Sahakyan were assigned to provide the methodological part, i.e. questions, assignments and chapter summaries.  Gasparyan also authored Chapter 9 (“The massacres of the Western Armenians and the self-defense battles in 1890s”) of the eighth-grade history school-book which was reprinted in 2013.

In 2003, Gasparyan wrote Paragraphs 8 to 15 (pages 35–63) for the eighth-grade textbook “The History of the Armenian Church,” which was edited by P. Hovhannisyan and Bishop Abraham Mkrtchyan. Gasparyan’s monograph “The Armenians of Cilicia at the beginning of the 20th century” was published in 1999.

As a history professor at Yerevan State University,   Gasparyan developed a separate history course entitled “The History of the Voluntary Movements (19th century – 1921).” Gasparyan was convinced that it was highly essential to introduce the subject into the master program curriculum and gave the following explanation in justification of his resolution: “The voluntary movements, which arose at the beginning of the 19th century and ran on up to 1921, played a vital role in the Armenian history. This topic does require further elucidation. The history of the voluntary movements is closely linked with the national liberation struggle for the restoration of independent statehood.”

In the last few years of his life, Gasparyan would work with Ruben Sahakyan, his co-author. They first developed [[Hovhannes Ter-Martirosyan]]’s (also known as A-Do) unpublished pieces for the final release and then worked on the unpublished memoirs of Yeghishe Buranyan from Van. Sadly, both pieces came out after  Gasparyan's death. Gasparyan and his co-author had also begun work on the unpublished memoirs of Michael Ter-Martirosyan, A-Do’s younger brother, who was a national liberation movement activist. Michael (nicknamed Mar) was a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnak Party) and a participant of the occupation of the Ottoman Bank in Constantinople in 1896

{{Thomism}}
{{Catholic philosophy}}
The '''School of Salamanca''' ({{lang-es|Escuela de Salamanca}}) is the [[Renaissance]] of  thought in diverse intellectual areas by [[Spain|Spanish]] and  [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[theology|theologians]], rooted in the intellectual and pedagogical work of [[Francisco de Vitoria]]. From the beginning of the 16th century the traditional [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] conception of man and of his relation to [[God]] and to the world had been assaulted by the rise of [[humanism]], by the [[Protestant Reformation]] and by the [[Age of Exploration|new geographical discoveries]] and their consequences. These new problems were addressed by the School of Salamanca. The name refers to the [[University of Salamanca]], where de Vitoria and others of the school were based.

The leading figures of the school, theologians and jurists [[Francisco de Vitoria]], [[Domingo de Soto]], [[Martín de Azpilcueta]] (or Azpilicueta), [[Tomás de Mercado]], and [[Francisco Suárez]], were all scholars of [[natural law]] and of [[morality]], who undertook the reconciliation of the teachings of [[Thomas Aquinas]] with the new political-economic order. The themes of study centered on man and his practical problems (morality, economics, jurisprudence, etc.), but almost equally on a particular body of work accepted by all of them, as the ground against which to test their disagreements, including at times bitter polemics within the School.

The School of Salamanca in the broad sense may be considered more narrowly as two schools of thought coming in succession, that of the '''Salmanticenses''' and that of the '''[[Conimbricenses]]''' from the [[University of Coimbra]]. The first began with Francisco de Vitoria (1483–1546), and reached its high point with Domingo de Soto (1494–1560). The Conimbricenses were [[Jesuit]]s who, from the end of 16th century took over the intellectual leadership of the Catholic world from the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. Among those Jesuits were [[Luis de Molina]] (1535–1600), the aforementioned Francisco Suárez (1548–1617), and [[Giovanni Botero]] (1544–1617), who would continue the tradition in Italy.

The juridical doctrine of the School of Salamanca represented the end of medieval concepts of law, with a revindication of [[liberty]] not habitual in [[Europe]] of that time. The natural rights of man came to be, in one form or another, the center of attention, including rights as a corporeal being (right to life, economic rights such as the right to own property) and spiritual rights (the right to [[freedom of thought]] and to human dignity).

The School of Salamanca reformulated the concept of [[natural law]]: law originating in nature itself, with all that exists in the natural order sharing in this law. Their conclusion was, given that all humans share the same nature, they also share the same rights to life and liberty. Such views constituted a novelty in European thought and went counter to those then predominant in Spain and Europe that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|people indigenous to the Americas]] had no such rights.

==Sovereignty==
{{more footnotes|section|date=October 2011}}
The School of Valencia distinguished two realms of power, the natural or civil realm and the realm of the [[supernatural]], which were often conflated in the [[Middle Ages]] through granting royal control of [[Investiture controversy|investiture]] of bishops, or the temporal powers of the [[pope]]. One direct consequence of the separation of realms of power is that the king or emperor does not legitimately have jurisdiction over [[soul]]s, nor does the pope have legitimate [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]]. This included the proposal that there are limits on the legitimate powers of government. Thus, according to Luis de Molina a [[nation]] is [[analogous]] to a mercantile society (the antecedent of a modern [[corporation]]) in that those who govern are holders of power (effectively sovereigns) but a collective power, to which they are subject, derives from them jointly. Nonetheless, in de Molina's view, the power of society over the individual is greater than that of a mercantile society over its members, because the power of the government of a nation emanates from God's divine power (as against merely from the power of individuals [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] over themselves in their business dealings).
[[Image:Francisco vitoria.jpg|thumb|150px|right|''[[Francisco de Vitoria]]'']]
At this time, the [[monarchy]] of [[England]] was extending the theory of the [[divine right of kings]]—under which the monarch is the unique legitimate recipient of the emanation of God's power—asserting that [[subject (philosophy)|subjects]] must follow the monarch's orders, in order not to contravene said design. Counter to this, several adherents of the School sustained that the ''[[people]]'' are the vehicle of divine [[sovereignty]], which they, in turn, pass to a prince under various conditions. Possibly the one who went furthest in this direction was Francisco Suárez, whose work ''Defensio Fidei Catholicae adversus Anglicanae sectae errores'' (''The Defense of the Catholic Faith against the errors of the [[Anglican]] sect'' 1613) was the strongest defense in this period of [[popular sovereignty]]. Men are born free by their nature and not as slaves of another man, and can disobey even to the point of [[right of rebellion|deposing an unjust government]]. As with de Molina, he affirms that political power does not reside in any one concrete person, but he differs subtly in that he considers that the recipient of that power is the people as a whole, not a collection of sovereign individuals—in the same way, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s theory of popular sovereignty would consider the people as a collective group superior to the sum that composes it.

[[Gabriel Vázquez]] (1549–1604) held that natural law is not limited to the individual, but obliges societies to act in accord and be treated with justice.

For Suárez, the political power of society is contractual in origin because the community forms by [[consensus]] of free wills. The consequence of this [[social contract|contractualist theory]] is that the natural form of government is either a [[democracy]] or a republic, while [[oligarchy]] or [[monarchy]] arise as secondary institutions, whose claim to justice is based on being forms chosen (or at least consented to) by the people.

==The law of peoples and international law==
[[Image:Franciscus Suarez, S.I. (1548-1617).jpg|thumb|150px|right|''[[Francisco Suárez]]'']]
Francisco de Vitoria played an important role in the early modern comprehension of ''[[ius gentium]]'' (the rights of nations). He extrapolated his ideas of legitimate sovereign power to society at the international level, concluding that this scope as well ought to be ruled by just forms respecting the rights of all. The common good of the world is of a category superior to the good of each state. This meant that relations between states ought to pass from being justified by force to being justified by law and justice.

Francisco Suárez subdivided the concept of ''ius gentium''. Working with already well-formed categories, he carefully distinguished  ''[[jus inter gentes|ius inter gentes]]'' from ''ius intra gentes''. Ius inter gentes (which corresponds to modern international law) was something common to the majority of countries, although being [[positive law]], not natural law, was not necessarily universal. On the other hand, ''ius intra gentes'', or [[Private law|civil law]], is specific to each nation.

Some scholars have disputed the standard account of the origins of modern [[International law]] which emphasises the seminal text ''[[De iure belli ac pacis]]'' by [[Grotius]]. They have argued for the importance of Vitoria and Suárez as the forerunners and founders of the field.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. James Brown Scott, cited in Cavallar, The Rights of Strangers: theories of international hospitality, the global community, and political justice since Vitoria, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Martti Koskenniemi|Koskenniemi]], have argued that none of these humanist and scholastic thinkers can be understood to have founded international law in the modern sense, instead placing its origins in the post-1870 period.&lt;ref&gt;Koskenniemi: International Law and raison d'état: Rethinking the Prehistory of International Law in Kingsbury &amp; Strausmann, The Roman Foundations of the Law of Nations, pp. 297–339&lt;/ref&gt;

==Just war==
Given that war is one of the worst evils suffered by mankind, the adherents of the School reasoned that it ought to be resorted to only when it was necessary in order to prevent an even ''greater'' evil. A diplomatic agreement is preferable, even for the more powerful party, before a war is started. &lt;!-- the point being that obviously the weaker party would be happier with a diplomatic solution, while the stronger might need a bit more encouragement to accept a diplomatic solution --&gt; Examples of "[[The Just War tradition|just war]]" are:
* In self-defense, as long as there is a reasonable possibility of success. If failure is a foregone conclusion, then it is just a wasteful spilling of blood.
* Preventive war against a [[tyranny|tyrant]] who is about to attack.
* War to punish a guilty enemy.

A war is not legitimate or illegitimate simply based on its original motivation: it must comply with a series of additional requirements:
* It is necessary that the response be commensurate with the evil; use of more violence than is strictly necessary would constitute an unjust war.
* Governing authorities ''declare'' war, but their decision is not sufficient cause to begin a war. If the ''people'' oppose a war, then it is illegitimate. The people have a right to depose a government that is waging, or is about to wage, an unjust war.
* Once war has begun, there remain moral limits to action. For example, one may not attack innocents or kill hostages.
* It is obligatory to take advantage of all options for dialogue and negotiations before undertaking a war; war is only legitimate as a last resort.

Under this doctrine, expansionist wars, wars of pillage, wars to convert [[infidel]]s or [[paganism|pagans]], and wars for glory are all inherently unjust.

==The conquest of America==
In this period, in which [[colonialism|European colonialism]] began, Spain was the only western European nation in which a group of intellectuals questioned the legitimacy of conquest rather than simply trying to justify it by traditional means.

Francisco de Vitoria began his analysis of conquest by rejecting "illegitimate titles". He was the first to dare to question whether the [[papal bull|bulls]] of [[Alexander VI]] known collectively as the ''[[Bulls of Donation]]'' were a valid title of dominion over the newly discovered territories. In this matter he did not accept the universal primacy of the emperor, the authority of the pope (because the pope, according to him, lacked temporal power), nor the claim of voluntary submission or conversion of the Native Americans. One could not consider them [[sin]]ners or lacking in [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]]: they were free people by nature, with legitimate property rights. When the Spanish arrived in America they brought no legitimate title to occupy those lands and become their master.

Vitoria also analyzed whether there were legitimate claims of title over discovered lands. He elaborated up to eight legitimate titles of dominion. The first and perhaps most fundamental relates to communication between people, who jointly constitute a universal society. ''Ius peregrinandi et degendi'' is the right of every human being to travel and do commerce in all parts of the earth, independently of who governs or what is the religion of the territory. For him, if the "Indians" of the Americas would not permit free transit, the aggrieved parties had the right to defend themselves and to remain in land obtained in such a war of self-defense.

The second form of legitimate title over discovered lands also referred back to a human right whose obstruction is a cause for a just war. The Indians could voluntarily refuse conversion, but could not impede the right of the Spanish to preach, in which case the matter would be analogous to the first case. Nonetheless, Vitoria noted that although this can be grounds for a just war, it is not necessarily appropriate to make such a war, because of the resulting death and destruction.

The other cases of this [[casuistry]] are:
* If the pagan sovereigns force converts to return to [[idolatry]].
* If there come to be a sufficient number of Christians in the newly discovered land that they wish to receive from the Pope a Christian government.
* In the case of overthrowing a tyranny or a government that is harming innocents (e.g. [[human sacrifice]])
* If associates and friends have been attacked—as were the [[Tlaxcala|Tlaxcaltecas]], allied with the Spanish but subjected, like many other people, to the [[Aztecs]]—once again, this could justify a war, with the ensuing possibility of legitimate conquest as in the first case.
* The final "legitimate title" although qualified by Vitoria himself as doubtful, is the lack of just laws, magistrates, agricultural techniques, etc. In any case, title taken according to this principle must be exercised with Christian charity and for the advantage of the Indians.

This doctrine of "legitimate" and "illegitimate" titles was not agreeable to Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], then ruler of Spain, in that they meant that Spain had no special right; he tried without success to stop these theologians from expressing their opinions in these matters.

==Economics==
{{more footnotes|section|date=October 2011}}
Much attention has been drawn to the economic thought of the School of Salamanca by [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954). It did not coin, but certainly consolidated, the use of the term School of Salamanca in economics. Schumpeter studied [[scholasticism|scholastic]] doctrine in general and Spanish scholastic doctrine in particular, and praised the high level of economic science in Spain in the 16th century. He argued that the School of Salamanca most deserve to be considered the founders of economics as a science. The School did not elaborate a complete doctrine of economics, but they established the first modern economic theories to address the new economic problems that had arisen with the end of the medieval order. Unfortunately, there was no continuation of their work until the end of the 17th century and many of their contributions were forgotten, only to be rediscovered later by others.

The English historian of economic thought [[Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson]] has published numerous articles and monographs on the School of Salamanca.

Although there does not appear to be any direct influence, the economic thought of the School of Salamanca is in many ways similar to that of the [[Austrian School]]. [[Murray Rothbard]] referred to them as ''proto-Austrians''.

===Antecedents===
[[Image:El Greco - Portrait of Diego de Covarrubias y Leiva - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|150px|right|''[[Diego de Covarrubias]]'']]
In 1517, de Vitoria, then at the [[College of Sorbonne|Sorbonne]], was consulted by Spanish merchants based in [[Antwerp]] about the moral legitimacy of engaging in commerce to increase one's personal wealth. From today's point of view, one would say they were asking for a consultation about the [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] spirit. Beginning at that time, Vitoria and other theologians looked at economic matters. They moved away from views that they found to be obsolete, adopting instead new ideas based on principles of natural law.

According to these views, the natural order is based in the "freedom of circulation" of people, goods, and ideas, allowing people to know one another and increase their sentiments of brotherhood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} This implies that merchantry is not merely not reprehensible, but that it actually serves the general good.

===Private property===
The adherents of the School of Valencia all agreed that property has the beneficial effect of stimulating economic activity, which, in turn, contributed to the general well being. [[Diego de Covarubias y Leyva]] (1512–1577) considered that people had not only the right to own property but—again, a specifically modern idea—they had the exclusive right to the benefit from that property, although the community might also benefit. Nonetheless, in times of great necessity, there all goods become a [[commons]].

Luis de Molina argued that individual owners take better care of their goods than is taken of common property, a form of the [[tragedy of the commons]].

=== Money, value, and price ===
[[Image:Flickr - Yale Law Library - Martín de Azpilcueta (1492^-1586).jpg|thumb|150px|right|''[[Martín de Azpilcueta]]'']]
The most complete and methodical developments of a Salamancan theory of value were by [[Martín de Azpilcueta]] (1493–1586) and [[Luis de Molina]]. Interested in the effect of [[precious metals]] arriving from the Americas, de [[Martín de Azpilcueta|Azpilcueta]] proved that in the countries where precious metals were scarce, prices for them were higher than in those where they were abundant. Precious metals, like any other mercantile good, gained at least some of their value from their scarcity. This scarcity theory of value was a precursor of the quantitative theory of money put forward slightly later by [[Jean Bodin]] (1530–1596).

Up until that time, the predominant theory of value had been the medieval theory based on the cost of production as the sole determinant of a [[just price]] (a variant of the [[cost-of-production theory of value]], most recently manifested in the [[labor theory of value]]). [[Diego de Covarubias y Leyva|Diego de Covarrubias]] and [[Luis de Molina]] developed a [[subjective theory of value]] and prices, which asserted that the usefulness of a good varied from person to person, so just prices would arise from mutual decisions in free commerce, barring the distorting effects of [[monopoly]], fraud, or government intervention. Expressing this in today's terms, the adherents of the School defended the [[free market]], where the fair price of a good would be determined by [[supply and demand]].

On this [[Luis Saravia de la Calle]] wrote in 1544:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who measure the just price by the labour, costs, and risk incurred by the person who deals in the merchandise or produces it, or by the cost of transport or the expense of traveling...or by what he has to pay the factors for their industry, risk, and labour, are greatly in error.... For the just price arises from the abundance or scarcity of goods, merchants, and money...and not from costs, labour, and risk.... Why should a bale of linen brought overland from Brittany at great expense be worth more than one which is transported cheaply by sea?... Why should a book written out by hand be worth more than one which is printed, when the latter is better though it costs less to produce?... The just price is found not by counting the cost but by the common estimation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However the school rarely followed this idea through systematically, and, as [[Friedrich Hayek]] has written, "never to the point of realizing that what was relevant was not merely man's relation to a particular thing or a class of things but the position of the thing in the whole...scheme by which men decide how to allocate the resources at their disposal among their different endeavors."&lt;ref name="Hayek"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek |first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich von Hayek| title=The Fortunes of Liberalism: Essays on Austrian Economics and the Ideal of Freedom| chapter=The Austrian School of Economics| publisher=University of Chicago Press| location=Chicago| year=1992| page=43| isbn=0-226-32064-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AACwJ68vBukC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interest on money===
[[Usury]] (which in that period meant ''any'' charging of [[interest]] on a [[loan]]) has always been viewed negatively by the Catholic Church. The [[Third Lateran Council]] condemned any repayment of a debt with more money than was originally loaned; the [[Council of Vienne]] explicitly prohibited usury and declared any legislation tolerant of usury to be heretical; the first scholastics reproved the charging of interest. In the [[medieval economy]], loans were entirely a consequence of necessity (bad harvests, fire in a workplace) and, under those conditions, it was considered morally reproachable to charge interest.

In the [[Renaissance]] era, greater mobility of people facilitated an increase in commerce and the appearance of appropriate conditions for [[entrepreneur]]s to start new, lucrative businesses. Given that borrowed money was no longer strictly for consumption but for production as well, it could not be viewed in the same manner. The School of Salamanca elaborated various reasons that justified the charging of interest. The person who received a loan benefited; one could consider interest as a premium paid for the risk taken by the loaning party. There was also the question of [[opportunity cost]], in that the loaning party lost other possibilities of utilizing the loaned money. Finally, and perhaps most originally, was the consideration of ''money itself'' as a merchandise, and the use of one's money as something for which one should receive a benefit in the form of interest.

Martín de Azpilcueta also considered the effect of time, formulating the [[time value of money]]. All things being equal, one would prefer to receive a given good now rather than in the future. This [[time preference|preference]] indicates greater value. Interest, under this theory, is the payment for the time the loaning individual is deprived of the money.

==Theology==
{{more footnotes|section|date=October 2011}}
In the Renaissance era, theology was generally declining {{citation needed|date=October 2018}} in the face of the rise of [[humanism]], with [[scholasticism]] becoming nothing more than an empty and routine methodology {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}. Under Francisco de Vitoria, the [[University of Salamanca]] led a period of intense activity in theology, especially a renaissance of [[Thomism]], whose influence extended to European culture in general, but especially to other European universities. Perhaps the fundamental contribution of the School of Salamanca to theology is the study of problems much closer to humanity, which had previously been ignored, and the opening of questions that had previously not been posed. The term ''positive theology'' is sometimes used to distinguish this new, more practical, theology from the earlier ''scholastic theology''.

===Morality===
In an era when [[religion]] permeated everything, to analyze the morality of the acts was considered the most practical and useful study one could undertake to serve society. The novel contributions of the School in law and economics were rooted in concrete challenges and moral problems which confronted society under new conditions.

[[Image:Retrato de Fray Luis de León.jpg|thumb|150px|right|''Fray [[Luis de León]]'']]
Over the years a [[casuistry]], a fixed set of answers to moral dilemmas, had been developed. However, by its nature, a casuistry can never be complete, leading to a search for more general rules or principles. From this developed [[Probabilism]], where the ultimate criterion was not truth, but the certainty of not choosing evil. Developed principally by [[Bartolomé de Medina]] and continued by [[Gabriel Vásquez|Gabriel Vázquez]] and Francisco Suárez, Probabilism became the most important school of moral thought in the coming centuries.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

=== The polemic ''De auxiliis'' ===
[[Image:Molina - De Justitia et jure, 1759 - 272.tif|thumb|150px|right|''[[Luis de Molina]]'']]
The polemic ''[[Congregatio de Auxiliis|De auxiliis]]'' was a dispute between Jesuits and Dominicans which occurred at the end of the 16th century. The topic of the controversy was [[divine grace|grace]] and [[predestination]], that is to say how one could reconcile the [[liberty]] or [[free will]] of humans with divine [[omniscience]]. In 1582 the Jesuit [[Prudencio Montemayor]] and Fray [[Luis de León]] spoke publicly about human liberty. [[Domingo Báñez]] considered that they gave free will too great a weight and that they used terminology that sounded [[heresy|heretical]]; he denounced them to the [[Spanish Inquisition]], accusing them of [[Pelagianism]], a belief in human free will to the detriment of the doctrine of [[original sin]] and the grace granted by God. Montemayor and de León were banned from teaching and prohibited from defending such ideas.

Báñez was then denounced to the Holy Office by Leon, who accused him of "committing the error of Lutheranism", that is of following the doctrines of [[Martin Luther]]. According to Lutheran doctrine, man is "dead in his trespasses" (Ephesians 2:1) as a consequence of original sin and cannot save himself by his own merit; only God can save man, "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast." (Ephesians 2:8-9) Báñez was acquitted.

Nonetheless, this did not end the dispute, which [[Luis de Molina]] continued with his ''Concordia liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis'' (1588). This is considered the best expression of the Jesuit position. The polemic continued over the course of years, including an attempt by the Dominicans to get [[Pope Clement VIII]] to condemn the ''Concordia'' of de Molina. Finally [[Paul V]] in 1607 recognized the liberty of Dominicans and Jesuits to defend their ideas, prohibiting that either side of this disagreement be characterized as heresy.

===The existence of evil in the world===
The existence of evil in a world created and ruled by an infinitely good and powerful God has long been viewed as paradoxical. (See [[Problem of evil]]). Vitoria reconciled the paradox by arguing first that free will is a gift from God to each person. It is impossible that each person will always freely choose only the good. Thus, evil results as a necessary consequence of human free will.

== The School of Salamanca online course ==
In April 2018, [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] offers a massive open online course ([[Massive open online course|MOOC]]) [https://salamanca.ufm.edu/ The School of Salamanca] about the origins of the Hispanic liberal tradition as well as the scope of its fundamental influence on modern [[Western culture|Western Civilization]]. An overview of the School of Salamanca, the main intellectual current of early modern [[Spain]]. The online course consists of three main chapters on the school's contributions to Human Rights, Politics, and Economics, plus an introduction, a conclusion, and brief chapters on the school's founder [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and its climactic figure [[Juan de Mariana]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4655">'''Spánverjavígin''' also known as the '''"Spanish Killings"''' or '''"Slaying of the Spaniards"''' was the last documented [[massacre]] in [[History of Iceland|Icelandic history]]. Some [[History of Basque whaling|Basque whalers]] went on a whaling expedition to Iceland and were killed after conflict in 1615 with local people in the region of the [[Westfjords]].

==Background==
In the first half of the sixteenth century [[Basque people|Basque]] whalers set up the world's first large-scale whaling industry in [[Labrador|Terra Nova]]. The center of this industry was some ten ports on the southern coast of [[Labrador]]. During the peak years of the 1560s and 1570s the fleet comprised around 30 ships manned by up to 2,000 men, who killed in the region 400 whales each year. By the beginning of the seventeenth century Basque whaling had reached Iceland.

==Massacre==
[[File:Vestfirðir.png|thumb|The [[Westfjords]]]]
The year 1615 was a difficult year in [[Iceland]] with ice up to shores until late summer and considerable loss of livestock. In mid-summer three Basque whaling vessels put into Reykjarfjörður in [[Westfjords]]. Icelanders and the Basques had a mutual agreement at the beginning as they both had benefited from the enterprise. When the ships were ready for departure in late September a terrible gale arose and the ships were driven on the rocks and crushed. Most of the crew members survived (approx. 80). The captains Pedro de Aguirre and Esteban de Telleria wintered at [[Vatneyri]] ([[Patreksfjörður]]) and left for home the following year. The crew of Martin de Villafranca's ship split into two groups; one entered [[Ísafjarðardjúp]], the other went to [[Bolungarvík]] and later to [[Þingeyri]].

The first conflict arose when one group entered the empty house of a merchant of [[Þingeyri]] and stole some dried fish.
As retaliation, on 5 October, at night, a group of Icelanders entered the hut where the Basques were sleeping and killed 14 of them, only one young man called García, escaped. 
Captain  Martín de Villafranca of [[San Sebastián]], whose father and grandfather had both been involved in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Terra Nova]] whaling was among those who were killed.
The bodies were mutilated and sunken into water. [[Jón Guðmundsson the Learned]] wrote about the unjust and cruel deaths "dishonored  and sunken into sea, as if they were the worst pagans and not innocent Christians".
Three days after the first slaying, [[Ari Magnússon]] summoned a council at [[Súðavík]] and twelve judges agreed to declare as outlaws all the Basques.

On 13 October Martin and the other 17 of his group were killed at Æðey and Sandeyri in [[Ísafjarðardjúp]], while they were fishing by the troops commanded by Ari Magnússon.
According to Jón Guðmundsson, the victims were stabbed in the eyes, their ears, noses and had their genitals mutilated.
The captain, [[Martín de Villafranca]],  was injured in the shoulder and chest with an axe, but he managed to escape into the sea however he was stoned in the water and dragged to the shore where he was tortured to death.

Two verdicts were instigated by sheriff Ari Magnússon of [[Ögur, Ísafjarðardjúp]] in October 1615 and January 1616. The Basques were considered criminals after their ships were wrecked and in accordance with the [[Jónsbók|Icelandic law book of 1281]] it was decided that the only right thing to do was to kill as many of them as possible.

==Account of Jón the Learned==
[[Jón lærði Guðmundsson|Jón Guðmundsson the Learned]] (1574–1658) wrote a critical account condemning the decision of the local sheriff to order the killings: ''Sönn frásaga af spanskra manna skipbrotum og slagi'' (A True Account of Spanish Men's Shipwrecks and Slayings). Jón says that they were unjustly killed; not wishing to take part in an attack on them, he fled south to [[Snæfellsnes]].

The '''Talking Gravestones''' ({{lang-de|Sprechende Grabsteine}}) of Föhr, also known as the '''Story-telling Gravestones''' (''Erzählende Grabsteine''), are historic artifacts on the German island of [[Föhr]]. They can be found in the cemeteries of St. Laurentii church in [[Süderende]] {{nowrap|({{coord|54.7163|8.4352|type:landmark_region:DE|display=inline|name=St. Laurentii, Süderende}}),}} St. Johannes church in [[Nieblum]] {{nowrap|({{coord|54.6934|8.4911|type:landmark_region:DE|display=inline|name=St. Johannes, Nieblum}}),}} and St. Nikolai church in Boldixum {{nowrap|({{coord|54.6958|8.5504|type:landmark_region:DE|display=inline|name=St. Nikolai, Boldixum}}),}} which is now a district of [[Wyk auf Föhr]]. [[Talking Gravestones of Amrum|Similar objects]] are known from the neighbour island of [[Amrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-58138761.html |language=German |first=Matthias |last=Schulz |title=Kostbares Gedächtnis |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |issue=29 |year=2008 |accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All such headstones made until 1870 are designated [[cultural heritage monument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/DE/Landesregierung/LD/Kulturdenkmale/ListeKulturdenkmale/_documents/Aktuelle_ListeKulturdenkmale.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2 |title=Verzeichnis der Kulturdenkmale (bis 30.1.2015) |language=German |publisher=Landesamt für Denkmalpflege |accessdate=12 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305002626/http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/DE/Landesregierung/LD/Kulturdenkmale/ListeKulturdenkmale/_documents/Aktuelle_ListeKulturdenkmale.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2 |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their inscriptions tell the biographies of the deceased including their private and professional lives, extraordinary events, and honorary appointments.&lt;ref name="SL parish"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.st-laurentii.de/der-friedhof/ |title=Der Friedhof |language=German |publisher=St. Laurentii Congregation, Föhr |accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 265 monuments, the St. Johannis cemetery has the largest inventory of historical gravestones in [[Nordfriesland district]].&lt;ref name="SJ parish"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.friesendom.de/Friesendom/alte-Grabsteine/ |title=Die alten Grabsteine auf dem Kirchhof von St. Johannis |language=German |work=Friesendom |publisher=St. Johannis Evangelical Lutheran Congration |accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known tombstone is the one of [[Matthias Petersen]] who was a very successful whaling captain and was therefore dubbed "Lucky Matthew" (''der glückliche Matthias'').&lt;ref name="NF Tageblatt"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.shz.de/lokales/nordfriesland-tageblatt/das-raetsel-der-sprechenden-steine-id110457.html |title=Das Rätsel der sprechenden Steine |language=German |work=Nordfriesland Tageblatt |date=30 January 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only ornamental decoration on this stone is a circular [[relief]] depicting the [[Fortuna|goddess of fortune]] upon a swimming whale in the style of a coat of arms. It features the only inscription completely in [[Latin language]] in the cemetery of Süderende, which relates that Petersen who died in 1706 caught 373 whales during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/hamburg/article1839603/Sprechende-Grabsteine-erzaehlen-vom-Walfang.html |title=Sprechende Grabsteine erzählen vom Walfang |first=Jenny |last=Tobien |work=[[Die Welt]] |date=26 March 2008 |accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the material==
The oldest Talking Gravestones where made from slabs of red [[sandstone]] that originates from the [[Solling]] hills in northern [[Westphalia]].&lt;ref name="Inseltouristik"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inseltouristik.de/schleswig-holstein-nordfriesland-nordsee-wattenmeer-foehr-nieblum-kirche.html |title=St. Johannis Kirche in Nieblum auf Föhr |language=German |work=Inseltouristik |accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later tombstones measure roughly {{convert|160|by|70|cm}}. Most gravestones were made from sandstone quarried in [[Obernkirchen]], [[Lower Saxony]]. Shipmasters used to take the stones on board as [[ballast]]. Only wealthy people from Föhr could afford totally new monuments while poor persons would have to grind off old slabs to add a new design.&lt;ref name="NF Tageblatt"/&gt; Sometimes also test objects from a stonemason's workshop may have been erected in the cemetery. This theory is supported by specific letters and the word ''ALVABET'' on the backside of one headstone.&lt;ref name="Inseltouristik"/&gt;

==Stonemasons==
Apart from a few great tomb plates that were likely created by foreign, professional stonemasons, all Talking Gravestones were made locally by the island population. At first it may have been Dutch wood carvers from the mainland that were hired to decorate the gravestones, until ship carpenters had obtained the skills of stonemasonry and got orders from the neighbouring islands and Föhr proper to create gravestones.&lt;ref name="Land &amp; Meer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landundmeer.de/Artikel/4799/Sprechende-Steine.html |title=Sprechende Steine |first=Renate |last=Preuss |work=Land &amp; Meer |language=German |accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the decorations is sometimes very intricate, so that the process of creation took a long time. As a result, many gravestones could only be erected several years after the burial of the deceased person.&lt;ref name="NF Tageblatt"/&gt;

==Language and symbolism==
[[File:Grabstein 04-07-2004-0009.JPG|thumb|The tombstone of a husband and wife in the cemetery of Süderende]]
[[File:Nieblum_Friedhof.jpg|thumb|The cemetery of Nieblum]]
[[File:Kulturdenkmaeler Wyk Boldixum (Grabmale) 006 2016 05 31.jpg|thumb|The cemetery of Boldixum]]
The texts on most gravestones are exclusively written in the "noble" church language of [[Standard German]] (''Hochdeutsch'')&lt;ref name="Land &amp; Meer"/&gt; although the island then used to belong to Denmark and the everyday-language was [[Fering]], a local dialect of the [[North Frisian language]] which is still spoken today. A few stones exhibit texts in [[Low German]] which used to be the official and ecclesiastical language until around 1700, while other texts are written in Latin. Some 20th-century tombstones have inscriptions in Fering.&lt;ref name="SL parish"/&gt; In order to tell the long biographies on the limited space of the stone slab, the stonemasons sometimes used abbreviations:&lt;ref name="Inseltouristik"/&gt;

*''J.S.G.G.S.'' = ''Ihren Seelen Gott gnädig sei'' [May God have mercy upon their souls]
*''D.S.G.G.S.'' = ''Deren Seelen Gott gnädig sei'' [On whose souls God may have mercy]
*''I.S.S.G.G.'' = ''Ihrer Seele sei Gott gnädig'' [On whose soul God may have mercy]
*''D.S.G.G.I.'' = ''Deren Seelen Gott gnädig ist'' [On whose souls God has mercy]
*''G.S.S.S.G.'' = ''Gott sei seiner Seele gnädig''  [May God have mercy upon his soul].

The relief decorations are kept in [[baroque]] and [[rococo]] style. They are often detailed and fantastic with unique forms that are not repeated. The images may show "angels as symbols of justice, happiness, and a sign of faith, love and hope, but also ships, windmills and the family tree are shown".&lt;ref name="SL parish"/&gt; Scenes from the Bible are often the main motive of the ornaments on a stone. When a seafarer died on his ship, the ship is depicted with full sails while unrigged ships mean that the sailor died on land. Other popular motives are items from the deceased person's daily trade but also [[Lady Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Darstellungen der Justitia auf Grabsteinen des Friedhofs von St. Johannis in Nieblum / Föhr |first=Siegfried |last=Anger |work=Nordfriesisches Jahrbuch Neue Folge |language=German |year=1999 |volume=35 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special iconographic tradition can be found in the floral motives: the husband and the sons of a family are depicted on the left-hand side of the image as [[tulip]]-like flowers whereas the wife and daughters are shown on the right-hand side as star-shaped flowers with four petals.&lt;ref name="Inseltouristik"/&gt; A broken stalk is a sign that the respective person was already dead when the tombstone was created.&lt;ref name="Land &amp; Meer"/&gt; The frequency of broken flowers attests a high rate of [[infant mortality]].&lt;ref name="Inseltouristik"/&gt;

==History==
The oldest gravestones were made of sandstone slabs. To put them up in a slanted position, a hole was drilled through the stone so a wooden staff or a whale bone could support the stone.&lt;ref name="SL parish"/&gt; In later times, largers stones became popular that were called 'Bremen stones' according to their origin.&lt;ref name="Inseltouristik"/&gt; The oldest Talking Gravestone dates back to the year 1605.&lt;ref name="NF Tageblatt" /&gt; After 1700, the income of the population increased rapidly. because from the 17th to the 19th century, seafarers from Föhr including a number of captains pursued [[history of whaling|whaling]] and merchant shipping. In these times, upright tombstones were used more often. [[Stele]]s were introduced in the 18th century. When they were erected, they were mostly decorated with a coloured ornament on top, the section below would relate the biography of the deceased, and at the bottom would often be a Biblical verse or another image. When old stones were grinded off, the original top decoration often remained intact.&lt;ref name="Inseltouristik"/&gt;

The early 19th century marked the decline of this type of gravestones. [[Classicist architecture|Classicist]] monuments became increasingly popular which refrained from displaying images and extended biographies.&lt;ref name="Inseltouristik"/&gt; In the mid-19th century, this special form of burial culture had become totally uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Amrum. Landschaft, Geschichte, Natur |language=German |first=Georg |last=Quedens |authorlink=Georg Quedens |first2=Hans |last2=Hingst |first3=Gerhard |last3=Stück |first4=Ommo |last4=Wilts |year=1991 |location=Amrum |publisher=Verlag Jens Quedens |page=110 |isbn=3-924422-24-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, polished slabs of [[granite]] that only display the name and vital statistics of the deceased are usually found on Föhr and other North Frisian islands.&lt;ref name="Inseltouristik"/&gt;

{{coord|51|26|48.30|N|0|19|26.50|W|display=title}}

'''''The Naked Ladies''''' are a statue complex on a [[Rock garden|rockery]] and water cascade in the gardens of [[York House, Twickenham]], in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]], England. The larger than human size statues depict eight [[Oceanids]] and a pair of aquatic horses. They were carved in the [[fin de siècle]] style from white [[Carrara marble]] and probably came from Italy in the late nineteenth century or very early twentieth century. Originally they were part of a larger set of statues that was subdivided after the suicide of the initial purchaser.

After a somewhat unpromising start, they were installed in their current location without the benefit of the original design for their display. The statues spent several years as the backdrop for some of London's grandest garden parties. They subsequently passed by default into public ownership, and suffered some vandalism, but have been restored and remain to this day on view in the corner of a municipal garden.

== Design ==
[[File:Naked Ladies - view from the bridge.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Colour photograph, zoom shot through trees of two nude female statues on a rockery, one sitting, the other in a strange pose|The statues were installed without benefit of instruction from the designer as he spoke no English.]]
[[File:Lady with Pearl.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Colour photograph, rear view of marble statue of lady holding a pearl.|Another suggested name for the statues was the Pearl Fishers, but today only one lady still has a pearl.]]
[[File:York House statues 4 ladies detail.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Colour photograph of rockery from the side showing three ladies facing forward and up with their right hands raised|Side view of ladies in unusual poses]]
The statues are of Italian design, and come from [[Carrara]]. They are of a monumental scale with several of the individual blocks weighing over {{convert|5|LT|t|sigfig=1|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name="TM"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Statues at York House | url = http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/detail.asp?ContentID=11 | publisher = [[Twickenham Museum]] | accessdate = 3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculptures were acquired during the disposal of the property of the original owner after his death. Due to the unusual circumstances of their acquisition they had become separated from any instructions as to their intended layout, and also from at least one other group of statues in what was originally intended to be a larger statue complex or complexes.

The rockery was designed and the whole complex installed by the British company of [[J Cheal &amp; Sons]] who had to make their own interpretation as to the intended layout of the statues.&lt;ref name="TM" /&gt; Though they were able to incorporate all the statues into one tableaux, their interpretation of the sculptor's intended design has led to comments about the unusual poses of some of the statues, especially when viewed from the side.

Originally some of the ladies were holding pearls, but much of this detail has now been lost. There have been various theories as to the intended subject matter, with Pearl Fishers, [[Pegasus]], [[Naiads]] and [[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|the birth of Venus]] all having been suggested in addition to the usual attribution as [[Oceanides]]. For want of anything more official, they have become known as ''The Naked Ladies''.&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite book | title = Twickenham Past | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_wRHAAAACAAJ | isbn = 0-948667-22-2 | publisher = Historical Publications | year = 1993 | page = 139 | last1 = Simpson | first1 =  Donald | first2 = Borough of Twickenham Local History Society  | accessdate = 13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setting ==
[[File:Vista York House gardens.jpg|thumb|alt=The colour photograph presents a series of lawns leading up to a statue complex. Hedges partially divide these lawns into three sections.

The complex is in the gardens of York House by the banks of the [[River Thames]]. The gardens have been laid out in an Italian style to give unrestricted frontal views of the statue complex from the entire width of the gardens. The statues are set in a rockery behind a pond, with trees and security fencing restricting side and rear views.

The statues were amongst the property of the celebrated fraudster [[Whitaker Wright]], who committed suicide by ingestion of a cyanide capsule upon being convicted of fraud. It is not certain where he acquired the statues, or who carved them. After his death much of his collection was sold from [[Witley Park]], including ''the Naked Ladies'' and also some mounted nymphs of a similar style, which went to [[Beale Park]]; one of the latter bore the mark "O SPALMACH, STUDIO O ANDREONI, ROMA."&lt;ref name="TM2"&gt;{{cite web | last = Payan | first = J | title = The Statues in York House Gardens Twickenham | url = http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/paper.asp?PaperID=1 | date = 9 September 1995 | work =  | publisher = Twickenham Museum | accessdate = 3 July 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028173654/http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/paper.asp?PaperID=1 | archivedate = 28 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; identifying the studio of the Roman sculptor [[Orazio Andreoni]], so it is possible that they were all sculpted there by [[Oscar Spalmach]].

=== Sir Ratan Tata ===
The statues were acquired from Witley Park and brought to their current location by Sir [[Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata]].&lt;ref name="TM" /&gt; Sir Ratan had bought York House from the [[Philippe d'Orléans (1869-1926)|duc d'Orléans]] in 1906, and by the end of 1909 he had had the Riverside gardens redesigned in the Italian style and the statues installed.

Sir Ratan was for several years a noted host for London High Society, with [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] among the guests at his garden parties.

=== Twickenham Council ===
The statues came into the ''de facto'' possession of [[Municipal Borough of Twickenham|Twickenham Council]] in 1924 when they purchased York House for their new town hall. The statues had been left behind by the previous owners, as they had been unable to find a buyer despite putting them up for auction.&lt;ref name="TM2" /&gt;

=== Hiding the statues in the Blitz ===
In [[the Blitz]] during the Second World War, there was concern that moonlight reflecting on the statues would give a navigation mark to the [[Luftwaffe]]. So as part of London's [[Blackout (wartime)|Blackout]] measures the statues were covered with a "grey sludge".&lt;ref name="TM2" /&gt;

=== Modern times ===
As a result of local government reorganisation in the 1960s Twickenham became part of the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]], but the town hall remains at York House and the gardens continue to be open to the public. The statues have gone through at least one major restoration to remove graffiti and the wartime grey cement, and reverse the effects of vandalism by replacing lost fingers, pearls and even a hoof.&lt;ref name="HP" /&gt; In 1983 the statues were protected with a [[Grade II]] listing by English Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1250324 Historic England retrieved 24th Sept 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:passover plot.JPG|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]])]]

'''''The Passover Plot''''' is a 1965 [[conspiracy theory]] book &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schonfield |first=Hugh Joseph |authorlink=Hugh J. Schonfield |title=The Passover Plot: a New Interpretation of the Life and Death of Jesus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rrhk5B3AQocC |format=snippets view |accessdate= |year=1965 |edition=1996 reprint |publisher=Element |location= |isbn=9781852308360 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by British [[Bible|biblical]] scholar [[Hugh J. Schonfield]], who also published a translation of the [[New Testament]] with a Jewish perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tyndalearchive.com/scriptures/ONT.htm ''The Original New Testament''] (originally published in 1958 as ''The Authentic New Testament'', updated and re-published under this title in 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The book was adapted into a film, ''[[The Passover Plot (film)|The Passover Plot]]'' (1976).

==Schonfield's conclusions==
Based on his research into the social and religious culture in which [[Jesus]] was born, lived and died, and into other literature, including the source documents of the [[Gospel]]s, Schonfield reached the following conclusions:
* That Jesus was a deeply religious [[Jew]]ish man, probably well-versed in the teachings of the local northern sects such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]s and [[Essenes]].
* That growing up in biblical [[Galilee]] he had a skeptical and somewhat rebellious relationship to the hierarchy and teachings mandated by the authorities (the [[Saducee]]s) of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]].
* That Jewish [[Messiah|Messianic]] expectation was extremely high in those times, matched to the despair caused by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation of the land and subjugation of the Jews.
* That he was in many ways both typical of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|his times]], and yet extraordinary in his religious convictions and beliefs, in his scholarship of the biblical literature, and in the fervency in which he lived his religion out in his daily life.
* That he was convinced of his role as the expected Messiah based on the authority of his having been descendant from [[David|King David]] (the [[Davidic line|royal bloodline of David]]), and that he consciously and methodically, to the point of being calculating, attempted to fulfill that role, being eminently well-versed in the details of what that role entailed.
* That he was convinced of the importance of his fulfilling the role perfectly (after all prophesy and expectation), and that he could not allow himself to fail, as that would undoubtedly lead to his being declared a [[False messiah|false Messiah]].
* That he was perfectly aware of the consequences of his actions all along the way, and that he directed his closest supporters, the original twelve [[Apostles]], unknowingly to aid him in his plans.
* That he involved the least possible number of supporters in his plans ("[[need to know]]" basis), therefore very few knew of the details of his final plan, and even then only the least amount of information necessary.&lt;ref name="Schaefer2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry F. Schaefer|title=Science and Christianity: Conflict Or Coherence?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g67eEE-t5TIC&amp;pg=PA164|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=1 July 2003|publisher=The Apollos Trust|isbn=978-0-9742975-0-7|pages=164–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culmination of his plan was to be his death (the [[crucifixion]]), his [[resurrection]] and his reign as the true kingly and priestly messiah, not in heaven but on earth—the realized king of the Jews.

==Planning==
According to Schonfield's analysis, the events of the Passover, which are presented in all the Gospels, but inconsistently, are most accurately presented in the Gospel of John. His reading of that Gospel convinced him that John's account, though probably filtered through an assistant and transcription in John's old age, suggests that Jesus had planned everything. Among other things, so that he would not be on the cross for more than a few hours before the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] arrived when it was required by law that Jews be taken down, so that one of his supporters, who was on hand, would give him water (to quench his thirst) that was actually laced with a drug to make him unconscious, and so that [[Joseph of Arimathea]], a well-connected supporter, would collect him off the cross while still alive (but appearing dead) so that he could be secretly nursed back to health. Schonfield suggests that the plan went awry because of a soldier's actions with a spear. Schonfield gives evidence of a high-ranking member of the Sanhedrin who was one of Jesus' followers, likely the [[Beloved Disciple]] who is otherwise obscure, and notes several instances in which knowledge of or access to the Temple was available to one or more of Jesus' followers. He identifies this follower as John, the source of the Gospel many decades later whilst living in Asia Minor. He suggests that this Apostle, and Joseph of Arimathea, were responsible for events following the Crucifixion, and that it might have been this Apostle (an 'undercover Disciple', as it were) who was seen (by those who did not know him) at the Tomb on the morning of the Resurrection.&lt;ref name="Habermas1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary R. Habermas|title=The Historical Jesus: Ancient Evidence for the Life of Christ|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pMMeqKHZIDkC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=1 June 1996|publisher=College Press|isbn=978-0-89900-732-8|pages=70–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second half of the book==
After first laying out the storyline and outcome of Jesus' life in the first half of the book, along with supportive arguments, Schonfield devotes the second half of the book to a more detailed explanation of the concepts and arguments used to support his conclusions.  Schonfield also discusses how Jesus' original message and purpose may have become transformed during the century after his death.

==Film based on book==
{{Main article|The Passover Plot (film)}}
''[[The Passover Plot (film)|The Passover Plot]]'' is the name of a 1976 film which was adapted from this book.  The movie starred [[Zalman King]] as ''Yeshua'' ([[Jesus]]), and the cast included [[Harry Andrews]], [[Dan Hedaya]], and [[Donald Pleasence]].  It was directed by [[Michael Campus]] and nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Best Costume Design. Schonfield also featured in the dramatised documentary television series, ''Jesus: The Evidence'' (1984: LWT for Channel 4).

This is a '''timeline of actions by the [[Real Irish Republican Army]]''', also called the '''Real IRA''', an [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] [[paramilitary]] group. The group was formed in late 1997 by members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] who disagreed with that organisation's ceasefire.

The Real IRA is the largest and most active of the [[dissident republican]] paramilitaries [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign|waging a campaign against]] the British security forces. The other main republican paramilitary groups are the [[Óglaigh na hÉireann (Real IRA splinter group)|group which calls itself Óglaigh na hÉireann]],  the [[Continuity IRA]] and [[Arm na Poblachta]] the newest group. All actions listed took place in [[Northern Ireland]] unless stated otherwise.

Tomorrow is usually considered just beyond the [[present]] and counter to [[yesterday (time)|yesterday]].

For a young child, "tomorrow" is "an undefined, infinite time of the idea that time is just an infinite and arbitrary definition of an yet unidentified of what we like to call time, yet the child slowly learns the meaning of tomorrow." The concept of "tomorrow" is rarely understood by 3-year-old children, but 4 year olds understand the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Folberg|first1=Jay|last2=Milne|first2=Ann|last3=Salem|first3=Peter|title=Divorce and Family Mediation: Models, Techniques, and Applications|year=2004|publisher=[[Guilford Press]]|isbn=9781593850029|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of the town of [[Oberwart]] (Hun: ''Felsőőr'') and the two villages of [[Unterwart]] (Hun: ''Alsóőr'') and [[Siget in der Wart]] (Hun: ''Őrisziget''). The population of the three settlements was 7694 according to the 2001 census, of whom 1922 people (25%) belonged to the ethnic [[Magyars|Hungarian]] minority. The economic and cultural center of the microregion is Oberwart/Felsőőr.

==History==
In the 11th century the region was part of the border zone (''gyepű'') of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The mainly uninhabited frontier was defended by free border guard communities called ''őrök'' és ''lövők'' (guards and archers). In contemporary [[Latin]] documents they are called ''spiculatores'' and ''sagittarii''. They were probably related to the border guards of the eastern frontier, the [[Székelys]].

The descendants of the guards are still living in the villages of the Upper Őrség (and in the Lower Őrség or simply [[Őrség]] in present-day [[Hungary]]). The archers later assimilated into the [[German people|German]] population. They lived around the villages of Alsólövő (now [[Unterschützen]]) and Felsölövő (now [[Oberschützen]]). There were also other border guard communities elsewhere.

In the early Middle Ages the ''gyepű'' became part of the [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|county]] of [[Vas (former county)|Vas]]. Upper Őrség belonged to this county until 1921.

The community of the ''őr''s were granted the privileges of nobility by King [[Charles I of Hungary]] at the beginning of the 14th century. They were free of serfdom and taxation. These privileges were acknowledged by [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph I]] in 1582. 

Their nobility differentiated the ''őr''s from the people of the neighbouring villages, and was important in the formation of their distinct identity. Some families kept track of their noble origins even in the 20th century. In the village of Alsóőr/Unterwart several families trace back their origin to medieval times, for example the Balikó, Balla, Benedek, Benkő, Deáki, Farkas, Gaál, Gangoly, Gyáki, Györög, Heritz, Kelemen, Leéb, Moór, Német, Paál, Palank, Seper, Szabó, Takács and Zarka families.

Upper Őrség became a language island in the 16th century. At that time the neighbouring territories were already populated with Germans. After the devastating [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] war in 1532 [[Croatian people|Croatian]] settlers arrived. The ''őr''s became an isolated community in this new situation. They spoke their distinct dialect and practised strict endogamy until at least the middle of the 20th century.

The ''őr''s took part in the Hungarian wars of independence against the [[Habsburgs]] in the [[Rákóczi Uprising]] (1703-1711) and in the Revolutionary war of 1848-49.

===20th century: decline===

At the end of the 19th century the community began to dwindle, due to the decline of small crafts and the frittering away of the noble properties between the children{{clarifyme|date=January 2013}}. Several new Hungarian civil servants and intellectuals arrived in Felsőőr which was the centre of local government but the newcomers remained "strangers" to the original population. After the absorption into Austria in 1921 most of them left [[Burgenland]].

After [[World War I]] a small German-speaking area in the west of Hungary was awarded to the Republic of [[Austria]] by the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. The people of Upper Őrség protested against the decision but their attempt to establish an independent micro-state (see [[Lajtabánság]]) failed.

As an ethnic minority the ''őr''s tried to maintain their identity in the first decades of the new republic. After the [[Anschluss]] the policy of [[Germanization]] severely affected the ethnic minorities. Hungarian schools were closed and the use of native language strongly discouraged. During [[World War II]] the Hungarian population of Burgenland halved (in 1934 10,442 Hungarians lived in the province, in 1951 only 5251).

After World War II the remaining ''őr''s were totally separated from the mother country by the [[Iron Curtain]]. In the 1960s Oberwart became a small industrial town with a German majority. Assimilation accelerated, although there were attempts to keep alive the sense of identity, for example by the formation of cultural groups and associations. The Reformed Church played an important part of this process, especially in Oberwart/Felsőőr. In 1976 the Hungarians were officially recognised as a minority group by the Austrian state. The Austrian policy against ethnic minorities changed very slowly in the last decades of the 20th century, but today minority rights are accepted.

After the democratic change in Hungary in 1989 and the accession to the [[European Union|EU]] in 2004 the remaining Hungarian population of the region had an opportunity to re-establish cultural and economic connections with Hungary.

==Language==
The Hungarians of Upper Őrség have a distinct dialect, probably related to the Székelys of [[Transylvania]]. Typical phonetical differences compared to the standard [[Hungarian language]]:

* {{IPA|/ɟ/}} becomes {{IPA|/dʒ/}} for example the word ''gyerek'' (child) is pronounced as ''dzserek''
* {{IPA|/c/}} becomes {{IPA|/tʃ/}} for example the word ''bátyám'' (uncle) is pronounced as ''bácsám''
* {{IPA|/v/}} becomes {{IPA|/b/}} for example the word ''szarvas'' (deer) is pronounced as ''szarbas''
* {{IPA|/n/}} becomes {{IPA|/ɲ/}} for example the word ''szappan'' (soap) is pronounced as ''szoppany''

'''Karl Artur Vilhelm Moberg''' (20 August 1898 &amp;ndash; 8 August 1973) was a Swedish [[journalist]], author, [[playwright]], [[historian]], and debater. His literary career, spanning more than 45 years, is associated with his series [[The Emigrants (novels)|''The Emigrants'']]. The four books, published between 1949 and 1959, deal with the [[Swedish emigration to the United States]] in the 19th century, and are the subject of two movie adaptations and a musical. Among other works are ''[[Raskens]]'' (1927) and ''[[Ride This Night (novel)|Ride This Night]]'' (1941), a historical novel of a 17th-century rebellion in [[Småland]] acknowledged for its subliminal but widely recognised criticism against the [[Nazi Germany|Hitler regime]].

A noted public intellectual and debater in Sweden, he was noted for very vocal criticism of the [[Swedish monarchy]] (most notably after the [[Haijby affair]]), likening it with a servile government by [[divine mandate]], and publicly supporting its replacement with a Swiss-style [[confederal]] [[republic]]. He spoke out aggressively against the policies of [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Greek military junta]], and the [[Soviet Union]], and his works were among those destroyed in [[Nazi book burnings]]. In 1971, he scolded Prime Minister [[Olof Palme]] for refusing to offer the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] to its recipient [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] – who was refused permission to attend the ceremony in Stockholm – through the Swedish embassy in [[Moscow]].

Moberg's suicide by self-inflicted drowning also drew much attention. He had had a long struggle with [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[writer's block]].

==Early life==

Karl Artur Vilhelm Moberg was born in 1898 on a farm outside of the town [[Emmaboda]] in the Parish of [[Algutsboda, Sweden|Algutsboda]] in [[Småland]], in southern Sweden. He was the fourth child of six, of whom only three survived into adulthood. His forebears were soldiers and small farmers. He lived the first nine years of his life at the tenement soldier's cottage in Moshultamåla that his father Karl Moberg, a territorial soldier, took over in 1888. In 1907 the family moved to a small farm in the village of Moshultamåla. This had been the family home of his mother Ida Moberg; they had lost it due to poverty. Money from her family in America enabled them to buy the property back.  Moberg had only limited schooling from 1906 until 1912.  However, as a child he was an avid reader; he published his first writing at the age of 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vilhelmmoberg.com/english.html |title=Vilhelm Moberg - The Greatest Swedish Author |author=A.A |work=vilhelmmoberg.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207064136/http://www.vilhelmmoberg.com/english.html |archivedate=December 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moberg worked as a farmer and forest laborer, and later at [[glassblowing]] before and between his various studies.  In 1916 he nearly emigrated to the United States, following his uncle and aunt, but ultimately decided to remain in Sweden with his parents. Largely self-educated, Moberg studied at [[Kronoberg]] County Folk High School in [[Grimslöv]] from 1916 to 1917, and at Katrineholms Praktiska Skola, a private school in [[Katrineholm]], from 1917 to 1918.  Moberg contracted the [[Spanish Flu]] in 1918, and was sick for half a year. After his illness, Moberg took a position on the newspaper ''Vadstena Läns Tidning'' in [[Östergötland]] which published many of his stories between 1919 and 1929.

In 1926, Moberg made his breakthrough as a playwright when his comedy ''Kassabrist'' had a successful run in Stockholm. He published his first novel ''Raskens'' the following year. Moberg became a full-time writer when the success of ''Raskens'' enabled him to devote himself entirely to writing.

==Author==

[[File:LA2-vx06-vilhelmmoberg.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Bust near the [[Swedish Emigrant Institute]], [[Växjö]]]]
Many of his works have been translated into English, and he is well-recognized in the English-speaking world among those interested in [[Scandinavia]]n culture and history. In his autobiographical novel, ''A Soldier with a Broken Rifle'' (Swedish: ''Soldat med brutet gevär''), he speaks to the importance of giving voice to the downtrodden, illiterate classes of his forebears. This viewpoint also formed his ''History of the Swedish People, I-II'' (Swedish: ''Min svenska historia, berättad för folket'', I-II), published in 1970-71 in both Swedish and English. He had intended the history to have more volumes, but he never finished it.

As a playwright, Moberg wrote 38 works for the stage or for radio (1919-1973). Some were produced as lighter classics of the Swedish stage and television, or were adapted as feature films by directors such as [[Ingmar Bergman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingmarbergman.se/page.asp?guid%3D672037B6-F0AA-48D9-A9EC-7D53DEAD8786 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106073039/http://www.ingmarbergman.se/page.asp?guid=672037B6-F0AA-48D9-A9EC-7D53DEAD8786 |archivedate=November 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Lea och Rakel''/''Leah and Rachel''; [[Malmö City Theatre]] 1955) and [[Alf Sjöberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053781/|title=Domaren (1960)|date=14 October 1960|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Domaren''/''The Judge''; 1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0595002/|title=Vilhelm Moberg|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social themes==

Moberg had become a member of a young [[Social Democrats]] club in 1913. In his works, he often expressed a republican (anti-royalist) point of view, much due to the facts that surfaced in the [[Kejne affair]] and [[Haijby affair]], in which Moberg took an active part.

From the 1950s, Moberg participated in debates about the [[Swedish monarchy]], bureaucracy, and corruption, and devoted much time to help individual citizens who had suffered injustice. Much like others of his generation of Swedish authors from a working-class background, such as [[Ivar Lo-Johansson]], [[Harry Martinson]] and [[Moa Martinson]], Moberg depicted the life of the dispossessed, their traditions, customs, and everyday struggle. His novels are important documents of social history, and trace the influences of various social and political movements in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/vmoberg.htm |title=Vilhelm Moberg |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706154417/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/vmoberg.htm |archivedate=6 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Emigrants'' series==

[[File:Grav Vilhelms Mobergs.jpg|right|thumb|80px|Grave at Norra
 in Stockholm]]
Moberg's most famous work is [[The Emigrants (novels)|''The Emigrants'' series of four novels]], written between 1949 and 1959, that describe one Swedish family's emigration from [[Småland]] to [[Chisago County, Minnesota]] in the mid-19th century. This was a destiny shared by almost one million Swedish people, including several of the author's relatives.  These novels have been translated into English: ''[[The Emigrants (Swedish novel)|The Emigrants]]'' (1951), ''[[Unto a Good Land]]'' (1954), ''[[The Settlers (novel)|The Settlers]]'' (1961), and ''[[The Last Letter Home]]'' (1961). His literary portrayal of the [[Swedish-American]] immigrant experience is considered comparable to [[O.E. Rolvaag]]'s work depicting that  of [[Norwegian-American]] immigrants.

===Films and musical===

Swedish [[film director]] [[Jan Troell]] 1971-72 turned the books into two major feature films, ''[[The Emigrants (film)|The Emigrants]]'' and ''[[The New Land]]'', starring [[Max von Sydow]] and [[Liv Ullmann]] as Karl Oskar and Kristina. These were nominated for several [[Academy Award]]s and ''The New Land'' won [[Golden Globe Award]]s.

The [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]'' (English title ''Kristina'') (1995) by ex-[[ABBA]] members [[Björn Ulvaeus]] and [[Benny Andersson]] is based on Moberg's ''The Emigrants Series''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jimcolyer.com/papers/entry?id=56|title=Jim Colyer|work=jimcolyer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even several of the other works by Moberg have been turned into films and TV series in Sweden over the years.

==Moberg Room==

Moberg donated his papers to the [[Swedish Emigrant Institute]] in [[Växjö, Sweden]], It displays his original manuscripts, excerpts, notes, and photographs in The Moberg Room, in such a way that visitors get a feeling of meeting Vilhelm Moberg in his workshop.  This unique collection of Moberg memorabilia includes Axel Olsson's sculpture entitled ''The Emigrants'', which portrays the main characters featured in ''The Emigrants Series''. The Vilhelm Moberg Society, headquartered in the Swedish Emigrant Institute, promotes publications, research and popular interest in Moberg's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utvandrarnashus.se/eng/|title=Swedish Emigrant Institute|work=utvandrarnashus.se|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006130904/http://www.utvandrarnashus.se/eng/|archivedate=2013-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

Moberg struggled with severe depression in the last years of his life. He committed [[suicide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hochman|first=Stanley|title=McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zo5os6d0rvMC&amp;pg=PA397&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=juQh2KrPNh&amp;sig=XHlRaiyS1Wg26hVHxL2EzlH8kmk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3z0jSsaWFZnKtgf5173EBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10|accessdate=1 June 2009|edition=2|year=1984|publisher= McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-079169-5|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; by drowning himself in a lake outside his house. He left a note to his wife saying: "The time is twenty past seven; I can be found in the lake, for eternal sleep. Forgive me, I could not endure." Moberg was buried in [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in [[Stockholm]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Klockan är tjugo över sju. Jag går att söka i sjön, sömnen utan slut. Förlåt mig, jag orkade inte uthärda.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
