Mohan co-founded the Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mohan |first=A. G. |authorlink=A. G. Mohan |year=2010 |title=[[Krishnamacharya: His Life and Teachings]] |location=Boston |publisher=Shambhala |isbn=978-1-59030-800-4 | page = 50 | ref=AGMohan}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Chennai, India, and was its Honorary Secretary from its inception, in 1976, to 1989.  Mohan was also the convener of Sri Krishnamacharya’s centenary celebrations.

Indra Mohan, wife of A. G. Mohan and co-founder of Svastha Yoga &amp; Ayurveda, is one of the few people who received a post-graduate diploma in yoga from Krishnamacharya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mohan |first=A.

==Recognition by Krishnamacharya==
In the foreword to ''Yoga for Body, Breath, and Mind'', Krishnamacharya states:

{{Quote|Now my sons, Venkata Desikachar and Mohanasarma, who are jointly studying under me, have attained this status of ''sathirthyas''.  ''Sathirthya'' means "studied under one ''Guru''," says Amarasimha.  This gives me the satisfaction that I have not taught the shastras (the sacred treatise) to an undeserving person.  Let one, two, or many students learn from one teacher about a particular subject, or varied subjects or shastras.

But what is special here is that Mohan has studied the ''Patanjali Yoga Sutras'' and its practical application entirely from me.  He is competent to teach ''asana'' and ''pranayama'' suitable to each individual.  He is also competent to teach the asana and pranayama portions of other shastras which he has studied thoroughly.  He has studied the ''Samkhya'' philosophy in depth.  In Ayurveda he has studied the important portions of ''Nidana sthanam'' (diagnosis), ''Cikitsa sthanam'' (treatment), ''Vimana sthanam'' (causes of disease), and ''Garbha sthanam'' (constitution of body).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Krishnamacharya | first = Tirumalai | chapter= Foreword | year=2002 | editor-first=A. G. | editor-last=Mohan | title = Yoga for Body, Breath, and Mind:  A Guide to Personal Reintegration | location=Boston |publisher=Shambhala Publications |isbn=978-1-57062-977-8 | pages = xv-xvi }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Svastha Yoga &amp; Ayurveda ==
The Mohans offer their teachings in India and internationally under the banner of Svastha Yoga &amp; Ayurveda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Svastha Yoga &amp; Ayurveda | url = http://svastha.net | accessdate = November 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''svastha'' in Sanskrit literally means "to stay in one’s own abode" and refers to the state of complete health and balance.   Svastha Yoga &amp; Ayurveda advocates an integrated approach using yoga and ayurveda to achieve the state of ''svastha''.

'''AONTAS - The Irish National Adult Learning Organisation''' is an Irish non-governmental organisation for the promotion and facilitation of adult learning. It was founded in 1969 by Fr. [[Liam Carey]] of the [[Dublin Institute of Adult Education]], and launched by [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]] TD. Sean O'Murchu was elected its first president. While it has been a non-governmental body since 1976, it receives funding from the Department of Education and Skills.

The word ''aontas'' ({{IPA-ga|ˈeːn̪ˠt̪ˠəsˠ}}) is [[Irish language|Irish]] for "union", but is also a [[backronym]] for ''Aos Oideachais Náisiúnta Trí Aontú Saorálach'', meaning "national adult education through voluntary unification".

Membership of AONTAS includes individuals as well as a number of state bodies such as Education and Training Boards ETBs, community education organisations,  trade unions, [[Institute of Technology#Ireland|Institutes of Technology]], providers of learning, and community projects amongst others.

AONTAS produces a number of publications and periodicals such as ''The Adult Learners Journal'' as well as research publications. It is a registered charity.

'''Archimedes-lab.org''' is a free and collaborative [[edutainment]] project developed and maintained by [[Gianni A. Sarcone]] and Marie-Jo Waeber, two authors and writers with more than thirty years of experience in the fields of [[visual thinking]] and [[education]]. This educational project is part of the ''Open Education Consortium''&lt;ref name="Consortium"&gt;[http://www.oeconsortium.org/courses/view/aef9a8217994fd8daed5d06f2e7308d2/ ''Open Education Consortium''].&lt;/ref&gt; and it is supervised by a consulting network of experts specializing in online education.

The main goal of the web site is to teach mathematics differently and to make it accessible to everyone through visual puzzles and games. The site walks visitors through various problem solving strategies and discoveries in the world of recreational mathematics.

Limited parts of the site are offered in French, Italian, Spanish and German. But regular puzzle features like the ''Puzzle of the Week'', the ''Sunday Puzzle'' and the ''Puzzle of the Month'' are available in three languages:&lt;ref name="Language"&gt;[http://www.archimedes-lab.org/archive_puzzles.html ''Puzzle Archive''].&lt;/ref&gt; English, French and Italian.

== Site contents ==
Archimedes-lab.org is divided into four main categories: puzzles &amp; tests, illusions &amp; paradoxes, mind &amp; brain, oddities &amp; curiosities. Among the proposed educational tools and tutorials, visitors will find intuitive visuals, number games, puzzles with downloadable pieces, perception puzzles and interactive [[optical illusions]]. A principal objective throughout the site is the enhancement of [[critical thinking]] skills and the development of [[creativity]]. Here's a quote from [[Scientific American]] (May 27, 2003): "This virtual lab borrows the empirical spirit and creative curiosity that [[Archimedes]] brought to his work and invites visitors to explore with the same expectations for mind-blowing discovery."

== Awards and accolades ==
Archimedes-lab.org has won several awards from scientific and educational publications,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archimedes-lab.org/pressrelease.html ''Archimedes Lab's Accolades'']&lt;/ref&gt; including a Scientific American Web Award in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00077DD8-59F2-1ECA-8E1C809EC588EF21 ''SCIAM web award'']&lt;/ref&gt; the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Web Award,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040624193754/http://www.nctm.org/news/webbytes/2004_05webbytes.htm ''NCTM Web Award'']&lt;/ref&gt; and a mention in [[MERLOT]], the Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching&lt;ref name="Merlot"&gt;[http://www.merlot.org/artifact/ArtifactDetail.po?oid=1010000000000223431 ''Merlot – Archimedes’ Laboratory'']&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[The DO-IT Center]], the Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology Center.&lt;ref name="Do It"&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/doit/archimedes-laboratory-project-0 ''DO IT – Archimedes’ Laboratory'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, ATL members endorsed a proposed merger with the [[National Union of Teachers]] to form a new union known as the [[National Education Union|national education union]], which came into existence on 1 September 2017. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/mar/22/nut-atl-merge-national-education-union&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time, approximately 120,000 individuals belonged to the union (apart from those professions included in the name, [[Teaching assistant|education support staff]] and [[Teaching assistant (United Kingdom)|teaching assistants]] were also members), making it the third largest teaching and education union in the UK. ATL had members throughout England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and British Service schools overseas.

The ATL brand continues as a section or subsidiary of the National Education Union.

==Governance and administration==
ATL was led by its [[Executive committee|Executive Committee]] who were assisted by a General Secretary. All senior officers and officials were elected by an Association wide ballot and the overall direction was determined by the Annual Conference which had delegates from each branch.

The ATL President served a one-year term.
From September 2009, Lesley Ward.
From September 2010, Andy Brown.
From September 2011, Alison Robinson.
From September 2012, Hank Roberts.
From September 2013, Alison Sherratt.
From September 2014, Mark Baker.
From September 2015, Kim Knappett.
From September 2016, Shelagh Hirst.
The final ATL General Secretary was Dr [[Mary Bousted]].

==History==
[[File:The march.jpg|thumb|right|Striking teachers and public sector workers march down the Kingsway, London, flanked by police on 17 June, as part of the  [[2011 United Kingdom anti-austerity protests]].]]
The origins of ATL go back to 1884 when 180 women met to create the Association of Assistant Mistresses (AAM). These women worked in schools founded for [[higher education of girls]]. Their concern was primarily for the pupils.  However, in 1921, the AAM appointed representatives to the newly formed [[Burnham Committee on Salaries in Secondary Schools]].

1891 saw the formation of the Association of Assistant Masters in Secondary Schools (AMA). Its purpose was to protect and improve the conditions of service of secondary teachers. Between 1899 and 1908 it played an influential part in obtaining security of tenure for assistant teachers through the [[Endowed Schools Act]].

Then in 1978 AAM and AMA merged to form the '''Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association''' (AMMA) with a membership of approximately 75,000.  The name was changed in 1993 to the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL).

ATL affiliated to the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] in 1999.  It resigned from the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]] in 2015.

In January 2011, the [[Association for College Management]] merged into ATL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acm.uk.com/AboutAMiE/tabid/192/Default.aspx About AMiE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304014929/http://www.acm.uk.com/AboutAMiE/tabid/192/Default.aspx |date=March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Badman Review''', also known as the Review into [[Home_education_in_the_United_Kingdom|Elective Home Education]] in [[England]], was conducted by  [[Graham Badman]] the former Director of Children's Services at [[Kent County Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/jun/11/home-education-parents-register Parents who home educate children to be forced to register] [[The Guardian]], 11 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  

The review was commissioned on 19 January 2009 by [[Ed Balls]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090611/wmstext/90611m0001.htm Elective Home Education] [[Hansard]] 11 Jun 2009 : Column 44WS&lt;/ref&gt; the Secretary of State for [[DCSF|Children, Schools and Families]] with a remit to investigate current practice of local authorities in relation to home educators, and also to investigate whether home education could be used as a cover for some forms of child abuse, such as forced marriage and domestic servitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/pns/DisplayPN.cgi?pn_id=2009_0013 Action To Ensure Children’s Education &amp; Welfare] DCSF Press Release, Jan 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Published on 11 June 2009  the review's recommendations that related to safeguarding were accepted in full by Ed Balls on the day of publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/_download/?id=6081  Review of elective home education in England] Letter from Balls to Badman, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The review found no evidence to support suggestions that home education was linked to forced marriage, servitude or child trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/5506542/Home-education-clampdown-an-infringement-of-civil-liberties.html Home education clampdown 'an infringement of civil liberties'] [[The Daily Telegraph]] 12 Jun 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  A public consultation on the recommendations of the review ended in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/consultations/index.cfm?action=consultationDetails&amp;consultationId=1643&amp;external=no&amp;menu=1 Home Education - registration and monitoring proposals] eConsultation, Launch date 11 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses to the review ==
The review caused widespread anger&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7838783.stm Home educators angry at review] [[BBC News]] review&lt;/ref&gt; amongst home educators who rejected Badman's review as rushed, badly researched, disproportionate and offering little in the way of evidence to justify his recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8404635.stm Home educators in record petition of MPs] [[BBC News]] 9 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative MP [[Mark Field]]  has spoken against any changes to the current laws covering [[education in England]]. He presented a debate&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.parliament.uk/2009/06/mps-debate-home-education/ MPs debate home education] Mark Field, Conservative MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, introduced a debate in Westminster Hall on home education, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; on 9 June 2009 in which he argued for the status quo to remain.

On 22 July 2009, [[Children, Schools and Families Select Committee|The Children, Schools and Families Committee]] (the Parliamentary Select Committee with oversight of the work of the Department for Children, Schools and Families) announced its own inquiry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/csf/csfpn220709.cfm Children, Schools and Families Committee Press Notice]&lt;/ref&gt; into the handling of the Badman Review. Its report was published on 16 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmchilsch.htm Children, Schools and Families Committee Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Select Committee's Summary&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmchilsch/39/3903.htm Children, Schools and Families Committee Summary]&lt;/ref&gt; and Conclusions'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmchilsch/39/3912.htm Children, Schools and Families Committee Conclusions]&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Select Committee endorsed the idea of a registration scheme for home educating families, though suggested it should be voluntary in the first instance. However, the committee was critical of some of the recommendations in the Badman report, and of DCSF's handling of the review:

:* ''Where we believe that the Badman Report and the proposals in the Children, Schools and Families Bill run into difficulty is in their conflation of education and safeguarding matters''
:* ''The way in which the Department has handled the Badman review has been unfortunate—from the way in which it framed the review, through to its drafting of legislation prior to publication of the related consultation findings. We trust that the Department will learn from this episode as it takes forward other such reviews in future''

: The Select Committee's recommendations include:
:* Any registration system for home educating families should be light touch. In view of the concerns expressed by home educators about compulsory registration, we suggest that registration should be voluntary.
:* We do not believe that annual home visits by local authority officers to home educating families would represent an improvement on existing safeguarding legislation
:* We are not convinced that these meetings need take place in the family home under any circumstances.
:* We do not believe that local authority officers responsible for liaising with home educating families should be given the right to interview a child away from the child's parents.
:* We are concerned that any monitoring of home education provision should not undermine the flexibility and freedom currently enjoyed by home educating families in relation to the child's learning and development.

On the evening of 8 December 2009, history was made in the House of Commons when the highest number of petitions ever presented simultaneously on a single topic was placed in the petitions bag behind the Speaker's chair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/8848133 Petition record over home schooling] [[The Guardian]] 9 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative MP [[Graham Stuart (UK politician)|Graham Stuart]] presented the petition rejecting the recommendations of the Badman Review from home educators across England and Wales declaring:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a historic night. More than 70 Honourable and Right Honourable members will present petitions from more than 120 different constituencies opposing the compulsory registration and monitoring of home educated children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legislation==
Following their acceptance of the Badman Review the government proposed, in the [[Queen's Speech]] on 18 November 2009, the introduction of a [[Ed_Balls#Children.2C_Schools_and_Families_Bill|Children, Schools and Families Bill]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8365163.stm  Queen's Speech: Bill-by-bill] [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; which would amend the [[Education Act 1996]] so as to require home educated children to be registered with the [[local authority]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmbills/008/10008.38-44.html#m01s  Children, Schools and Families Bill] Schedule 1 - Home education, England (draft legislation)&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed changes were dropped due to a lack of cross party support prior to the pending election in May 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8607677.stm Ed Balls drops key education reforms] [[BBC News]] 7 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Statistics ==

In 1960, 50 percent of [[legally blind]] school-age children in the United States were able to read [[Braille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2007 ''Annual Report'' from the [[American Printing House for the Blind]], there are approximately 57,696 legally blind children in the U.S.  Out of those school-age children, only 10 percent use Braille as their primary reading medium.&lt;ref name=Blind2008&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major turning point for Braille literacy was the passage by the [[United States Congress]] of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]], which moved thousands of children from specialized schools for the blind into mainstream public schools.&lt;ref name="Ranalli2008"/&gt; Because only a small percentage of public schools could afford to train and hire Braille-qualified teachers, Braille literacy has declined since the law took effect.&lt;ref name="Ranalli2008"/&gt; Braille literacy rates have improved slightly since the bill was passed, in part because of pressure from consumers and advocacy groups that have led 27 states to pass legislation mandating that children who are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn braille.&lt;ref name="Ruby Riles" /&gt;

In 1998-99 there were approximately 55,200 legally blind children in the United States, but only 5,500 of them used braille as their primary reading medium.&lt;ref name=Blind1999&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Braille education is crucial to literacy for a visually impaired child. A study conducted in the state of Washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well as, if not better than, their sighted peers in several areas, including vocabulary and comprehension.  In the preliminary adult study, while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment, it was found that 44 percent of the participants who had learned to read in Braille were unemployed, compared to the 77 percent unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print.&lt;ref name=Ph2004&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2018}}, 90 percent of those who are braille literate are employed. Among adults who do not know Braille, only 1 in 3 is employed.&lt;ref name="Ranalli2008"/&gt; Statistically, history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows visually impaired children not only to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment, but also later in life as they enter the workforce.&lt;ref name="Ruby Riles" /&gt;

== Programs ==

===Braille Instruction at Hadley===

Hadley is the largest educator of braille as well as the largest worldwide provider of distance education for people who are blind or visually impaired. Braille literacy has been a priority for Hadley since its founding in 1920, and to this day, braille courses are still the most popular. During the 2010 fiscal year, Hadley enrolled nearly 3,400 students in braille reading and writing courses alone (combined sighted and blind students). Hadley currently offers 14 braille courses taught by 11 highly trained instructors. Nine courses are focused on tactile learners, and Hadley also provides five courses for sighted individuals, including families and professionals in the field.

Hadley School has advanced the use of braille in a number of ways over the years, including being one of the first institutions to use the Thermoform Duplicator, which copies braille from paper to a Brailon (a sheet of durable plastic) and one of the first to use a computer-driven, high-speed braille printer. A longtime leader in braille production, Hadley produces more than 50,000 braille pages each year, supplementing mass brailling done offsite. For a modest fee, Hadley provides braille transcription services in accordance with the [[Braille Authority of North America]]. Transcribers are certified by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped.

=== NLS Braille Certification Program ===

The [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]] (NLS) of the [[Library of Congress]] has contracted with the [[National Federation of the Blind]] (NFB) to offer a certificate of proficiency for braille transcribers and proofreaders who are interested in working in their communities to produce Braille materials for blind people. Certified Braille volunteers transcribe material into Braille that is used by state departments of special education, NLS, and libraries that distribute books and magazines through the NLS program. These volunteers complete a detailed course of Braille transcribing and provide essential materials in the advancement of Braille literacy.&lt;ref name=Service2006&gt;{{Citation
 | title = About Braille | url = https://www.loc.gov/nls/reference/factsheets/braille.html
 | year = 2006 | author = Service, National Library
 | journal = NLS Factsheets
 | issue = May | accessdate = 2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NLS also offers a broad range of Braille literacy information and resources including braille books, software, and other material intended to assist with the production of braille. This information can be very helpful for family members, friends, and professionals who desire information about braille literacy. They provide educational resources for instructors who teach braille as well as those who are interested in learning to read and write Braille.

=== ReadBooks! Because Braille Matters ===

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20090510083746/http://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/readbooks/index.html ReadBooks!] program from [http://www.nbp.org National Braille Press] distributes free braille literacy bags in the U.S. and Canada to families with blind children, birth to age 7. The program introduces blind children to braille at the earliest age and encourages families to read print/braille books together. Since the inception of the program in 2001, over 9,000 braille literacy bags have been distributed in English or Spanish.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20090510083746/http://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/readbooks/index.html ReadBooks!] bags contain age-appropriate print-braille books; a primer for sighted parents to learn braille; tactile literacy objects/games; waxed string for drawing; and a guide for parents on why and how to read books with their young blind child. Print-braille books are standard print books, like ''Miss Nelson Is Missing'' or ''Corduroy'', with braille text added on transparent plastic sheets so everyone can read together. National Braille Press works with educators and early intervention professionals to identify families who could benefit from the book bags; [https://web.archive.org/web/20091001191130/http://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/readbooks/request.html families can request their own bags]. There is increasing evidence that parental beliefs and attitudes about reading and the opportunities parents provide their children in reading can greatly influence children's reading development. Parents can help their children prepare by providing a braille-rich environment in the home.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justreadflorida.com/promote.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501005007/http://www.justreadflorida.com/promote.asp |archivedate=2009-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dots for Tots ===

The Dots for Tots program aims to engage and strengthen the senses of a visually impaired child.  This is important to get them prepared for reading and interested in literacy.&lt;ref name=Lamb1998&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The free program offers free books and kits to promote literacy among blind children of preschool and early elementary age. The dots in this program are very important and parallel with the literacy requirements of a sighted child learning their ABCs. It also helps grab a blind child's interest in the same way that a picture book encourages literacy for a sighted child.&lt;ref name=Witsenhausen2004&gt;{{Citation

The program equips schools and educators with the tools to ensure that children who are blind receive the same quality of education that their sighted peers do. It helps remove education barriers as well as ease the fears that many children have of facing school with a handicap.&lt;ref name=Whittaker1999&gt;{{Citation

This program provides visually impaired children with books that have been printed in Braille. Children are able to follow along with the rest of their classmates when reading popular children's books in libraries, at home, or in a school environment. Dots for Tots provide an entire book kit that includes the children's book in braille, a tape with a professional descriptive narration with sound effects, and a set of three-dimensional toys that allow them to understand the importance of visualizing stories with their fingers.&lt;ref name=America&gt;{{Citation

=== Connecting the Dots ===

The [[American Foundation for the Blind]] (AFB) offers the Connecting the Dots resource for parents to promote early Braille literacy. The program provides a folder containing fact sheets about braille, resource lists, and information for parents about braille, organizations that promote braille literacy, sources of braille books and magazines, adapted materials, and other information intended to promote literacy development.&lt;ref name=Blind&gt;{{Citation

=== Instant Access to Braille ===

The Instant Access to Braille program, supported through [[US Department of Education]] Office of [[Special Education]] Programs CFDA 84.00327A, provides blind and visually impaired students with access to learning materials in  braille to support braille literacy efforts in general education classrooms.  This program provides portable braille note-taking devices to students to train students as well as assist educators, parents, and school administrators overcome the barriers of teaching special needs children and ensuring that students receive the equivalent education opportunities that sighted children receive. The program also provides assistance with converting their printed learning materials into electronic format so that visually impaired students are not at disadvantaged in the school environment.

The Instant Access program is intended to assist students in grades 3-10 that use [[New York (state)|New York]] State curriculum and is focused on academics related mainly to [[Social Studies]]. There is no charge for the Braille note-taking devices, disk drives, printers or setup of the equipment. The program is a one-year school-based project and can be adjusted to take full advantage of features that will benefit the student and support the education process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''Browne Review''' or '''Independent Review of Higher Education Funding and Student Finance'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hereview.independent.gov.uk/hereview/members-biographies/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112121748/http://hereview.independent.gov.uk/hereview/members-biographies/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 November 2009 |title=Independent Review of Higher Education Funding and Student Finance » Members’ biographies |publisher=Hereview.independent.gov.uk |accessdate=16 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a review to consider the future direction of [[higher education]] funding in England.

It was launched on 9 November 2009 and published its findings on 12 October 2010. It was chaired by [[John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley|Lord Browne of Madingley]], the former chief executive of [[BP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Polly Curtis, education editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/nov/09/tuition-fees-rise-review-universities |title=Former BP head to run tuition fees review &amp;#124; Education &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 November 2009|accessdate=16 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It recommended wide-ranging changes to the system of university funding, including removing the cap on the level of fees that universities can charge, and increasing the income level at which graduates must begin to pay back their loans to £21,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://youshottheinvisibleswordsman.co.uk/2011/03/03/browne-review-research-spending/Browne Review research spending]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
According to Lord Mandelson the review would consider "balance of contributions to universities by taxpayers, students, graduates and employers" to University finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(UKPA) – 22 hours ago |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gNLslDep3lfQkioBwHw4bfKs3PNg |title=The Press Association: Browne heads student funding review |publisher=Google |accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review would consider how much students should be charged for attending University.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8350051.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Education &amp;#124; Review of student fees launched |publisher=BBC News |date= 9 November 2009|accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel was told to take into account the goal of widening participation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The panel would report its findings after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gill |first=John |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=409011&amp;c=2 |title=Lord Browne to lead fees review |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review had been promised in 2004 to try to win over Labour rebels who nearly rejected the Bill which introduced £3,000 a year fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/nov/09/tuition-fees-rise-review-universities |title=Former BP head to run tuition fees review &amp;#124; Education &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 November 2009|accessdate=10 November 2009  | first=Polly | last=Curtis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review would consider other issues including simplifying the system of student finance and bursary arrangements.

The Browne Review made its first call for evidence in December 2009. Times Higher Education reported that the review's themes were "participation rates, the quality of the higher education system and affordability for students and the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morgan |first=John |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=409427 |title=Lord Browne begins |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=7 December 2009 |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background Research===

The Browne Review spent £68,000 on research, from a research budget of £120,000. The majority of the expenditure funded one unpublished opinion survey of students and parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=414764  Now that's research impact: 'paradigm-shifting' Browne drew on a single opinion survey]&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey focussed on how much participants would be willing to pay if fees were restructured. It asked 80 school pupils, 40 parents, 40 early-year University students, and 18 part-time students from various backgrounds for their opinion on University funding. Participants of the survey were posed questions on an upper-limit on fees of £6,000 per-annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/browne_review_opinion_survey|title=Review Survey|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interim findings==
In March 2010 the review published its initial findings stating that it had found "clear agreement" that the current level of fees had not deterred students but that the system of finance for part-time students was inadequate. The panel also found:

*clear evidence that bursaries are not understood by students early enough to have a substantial impact on their choices&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Attwood |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=410850 |title=Review finds "clear agreement" that top-up fees have not deterred students |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*consensus that potential students need better information, advice and guidance, including information on the teaching experience they can expect on different courses&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation1"/&gt;
*some concerns that a minority of students are deterred by [[top-up fees]]&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation1"/&gt;
*that there has been progress over the past five years in widening participation to higher education, but that this has been less marked at the most selective universities&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation1"/&gt;

==Political positions==

The Browne Review was set up by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] in 2009, but did not report until after the 2010 General Election. No party won the election outright, and after negotiations the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] parties formed a coalition government. The [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|Coalition Agreement]] gave the Liberal Democrats, who had campaigned against fee increases, the right to abstain from any vote to increase tuition fees. In this case, the effective majority of the Conservatives would fall to 24, meaning that the government could potentially be defeated by a rebellion of 12 of its own MPs.

===Labour===
[[Image:David_Miliband,_Davos_2010.jpg|right|thumb|170px|[[David Miliband]] was the only candidate in the Labour leadership election to reject a graduate tax]]
[[Lord Mandelson]], the former Business Secretary who set up the review into higher education funding, hinted in July 2009 at a tuition fee rise stating that excellence in higher education was "not cheap" and that the country "had to face up to the challenge of paying for excellence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jessica Shepherd |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/jul/27/mandelson-hints-tuition-fees-could-rise |title=Mandelson hints tuition fees could rise &amp;#124; Education &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=27 July 2009 |accessdate=21 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Labour Party manifesto for the 2010 General Election promised extra University places but made no commitment on how much students would have to pay. During the Labour Party leadership election in 2010 following the resignation of [[Gordon Brown]] both [[Ed Balls]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/9907/balls_favours_graduate_tax_rather_than_up_front_tuition_fees.html |title=Balls favours graduate tax rather than up front tuition fees &amp;#124; On Air Today |publisher=PoliticsHome |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081928/http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/9907/balls_favours_graduate_tax_rather_than_up_front_tuition_fees.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the eventual winner [[Ed Miliband]] came out in support of a [[graduate tax]] as a method of funding universities in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/25/tuition-fees-lib-dem-betrayal |title=Ed Miliband &amp;#124; Why I'd bin tuition fees &amp;#124; Comment is free |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Allegra Stratton, political correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jun/25/ed-miliband-suggests-graduate-tax |title=Ed Miliband suggests taxing graduates to fund universities &amp;#124; Politics |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 25 June 2010|accessdate=21 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Miliband]] was the only candidate in the leadership election not to support a graduate tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shackle |first=Samira |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/06/graduate-tax-david-miliband |title=David Miliband becomes Labour’s lone star against a graduate tax |work=New Statesman |location=UK |date=30 June 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/leading-article-a-graduate-tax-would-not-serve-universities-well-2014818.html |title=Leading Article: A graduate tax would not serve universities well – Higher, Education |work=The Independent |location=London |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservatives and Liberal Democrats===

The Conservatives have said that they will "consider carefully" the outcome of the review. In June 2010 David Willets stated that under the current arrangements students were a "burden on the taxpayer that had to be tackled" although he also stated he did not want to pre-empt the findings of Lord Browne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jessica Shepherd, education correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/jun/09/david-willetts-students-tuition-fees |title=David Willetts hints that university students will face higher fees &amp;#124; Education |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Democrats have traditionally supported free higher education but downgraded this pledge because it was seen to be an unaffordable spending commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joe Pike |url=http://www.journal-online.co.uk/article/6236-lib-dems-downgrade-tuition-fees-pledge |title=Lib Dems downgrade tuition fees pledge » The Journal |publisher=Journal-online.co.uk |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=11 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211105335/http://www.journal-online.co.uk/article/6236-lib-dems-downgrade-tuition-fees-pledge |archivedate=11 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Liberal Democrats had promised to abolish tuition fees over 6 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coughlan |first=Sean |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8645705.stm |title=Students threaten to swing seats over tuition fees |publisher=BBC News |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the elected Liberal Democrat MPs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nus.org.uk/Campaigns/Funding-Our-Future/Lib-Dem-MPs-sign-the-pledge/ |title=Lib Dem MPs sign the pledge: Funding Our Future: Campaigns |publisher=NUS.org.uk |accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of others, also signed the NUS [[Vote for Students pledge]], promising to vote against any proposed increase in fees.

===Coalition Government===

The Liberal Democrats agreed to abstain on a vote to increase fees as part of a Liberal-Conservative coalition government which emerged after the 2010 General Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411600 |title=Lib Dems free to abstain on fees vote |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow the Conservatives to pass an increase in tuition fees or even the removal of the cap on fees without the Liberal Democrats voting them down. The chief executive of Universities UK, [[Nicola Dandridge]], has stated that senior Liberal Democrats have told them that they consider their election manifesto pledge to be "complete nonsense" and that the "visceral" opposition to fees from the party base was not shared by senior figures.&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morgan |first=John |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=411668&amp;c=1 |title=Lib Dem division on fees abolition |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Liberal Democrat leader [[Ming Campbell]] has said that he is "likely" to honour the pledge he made to his constituents and rebel against his party by voting against a rise in fees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/politics/10174915.stm |title=Ex-Lib Dem leader Campbell would rebel on tuition fees |publisher=BBC News |date=28 May 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and newly elected Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader [[Simon Hughes]] has stated that the issue of fees could split the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article7147338.ece |accessdate=13 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; while reiterating the opposition of the Liberal Democrats to tuition fees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731164302/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hkQElN9Sl3z865D_u3o6AbPoKWng ]&lt;/ref&gt; The MP for the student-populated [[Leeds North West]], [[Greg Mulholland]], is considered to be the leader of a backbench rebellion against the review that is indicated to have the support of at least thirty Liberal Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11519148|title=University tuition fees 'to rise'|publisher=BBC News|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/leeds/2010/oct/13/leeds-students-protest-against-tuition-fees|title=Leeds students speak out in tuition fee controversy|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=13 October 2010|work=The Guardian |location=London  | first=John | last=Baron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 it was reported that a [[graduate tax]] was seriously being considered by [[Vince Cable]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1294538/Tuition-fees-swapped-graduate-tax.html?itoa=feeds-newsxml |title=Tuition fees could be swapped for graduate tax  |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date= 14 July 2010|accessdate=21 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although a senior Conservative anonymously briefed against Mr Cable stating it was "unlikely" that a graduate tax would be adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/jul/22/government-rejects-cable-graduate-tax |location=London |work=The Guardian  | title=Government 'rejects' Vince Cable's graduate tax plan | first=Jessica | last=Shepherd | date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130124180556/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5iYjZKYeiYvkq6az_Z4Kwz0OArvXA ]&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] has also backed a graduate tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/7957345/Nick-Clegg-backs-tax-on-university-graduates.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph  | title=Nick Clegg backs tax on university graduates | first1=Mary | last1=Riddell | first2=James | last2=Kirkup | date=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Submissions and lobbying==
The Russell Group's submission to the review stated that graduates should pay real rates of interest on their student loans to prevent a university funding crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richardson |first=Hannah |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10115822.stm |title=Universities say students may face earlier loan payback |publisher=BBC News |date= 14 May 2010|accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1994 Group]] have stated that there should be an increase in the cap to generate  competition between universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gill |first=John |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=411607&amp;c=2 |title=Cap doesn’t fit: let’s raise it incrementally |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy Piatt, head of the Russell Group, has stated that current levels of funding are not adequate if Universities are to remain globally competitive.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8350051.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Education &amp;#124; Review of student fees launched |publisher=BBC News |date=9 November 2009 |accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1994 Group have called for the review to ensure that cost does not prevent people from attending University and for a focus on the student experience.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

[[Million+]] have stated that students should not be asked to pay more for cuts in public funding and [[Unions 94]] have called for more progressive alternatives to variable tuition fees.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

The University and Colleges Union have stated that lifting the cap on tuition fees would be 'the most regressive piece of education policy since the war' and suggest replacing fees with a Business Education Tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucu.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=4622 |title=University and College Union – Fees increase will put university 'out of reach for majority', warns |publisher=UCU |date=17 May 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their second submission to the Browne Review the [[Russell Group]] stated that lifting the cap on tuition fees was the only “viable and fair” way of financing higher education and that the “liberalisation of the fee regime” was a future aim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Attwood |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411641 |title=Russell Group: if you want the best, the cap must go |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] concludes in its submission that: “Increasing fees without increasing loans and/or grants by the same value or more will result in a negative impact on participation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=410207 |title=Participation would fall if fees rise without extra aid |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Medical Association]] has warned that increasing tuition fees could land medical students with debts in excess of ₤90,000, as medical degrees are longer and give students less time to partake in part-time work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Devlin |first=Kate |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7778383/Raising-tuition-fees-could-leave-medical-students-90000-in-debt.html |title=Raising tuition fees 'could leave medical students ₤90,000 in debt' |publisher=Telegraph |date=29 May 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
The Browne Review published its findings on 12 October 2010. The recommendations include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report.pdf|title=The Browne report: higher education funding and student finance|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Removing the current £3,290 per year cap on the tuition fees that universities can charge to students. There would be no cap on the fees that an institution could charge.
* The government would provide upfront loans to cover tuition fees and living costs of students. [[Means tested]] grants would be available for students from lower income families.
* Students would repay the loans after graduation, and only when they are earning more than £21,000. Repayments would be made at a rate of 9% on any income above £21,000. Any debt not repaid after 30 years would be written off. For comparison, the system at the time demanded repayments of 9% on income above £15,000, and debt was written off after 25 years.
*Part-time students would no longer have to pay upfront tuition fees, and would instead be eligible for loans.

The review rejects the option of a [[graduate tax]], because there would be a large funding gap in the short term. It estimates that if all new students from 2012 paid 3% graduate tax after graduation, the tax would not provide sufficient revenue to fund higher education until 2041–42. This would weaken the independence of universities, which would become entirely dependent on the government for funding. It argues that its own proposals would force universities to improve standards to compete for students: their relationship with students would become more important to universities than their relationship with government.

==Subsequent government proposals==
On 3 November 2010, [[David Willetts]] announced new government proposals following the review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2010/Nov/student-finance |title=student-finance &amp;#124; News &amp; speeches |publisher=BIS |accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposals incorporate many features of Lord Browne’s recommendations: loans would be offered to all students to cover fees, to be repaid only when graduates are earning over £21,000, at a rate of 9%, written off after 30 years; part-time students would be entitled to loans on a similar basis to full-time students; there would be a real interest rate with a progressive taper.

But in a break with the review’s proposals, the government proposed an absolute cap on fees of £9,000 per year. Universities charging fees of over £6,000 per year would be required to contribute to a National Scholarships program. There would be a tougher regime of sanctions encouraging these universities to widen access.

There will be further consultation on early repayment systems, to avoid richer graduates gaining an unfair advantage by ‘buying themselves out’ of the system.

The government intends to implement the changes in time for the 2012/13 academic year.

===Vote on maximum tuition fees===
The Parliamentary vote on increasing the maximum [[tuition fees (UK)|tuition fees]] was held on 9 December 2010, following a [[2010 UK student protests|week of protests]]. The Labour Party opposed the fee increase and Conservatives mostly agreed. Liberal Democrats MPs voted both ways, with 28 voting for, 21 against and 8 not voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2010-12-09&amp;number=150 |title=University Tuition Fee Cap – Raise Upper Limit to £9,000 Per Year |date=9 Dec 2010 |publisher=[[The Public Whip]] |accessdate=10 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal Democrat ministers voted for the change; [[Jenny Willott]] and [[Mike Crockart]] resigned as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|PPS]] to vote against the increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/dec/09/tuition-fees-higher-education |title=Tuition fees: all the votes all the MPs |series=Datablog |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=10 December 2010  |first1=Lisa |last1=Evans |first2=D J |last2=Taylor |date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats [[Simon Hughes]] abstained.

The [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition agreement]] states that "If the response of the Government to Lord Browne’s report is one that Liberal Democrats cannot accept, then arrangements will be made to enable Liberal Democrat MPs to abstain in any vote".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://programmeforgovernment.hmg.gov.uk/universities-and-further-education/ |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100526084809/http://programmeforgovernment.hmg.gov.uk/universities-and-further-education/ |archivedate=26 May 2010 |title=The Coalition: our programme for government: Universities and further education |publisher=UK Government }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]] considered a mass abstention of the Liberal Democrat party on the issue in order to prevent a three-way split within the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/8181410/How-Nick-Clegg-and-Vince-Cable-clashed-over-tuition-fees.html |title=How Nick Clegg and Vince Cable clashed over tuition fees |first=Melissa |last=Kite |date=4 Dec 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2010 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minister responsible for the proposals was Business Secretary and Liberal Democrat [[Vince Cable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hm5aHVcZ78T05aRqNGl_twIIyP2w?docId=N0440201291491853322A |title=MPs urge tuition fee vote delay |publisher=Press Association |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable gave a number of contradictory accounts of whether he would vote in favour or abstain from voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics-news/2010/12/05/labour-slam-vince-cable-over-tuition-fees-farce-as-he-performs-another-u-turn-86908-22763366/ |title=Labour slam Vince Cable over tuition fees 'farce' as he performs another U-turn |date=5 December 2010 |first=Mark |last=Aitken |newspaper=Sunday Mail |location=Scotland |accessdate=10 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[Image:SRWBrightstowe.jpg|thumb|right|Former Liberal Democrat [[Stephen Williams (politician)|Stephen Williams]] criticised the lack of Parliamentary scrutiny of the review panel]]

===Criticisms before the release of the review findings===
The Browne Review has been the subject of several criticisms related to its perceived lack of independence, lack of Parliamentary scrutiny and lack of representativeness.

====Independence====
The independence of the review has been questioned. Lord Browne has been described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' as "one of New Labour's favourite businessmen". Two Vice-Chancellors and a civil servant who advised the government on the introduction of the current fee regime also form part of the team conducting the review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/6532862/Tuition-fees-review-lacks-independence.html |title=Tuition fees review 'lacks independence' |publisher=Telegraph |date=9 November 2009 |accessdate=16 May 2010 | location=London | first=Graeme | last=Paton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' report that Lord Browne is a close friend of [[Reinaldo Avila da Silva]], the long term partner of [[Peter Mandelson]] who appointed Lord Browne to oversee the review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-457914/Mandelsons-partner-linked-Lord-Browne.html |title=Mandelson's partner linked with Lord Browne &amp;#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=27 May 2007 |accessdate=16 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2010 General Election Lord Browne accepted a role as the Government's Lead Non-Executive Director' to advise on the appointment of business leaders to reformed departmental boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/newsroom/news_releases/2010/100630-browne.aspx |title=Lord Browne appointed to key Whitehall role |publisher=Cabinet Office |date=30 June 2010 |accessdate=15 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101110124905/http%3A//www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/newsroom/news_releases/2010/100630%2Dbrowne.aspx |archivedate=10 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sally Hunt]] of the [[University and College Union]] has criticised the independence of Lord Browne in the review process: "Accepting a job from David Cameron, a man who made it quite clear during the election campaign that he wanted university fees to stay, clearly brings the legitimacy of the review's independence into question. In the interest of this review retaining any legitimacy he should resign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Chapman |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1290944/Former-BP-chief-Lord-Browne-brought-axe-jobs-Whitehall.html?ITO=1490 |title=Former BP chief Lord Browne brought in to axe jobs in Whitehall &amp;#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=7 January 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Representativeness====
There is no student representation on the Browne Review: the youngest member of the review panel [[Rajay Naik]] rejected the suggestion that he is a representative of student interests, stating "I don't feel at all as if I represent only the student constituency, just as the other members aren't looking out for special interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Crace |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/feb/09/rajay-naik-higher-education-review |title=Gifted and talented youth &amp;#124; Education |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2010|accessdate=21 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009 Liberal Democrat Universities Spokesperson [[Stephen Williams (politician)|Stephen Williams]] stated: "The lack of student representatives is particularly concerning as it is these people who will really suffer if fees are raised. It is disgraceful that there hasn't been an opportunity to scrutinise the make-up of the review’s panel or its remit in Parliament.”&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/6532862/Tuition-fees-review-lacks-independence.html |title=Tuition fees review 'lacks independence' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 9 November 2009|accessdate=10 November 2009 | location=London | first=Graeme | last=Paton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sally Hunt of the University and College Union criticised the lack of employee representation on the panel, suggesting that, by contrast, business and employer interests had a lot of representation.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt;

====Timing====
The Liberal Democrats criticised the fact that the panel would not report its findings until after the General Election. BBC education journalist [[Mike Baker (journalist)|Mike Baker]] suggested that the Browne Review which had been expected to report in the summer would be delayed until the Autumn so as to avoid opponents causing trouble over fees during the party conference season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker |first=Mike |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10238788.stm |title=Nightmare scenario for universities |publisher=BBC News |date=5 June 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other criticisms====
The National Union of Students warned the review could create a market based system of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nus.org.uk/en/News/News/NUS-to-voice-public-horror-over-plans-to-hike-fees/ |title=NUS to voice public horror over plans to hike fees: News Archive: News And Events |publisher=NUS.org.uk |accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, then NUS President [[Wes Streeting]] stated: "There is a real danger that this review will pave the way for higher fees and a market in prices that would see poorer students priced out of more prestigious universities and other students and universities consigned to the 'bargain basement'".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

In July 2010 Labour MP [[Pat McFadden (British politician)|Pat McFadden]] criticised anonymous briefings from the Conservative Party against the possibility of a [[graduate tax]], a policy which had been mooted by Liberal Democrat Vince Cable. He stated: "It is completely shambolic for the Lib Dem secretary of state to make a speech advocating one policy one week then for a Tory briefing to point in a different direction a week late....Discussion of higher education finance within the coalition is now being governed more by managing the internal politics of the government than the interests of students, universities or the wider taxpayer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-10714585 |title=BBC News – Rejection of graduate tax plans labelled 'shambolic' |publisher=BBC |date= 21 July 2010|accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxford University Student Union]] criticised the fact that the Russell Group's submission the Browne review was confidential with a freedom of information request being rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coughlan |first=Sean |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10088448.stm |title=Oxford students challenge tuition fees review 'secrecy' |publisher=BBC News |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coughlan |first=Sean |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10102574.stm |title=Top universities in Russell Group fees review protest |publisher=BBC News |date= 10 May 2010|accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK Youth Parliament, an affiliate of the British Youth Council also responded to the Browne Review. Their criticism centred around both the way in which the review was conducted and the conclusion it reached. The UK Youth Parliament believed that lifting the cap on University tuition fees would force young people to make "financially driven choices when it comes to choosing where and what to study".

Former Member of UK Youth Parliament and UKYP National Spokesperson [[Harrison Carter]] commented on behalf of the organisation saying:

"Fees themselves are unfair and act as a barrier to education, widening the rich-poor
divide which exists in this country.
I and many other members of
the UK Youth Parliament seriously condemn this action. The news that
fees are set to go up, and that the graduate tax is to be dropped is
truly worrying for young people.

“We are deeply concerned that young people under the age of 18, those whom
increased fees will actually hit, haven’t been adequately consulted about the
proposed changes to university funding.

“Young people up and down the country, starting secondary school, studying for
their GCSEs, or thinking about A-levels – those are the ones who will be making life
changing choices, based on this review and decisions made behind closed doors.
It is essential that the Government demonstrates they are in tune with young
people’s views, by widely consulting under 18 year-olds and establishing the impact
upon this group, before any legislative change to university funding is introduced"&lt;ref&gt;http://harrymyp.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/response-to-the-review-of-higher-education-and-student-finance-in-england-october-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government made the decision to increase University tuition fees to a maximum of £9,000 with a view that higher education institutions should invest some of the extra income from fees above £6,000 in promoting fair access.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/g/11-1046-government-response-to-browne-review&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of subsequent government proposals===
Analysis by the Chartered Institute for Taxation found most graduates will pay off their debt for the rest of their lives if they repay at the lowest possible rate due to the way the debt will increase by RPI inflation plus 3% over the years that the graduates repay it. Someone starting on £21,000 and seeing their salary increase by 5% a year would end up paying £64,239 over 30 years, with an unpaid debt of £26,406 at the end of their working lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Iain Macwhirter |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/iain-macwhirter/students-prepare-for-battle-in-a-looming-new-class-war-1.1067479 |title=Students prepare for battle in a looming new class war |publisher=Herald Scotland |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This also suggests that the national debt may increase rather than fall as a result of the new system.

In 2014 [[Nick Hillman]] of the [[Higher Education Policy Institute]] stated that the government had "got its maths wrong" by overestimating the amount of money students would repay with a £21,000 threshold.&lt;ref name="Rowena Mason"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/mar/21/tuition-fees-former-tory-adviser-government-maths-wrong|title=Tuition fees: former Tory adviser says government got its maths wrong|author=Rowena Mason|work=the Guardian|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guardian have revealed that based on 2014 estimates 45% of student loan debt will never be repaid. If this figure reaches the threshold of 48% then more money would have been collected under the "old" system of £3,000 fees with a lower repayment threshold.&lt;ref name="Rowena Mason"/&gt;

'''Co-coaching''' is a structured practice of [[coaching]] that involves [[peer group|peers]] alike with the ultimate [[goal]] to gain peer knowledge in [[learning]] how to coach or bettering their coaching techniques.  This is usually done with one peer being the coach while the other peer is the [[coachee]] and vice versa during a set amount of time.  This technique enables each peer to receive [[constructive criticism]], or even [[praise]], from one another and also create a better foundation to coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.469.990&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=159|title=Individual and group life coaching: Initial findings from a randomised, controlled trial|journal=Evidence-Based Coaching: Theory, Research and Practice from the Behavioural Sciences|date=2005|volume=1|pages=143–158|author=Anthony Grant, Gordon Spence}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice of co-coaching is especially important in the development within [[management]] and [[sport]]s, as [[leadership]] skills are a priority.

== Forms ==
There are many different forms that one can do to practice co-coaching.  One form involves each individual taking turns to be coach in half hour sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Nemko, [http://www.martynemko.com/articles/co-coaching-quotill-coach-you-if-youll-coach-mequot_id1510 "Co-Coaching: 'I'll Coach You if You'll Coach Me'"]&lt;/ref&gt;  With this example, the coach coaches the coachee for a half hour, while the coachee is being coached.  During this time, the coach practices their coaching techniques, while the coachee ultimately gives [[feedback]] to the coach on how they are doing (both good and bad).  After the coach finishes, the coach becomes the coachee and the previous coachee becomes the coach.  This process of half hour sessions utilizes a quick feedback tool for [[Self-help|self development]] in coaching.  Even though this is one form, other forms with the basic technique of a coach and coachee are applicable so long as each person gets their turn and receives feedback from their own performance from the other individual.

== Sociology ==
Learning from another person, and vice versa, has proven to show a [[Sociology|sociological]] impact in the learning stages.  As one learns in a co-coaching [[Social environment|environment]], the person may feel an ease to learning because of a much more relaxed stage, compared to that of only being coached where they may feel more [[pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/how-do-life/201601/co-coaching-ill-coach-you-if-you-coach-me-redux|title=Co-Coaching: "I'll Coach You if You Coach Me" Redux|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since there is an easement in this learning process, information can easily be addressed from person to person.  This can have a strong impact on the person when it comes to the learning process, but also it can have its drawbacks.  Since it is more relaxed coaching method, the coach is able to make more mistakes, thus having the potential to hurt or slow down the learning method.

Not only can co-coaching be viewed as a sociological aspect, but it can also be categorized in the [[behavior]]al [[terminology]] as well.  Since the coach and coachee are learning coaching techniques from one another, their behavior to the matter is also being altered.  The easiness of each person learning and teaching each other can be an appreciated form that others may use and respond to willingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gifford|first=Kimberly|date=February 2014|title=Doctor Coach: A Deliberate Practice Approach to Teaching and Learning Clinical Skills|url=|journal=Academic Medicine|doi=10.1097/ACM.0000000000000097|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date=May 1, 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach allows the user to integrate their technique into something they seem fit, while at the same time advancing their own skills and mindset as they become the coach/coachee.

As one might use co-coaching as a personal learning experience, co-coaching can also be used as a tool to study people involving the learning process and a working environment.  [[Social science|Social scientists]] can use co-coaching to study the sociological impact that it has to a person, or a group as a whole.  As coaching presents itself as one of the key factors in success, learning the basic techniques into guiding another person is essential in the development and achievement that results in coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cushion|first=Chris|date=28 Sep 2012|title=Coach behaviours and practice structures in youth soccer: Implications for talent development|url=|journal=Journal of Sports Sciences|doi=10.1080/02640414.2012.721930|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date=1 May 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The entire learning process between coaching and learning is what social scientists deem the most important to further advance the learning of human beings on a social status.

Experiments can even be done to determine the best method when dealing with co-coaching.  The coach and coachee are valuable resources in understanding the correlation between the two and how each one advances each other.  As one would usually prove this to be the case as in a face to face altercation, another way this technique could be distributed and tested could be that of the phone and internet.  This way would furthermore advance the social science of learning in a modern-day way and could potentially create a futuristic way in the way people learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stenbom|first=Stefan|date=Oct 2012|title=Student-student online coaching as a relationship of inquiry: an exploratory study from the coach perspective|journal=Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved March 21st, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; Key findings of his research include the following:
* The abolition of [[tracking (education)|tracking]] in [[United States|American]] schools might strongly increase the educational achievements of lower-track students, though this increase would come at the expense of upper-track students (with Laura Argys and Dominic Brewer).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/jpamgt/v15y1996i4p623-645.html Argys, L.M., Rees, D.I., Brewer, D.J. (1996). Detracking America's schools: Equity at zero cost? ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 15(4), pp. 623-645.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Changing some school district leave policies, e.g. increasing the number of unused leave days that teachers can cumulate and "cash in" at retirement may at the same time benefit teachers, students and tax payers (with [[Ronald Ehrenberg]], Randy Ehrenberg, and Eric Ehrenberg).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/uwp/jhriss/v26y1991i1p72-105.html Ehrenberg, D.G. et al. (1991). School District Leave Policies, Teacher Absenteeism, and Student Achievement. ''Journal of Human Resources'', 26(1), pp. 72-105.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Class load characteristics, e.g. [[class size]], number of classes taught, the share of class time spent in areas outside a teacher's certification area - affect job turnover among [[high school]] teachers (with Daniel Mont).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/ecinqu/v34y1996i1p152-67.html Mont, D., Rees, D.I. (1996). The Influence of Classroom Characteristics on High School Teacher Turnover. ''Economic Inquiry'', 34(1), pp. 152-167.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The effects of [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] on earnings in the U.S. are strongly overstated (as e.g. in ''[[The Bell Curve]]'') in the absence of controls for family, socioeconomic background, and academic performance, with aspirations, socialization and role models possibly also playing major roles (with Jeffrey Zax).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v84y2002i4p600-616.html Zax, J.S., Rees, D.I. (2002). IQ, Academic Performance, Environment, and Earnings. ''Review of Economics and Statistics'', 84(4), pp. 600-616.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rees, Benjamin Hansen and D. Mark Anderson fail to find any evidence that the [[legalization of marijuana|legalization of medical marijuana]] leads to increased marijuana use among teenagers in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/amlawe/v17y2015i2p495-528..html Anderson, D.M., Hansen, B., Rees, D.I. (2015). Medical Marijuana Laws and Teen Marijuana Use. ''American Law and Economics Review'', 17(2), pp. 495-528.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* For juveniles, increases in violent crime arrests reduce the likelihood of assault among males, of stealing among females, and of selling drugs for both genders, while local poverty and unemployment raise the propensity to commit crimes, and in particular family poverty increases males' propensity to commit [[robbery]], [[burglary]], and [[theft]] as well as females' propesnity to commit assault and burglary; as these results show that juveniles do respond to incentives and sanctions, employment opportunities, increased family income and stricter deterrence may be effective in reducing [[youth crime|juvenile crime]] (with [[Naci Mocan]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/amlawe/v7y2005i2p319-349.html Mocan, H.N., Rees, D.I.

'''Direct instruction''' ('''DI''') is a general term for the explicit teaching of a skill-set using [[lecture]]s or demonstrations of the material to students. A particular subset of '''direct instruction''', denoted by capitalization as '''Direct Instruction''', refers to a specific example of the approach developed by [[Siegfried Engelmann]] and Wesley C. Becker. DI teaches by explicit instruction,&lt;ref name=LearnLab&gt;[http://www.learnlab.org/research/wiki/index.php/Explicit_instruction] Explicit Instruction. LearnLab. Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center. Retrieved 2017-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to exploratory models such as [[inquiry-based learning]]. DI includes [[tutorial]]s, participatory laboratory classes, [[discussion]], [[recitation]], [[seminar]]s, [[workshop]]s, [[observation]], [[active learning]], [[practicum|practica]], or [[internship]]s.

DI relies on a systematic curriculum design, delivered by implementation of a prescribed [[behavioral script]]. On the premise that all students can learn and all teachers successfully teach if given effective training in specific techniques, teachers may be evaluated based on measurable student learning.

In some special education programs, direct instruction is used in [[resource rooms]], when teachers assist with [[homework]] completion and academic remediation.&lt;ref name=Englert &gt;[http://rse.sagepub.com/content/5/2/38.abstract Effective direct instruction practices in special education settings]. Englert, Carol S. ''Remedial &amp; Special Education'', Vol 5(2), Mar-Apr 1984, 38-47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engelmann's Direct Instruction method and DISTAR ==

The term ''Direct Instruction'' applies specifically to a pedagogical model developed by Siegfried Engelmann in 1964 at the University of Illinois Institute for Research on Exceptional Children.&lt;ref&gt;Engelmann, S. (2007) Teaching Needy Kids in our Backward System.Eugene, OR: ADI Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[DISTAR]] was a specific direct instruction model developed by Siegfried Engelmann and Wesley C. Becker. Engelmann and Becker sought to identify teaching methods that would accelerate the progress of historically disadvantaged elementary school students.&lt;ref&gt;Englemann, S.E.(1968). Relating operant techniques to programming and teaching. ''Journal of School Psychology, 6,'' 89-96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kim &gt;Kim, T. &amp; Axelrod, S. (2005). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26452612_Direct_Instruction_An_Educators'_Guide_and_a_Plea_for_Action Direct Instruction: An Educators’ Guide and a Plea for Action]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 6.(2),'' Page 111-123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DISTAR]], an acronym for '''D'''irect '''I'''nstruction '''S'''ystem for '''T'''eaching '''A'''rithmetic and '''R'''eading, gained prominence during [[Project Follow Through]], the largest educational study ever conducted in America.

Features of DI include:
*Explicit instruction based on lesson plans, often with specific teacher "scripts."
*[[Ability grouping]]. Students are grouped based on their rate of progress through the program.
*Emphasis on pace and efficiency of instruction. Lessons are designed to bring students to mastery as quickly as possible.
*Frequent assessment.
*Embedded professional development/coaching. Program developers recommend careful monitoring and coaching.

Direct Instruction has been effectively delivered through peers to students with [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name=Marchand-Martella &gt;Marchand-Martella, &amp; Martella (2002) [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/3/2/213.pdf&amp;productCode=pa An Overview and Research Summary of Peer-Delivered Corrective Reading]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 3 (2),'' 214 -235&lt;/ref&gt;
Peer delivery offers teachers new ways to use the curriculum.&lt;ref name=Marchand-Martella /&gt; The approach has also been examined as a model to assist students in a [[resource room]] with homework completion, bolster executive functioning skills and improve teacher efficiency.&lt;ref name=Englert /&gt;

==Success for All==
Another popular direct instruction approach is the [[Success for All]] program, which uses [[scripted teaching]] to instruct elementary children in [[phonics]] intensive reading instruction program. What the teacher says is carefully scripted in the program. The program was designed by [[Johns Hopkins University]] professor [[Robert Slavin]] in the mid 1980s for failing schools in [[Baltimore]]. The program requires a dedicated 90 minutes of reading instruction each day in which the teacher must follow a pre-ordained lesson plan that has every minute filled with scripted instruction and specific activities designed to teach reading. [[Jonathan Kozol|Kozol]] criticized the program in his book, ''[[The Shame of the Nation]]'', for being excessively dogmatic, utilitarian, and authoritarian.&lt;ref name=Kozol &gt;{{cite book |last=Kozol |first=Jonathan |date=2005 |title=The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America |url= |location=New York |publisher=Random House |page= |isbn=1-4000-5244-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Debates about the efficacy of DI have raged since before the final results of [[Project Follow Through]] were published; however, there is substantial empirical research supporting its effectiveness. A meta-analysis published by Adams &amp; Engelmann (1996), a chief architect of the DI program, finds a "mean effect size average per study...(as) more than .75, which confirms that the overall effect is substantial."

In some special education programs, it is used in a [[resource room]] with small groups of students. Some research has shown benefit with this model.&lt;ref&gt;Resource Room Teachers' use of Strategies that Promote the Success of Handicapped Students in Regular Classrooms Nancy K. Glomb and Daniel P. Morgan Journal of Special Education, Jan 1991; vol. 25: pp. 221 - 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct Instruction is used with students from every population segment (with regard to poverty, culture, and race). In [[Project Follow Through]], the DI model was ranked first in achievement for poor students, students who were not poor, urban students, rural students, [[African American]] students, [[Hispanic]] students, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] students.  Today, many of the Bureau of Indian Affair's highest-performing schools use Direct Instruction materials. The Baltimore Curriculum Project has many schools with Free and Reduced Lunch Rates above 75% serving student populations that are more than 90% African American. These schools have shown strong achievement gains using Direct Instruction.&lt;ref name=Rebar2007&gt;Rebar, M. (2007).  [http://www.ewu.edu/getset/Academic_Acceleration_G1_TR_2007-1.pdf Academic acceleration in first grade using the Direct Instruction model]. (Report No. 2007-1). Cheney, WA: Eastern Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta-analysis of 85 [[single-subject design]] studies comparing direct instruction to other teaching strategies found the effects to be substantial for students with learning disabilities;&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, H.L. &amp; Sachse-Lee, C. (2000). A Meta-Analysis of Single-Subject-Design Intervention Research for Students with LD. ''Journal of Learning Disabilities,'' Vol. 33, No. 2, 114-136 {{doi|10.1177/002221940003300201}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, when qualified by IQ and reading levels [[strategy instruction]] (SI) had better effects for the high IQ group. For the low-IQ discrepancy groups, higher effect sizes were yielded for a Combined DI and SI Model when compared to all competing models. With the exception of handwriting, DI's effects were all above .8 (i.e., reading and mathematics).{{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

John Hattie's Visible Learning: A Synthesis of Over 800 Meta-Analyses Relating to Achievement (2009) summarizes the results of four meta-analyses that examined Direct Instruction. These analyses incorporated 304 studies of over 42,000 students. Across all of these students, the average effect size was .59 and was significantly larger than those of any other curriculum Hattie studied.{{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

Direct Instruction is recognized as one of two effective models of comprehensive school reform and, in many cases, can be integrated into a tiered model system{{Definition needed|date=May 2016}} to address students with developing problems.&lt;ref name=Stewart &gt;Stewart, R.M.,  Martella, R.C., Marchand-Martella, N.E. &amp;  Benner, G.J. (2005). [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ846760.pdf Three-Tier Models of Reading and Behavior]. ''JEIBI''  2 (3), 115-123&lt;/ref&gt; The findings from [[Project Follow Through]], conducted in a variety of selected communities throughout the United States, suggested that Direct Instruction is the most effective model for teaching academic skills and for affective outcomes (e.g., [[self-esteem]]) of children. Recent large-scale studies (1997–2003), such as the Baltimore Curriculum Project, show that it is possible to help schools that are in the lowest twenty percent with respect to academic achievement steadily improve until they are performing well above average. In some cases, school achievement improved from the 16th percentile to above the 90th percentile.&lt;ref name=Rebar2007/&gt;

==Criticism==
One three-year study of methods of teaching reading showed that highly scripted, teacher-directed methods of teaching reading were not as effective as traditional methods that allowed a more flexible approach.&lt;ref name=Ryder2006&gt;Ryder RJ, Burton JL, Silberg A. 2006. Longitudinal study of direct instruction effects from first through third grade. Journal of Educational Research, 99, 3, 179-191&lt;/ref&gt; Urban teachers in particular expressed great concern over the DI's lack of sensitivity to issues of [[poverty]], [[culture]], and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]].&lt;ref name=Ryder2006/&gt;

The former president of the [[National Science Teachers Association]] (NSTA), Anne Tweed, questioned whether direct instruction was the most effective science teaching strategy. In the December 15, 2004 NSTA Reports she concluded that "direct instruction alone cannot replace the in-depth experience with science concepts that inquiry-based strategies provide."&lt;ref&gt;Tweed, a. (2004). [http://www.nsta.org/publications/news/story.aspx?id=50045 Direct Instruction: Is It the Most Effective Science Teaching Strategy?] ''NSTA Reports'', 15 December 2004. Retrieved 5 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics also see DI as a betrayal of the [[humanism|humanistic]], [[egalitarian]] foundations of public education, or as a "canned" or "teacher proof" curriculum deliverable via unskilled teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-distance.syr.edu/sdlhuman.html From behaviorism to humanism: Incorporating self-direction in learning concepts into the instructional design process.] In H. B. Long &amp; Associates, New ideas about self-directed learning. Norman, OK: Oklahoma Research Center for Continuing Professional and Higher Education, University of Oklahoma, 1994 (Roger Hiemstra &amp; Ralph Brockett)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, where DI has been used in schools among several remote Indigenous Australians communities in Queensland, DI has been criticised for its high cost in return for at best modest improvements in literacy and numeracy levels, as well as its US-centric theme which is alien to indigenous Australian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Misty Adoniou.

'''Duncan Gregory Stroik''' (born January 14, 1962), usually credited as '''Duncan G. Stroik''', is an American architect, Professor of Architecture at the [[University of Notre Dame]] School of Architecture, and founding editor of the ''Sacred Architecture Journal.'' His work continues the tradition of [[classical architecture|classical]] and [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] architecture, also known as [[New Classical Architecture]].

Stroik specializes in all aspects of [[Roman Catholic]] [[sacred architecture]]. In his academic work, Stroik has advocated beauty and tradition as the standards of architecture.{{r|Wiering (2007)}}

==Early life and career==
[[Image:Holy Family Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|Holy Family Chapel, Nebraska]]

Stroik received a [[bachelor's degree]] from the [[University of Virginia School of Architecture]] in 1984 and a [[master's degree]] in architecture from [[Yale School of Architecture]] in 1987. After graduating from Yale, Stroik worked as a designer in the office of [[Allan Greenberg]]. In 1990, Stroik joined the [[Notre Dame School of Architecture]] as a founding faculty member of the school's classical program. In that same year, he founded his firm, Duncan G. Stroik Architect LLC.

==Institute for Sacred Architecture and ''The Sacred Architecture Journal''==
In 1998, Stroik founded the Institute for Sacred Architecture and the ''Sacred Architecture Journal'' as editor. The Institute for Sacred Architecture is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to a renewal of beauty in contemporary church design. Twice yearly, the institute produces the ''Sacred Architecture Journal'', a periodical dedicated to the ongoing discussion of the issues current in the field of sacred architecture.

===Cathedral of Saint Joseph===
[[File:Cathedral of Saint Joseph Sanctuary Baldacchino.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of Saint Joseph Sanctuary]]

The "creative restoration" of this early twentieth century cathedral designed by [[Emmanuel Louis Masqueray]] restored the interior to its former glory.

The barrel vault, arches, and circular motifs are brought to a crescendo in the circular baldacchino that highlights the altar. This circular theme is repeated in the plan of the ambo or pulpit and in the arches at the bishop's cathedra and the high altar. A new decorative marble slab floor was installed throughout the entire church replacing the monochromatic stone tile. Also, as part of this renovation, the mechanical, electrical, sound reinforcement, and lighting systems were replaced or upgraded including new custom chandeliers replicated from photographs of the originals.

===Thomas Aquinas College chapel===
Set in the heart of the [[Thomas Aquinas College]] campus, Our Lady of the Most Holy Trinity Chapel was dedicated on March 7, 2009.&lt;ref name=Chapel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.vcstar.com/news/2009/mar/08/catholic-college-celebrates-new-campus-alumni-to/ |title=News |publisher=Ventura County Star |accessdate=2010-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717190658/http://m.vcstar.com/news/2009/mar/08/catholic-college-celebrates-new-campus-alumni-to/ |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stroik's design for this {{convert|15000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, $23 million chapel references [[Early Christian]], [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Spanish Mission]] and [[Renaissance architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomasaquinas.edu/development/campaign/chapel/name.html |title=Chapel |publisher=Thomas Aquinas College |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stroik designed the chapel as cruciform in shape and featuring both a {{convert|135|ft|m|adj=on}} bell tower and an {{convert|89|ft|m|adj=on}} dome.&lt;ref name="A Sign of Contradiction"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/news/pressroom/inthenews/other/itv_chapel_article.html?id=1743d437-ae50-4171-a727-524f715c653d |title=A Sign of Contradiction |publisher=Inside the Vatican |accessdate=2010-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614041036/http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/news/pressroom/inthenews/other/itv_chapel_article.html?id=1743d437-ae50-4171-a727-524f715c653d |archivedate=2010-06-14 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 [[Pope John Paul II]] blessed the chapel's plans, and in 2008, [[Pope Benedict XV]]I blessed its cornerstone.&lt;ref name=Triumph&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adoremus.org/0409ChurchArchitecture.html |title=Chapel |publisher=Adoremus Bulletin |accessdate=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe===
[[Image:Guadalupe Shrine.jpg|thumb|right|The Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe]]

The [[Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe]], in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]] is the vision of Cardinal [[Raymond Leo Burke]] who wanted to create a national pilgrimage site in the [[Diocese of La Crosse]]. The shrine is situated amidst {{convert|70|acre|m2}} of woodland near the south end of La Crosse. On July 31, 2008 the Shrine Church was dedicated,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacrossetribune.com/articles/2007/12/09/news/00lead.txt La Crosse Tribune - 7.0 : 'Return to Beauty': Shrine could bring international spotlight to La Crosse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacrossetribune.com/articles/2007/12/09/news/00walk.txt La Crosse Tribune - 7.0 : Archbishop dedicates shrine's Rosary Walk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with the dedication Mass presided over by Cardinal Burke, who was joined by Cardinals [[Justin Rigali]] of [[Philadelphia]] and [[Francis George]] of [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guadalupeshrine.org/About/Home.asp Welcome to the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organ case at the Cathedral of Saint Paul===
The organ case at the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul, National Shrine of the Apostle Paul]] draws from the original unbuilt design by [[Emmanuel Louis Masqueray]] but also refines it, preserving the view of the rose window. The existing split organ system was restored and 123 new organ pipes have been installed. The new organ case is constructed of walnut with hand carved detailing and gilding. Two human sized hand carved angels with instruments adorn the organ case while Saint Cecilia, patron saint of music, stands atop the central dome below the rose window. There is choir loft seating between the organ case.

'''''Education for Extinction: American Indians and the Boarding School Experience, 1875–1928''''' is a 1995 history book by David Wallace Adams that covers the history of [[assimilation era]] [[American Indian boarding schools]].

== Synopsis ==

''Education for Extinction'' is an exhaustive history of [[assimilation era]] American Indian education, particularly its boarding schools.&lt;ref name=Heaton/&gt; Adams contends that boarding schools were the federal government's key means for addressing its American Indian issues, and that the schools left a "psychological and cultural mark" on Indian students even while they failed at assimilation.&lt;ref name=Heaton/&gt; He uses published primary and secondary archival sources as evidence combined with anthropological theory.&lt;ref name=Heaton/&gt; The book is divided into four sections: education as the assimilation program's center, American Indian perspective of the program's impact, an analysis of American Indian reaction to boarding schools, and American Indian post-educational experiences and reformer reflections.&lt;ref name=Heaton/&gt;

Reformers sought to change their role from civilizers to assimilators when reservation conditions crumbled.&lt;ref name=Heaton/&gt; This plan for assimilation included provision of dedicated lands, and new legal and educational systems,&lt;ref name=Heaton/&gt; including common schools, day schools on reservation, and boarding schools both on and off reservation.&lt;ref name=Hendrick/&gt; Adams describes boarding schools that "alienated those it claimed to serve" as its "total institution" nature provided acculturation outside standard curriculum.&lt;ref name=Ahern/&gt; While students received instruction in [[the three Rs]] and in farming and domestic areas, Adams shows practices that targeted the students cultures including haircuts, restriction of native language and names, and school uniforms.&lt;ref name=Ahern/&gt; With regard to reformer intent, he summarizes that the "only way to save Indians was to destroy them (culturally)".&lt;ref name=Lindsey/&gt; Adams details the complex reaction to the schools, from hiding children to arguing over certain rules, and the overall acquiescence to the federal role.&lt;ref name=Ahern/&gt; While students expected to become literate and learn new technologies, they often fell ill or died and received fewer benefits than they were promised.&lt;ref name=Ahern/&gt; Adams finds more criticism from lack of "adequate and responsive instruction" than he does towards the schools as a system.&lt;ref name=Ahern/&gt;

== Reception ==

John W. Heaton, writing for ''[[Montana: The Magazine of Western History]]'', praised Adams's balanced presentation between those who assented to the treatment and those children who lived it.&lt;ref name=Heaton/&gt; Heaton criticized the book's lack of new interpretations and conclusions about American Indian education, and its time period's lack of contextualization within the broader history of policy relations.&lt;ref name=Heaton/&gt; He added that the ultimate relationship between policy, ideology, and the student experience was unclear.&lt;ref name=Heaton/&gt; Heaton recommended the book as an introduction to American Indian education.&lt;ref name=Heaton/&gt; In ''Minnesota History'', Wilbert H. Ahern praised Adams' handling of the complex American Indian reaction to boarding schools, and complained that the author didn't cover "the erosion of educational services" well, as declining per pupil expenditures further hurt families' request for more responsiveness.&lt;ref name=Ahern/&gt; Donal Lindsey for ''[[The American Historical Review]]'' called the book "the most comprehensive examination of all federal Indian boarding schools to date".&lt;ref name=Lindsey/&gt; He complemented the book's detail, challenged the author's closeness to the subject, and ultimately proclaimed Adams "the top of his field".&lt;ref name=Lindsey/&gt;

'''Elizabeth (Bauer) Mock''' (later Kassler) (1911 – February 8, 1998) was director of the Department of Architecture and Design at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) and a university professor.&lt;ref name="TownTopics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Treib"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Treib |editor-first=Marc |title=An Everyday Modernism: The Houses of William Wurster |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=University of California Press |year=1995 |page=54 |accessdate=2015-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geiger"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jgonwright.net/MSSMisc1.html |title=In the Cause of Architecture: Commentaries in Memoriam |last=Geiger |first=J.W. |publisher=John W.

Elizabeth "Betty" Bauer Mock Kassler was born in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]] in 1911 as Elizabeth Bauer to Alberta Krouse Bauer, a homemaker, and Jacob Bauer, a New Jersey state highway engineer. Her older sister was [[Catherine Bauer Wurster]], a prominent public housing advocate and urban planning educator, and her younger brother was Louis Bauer. She graduated from the Vail Deane School in 1928.&lt;ref name="TownTopics"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mocavo.com/Town-Topics-Princeton-Feb-18-1998-Volume-Li/465513/44 |title=Obituaries |work=Town Topics |location=Princeton, NJ |date=1998-02-18 |accessdate=2015-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Treib"/&gt; In 1932 she graduated from [[Vassar College]], where she majored in English.&lt;ref name="TownTopics"/&gt;

After college she became one of the first fellows at [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]’s [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin studio]] near [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="Treib"/&gt; It was at Taliesin where she met her first husband, Rudolph Mock, a draftsman from [[Basel, Switzerland]] who worked in Wright’s studio from January 1931 to April 1933.&lt;ref name=" Reed"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" steinerag"/&gt; Rudolph was one of four Taliesin apprentices arrested for horsewhipping C. R. Secrest, who had broken Wright's nose over an employment dispute.&lt;ref name="steinerag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.steinerag.com/flw/Artifact%20Pages/PCSprgGreen.htm#0361.05 |title=The Wright Library |accessdate=2015-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After their marriage, they briefly lived in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Treib"/&gt;

Her involvement with the MoMA started in 1937 when she began working part-time for the museum’s Curator of Architecture and Industrial Design, [[John McAndrew (architect)|John McAndrew]].&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/explore/publications/modern_women/history#lexicon24 |title=Modern Women: A Partial History |publisher=MoMA |accessdate=2015-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later she co-circulated her first exhibition, “What is Modern Architecture?”.&lt;ref name="Treib"/&gt; She became McAndrew’s full-time assistant in 1940. When McAndrew was dismissed in 1942, Mock became the director.&lt;ref name="TownTopics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Treib"/&gt; She remained at MoMA until 1946. During her time there, she produced many exhibits, including: “Built in the U.S.A.: 1932–1944” (1944), “Tomorrow’s Small House: Models and Plans” (1945), and “If You Want to Build a House”.&lt;ref name="Treib"/&gt; She curated seven MoMA exhibitions in total between 1938 and 1946.&lt;ref name="Huneault"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Huneault |editor-first=K. |editor-last2=Anderson |editor-first2=J. |title=Rethinking Professionalism: Women and Art in Canada, 1850–1970 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=2012 |page=209 |accessdate=2015-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, she separated from Rudolph and moved to [[Taliesin West]] with her son Fritz for one season.&lt;ref name="TownTopics"/&gt; In 1949 she became an assistant professor of architectural history and librarian at the [[University of Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="TownTopics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MiamiDaily"&gt;{{cite news |title=New Faculty Name is Added for OU |work=Miami Daily News-Record |date=1949-02-20 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After her divorce, she married Kenneth Stone Kassler in 1951 and moved to [[Princeton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="TownTopics"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Geiger"/&gt; In Princeton she continued to write for architecture journals, the MoMA, and popular magazines.&lt;ref name="TownTopics"/&gt; Kassler died in 1964, the same year Bauer became a [[research associate]] at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning at [[Princeton University]]. She served in that role until 1971.&lt;ref name="TownTopics"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Taliesin Fellowship, A Directory of Members.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Kassler's 1981 directory of Taliesin Fellowship members]] --&gt;
According to [[Concordia University]]'s Research Chair in Art History, Kristina Huneault, Mock's books "strove to persuade a new generation of homebuyers of how modernism might improve their lives and the quality of North American architectural culture overall.”&lt;ref name=" Huneault"/&gt; They include ''If You Want to Build a House'' (1946), ''The Architecture of Bridges'' (1949), and ''Modern Gardens and the Landscape'' (1964, known then as Elizabeth B. Kassler).

Her book on bridges is described by [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] as "the first major book on bridges to give a modern viewpoint."&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Billington |first=D.P. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Bridge |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/79272/bridge/72077/Additional-Reading |year=2015 |accessdate=2015-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Modern Gardens and the Landscape'' is considered the authoritative survey of its subject.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; It was billed by the MoMA as "the first book to discuss the relationship between the modern garden and the natural landscape in terms of contemporary aesthetics."&lt;ref name="MoMA-pressrelease"&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/3356/releases/MOMA_1964_0143_1964-12-11_95.pdf?2010 |format=PDF |title=Modern Gardens and the Landscape by Elizabeth B. Kassler |publisher=MoMA |date=1964-12-11 |accessdate=2015-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Modern Gardens and the Landscape'' included the works of [[Burle Marx]], [[Bernard Rudofsky]], [[Gunnar Asplund]] and [[Luis Barragan]].&lt;ref name="Deckker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deckker |first1=Z.Q. |title=Brazil Built: The Architecture of the Modern Movement in Brazil |location=London, England |publisher=Spion Press |date=2001 |page=169 |accessdate=2015-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her books were all published by the Museum of Modern Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Treib |first1=M. |title=An Everyday Modernism: The Houses of William Wurster |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=University of California Press |year=1995 |page=81 |accessdate=2015-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1979 visit to [[Taliesin West]] inspired her to put together a retrospective directory of the Taliesin Fellowship in time for its 50th anniversary (in 1982). She collected all the listings herself, and in 1981 published 450 copies of ''The Directory, 1932–1982, The Taliesin Fellowship, A Directory of Members''. This was the first such directory in Taliesin history and it inspired the [[Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation]] to develop similar directories.&lt;ref name="Geiger2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jgonwright.net/ep01Fellows.html |title=My First Summer at the Fellowship |last=Geiger |first=J.W. |publisher=John W. Geiger Collection for the Study of Organic Architecture |date=2010 |accessdate=2015-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 she retired to a [[retirement community]] in Lexington, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="TownTopics"/&gt;

'''Enrica Clay Dillon''' (June 22, 1885 – October 9, 1946) was an American [[opera singer]], [[opera director]], and [[voice teacher]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1946/10/10/archives/enrica-clay-dillon-sang-in-1800-operas.html?sq=%2522Marie+Sundelius%2522&amp;scp=101&amp;st=p  "Enrica Clay Dillon, Sang in 1,800 Operas," ''New York Times'' (Oct. 10, 1946), p. 27.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Born in 1885 in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]],&lt;ref&gt;''Social Security Applications and Claims Index'', 1936-2007. Date: Oct 1940; Name: Enrica Clay Dillon; Birth Date: 22 Jun 1885; Birth Place: Denver, Colorado; Father: Henry C Dillon; Mother: Florence Hood&lt;/ref&gt; Dillon was the daughter of Judge Henry Clay Dillon and Florence (''née'' Hood) Dillon. She was the older sister of composer Fanny Dillon {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} and actress [[Josephine Dillon]]; the latter of whom was married to [[Clark Gable]] for 6 years.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Dillon studied voice at [[Mount Holyoke College]] and with baritone [[Francesco Mottino]] in [[Milan]]. She had a prolific career as a [[dramatic soprano]] in Europe during the first decade and a half of the 20th century, giving more than 1,800 opera performances. She was especially active in Italy and sang at most of the principle houses in that country, including [[La Scala]]. She was particularly known for her portrayal of the title role in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]''.&lt;ref name=var&gt;Enrica Clay Dillon obituary, ''Variety'' (October 16, 1946), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dillon abandoned her singing career shortly before the outbreak of [[World War I]]; largely due to continual bouts with illness. She then served as the first director of the [[Washington National Opera (1919–1936)|Washington Opera Company]] from 1919 to 1927. She moved to [[Philadelphia]] in 1927, where for three years she taught singing and was director of the [[Philadelphia Operatic Society]]. From 1930-35, she worked for [[Herbert Witherspoon]] as a vocal coach and stage director at first the [[Chicago Civic Opera]] and then the [[Chicago Grand Opera Company]]. She also maintained a home in New York City during the 1930s where she had a voice studio and directed operas for the [[New York Singing Teachers Association]] and the [[New York Opera Guild]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Beginning in 1916, Dillon spent her summers in the state of [[Maine]] where she ran an opera and voice training program for aspiring singers at [[Frederick Bristol]]'s music camp just outside [[Harrison, Maine]]. Her regular students from Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City would often come up with her to study at the school. Among her notable pupils were [[Richard Crooks]], [[Marie Sundelius]], [[Kathryn Meisle]], and [[Frederick Jagel]], and musical theatre actress Evelyn Herbert.&lt;ref name=var/&gt;

In 1936, Dillon founded the [[Deertrees Theatre]] in [[Harrison, Maine|Harrison]], which was later the home of Dillon's [[Deertree Opera Company]] (DOC). The DOC presented its first season in 1940. Many theatres were closed down during [[World War II]], and the opera company only presented three seasons of performances before the theatre was closed in 1942. [[Metropolitan Opera]] conductor [[Karl Kritz]] served as the company's music director and primary conductor. [[Hermann Weigert]] also served on the company's conducting staff. Notable singers to have performed with the company included a young [[Astrid Varnay]] just prior to her triumphant Met debut and soprano [[Elisabeth Carron]] in her professional opera debut.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Death==
At the time of her death in [[Harrison, Maine]], Dillon was in the midst of organizing a summer opera festival to be held in July 1947, after already presenting a summer opera festival in 1946, at the re-opened Deertree Theatre.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

[[File:US Navy 120119-N-GZ832-006 Chief Damage Controlman Ty Griffin proctors the chief petty officer exam aboard the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Ca.jpg|thumb|An invigilator overseeing an exam in the US Navy]]
An '''exam invigilator''', '''exam proctor''' or '''exam supervisor''' is someone who is appointed by the examination board and services for maintaining the proper conduct of a particular [[Test (assessment)|examination]] in accordance with the exam regulations. It is the duty of the exam invigilator to watch the examination candidates to prevent [[cheating]] during the examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/invigilator|title=invigilator|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are required to ensure that all the exams are carried out according to the rules set out by the exam board which allows each candidate to sit for the examination under equal conditions as other candidates throughout the country.

Exam Invigilators are appointed to a position of trust and they should possess the quality of integrity and vigilance to conduct the examinations in exact accordance with the examination board’s instructions. They are appointed by different educational institutions to help prepare and carry out the examination procedures according to their rules and regulations of the [[examination board]].

==Purposes==
The purpose of exam invigilation is to ensure that all [[candidate]]s are under active [[surveillance]] for every moment of the duration of the examination. Invigilators should also try to provide a suitably pleasant and supportive atmosphere for candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/13/exam-invigilator-what-thinking|title=What I'm really thinking: the exam invigilator|first=|last=Anonymous|date=13 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they must also ensure and prevent any kind of communication between candidates (by copying, whispering or any kind of signal, exchange of paper or objects) and any kind of access to books, papers or electronic media of any kind (unless specifically authorized) for the exam duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britishcouncil.org/2.-invigilators---code-of-practice-all-exams.doc | title=British Council Invigilators Job requirements - Job description / Code of Practice | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714121209/https://www.britishcouncil.org/2.-invigilators---code-of-practice-all-exams.doc | archivedate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invigilators also need to ensure the security of the examination hall before, during and after the examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/nctl/examsadmin/b00197212/examcycle-/exam-prep/invigilation-|title=Exams administration: information for exam centres - Detailed guidance - GOV.UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the moment the question papers are given out until all answers are collected, exam invigilators should [[patrol]] vigilantly. Particular emphasis should be given to multiple-choice and short-answer questions. The main goal should be to prevent possible candidate [[malpractice]] and administrative failures.

==Invigilators required for exams==
The minimum number of invigilators required for different kinds of examinations depends on the type of examinations held.  For general written examinations, there should be at least one invigilator present against every 30 students for patrolling and vigilance at the examination hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ask.cie.org.uk/system/selfservice.controller?CONFIGURATION=1035&amp;PARTITION_ID=1&amp;USERTYPE=1&amp;CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&amp;ARTICLE_ID=5292 | title=Invigilators FAQs | publisher=Cambridge International Examinations | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714221425/http://ask.cie.org.uk/system/selfservice.controller?CONFIGURATION=1035&amp;PARTITION_ID=1&amp;USERTYPE=1&amp;CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&amp;ARTICLE_ID=5292 | archivedate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties of an exam invigilator==

===Before the exam===
Before the start of the examination, exam invigilators must be fully briefed and trained before carrying out the task of invigilation in their respective venues. It is essential that exam invigilators familiarize themselves with the appropriate examination regulations and procedures before attending the examination hall.

Exam invigilators should arrive at the examination hall at least one hour before the start of the examination to report for their duty and remain for an additional hour after the exams to collect and wrap up the examination scripts.

Before the candidates arrive, exam invigilators must prepare the examination venue by placing the required answer booklets, [[reference]] booklets, candidate numbers and other supplementary materials on candidates' desks. They must make sure that the time of the clock at the examination venue is set correctly and necessary instructions are clearly displayed at the front of the examination hall for the candidates. They should also help direct students to their seats and prohibit the entrance of forbidden items such as cell phones, smart watch, headphones, portable audio/video/gaming devices and textbooks at the examination hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-an-invigilator-do.htm|title=What does an Invigilator do? (with pictures)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===During the exam===
During the examination, all exam invigilators must give their whole attention to the examination process. At this time, they must be vigilant, mobile and attentive and should not perform any other tasks throughout the examination’s duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://express-invigilators.co.uk/role_6.html | title=Express Invigilators | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201014615/http://express-invigilators.co.uk/role_6.html | archivedate=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, exam invigilators must respond to queries from candidates immediately and assist the candidates as per their needs. Within the first 30 minutes of the examination, the invigilators should take the attendance of the candidates in the attendance record sheet and sign it before submitting it to the Chief Invigilator. While checking the attendance, they must also check the candidate's name, candidate number, passport, admit card or examination entrance card etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.careerpath360.com/index.php/how-to-be-a-school-exam-invigilator-15479/|title= How to be a School Exam Invigilator|date= June 23, 2009|publisher=careerpath360.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628135521/http://www.careerpath360.com/index.php/how-to-be-a-school-exam-invigilator-15479/|archivedate= June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exam invigilators must deal with students who arrive late at the examination venue and record their attendance and [[consult]] with the Chief Invigilator to determine whether extra time will be granted to such candidates or not.

Invigilators must not permit candidates to leave the examination hall room during the first 1-hour and the last 15 minutes of the examination. They should also take immediate actions in case of candidates caught cheating during the examination and report to the Chief Invigilator. If [[unauthorized]] materials are found inside the examination hall, they should remove them immediately. In the event of an emergency or fire alarm, invigilators should follow the  emergency exit procedures and lead the candidates safely outside the examination hall.

Invigilators must be as quiet as possible during the examination duration but also remain vigilant to the candidates. They should not explain any questions asked by the candidates or allow any other person to ask questions of, or read answers to, the candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weblearneng.com/invigilator|title=Invigilator - English Language Tutorials|date=February 13, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the exam===
After the examination is over, the exam invigilators should collect the scripts, question papers, stationery and other reference booklets from the candidates and check that all the required information (name, candidate number, venue, date etc.) have been filled out by the candidates on their scripts properly. When all the scripts are collected, invigilators should release candidates and direct them towards the exit of the examination hall in complete silence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="122230">The '''Ford Hall Forum''' is the oldest free public lecture series in the [[United States]].  Founded in 1908, it continues to host open lectures and discussions in the [[Greater Boston]] area.  Some of the more well-known past speakers include [[Maya Angelou]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Alan Dershowitz]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Al Gore]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[Cokie Roberts]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Jimmy Wales]], and [[Gwen Ifill]].

The Ford Hall Forum's mission is "to promote freedom of speech and foster an informed and engaged citizenry through the free public presentation of lectures, debates, and discussions."  Its events strive to illuminate key issues facing society by bringing to a public podium knowledgeable and thought-provoking speakers.  These speakers are presented in person, for free, and in settings that facilitate frank and open debate.  All programs provide equal time for speakers' remarks and questions from the audience.

==History==
The Forum was founded  in February 1908 by George W. Coleman, a [[Boston]] businessman and then leader of the Boston Baptist Social Union. The first public lectures were held in the Union's meeting place, the Ford Building on [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]], from where the Forum's name originates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordhallforum.org/about.html About the Ford Hall Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a free speech institution that does not endorse the view of any of its speakers, the Forum has occasionally given a stage to speakers who other institutions would, or could, not. In 1929, [[Margaret Sanger]] appeared at the Forum, visibly gagged,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noble|first=William|title=Bookbanning in America : who bans books?--and why?|year=1990|publisher=P.S. Eriksson|location=Middlebury, Vt.|isbn=0839710801|pages=84|chapter=Frolicking in Ford Hall}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 May 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; after Mayor [[James Michael Curley]] issued an injunction barring her from speaking about family planning.  Around the same time, the Forum withstood criticism for hosting meetings with civil rights activist, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. [[Malcolm X]] was invited to speak in the 1960s at a time when he was widely considered too dangerous to be given a public podium in the heart of Boston. In the early 1990s, when former [[Ku Klux Klan]] leader [[David Duke]] was nearly elected to a seat in the U.S. Senate, the Forum brought him to Boston to answer questions about his views and about his past.

Ousted by the Boston Baptist Social Union for fear of being associated with radicalism, the Ford Hall Forum began its own separate enterprise in 1929.   The stated purpose of the new corporation was:
"To provide education such as will develop intelligent, capable, and responsible citizens, minister to the welfare of all, and promote understanding of civic, moral, religious, and spiritual responsibilities. This can be done in part by maintaining a common meeting ground for all the people where there will be full, free, and open public discussion of all vital questions affecting human welfare."

Periodically, the Forum specifically recognizes the value of expressing sentiment that may not always be welcomed but is certainly necessary with its First Amendment Award in honor of Louis P. and Evelyn Smith, long time active benefactors of the Forum.  Recipients are listed below along with other speakers.

For many years the Ford Hall Forum was based at [[Northeastern University]], the Ford Hall Forum currently is presenting its lecture series in cooperation with [[Suffolk University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2918">'''George James Lambert''' (17 December 1900 - 13 September 1971) was an English [[baritone]] and [[voice teacher]] who was primarily active in Canada.

Lambert was born in [[Long Preston]].  Following [[World War I]], he studied singing in his native country with [[Frederic Lord]] while concurrently playing soccer professionally. He was highly active as an [[oratorio]] singer in England during the early 1920s. In 1923 he relocated to Rome where he studied [[opera]] with Alfredo Martino. He made his professional opera debut in Rome soon after as Giorgio Germont in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[La Traviata]]''. He returned to England where he became a frequent soloist on [[BBC Radio]] during the late 1920s. During this time [[Sir Henry Wood]] was his vocal coach.

Lambert relocated to Canada in the early 1930s to continue vocal studies with Lord who now resided in Ontario. He performed in concerts with symphony orchestras and with opera companies in many Canadian cities during the 1930s and 1940s. He was particularly active as a soloist with the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]] (TSO); notably performing the [[Vox Christi|part of Christus]] in the TSO's annual presentations of [[Bach]]'s ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' with conductor [[Sir Ernest MacMillan]] and the [[Toronto Mendelssohn Choir]] every year from 1938-1945. One of his final performances was as Cathva in the world premiere [[Healey Willan]]'s opera ''[[Deirdre (opera)|Deirdre]]'' which was broadcast live on [[CBC Radio]] on 20 April 1946.

Lambert retired from the stage in 1946 and thereafter dedicated his life to teaching. He had joined the voice faculty of the [[Toronto Conservatory of Music]] in 1932, and he continued to teach there until his death nearly 40 years later. A large number of his pupils have had successful singing careers, including [[Léonard Bilodeau]], [[Jean Bonhomme]], [[Pierre Boutet]], [[Victor Braun]], [[John Dodington]], [[Audrey Farnell]], [[Don Garrard]], [[Robert Goulet]], [[Doreen Hume]], [[Gwenlynn Little]], [[Phyllis Mailing]], [[Ermanno Mauro]], [[Joan Maxwell]], [[David Mills (bass)|David Mills]], [[Peter Milne (baritone)|Peter Milne]], [[Bernard Turgeon]], [[Jon Vickers]], [[Alan Woodrow]], and [[Lesia Zubrack Romanoff]]. He died in 1971 at the age of 70 in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/george-lambert-emc/|title=George Lambert|work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|author=Godfrey Ridout}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 he was appointed an [[assistant professor]] of instructional technology at [[Syracuse University]], and remained there until 1985, being promoted to [[associate professor]] in 1979. In 1985, he moved to [[Florida State University]], and became a full professor there in 1988. He retired as Emeritus Professor of Instructional Technology and Educational Psychology in 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==ARCS model==

Keller is best known for the ARCS ("Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction") model of instructional design, which he first introduced in 1979. He developed the model in response to previous [[Behaviorism|behaviourist]] and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] approaches to instructional design which Keller argued focused too much on external stimuli and paid insufficient attention to learners' motivation. His ARCS model broke learner motivation down into four components (attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction) and provided strategies for instructors to incorporate each into their courses, thereby encouraging learner motivation. The ARCS model has been widely applied and became a "central reference"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; for subsequent research into learner motivation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ericdigests.org/1998-1/motivation.htm|title=Motivation in Instructional Design|last=Small|first=Ruth V.|date=1998-01-01|work=ERIC Digests|language=English|access-date=2016-10-10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knowledge Bowl''' is the name for several interdisciplinary academic [[quiz bowl]]-like competitions across the [[United States]] and the world. The questions for many Knowledge Bowl competitions are supplied by the [[Academic Hallmarks]] company of [[Durango, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greatauk.com/Secrets.html|title=Secrets of Successful Knowledge Bowls|publisher=Academic Hallmarks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Knowledge Bowl meet formats are mostly similar across the United States, there are a few regional differences. Knowledge Bowl usually involves teams of four to six students trying to answer questions in a written round and several oral rounds.&lt;ref name="MN Coaches Handbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsc.org/cms/lib6/MN01001004/Centricity/Domain/47/KB%20Handbook%2013-14%20Final%20PDF.pdf|title=Coaches' Handbook - Minnesota Service Cooperatives Senior High Knowledge Bowl|year=2014|accessdate=January 2, 2014|website=Lakes Country Service Cooperative}}&lt;/ref&gt; No team is eliminated in this event, and every team participates in every round. Knowledge Bowl is usually a power competition in which team groupings are rearranged after each round on the basis of their total points accumulated.{{where|date=July 2014}} The written round is a multiple-choice exam taken by each team as a whole. Results of this round are used for seeding teams in the oral rounds. Oral rounds involves three teams per room and uses an electronic [[lock-out device]] system. A reader presents the questions, and a team member may buzz in as soon as he or she chooses. If they miss a question, nothing is deducted, but the other teams then may try to answer the question based on who buzzed in first. The winner is the team with the greatest number of points at the end of the meet.

==Knowledge Bowl in Colorado==
{{Main article|Colorado State Knowledge Bowl Meet}}

===History===
Knowledge Bowl originated in 1976 as a project within the San Juan Board of Cooperative Services in [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]], [[Colorado]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} It began in response to a group of area student body leaders who asked if the organization would develop and host some kind of competitive academic activity involving excellent students.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The first meet held in [[Pagosa Springs]] involved just three high schools.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Within two years, it evolved to include scores of invitational meets in addition to regional competitions and a Colorado state championship that has been held annually ever since.

The first statewide Colorado State Knowledge Bowl was held in 1978 at [[Fort Lewis College]] in Durango.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Most of the competing teams that year came from schools in mountain districts. {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} One of the few [[Colorado Front Range|Front Range]] schools in the competition that year, Green Mountain High School in [[Jefferson County Public Schools (Colorado)|Jefferson County]], won the first statewide championship.&lt;ref&gt;http://sc.jeffco.k12.co.us/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectionid=294&lt;/ref&gt; Green Mountain would go on to triumph in three of the first four years of the competition, taking first place in 1980 and 1981 as well.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The event soon attracted educators from [[Minnesota]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and [[South Dakota]] who initiated Knowledge Bowl programs in their home states.

From 1983 to 2012, Colorado teams also participated in a Colorado-specific [[Knowledge Master Open]] (KMO) online competition. Teams answered the entire set of 200 questions together, earning a score from 0 to 2000. Each school sent in their scores and in a few weeks received a summary of how the school fared against other Colorado schools. Colorado KMO, along with the KMO program as a whole, was discontinued after the 2012-2013 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Knowledge Master Open|url=http://www.greatauk.com/KMO.html|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meet Format===
In [[Colorado]], the meets start off with the written round.  This round comprises 40 or 60 multiple choice questions that the team attempts to answer correctly. The team can discuss the question only during the written round. Depending on the school, the team may have between three and eight people, however only four will compete in the written round. The scores from the written round determines which teams will compete against each other in the first oral round.

Following the written round teams compete in four oral rounds of forty or fifty questions each during which three teams compete against each other in a single room. Similarly to the written round, only four members of a team may take part in these rounds, but player substitutions may occur in after the first half of the questions. The subject line is read before the question. Teams can buzz at any time, even before the reader has finished reading the question. The team may not talk about the answer to the question, but they may talk about who will answer the question (In the Colorado Springs area meets, no talking period is allowed. However, teammates may use hand signals to determine who will answer). A sheet of paper is allowed for computations and for keeping score. If the first team to buzz in fails to answer the question in 15 seconds or answers incorrectly and no other team has buzzed in either of the other two teams may ask the reader to finish the question and/or repeat the question only once. After each round the scores are totaled and the teams reorganized and assigned to rooms according to their scores. After the final round, the team with the highest score wins the meet.

==Knowledge Bowl in Minnesota==

===History===
Knowledge Bowl was initiated in Minnesota by David Heritage, an administrator in the Hibbing Public Schools.&lt;ref name="Hibbing High School Class of 1988"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hibbing High School Class of 1988|url=http://www.hibbinghighschool1988.com/index.cfm/yearbook.htm|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   While working with exceptional students in his district, he wished to find a greater challenge.  After contacting other schools around the country to see what was done to challenge their best students, as a result Heritage started the first Knowledge Bowl competitions in the state.&lt;ref name="Hibbing High School Class of 1988"/&gt;  Mr. Heritage is memorialized for his founding contributions at the State Knowledge Bowl tournament in the Heritage Spirit award.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  The first Minnesota Knowledge Bowl competition was started by the Lakes Country Service Cooperative of [[Fergus Falls]], [[Minnesota]], in 1979. The first season featured teams from only eight [[List of school districts in Minnesota|school districts]] in western Minnesota. Today, Knowledge Bowl has grown to include over 800 teams from across the state and is sponsored by the 11 Service Cooperatives of the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minnesota Knowledge Bowl Champions|url=http://northernmn.wdio.com/news/community-spirit/minnesota-knowledge-bowl-champions/46409|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meet Format===
Although there is some variation from region to region, most Knowledge Bowl meets follow the same general format. There are two rounds at a KB meet, a Written Round and an Oral Round.&lt;ref name="successbeyond KB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.successbeyond.org/documents/KB_senior_snapshot.pdf |title=Overview: Senior High Knowledge Bowl 2014 - 2015 |accessdate=November 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222018/http://www.successbeyond.org/documents/KB_senior_snapshot.pdf |archivedate=March  3, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The written round (WR) consists of usually 60 multiple-choice questions with five possible answers listed. In the written round, all five members of the team may confer throughout the duration of the round.&lt;ref name=MPR&gt;{{cite web|last=Julin|first=Chris|title=The Knowledge Bowl|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200010/25_julinc_knowledgebowl-m/|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the oral rounds (OR), only four team members are allowed to participate. Thus, if a team has five members, one must sit out during the oral round. Oral rounds consist of three sets of 15 questions, 45 in total. Some regions play four oral rounds in a meet, others five. Oral rounds feature three teams in one room competing against each other for points. Teams may buzz in at any point during the question. However, they must then answer with whatever information has been given them. If a team buzzes in before the question is read in its entirety, the reader will reread the question for the other team(s), provided they have not yet buzzed in themselves. (The buzzer system is usually set up to have the teams buzz in the style of the game show ''[[Split Second (game show)|Split Second]]'', i.e., the teams are called on in the order that they register in the game computer.)  Each team in a round has one designated spokesperson.  The spokesperson is the only person who is allowed to answer during the 15 second time limit.  The spokesperson has the ability to defer their answer to another person on their team as long as they do so before the 15 second time limit.

Some regions randomly assign teams to play each other over the course of a meet, while others use "power ranking". Power ranking is simply the process whereby the top three teams are placed together in one room, the next three in another, and so on. While not all regions use the power ranking method, it is used in the [[Minnesota State Knowledge Bowl Meet|Minnesota Service Cooperatives' State Knowledge Bowl Meet]].  In 2006, several regions tested a "Strength of Schedule" (SOS) meet format at meets using Power Ranking, and in 2007, this was made the official format.  Using SOS, a team will receive a 1.5 point bonus for every round it spends in room 1, a 1-point bonus for every round in room two, and a .5 point bonus for every round in room three.  The SOS points are not added to a team's score until after all of the oral rounds.  In 2007, SOS was made official Knowledge Bowl procedure, and will be used at the state tournament.

In the [[Marshall, Minnesota|Marshall Region]], the written round is dispensed with until sub-regions. Each meet consists of 3 oral rounds of 45 questions each.  The four-person limit is also not enforced until the sub-region meet. The SOS system is also in place; however, because there is no written round, no SOS points are assigned for the first round.

===Postseason===
All the regions throughout Minnesota utilize various postseason formats to select the teams that will represent their region at the state meet. Following the completion of the regular season, the region hosts a sub-regional tournament. In some regions, teams have to qualify by finishing high enough in the standings, while in others, all the teams in the region qualify for Sub-Regions. Following Sub-Regions, a certain number of teams advance to Regions. In some regions, the top teams receive a bye through Sub-Regions straight to Regions, while in others, every team has to qualify through Sub-Regions. At Regions, teams compete for that region's allotted number of State berths.

The 48 teams that qualify for State are ordered by enrollment and then evenly divided, with the larger 24 in Class AA, and the smaller 24 in Class A. All schools from the Metro Region (XI) are automatically placed in Class AA. If one private school qualifies, it is automatically placed in Class AA, regardless of size. If two private schools qualify, the larger is placed in Class AA, and the smaller in Class A. If three private schools qualify, the larger two are placed in Class AA, and the smallest is placed in Class A, and so on. The [[Minnesota State Knowledge Bowl Meet|State meet]] is held in late April at Cragun's Resort in [[Brainerd, Minnesota|Brainerd]].

===Regions===
These are the ten/eleven regions throughout the state of Minnesota, and the city in which they are headquartered:

Northwest (I/II),&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;While the Northwest Region is designated Regions I &amp; II, it is essentially one region, with all the teams from Northwest Minnesota participating in it.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thief River Falls, Minnesota|Thief River Falls]];
Northeast (III), [[Mountain Iron, Minnesota|Mountain Iron]];
Lakes Country (IV), [[Fergus Falls, Minnesota|Fergus Falls]];
North Central (V), [[Staples, Minnesota|Staples]];
West Central/Southwest (VI/VIII),&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;While the West Central and Southwest Regions are both headquartered in Marshall and operated under the same auspices, they are essentially separate regions in which teams from their respective region participate apart from teams in the other region.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshall, Minnesota|Marshall]];
Central (VII), [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]];
South Central (IX), [[North Mankato, Minnesota|North Mankato]];
Southeast (X), [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]];
Metro (XI), [[St. Anthony Village, Minnesota|St. Anthony]].

&lt;references group="nb"/&gt;

===State Tournament===
{{Main article|Minnesota State Knowledge Bowl Meet}}
The Minnesota Knowledge Bowl state tournament is held annually at Cragun's resort in [[Brainerd, Minnesota|Brainerd]], [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="MN Coaches Handbook"/&gt; The tournament is a two-day event, with the first day consisting of a banquet dinner and the written round, and the second day comprising five oral rounds.&lt;ref name="MN Coaches Handbook"/&gt;

==Knowledge Bowl in Washington State==
{{Main article|Washington State Knowledge Bowl Tournament}}

===History===
Imported from [[Colorado]], the first Knowledge Bowl in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] for high school students in grades nine through twelve was conducted by the Olympic Educational Service District 114 in 1981. Within several years, each of the nine [[Educational Service Districts in Washington|Educational Service Districts]] were holding regional competitions and the first statewide tournament was held in 1984.

===Regional Competitions===
Regional competitions are held between November and early March. Each ESD decides the format that will be used in their respective regions and how many regional competitions will be held.

The regional competitions that determine which teams will advance to the state tournament typically take place in February or early March. The number of teams each ESD region is allotted for the state tournament varies each year with the number of schools that compete at each division (based on [[Washington Interscholastic Activities Association]] classification) in each region. The top 18 teams in Divisions 4A, 2A, 1A, and 2B (top 12 in Divisions 3A and 1B) advance to the state tournament.

===State Tournament===
The state tournament takes place annually in March. The format for the state tournament begins with a written round of 50 multiple-choice questions with a 35-minute time limit. This is followed by four Preliminary oral rounds of 50 questions each, setting the stage for the Semi-Final and Championship rounds, also oral rounds of 50 questions each.

==International Knowledge Bowl Competitions==

===Knowledge Bowl in Europe===

Knowledge Bowl is sponsored internationally by the [[Central and Eastern European Schools Association]] (CEESA) at the middle school and high school level. Due to the large number of teams entering, each competition is split between two European cities.{{which|date=August 2014}} Additionally, two small Knowledge Bowl competitions are held in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]].

===Knowledge Bowl in Central America===

Knowledge Bowl is also organized in Central America by [[Association of American Schools in Central America]] (AASCA), and is limited to AASCA schools. International level competition is held in mid November and features schools from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. The national level dates vary depending on the country, and are also held once a year. The national levels are also limited to American schools; the Honduran Knowledge Bowl nationals are organized by Association of Bilingual Schools of Honduras (ABSH) and are also limited to ABSH. In El Salvador, the national competition is organised by the Association of Bilingual Schools of San Salvador, for its five member institutions. Four are American and one is British.

In 2008, 2009, and 2010, the event was won by [[Colegio Maya]] of Guatemala for the junior varsity level, the most consecutive titles in the event's history. In 2011 and 2012 the title of varsity champions was won by the [[Escuela International de Tegucigalpa]] (EIT), with an outstanding performance of the two time MVP, Ricardo Cálix, becoming the first consecutive winner of the award in the history of Knowledge Bowl World Championships.

In 2018, the National Knowledge Bowl, organised by ABSH (Association of Bilingual Schools in Honduras) was won by Macris School, which managed to win first places in the Varsity category and the Junior Varsity category, as well as second place in the Middle School category.

====Meet Format====
Schools that participate in the tournaments are randomly seeded into groups, and the number of groups vary depending on how many schools participate. For example, if in a certain year 20 schools participate, 4 groups of 5 schools are made. In every group, the first and second placed groups would proceed to a quarter-final elimination round. Position within the group is decided by how many points a group has accumulated while playing other teams (in every group, every team must play all of the other teams in the group once).

A team is composed of five students, four of whom participate in a game lasting thirty minutes. After every thirty-minute game, substitutions can be made. In every game, only two teams compete against each other. After the thirty minutes are up, the game enters the lightning round (see below), a set of five final questions with mildly altered rules. If after the lightning round, there is still a tie between the two teams, the game enters a sudden-death mode, in which the first person to gain any amount of points wins, but a team that loses a point also loses the match.

For a normal, toss-up question, a team that buzzes in and answers correctly gains two points and a bonus question. In toss-up questions, team members are not allowed to communicate with each other, and are given 10 seconds to buzz in, and 30 seconds plus the use of scratch paper if the question is a math question. If a team member buzzes in and answers incorrectly, the team loses one point, and the question is repeated for the second team to answer. This is called a rebound. In rebounds, an additional 10 seconds are given for the second team, and team members can communicate with each other, but only the team captain can declare the answer. When a rebound question is answered correctly, one point is given. If a rebound question is answered incorrectly, no points are taken away. Bonus questions are similar to rebounds, but are a bit different. Only the team that acquired the bonus question can answer it, and team members can discuss the question, and again, only the team captain can give the answer. When a bonus is answered correctly, three points are given, whereas if it is answered incorrectly, no points are taken away. Bonus questions are not cumulative, and once they are over, another toss-up is given. If no one buzzes in for a toss-up question, no one gains or loses points. It should also be noted that if rebounds are answered correctly, they do not bring with them a bonus question.
Once the 30 minutes of the match are up, the lightning round takes action. 5 final questions, only that when a rebound is answered correctly, a bonus question is also attained.

'''LON-CAPA''' (Learning Online Network with Computer-Assisted Personalized Approach) is an [[e-learning]] platform, also known as a Course Management System (CMS) or Learning Management System ([[Learning management system|LMS]]). It possesses the standard features of many learning platforms (user roles, [[calendar]], [[e-mail]], [[chat room]]s, [[blog]]s, resource construction, test grading, etc.), but it differs from traditional e-learning platforms in that its many [[web server]]s (in various parts of the world) can communicate with each other.&lt;ref name='campussource'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campussource.de/org/software/loncapa/ |title=LON-CAPA |accessdate=2007-11-30 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher=CampusSource |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the term LON-CAPA can also refer to the LON-CAPA network, i.e. the entire set of LON-CAPA web servers and the specific implementation of an internet [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] that connects these web servers.&lt;ref name='nf'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lon-capa.org/networkfeatures.html |title=Network Features |accessdate=2007-11-30 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=LON-CAPA |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; LON-CAPA can also refer to the LON-CAPA project, i.e. the core team of scientists and programmers that develop and maintain the LON-CAPA [[computer software|software]].

There are, as of 2010, more than 160 LON-CAPA domains, where a domain is a unified set of LON-CAPA web servers.&lt;ref name='nf'/&gt; LON-CAPA domains are operated, generally speaking, by individual [[university|universities]] and [[high school]]s in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], but include private organizations and a significant number of universities in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[South America]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref name='nf'/&gt; The LON-CAPA network allows participating universities and schools to create learning resources (test problems, [[web page]]s, etc.) and to share them across the network. This [[Collaboration|collaborative]] aspect is LON-CAPA's most distinctive feature.&lt;ref name='campussource'/&gt;

Another special feature of LON-CAPA is the ability to design test resources (called problems) that make use of [[random number generation|random numbers]] (stored in [[Perl]] [[Variable (programming)|variables]]). This allows a single "problem resource" to generate a variety of similar (but different) test exercises, thus significantly reducing the risk of cheating amongst students.&lt;ref name='newsforge'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/articles/54225 |title=Open source package passes personal learning test |accessdate=2007-11-30 |last=Gasperson |first=Tina |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-05-17 |format= |work= |publisher=Linux.com |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the great majority of LON-CAPA's learning resources are written in English and focus on the [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[natural science]]s, mostly significantly [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].&lt;ref name='campussource'/&gt; The learning platform works extensively with [[LaTeX]], a language used to represent [[formula]]s and mathematical expressions. The project is funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF).&lt;ref name='sloanc'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sloan-c.org/effective/details4.asp?FS_ID=45 |title=Practice: Computer-Assisted Personalized Assignments, Quizzes, and Examinations |accessdate=2007-11-30 |last=Moore |first=Janet |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2003-11-19 |format= |work= |publisher=The Sloan Consortium |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108075659/http://www.sloan-c.org/effective/details4.asp?FS_ID=45 |archivedate=2007-11-08 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LON-CAPA is [[Open-source software|open source]] and free of licensing fees.&lt;ref name='sloanc'/&gt; Significant technologies include [[Linux]], [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], [[mod perl]], [[MySQL]], [[LaTeX]] and [[CPAN]]. The core LON-CAPA development team is based at [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name='newsforge'/&gt; There are also major LON-CAPA [[Node (networking)|network nodes]] at [[Simon Fraser University]], the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], and [[Purdue University]].&lt;ref name='purdue'&gt;[http://www.itap.purdue.edu/learning/tools/loncapa/index.html ITaP LON-CAPA Information Page] 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The name LON-CAPA is an [[acronym]], derived from &lt;u&gt;L&lt;/u&gt;earning &lt;u&gt;O&lt;/u&gt;nline &lt;u&gt;N&lt;/u&gt;etwork with &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;omputer-&lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;ssisted &lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;ersonalized &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;pproach. In 1999, two distinct e-learning projects, CAPA and LectureOnline, joined efforts in the creation of LON-CAPA, which provides a superset of the CAPA and LectureOnline functionalities.&lt;ref name='newsforge'/&gt;

'''Language attrition''' is the process of losing a [[First language|native, or first, language]]. This process is generally caused by both isolation from speakers of the first language and the acquisition and use of a [[second language]], which interferes with the correct production and comprehension of the first. Such [[Language transfer|interference]] from a second language is likely experienced to some extent by all [[Multilingualism|bilinguals]], but is most evident among speakers for whom a language other than their first has started to play an important, if not dominant, role in everyday life; these speakers are at a higher risk for experiencing language attrition.&lt;ref name="let.rug.nl"&gt;[http://www.let.rug.nl/languageattrition/Papers/Schmid%20&amp;%20Kopke%202007.pdf Köpke, Barbara., Schimd, Monika (2007) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands/Laboratoire de Neuropsycholinguistique, Université de Toulouse, Le Mirail, France "Bilingualism and Attrition"]&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of this is found in immigrants, who may move to a country in which a language foreign to them is spoken, and go on to use that later-learned environmental language in their daily lives. Their gradual decline in proficiency in their first language, or L1, resulting from both isolation from other speakers of their L1 and interference from the L2 they are acquiring, is considered language attrition.

There are a number of factors which may affect the process of L1 attrition. Frequent exposure and use of a particular language is often assumed adequate to maintain the native language system intact. However, research has often failed to confirm this prediction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://babylonia.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/2008-2/schmid_01.pdf Schimd, Monika (2008) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands "Defining Language Attrition"]&lt;/ref&gt; A positive attitude towards the potentially attriting language or its speech community and motivation to retain the language are other factors which may reduce the effects of attrition. This factor too is difficult to confirm by research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.let.rug.nl/languageattrition/Papers/Schmid%20&amp;%20Dusseldorp%202010.pdf Dusseldorp, Elise., Schimd, Monika (2010) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands/TNO, Quality of Life &amp; Leiden University, The Netherlands "Quantitative analyses in a multivariate study of language attrition: The impact of extralinguistic factors"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, age of the [[wikt:attriter|attriter]] can well predict the likelihood of attrition; children are demonstrably more likely to lose their first language than adults.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2009.00521.x | volume=59 | title=Maturational Constraints and First Language Attrition | year=2009 | journal=Language Learning | pages=687–715 | last1 = Bylund | first1 = Emanuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/bookshl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YUQ9AAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=K%C3%B6pke,+B.+and+Schmid,+M.S.+2004:+First+language+attrition:+the+next+phase.+In+Schmid,+M.S.,+K%C3%B6pke,+B.,+Keijzer,+M.+and+Weilemar,+L.,+editors,+First+language+attrition:+interdisciplinary+perspectives+on+methodological++issues.+Amsterdam/Philadelphia:+John&amp;ots=qvh0yLDh5l&amp;sig=_8DMmm-r6aBAQ3xedGp7m9Ggotc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Köpke &amp; Schmid 2004] Schmid, M.

However, the overall impact of these factors is far less strongly pronounced than what has been found in second language acquisition.

Language attrition results in a decrease of language proficiency from what was previously acquired. The current consensus is that attrition manifests itself first and most noticeably in the vocabulary knowledge of speakers (in their lexical access and their mental lexicon)&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Schmid, M. S., Köpke, B., Keijzer, M., &amp; Weilemar, L. (Eds.). (2004). First language attrition: Interdisciplinary perspectives on methodological issues (Vol. 28). John Benjamins Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; while grammatical and especially phonological representations appear more stable among speakers for whom emigration took place after puberty.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid | first1 = M. S. | year = 2009 | title = On L1 attrition and the linguistic system | url = | journal = EUROSLA Yearbook | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 212–244 | doi = 10.1075/eurosla.9.11sch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==
The term ''first language attrition'' (FLA) refers to the gradual decline in native language proficiency. As speakers use their L2 frequently and become proficient (or even dominant) in it, some aspects of the L1 can deteriorate or become subject to L2 influence.

The study of language attrition became a subfield of linguistics with a 1980 conference at the University of Pennsylvania called "Loss of Language Skills".&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Richard D., Freed, Barbara F.. 1982.&amp;nbsp;''The Loss of language skills''. The University of California&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the conference was to discuss areas of second language, or L2, attrition and to ideate on possible future research. The conference revealed that attrition is a wide topic, with numerous factors and taking many forms. Decades later, the field of first language attrition gained new momentum with two conferences held in Amsterdam in 2002 and 2005, as well as a series of graduate workshops and panels at international conferences, such as the International Symposium on Bilingualism (2007, 2009), the annual conferences of the European Second Language Association, and the AILA World Congress (2008). The outcomes of some of these meetings were later published in edited volumes.&lt;ref name="Shmid, Monika 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shmid | first1 = Monika | year = 2004 | title = First language attrition: The methodology revised | url = | journal = International Journal of Bilingualism | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 239–255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="let.rug.nl"/&gt;

To study the process of language attrition, researchers initially looked at neighboring areas of linguistics to identify which parts of the L1 system attrite first; lacking years of experimental data of attrition itself, linguists studied [[language contact]], [[Creole genesis|creolization]], [[Second-language acquisition|L2 acquisition]], and [[aphasia]], and applied their findings to language acquisition.&lt;ref name="Shmid, Monika 2004"/&gt;

One issue that is faced when researching attrition is distinguishing between normal L2 influence on the L1 and actual attrition of the L1. Since all bilinguals experience some degree of [[Crosslinguistic influence|cross linguistic influence]], where the L2 interferes with the retrieval of the speaker's L1, it is difficult to determine if delays and/or mistakes in the L1 are due to attrition or cause by CLI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larsen-Freeman | first1 = D. | last2 = Schmid | first2 = M. S. | last3 = Lowie | first3 = W. | year = 2011 | title = Introduction: From structure to chaos.&amp;nbsp; | url = | journal = Modeling Bilingualism Studies in Bilingualism | volume =  | issue = | pages =  1–12| doi = 10.1075/sibil.43.02intro }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, simultaneous bilinguals may not have a language that is indistinguishable from that of a native speaker or a language where their knowledge of it is less extensive than a native speaker's; therefore testing for attrition is difficult.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

==Manifestations==
===Lexical attrition===

The first linguistic system to be affected by first language attrition is the lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Köpke | first1 = B. | last2 = Schimd | first2 = M. S. | last3 = Keijzer | first3 = M. C. | last4 = Dostert | first4 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Language attrition: theoretical perspectives | url = | journal = Studies in Bilingualism | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1075/sibil.33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lexical-semantic relationship usually starts to deteriorate first and most quickly, driven by Cross Linguistic Interference (CLI) from the attriter's L2, and it is believed to be exacerbated by continued exposure to, and frequent use of, the L2.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. S. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Jarvis | first2 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Lexical access and lexical diversity in first language attrition | url = | journal = Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = 04| pages = 729–748 | doi = 10.1017/s1366728913000771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for such interlanguage effects can be seen in a study by Pavlenko (2003, 2004) which shows that there was some semantic extension from the L2, which was English, into the L1 Russian speakers' lexicons. In order to test for lexical attrition, researchers use tests such as picture naming tasks, where they place a picture of an item in front of the participant and ask them to name it, or by measuring lexical diversity in the speaker's spontaneous speech (speech that is unprompted and improvised). In both cases, attriters performed worse than non-attriters.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Ammerlaan, T. (1996). "You get a bit wobbly...": exploring bilingual lexical retrieval processes in the context of first language attrition. Nijmegen, Netherlands: S.n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Hulsen, M. (2000). Language loss and language processing: three generations of Dutch migrants in New Zealand. S.l.: S.n&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Montrul | first1 = S. A. | year = 2009 | title = Incomplete acquisition in bilingualism: re-examining the age factor | url = | journal = Studies in Bilingualism| volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1075/sibil.39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid | first1 = M. S. | year = 2002 | title = First Language Attrition, Use and Maintenance | url = | journal = Studies in Bilingualism | volume = 24 | issue = | page = 258 | doi = 10.1075/sibil.24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothesis suggests that when a speaker tries to access a lexical item from their L1 they are also competing with the translation equivalents of their L2 and that there is either a problem with activating the L1 due to infrequent use or with the inhibition of the competing L2.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. S. 2014"/&gt;

===Grammatical attrition===

Grammatical attrition can be defined as "the disintegration of the structure of a first language (L1) in contact situations with a second language (L2)".&lt;ref&gt;Seliger, H. W., &amp; Vago, R. M. (1991). First language attrition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of bilingual Swedes raised outside of Sweden, who in their late twenties returned to their home country for schooling, there was noted to be attrition of their L1. The participants demonstrated a complete retention of the underlying syntactic structure of their L1. Notably, they exhibited the V2, verb second, word order present in most Germanic languages, except English. This rule requires the tense-marked verb of a main clause to occur in the second position of the sentence, even if that means it comes before the subject (e.g. there is an adverb at the beginning of the sentence). These speakers' ability to form sentences with V2 word order was compared against L2 learners who often overproduce the rigid SVO word order rather than applying the V2 rule. Although the study did not show evidence for attrition of syntax of the person's L1, there was evidence for attrition in the expatriates' morphology, especially in terms of agreement. They found that the bilinguals would choose to use the unmarked morphemes in place of the marked one when having to differentiate between gender and plurality; also they tend to overgeneralize where certain morphemes can be used. For example, they may use the suffix /-a/, which is used to express an indefinite plural, and overextend this morpheme to also represent the indefinite singular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Håkansson | first1 = G | year = 1995 | title = Syntax and morphology in language attrition: a study of five bilingual expatriate Swedes | url = | journal = International Journal of Applied Linguistics | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 153–169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1473-4192.1995.tb00078.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence to support the view that there is a complete restructuring of the language systems. That is, even under language attrition the syntax is largely unaffected and any variability observed is thought to be due to interference from another language, rather than attrition.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Tsimpli, I., Sorace, A., Heycock, C., &amp; Filiaci, F. (2004). First language attrition and syntactic subjects: a study of Greek and Italian near-native speakers of English" ''International Journal of Bilingualism'' 8(3), 257-277. Retrieved from http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~antonell/TsimpliSoraceHeycockFiliaci2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsimpli | first1 = I. M. | year = 2007 | title = First language attrition from a minimalist perspective: Interface vulnerability and processing effects | url = | journal = Studies in Bilingualism Language Attrition | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 83–98 | doi = 10.1075/sibil.33.07tsi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

L1 attriters, like L2 learners, may use language differently from native speakers. In particular, they can have variability on certain rules which native speakers apply deterministically.&lt;ref&gt;Sorace, A. 2005. "Selective optionality in language development". In: Cornips, L. &amp; Corrigan, K. P., (eds.),&amp;nbsp;''Syntax and Variation: reconciling the biological and the social'', pp.&amp;nbsp;55–80 Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In the context of attrition, however, there is strong evidence that this optionality is not indicative of any underlying representational deficits: the same individuals do not appear to encounter recurring problems with the same kinds of grammatical phenomena in different speech situations or on different tasks.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This suggests that problems of L1 attriters are due to momentary conflicts between the two linguistic systems and not indicative of a structural change to underlying linguistic knowledge (that is, to an emerging representational deficit of any kind). This assumption is in line with a range of investigations of L1 attrition which argue that this process may affect interface phenomena (e.g. the distribution of overt and null subjects in pro-drop languages) but will not touch the narrow syntax.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montrul, S. 2004. "Convergent outcomes in L2 acquisition and L1 loss". In: Schmid, M. S., Köpke, B., Keijzer, M. &amp; Weilemar, L. (eds.),&amp;nbsp;''First Language Attrition: interdisciplinary perspectives on methodological issues''&amp;nbsp;(pp.&amp;nbsp;259–279). Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montrul, S. 2008.&amp;nbsp;''Incomplete Acquisition in Bilingualism: re-examining the age factor''. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonological attrition===

Phonological attrition is a form of language loss that affects the speaker's ability to produce their native language with their native accent. A study of five native speakers of American English who moved to Brazil and learned Portuguese as their L2 demonstrates the possibility that one could lose one's L1 accent in place of an accent that is directly influenced by the L2.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} It is thought that phonological loss can occur to those who are closer to native-like fluency in the L2, especially in terms of phonological production, and for those who have immersed themselves and built a connection to the culture of the country for the L2.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} A sociolinguistic approach to this phenomenon is that the acquisition of a native-like L2 accent and the subsequent loss of one's native accent is influenced by the societal norms of the country and the speakers' attempt to adapt in order to feel a part of the culture they are trying to assimilate into.&lt;ref&gt;Major, R. (1994). Sociolinguistic factors in loss and acquisition of phonology. In K. Hyltenstam &amp; A. Viberg (Eds.), Progression and Regression in Language: Sociocultural, Neuropsychological and Linguistic Perspectives (pp. 463-478). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{DOI|10.1017/CBO9780511627781.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of attrition is not to be confused with contact-induced change since that would mean speech production changes due to an increased use of another language and not due to the less frequent use of the L1.&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, C., &amp; Lin, Y. (2015). Tonal Change Induced by Language Attrition and Phonetic Similarity in Hai-lu Hakka. Prosody and Language in Contact Prosody, Phonology and Phonetics, 189-220. {{DOI|10.1007/978-3-662-45168-7_10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies and hypotheses==
Lambert and Moore&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, R. D. &amp; Moore, S. J. (1986). "Problem Areas in the Study of Language Attrition". In: Weltens, B., de Bot, K. &amp; van Els, T. (eds.),&amp;nbsp;''Language Attrition in Progress, Studies on Language Acquisition''&amp;nbsp;(p.&amp;nbsp;177 – p.&amp;nbsp;186). Dordrecht, NL: Foris Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to define numerous hypotheses regarding the nature of language loss, crossed with various aspects of language. They envisioned a test to be given to American [[State Department]] employees that would include four linguistic categories ([[syntax]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[lexicon]], and [[phonology]]) and three skill areas ([[reading (activity)|reading]], [[listening]], and [[Speech communication|speaking]]). A translation component would feature on a sub-section of each skill area tested. The test was to include linguistic features that are the most difficult, according to teachers, for students to master. Such a test may confound testing what was not acquired with what was lost. Lambert, in personal communication with Köpke and Schmid,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; described the results as 'not substantial enough to help much in the development of the new field of language skill attrition'.

The use of translation tests to study language loss is inappropriate for a number of reasons: it is questionable what such tests measure; too much [[Variation (linguistics)|variation]]; the difference between attriters and [[multilingualism|bilinguals]] is complex; activating two languages at once may cause interference. Yoshitomi&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Yoshitomi, A. (1992). "Towards a Model of Language Attrition: neurological and psychological contributions". In:&amp;nbsp;''Issues in Applied Linguistics''; Vol 3, No 2: 293-318.&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to define a model of language attrition that was related to [[neurological]] and [[psychological]] aspects of language learning and unlearning. She discussed four possible hypotheses and five key aspects related to acquisition and attrition. The hypotheses are:
* 1. Reverse order: last learned, first forgotten. Studies by Russell&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Robert (1999). "Lexical maintenance and attrition in Japanese as a second language". In: Hansen, Lynne (ed.).''Second Language Attrition: evidence from Japanese contexts''&amp;nbsp;(p.&amp;nbsp;114 – p.&amp;nbsp;141). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hayashi&lt;ref&gt;Hayashi, Brenda (1999). "Testing the regression hypotheis: the remains of the Japanese negation system in Micronesia". In: Hansen, Lynne (ed.).&amp;nbsp;''Second Language Attrition: evidence from Japanese contexts''&amp;nbsp;(p.&amp;nbsp;154 – p.&amp;nbsp;168). Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; both looked at the Japanese negation system and both found that attrition was the reverse order of acquisition. Yoshitomi and others, including Yukawa,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Yukawa, E. (1998).&amp;nbsp;''L1 Japanese Attrition and Regaining: three case studies of two early bilingual children''. Tokyo: Kurosio Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; argue that attrition can occur so rapidly, it is impossible to determine the order of loss.
* 2. Inverse relation: better learned, better retained. Language items that are acquired first also happen to be those that are most reinforced. As a result, hypotheses 1 and 2 ''capture the main linguistic characteristics of language attrition''&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* 3. Critical period: at or around age 9. As a child grows, he becomes less able to master native-like abilities. Furthermore, various linguistic features (for example phonology or syntax) may have different stages or age limits for mastering.

Furthermore, they discuss a number of cases where a native-like L2 was acquired during adulthood.

According to Yoshitomi,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; the five key aspects related to attrition are [[neuroplasticity]], consolidation, [[permastore]]/savings, decreased accessibility, and receptive versus productive abilities.

=== The regression hypothesis ===
The regression hypothesis, first formulated by Roman Jakobson in 1941 and originally formulated on the phonology of only Slavic languages,&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=7i8ZLfGKcjcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=de+Bot,+K.+%26+B.+Weltens+(1991).+Recapitulation,+regression,+and+language+loss.+In+SELIGER+%26+VAGO+(eds),+31-51.&amp;ots=vX7Qy11wyl&amp;sig=Oe1D7OsTmyLCi7QLBl-cesHMuLE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false De Bot (1991)] De Bot, K., &amp; Weltens, B. (1991). Recapitulation, regression, and language loss. First language attrition, 31-51.&lt;/ref&gt; goes back to the beginnings of psychology and psychoanalysis. It states that that which was learned first will be retained last, both in 'normal' processes of forgetting and in pathological conditions such as aphasia or dementia.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; As a template for language attrition, the regression hypothesis has long seemed an attractive paradigm. However, regression is not in itself a theoretical or explanatory framework.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keijzer | first1 = M | year = 2007 | title = Last in first out?: An investigation of the regression hypothesis in Dutch emigrants in Anglophone Canada | url = | journal = Toegepaste Taalwetenschap in Artikelen | volume = 78 | issue = 1| pages = 131–139 | doi=10.1075/ttwia.78.12kei}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both order of acquisition and order of attrition need to be put into the larger context of linguistic theory in order to gain explanatory adequacy.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keijzer | first1 = M | year = 2010 | title = The regression hypothesis as a framework for first language attrition | url = | journal = Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 9–18 | doi=10.1017/s1366728909990356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keijzer (2007) conducted a study on the attrition of Dutch in Anglophone Canada. She finds some evidence that later-learned rules, such as diminutive and plural formation, indeed erode before earlier learned grammatical rules.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; However, there is also considerable interaction between the first and second language and so a straightforward 'regression pattern' cannot be observed.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Also, parallels in noun and verb phrase morphology could be present because of the nature of the tests or because of avoidance by the participants.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; In a follow up 2010 article, Keijzer suggests that the regression hypothesis may be more applicable to morphology than to syntax.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Citing the studies on the regression hypothesis that have been done, Yukawa&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; says that the results have been contradictory. It is possible that attrition is a case-by-case situation depending on a number of variables (age, proficiency,&amp; [[literacy]], the similarities between the L1 and L2, and whether the L1 or the L2 is attriting). The [[threshold hypothesis]] states that there may be a level of proficiency that once attained, enables the attriting language to remain stable.

== Factors ==

===Age effect===
Children are more susceptible to (first) language attrition than adults.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Research shows an age effect around the ages of 8 through 13.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before this time period, a first language can attrite under certain circumstances, the most prominent being a sudden decline in exposure to the first language. Various case studies show that children who emigrate before puberty and have little to no exposure to their first language end up losing the first language. In 2009, a study compared two groups of Swedish-speaking groups: native Swedish speakers and Korean international adoptees who were at risk for losing their Korean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyltenstam | first1 = K. | last2 = Bylund | first2 = E. | last3 = Abrahamsson | first3 = N. | last4 = Park | first4 = H. S. | year = 2009 | title = Dominant-language replacement: The case of international adoptees | url = | journal = Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 121–140 | doi=10.1017/s1366728908004008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Korean adoptees, those who were adopted the earliest essentially lost their Korean and those adopted later still retained some of it, although it was primarily their comprehension of Korean that was spared.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A 2007 study looked at Korean adoptees in France and found that they performed on par with native French speakers in French proficiency and Korean.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1615/ab35ebe2c40dfbb5463b3e1a66b67a6c3563.pdf Pallier 2007] Pallier, C. (2007). Critical periods in language acquisition and language attrition. Language attrition: Theoretical perspectives, 155-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attrition of a first language does not guarantee an advantage in learning a second language.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Attriters are outperformed by native speakers of the second language in proficiency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A 2009 study tested the Swedish proficiency of Swedish speakers who had attrited knowledge of Spanish. These participants did show almost but not quite native-like proficiency when compared to native Swedish speakers, and they did not show an advantage when compared with bilingual Swedish-Spanish speakers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

On the other hand, L1 attrition may also occur if the overall effort to maintain the first language is insufficient while exposed to a dominant L2 environment. Another recent investigation, focussing on the development of language in late bilinguals (i.e. adults past puberty), has claimed that maintenance of the mother tongue in an L1 environment requires little to no maintenance for individuals, whereas those in the L2 environment have an additive requirement for the maintenance of the L1 and the development of the L2 (Optiz, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Opitz|first=Conny|date=2013-12-01|title=A dynamic perspective on late bilinguals' linguistic development in an L2 environment|url=http://ijb.sagepub.com/content/17/6/701|journal=International Journal of Bilingualism|language=en|volume=17|issue=6|pages=701–715|doi=10.1177/1367006912454621|issn=1367-0069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

there have been cases in which adults have undergone first language attrition. A 2011 study tested adult monolingual English speakers, adult monolingual Russian speakers and adult bilingual English-Russian speakers on naming various liquid containers (cup, glass, mug, etc.) in both English and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlenko|first=Aneta|last2=Malt|first2=Barbara C.|date=2011|title=Kitchen Russian: Cross-linguistic differences and first-language object naming by Russian-English bilinguals|url=|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|volume=14|pages=19–45|doi=10.1017/s136672891000026x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed that the bilinguals had attrited Russian vocabulary because they did not label these liquid containers the same way as the monolingual Russian speakers. When grouped according to Age of Acquisition (AoA) of English, the bilinguals showed an effect of AoA (or perhaps length of exposure to the L2) in that bilinguals with earlier AoA (mean AoA 3.4 years) exhibited much stronger attrition than bilinguals with later AoA (mean AoA 22.8 years). That is, the individuals with earlier AoA were the more different from monolingual Russian speakers in their labeling and categorization of drinking vessels, than the people with later AoA. However, even the late AoA bilinguals exhibited some degree of attrition in that they labeled the drinking vessels differently from native monolingual Russian-speaking adults.

==== Critical period hypothesis ====
Given that exposure to an L2 at a younger age typically leads to stronger attrition of the L1 than L2 exposure at later ages, there may be a relationship between language attrition and the [[critical period hypothesis]]. The critical period for language claims that there is an optimal time period for humans to acquire language, and after this time language acquisition is more difficult (though not impossible). Language attrition also seems to have a time period; before around age 12, a first language is most susceptible to attrition if there is reduced exposure to that language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research shows that the complete attrition of a language would occur before the critical period ends.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

All available evidence on the age effect for L1 attrition therefore indicates that the development of susceptibility displays a curved, not a linear, function. This suggests that in native language learning there is indeed a Critical Period effect, and that full development of native language capacities necessitates exposure to L1 input for the entire duration of this CP.

====L2 attrition====

In Hansen &amp; Reetz-Kurashige (1999), Hansen cites her own research on L2-Hindi and Urdu attrition in young children. As young pre-school children in India and Pakistan, the subjects of her study were often judged to be native speakers of Hindi or Urdu; their mother was far less proficient. On return visits to their home country, the United States, both children appeared to lose all their L2 while the mother noticed no decline in her own L2 abilities. Twenty years later, those same young children as adults ''comprehend not a word from recordings of their own animated conversations in Hindi-Urdu; the mother still understands much of them''.

Yamamoto (2001) found a link between age and bilinguality. In fact, a number of factors are at play in bilingual families. In her study, bicultural families that maintained only one language, the minority language, in the household, were able to raise bilingual, bicultural children without fail. Families that adopted the one parent – one language policy were able to raise bilingual children at first but when the children joined the dominant language school system, there was a 50% chance that children would lose their minority language abilities. In families that had more than one child, the older child was most likely to retain two languages, if it was at all possible. Younger siblings in families with more than two other brothers and sisters had little chance of maintaining or ever becoming bilingual.

=== Age of arrival ===
There are few principled and systematic investigations of FLA specifically investigating the impact of AoA. However, converging evidence suggests an age effect on FLA which is much stronger and more clearly delineated than the effects that have been found in SLA research. Two studies that consider prepuberty and postpuberty migrants (Ammerlaan, 1996, AoA 0–29 yrs; Pelc, 2001, AoA 8–32 years) find that AoA is one of the most important predictors of ultimate proficiency, and a number of studies that investigate the impact of age among postpuberty migrants fail to find any effect at all (Köpke, 1999, AoA 14–36 yrs; Schmid, 2002, AoA 12–29 yrs; Schmid, 2007, AoA 17–51 yrs). A range of studies conducted by Montrul on Spanish heritage speakers in the US as well as Spanish-English bilinguals with varying levels of AoA also suggests that the L1 system of early bilinguals may be similar to that of L2 speakers, while later learners pattern with monolinguals in their L1 (e.g. Montrul, 2008; Montrul, 2009). These findings therefore indicate strongly that early (prepuberty) and late (postpuberty) exposure to an L2 environment have a different impact on possible fossilization and/or deterioration of the linguistic system.

===Frequency of use===
Frequency of use has been shown to be an important factor in language attrition.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prosody and Language in Contact: L2 Acquisition, Attrition and Languages in Multilingual Situations|last=Yeh|first=Chia-Hsin|last2=Lin|first2=Yen-Hwei|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=London|pages=194|chapter=Chapter 10: Tonal Change Induced by Language Attrition and Phonetic Similarity in Hai-lu Hakka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decline in use of a given language leads to gradual loss of that language.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book|title=First language attrition|last=Seliger|first=Herbert L.|last2=Vago|first2=Robert M.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Interfaces: Second language acquisition and first language attrition of Spanish subject realization and word order variation|last=Domínguez|first=Laura|publisher=John Benjamins|year=2013|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of much evidence to the contrary, one study is often cited to suggest that frequency of use does not correlate strongly with language attrition.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254809520_Social_Determinants_of_Language_Loss|title=Social Determinants of Language Loss|last=Jaspaert|first=Koen|last2=Kroon|first2=S.|date=January 1989|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their methodology, however, can be called into question, especially concerning the small sample size and the reliance on self reported data.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=First Language Attrition: Interdisciplinary perspectives on methodological issues|last=Köpke|first=Barbara|last2=Schmid|first2=Monika S.|publisher=John Benjamins|year=2004|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers themselves state that their findings may be inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The overall evidence suggests that frequency of use is a strong indicator of language attrition.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

===Motivation===
Motivation could be defined as the willingness and desire to learn a second language, or, in the case of attrition, the incentive to maintain a language.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction|last=Archibald|first=John|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=1997|isbn=|location=New York|pages=496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation can be split into four categories,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.academypublication.com/issues/past/tpls/vol01/06/12.pdf|title=The Interrelationship of Instrumental, Integrative, Intrinsic, and Extrinsic Motivations and the Lexical-oriented Knowledge among Persian EFL Language Learners|last=Soureshjani|first=Kamal Heidari|last2=Naseri|first2=Noushin|date=June 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is often simply split into two distinct forms: the instrumental and the integrative.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Instrumental motivation, in the case of attrition, is the desire to maintain a language in order to complete a specific goal, i.e. maintaining a language to maintain a job. Integrative motivation, however, is motivation that comes from a desire to fit in or maintain one's cultural ties.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; These inferences can be drawn, as strategies for knowledge maintenance will, by definition, precisely oppose actions that lead to forgetting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227983368_The_Handbook_of_Applied_Linguistics|title=Language attrition|last=Schmid|first=Monika S.|last2=de Bot|first2=Kees|date=2003|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are differences in attrition related to motivation depending on the type at hand. Instrumental motivation is often less potent than integrative motivation, but, given sufficient incentives, it can be equally as powerful.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; A 1972 study by Gardner and Lambert emphasized the importance of integrative motivation in particular in regards to factors relating to language acquisition, and, by extension, language attrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281000889X|title=Attitude, motivation, and difficulties involved in learning the English language and factors that affect motivation in learning it|last=Al Rifai|first=Nada|date=2010|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.03.849|volume=2|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|pages=5216–5227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3178">'''Learning Resource Centre (LRC)''' is a term which is used in the [[United Kingdom]] to describe a type of [[library]] that exists within an educational setting such as [[Secondary School]]s, [[Further Education]] [[College]]s and Universities. LRC can also stand for Library Resource Centre and in some cases Learning Resource Centre has been shortened to Learning Centre.  Learning Resource Centres are similar to a [[Hybrid library]].

[[File:Liverpool John Moores University Aldham Roberts Library 2.JPG|thumbnail|125px|[[Aldham Robarts LRC|Liverpool John Moores University Aldham Robarts LRC]]]]

==Overview==
These centres contain traditional educational resources such as books, journals, software and audio/visual materials, but they also exist to promote electronic information resources. Examples of these are subscription electronic journals, databases, free websites and other web based resources. The traditional [[Librarian]] role has been replaced with the LRC Manager who is an [[Information Professional]] with qualifications recognised by [[CILIP]]. As well as managing the physical environment of the LRC the LRC Manager is usually involved in editing LRC web pages and making contributions to the [[Virtual Learning Environment]], in order to provide access to quality and timely resources to colleagues and students.  A key aspect of a Learning Resource centre is the application of self study in a variety of different ways.  They usually include computers, places to study and often private rooms.

LRCs usually have a responsibility for the teaching of [[Information Literacy]] and/or Study Skills within the institution they are in. Although this role is firmly established in further and higher education, it has only become a serious responsibility for the Secondary School LRC since the publication of [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225848/http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/studysupport/impact/ks3/ Key Stage 3 National Strategy] in 2003. The schools inspectorate [[Office for Standards in Education|OfSTED]] have also made this a key area for school LRCs to evaluate themselves on in their self-evaluation document for LRCs in 2003.

'''''Light It Up''''' is a 1999 [[United States|American]] [[hostage]] [[crime]] [[teen film|teen]] [[drama film]] starring an [[ensemble cast]] that consists of [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] singer/actor [[Usher Raymond]] (in his first leading role), [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Forest Whitaker]], and [[Vanessa Williams|Vanessa L. Williams]]. The film was written and directed by [[Craig Bolotin]], and produced by [[Kenneth Edmonds|Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]] and his wife [[Tracy Edmonds]].

The film follows six teenage high school seniors who hold a wounded police officer hostage and barricade themselves inside the school.

==Plot summary==
{{plot|date=October 2015}}
In an urban [[Queens]] high school students, Lester DeWitt ([[Usher Raymond]]), Julius Zacharias 'Ziggy' Malone ([[Robert Ri'chard]]), who lost his father, hard-working student Stephanie Williams ([[Rosario Dawson]]), [[criminal]] Rodney J. Templeton ([[Fredro Starr]]), rebellious pregnant Lynn Sabatini ([[Sara Gilbert]]), and Robert Tremont a.k.a. "Rivers" ([[Clifton Collins, Jr.]]), attend the history class of Ken Knowles ([[Judd Nelson]]). Police officer Dante Jackson ([[Forest Whitaker]]) tries to arrest Lester after a misunderstanding when the classroom's windows are broken by rocks, Mr. Knowles takes them to the [[Principal (school)|principal]]'s office, where Principal Allen Armstrong ([[Glynn Turman]]) tells Knowles to take them "anywhere".

Since there is no space anywhere in the school, Knowles and the kids go to a local diner, where a [[robbery]] takes place. Knowles confronts the robber, who was a former student that dropped out of school. Principal Armstrong is infuriated by what Knowles has done, and puts him on administrative leave. Lester, Stephanie and Ziggy are at the main office as Knowles leaves the school. Stephanie is disgusted that Principal Armstrong has ignored that he told Knowles to "take the class anywhere" and confronts him about this. In response Principal Armstrong suspends Rivers, Ziggy, Stephanie and Lester from the school and calls in Officer Jackson to remove all of them. Ziggy decides to leave but Officer Jackson restrains him. This event is witnessed by other students at the school and soon everything turns into a small riot.

Lester tries to resist Officer Jackson and loses, but Ziggy picks up Officer Jackson's dropped [[Glock pistol|Glock 19]] pistol and says "I [Ziggy] cannot go home." The reason for this, is because Ziggy has been physically abused by his father for many years. Officer Jackson tries to restrain Ziggy but gets accidentally shot in the leg as he grabs for his gun. Principal Armstrong tells school security to call an [[ambulance]] and the [[New York City Police Department|N.Y.P.D.]] in order to arrest Ziggy. Lester then grabs the gun and orders everyone to evacuate the school. This finally forces the N.Y.P.D. detectives to come in, led by Detective Audrey McDonald ([[Vanessa Williams|Vanessa L. Williams]]) as a negotiator.

In the middle of all of this, there is a subplot in which Lynn berates Stephanie for being a "goody-two shoes", and a fight in the school's library that includes Rivers and Rodney, as well as Officer Jackson fleeing from Rodney and the others after knocking him out to use the bathroom. Another notable subplot was Ziggy showing everyone his artistic talents, such being a mural of himself and others on a classroom wall.

Still waiting after a couple of hours, the group continues to hold Officer Dante Jackson against his will. Lester tells everybody, including Stephanie and Dante about how his father ([[Robert Lee Minor]]) who was gunned down during a wrongful arrest. In the next few scenes, Rivers, Lynn, Rodney, Ziggy, Stephanie, and Lester, a.k.a. "The Lincoln 6", are all becoming infamous across [[New York City]], as they are exposed and identified on such networks such as [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], [[VH1]], [[NBC]], [[NY1]] and [[CBS]], as well as [[MTV]], as well being announced on radio. Debate continues as the events taking place, until Detective McDonald and her colleague (Vic Polizos) debate on getting the kids something, which after several hours of stalling, the electricity being shut down at the school and the SWAT team storming in on the others as Lester takes Officer Jackson on top of the roof. There, Lester tells Officer Jackson that he resents all policemen for what has happened to his father, and Jackson tries to reassure him. The confrontation goes horribly wrong when Ziggy comes to the roof and is shot down and killed by a sniper from a hovering police helicopter. In the end, 5 of the remaining surviving teens are taken into custody shortly after Ziggy is pronounced dead.

As the film reaches its climax, the narrator talks about what happened to the kids and the officer: Officer Jackson testified in court that the events did not happen as the media have portrayed them, thus giving the kids a less sentence. Lester spent two years in state prison and has gone off to a [[municipal college|city college]] to study law. Stephanie spent one year in prison and went to study at [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's University]], Lynn was sentenced to one year in prison, but was released earlier due to having her baby boy (named after Ziggy) and is never heard from again. Rodney spends an unknown amount of time in prison and becomes a [[Muslim]], Rivers is forced to join the [[United States armed forces|military]], due to the judge having him spend years in prison due to his priors or join the army. Mr. Knowles has been rehired back to the school and still teaches history. The end also shows Lester and Stephanie looking a painting that was crafted by Ziggy, who is forever remembered as the next [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] a.k.a. "The Radiant Child".

In [[higher education]] a '''microdegree''' also '''micro degree''' and '''[[MicroMasters|micromasters]]''' is a credential focused upon a specified professional or career discipline and typically comprises one or more sources of accelerated educational experiences. Microdegrees are a single manifestation of [[Competency-based learning|Competency Based Education]] (CBE) which seeks to tie credentialing to specific skills sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edcircuit.com/moocs-and-credentialing-a-revolutionary-perspective/ |title=MOOCs and Credentialing: A Revolutionary Perspective |publisher=EdCircuit.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microcredentials including Microdegrees act as a [[Pointer (user interface)|pointer]] to the criteria for and demonstration of the [[skill]]s represented by the microcredential. Because the [[credential]]s are presented in a [[Digital data|digital format]], they can be [[Parsing|parsed]] automatically for [[Verification and validation|verification]] over the web and allow for a greater level of [[granularity]] than a traditional paper [[transcript (education)|transcript]]. Microdegrees meet the criteria for Open Educational Data defined by the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DOE |first=U.S. |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/data/index.html |title=Open Data |publisher=ed.goc |date=2015-04-09 |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[hierarchy]] of educational credentials microdegrees are considered to be "[[Academic certificate|certificate]]s" requiring a lower level of commitment and rigor than a traditional [[Academic degree|degree program]] but serving an important role as a [[vocation]]al credential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fain |first=Paul |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/06/06/certificates-are-misunderstood-credentials-pay-mostly-men |title=Certificates are misunderstood credentials that pay off - mostly for men |publisher=InsideHigherEd.com |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leonhardt |first=David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/upshot/true-reform-in-higher-education-when-online-degrees-are-seen-as-official.html |title=Here’s What Will Truly Change Higher Education: Online Degrees That Are Seen as Official |publisher=New York Times |date=2015-03-05 |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[advent]] of the microdegree is presented by its promoters as a challenge to the existing degree model as it permits students to utilize accelerated, free and low cost programs to earn credentials of direct relevance to their interests and career ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/news/baton-rouge/index.ssf/2015/02/traditional_college_degrees_co.html |title=Traditional college degrees could face 'serious competition' as online 'microdegrees' emerge, website reports |publisher=NOLA.com |date=2015-02-24 |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/techtank/posts/2015/02/23-mooc-google-coursera-butler |title=How Google and Coursera may upend the traditional college degree &amp;#124; Brookings Institution |publisher=Brookings.edu |date=2015-02-23 |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/meet-the-new-self-appointed-mooc-accreditors-google-and-instagram/55807 |title=Meet the New, Self-Appointed MOOC Accreditors: Google and Instagram – Wired Campus - Blogs - The Chronicle of Higher Education |publisher=Chronicle.com |date=2015-02-11 |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etcjournal.com/2015/02/24/mooc-sightings-003-future-learn-microdegrees-open-internet/ |title=MOOC Sightings 003: FutureLearn, Microdegrees, ‘Open Internet’ &amp;#124; Educational Technology and Change Journal |publisher=Etcjournal.com |date=2015-02-25 |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-02-02-how-to-make-micro-credentials-matter |title=How to Make Micro Credentials Matter &amp;#124; EdSurge News |publisher=Edsurge.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microdegrees and other Microcredentials are also seen as a system to facilitate and record lifelong learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/micro-credentials-empowering-lifelong-learners-krista-moroder |title=Micro-Credentials: Empowering Lifelong Learners |publisher=Edutopia.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant percentage of Microdegree students are working adults seeking career change or advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/PhD-or-Microdegree-/228153/ |title=PhD or Microdegree? |last=Young |first=Jeffrey R. |publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=March 9, 2015 |accessdate=2015-03-09 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some institutions that offer Microdegree programs describe themselves as a "Micro College".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hastac.org/blogs/bill-brantley/2014/01/12/micro-colleges-and-pop-university |title=Micro-Colleges and the Pop-Up University |publisher=Hastac.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuristspeaker.com/2013/09/trimming-the-fat-introducing-the-lean-micro-college-model-for-education/ |title=Trimming the Fat – Introducing the Lean Micro-College Model |publisher=http://www.futuristspeaker.com/ |date= |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovationews.com/DaVinci-Coders-given-Microdegree-granting-authority-for-its-software-coding-courses/ |title=DaVinci Coders given Microdegree-granting authority for its software coding courses |publisher=Innovationnews.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[Massive open online course|MOOC]] platforms have started expanding their offerings of microcredentials as viable substitutes, going as far as offering a blended education model. Such programs allow graduates of the respective microcredential programs to have a reduced residency period at traditional universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamgordon/2018/02/13/voice-of-employers-rings-out-as-moocs-go-from-education-to-qualification/#3a218197564b|title='MicroMasters' Surge As MOOCs Go From Education To Qualification|last=Gordon|first=Adam|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universities like [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] have started admitting its first batch of students in [[supply chain management]] at a reduced 5-month residency period through their [[blended learning]] initiatives on the [[edX]] platform with the launch of its [[MicroMasters|Micromasters]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://campustechnology.com/articles/2018/02/06/mit-micromasters-begins-on-campus-phase.aspx|title=MIT MicroMasters Begins On-Campus Phase -- Campus Technology|website=Campus Technology|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NASA_ISSET_experiment.png|thumb|right|An ISSET-made experiment module inside the International Space Station]]
'''Mission Discovery''' is an international education program run for teenagers in many countries around the world. The programme started in 2012 in [[King's College London]], England, and has since expanded to Australia, the US and India.

Mission discovery is run and directed by ISSET (''International Space School Education Trust''), a registered UK charity founded in 1998 by Chris Barber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISSET - About Us|url=http://isset.org/index.php#about-us|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
So far there have been 15 successful programs: one in India, twelve in the UK and two in the US. Each program has given the students the chance to work with space scientists while they work as a team designing experiments. As part of this program, at least one experiment designed by the students is sent to, and carried out on, the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jamieson|first1=Steph|title=Renfrewshire pupils take part in NASA-inspired scheme|url=http://www.the-gazette.co.uk/news/14413808.Renfrewshire_school_experiment_to_be_launched_into_space/|website=The Gazette|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Discovery 2014|url=http://www.paisley.org.uk/2014/12/mission-discovery-2014/|website=Paisley.org.uk|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Mission Discovery is a week-long event in which the pupils are split into random groups to design an experiment that could be launched into space. During this week the teams are involved in exercises designed to develop their leadership, team building, and personal development skills, while also giving them an insight into scientific fields with a relation to space. The pupils will also hear talks from various [[astronauts]], scientists and people from fields outside of science, covering topics including biomedical and scientific research done by [[NASA]], and the astronaut's experiences in space, as well as topics like public speaking and how to suitably present information. Towards the end of the week, the program is more focused on the design of the students' experiments. The students are given time to design an experiment they believe could work in space and are then tasked with presenting it in both, an informative and interesting way. On the final day, the pupils present their ideas to other colleagues and mentors as well as different scientists, doctors, and professors from universities. The winning idea has their experiment designed and sent to the International Space Station where astronauts there will carry out experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King's College London Mission Discovery 2014|url=http://isset.org/mission_discovery/Downloads/King's%20College%20Mission%20Discovery%202014.pdf|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Discovery Renfrewshire|url=http://www.uws.ac.uk/current-students/careers-and-employability/mission-discovery-renfrewshire/|website=University of the West of Scotland|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scots students to see science experiment launched into space|url=http://www.scotsman.com/regions/glasgow-strathclyde/scots-students-to-see-science-experiment-launched-into-space-1-4095059|website=The Scotsman|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kids, you can define the space station's next mission|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/Kids-you-can-define-the-space-stations-next-mission/articleshow/54744920.cms|website=The Times of India|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So far there have been twenty different winning experiments. Each is then further designed with help from researchers and scientists. After a lengthy process of designing the experiment, the winning team is invited to watch the rocket launch carrying their experiment to the International Space Station. These experiments are then carried out by the current astronauts on board the ISS. Depending on the complexity and the issues with the experiments, they normally take up three years to be launched and carried out on board the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-35982024|title=Water fleas launched into space for Tim Peake experiment|date=2016-04-08|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Completion==
[[File:MissionDiscovery2014TeamPhoto.jpg|thumb|upright=2|A picture of one of the winning teams with an astronaut]]

On completion of the program, the winning team then has to wait and go through the process of their experiment idea being built from only their design. This is a process which involves the team working with a scientist who helps them make their experiment suitable for the space station, because what the students choose, meaning the specifics, isn't always the best way for it to be done. 

An example of this process in the team which won the program in Renfrewshire in 2014. For this group, the process of their ideas becoming the real thing lasted two years. This is because the experiment wasn't launched until the summer of 2016. During these two years, the team met up on a few occasions for events as well as experiment discussion sessions. The main experiment discussion session was held in 2014 when the team met with pharmacology lecturer from Kings College London, Julie Keeble, who was the main scientist involved in the development of their experiment. This session took place at the [[University of the West of Scotland]], where they spend time in the labs finding out how their experiment would be built and any changes that would need to be made to it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.paisley.org.uk/2014/11/science-kids-set-experiments-blast-off/&lt;/ref&gt; During the period between the first meeting and the launch, the students were also invited to an event which involved astronaut [[Mike Foale]]. The students took part in the day which involved meeting with Foale and listening to the talk he gave to the prospectus students for the 2015 program.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.paisley.org.uk/tag/mission-discovery/&lt;/ref&gt; These two above events were the main two events the students were involved in before their launch in the summer of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14416584.Pupils_prepare_for_blast_off_as_their_out_of_this_world_experiment_flies/|title=Pupils prepare for blast-off as their out-of-this-world experiment flies|website=HeraldScotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''monocular''' is a modified [[refracting telescope]] used to [[magnify]] the images of distant objects by passing light through a series of [[lens (optics)|lenses]] and usually [[Prism (optics)|prism]]s, the application of prisms resulting in a [[mass|lightweight]], compact telescope.  Volume and weight are less than half those of [[binoculars]] of similar optical properties, making a monocular easy to carry, and also proportionally less expensive. Monoculars produce 2-[[dimension]]al images, while binoculars add perception of depth (3 dimensions), assuming one has normal binocular vision.

Monoculars are ideally suited to those with vision in only one eye, or where compactness and low weight are important (e.g. hiking).  Monoculars are also sometimes preferred where difficulties occur using both eyes through binoculars because of significant eye variation or poor vision in one eye.

A monocular with a straight [[optical path]] is relatively long; prisms are normally used to fold the optical path to make an instrument which is much shorter (see the entry on [[binoculars]] for details).

[[Visually impaired people]] may use monoculars to see objects at distances at which people with normal vision do not have difficulty, e.g., to read text on a [[chalkboard]] or [[projection screen]]. Applications for viewing more distant objects include [[natural history]], [[hunting]], [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[military]].  Compact monoculars are also used in art galleries and museums to obtain a closer view of exhibits.

When high magnification, a bright image, and good resolution of distant images are required, a relatively larger instrument is preferred (i.e. a telescope), often mounted on a [[tripod]]. A smaller pocket-sized "pocket scope" (i.e. a typical monocular) can be used for less stringent applications.  These comments are quantified below.

Whereas there is a huge range of binoculars on the world market, monoculars are less widely available and with a limited choice in the top quality bracket, with some traditionally very high quality optical manufacturers not offering monoculars at all.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.swarovskioptik.com/?gclid=COHn6_HC48oCFQo6GwodbNYJ6Q&lt;/ref&gt;   Today, most monoculars are manufactured in Japan, China, Russia and Germany, with China offering more product variety than most.  Prices range widely, from the highest specification designs listed at over £300 down to "budget" offerings at under £10.  (As at Feb 2016).

==Monocular sizes==
As with [[binoculars]] and [[telescopes]], monoculars are primarily defined by two parameters: magnification and objective lens diameter, for example, 8x30 where 8 is the magnification and 30 is the objective lens diameter in mm (this is the lens furthest from the eye).  An 8x magnification makes the distant object appear to be 8 times larger at the eye. Contemporary monoculars are typically compact and most normally within a range of 4x magnification to 10x, although specialized units outside these limits are available.   Variable magnification or zoom is sometimes provided, but has drawbacks and is not normally found on the top quality monoculars. Objective lens diameter is typically in the range 20mm to 42mm.  Care is needed in interpreting some monocular specifications where numerical values are applied loosely and inaccurately - e.g. "39x95", which on a small cheap monocular is more likely to refer to the physical dimensions than the optical parameters. (This is covered in more detail in the section "Interpreting product specifications" below).

As with binoculars, possibly the most common and popular magnification for most purposes is 8x.  This represents a usable magnification in many circumstances and is reasonably easy to hold steady without a tripod or monopod.  At this magnification, the field of view is relatively wide, making it easier to locate and follow distant objects.  For viewing at longer distances, 10x or 12x is preferable if the user is able to hold the monocular steady.  However, increasing magnification will compromise the field of view and the relative brightness of the object.  These and other considerations are major factors influencing the choice of magnification and objective lens diameter.  Although very high numerical magnification sounds impressive on paper, in reality, for a pocket monocular it is rarely a good choice because of the very narrow field of view, poor image brightness and great difficulty in keeping the image still when hand holding.  Most serious users will eventually come to realise why 8x or 10x are so popular, as they represent possibly the best compromise and are the magnifications most commonly adopted in the very highest quality field monoculars (and binoculars).

Where a monocular ends and a telescope starts is debatable but a telescope is normally used for high magnifications (&gt;20x) and with correspondingly larger objective lens diameter (e.g. 60-90mm).   A telescope will be significantly heavier, more bulky and much more expensive than a monocular and due to the high magnifications, will normally need a tripod.   Most popular monocular sizes mimic popular binoculars – e.g. 7x25, 8x20, 8x30, 8x42, 10x42.

==Design==

Much of the basic design considerations and related parameters are the same as for [[binoculars]] and are covered in that entry, but some expanded comments have been added where appropriate:
*Prism type – porro or roof
*Lens &amp; prism coating (the quality of coating can significantly affect light transmission and image brightness and in the highest specifications is proportionally more expensive)
*[[Exit pupil]]
Exit pupil is defined as the diameter of the objective lens divided by the magnification and expressed in mm.  (e.g. a 8x40 will give an exit pupil diameter of 5mm).   For a given situation, the greater the exit pupil, the better the light transmission into the eye. Hence a large objective lens with a low magnification will give good light admission, especially important in deteriorating light conditions.  The classic 7x50 marine binocular or monocular is ideally suited to low light conditions with its relatively large exit pupil diameter of 7.1mm and a realistic magnification which is practical on a moving boat.  However, the exit pupil should be considered in relationship with the human eye pupil diameter.  If the exit pupil of the chosen instrument is greater than the human eye pupil then there will be no benefit, as the eye will be the limiting factor in light admission.  In effect, the extra light gathering potential is wasted. This is a consideration as one ages, because human eye pupil dilation range diminishes with age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.nd.edu/~kwb/OrtizBowyerFlynnBTAS_2013.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006011424/http://www3.nd.edu/~kwb/OrtizBowyerFlynnBTAS_2013.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.astronomics.com/binocular-specifications_t.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; as shown as an approximate guide in the table below.

*Twilight factor (related to magnification and objective lens diameter and is a guide to the ability to see ''detail'' at low light conditions and does not necessarily indicate brightness)
*Transmittance (the % of light transmitted through the monocular, indicating brightness, and will be over 90% in quality instruments)
*Field of view (important in being able to see a wide panorama and not appearing to be looking down a tunnel). 
Field of view (fov) and magnification are related; for a given situation, fov increases with decreasing magnification and vice versa.  This applies to monoculars, binoculars and telescopes.  However, this relationship also depends on optical design and manufacture, which can cause some variation.  The chart below has been compiled by the author to show the fov/magnification relationship based on best-in-class data, taken both from personal tests and from manufacturers' specifications.   Contrary to some belief, it is a myth that binoculars offer a wider field of view than monoculars.  For a given specification and manufacturer offering both monocular or binocular options of the same model, the field of view is exactly the same whether monocular or binocular.
[[File:Field of View v Magnification chart.pdf|thumb|centre|Chart of field of view (m @ 1000m) versus magnification based on best-in-class data]]
*Water/fog proofing
*General construction - material (metal, plastic), types of body coating
*Armoured body protection (to resist knocks and damage in the field)
*Lens protection/covers (some are integrated, some loose)
*Eye relief
Eye relief is a particularly important (but often overlooked) parameter for spectacle wearers if the full field of view is to be visible.  Although magnification, objective lens diameter and field of view (either in degrees or m @1000m) are often shown on the body of the monocular, eye relief virtually never is (except perhaps to say "long eye relief" or "LER"). Early optics tended to have short eye relief (sub 10mm) but more contemporary designs are now much better. At least 15mm is desirable - ideally nearer 20mm - for spectacle wearers. (See table of eye reliefs below, noting the best in class, Opticron 5x30 at 25mm and Opticron 8x42 DBA at 21mm). Eye relief can seriously compromise the field of view if too short, so even if an optic has a good field of view specification, without an accompanying long eye relief, the benefit of the wide view will not be obtained (again, only applying to spectacle wearers). Good eye relief can greatly be facilitated by the eye lens diameter. The photograph below shows a comparison between two 8x monoculars, the one on the left typical of a 1980s design and with a relatively small eyepiece lens diameter (11mm) and sub 10mm eye relief.  The one on the right is more contemporary - from 2016 - and with a relatively large eyepiece diameter (24mm) and approx. 15mm eye relief.   This large eyepiece lens not only helps eye relief but also helps to create a wider field of view.

Two additional aspects, which are particularly relevant in the context of monoculars are:
*Focusing mechanism

A significant difference between binoculars and monoculars is in the focusing system.  Today, binoculars almost universally use a central wheel focusing system, operating on both sides simultaneously although on some large observation binoculars, as well as some older designs, individual focusing on each eyepiece is sometimes used. Monoculars, however, employ a variety of different focusing systems, all with pros and cons. These include:
*A large knurled focusing ring around the body of the monocular&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opticron.co.uk/Pages/bga_mono.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*A small focusing ring close to the eyepiece&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luger-optik.de/binoculars-monoculars/luger-md-6x30.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*A small external focusing wheel alongside and above the monocular&lt;ref&gt;http://bushnell.com/all-products/spotting-scopes/legend-ultra-hd/monocular&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Wheel focus systems on 2 monoculars.jpg|thumb|Asika 8x42 and Visionary 12x50 showing top wheel focusing]]
*A small focusing lever&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opticron.co.uk/Pages/t3_mono.html&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Opticron Trailfinder monocular.jpg|thumb|Opticron Trailfinder 8x25 showing focusing lever]]
*A sliding focus button&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minox.com/index.php?id=md_6_8x16_series&amp;L=1&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Eschenbach 6x16 monocular.jpg|thumb|right|Eschenbach 6x16 showing sliding focus button]]
*A toggle focus mechanism on top of the monocular&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificsonline.com/product/carson-bandit-monocular&lt;/ref&gt;
*A large knurled ring surrounding the objective lens&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minox.com/index.php?id=macroscope&amp;L=1&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Dual focus" where there are two focusing rings.

The most common is the focusing ring around the body.   This retains the compactness of the unit but requires two hands to operate and does not give particularly fast focusing.  In some units, the ring can be stiff to operate.

The small ring near the eyepiece also usually needs two hands to operate and in some designs can interfere with the twist-up eye cup.  Being small, it can also be less convenient to operate, especially wearing gloves. The degree of twist from closest focus to infinity varies between manufacturers.  Some use a very small twist&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opticsreviewer.com/vortex-solo-monocular.html&lt;/ref&gt; (about a quarter of a turn) whereas others use a full turn or more.  The small degree of twist gives a very fast focus but can be overly sensitive and in some designs too stiff to use single handed.  A full turn is a practical compromise.

A focusing wheel tends not to be used on top quality monoculars (with the exception of the Bushnell 10x42HD Legend) but is particularly popular on budget offerings from China.   Although it makes the monocular more bulky, it does give very convenient focusing with one hand (via one finger) and is particularly fast and smooth, which is necessary in circumstances where quick, accurate changes of focus are important (e.g. bird watching in a wood).

A focusing lever is not common but is used, for example, on the Opticron Trailfinder.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opticron.co.uk/Pages/t3_mono.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This mechanism provides very quick focusing while retaining compactness but can be stiff and overly sensitive to use and again ideally needs two hands.  

Minox and some others use a slider button, rather than a lever, on low magnification, ultra compact designs, pushed side to side, which is also fast but rather sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minox.com/index.php?id=md_6_8x16_series&amp;L=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Toggle focus is very rarely used (e.g. Carson Bandit 8x25&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificsonline.com/product/carson-bandit-monocular&lt;/ref&gt; ).  It provides a one-handed focus mechanism in a relatively large toggle, making it quick and easy to operate "in the field" with gloves but can be rather over-sensitive and difficult to fine tune.

The knurled ring around the objective lens appears to be a unique feature of the Minox 8x25 Macroscope and claims to provide quick focusing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minox.com/index.php?id=macroscope&amp;L=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Some low budget entry-level monoculars from China claim “dual focusing”, which means focusing by means of twisting either the main body of the monocular, and/or the smaller ring near the eyepiece (referred to as the dioptre adjustment on binoculars).   Quite why dual focusing is felt necessary on a monocular is questionable but could be for marketing reasons;  there is no real technical benefit with such a system, which is never found on the top-quality monoculars from manufacturers like Opticron, Leica and Zeiss.

*Zoom or variable magnification

As with binoculars, zoom magnification is sometimes available but is virtually unknown in the best quality units (both binoculars and monoculars) as the optical quality and field of view are seriously compromised.   Although zoom systems are widely and successfully used on cameras, for observation optics, zoom systems with any credibility are reserved for top quality spotting scopes&lt;ref&gt;https://uk.leica-camera.com/Sport-Optics/Leica-Birding/Spotting-Scopes/Leica-Eyepiece&lt;/ref&gt; and come with a very high price tag.   Zoom monoculars are available from some “budget” manufacturers, which sound impressive on paper but often have extreme and unrealistic magnification ranges as well as an extremely narrow field of view.

==Interpreting product specifications==

As mentioned previously, product specifications can sometimes be misleading, confusing or incorrect values stated. Such inaccuracies are more commonly found on budget items but have also sometimes been seen from some brand leaders.  For those not experienced in interpreting such specifications, it is always wise to try out the item before buying wherever possible.  Some of the descriptors needing particular care with include:

*	Basic size (e.g. 8x30).   As mentioned earlier, examples are sometimes seen where product physical dimensions or some other arbitrary figures are stated instead of magnification and objective lens diameter. This is very misleading and does not properly describe the product.   Examples seen include a “40x60” in a compact monocular, where the objective lens diameter was actually 40mm (and the magnification was certainly not 40x). Another, described as "35x95", was actually a 20x40.   Also, in a few cases, the overall diameter of the case surrounding the objective lens is used, rather than the lens itself, thus making it seem the objective lens is bigger than it truly is.   Magnifications can also be exaggerated, an example of a claimed 16x in reality being closer to an 8x, with the number "16" probably referring to the eyepiece lens diameter.   In this case, the claimed "16x52" was in reality an "8x42".   Care is needed with such misleading and exaggerated specifications, more likely to be found on some very low budget items.
*	“Day-night vision" or sometimes just "night vision" is another misleading descriptor commonly seen in the specification of low-end, budget monoculars as it gives the impression the item is a night-vision instrument, effective in darkness, when it clearly is not.  True night vision monoculars (or "image intensifiers", as typically used in military applications for example) use an electrical power source for light enhancement and are substantially more expensive and bulky than a comparable normal monocular.
*	Zoom is sometimes stated where there is no zoom facility.  Zoom means a ''variable'' magnification facility, as often seen on cameras, for example. The term "zoom" or misleading phrases like "power zoom" or "mega zoom" are used incorrectly when referring to a single magnification optic.  Zoom values will always be two numbers separated by a hyphen (e.g. 8-20) and then followed by the objective lens diameter (e.g. 8-20x50). As mentioned elsewhere in this entry, a true zoom facility can be seen on some budget monoculars but with very significant optical limitations.
*	Field of view (fov) specification.   This parameter is sometimes stated incorrectly (over-stated) and needs interpreting with care when buying an instrument without first field-testing.    It is normally expressed in degrees, m@1000m or ft@1000yds.   An approximate conversion from degrees to m@1000m is to multiply degrees by 17.5 which can be used as a check if both values are stated.   The author has carried out fov tests on several monoculars and the results shown in the table below.    Generally, the manufacturer’s stated figure is accurate within a few % but two were considerably over-stated, one in particular (9x30) by 30%. When reviewing a claimed fov value, reference can be made to the fov/magnification relationship in Design, above.  This relationship represents best-in-class and so anything substantially exceeding a fov value from this plot, for a given magnification, should be treated with caution, especially in budget offerings.

The '''National Research Council''' ('''NRC''', {{lang-fr|Conseil national de recherches Canada}}) is the primary national research and technology organization (RTO) of the [[Government of Canada]],{{Sfn|Government of Canada|nd}} in science and technology [[research and development]].{{Sfn|Government of Canada|nd}} The Minister of Innovation, Science, and Economic Development is responsible for the National Research Council. The transformation of the NRC into an RTO that focuses on "business-led research" was part of the federal government's Economic Action Plan.{{Sfn|Government of Canada|nd}} On 7 May 2013, the NRC launched its new "business approach" in which it offered four business lines: strategic research and development, technical services, management of science and technology infrastructure and NRC-Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP). With these services, NRC intended to shorten the gap between early stage research and development and commercialization.{{Sfn|Government of Canada|nd}} At one point, NRC had over 30 approved programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/collaborative/index.html|title=Research programs and collaboration opportunities - National Research Council Canada|first=Government of Canada. National Research Council|last=Canada|date=|website=www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenure of [[John R. McDougall (Petroleum Engineer)|John McDougall]] as President of the NRC (2010–2016) was marked by a number of controversies. His presidency was characterised by a dramatic drop in publications and patents,&lt;ref name="Ottawa Citizen"&gt;{{cite web | title=Science minister responds after NRC shakeup, but with few details | website=Ottawa Citizen | date=2016-04-09 | url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/science-minister-responds-after-nrc-shakeup-but-with-few-details | access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; by significant cuts in scientific staff,&lt;ref name="Ottawa Citizen 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=NRC's five-year brain drain dealt 'a serious whack' to research | website=Ottawa Citizen | date=2016-09-22 | url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/nrcs-five-year-brain-drain-dealt-a-serious-whack-to-research | access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by a 23-month period during which NRC management was aware that the organization was contaminating the water table in a small Ontario community but did not inform that community's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/nrc-drinking-water-mississippi-mills-toxic-chemicals-1.3601591&lt;/ref&gt; 

John McDougall's departure – signalled by a sudden, three-line email to employees in March 2016 announced that he was going on personal leave. During this time Maria Aubrey, Vice President of NRC, filled the role as Acting President.&lt;ref name="ottawacitizen.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/national-research-council-president-on-leave-no-reason-given|title=National Research Council president on leave, no reason given|author=|date=4 April 2016|website=ottawacitizen.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective August 24, 2016, Iain Stewart became the new President of the NRC.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/about/corporate_overview/biographies/iain_stewart.html|title=Iain Stewart - National Research Council Canada|first=Government of Canada.

=== Algal Carbon Conversion Flagship Program ===

The goal of the Algal Carbon Conversion Pilot Program {{Sfn|NRC|2013c}} was to develop of an algae system to recycle carbon emissions from the oil sands. It contained plans for a $19 million facility to be constructed in Alberta, in partnership between the NRC [[Canadian Natural Resources Limited]| Canadian Natural] and Pond Biofuels.{{Sfn|NRC|2013c}}

In 2008 researchers from five I-CAN organizations were developing a Carbon Algae Recycling System (CARS) to "feed waste heat and flue gas containing CO2 from industrial exhaust stacks to micro-algae growing in artificial ponds".{{Sfn|I-CAN|2008|page=11}}  The "Algal Carbon Conversion",{{Sfn|NRC|2013c}} is related to prior interests of Mr. McDougall, as he previously headed Innoventures, a company involved in lobbying for the development of an algae system to recycle carbon emissions.{{Sfn|Sixth Estate|2011}} The Algal Carbon Conversion Pilot Project, with plans for a $19 million facility to be constructed in Alberta, is a partnership between the NRC and industry partners, [[Canadian Natural Resources Limited]] (Canadian Natural) and Pond Biofuels.{{Sfn|NRC|2013c}} The NRC was not involved in this area of research prior to the arrival of Mr. McDougall.

=== The Canadian Wheat Improvement Flagship ===

The Canadian Wheat Improvement Program is a "strategic collaboration with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), the University of Saskatchewan’s Crop Development Centre and the province of Saskatchewan".{{Sfn|NRC|2013e}}{{Sfn|National Research Council Canada|2013}} With a budget of approximately $97 million (2013–2018), the Canadian Wheat Alliance will be conducting research on improving the yield of Canadian wheat crops and on the most efficient use of chemical fertilizers.{{Sfn|National Research Council Canada|2013}} Working with breeders and scientists at the Crop Development Centre and at AAFC, they will be integrating long term research with genetic improvement of wheat.{{Sfn|http://canadianwheatalliance.ca/}}

=== Gallium Nitride (GaN) Electronics Program ===

The GaN Electronics program supports partner research and development activities with a goal of ensuring that GaN technology will create wealth and a greener future for Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/collaborative/gan_index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805231215/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/collaborative/gan_index.html |archive-date=2014-08-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NRC is the only Canadian foundry for GaN electronics, and offers both normally-on and normally-off devices. The GaN500v2 Foundry Design Kit was released on June 28, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/advisory/gan_design_index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905072551/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/advisory/gan_design_index.html |archive-date=2014-09-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compoundsemiconductor.net/article/94489-national-research-council-of-canada-announces-gan-design-kit.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP) ===

The National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC-IRAP) was introduced in the 1950s to support product developments in small to medium-sized businesses. The NRC provides grants and financial support to business' looking to bring new and innovative technologies to the market.{{Sfn|NRC|2012a}}

Some of the many innovations by NRC personnel included the [[artificial pacemaker]], development of [[Canola|canola (rapeseed)]] in the 1940s, the Crash Position Indicator in the 1950s, and the Cesium Beam [[atomic clock]] in the 1960s.

Since 1974 Paul Barton of [[PSB Speakers]] used the NRC's world-class measurement facilities, their anechoic chamber. By the 1980s more companies began to use this incredible resource and began to develop at the NRC. Even small companies had access to these facilities for loudspeaker measurements of high quality, offering them a competitive edge.{{Sfn|Schneider|2000}}  Eventually almost every major Canadian company including Energy Loudspeakers and Paradigm Electronics, tested their loudspeakers at the NRC. Electrical engineer, Floyd E. Toole, who worked at the NRC was at the centre of this research.{{Sfn|Schneider|2000}} By the year 2000 most companies had their own sound chambers, but Paul Barton continued to use the NRC's facilities. In about 1990, PSB and other Canadian companies worked with the NRC on Athena to evaluate digital signal processing (DSP) for loudspeaker design.{{Sfn|Schneider|2000}}

{{quote|The metal walls of the NRC’s anechoic chamber are located about a foot and a half from the internal walls that surround it. The whole chamber is suspended on springs. This makes it a building within the M-37 building. The purpose of all this is to provide a completely isolated environment that, according to Barton, registers a noise level that is less than 0dB. (0dB is a statistical average of the lowest level of human hearing.) Wedges made from fiberglass are inside the chamber, and they help create the reflection-free environment. No sound gets in, none gets out, and what occurs within gets completely absorbed with nary a bounce.|Schneider|2000}}

From 2002 to 2006, John R. McDougall, who was appointed President of NRC in 2010, was a member of the NRC-Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC-IRAP) Advisory Board.{{Sfn|Genome Canada|2014}}

In 2011 Bev Oda Minister of International Cooperation and Gary Goodyear, Minister of State (Science and Technology) announced the grant recipients. These included small to medium-sized businesses, such as, Nortek Solutions a privately owned Canadian software company. They received a $30,000 grant from NRC to hire a young graphics design graduate to work on their "CUROS" people management software. Oasys Healthcare, a company that provides "innovative audio and video solutions for the medical marketplace" received a $13,000 NRC grant for its new technology for operation rooms. Jeffrey Ross Jewellery's product called Dimples, imprints fingerprints in silver using an innovative process and material, developed through a NRC $35,750 grant.{{Sfn|Alexander|2011}}

== Employment ==
Close to 4,000 people across Canada are employed by the NRC. In addition, NRC also employs guest workers from universities, companies, and public and private-sector organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aboutUs/facts_e.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210035840/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aboutUs/facts_e.html |date=December 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nobel Prizes ==
Several Nobel Laureates have been associated with the NRC at various points of their careers

* [[John Polanyi]] – Postdoctoral Fellow, Nobel Prize in Chemistry
* [[Rudolph A. Marcus]] – Postdoctoral Fellow, Nobel Prize in Chemistry
* [[Gerhard Herzberg]] – Director of the Division of Pure Physics, Nobel Prize in Chemistry
* [[Donna Strickland]] – Research Associate, Nobel Prize in Physics

== History ==
[[File:National Research Council Canada Laboratories 2014 p2.jpg|thumb|NRC laboratories on Sussex Drive in Ottawa]]
The NRC was established in 1916 under the pressure of [[World War I]] to advise the government on matters of science and industrial research. In 1932, laboratories were built on Sussex Drive in [[Ottawa]].

With the impetus of [[World War II]], the NRC grew rapidly and for all practical purposes became a military science and weapons research organization. It undertook a number of important projects, which included participation with the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] in the development of chemical and germ warfare agents, the explosive [[RDX]], the proximity fuse, [[radar]], and submarine detection techniques. A special branch known as the Examination Unit was involved with cryptology and the interception of enemy radio communications.
According to the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] website, the NRC headquarters in Ottawa "was a prime espionage target" during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikipedia.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609061150/http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/en/about_us/history_artifacts/artifacts/art_intro_004.asp |archivedate=2007-06-09 |title=
The National Research Council headquarters in Ottawa |publisher=Canadian Security Intelligence Service |accessdate=2009-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NRC was also engaged in atomic fission research at the [[Tube Alloys#Montreal Laboratory|Montreal Laboratory]], then the [[Chalk River Laboratories]] in Ontario.

Post-WWII, the NRC reverted to its pre-war civilian role and a number of wartime activities were spun off to newly formed organizations. Military research continued under a new organization, the [[Defence Research and Development Canada|Defence Research Board]], while inventions with commercial potential were transferred to the newly formed [[Canadian Patents and Development Limited]]. Atomic research went to the newly created [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]]. Foreign signals intelligence gathering officially remained with the agency when, by Order in Council, the Examination Unit became the Communications Branch of the NRC in 1946. The CBNRC was transferred to the Department of National Defence in 1975, and renamed the [[Communications Security Establishment]]. During the 1950s, the medical research funding activities of the NRC were handed over to the newly formed [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research|Medical Research Council of Canada]].

Finally, on May 1, 1978, with the rapid post-war growth of Canadian universities the NRC's role in university research funding in the natural sciences was passed to the [[NSERC|Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada]].

Under financial pressure in the 1980s, the federal government produced what popularly became known as the Neilson Report, which recommended across-the-board financial cuts to all federal government organizations, including the NRC. This led to staff and program cutbacks.

In 2000, there were about 1000 NRC researchers with Ph.D.s conducting research in many areas.{{Sfn|Schneider|2000}}

Recovery was slow, but the NRC has managed to regain its status as Canada's single most important scientific and engineering research institution among many other [[Canadian government scientific research organizations]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

As President of the National Research Council Canada, chemist Arthur Carty revitalised the organisation. In 2004 he left the NRC when then prime minister Paul Martin appointed him as independent, non-partisan advisor on science and technology.{{Sfn|Nature|2008|page=866}} 

Around June 2014, the NRC was reportedly penetrated by Chinese state-sponsored hackers.&lt;ref name="forced"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' |title=How the US Forced China to Quit Stealing—Using a Chinese Spy |url=https://www.wired.com/story/us-china-cybertheft-su-bin/ |first=Garrett M. |last=Graff |date=October 11, 2018 |quote=Around the same time when the FBI was asking for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s help in detaining Su Bin, according to The Globe and Mail, Canada was responding to a massive attack by state-sponsored Chinese hackers who had penetrated the network of its National Research Council, which leads the country’s research and development efforts. (China denied the accusation.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, much of the NRC's focus is on developing partnerships with private and public-sector technology companies, both nationally and internationally. Under the federal Minister of State for Science and Technology, [[Gary Goodyear]], the NRC became a "toolbox for industry" and dented basic-research infrastructure.{{Sfn|Himelfarb|2014}} &lt;ref group=notes&gt;"Goodyear, the minister of state for science and technology, has presided over the most retrograde federal Science and Technology policy in memory. During his tenure, the government shuttered the office of the National Science Adviser, blocked asbestos from a UN hazardous chemicals list on which it clearly belongs, gutted the Fisheries Act, gutted the Navigable Waters Protection Act, set out to weaken the Species at Risk Act, killed the long-form census, eroded Environment Canada’s ability to monitor climate change, earned an international reputation for muzzling scientists and, at a great potential cost, defunded the world’s leading freshwater research centre... At the same time, changes to our science-funding regime and a makeover of the National Research Council, Canada’s science agency, into a tool box for industry have dented our basic-research infrastructure and damaged our prospects for innovation (Himelfarb 2014)."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Restriction on government scientists to communicate with media ===
Under the tenure of Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], Canadian Government research organizations began to restrict the ability of government scientists to communicate with the public.{{Sfn|Nature|2008|page=866}} This includes restricting scientists within the NRC to communicate with the public through non-scientist communications personnel. Harper's focus as an economist was on his action plan: creating jobs and building the economy. There were widespread concerns that the progress in development was at the cost of the environment.

In 2012, the federal government moved "to defund government research centers in the High Arctic." In the same year National Research Council environmental scientists "were barred from discussing their work on snowfall with the media.&lt;ref name="NYT_closed_mind"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/opinion/sunday/the-closing-of-the-canadian-mind.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0 | title=The Closing of the Canadian Mind | work=New York Times | date=14 August 2015 | accessdate=14 August 2015 | author=Stephen Marche | location=Toronto | series=Sunday Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Scientists for the governmental agency Environment Canada, under threat of losing their jobs, were banned from discussing their research without political approval. Mentions of federal climate change research in the Canadian press have dropped 80 percent. The union that represents federal scientists and other professionals has, for the first time in its history, abandoned neutrality to campaign against Mr. Harper.|''New York Times''}}

=== Appointment of John McDougall as NRC Director in 2010; controversies; his departure in 2016 and replacement by Iain Stewart ===
The appointment of [[John R. McDougall (Petroleum Engineer)|John McDougall]], who promoted the partnering of science and technology research and development with industry partners, as President of NRC was followed by several controversies. During his tenure as President, there was a steep drop in research publications and new patents from NRC as scientific staff was cut significantly. An article published in April 2016 and based on information from the office of the Science Minister gave the following figures for the period 2011-2015: "In the five years from 2011 through 2015, the number of studies in academic journals were 1,889, 1,650, 1,204, 1,017 and 549, respectively. (Figures from 2010 and earlier are generally in the 1,200 to 1,300 range.) The number of patents over the period 2011 to 2014 (with no figure available for 2015) are: 205, 251, 128 and 112, respectively. The years before 2011 averaged 250 to 300 patents per year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/science-minister-responds-after-nrc-shakeup-but-with-few-details|title=Science minister responds after NRC shakeup, but with few details|author=|date=9 April 2016|website=ottawacitizen.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the decline in the number of academic journal papers by NRC authors over the period 2011-2015 was 71%, and the decline in the number of new patents with NRC inventors over the period 2011-2014 was 45%. In September 2016, the office of the Science Minister released figures showing that from 2010 to 2015, the number of research officers at NRC fell by 26 percent, and the number of scientists and engineers of all kinds fell by 22 percent. “The job losses generally parallel the presidency of John McDougall”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/nrcs-five-year-brain-drain-dealt-a-serious-whack-to-research|title=NRC's five-year brain drain dealt 'a serious whack' to research|author=|date=22 September 2016|website=ottawacitizen.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John McDougall's tenure as President included the period during which the NRC contaminated the water table in the Eastern Ontario community of Mississippi Mills without informing its inhabitants. In January 2014, NRC employees at the fire-safety testing facility in Mississippi Mills were told to start drinking bottled water.(citation needed) 23 months later (December 2015), residents of Mississippi Mills with homes near the facility were warned by NRC that their well-water was contaminated with toxic chemicals called perfluorinated alkyl substances, often found in firefighting foam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/nrc-drinking-water-mississippi-mills-toxic-chemicals-1.3601591|title=Toxic chemicals used in fire-fighting foam discovered in water in 2013 - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Acting President Maria Aubrey formally acknowledged that the NRC's National Fire Laboratory was the source of the groundwater contamination in Mississippi Mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/mayor-says-nrc-admits-its-the-source-of-mississippi-mills-water-contamination|title=NRC admits it's the source of Mississippi Mills water contamination|author=|date=8 July 2016|website=ottawacitizen.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, it was reported that owners of homes near the lab in Mississippi Mills were launching a multi-million dollar lawsuit against NRC over water contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/mississippi-mills-residents-sue-nrc-for-40m-over-water-contamination|title=Mississippi Mills residents sue NRC for $40M over water contamination|author=|date=6 December 2016|website=ottawacitizen.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, John McDougall sent a three-sentence email to NRC employees, announcing that he was going on personal leave.&lt;ref name="ottawacitizen.com"/&gt; Subsequently, NRC management announced that two major projects he had led would be abandoned: re-branding the NRC as "CNRCSolutions" – though colourful "CNRCSolutions" T-shirts and "branding books" had already been distributed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/nrc-not-quite-rebranded|title=NRC 'solutions' rebranding quietly dropped without explanation|author=|date=6 April 2016|website=ottawacitizen.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and re-organizing its three research divisions into five research divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/nrc-president-mcdougall-officially-departs-but-reasons-are-still-secret|title=NRC president McDougall officially departs — but reasons are still secret|author=|date=29 July 2016|website=ottawacitizen.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective August 24, 2016, Iain Stewart became the new President of the NRC.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The details regarding McDougall's personal leave were not publicly disclosed. 

=== Bill C-38 ===
[[Bill C-38]] angered many people who opposed unregulated industrial growth. They argued that science was being gutted and silenced to open the way for development in ecologically sensitive areas in the north.{{Sfn|Environmental Hansard|2013}}

In June 2012, the federal opposition made a motion in parliament,{{Sfn|Enviro-Hansard|2012}}
{{quote|That, in the opinion of the House, Canadian scientific and social science expertise is of great value and, therefore, the House calls on the Government to end its muzzling of scientists; to reverse the cuts to research programs at Environment Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Library and Archives Canada, National Research Council Canada, Statistics Canada, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; and to cancel the closures of the National Council of Welfare and the First Nations Statistical Institute.|2012}}

'''NihongoUp''' was an [[Adobe AIR]] desktop [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[educational game]] and reviewing tool. The program featured several game modes which allowed the player to improve their [[kana]] typing and reading speed, review [[JLPT]] kanji and vocabulary, and learn [[Japanese grammar]] in context. The game was compatible with [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]]. [[IPhone OS|iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Windows Phone 7]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

In 2010, NihongoUp evolved into a full-fledged online Japanese language learning community which included interactive lessons, online review exercises, downloadable applications, and cheat sheets, designed to provide a complete solution for learners of the Japanese language. In 2011, this content was ported to [http://lingualift.com/ LinguaLift], a blended learning platform offering courses for several world languages.

==Features==
The NihongoUp game was separated into four different modes. In the Hiragana and Katakana modes, the player was supposed to shoot down balloons by typing the correct reading of the characters written on them. In the [[Kanji]], Vocabulary, Particles and Counters modes, the player was presented with an incomplete sentence and had to choose the correct character or word to be placed into the marked part of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4318">The '''Compulsory Education Act''' or '''Oregon School Law''' was a 1922 law in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]] that required school age children to attend only public schools. The [[United States Supreme Court]] later struck down the law as unconstitutional.

==Background==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
In 1922, the [[Anticlericalism and Freemasonry|Masonic]] Grand Lodge of Oregon sponsored an initiative to require all school-age children to attend public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposed Constitutional Amendments and Measures to be submitted to the Voters of the State of Oregon for the General Election, Tuesday, November 7, 1922|url=http://library.state.or.us/repository/2010/201003011350161/ORVPGenMari1922.pdf|publisher=Sam A. Kozer, Secretary of State|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With support also of the state [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Oregon gubernatorial election, 1922|1922 Democratic gubernatorial candidate]] [[Walter M. Pierce]], the Compulsory Education Law was passed by a vote of 115,506 to 103,685.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Initiative, Referendum and Recall: 1922-1928|url=https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/state/elections/history.aspx|website=Oregon Blue Book|publisher=Oregon Secretary of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its primary purpose was to shut down Catholic schools in Oregon, but it also affected other private and military schools. It was challenged in court and struck down by the United States Supreme Court ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' (1925) before it went into effect.

The law, which was officially called the Compulsory Education Act and unofficially became known as the Oregon School Law, did not just require that children between the ages of eight and sixteen had to attend school; it required that they attend only public schools.  By prohibiting children from attending private or parochial schools, the state thus forced such schools to close.

Outraged Catholics organized locally and nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools. In a 1925 decision, the United States Supreme Court declared the Oregon School Law unconstitutional in a ruling that has been called "the Magna Carta of the parochial school system."  In the ruling, the Court asserted that "the child is not the mere creature of the state" and settled once and for all the question of whether or not private schools had a right to exist in The United States.

[[Pope Pius XI]], in 1929, explicitly referenced this Supreme Court case in his [[encyclical]] ''Divini illius magistri''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Divini illius magistri|author=[[Pope Pius XI]]|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html|date=1929-12-31|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Catholic school|Catholic education]]. He quoted this part of the case, which says:&lt;blockquote&gt;The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right coupled with the high duty, to recognize, and prepare him for additional duties.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It offers nine UG, PG, Ph.D. courses on [[Chemical Engineering]], [[Petroleum Refining]] and [[Petrochemicals]], Industrial [[Biotechnology]], [[Ceramic]] Technology, [[Textile]] Technology, [[Apparel]] Technology, [[Food]] Technology, [[Pharmaceutical technology]] and [[Leather]] Technology.

==Petrovision'10 and Petrovision '11 (previous editions)==

Petrovision was started in the year 2010 as a one-day seminar throwing light upon the recent trends in hydrocarbon processing.
In the year 2011, Petrovision was aggrandized into a two-day technical seminar inclusive of exciting events to encourage the student community. The event was inaugurated by Mr. Venkataramana, Director (Operations), [[Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited]] followed by his lecture on "Changing Energy Sources". The important aspect of the event was that it had blended management with technology.

Lectures by Lt. Col.Jitendira Prasad, General Manager, [[Oil and Natural Gas Corporation]] ([[ONGC]]) and Chairman for the Chennai Section of [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] (SPE); Dr. G.D. Yadhav, Vice Chancellor, [[Institute of Chemical Technology]] and Mr. M.Shiva Kumar,Director/ Chief Regional Coordinator, [[Petroleum Conservation Research Association]] (PCRA) added color to the event.

Petrovision'11 covered a wide range of current and emerging issues that are prevalent in the minds of Petroleum Engineers, Petrochemists and researchers in our country. It provided a platform for students, teachers and technocrats to discuss and discover problems and opportunities in production and utilization of Energy.

==Petrovision'12==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20948">'''Scientific literacy''' or '''Science literacy''' encompasses [[scientific writing|written]], [[mathematics|numerical]], and [[information technology|digital]] [[literacy]]  as they pertain to understanding [[science]], its [[scientific method|methodology]], [[observation]]s, and [[scientific theory|theories]].

== Definition ==

The OECD PISA Framework (2015) defines scientific literacy as "the ability to engage with science-related issues, and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.oecd.org/callsfortenders/Annex%20IA_%20PISA%202015%20Science%20Framework%20.pdf |title=PISA 2015 Science Framework |date=March 2013 |publisher=OECD |accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientifically literate person, therefore, is willing to engage in reasoned discourse about science 
and technology which requires the competencies to:
* Explain phenomena scientifically &amp;ndash; recognize, offer and evaluate explanations for a range of natural and technological phenomena.
* Evaluate and design scientific inquiry &amp;ndash; describe and appraise scientific investigations and propose ways of addressing questions scientifically.
* Interpret data and evidence scientifically &amp;ndash; analyze and evaluate data, claims and arguments in a variety of representations and draw appropriate scientific conclusions.

According to the United States National Center for Education Statistics, "scientific literacy is the knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes required for personal decision making, participation in civic and cultural affairs, and economic productivity".&lt;ref name=NCES&gt;{{harvnb|NAS|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientifically literate person is defined as one who has the capacity to:

* Understand, [[experiment]], and [[reason]] as well as interpret scientific facts and their meaning.
* Ask, find, or determine answers to questions derived from curiosity about everyday experiences.
* Describe, explain, and predict [[natural phenomena]].
* Read articles with understanding of science in the [[popular press]] and engage in social conversation about the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the conclusions.
* Identify scientific issues underlying national and local decisions and express positions that are scientifically and technologically informed.
* Evaluate the quality of scientific information on the basis of its source and the methods used to generate it.
* Pose and evaluate [[arguments]] based on evidence and to apply conclusions from such arguments appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NAS|1996|loc=page 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scientific literacy may also be defined in language similar to the definitions of [[ocean literacy]],&lt;ref name = OL&gt;{{harvnb|OLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earth science literacy]]&lt;ref name=ESL&gt;{{harvnb|ESLI|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Climate Literacy]].&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{harvnb|CLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus a scientifically literate person can:
* Understand the science relevant to environmental and social issues.
* Communicate clearly about the science.
* Make informed decisions about these issues.

Finally, scientific literacy may involve particular attitudes toward learning and using science. A scientifically-literate citizen is capable of researching matters of fact for him or herself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYHQcXVp4F4 Noam Chomsky on what it means to be educated]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Reforms in [[science education]] in the United States have often been driven by strategic challenges such as the launch of the [[Sputnik program|Sputnik satellite]] in 1957 and the [[Japanese economic miracle|Japanese economic boom]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutherford|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, scientific literacy is now taken to mean that everyone should have a working knowledge of science and its role in society. Science literacy is seen as a right of every person and a requirement for [[Citizenship|responsible members of society]], one that helps average people to make better decisions and enrich their lives. The shift occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the publication of ''Science for All Americans''&lt;ref name=Rutherford1991&gt;{{harvnb|Rutherford |Ahlgren |1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Benchmarks for Science Literacy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | American Association for the Advancement of Science |1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial definitions of science literacy included elaborations of the actual content that people should understand, and this content often followed somewhat traditional lines ([[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]]). [[Earth science]] was somewhat narrowly defined as expanded geological processes. In the decade after those initial documents, ocean scientists and educators revised the notion of science literacy to include more contemporary, systems-oriented views of the natural world, leading to scientific literacy programs for the [[ocean]], [[climate]], [[earth science]], and so on. This shift has ensured that educators' views of science literacy stay in sync with the directions and advances of real science in the real world.

==Science, society, and the environment ==
The interdependence of humans and our natural environment is at the heart of scientific literacy in the Earth systems. As defined by nationwide consensus among scientists and educators, this literacy has two key parts. First, a literate person is defined, in language that echoes the above definition of scientific literacy. Second, a set of concepts are listed, organized into six to nine big ideas or essential principles. This defining process was undertaken first for [[ocean literacy]],&lt;ref name = OL&gt;{{harvnb|OLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; then for the [[Great Lakes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OSGCP|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estuary|estuaries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NOAA|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[atmosphere]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UCAR|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and climate.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{harvnb|CLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Earth science literacy]]&lt;ref name=ESL&gt;{{harvnb|ESLI|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the types of literacy defined for Earth systems; the qualities of an Earth science literate person are representative of the qualities for all the Earth system literacy definitions.

According to the Earth Science Literacy Initiative, an Earth-science-literate person:
* understands the fundamental concepts of Earth’s many systems
* knows how to find and assess scientifically credible information about Earth
* communicates about Earth science in a meaningful way
* is able to make informed and responsible decisions regarding Earth and its resources&lt;ref name=ESL/&gt;

All types of literacy in Earth systems have a definition like the above. Ocean literacy is further defined as "understanding our impact on the ocean and the ocean's impact on us".&lt;ref name=OL/&gt;
Similarly, the climate literacy website includes a guiding principle for decision making; "humans can take action to reduce climate change and its impacts".&lt;ref name=CL/&gt; Each type of Earth systems literacy then defines the concepts students should understand upon graduation from high school. Current educational efforts in Earth systems literacy tend to focus more on the scientific concepts than on the decision-making aspect of literacy, but environmental action remains as a stated goal.

The theme of science in a socially-relevant context appears in many discussions of scientific literacy. Ideas that turn up in the life sciences include an allusion to [[ecological literacy]], the "well-being of earth". Robin Wright, a writer for ''Cell Biology Education'', laments "will [undergraduates'] misunderstandings or lack of knowledge about science imperil our democratic way of life and national security?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discussion of physics literacy includes [[energy conservation]], [[ozone depletion]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The mission statement of the Chemistry Literacy Project &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CLP|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes environmental and social justice.
Technological literacy is defined in a three-dimensional coordinate space; on the knowledge axis, it is noted that technology can be risky, and that it "reflects the values and culture of society".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gamire|Pearson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Energy Literacy boasts several websites, including one associated with climate literacy&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;
and two advocacy organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ELA|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ELP|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes as part of scientific literacy==
Attitudes about science can have a significant effect on scientific literacy. In [[education theory]], understanding of content lies in the cognitive domain, while attitudes lie in the affective domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Engelhart|Furst|Hill|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, negative attitudes, such as fear of science, can act as an [[affective filter]] and an impediment to comprehension and future learning goals. Studies of college students' attitudes about learning physics suggest that these attitudes may be divided into categories of real world connections, personal connections, conceptual connections, student effort and problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Perkins|Podolefsky|Dubson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision-making aspect of science literacy suggests further attitudes about the state of the world, one's responsibility for its well-being and one's sense of empowerment to make a difference. These attitudes may be important measures of science literacy, as described in the case of [[ocean literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cudaback|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promoting and measuring==
Proponents of scientific literacy tend to focus on what is learned by the time a student graduates from high school. Science literacy has always been an important element of the standards movement in education. All science literacy documents have been drafted with the explicit intent of influencing educational standards, as a means to drive curriculum, teaching, assessment, and ultimately, learning nationwide.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Programs to promote scientific literacy among students abound, including several programs sponsored by technology companies, as well as quiz bowls and science fairs. A partial list of such programs includes the [[Global Challenge Award]], the [[National Ocean Sciences Bowl]] and Action Bioscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|AIBS|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations have attempted to compare the scientific literacy of adults in different countries.  The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] found that scientific literacy in the United States is not measurably different from the OECD average.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NCES|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science News reports "The new U.S. rate, based on questionnaires administered in 2008, is seven percentage points behind Sweden, the only European nation to exceed the Americans.  The U.S. figure is slightly higher than that for Denmark, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands. And it’s double the 2005 rate in the United Kingdom (and the collective rate for the European Union)." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Science News|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University educators are attempting to develop reliable instruments to measure scientific literacy, and the use of [[Concept inventory|concept inventories]] is increasing in the fields of physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klymkowsky|Underwood|Garvin-Doxas|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and earth science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikispaces|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Libarkin|Ward|Andwerson|Kortemeyer|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Serafina Astafieva c. 1890s.jpg|thumbnail|Serafina Astafieva, c. 1890s]]
'''Serafina Astafieva''' (Russian: Серафима Александровна Астафьева; 1876 &amp;ndash; 13 September 1934) was a Russian dancer and ballet teacher.&lt;ref name=OX&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Dance'' (2004) [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Astafieva was a pupil at the [[Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre]] School and in 1895 graduated from the [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet|Mariinsky Ballet School]]. In 1896 she married [[Jozef Kshessinsky]] a famous [[character dancer]]. From 1909-1911 Astafieva performed with [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]]. After retiring from performing she opened the Russian Dancing Academy at [[The Pheasantry]] on [[King's Road]] in [[Chelsea, London]]. Her pupils included [[Anton Dolin]], [[Margot Fonteyn]],&lt;ref name=OX/&gt; [[Alicia Markova]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/03/arts/dance/03markova.html Alicia Markova, Ballerina Known for Giselle, Dies at 94] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hermione Darnborough]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dancing Times'', July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[blue plaque]] unveiled in 1968 commemorates Astafieva at 152 [[King's Road]] in Chelsea.&lt;ref name='EngHet'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/astafieva-princess-seraphine-1876-1934|title=ASTAFIEVA, PRINCESS SERAPHINE (1876-1934)|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is referenced as "Grishkin" in T. S. Eliot's poem ''[[Whispers of Immortality]]''.

A tactical decision game is a [[decision game]] that puts students in the role of the commander of a tactical unit who is faced with a challenging problem.  While most tactical decision games depict problems faced by the commanders of military units, &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The tactical decision game is known by a variety of names.  These include ''map problem'', ''tactical problem'', ''one-step [[Military simulation|war game]]'', and ''tactical decision exercise''.

Like other types of decision games, tactical decision games may either be historical or fictional.  If the scenario is based entirely upon a reliable historical narrative, a tactical decision game is also a ''decision-forcing case''.  (Such an exercise may also be called an ''historical map problem''.)  However, if any of the elements in the scenario of a tactical decision game is fictional, then the exercise is a kind of ''fictional decision game''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Tactical Decision Games Before 1800==

In Chapter 14 of ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] tells the story of the Greek general [[Philopoemon]], who made extensive use of tactical decision games.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Philopoemon, Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: “If the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to re-treat, how ought we to set about it? If they should retreat, how ought we to pursue?” And he would set forth to them, as he went, all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected circumstances that he could deal with.”

==Tactical Decision Games in Prussia and Germany==

[[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]], who served as chief of the [[Prussian General Staff]] from 1857 to 1888, made extensive use of tactical decision games to train his subordinates and inform contingency planning.  Called "tactical assignments" (''taktische Aufgaben''), these problems employed fictional scenarios in which ideal units were employed on actual terrain.  Some of these games were gathered into a book, ''Moltkes taktische Aufgaben aus den Jahren 1858 bis 1882'', which was published in 1892 as the second volume of a multi-volume set of Moltke's collected works.  Two years later, an English translation of this book came out under the title ''Moltke's Tactical Problems from 1858 to 1882''.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| url=https://archive.org/details/moltkestactical00armegoog 
| postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sharp contrast to Moltke's tactical decision games, which had no direct connection to actual engagements, those published by [[Julius von Verdy du Vernois]] often made explicit use of real-world events.  The problems contained in the first volume of Verdy's ''Kriegsgeschichtliche Studien nach der applikatorischen Methode'' (''Military Historical Studies by means of the Applicatory Method'') were all based on incidents of the battle that took place between Austrian and Italian forces on 24 June 1866. However, in an attempt to make the games more useful to German officers, he replaced the actual (Austrian and Italian) formations engaged in the battle with an imaginary German infantry division, thereby converting what would have been decision-forcing cases into fictional decision games.  (Originally published in 1876, this work was later translated into English as ''A Tactical Study Based on the Battle of [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Custozza]]''.)

In his earlier (and more famous) work, the four volume ''Studien über Truppen-Führung''), Verdy also used historical events as the starting point for his games.  However, in addition to fictionalizing orders of battle, he also changed the outcomes of particular engagements.  (The word [[Truppenführung | ''Truppen-Führung'']], which is often translated as "troop leading" or "the leading of troops",  refers to the art of handling of combined arms formations:  infantry divisions, cavalry divisions, and army corps.)

==Tactical Decision Games in the United States Armed Forces==

In 1975, the Simulation Center of the [[9th Infantry Division (United States) | 9th Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] published a training package for junior leaders called ''What Now, Lieutenant?''.  Designed to be used in conjunction with a war game of the same name, this package consisted of scenarios that described situations faced by the commanders of battalions, companies, and platoons.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| last= United States Army, 9th Infantry Division 
| year=1975 
| title=What Now, Lieutenant?
| publisher=9th Infantry Division, Fort Lewis, Washington   
| postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, the [[United States Marine Corps Training and Education Command |Education Center]] of the United States [[Marine Corps Combat Development Command|Marine Corps Development and Education Command]] used this package as the starting point for a series of three "instructional pamphlets": ''Tactical Problems for Battalion Commanders'', ''Tactical Problems for Platoon Leaders/Company Commanders'', and ''Tactical Problems for Squad Leaders''.  In addition to twelve problems taken from ''What Now, Lieutenant?'', the ''Tactical Problems ...'' series contained sixteen games that were written expressly for the series by Chief Warrant Officer Bryan N. Lavender, USMC.

Like the scenarios in ''What Now, Lieutenant?'', the games in the ''Tactical Problems ...'' series were based them on descriptions of actual engagements that took place between 1914 and 1953.  Some of these were first-hand accounts written by [[S.L.A. Marshall]], [[Erwin Rommel]],and [[Friedrich von Mellenthin]].  Others were secondary works composed by military historians.) Regardless of the actual events that inspired them, all of the problems were modified to reflect the organization and equipment of the 1980s.  Thus, none of these historically-inspired games can be classified as [[case method | decision-forcing cases]].)

[[File:Angers - Campus Saint-Serge.jpg|The Saint-Serge Campus|thumb]]
The '''University of Angers''' ({{lang-fr|Université d'Angers}}) is an institution of higher education in the town of [[Angers]] in western France.
It began as the School of Angers in the 11th Century and became a university in 1337. 
In 1432, the Faculties of Medicine, Arts, and Theology were added to the Faculty of Law.
The university was closed in 1793 during the [[French Revolution]] and was reestablished in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-angers.fr/fr/universite/historique.html "History of the University of Angers (in French)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-revolutionary institution is sometimes looked upon as the precedent institution of the [[Catholic University of the West]], though, as both popes and kings have granted charters to the old University of Angers, it is not a clear predecessor to either of the current Universities in Angers.
