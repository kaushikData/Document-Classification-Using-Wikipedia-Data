[[File:Sh 1921 kangaroos.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Tour match photo taken at Barrow.]]The '''1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain''' was the third ever [[Kangaroo tour]]. Again an [[Australasia rugby league team|Australasian side]] rather than an [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian team]] alone (although the 28-man squad featured only one New Zealander) travelled to Great Britain to contest [[The Ashes (rugby league)|the Ashes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The tour took place during the [[1921–22 Northern Rugby Football Union season]] and also featured matches against several of the clubs in that competition as well as other representative teams. The tour also involved some degree of player misbehaviour, with one young footballer almost sent home from [[San Francisco]] because of all the broken glasses following a drinking session on board the team′s ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Touring squad==
During 1921 the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand side]] toured Australia, playing matches against [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] and [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]], which served as selection trials for the upcoming 'Australasian' team's tour, for which only one New Zealander, [[Bert Laing]], selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Kangaroos' winning streak came to an end when they played against England. Australasia led 5-3 at the break and the match seemed to be theirs when Frank Burge scored a late try, but it was disallowed by referee Frank Renton. Thus, a sole second-half try from the British close to full-time was enough for them to win it.

In the second Test the scores were 2-all at half-time, but after that the Australian backline of Horder, Carstairs, Vest and Blinkhorn cut loose. The Kangaroos scored 4 tries to nil, the win setting up the third and final Test as the Ashes decider. This was also the last Test in the international career of Sandy Pearce and made him the oldest ever Kangaroo.

The Kangaroos played sixteen more tour matches between the second and third Tests:

The '''[[Bahamas]]''' competed in the [[Summer Olympic Games]] for the first time at the '''[[1952 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Helsinki]], Finland. Only seven men went to [[Helsinki]] to compete in the sailing, all seven were affiliated with [[Nassau Yacht Club]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.nassauyachtclub.org/about/about.html |title=About |publisher=Nassau Yacht Club |accessdate=2 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710175857/http://www.nassauyachtclub.org/about/about.html |archivedate=10 July 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Durward Knowles]] and [[Sloane Farrington]] had both competed at the [[Sailing at the 1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Olympics]] for [[Great Britain at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]], due to the [[Bahamas]] not being recognised by the [[IOC]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://starclass.org/artman/publish/article_295.shtml|title=Sir Duward Knowles|publisher=starclass.org|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Busch Memorial Stadium''', also known as '''Busch Stadium II''', was a multi-purpose sports facility in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], that operated for 40 years, from [[1966 St. Louis Cardinals season|1966]] through [[2005 St. Louis Cardinals season|2005]].&lt;ref name=semcwtco&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O58fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wNUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1785%2C5779330 |newspaper=Southeast Missourian |location=Cape Girardeau |agency=Associated Press |last=Newberry |first=Paul |title=Cardinals want to close out old home with title |date=October 13, 2005 |page=4B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium served as the home of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[National League]] [[baseball]] team for its entire operating existence, while also serving as home to the [[National Football League]]'s [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|Cardinals]] team for 22 seasons, from [[1966 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1966]] through [[1987 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1987]], as well as the [[St. Louis Rams]] during part of the [[1995 St. Louis Rams season|1995]] season. It opened four days after the last baseball game was played at [[Sportsman's Park]] (which had also been known since 1953 as '''Busch Stadium''').

The stadium was designed by [[Sverdrup &amp; Parcel]] and built by [[Bilfinger Berger|Grün &amp; Bilfinger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bilfingerberger.com/C1257130005050D5/vwContentByKey/W26U3AX8814LUNADE/$FILE/bb_historie_en.html Bilfinger Berger Corporate history animation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324054618/http://www.bilfingerberger.com/C1257130005050D5/vwContentByKey/W26U3AX8814LUNADE/%24FILE/bb_historie_en.html |date=2010-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Durell Stone]] designed the roof, a 96-arch "Crown of Arches".&lt;ref&gt;[http://jbauer.com/arches.pdf Save the Arches – jbauer.com – Retrieved January 22, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227095102/http://jbauer.com/arches.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown echoed the [[Gateway Arch]], which had been completed only a year before Busch Stadium opened. It was one of the first multipurpose "[[Cookie-cutter stadium|cookie-cutter]]" facilities built in the United States, popular from the early 1960s through the early 1980s.

Its final event was the sixth game of the [[2005 National League Championship Series|2005 NLCS]] on October 19.&lt;ref name=bscidfn&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Pp8fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wNUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4304%2C7330247 |newspaper=Southeast Missourian |location=Cape Girardeau |agency=Associated Press |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Mike |title=Busch stadium closes in disappointing fashion |date=October 20, 2005 |page=1B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was demolished by [[wrecking ball]] in late 2005 and part of its former footprint is occupied by its replacement stadium—the new [[Busch Stadium]] (a.k.a. '''Busch Stadium III'''), located just south.

==History==

===Construction===
The baseball Cardinals had played at [[Sportsman's Park]] since {{baseball year|1920}}.  They originally were tenants of the [[St. Louis Browns]] of the [[American League]].  Although the Cardinals had long since passed the Browns as St. Louis' favorite team, they had wanted to get a stadium of their own as early as 1920.

In 1958, Charles Farris, the city's head of development, proposed a new stadium downtown as the core of a plan to revive a 31-block area of the business district. The original design of the stadium had called for a baseball-only format, but the design was altered to accommodate the football Cardinals, who had moved in from Chicago after the [[1959 Chicago Cardinals season|1959]] season and shared Sportsman's Park/Busch Stadium with the baseball Cardinals.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} With support from the [[St. Louis Regional Chamber|local Chamber of Commerce]], the Civic Center Redevelopment Corporation was established in September 1959; it was given power of [[eminent domain]], which it used to condemn [[Chinatown, St. Louis|the city's small Chinatown]], the Grand Theater (a [[strip club]]), and various [[warehouse]]s and [[flophouse]]s.&lt;ref name="alookback"/&gt;

Groundbreaking occurred on May 25, 1964,&lt;ref name=fcruoa/&gt; and construction took just under two years. The plan also included parking garages, a hotel (a [[Stouffer Hotels|Stouffer's hotel]]), and office buildings.&lt;ref name="alookback"/&gt; A few years later, it also became the new home of the Spanish Pavilion from the [[1964 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ksdk.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=202891|title=May 24, 1969: Spanish International Pavilion Moves to St. Louis|work=[[KSDK]]|location=St. Louis|date=May 25, 2010|first=Kevin|last=Held|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stadium opened on May 12, [[1966 St. Louis Cardinals season|1966]], one month into the baseball season, as ''Civic Center Busch Memorial Stadium.'' However, the "Civic Center" part was almost never used, and most people called it simply ''Busch Memorial Stadium.''

===Subsequent years===
The stadium's grass was replaced with [[AstroTurf]] in 1970,&lt;ref name=mxflg&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S0xSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AHwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5711%2C3852063 |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |agency=Associated Press |title=Mixed feeling on Astroturf in St. Louis |date=April 14, 1970 |page=2-C }}&lt;/ref&gt; in part because St. Louis' notoriously hot summers made it difficult to keep the grass alive. The Cardinals retained the traditional dirt skin infield for eight seasons, then converted to [[slide (baseball)|sliding]] pits when the surface was replaced for the [[1978 St. Louis Cardinals season|1978]] baseball season.&lt;ref name=bswgartf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nsYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=f2cEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3356%2C2371927 |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |agency=Associated Press |title=Busch Stadium will get artificial turf |date=December 20, 1977 |page=2-C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Storied"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Curt|authorlink=Curt Smith (author)|title=Storied Stadiums|year=2001|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|location=New York City|isbn=0-7867-1187-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; With artificial turf, the playing conditions at Busch Stadium were among the hottest in baseball,&lt;ref name=holdhte&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LakcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OWMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5646%2C2336703 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Press |title=Busch Stadium holds the heat |last=Hertzel |first=Bob |date=August 3, 1987 |page=D2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with temperatures well above the local official readings.&lt;ref name=htfoot&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Q25IAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PlcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3473%2C3717423 |newspaper=St. Petersburg Independent |agency=Associated Press |title=Turf gives Cards hotfoot |date=June 16, 1970 |page=1-C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bahoft&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nIgfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lcsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3302%2C390045 |newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal |agency=Associated Press |title=Busch Astroturf hits 152 degrees |date=July 2, 1970 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Anheuser-Busch bought the stadium in 1981 for $53 million and renamed it simply '''Busch Stadium'''; the price included the parking garages.&lt;ref name="alookback"/&gt;
[[Image:Busch Stadium new construction.jpg|thumb|245px|New &amp; old Busch Stadiums in August 2005]]
Over the years the grounds became home to bronze statues of [[Stan Musial]], [[Enos Slaughter]], [[Dizzy Dean]], [[Rogers Hornsby]], [[Red Schoendienst]], [[Lou Brock]], [[Bob Gibson]], [[Cool Papa Bell|James "Cool Papa" Bell]], [[George Sisler]], [[Jack Buck]], and [[Ozzie Smith]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Following Busch's last 1995 event&amp;mdash;the Rams' October 22 game prior to the opening of the now-[[Dome at America's Center]]&amp;mdash;the Cardinals retrofitted it into a baseball-only stadium. A large section of the upper deck outfield seats was closed, replaced with a hand-operated scoreboard and flags commemorating the Cardinals' retired numbers and World Series championships. The stadium's original natural grass field was restored, and the outfield walls were repainted green from their original blue.&lt;ref name=bsfogr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sMQfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=h9gEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4456%2C5874912 |newspaper=Southeast Missourian |location=Cape Girardeau |agency=Associated Press |title=Busch Stadium rolls out the grass |date=February 14, 1996 |page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demolition===
[[Image:Old Busch Destroyed.jpg|thumb|245px|alt=Old Busch Destroyed.|Busch Stadium II demolition in late 2005]]
Busch Memorial Stadium was originally slated to be [[Building implosion|imploded]] like most modern-day stadium [[demolition]]s to be able to finish construction on the new stadium in time for the [[2006 St. Louis Cardinals season|2006]] season. Due to fear of damaging the nearby [[Metro Transit (St. Louis)|Metro]] subway and stadium station, it was decided to tear down the stadium with a [[wrecking ball]], piece-by-piece, over a period of a few weeks.

Demolition of the stadium began at 3:07&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|CST]] on November 7 and was completed shortly after midnight on December 8, 2005.

Part of the footprint of the old stadium is now occupied by the outfield of the current stadium.  The Cardinals had planned to build [[St. Louis Ballpark Village|Ballpark Village]] on the site of the stadium ($320 million for the first phase).  It was to consist of boutiques and restaurants, condominium apartments anchored by the new headquarters of [[Centene Corporation]] — all to be built in time for the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2009]].

None of the construction had occurred until groundbreaking ceremonies on February 8, 2013, and locals derisively referred to its rain soaked unfinished status before that date as "Lake DeWitt"—after Cardinal President [[William DeWitt, Jr.]]  The Cardinals in March 2009 announced the site would be used for a softball field and parking during the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/politics/story/419072777E45A64B8625757E000E7DA1?OpenDocument Ballpark Village site to become softball field, parking lot for now] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422171246/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/politics/story/419072777E45A64B8625757E000E7DA1?OpenDocument |date=April 22, 2009 }} ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' March 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

===Football===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Busch Stadium was also the home of the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]] of the [[National Football League]] for 22 seasons, from [[1966 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1966]] through [[1987 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1987]].  The stadium was one of the smaller facilities in the NFL, never seating more than 60,000.  After efforts to get a larger stadium failed, owner [[Bill Bidwill]] moved the team to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] after the 1987 season.

The football Cardinals never hosted a playoff game during their 28 seasons in St. Louis. The "Gridbirds" made only three playoff appearances during that stretch, losing on the road against the [[1974 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] in [[1974–75 NFL playoffs|1974]], [[1975 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] in [[1975–76 NFL playoffs|1975]], and [[1982 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] in [[1982–83 NFL playoffs|1982]]. They did win the [[Third place playoff|third place]] [[Playoff Bowl]] after the [[1964 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1964]] season, upsetting [[Vince Lombardi]]'s [[1964 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] 31–24 at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] in [[Miami]].

Busch Stadium was also briefly the home of the [[1995 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], who relocated from [[Anaheim Stadium]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. Completion of their new home, the new and nearby Trans World Dome (later renamed the [[Dome at America's Center]]) was delayed, so the Rams played the first half of the [[1995 St. Louis Rams season|1995]] season at Busch Stadium, with four home games, the last on October 22. The new indoor venue hosted its first NFL game on November 12, 1995.

In between the Cardinals' and the Rams' eras, the stadium hosted two NFL exhibition games, between the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[New England Patriots]] in 1989, and the [[New York Jets]] and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in 1991.

===Baseball===

In its opening year, Busch Stadium hosted the [[1966 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], a 2–1 [[National League]] victory in 10 innings, mostly remembered for the humidity and {{convert|105|F}} temperatures.  The stadium hosted [[World Series]] games in six different seasons: {{wsy|1967}}, {{wsy|1968}}, {{wsy|1982}}, {{wsy|1985}}, {{wsy|1987}}, and {{wsy|2004}}. The Cardinals won the World Series in [[1967 St. Louis Cardinals season|1967]] and [[1982 St. Louis Cardinals season|1982]] while playing in the stadium (the seventh game of the 1982 Series was won at Busch). The 1968 and 2004 World Series were clinched in Busch Stadium by visitors: the [[1968 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] in the seventh game and the [[2004 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] in a four-game sweep, respectively.

The stadium was also the site of [[Mark McGwire]]'s historic 62nd home run of the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|1998]] season that broke [[Roger Maris]]' single-season record, and also of McGwire's 70th of that season, for a record which lasted until [[Barry Bonds]] surpassed it in 2001. The dimensions in center and the power alleys had been altered from time to time over the years. Initially the park was very favorable to pitchers, with spacious outfield dimensions. Consequently, its design (as well as the Astroturf surface) was favorable to the Cardinals' style of play for most of the time from the 1960s through the 1990s, which emphasized good baserunning and extra-base hits. Later changes attempted to make the outfield better balanced between pitching and power hitting.&lt;ref name="Storied"/&gt;

Before the 1996 season, the stadium was retrofitted to become a baseball-only stadium.  Part of the top deck in center field was permanently closed, and in 1997, flags were put in place to honor the team's retired numbers and pennants.&lt;ref name=cibst&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eA4pAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U9YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3614%2C2631439 |newspaper=Southeast Missourian |location=Cape Girardeau |agency=Associated Press |title=Cards inject Busch Stadium with second dose of tradition |date=December 13, 1996 |page=3B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before then, the stadium had come under less scorn from baseball purists than other cookie-cutter stadiums built during the same era, partly because the "crown of arches" gave it a more traditional look than its cousins.&lt;ref name="Storied"/&gt;

The baseball diamond was oriented [[Points of the compass#32 cardinal points|southeast by east]] (home to center field); the new stadium is aligned east-northeast, the recommended orientation.&lt;ref name=mlbobj&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/objectives_1.jsp |publisher=Major League Baseball |title=Objectives of the Game – rule 1.04 |accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural Sports Complex Nika Stadium''' is a football stadium in the city of [[Oleksandria]], [[Ukraine]]. The stadium was rebuilt in 1998 in place of Shakhtar Stadium&lt;ref name="club"/&gt; under a new name Nika.

The stadium is the home ground of [[Ukrainian Premier League]] club [[PFC Oleksandria]] and has a capacity of 7,000 spectators.

Before 1992 as Shakhtar Stadium, it was a home ground of another football club Shakhtar Oleksandriya. FC Oleksandriya that in 1991-2003 was known as FC Polihraftekhnika played about 4 games in the [[1992 Ukrainian First League]] before it was forced to move to its newly built Olimp Stadium (25 May 1991&lt;ref name="club"/&gt;). After Shakhtar Oleksandriya became defunct in 1990s, the stadium was rebuilt into the Cultural Sports Complex "Nika" and reopened in 1998. In 1998 Polihraftekhnika returned to the stadium.

Between 2004&amp;ndash;2006 [[FC Krystal Oleksandria|MFK Oleksandria]] played their home games also at the stadium.

Seventy percent of the seating is under cover.&lt;ref name="club"/&gt; The main stadium has administration offices as well as a conference hall.&lt;ref name="club"/&gt;

'''''Champion''''' is a 1949 American  [[film noir]] drama sport film based on a short story by [[Ring Lardner]]. It recounts the struggles of [[boxing|boxer]] "Midge" Kelly fighting his own demons while working to achieve success in the [[boxing ring]]. The drama was directed by [[Mark Robson]], with [[cinematography]] by [[Franz Planer]].  The drama features [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Marilyn Maxwell]], and [[Arthur Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0041239|title=Champion}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film won an [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing]] and gained five other nominations as well, including a [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Douglas.

Several clips from the film were used in Douglas' 1999 film ''[[Diamonds (1999 film)|Diamonds]]'' to illustrate his character's career as a boxer.

==Plot==
The drama charts the story of Midge Kelly ([[Kirk Douglas]]), a boxer who pushes himself to the top of his game by knocking out opponents and back-stabbing his friends. He has no qualms about deceiving the various females he encounters and he eventually double-crosses Tommy Haley ([[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]]), the manager who found him and helped pave his road to fame.

Michael "Midge" Kelly and his brother Connie Kelly ([[Arthur Kennedy]]) are crossing America by thumb and freight cars from [[Chicago]] to [[California]], where they have bought a share in a restaurant. Along the way, they hitch a lift from a car carrying a top boxer, Johnny Dunne, and his girlfriend Grace Diamond ([[Marilyn Maxwell]]). They are driven to Kansas City where Dunne is fighting another contender that night.

Midge needs money and is offered a fight on the under-card for $35. After taking a beating, the promoter only pays him $10, claiming the remainder as "management and facility fees". The fight brings him to the attention of fight trainer Tommy Haley, who tells him to come to his gym in Los Angeles if he ever needs a break. Kelly is not interested.

Once they reach Los Angeles, however, they discover they have been conned in the restaurant deal. The brothers need to secure jobs waiting tables and washing dishes. Both strike up a relationship with the owner's daughter, Emma ([[Ruth Roman]]). When Midge Kelly is discovered with her, they are forced to marry by her outraged father.

After the [[shotgun wedding]], Kelly abandons his new wife and flees with his brother. They head to the gym run by Haley.

Kelly enters his new field with a single-minded devotion. He defeats a number of local fighters, begins touring the country and is soon ranked as a contender. He is matched with Johnny Dunne, who is in line for a championship fight. Organized crime figures lean on Kelly to throw the match, guaranteeing him a legitimate shot at the title the following year if he complies. Kelly agrees, but then goes back on his word and destroys the complacent Dunne in a single round.

Seeing which way the wind is blowing, Grace Diamond now attaches herself to Kelly. She persuades him to abandon his manager Haley and take on the management of Jerome Harris, an extremely wealthy and influential figure in the fight game with criminal ties. Realizing this is the only way he will get a shot at the title, Kelly agrees. His brother is so disgusted that he walks out. He reconnects with Midge's abandoned wife and convinces her to return to Chicago with him to help care for his aged and ailing mother.

Kelly takes the title and becomes a popular fan favorite because of his rise from humble beginnings. He soon becomes involved with the wife of his new manager, Palmer Harris, a sculptor. She falls in love with him and persuades Kelly to ask her husband for a divorce. Harris refuses and instead offers Kelly a large sum of money if he relinquishes his wife. Kelly agrees, leaving Palmer brokenhearted.

He has been fighting a number of second-rate challengers, but now he has agreed to fight Dunne, who has been making a comeback. Dunne is in good shape and Kelly quickly realizes he is going to lose unless he gets in top shape. He hires back his old manager, and Connie and Emma come back into the camp as well. Connie and Emma are now contemplating marriage, although Emma is still legally married to Midge. As they are breaking camp, Midge rapes Emma, just to show he can.

Kelly fights Dunne in the sporting event of the year. He knocks down the challenger in the first round. Dunne manages to get up and the balance of the fight shifts in his direction. He starts pounding Kelly, pummeling his face. Kelly's manager tries to throw in the towel, but Midge refuses and fights on, taking more punishment. After seeing Grace in the audience, Kelly, now enraged, rallies in the final round and knocks out Dunne. But he is seriously injured and dies in his locker room of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].

After delivering a favorable, but backhanded, [[eulogy]] to a reporter, Connie and Emma walk off into the darkness, now free to move forward with their lives.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
When the film was released, [[Bosley Crowther]], the film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', believed the drama was not exactly faithful to the original Lardner story, which had a very hard-edge.  Still, he gave the boxing drama a positive review, and wrote, "However, Director Mark Robson has covered up story weaknesses with a wealth of pictorial interests and exciting action of a graphic, colorful sort. His scenes in training gymnasiums, managers' offices and, of course, the big fight rings are strongly atmospheric and physically intense. Except that the fighting is more furious than one can credit, it is virtually all right. As the hero and "Champion", Kirk Douglas does a good, aggressive job, with a slight inclination to over-eagerness at times, which might amuse an old fight fan. Arthur Kennedy is dour as his crippled brother who distrusts the slaughterous sport, and Marilyn Maxwell, Ruth Roman and Lola Albright are attractive as the "champ's" various girls. Paul Stewart is most convincing as a quiet, hard-bitten manager. If one hasn't already seen the recently memorable "[[Body and Soul (1947 film)|Body and Soul]]" which might have served as a model for "Champion", this is a stinging fight film to see. If one has seen that other, this will look a little pale."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0DE0D8133CE23BBC4952DFB2668382659EDE Crowther, Bosley]. ''The New York Times'', film review, "Kirk Douglas Plays the Hero in 'Champion,' Film of Ring Lardner's Fight Story", April 11, 1949. Last accessed: December 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine gave the picture a good review and also noted the difference between the screenplay and the original story.  They wrote, "Adapted from a Ring Lardner short story of the same title, ''Champion'' is a stark, realistic study of the boxing rackets and the degeneracy of a prizefighter. Fight scenes, under Franz Planer's camera, have realism and impact. Unrelenting pace is set by the opening sequence. Cast, under Mark Robson's tight direction, is fine. Kirk Douglas is the boxer and he makes the character live. Second honors go jointly to Arthur Kennedy, the fighter's crippled brother, and Paul Stewart as the knowing manager."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117789818.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;query=Champion+robson ''Variety'']. Film review, April 11, 1949. Last accessed: December 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 92% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on thirteen reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1003857-champion/ ''Champion''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Last accessed: November 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

Ben ([[Kurt Russell]]), a horse trainer who takes his work very seriously, neglects his precocious daughter while he pours his heart into the care of the horses that he trains.

Determined to make good on her father's overdue promise, Cale ([[Dakota Fanning]]) prods him to take her along to work and succeeds. One morning, a horse named Soñador falls during a race, injuring herself so badly that Ben's boss, Palmer, demands the horse be put down. Having Cale along, Ben instead strikes a bargain with Palmer and becomes the owner of the wounded horse. With no job and facing foreclosure on his property, he decides to breed Soñador.

Cale, having fallen in love at first sight with Soñador, begins to sneak out to the barn at night to see her. She also sneaks over to see her grandfather, 'Pop', Ben's dad ([[Kris Kristofferson]]), who loves teaching his granddaughter about horses.

They go to another farm to pick out a stallion to breed with Soñador, but the stud fee is too high. Ben's father gives Ben some money to use to breed, and Ben reluctantly takes it. But before they can breed, the vet tests Soñador and finds out she is unable to have a foal.

After, Cale hears her father tell her mother, Lilly ([[Elisabeth Shue]]), that Soñador has ruined them because she cannot have a foal. Lily responds that Soñador is the best thing that has ever happened to them, alluding to the fact that Ben is finally spending much-needed time with Cale. Frustrated, Ben says that if Cale wasn't there the day when Soñador was hurt, he would have let her be put down.

Hurt after hearing the conversation, Cale sets out to run away and saddles Soñador. Not knowing of Cale's plan, Ben enters the barn. The door slams behind him, and a startled Soñador bolts out of the barn with Cale hanging on for dear life. Ben scrambles to his truck and sets out after them.

This incident begins to cement the newly forming bond between father and daughter. They realize that Soñador is very fast and decide to race her. Unfortunately, after the race she is claimed, and Cale is angry at her father for entering the horse in a claiming race.

At a parent-teacher night, Ben reads a story that Cale wrote about a king and his horse, and he realizes how much their family needs Soñador. He buys her back with money from his father. 
Cale decides to race Soñador in the Breeders’ Cup Classic, with Manny, Ben's colleague, as the jockey. They train together and get into the race, which they win.

*[[Kurt Russell]] as Benjamin "Ben" Crane
*[[Dakota Fanning]] as Cale Crane
*[[Kris Kristofferson]] as Pop Crane
*[[Elisabeth Shue]] as Lillian "Lilly" Crane
*[[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]] as Everett Palmer

==Production==

The movie is loosely inspired by the story of the mare [[Mariah's Storm]]. She was a promising filly who was being pointed towards the [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies]] in 1993 but then broke her cannon bone (the incident is mentioned in the film by Sonador's [[veterinarian]]). She recovered and later won some [[graded stakes race]]s. She started in the 1995 [[Breeders' Cup Distaff]] and finished ninth. She was owned by [[Thunderhead Farms]] and trained by Don Von Hemel. She is now known mostly for being the dam of [[Giant's Causeway (horse)|Giant's Causeway]]. In the movie, when Cale and Ben go to Ashford Stud to check out the studs, the stallions they are naming, such as Fusaichi Pegasus, Giant's Causeway, Mariah's Storm, Johannesburg and Grand Slam, are real horses who actually stand at Ashford. However, the actual stallions were not used in filming. Stand-ins were placed in their stalls instead. In the scene where Sonya is considered for the Breeder's Cup, Prince Sadir says that his horse "Rapid Cat is sired by Storm Cat, the best sire in the world." Coincidentally, Mariah's Storm (on whom Sonya is based) was bred to Storm Cat.

While doing research in Kentucky, the director/writer came upon a vet who told him about a racehorse who miraculously made a comeback after a serious injury, and he loosely based the script on this story. Before being picked up by DreamWorks, the script was presented to Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros, but both declined. Director John Gatins was told that if he could get Dakota Fanning in the lead role his movie would get a green-light. He went to see Fanning's agent and finally got the young actress to sign on. The role of Cale Crane was originally written for a boy, and the role was changed specifically so that Dakota Fanning could play it. The first script that was sent to Fanning actually had the word "boy" in the character description.

To produce the soundtrack, an advance showing of this film was shown to a number of recording artists, who were then asked to submit ideas for theme songs. [[Bethany Dillon]]'s song "Dreamer" was chosen out of all the submissions. After the movie, Kurt Russell bought Dakota Fanning a real [[Palomino horse]], whom she named Goldie.

==Release==
The film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 10, 2005 and released theatrically on October 21, 2005 by [[DreamWorks Pictures]]. It was released on VHS and DVD on March 21, 2006; it was the last Dreamworks film released on VHS.

==Location==
Its location is northwest of the city center in the subdivision of Queimada (or Queimada Guincho) at the foot of [[Monte Velha]] (part of Mount Fogo).

==History==
The stadium is the island's second to be built, around the late 20th century.  Around 1990, when the first two clubs became registered, the stadium which was known as '''Estádio dos Mosteiros''' became operated by the regional association.  For the 2003 season, all of the regional first stage matches were played.

In 2003, when Cutelinho was the only club outside the municipality of São Filipe to win a championship title, three of the five [[2003 Cape Verdean Football Championships|national championship]] matches took place at the stadium and one playoff match which was the first leg that it became abandoned at the 90th minute with the score 0-2 due to regression towards the referee, Cutelinho was disqualified and kicked out of the championships .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kaapv03.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175427/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kaapv03.html |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium started improvements and renovations around 2008 and the newer one was opened on January 30, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criolosports.com/2010/01/estadio-municipal-dos-mosteiros.html|title=Estádio municipal dos Mosteiros inaugurado este sábado|trans-title=Mosteiros Municipal Stadium to Open on Saturday|newspaper=Criolosport|language=pt|date=29 January 2010|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the participants was Sidónio Monteiro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fogo.cv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2275|title=Sidónio Monteiro participa na inauguração do Estádio Municipal dos Mosteiros|trans-title=Sidónio Monteiro Took Part in the Opening of Mosteiros Municipal Stadium|newspaper=Fogo News|language=pt|date=29 January 2010|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For one season around 2010, all of its regional cup competitions were at the stadium.  For one season in 2013, the regional cup matches featuring clubs that were part of the Mosteiros Group played at the stadium.

In the 2014 season, regional Premier Division matches were played every Saturday as Cutelinho, Nô Pintcha and Grito Povo were in the same division. From 2015 to 2017, clubs at the Premier Division based in the municipality were played each Saturday at 16:00 while Second Division matches were played each Sunday.

For the 2017-18 season, its matches features the Eastern Group clubs that are based in the municipality, one of two, the other is [[Estádio Monte Pe Largo]] in [[Santa Catarina do Fogo]].

'''''Fire, Ice and Dynamite''''' ([[German language|German]] original title '''''Feuer, Eis und Dynamit''''') is a German feature length [[sports film]] directed by [[Willy Bogner, Jr.|Willy Bogner]] in 1990. It a sequel to ''[[Fire and Ice (1986 film)|Fire and Ice]]''. The screenplay was written by [[Tony Williamson]], based on an original story by Willy Bogner.

==Plot==

The plot functions primarily as link between the stunt action scenes which mainly deal with skiing like in ''Fire and Ice''. It also contains heavy [[product placement]] (for example, VW released a special edition of the Golf MK II named "Fire &amp; Ice" which featured some special equipment details like the seat covers being said to be designed by Bogner himself).

[[Roger Moore]] plays an entrepreneur who is in debt with many companies. After faking his death by apparent suicide by jumping out of a plane, his children and several companies participate in several sporting events (skiing, rafting, bobsled etc.) for his $135 million estate - winner takes all. Additionally, a family of villains tries to get to the money.

The movie contains a cameo by [[Steffi Graf]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DD103EF93AA35751C0A966958260|title= Graf Is Injured Skiing|last=Finn|first=Robin|date=February 9, 1990|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niki Lauda]], [[Buzz Aldrin]], [[Dennis Conner]] and [[Isaac Hayes]]

==DVD release==

[[Lions Gate]] has yet to release the film onto DVD.  A PAL DVD release under the German title does exist, however.
Prism Leisure released the film on DVD in 2002, on a 2 Disc/4 DVD disc compilation consisting of ''Merchant of Death'', ''Musketeers Forever'', ''Fire Ice &amp; Dynamite'' and ''Paradise Lost''.

==History==
[[File:Fukuoka_Dome_2008-1.jpg|thumb|300px|A Hawks game in 2008]]
Fukuoka Dome is the home stadium of [[Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks]] and, together with [[Hilton Hotel|Hilton]] Fukuoka Sea Hawk Hotel, is part of the Hawks Town entertainment complex.&lt;ref name="hawks" /&gt; It is located near [[Sawara-ku, Fukuoka|Momochi Beach]], about 15 minutes walk from [[Tōjinmachi Station|Tojinmachi]] [[Fukuoka City Subway|subway]] station.

In 2006, the stadium received an upgrade to its mono-color main scoreboard "Hawks Vision." Sharing the same nickname as its predecessor and measured at 10&amp;nbsp;m (32.76&amp;nbsp;ft) high and 53&amp;nbsp;m (173.86&amp;nbsp;ft) wide, it was one of the largest high-definition electronic scoreboards at the time, equivalent to a 2,123-inch wide-screen display. In 2010, with further addition of two 5.7&amp;nbsp;m (120.65&amp;nbsp;ft) x 33&amp;nbsp;m (108.27&amp;nbsp;ft) displays, the stadium boasted the largest total viewing area of HD display in all baseball stadia (total area 905.2sqm or 9,743.49sqft).&lt;ref name="sb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of largest video screens]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fukuoka Dome has hosted one game in each [[Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series]] since its creation, including the final game of the 2006 series, where Japan was swept for the first time in the history of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[[Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series|MLB completes sweep with walk-off]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the TV series ''[[Extreme Engineering]]'', Danny Forster makes a reference to the Fukuoka Dome, saying it was said to have a "floating" field. (An indoor baseball stadium in Japan which actually has a floating field is [[Sapporo Dome]], which also hosts [[football (soccer)|football]] games for [[Consadole Sapporo]], a [[J. League]] club. However, this stadium does not have such a field.) In 2009, the older [[AstroTurf]] field was replaced with the now more common [[FieldTurf]] brand surface to reduce injuries; the Hawks players had seen far more injuries than any other team in Japan.

==Concerts==
[[Michael Jackson]] performed at the stadium four times at his solo career. The first two times, Jackson performed two sold-out concerts during his ''[[Dangerous World Tour]]'', on September 10 &amp; 11, 1993, for a total audience of 70,000 fans (35,000 per show). The second and last two times were in 1996, during his subsequent tour, ''[[HIStory World Tour]]'', on December 26 and 28, also on two sold-out concerts for 80,000 people (40,000 fans per show).

[[Whitney Houston]] performed at the stadium on September 22, 1993 during [[The Bodyguard World Tour]].

[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] performed three times at the stadium. The shows happened on 7, 8 and 9 December 1993 during [[The Girlie Show World Tour]].

The stadium also hosted [[Frank Sinatra]]'s final public concerts on 19 and 20 December 1994.

The [[Rolling Stones]] played two concerts at the dome during their [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] on 22 and 23 March 1995.

[[Bon Jovi]] played a concert at the dome on May 13, 1995 during their [[These Days Tour]].

On September 18 and 19, 2000 the stadium hosted [[L'Arc~en~Ciel]] as part of their "TOUR 2000 REAL"

[[Super Junior]] performed his [[Super Show 6]] at the stadium on 20 December 2014 as part of their sixth world tour, with a sold-out crowd of 52,874 people.

The '''Gozo Stadium''' ({{lang-mt|Il-Grawnd t'Għawdex}}), formerly known as the '''Silver Jubilee Ground''', is the main stadium of the island of [[Gozo]], [[Malta]]. The Gozo Stadium, which is located in [[Xewkija]], seats only 1,644 people but its standing areas at each end of its main stand ensure that the stadium can hold up to approximately 3,800 people. Similar to Malta, the Gozo Stadium is the main venue of the local top division, the [[Gozo Football League First Division]], and the finals of all cups organised by the [[Gozo Football Association]] are generally held at the stadium. 

== History ==

=== Early years ===

The stadium was erected in 1936 and as a commemoration of the Silver Jubilee of [[King George V]], the stadium was named the Silver Jubilee Ground. The stadium, which originally comprised only what is now referred to as the Xewkija Stand, costed 819 pounds, 12 shillings and 3 pence to built. A number of amenities, namely a boundary wall around the ground, dressing rooms, toilets and a bar, were added two years later. 
 
In 1975, the stadium was expanded through the construction of an opposite stand, commonly referred to as the Xaghra Stand, and in 1995 the surface of the pitch was converted to [[grass|natural turf]] and the stadium was renamed to '''Gozo Stadium'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportinmalta.com/new-complex-at-the-gozo-stadium-inaugurated/&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the stadium was rather unique in Gozo as all other pitches had sandy surfaces. The sandy surfaces have almost all gone now but the fact that these have been replaced with synthetic surf surfaces ensures that Gozo Stadium's distinction in being the only stadium in Gozo having a natural turf pitch remains intact to this day.  

=== Recent years ===

In January 2007, the stadium was illuminated by floodlights for the first time as the erection of a floodlight at each corner ensured that the '''Gozo Stadium''' could also host football matches after dawn as well. Three years after, and in anticipation of Gozo's hosting of the [[VIVA World Cup]], the stadium was subject to another investment.&lt;ref&gt;http://gozonews.com/12379/the-latest-upgrades-on-gozo-stadium-well-underway/&lt;/ref&gt;. The project, which costed around €340k entailed the construction of a complex behind one of the goals. The complex includes offices, four dressing rooms, two rooms for the use of referees, new toilet facilities and a garage. In 2011, the stadium was improved through the laying of a new five-a-side pitch and the construction of a parking space catering for 75 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;http://gozonews.com/16187/new-5-a-side-sports-facilities-carpark-at-the-gozo-stadium/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2013, and with the UEFA European Under-17 Championship in the horizon, the Government allocated €500k to fund the improvement of football grounds around the island of Gozo&lt;ref&gt;http://gozonews.com/37091/e500000-allocated-for-gozo-football-ground-improvements/&lt;/ref&gt;. The Gozo Stadium was one of the beneficiaries as part of the budget was used to fund the development of further facilities at the Gozo Stadium, particularly a state-of-the art VIP Area at the enclosure.

== Description ==

The '''Gozo Stadium''' is located at Mgarr Road, the main road connecting [[Xewkija]] to [[Victoria, Gozo|Victoria]]. It comprises two stands on each side of the pitch. The enclosure, the larger of the two, is situated on Xewkija's side and, almost by default, is referred to as the Xewkija Side. The stand, which is sliced in two by the VIP Area, is all seated and covered under a roof. Moreover, a standing area together with a bar is located at the end of each side of the stand. Opposite to the Xewkija Side is the Xaghra Side. As suggestive by its name, it is located on Xaghra's side and aesthetically speaking the stand consists of a stand running alongside the pitch, with a bar located right at the middle. The Xaghra Side is not covered from the elements and is only opened when the stadium hosts important matches and hence hundreds are expected to turn up. Both stands are accessible from Mgarr Road.

== Events ==

===  UEFA European Under-17 Championship ===

The Gozo Stadium was one of the three stadiums used during the Maltese hosting of the [[2014 UEFA European Under-17 Championship]]. The stadium hosted 4 group matches in all. 

=== UEFA Regions' Cup ===

Aback of the [[Malta Football Association]]'s decision to have a [[Gozo|Gozitan side]] representing [[Malta]] during the [[2013 UEFA Regions' Cup|2013]], [[2015 UEFA Regions' Cup|2015]] and [[2017 UEFA Regions' Cup|2017]] editions of the [[UEFA Regions Cup]] and consequent to [[UEFA]]'s decision for Malta to host the group matches in which Gozo was drawn in all three editions, the Gozo Stadium also hosted the 9 matches played during the Intermediary Round of the three editions in question. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uefa.com/regionscup/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maltese Premier League ===

Up to 2011, Gozo was also used to be represented in the [[Maltese football league system]] by [[Gozo FC]]. The highest point of the club's history was its promotion to the [[Maltese Premier League]] by winning the 1998/1999 edition of the [[Maltese First Division]]. All Gozo FC's home matches during their only season in the highest echelon of the Maltese football were played at the Gozo Stadium.

=== 2010 Viva World Cup ===

The '''Gozo Stadium''' was one of the two venues to host the [[2010 Viva World Cup|2010]] edition of the [[Viva World Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;http://gozonews.com/13597/the-fourth-edition-of-the-viva-world-cup-kicks-off-in-gozo/&lt;/ref&gt;. Besides the opening ceremony, the stadium hosted five matches in all, namely three group stage matches, a semi-final and the final between [[Iraqi Kurdistan national football team|Iraqi Kurdistan]] and the eventual winners [[Padania national football team|Padania]].

'''Havelock Park''' ({{lang-si|හැව්ලොක් පාර්ක්}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in
[[Havelock Town]], [[Colombo]] [[Sri Lanka]].  It is one of the oldest grounds in the country. The sporting complex is located in Havelock Town and is bordered by Havelock Road, Park Road and Isipathana Mawatha.

==Early history==
Havelock Park was established in 1901 to honour Sir [[Arthur Havelock|Sir Arthur Elibank Havelock]] (1844–1908), who was the 17th [[Governors of British Ceylon|British Governor of Ceylon]] (1890–1895), by the [[Colombo Municipal Council]] (CMC). Havelock Park was originally {{convert|1.82|ha|abbr=on}} in area but in 1905 the CMC purchased an additional {{convert|2.41|ha|abbr=on}} for Rs 30,000. By 1907 [[Galle Face Green]], [[Viharamahadevi Park|Victoria Park]] (now known as Viharamahadevi Park) and the Havelock Town Park were adjudged as being the major "green lungs" of Colombo.

==Sports==

During the early decades of the 19th Century, Havelock Park became the home of several sporting clubs, although one, the Havelock Golf Club, shifted to Buller’s Road (Bauddhaloka Mawatha) where the [[Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall]] now stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/010513/sports2.html|title=Golf started on the Galle Face Green|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|The Sunday Times]]|date=13 May 2001|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the northern end of Havelock Park is the public area named after the national hero, Captain [[Henry Pedris|Duenuge Edward Henry Pedris]] (1888–1915), was executed by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] officials for alleged incitement of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] [[riots]] in 1915, which were later proven false.

Adjacent to Pedris Park, is one of Sri Lanka’s oldest rugby clubs, the [[Havelock Sports Club]], which was established in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timeslanka.com/2014/09/12/havelocks-sports-club-to-celebrate-centenary-next-year/|title=Havelocks Sports Club to celebrate Centenary next year|newspaper=The Times of Sri Lanka|date=12 September 2014|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 September 1907 the first international [[rugby union]] match played in [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] was held at Havelock Park between the [[1907–08 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain|New Zealand All Blacks]] and an All Ceylon team. The grounds were renovated in July 2012 to celebrate the club's 97th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivalanka.com/newspage/328028ai-|title=Havelock Hurrah|publisher=Viva Lanka|date=30 July 2012|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Burgher Recreation Club]] (BRC) is also located on Havelock Park. The club originally known as the Bambalapitiya Sports Club was established in 1896 and in 1901 changed to Burgher Recreation Club when the club house was relocated to Havelock Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.dailymirror.lk/2006/05/27/sports/1.asp|title=P.M. toasts the Burghers|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)|Daily Mirror]]|last=Rahaman|first=T.B.|date=27 May 2006|accessdate=12 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150312140516/http://archives.dailymirror.lk/2006/05/27/sports/1.asp|archivedate=12 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the south-east corner is [[Colts Cricket Club Ground]], the home of [[Colts Cricket Club]] since 1971. The ground is a regular venue for [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches and also hosted many [[women's cricket]] matches. The Colts Cricket Club is a [[first-class cricket]] team that has won the [[Premier Trophy|Sri Lanka domestic league]] six times, the latest being the 2011-12 season.

A children’s playground was constructed in the south-west corner of the park in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ceylon Sessional Papers|publisher=Government Press|page=172|date=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cricket, and hence '''English amateur cricket''', probably began in England during the medieval period but the earliest known reference concerns the game being played c.1550 by children on a plot of land at the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]], Surrey.&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;Altham, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally believed that [[cricket]] was originally a children's game as it is not until the beginning of the 17th century that reports can be found of adult participation.&lt;ref&gt;Altham, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, all cricketers were amateurs in the literal sense of the word. [[Village cricket]] developed through the 17th century and teams typically comprised players who were all resident in the same village or parish. There is no evidence of professionalism before the [[English Civil War]] or during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] but legal cases of the period have shown that cricket was played jointly by gentry and workers.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underdown, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amateur and professional cricketers==

In the great upsurge of sport after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660, cricket flourished because so many people had encountered it as children, especially at school.&lt;ref name="Bp10"&gt;Birley, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the sport was popular, its evolution into a major sport was accelerated by gambling because, along with horse racing and prizefighting, cricket soon attracted the attention of those who were seeking to make wagers.&lt;ref name="Bc2"&gt;Birley, ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

To boost their chances of winning, some gamblers formed their own county-class teams such as [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] and [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] who played each other in 1709.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. B. Buckley]], ''Fresh Light on Pre-Victorian Cricket'', Cotterell, 1937, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Patrons like [[Edwin Stead]], the [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]] and [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage]] captained their teams and it was gentlemen like these, and the friends whom they invited to play, who began cricket's amateur tradition, while some players were paid a fee for taking part and this was the beginning of professionalism.&lt;ref name="Bc2"/&gt; Thus, a Sussex team of the 1720s might be captained by Richmond and include not only additional gentlemen like Gage but also professionals like [[Thomas Waymark]]; and this was the pattern of first-class English teams for a period of 300 years from the 1660s to the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall.&lt;/ref&gt; Waymark, for example, was employed by the Duke of Richmond as a groom and this became a common arrangement between patron and professional.&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 18th century, professionals like [[Edward "Lumpy" Stevens]] and [[John Minshull]] were employed by their patrons as gardeners or gamekeepers.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 44 and pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; But in the longer term, the professional became an employee of his club and the beginnings of this trend could be observed in the 1770s when [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]] paid match fees to its players.&lt;ref&gt;''Barclays World of Cricket'', Collins, 1980, {{ISBN|0-00-216349-7}}, pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Lord's Old Ground|Lord's]] was opened in 1787 and was intended to be the private preserve of a gentlemen's club which soon reconstituted itself as [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC).&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a gentleman could become a member but the club from its very beginning employed or contracted professionals. Lord's immediately began to stage major matches and these attracted the crowds that some members had originally sought to avoid. MCC teams soon adopted the now age-old formula of "gentlemen" and "players" in the same team.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, pp. 106–107. The MCC v [[Middlesex county cricket teams|Middlesex]] match at Lord's in 1790 featured 11 professionals with [[William Beldham]] and [[Robert Clifford (cricketer)|Robert Clifford]] playing in the MCC team.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth of cricket in the schools and universities==

There are few 17th century references to cricket being played at or in the vicinity of schools, but the sport was played by pupils at [[Eton College]] and [[Winchester College]] by the time of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name="B1"&gt;Birley, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a reference to the game at [[St Paul's School, London]] about 1665 concerning [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]], who studied there.&lt;ref name="Bp10"/&gt;

In his ''Social History of English Cricket'', [[Derek Birley]] comments that school cricket was "alive and well during the interregnum" (1649–1660) and speculates that the game "must have been known to every schoolboy in the south-east" of England.&lt;ref name="B1"/&gt; However, he doubts that the sport at this time was part of any school's curriculum. Apart from Eton and [[Westminster School]], all schools in the 17th century had local intakes and no class segregation. Therefore, the sons of rich and poor families played together.&lt;ref name="B1"/&gt;

In 1706, [[William Goldwin]] (1682–1747) published his ''Musae Juveniles'', which included a Latin poem called ''In Certamen Pilae'' (On a Ball Game). This has 95 lines and is about a rural cricket match. Goldwin himself attended Eton and then graduated to King's College, Cambridge in 1700. It is almost certain that he encountered cricket at both establishments.&lt;ref&gt;Altham, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a reference to cricket at [[Cambridge University]] in 1710 while [[Samuel Johnson]] recorded that he played cricket at [[Oxford University]] in 1729.&lt;ref&gt;Major, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1760, the Reverend James Woodforde played for "the Winchester against the Eaton (''sic'')" at Oxford.&lt;ref name="B33"&gt;Birley, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horace Walpole]] entered Eton in 1726 and later wrote that "playing cricket as well as thrashing bargemen was common".&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sackville family which produced the Dukes of Dorset, most notably [[John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset|the 3rd Duke]], sent its sons to Westminster, the 1st Duke studying there at the end of the 17th century; and it was through playing cricket at school that the game became a Sackville family tradition.&lt;ref name="A66"&gt;Altham, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B35"&gt;Birley, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of cricket to the northern counties by 1750 was partly due to "its transmission by interested clergy, schoolmasters and others educated at southern boarding schools".&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle part of the 18th century, games involving teams of ''alumni'' became popular. These fixtures ranged from a team of Old Etonians playing the Gentlemen of England in 1751 to a game at the newly opened [[Lord's Old Ground]] in 1788 which was entitled "Gentlemen Educated at Eton ''versus'' The Rest of the Schools".&lt;ref name="A66"/&gt; The [[first school cricket match]] which has been recorded was in 1794 between Westminster School and [[Charterhouse School]] with pupils playing as City of London and City of Westminster at Lords Old Ground. Westminster School played its games at Tothill Fields, which was where Vincent Square now stands. It is known to have played matches against Eton in 1792 and 1796.&lt;ref name="A66"/&gt;

Birley recorded that the "sharpest rivalry" in the middle to late 18th century was between old boys of Eton and Westminster, as these were the two oldest public schools.&lt;ref name="B33"/&gt; Notable cricketing patrons who attended those schools include the 3rd Duke of Dorset (Winchester), the [[Charles Bennet, 4th Earl of Tankerville|4th Earl of Tankerville]] and the [[George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea|9th Earl of Winchilsea]] (both Eton). Their fellow patron [[Sir Horatio Mann, 2nd Baronet|Sir Horatio Mann]] attended [[Charterhouse School]], an indication that cricket was gaining acceptance at many other schools.&lt;ref name="B35"/&gt; By 1800, it was firmly established in all public and most grammar schools.&lt;ref name="A67"&gt;Altham, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important of these "many other schools" was [[Harrow School|Harrow]], which would develop a great cricketing tradition during the 19th century and produce numerous quality players.&lt;ref name="A67"/&gt; Harrow had formerly been a grammar school but by the end of the 18th century it had become a public school. Cricket was welcomed at Harrow as elsewhere because it was seen as a useful method for keeping the boys occupied and out of mischief, this despite its strong gambling associations.&lt;ref name="A67"/&gt;

==Amateurism from 1805 to 1863==

===Schools cricket from 1805 to 1863===
Eton and Harrow definitely played each other in 1805 and there is evidence suggesting a game in 1804, perhaps sooner.&lt;ref name="A67"/&gt; The 1805 [[Eton v Harrow]] game at Lord's seems to have been organised by the boys themselves, not by the schools, and [[Lord Byron]], who played for Harrow, is believed to have hired the venue.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; These two schools eventually developed a fierce rivalry that has become the schools cricket equivalent of Cambridge v Oxford or Yorkshire v Lancashire, but they did not meet again until 1818 (twice) and 1822; after that, the fixture has occurred annually except for 1829–1831, 1856 and in wartime.&lt;ref name="A67"/&gt; [[James Pycroft]] in ''The Cricket Field'' commented on the betting at the 1825 game but, by 1833, the match had become a social highlight and ''[[The Times]]'' noted "upwards of thirty carriages containing ladies".&lt;ref name="B68"&gt;Birley, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Also by this time, the main public schools had grouped themselves into an elite circle and all other schools were decidedly viewed as second class by comparison. The elite were Charterhouse, Eton, Harrow, [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Westminster School|Westminster]] and [[Winchester School|Winchester]].&lt;ref name="B68"/&gt;

Among prominent amateurs of the Napoleonic period, [[E. H. Budd]] was an Etonian and [[William Ward (cricketer, born 1787)|William Ward]] was a Wykehamist (i.e., a Winchester pupil). Other noted "old boys" were [[Edward Grimston (St Albans MP)|Edward Grimston]], [[Charles Harenc]], [[Charles Wordsworth]] (all Harrow), [[John Kirwan (cricketer)|John Kirwan]], [[Herbert Jenner]] (both Eton) and [[William Meyrick]] (Winchester).&lt;ref name="A68"&gt;Altham, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward's old school of Winchester was the main challenger to Eton and Harrow. Harrow v Winchester was first played in 1825 and Eton v Winchester in 1826. Winchester won both of those games convincingly.&lt;ref name="A68"/&gt; [[H. S. Altham]] records that "there was a great public school festival at Lord's until its demise in 1854" which involved Eton, Harrow and Winchester.&lt;ref name="A111"/&gt; Meanwhile, of 234 "blues" awarded by Cambridge and Oxford from 1827 to 1854, 140 went to pupils of these three schools.&lt;ref name="A111"&gt;Altham, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pycroft, Winchester had the best players in the 1820s and 1830s for, at Oxford, their former pupils challenged and defeated the rest of the university and they also won a match against the combined universities at Lord's.&lt;ref name="B68"/&gt; Six Wykehamists played in the inaugural [[The University Match (cricket)|varsity match]] in 1827 but the main participants in this were [[Charles Wordsworth]] of Harrow and [[Herbert Jenner]] of Eton.&lt;ref&gt;Altham, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Harenc]] of Harrow became the best amateur bowler of the 1830s. Notable Etonians of the time included [[Harvey Fellows]] and the fearsome pace bowler [[Walter Marcon]].&lt;ref name="B69"&gt;Birley, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1820s and 1830s saw the beginning of "[[Muscular Christianity]]" in the public schools.&lt;ref name="B68"/&gt; Dr [[Thomas Arnold]] at Rugby is often considered the "founder" of this movement but in terms of cricket it was at Winchester that the best effect was achieved, especially in their athletic approach to fielding.&lt;ref name="B68"/&gt; Although this was hyped as something new, there are plenty of references to outstanding athletic fielders in the 18th century such as [[Thomas Waymark]], [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]], [[Thomas Taylor (cricketer)|Tom Taylor]] and [[William Yalden]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ashley Mote]], ''John Nyren's "The Cricketers of my Time"'', Robson, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GDC&gt;[[Ashley Mote]], ''The Glory Days of Cricket'', Robson, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest references to cricket at [[Rugby School]] and Charterhouse date from the 1820s. Other schools that gained mention in the 19th century include [[Addiscombe Military Seminary]], [[Cheltenham College]], [[Clifton College]], [[Malvern College]], [[Marlborough College]], [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]], [[Repton School]], [[Shrewsbury School]], [[Tonbridge School]], [[Uppingham School]], [[Wellington School, Somerset|Wellington]] and [[Whitgift School]].&lt;ref name="A111"/&gt;

===Gentlemen v. Players from 1806 to 1863===
{{main|Gentlemen v Players}}
[[File:Gents-v-Players-1899.jpg|right|frame|Gentlemen, captained by W. G. Grace, ''versus'' Players, [[Lord's]] 1899]]
The fixture that became the definitive expression of a cricketing class divide was first contested in 1806 when the two teams met twice.&lt;ref name="A69"&gt;Altham, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Even then, the amateurs realised they were at a real disadvantage and so their team in the inaugural match at Lord's included two of the greatest professional players, [[William Beldham]] and [[William Lambert (cricketer, born 1779)|William Lambert]] as "given men". Lambert made 57 out of 195 and, given the support he received from [[Thomas Assheton Smith II|T. A. Smith]], who scored 48, his contribution ensured that the Gentlemen won by an innings and 14 runs. The Gentlemen team was actually quite good as it also included [[Lord Frederick Beauclerk|Beauclerk]], [[John Willes (cricketer)|John Willes]], [[Edward Bligh (Irish politician)|Edward Bligh]], [[George Leycester]] and [[Arthur Upton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1800S/1806/ENG_LOCAL/GENTLEMEN_PLAYERS_07-09JUL1806.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |title=Gentlemen v Players 1806 (I) |accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second match, Beldham went back to the Players and only Lambert was a given man. Lambert again had an outstanding game and the Gentlemen won by 82 runs, though it was Beauclerk's first innings score of 58 from only 96 that was decisive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1800S/1806/ENG_LOCAL/GENTLEMEN_PLAYERS_21-25JUL1806.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |title=Gentlemen v Players 1806 (II) |accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fixture was tried again in 1819 without much success and then, to quote Birley, it "struggled on".&lt;ref name="B67"&gt;Birley, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the least auspicious occasions was in 1821 when the Gentlemen "gave up" after they had scored only 60 and the Players had reached 270–6. Birley states that this was a Coronation Match to celebrate the accession of the much-maligned [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] and that "it was a suitably murky affair!"&lt;ref name="B67"/&gt;

In 1822, the Gentlemen did manage to win on level terms thanks to their triumvirate of great batsmen: Beauclerk, Budd and Ward. Budd scored 69 out of 138 in the first innings; Beauclerk and Ward built an unbeaten partnership in the second to secure the six wicket win; and really the Players were rather let down by their batting. Having good batsmen and ordinary bowlers was to become a Gentlemen tendency. The Players on the other hand were usually strong in bowling and generally good in batting.&lt;ref name="A69"/&gt;

From 1824 to 1837, the fixture was usually an odds match, the Gentlemen having as many as 18 in 1836. In two matches, the Players were handicapped by different stump lengths.&lt;ref name="A69"/&gt; In 1835, the Gents had [[Sam Redgate]] as a given man and he caused a stir by clean bowling [[Fuller Pilch]] twice for nought.&lt;ref name="B68"/&gt; In 1836, the great [[Alfred Mynn]] played for the Gents for the first time along with [[Alfred Lowth|Alfred "Dandy" Lowth]], another noted speed merchant even though he was still a 17-year-old Winchester school boy; his promising career was cut short due to failing eyesight.&lt;ref name="B68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A70"&gt;Altham, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1841, the fixture was in disrepute and MCC refused to organise it. It was only through the efforts of [[Charles Taylor (cricketer, born 1816)|C. G. Taylor]] and the [[Frederick Ponsonby, 6th Earl of Bessborough|Hon. F. Ponsonby]] that the game could take place. They opened a subscription list to avert its collapse.&lt;ref name="A69"/&gt;

===University cricket from 1827 to 1863===
The first [[The University Match (cricket)|University Match]] between [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]] and [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]] took place at Lord's on 4 June 1827. The result was a draw. The captains were Charles Wordsworth (Oxford) and Herbert Jenner (Cambridge).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1820S/1827/ENG_LOCAL/OX-UNIV_CAMB-UNIV_UNIV_04-05JUN1827.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |title=CU v OU 1827 |accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became an annual fixture in 1838.

Cambridge and Oxford were the only English universities until 1828, when the first college at [[London University]] was founded. [[Durham University]] was the fourth in 1832 and the first "redbrick" was [[Owens College]] at Manchester in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;

About the early days of the two university clubs, H. S. Altham (himself an Oxford "blue") states that OUCC played on "that part of Cowley Common that was called the Magdalen Ground, so-called because it had been appropriated by the Magdalen College Choir School, whose headmaster made it over" (to OUCC). Cowley Common is in fact some distance from the University itself and so "the cricketers used to enjoy a ride out across the fences!" OUCC moved to [[The Parks]], its present venue, in 1881.&lt;ref name="A113"&gt;Altham, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Altham says that CUCC began at a huge public area called [[Parker's Piece]] but then became tenants at [[Fenner's]] in 1846. The club secured the lease of Fenner's in 1873. [[Francis Fenner]] had been a bowler with the [[Cambridgeshire CCC|Cambridge Town Club]] (CTC) and had acquired his land in 1846, perhaps for the express purpose of leasing it to CUCC. CTC and the subsequent [[Cambridgeshire CCC]] also played on Parker's Piece.&lt;ref name="A113"/&gt;

Playing standards at the two university clubs were ordinary until the 1860s. Altham admits that many CUCC and OUCC players were selected for the Gentlemen but points out that this owed "less to the strength of the universities than to the weakness of amateur cricket as a whole".&lt;ref name="A114"&gt;Altham, pp. 114–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted CUCC players of the period include: [[Charles Taylor (cricketer, born 1816)|C. G. Taylor]]; [[Robert Broughton (cricketer)|Robert Broughton]], who was an outstanding cover point; [[George Boudier]]; [[Robert Turner King|Robert T. King]], an all-rounder who had an outstanding season in 1849; [[Frederick Ponsonby, 6th Earl of Bessborough|Hon. F. Ponsonby]]; [[Joseph McCormick (cricketer)|Joseph McCormick]]; [[Joseph Makinson]], who played for [[Lancashire CCC]]; [[George Edward Cotterill]]; [[Herbert Marshall (cricketer)|Herbert Marshall]]; [[Arthur Daniel]]; [[Charles Lyttelton, 8th Viscount Cobham|Hon.

===The All-England Eleven===
In the middle of the 19th century, [[William Clarke's All-England Eleven]] (AEE) was a highly successful all-professional venture which did much to popularise the game. The earliest overseas tours were also all-professional affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not long before amateurs became involved in the AEE.

'''Home ultrasound''' is the provision of [[therapeutic ultrasound]] via the use of a portable or home [[ultrasound]] machine. This method of medical ultrasound therapy can be used for various types of [[pain relief]] and [[physical therapy]].

In physics, the term "ultrasound"&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=vY5rXC4xlMgC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=1mhz+ultrasound+wavelength&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xX03F7uI5C&amp;sig=_6LD38Vx-BWnYk__6jO0MyG2d5M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=D57MTOOmN8KB8gaxiLyzAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=fal&lt;/ref&gt; applies to all acoustic energy with a frequency above the audible range of human hearing. The audible range of sound is 20 hertz – 20 [[kilohertz]]. Ultrasound frequency is greater than 20 kilohertz.

== Home ultrasound machines ==

Ultrasound energy is transferred based on the frequency and power output of the ultrasonic waves that an ultrasound machine or device creates. Home ultrasound machines and doctor's office machines both operate between 1 and 5 [[megahertz]], however, home machines utilize [[Pulse wave|pulsed]] ultrasonic waves while professional ultrasound machines in a doctor's office use [[Continuous wave|continuous]] waves.

Typically, when using a home ultrasound machine, you will use it more frequently than if you were to have ultrasound treatments at a therapist's office, but the end results are the same as if using a continuous wave machine less frequently. Treatments towards a pre-workout in deep muscles and relieving tendons such as arthritis, frozen shoulder, strains, and sprains. 

== Home ultrasound benefits ==

Home ultrasound machines may have several benefits: long-term cost savings, portable physical therapy treatment, long-term pain relief for multiple symptoms, possible decrease in healing time, and can reduce chronic inflammation. Increase in knee range of motion after use for an injury's such as Osteoarthritis [[Osteoarthritis|OA]], which is the most common joint disorder and incidence increases with age. treatment of OA aims to reduce joint pain and stiffness, preserve and improve the joint mobility. The benefits have improvements for pain, function, and quality of life scales were effected by ultrasounds. 

== Different types of ultrasound therapy ==

Home ultrasound machines operate within the range of frequencies of therapeutic ultrasound, as opposed to the more commonly known diagnostic ultrasound, or [[Diagnostic ultrasound|Diagnostic sonography]]. Typical diagnostic ultrasound machines operate in the frequency range of 2-18 megahertz, whereas home ultrasound machines and therapeutic ultrasound machines operate in the frequency range of .7-3.3 megahertz. Diagnostic sonography is typically used to create an audio "image", such as during pregnancy to visualize the developing baby.

== Home ultrasound and phonophoresis ==

[[Phonophoresis]], also known as [[sonophoresis]], is the use of ultrasound to enhance the delivery of topically applied drugs. Home ultrasound allows the application of topically applied analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents through the therapeutic application of ultrasound. It is widely used in hospitals to deliver drugs through the skin. Pharmacists compound the drugs by mixing them with a coupling agent (gel, cream, ointment) that transfers ultrasonic energy from the ultrasound transducer to the skin. The ultrasound potentially enhances drug transport by cavitation, microstreaming, and heating.&lt;ref&gt;http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/75/6/539.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Home ultrasound and pregnancy ==

The ultrasonic wavelengths create an audio "image" as the machine therapeutically shows a baby growth inside the genetic mother's uterus. They serve as a monitor and have a validation of the predictions of ovulation and the IUI [[Intrauterine insemination]] cycles.

== Variety of Home ultrasounds ==

There are home ultrasounds available for purchase prices ranging from 46.00 U.S. dollars to 5,000.00. Most popular home ultrasound buys are Roscoe Medical US 1000 portable ultrasound, SonoScape A6, Acclaim US PRO 2000, UltraTENS, and dynatron.

The '''icepick grip''', otherwise known as the "reverse grip", is a technique used in close range knifefighting, in which the blade protrudes from the bottom of the hand, rather than the top&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tA3FoZh5i9IC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=%22Icepick+grip Hardcore Self-Defense - C. R. Jahn&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 91.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w8m98Ji0ndsC&amp;pg=PA241 Unarmed Defense Against Weapons - Frank Seinsheimer, Frank Seinsheimer III M.D.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9s8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA59 Black Belt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; ("natural" or "hammer" grip) of the closed fist, resembling the way one would normally use an [[icepick]] for its intended use; colloquially referred to as the "stabbing" grip.

Up until the late 1980s, the consensus amongst most [[martial arts]] experts was that the icepick grip was the mark of an amateur, and that one who chose to attack using such a grip was easily disarmed.  This argument was not entirely without merit, as many impulsive and unskilled knife attacks feature a wild downward thrust in which the knife is gripped in this manner.  However, many pragmatic martial artists who had actually been attacked with knives (such as James Keating) became increasingly vocal in their assertion that not only is it extremely dangerous for an unarmed martial artist to attempt to disarm a knifefighter, but in the hands of a reasonably proficient fighter (such as [[Eskrima]] practitioners), a knife held in this fashion is remarkably fluid and can deliver multiple cuts from a variety of angles simply by manipulating the wrist.  Such flexibility of technique make it extremely dangerous to attempt to immobilize the knife hand by grasping the wrist, as it can quickly circle around and do damage to tendons, nerves, or blood vessels.

This grip is best implemented with a double-edged knife ([[dagger]]).  If a single-edged knife is used, the edge should be facing outwards, away from the knifefighter and towards the target.  In the event that a hiltless (''sans'' crossguard) knife is used (e.g. the [[balisong (knife)|balisong]] or [[sgian dubh]]), it is advised that one "cap" the pommel with one's thumb to prevent slippage of one's hand up onto the blade upon impact with a solid object (e.g. bone) -- although, as with the much touted "sabre" and "commando" grips, failure to securely wrap the thumb around the grip will result in a greatly increased likelihood of droppage.

Geelong and Hawthorn contested the 2008 AFL Grand Final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-09-20/hawks-set-up-dream-final-with-cats/516474 Hawks set up dream final with Cats – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]&lt;/ref&gt; Geelong went into the match as the favourites; they were the defending premiers, and had lost only one match for the entire season;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2008/09/26/preview-of-afl-grand-final-stats-profiles-and-analysis/ Preview of AFL grand final: stats, profiles and analysis | The Roar]&lt;/ref&gt; however, Hawthorn prevailed by 26 points to claim its 10th premiership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-09-27/hawks-rise-over-cats-to-claim-premiership/523720 Hawks rise over Cats to claim premiership – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]&lt;/ref&gt; Ahead of the teams' first round meeting at the start of the [[2009 AFL season|2009 season]], then-Hawthorn president [[Jeff Kennett]] publicly questioned Geelong's mental drive to defeat Hawthorn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/geelong-lacks-drive-kennett/story-e6frf7jo-1225700549794 Geelong lacks drive: Jeff Kennett | Herald Sun]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, following the upset Grand Final loss, Geelong players made a private pact, which was later made public by [[Paul Chapman (footballer, born 1981)|Paul Chapman]], to never again lose to Hawthorn.&lt;ref name="chapman"&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/forget-the-kennett-curse-it-should-be-renamed-the-chapman-factor/story-fnelctok-1226442622716 Forget The Kennett Curse, it should be renamed the Chapman Factor | News.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/afl/more-news/geelong-star-paul-chapman-says-cats-never-want-to-lose-to-hawthorn-again/story-e6frf9jf-1226040925684 Geelong star Paul Chapman says Cats never want to lose to Hawthorn again | Herald Sun]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Kennett's comments, Geelong won the match in Round 1, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-03-27/cats-escape-to-avenge-grand-final-heartbreak/1633422 Cats escape to avenge grand final heartbreak – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]&lt;/ref&gt; and proceeded to defeat Hawthorn in eleven successive matches: a run that included a number of remarkable games. Kennett's demeaning comments in 2009 came to be seen{{by whom|date=October 2015}} as the initiating event of a [[sports-related curses|curse]] on Hawthorn, dubbed by fans and media as the "Kennett curse". Kennett himself (who stepped down from the Hawthorn presidency in 2011) said in 2013 that while he was not proud of what he had said, he did not wish he could take it back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watoday.com.au/afl/afl-news/hex-gets-wiki-guernsey-20130702-2p9xy.html Hex gets Wiki guernsey] Peter Hanlon (3 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The curse ended when Hawthorn defeated Geelong in the [[2013 AFL finals series|2013 First Preliminary Final]],  after Kennett's reign as Hawthorn president had ended, knocking Geelong out of the finals (Hawthorn won the Grand Final the next week to claim the Premiership).

==Results==

Over the period of the curse, the rivalry between the clubs remained strong. All matches were played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], drew at least 63,000 spectators, and although Geelong won all eleven matches, most matches were close and/or involved one team coming from a long way behind. Nine of the eleven matches were decided by ten points or less, and five by less than a goal (six points), with two decided by [[after-the-siren kicks in Australian rules football|kicks after the final siren]]: Round 17, 2009, with a behind to [[Jimmy Bartel]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxsports.com.au/news/bartel-behind-buries-hawthorn/story-e6frf6bu-1225754690174 Bartel behind buries Hawthorn | Sports News | Fox Sports]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2009/07/26/geelong-break-hawthorn-hearts-with-miracle-on-grass/ Geelong defeat Hawthorn in rivalry round thriller | The Roar]&lt;/ref&gt; and Round 19, 2012, with a goal to [[Tom Hawkins (footballer)|Tom Hawkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-08-03/cats-stun-hawks-to-win-after-the-siren/4176528 Cats stun Hawks to win after the siren – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Cats' 11-match winning streak against the Hawks is the longest by any team following a VFL/AFL Grand Final loss to their opponent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-17/for-hawks-it-cant-be-just-about-jeff-any-more/4962214?section=sport AFL Finals: Hawthorn v Geelong preview – Hawks out to end the Kennett curse with win over Cats], ''ABC Grandstand Sport (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 17 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22017">The '''May Bumps''' (also '''May Races''', '''Mays''') are a set of [[Sport rowing|rowing]] races, held annually on the [[River Cam]] in [[Cambridge]]. They began in 1887 after separating from the [[Lent Bumps]], the equivalent bumping races held at the end of February or start of March. Prior to the separation there had been a single set of annual bumps dating from its inception in 1827.&lt;ref name="bumps"&gt;John Durack, George Gilbert &amp; Dr John Marks, ''The Bumps: An Account of the Cambridge University Bumping Races 1827–1999'', 2000. {{ISBN|0-9538475-1-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The races are open to all college boat clubs from the [[University of Cambridge]], the University Medical and Veterinary Schools and [[Anglia Ruskin Boat Club]]. The May Bumps takes place over four days (Wednesday to Saturday) in mid-June and is run as a [[bumps race]].

The most recent in the series was the [[May Bumps 2018]], which ran from 13 June 2018 until 16 June 2018.

The races are run in divisions, each containing 17 crews. The number of crews in each bottom division varies yearly depending on new entrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cucbc.org/mays/gor | title=May Bumps Getting-On Race | publisher=[[Cambridge University Combined Boat Clubs]] | accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each crew contains 8 rowers and one coxswain. A total of 154 crews took part in 2014, totalling around 1390 participants. There are currently 6 divisions for men's crews (referred to as M1, M2....M6) and 4 divisions for women's crews (similarly W1-W4). The divisions represent a total race order with Division 1 at the top. The ultimate aim is to try and finish ''Head of the River'' (also said as gaining the 'Headship'), i.e. 1st position in division 1. 

At the start, signalled by a cannon, each crew is separated by a distance of about 1½ boat lengths (approximately 30m or 90'). Once the race has begun, a crew must attempt to catch up with the crew ahead of it and ''bump'' (physically touch or overtake) it before the crew behind does the same to them. A crew which bumps or is bumped must pull to the side of the river to allow all the other crews to continue racing. If a crew is able to catch and bump the boat which started 3 places in front of it, after the two in front have already bumped out, the crew is said to have ''over-bumped''. A crew which neither bumps a crew ahead nor is bumped by a crew behind before crossing the finishing post is said to have ''rowed over''. 

After the race, any crew which bumps or over-bumps swaps places with the crew that it has bumped for the following day's racing. A crew which rows over stays in the same position. Crews finishing at the top of a division also :at the bottom of the next division, as the ''sandwich boat'', in an attempt to try to move up into the next division. The process is repeated over four days, allowing crews to move up or down several places in the overall order of boats. The finishing order of one year's May Bumps are then used as the starting order of the following year's races.

NB. Prior to 1946 {{Camb|TR}} were two separate rowing clubs: 1st Trinity and 3rd Trinity, hence both separate and combined titles.&lt;ref name="tr"/&gt;

CCAT, Christ's, Clare Hall, Corpus Christi, Darwin, Girton, Homerton, Hughes Hall, King's, Magdalene, Peterhouse, Robinson, St. Catharine's, Selwyn, Sidney Sussex, St Edmund's, Wolfson, Addenbrooke's and the Veterinary School are the regular entrants never to have finished Head of the River for either the men's or women's events.

== Blades, Super-Blades, Technical Blades, and Spoons ==
Four boat 'awards' are informally/formally recognised by the individual college boat clubs that take part in the Cambridge May Bumps, these accolades are awarded as follows:

* Blades - The accolade of earning 'blades' (referring to the rowing oars used by crews) is given to crews that bump up on every day of the May bumps (alternately 4 bump ups for boats in the 'Sandwich Division'). Crews that achieve blades are often given the opportunity to purchase decoratory oars from their college boat club, to serve as a reminder of their contribution to the clubs success. For most college rowers, who do not attempt to become University Blues rowers, earning blades is the highest rowing related achievement that can be obtained. Obtaining blades is a rare occurrence. Crews who obtain blades are often photographed and recorded on the walls of the college boathouse to serve as a longer term reminder of their success, and to inspire future generations of college rowers. In the occasion that a crew earns blades, they also earn the right to row back to their college boathouse on the last day of the calendar with their college flag raised high; this practise allows for recognition of the (significant) achievement by members of other college boat clubs and the general public watching the races.
* Super-Blades - In the event that a crew bumps and/or overbumps on the river 4 times (with no row overs/bumping down) they are said to have earned 'super-blades'. This is obviously a higher distinction that standard 'Blades' but is of course rarer due to the particularly circumstantial nature of the award, and the ability of the super-bladed crew that is required.
* Technical Blades - In the case that a crew does not bump up on each day of rowing (at least), but does manage to bump up net 4 places in the overall standings over the course of the week, with no bumping down, i.e. 'making up' for any row overs with an overbump, then they are said to have qualified (at the discretion of the boatsperson at each college boat club) for 'Technical Blades'. Technical bladed rowers are usually afforded the same opportunity to obtain a ceremonial blade as those crews that obtain regular blades.
* Spoons - This 'award' is obtained by crews that bump ''down'' on every day of the May bumps calendar. The awarding of spoons is an informal occasion by the crew captain, often this captain will actually buy a wooden spoon (decorated) for each crew member as a reminder that "at least they tried".

== The Pegasus Cup ==
The '''Pegasus Cup''' is a Cambridge  rowing prize first awarded in 2006. It was donated by [[Milton Brewery]] and will be awarded annually to the most successful college boat club competing in the Cambridge May Bumping Races. The winner is decided by means of a points system, which is described in the [[Cambridge University Combined Boat Club]] handbook as follows:
[[File:PegasusCup.png|thumb|right|Pegasus Cup]] 
{{quote|The Cup is awarded to the Club gaining the most points over the course of the May Bumps. Points are awarded as follows:
* One point for every place gained by each of a Club’s boats.
* One point for each night that a Club retains the Men’s or Women’s Headship in Division One.
* One point deducted for every place lost by each of a Club’s boats.
The total number of points gained over the four days of racing is multiplied by 12 and then divided by the number of boats entered by the Club to give the final score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cucbc.org/handbook/pegasus_cup|title=Pegasus Cup|work=CUCBC Handbook|publisher=CUCBC|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To be eligible a club must have at least one men's and one women's boat (except in the case of single sex colleges where two boats of the same sex may be permitted).

'''[[Mexico]]''' participated in the ninth '''[[2006 Winter Paralympics|Winter Paralympics]]''' in [[Turin]], [[Italy]], entering one athlete.  [[Mexico]] was the only nation participating in the [[Paralympics]] that did not send a delegation to the [[2006 Winter Olympics|Torino Olympics]].

[[Paralympic alpine skiing|Alpine skier]] [[Armando Ruiz]] (LW 11, b. August 27, 1963), a lawyer from [[Mexico City]], competed in the [[giant slalom]], finishing 41st out of 41 finishers in the men's sitting category with a combined two-run adjusted time of 5:43.45, nearly four minutes behind winner [[Martin Braxenthaler]] of [[Germany at the 2006 Winter Paralympics|Germany]] and nearly three minutes behind 40th-place finisher [[Xavier Barios]] of [[Andorra at the 2006 Winter Paralympics|Andorra]].  It was the first ski race he had ever competed in, and he received a huge ovation from the crowd after completing each run.

Ruiz was one of the 3 men finalists for the Whang Youn Dai Overcome Prize of the Paralympic Games.

{{for|the Hilltop Hoods song|The Nosebleed Section}}

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the '''nosebleed section''' are the seats of a public area, usually an athletic [[stadium]] or [[gym]]nasium, that are highest and, usually, farthest from the desired activity. A common [[tongue-in-cheek]] reference to having seats at the upper tiers of a stadium is "sitting in the nosebleed section" or "nosebleed seats".  The reference alludes to the propensity for [[nasal hemorrhage]] at [[high altitude]]s, usually owing to lower [[barometric pressure]].

The origin of the expression may have been the 1970s television series ''[[Happy Days]]''.  Toward the end of one episode, [[Richie Cunningham]] (played by [[Ron Howard]]) and all his friends got to go to the JF&amp;F concert, but the tickets were for seats way up top.  Fonzie (played by [[Henry Winkler]]) uttered the words, "A guy could get a nosebleed up here".  This seems to be the first documented popular use associating "nosebleed" with the way-up-high cheap seats at a spectator event.

==In popular culture==

[[Tom Petty]]'s song "Money Becomes King" refers to a performer's original fans having to sit "way up in the nosebleeds".

In the 109th episode of [[NBC]] sitcom [[Seinfeld]] ([[The Face Painter (Seinfeld episode)|The Face Painter]]), on being offered tickets for the Stanley Cup playoff game between the [[New York Rangers]] and the [[New Jersey Devils]] by Alec Berg, Jerry Seinfeld is told "If you don't mind the nose bleed section, they're yours". 

In episode 22 of the first season of the [[NBC]] series [[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]], running back [[Tim Riggins|Timothy Riggins]] after passing on a set of tickets to the Texas State Championship to a young family, the mother of whom he has been romantically acquainted, forgets that the tickets were originally promised to his former love interest [[Tyra Collette]]. Being as she made the trip to Dallas he provides her with four players' tickets with the caveat that "those are nosebleeds".

The Australian hip hop group [[Hilltop Hoods]] have a song titled "[[The Nosebleed Section]]". In the song, the meaning of nosebleed section is reversed to mean the front row. This is because when a person has a nosebleed, they are often instructed (incorrectly) to keep their head back and look straight up - as people are forced to do in the front row of a high-stage show.{{cn|date=April 2014}}

The band [[Imagine Dragons]] also have cited the expression with the meaning of a concert section in their song "[[Thunder (Imagine Dragons song)|Thunder]]". In the verse "Now I'm smiling from the stage, while you were clapping in the nosebleeds" they show they are the successful ones, while people who criticized them at an early age are now admiring them.

American rapper [[Post Malone]] used the expression in his song “[[White Iverson]]”. He says in his verse “Bitch I'm smiling, bet you see me from the nosebleeds”. This line refers to his happiness performing and the fact that people know him.

American rapper Kanye West uses this same expression in Gucci Mane's song "P**** Print" in which he is featured. "I can take you from nose bleeds to the floor seats" This line refers to the girls that he used to bang before he got with Kim Kardashian in which he would get all the p**** he wants in exchange for floor seats.

The '''Peoples Football Stadium''' is a football stadium located near [[Port Grand]], [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. It is owned by the City District Government of Karachi. It has a capacity of 40,000. In 2016, [[Pakistan Army FC]] defeated [[PIA FC]] in the national football tournament at the stadium. &lt;ref&gt;https://tribune.com.pk/story/1070841/rangers-all-pakistan-football-tournament-rehman-hasnain-guide-army-to-title/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The stadium was built in 1988, and opened on 9 December 1995. It covers an area of {{convert|10|acre|m2}}. In 1999, when Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] came into power, new [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] imported from [[France]] worth PKR 30.7 million were installed, to enable evening matches to take place. The [[Pakistan national football team]] moved to the Peoples Football Stadium from the [[Railway Stadium]] in [[Lahore]].

The stadium, hosted the [[SAFF Championship|South Asian Football Federation Championship]] in [[South Asian Football Federation Gold Cup 2005|2005]] which was won by [[India national football team|India]]. It also hosted all the matches in the inaugural [[Geo Super Football League]] in 2007.

[[HBL FC]] who currently compete in the [[Pakistan Premier League]] play their homegames at the Peoples Football Stadium.

The '''Rajamangala National Stadium''' ({{lang-th|ราชมังคลากีฬาสถาน}}; {{RTGS|Ratchamangkhala Kila Sathan}}, {{IPA-th|râːt.t͡ɕʰā.māŋ.kʰā.lāː kīː.lāː sā.tʰǎːn|pron}}) is the national stadium of [[Thailand]] and the home stadium for the [[Thailand national football team]]. It is part of the [[Hua Mak Sports Complex]], and is located in Hua Mak Subdistrict, [[Bang Kapi District|Bang Kapi]], [[Bangkok]]. It officially opened in 1998.

==Overview==
It was first used for the [[1998 Asian Games]] in 1998 and [[ASEAN University Games|1999 ASEAN University Games]] in 1999. Since then, it has been used for many international matches and football tournaments. Most notably, for the [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]]. Thai club sides have also used the stadium when playing in continental cup competitions. Krung Thai Bank FC (now [[Bangkok Glass FC]]) used it for [[AFC Champions League]] matches, and [[PEA FC]] and [[Chonburi FC]] have recently used it in the [[AFC Cup]]. Aside from football, it has been used for athletics, pop concerts and political rallies.

Rajamangala Stadium was designed by the Faculty of Architecture at [[Chulalongkorn University]]. The main material used in construction was concrete and therefore, though the stadium is impressive and imposing, it could never be described as beautiful. However, it is undoubtedly dramatic. The stands rise and fall like a giant, exaggerated version of Huddersfield's [[Galpharm Stadium]]. At each end are quite narrow tiers of seats but the tiers rise and rise as they move round the sides until they peak level with the half-way line. From an aesthetic point of view, the stadium is best viewed from a distance, preferably from the air, where the elliptical shape of the side tribunes seems particularly pronounced.

The aforementioned side tribunes are designated 'East' and 'West'. 'East' is the uncovered popular side; 'West' is the covered side where the more expensive seats are. The two ends are designated 'North' and 'South'. 'North' is the more popular of the two. It's where the more vocal and colourful elements of the Thai support congregate.

The capacity of the stadium is 65,000. When the stadium first opened the capacity was 80,000. But plastic seats were installed on the North, South and East sides, where previously there had been bare concrete steps, in readiness for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup.

The stadium is not served by public transport which has always been a source of frustration for fans. No [[Bangkok Skytrain]]s, subway-trains or normal overground trains stop anywhere near the stadium (unlike at the [[National Stadium (Thailand)|National Stadium]], which is served by the Skytrain - [[National Stadium BTS station]]). However, there are buses and taxis which pass fairly close to the stadium. In 2010 [[Airport Rail Link (Bangkok)|Airport Rail Link]] was completed which means that the stadium is served by the City Line at - [[Ramkhamhaeng Station (Airport Rail Link)|Ramkhamhaeng Station]]. From 2022 [[MRT Orange Line]] will be open and Rajamangala Stadium Station will be located in front of the stadium.

The stadium hosted the 2012 [[Race of Champions]].

On 24 November 2013, a crowd estimated at 100,000 joined the rally around Bangkok's Democracy Monument in an anti-government protest, according to the Democrat Party, as pro-government red shirts gathered at Rajamangala Sports Stadium.

Other stadiums in Bangkok include the [[Thai Army Sports Stadium]], the [[Thai-Japanese Stadium]] and [[Chulalongkorn University Stadium]].

'''Rapa das Bestas''' (The Capture of the Beasts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Darwin Porter|author2=Danforth Prince|title=Frommer's Spain 2012|date=4 Oct 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118101865|page=21|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name of an operation that involves cutting the manes of the wild horses who live free at the mountains in a semi-feral state and that are performed in the ''curros'' (enclosed which retain the horses) held in various locations in [[Galicia (Spain)]]. Those horses live in mountains owned by the villages (a form of property derived from the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suevi]], around 8th century) and have several owners (private owners, the parish or the village), each year the foal are marked and the adults shaved and deloused, and then freed again to the mountains.

The best known is the ''Rapa das Bestas'' of [[Sabucedo]], in the city hall of [[A Estrada]], which lasts three days: the First Saturday, Sunday and Monday in July. In fact, the name given to the celebration ([[Rapa das Bestas of Sabucedo]]), while in most places speaking about curros, including curros de Valga, etc.

{{Climbing sidebar |image=Rope Climbing.jpg |caption=Rope climbing at [[Lyon]]'s Part-Dieu shopping centre}}
'''Rope climbing''' is a sport in which competitors attempt to climb up a suspended vertical rope using only their hands. Rope climbing is practiced regularly at the [[World Police and Fire Games]], and is enjoying a resurgence in [[France]], where competitions are held in shopping centers. Also, enthusiasts in the [[Czech Republic]] resurrected the sport in 1993, and hold local and national competitions.

==History and description of the event==
This was an Olympic gymnastic event at one time, but was removed from that venue after the 1932 games. In the [[United States]], competitive climbing on both 20&amp;nbsp;ft and 25&amp;nbsp;ft, {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} natural fiber ropes was sanctioned by both the [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] and the [[NCAA]] until the early 1960s, when these organizations dropped the events. As a result, intercollegiate competition in the U.S. disappeared at this time. In [[Olympic games]] held in the U.S., competitors climbed a 25&amp;nbsp;ft (7.62m) rope, but when post-1896 games were held in [[Europe]], an 8&amp;nbsp;m (26.3&amp;nbsp;ft) rope was used. In almost all contests, athletes climbed for speed, starting from a seated position on the floor and using only the hands and arms. Kicking the legs in a kind of "stride" was normally permitted. However, at the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics - Men's rope climbing|1896 Olympic games]], competitors were ranked by both time and style (holding an L-position) on a rope so long (15 meters) that some climbers did not reach the top and were therefore excluded. In all succeeding Olympics through the 1932 games, competitors were judged strictly by time of ascent on a shorter rope.

At the top of the climb, there was a circular "tambourine" with lampblack on its underside, which the climber touched. Several timers with stop watches timed the climb, and an acceptable official time was then agreed upon. Before the event expired in America, an electronic means of timing the climb was developed, but this was an insufficient reason to continue an activity conducted at gymnastic meets that many artistic gymnasts thought should have been relegated to the track and field arena. The world record for the 20&amp;nbsp;ft. climb was 2.8 seconds, first achieved by the American [http://www128.pair.com/r3d4k7/Competitive_Rope_Climbing3.html Don Perry] in the 1950s.

==World Records==
*The Official Guinness World Record for Rope Climb sets/requires a set standard of a 5-meter rope- with a 60-second time limit using hands only from a seated position; the upward 5m climbs are counted cumulatively. The World Record record of 27.8m/5.5 upward climbs (91&amp;nbsp;ft 2 in) was set by Marcus Bondi on 31/1/10 in the TV studio of "Australia Smashes Guinness World Records" verified by Official Guinness supervision.

'''Soldier Hollow''' is a cross-country ski resort located {{convert|53|mi|km}} southeast of [[Salt Lake City]] in [[Wasatch Mountain State Park]], [[Utah]], [[United States]]. The resort was created for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], and during the games it hosted the [[Biathlon at the 2002 Winter Olympics|biathlon]], [[Cross-country skiing at the 2002 Winter Olympics|cross-country skiing]] and the cross country skiing portion of the [[Nordic combined at the 2002 Winter Olympics|Nordic combined]] events.&lt;ref name="official_report"&gt;{{cite book |title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2002 |isbn=0-9717961-0-6 |pages=81–82 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf |accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since hosting the Olympics, it has been developed as a cross-country skiing, tubing, and snowshoeing resort, while featuring mountain biking and golfing in the summer. On May 1, 2016, the venue operation contract transferred from the Soldier Hollow Legacy Foundation to the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation, which owns and operates several Olympic and Paralympic legacy venues elsewhere in the state.

==History==
===Pre-Olympics===
Soldier Hollow is located in the southeastern-most part of Wasatch Mountain State Park, a {{convert|21592|acre}} nature preserve created in 1961, which became a [[Utah State Parks|state park]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stateparks.utah.gov/parks/wasatch/about |title=Wasatch Mountain State Park |author=Division of Utah State Parks and Recreation |work=Utah.gov website |accessdate=27 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316152936/http://www.stateparks.utah.gov/parks/wasatch/about |archivedate=16 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldier Hollow's location within the state park did not carry a name until Olympic organizers coined it Soldier Hollow. This name was chosen because of its proximity to Soldier Springs, a summer campsite used by Ute Indians, U.S. Army surveyors of the 1850's and others. &lt;ref&gt;http://utaholympiclegacy.org/soldier-hollow-events/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic Boosters Gave Right `Ring' To Soldier Hollow |author=Karl Cates |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=19 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to becoming a state park certain locations within the park were used for farming and grazing activities, while much of the remainder was used recreationally by locals. In the last quarter of the 20th century the state park service had been approached by private developers hoping to build luxury hotels, golf courses and other attractions within the park, but none of these plans ever came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The world is welcome at Soldier Hollow |author=Karl Cates |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/553976/The-world-is-welcome-at-Soldier-Hollow.html |newspaper=Deseret News |date=9 April 1997 |accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resort development===
The Soldier Hollow venue was one of only three which was built and designed by the [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake Organizing Committee]] (SLOC) specifically for the 2002 Winter Olympics; with the others being the [[Utah Olympic Park]] and [[Utah Olympic Oval]].&lt;ref name="soldier_hollow_report"&gt;{{cite book |title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2002 |isbn=0-9717961-0-6 |page=79 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf |accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soldier Hollow location  was chosen by SLOC as an Olympic venue in October 1997, over several other possible locations including Sherwood Hills near [[Logan, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Midway celebrates an Olympic decision |author=Karl Cates |newspaper=Deseret News |date=10 October 1997 |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/588004/Midway-celebrates-an-Olympic-decision.html |accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary work began soon after the venue site was chosen, but major construction didn't start until 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mild Days Hasten Oly Projects |author=Mike Gorrell |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=28 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work at the venue had been completed enough (80% complete) to host its first major event, [[USA Cross Country Championships|U.S. Cross Country Championships]], on January 8, 2000. Construction on the venue's day lodge began with a groundbreaking ceremony on July 5, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Soldier Hollow lodge hears the starting gun |author=Gib Twyman |newspaper=Deseret News |date=9 July 2000 |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/770687/Soldier-Hollow-lodge-hears-the-starting-gun.html |accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lodge was completed in December 2000 and dedicated on January 5, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Soldier Hollow 'Legacy' Day Lodge Dedicated |author=Tom Wharton |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=7 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venue cost SLOC $22 million [[United States dollar|USD]] to construct.

===2002 Winter Olympics &amp; Paralympics===
[[Image:Olympic western experience utah.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the venue's ''Western Experience'' during the Olympics]]
During the 2002 games Soldier Hollow hosted the [[Biathlon at the 2002 Winter Olympics|biathlon]], [[Cross-country skiing at the 2002 Winter Olympics|cross-country skiing]], and [[Nordic combined at the 2002 Winter Olympics|Nordic combined]] events. The venue itself hosted 64,160 biathlon spectators, 99,320 cross-country spectators, and 1,794 Nordic combined spectators during these events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2002 |isbn=0-9717961-0-6 |page=82 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf |accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2002 Winter Paralympics]] the venue hosted the [[Biathlon at the 2002 Winter Paralympics|biathlon]] and [[Cross-country skiing at the 2002 Winter Paralympics|cross-country]] events.

Soldier Hollow was the furthest venue from Salt Lake City with an estimated drive time of 2-2.5 hours from downtown during the games. Because of this distance from any large population centers, a special ''Western Experience'' was created at the venue's spectator plaza to give visitors activities to do between competitions. The Western Experience included music and entertainment, a [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous|mountain rendezvous]], pioneer reenactments, cowboy camps, wild mustang exhibit and American Indian displays, along with concession stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Official Spectator Guide |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2001 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to help cut down on vehicle traffic in the local canyons during the games, and to give spectators a unique experience, SLOC reached an agreement with the historic [[Heber Valley Historic Railroad|Heber Valley Railroad]] to transport spectators to the Soldier Hollow venue. A special station was constructed along the railroad tracks near the venue which would allow for two to four trains, carrying 200 passengers each, per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Full steam ahead for Creeper in '02 |author=Gib Twyman |newspaper=Deseret News |date=14 December 2000 |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/798520/Full-steam-ahead-for-Creeper-in-02.html |accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Heber Valley Railroad's numbers 618 and 75 [[Steam locomotive|steam-engines]], were joined by the [[Nevada Northern Railway Museum|Nevada Northern Railway Museum's]] number 93 steam-engine, in pulling eight-car trains full of passengers, to the Soldier Hollow depot where they disembarked and continued to the venue entrance on a horse-drawn [[Sled|sleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Official Spectator Guide |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2001 |page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.nevadanorthernrailway.net/olympics/olympics.htm |title=Salt Lake City 2002 XIX Olympic Winter Games Steam Team |author=Keith Albrandt |year=2002 |work=Nevada Northern &amp; Railroads of White Pine County website |accessdate=7 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420160239/http://history.nevadanorthernrailway.net/olympics/olympics.htm |archivedate=20 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The resort today==
The resort has been developed as a cross-country skiing, tubing, and snowshoeing resort with nearby horse-pulled sleigh riding during the winter months, while featuring mountain biking, golfing, a popular music festival and an international sheepdog competition in the summer. It is owned by the State of Utah and part of Wasatch Mountain State Park. The Division of State Parks and Recreation contracted management of the venue to a non-profit foundation. 

===Music festival===
The Wasatch Mountain Music Festival will be held at Soldier Hollow on July 14 - 16, 2017.  Under the direction and management of Vibrant America and the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation, this festival of Americana music - bluegrass, country, Texas swing, folk, gypsy jazz - has an ideal setting within a Wasatch Mountain cove.   

The large grassy staging area has two stages for non-stop music with a talented and diverse lineup of national recording artists and favorite local performers.  

There are overnight camping spaces, vendor booths and food court, family hiking or biking trails, and nearby horseback riding or covered wagon rides, along with a pioneer living history encampment with children activities.  The Heber Valley Railroad has scheduled a special "music train" to bring patrons to the event.

With a mission to educate as well as entertain, the Wasatch Mountain Music Festival will offer workshops from professionals, singer/songwriter showcases, music activities for children and opportunities for all musicians to jam and build relationships.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wasatchmountainmusic.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheepdog competition===
The site is also home to the Soldier Hollow Classic Sheepdog Championship and Festival, held on Labor Day weekend each year.  Called the "world's foremost sheepdog trial" with some 28,000 people in attendance, the event will be four day event held September 1-4, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://soldierhollowclassic.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
