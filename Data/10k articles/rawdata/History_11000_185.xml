'''Allan Bérubé''' (December 3, 1946 &amp;ndash; December 11, 2007) was an [[United States|American]] [[historian]], [[activism|activist]], [[independent scholar]], self-described "community-based" researcher and college drop-out, and award-winning [[author]], best known for his research and writing about [[homosexual]] members of the [[Military of the United States|American Armed Forces]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2007-12-17 |publisher=Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2007/12/17/allan_berube_gay_historian_chronicled_roles_in_wwii/ |title=Allan Bérubé; gay historian chronicled roles in WWII |accessdate=2007-12-21 | first=Elaine | last=Woo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote essays about the intersection of class and race in gay culture, and about growing up in a poor, working-class family, his French-Canadian roots, and about his experience of anti-[[AIDS]] activism.

Among Bérubé's published works was the 1990 book ''[[Coming Out Under Fire]]'', which examined the stories of [[gay]] men and women in the U.S. military between 1941 and 1945. The book used interviews with gay veterans, government documents, and other sources to discuss the social and political issues that faced over 9,000 servicemen and women during World War II. The book earned Bérubé the [[Lambda Literary Award]] for outstanding Gay Men's Nonfiction book of 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdaliterary.org/awards/previous_winners/paw_1988_1991.html |title=Lambda Literary Foundation, Award recipients 1988-1991 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111073036/http://www.lambdaliterary.org/awards/previous_winners/paw_1988_1991.html|archivedate=January 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later adapted as a film in 1994, narrated by [[Salome Jens]] and Max Cole, with a screenplay by Bérubé and the film's director, [[Arthur Dong]]. The film received a [[Peabody Award]] for excellence in documentary media in 1995. Bérubé received a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] (often called the "genius grant") from the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]] in 1996. He received a Rockefeller grant from the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies in 1994 to research a book on the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union, and he was working on this book at the time of his death.

Bérubé was born in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], and lived with his family in [[Monson, Massachusetts|Monson]], Massachusetts, and later in a trailer park near the waterfront in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]]. He lived for a time in [[Boston]] and for many years in [[San Francisco]]. He moved to [[New York City]], and finally settled in [[Liberty (village), New York|Liberty, New York]], where he died in 2007.

Starting in 1979, Bérubé was interviewed about his work in publications including ''[[Time (magazine)]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', ''[[Christopher Street (magazine)]]'', ''[[Gay Community News (Boston)]]'', and the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''. His many radio and television appearances included interviews by [[Studs Terkel]], Sonia Freedman on [[CNN]], and two by [[Terry Gross]] on [[National Public Radio|National Public Radio's]] ''Fresh Air''.

Bérubé was twice elected Trustee, Village of Liberty, Liberty, NY, 2003 and 2005. He also played a major role in saving the historic Munson Diner, which was moved to Liberty from Manhattan in 2005.

== Personal and professional papers ==

The records of Bérubé's life and work are preserved by the [http://www.glbthistory.org GLBT Historical Society] in San Francisco, of which he was a founding member. Bérubé donated the research and administrative files of his World War II Project to the society in 1995, with an accretion in 2000 (collection no. 1995-16). That collection is processed and open to researchers; a [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt7p3013wx?query=bérubé finding aid] is available on the Web at the [[Online Archive of California]].

Bérubé also donated the records of the Forget-Me-Nots (collection no. 1989-10), an affinity group of which he was a member; the group performed [[civil disobedience]] at the [[United States Supreme Court]] during the 1987 [[Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]], with each participant protesting in honor of an individual who had died of AIDS.

Following Bérubé's death, the executors of his estate donated his complete personal and professional papers to the Historical Society. The society has processed the papers, opened them to researchers and posted an online finding aid; the collection includes more than 75 linear feet (150-plus boxes) of records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''Anders Fryxell''' (7 February 1795{{snd}}21 March 1881) was a Swedish historian.

==Life==
Fryxell was born at Edsleskog, [[Dalsland]], (now part of [[Åmål Municipality]], [[Västra Götaland County]]) on 7 February 1795. He was educated at [[Uppsala University]], took holy orders in 1820, was made a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in 1821, and in 1823 began to publish the great work of his life, the ''Stories from Swedish History''. He did not bring this labor to a close until, fifty-six years later, he published the forty-sixth and crowning volume of his vast enterprise.{{sfn|Gosse|1911}}

Fryxell, as a historian, appealed to every class by the picturesqueness of his style and the breadth of his research; he had the gift of awakening to an extraordinary degree the national sense in his readers. In 1824 he published his ''Swedish Grammar'', which was long without a rival. In 1833 he received the title of [[professor]], and in 1835 he was appointed to the incumbency of [[Sunne, Sweden|Sunne]], in the [[diocese of Karlstad]], where he resided for the remainder of his life. In 1840 he was elected to the [[Swedish Academy]] in succession to the poet [[Johan Olof Wallin]] (1779&amp;ndash;1839). In 1847 Fryxell received from his bishop permission to withdraw from all the services of the Church, that he might devote himself without interruption to historical investigation.{{sfn|Gosse|1911}}

Among his numerous minor writings are prominent his ''Characteristics of Sweden between 1592 and 1600'' (1830), his ''Origins of the Inaccuracy with which the History of Sweden in Catholic Times has been Treated'' (1847), and his ''Contributions to the Literary History of Sweden''.{{sfn|Gosse|1911}}

It is now beginning to be seen that the abundant labors of Fryxell were rather of a popular than of a scientific order, and although their influence during his lifetime was unbounded, it is only fair to later and exacter historians to admit that they threaten to become obsolete in more than one direction.{{sfn|Gosse|1911}}

Fryxell was the founder of the progressive pioneer school ''[[Wallinska skolan]]'', the first serious secondary education girl school in Stockholm, and was its principal in 1831-1834.&lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt &amp; söner, Stockholm, 1914&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 21 March 1881 Anders Fryxell died at Stockholm, and in 1884 his daughter Eva Fryxell (born 1829) published from his MS. an interesting ''History of My History'', which was really a literary autobiography and displays the persistency and tirelessness of his industry.{{sfn|Gosse|1911}}

He was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1847.{{sfn|Gosse|1911}}

[[File:Bixa orellana fruit open.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Open fruit of the [[achiote]] tree (''Bixa orellana''), showing the seeds from which annatto is extracted.]]
'''Annatto''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|n|æ|t|oʊ}} or {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|n|ɑː|t|oʊ}}) is an orange-red [[condiment]] and [[food coloring]] derived from the seeds of the achiote tree (''[[Bixa orellana]]'') native to [[tropics|tropical]] regions from [[Mexico]] to [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="cabi"&gt;{{cite web |title=''Bixa orellana'' (annatto) |url=https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/9242 |publisher=CABI |accessdate=14 October 2018 |date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used to impart a yellow or orange color to foods, but sometimes also for its flavor and aroma. Its scent is described as "slightly peppery with a hint of [[nutmeg]]" and flavor as "slightly nutty, sweet and peppery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theepicentre.com/Spices/annatto.html |title=Encyclopedia of Spices |publisher=TheEpicentre.com |accessdate=24 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mr3G6rYM?url=http://www.theepicentre.com/Spices/annatto.html |archivedate=17 January 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color of annatto comes from various [[carotenoid]] [[pigment]]s, mainly [[bixin]] and norbixin, found in the reddish waxy coating of the seeds. The condiment is typically prepared by grinding the seeds to a powder or paste. Similar effects can be obtained by extracting some of the color and flavor principles from the seeds with hot water, [[oil]], or [[lard]], which are then added to the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Smith |first= James |title= Annatto Extracts |work= Chemical and Technical Assessment |publisher= [[JECFA]] |year= 2006 |url= ftp://ftp.fao.org/ag/agn/jecfa/cta_annatto.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annatto and its extracts are now widely used in an artisanal or industrial scale as a coloring agent in many processed food products, such as cheeses, [[spread (food)|dairy spreads]], [[butter]] and [[margarine]], [[custard]]s, [[cake]]s and other baked goods, [[potato]]es, [[snack foods]], [[breakfast cereals]], [[smoked fish]], [[sausage]]s, and more. In these uses, annatto is a natural alternative to synthetic [[food coloring]] compounds, but it has been linked to rare cases of food-related [[allergy|allergies]].&lt;ref name=WAOJ/&gt; Annatto is of particular commercial value in the United States because the [[Food and Drug Administration]] considers colorants derived from it to be "[[Food coloring#Natural food dyes|exempt of certification]]".

== History ==
The annatto tree ''B. orellana'' is believed to originate in tropical regions from Mexico to Brazil.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bija – Achiote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indio.net/taino/main/remedio/bija.htm |title=Bija – Achiote |publisher=Indio.net |date= |accessdate=24 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724104743/http://www.indio.net/taino/main/remedio/bija.htm |archivedate=24 July 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably not initially used as a food additive, but for other purposes such as ritual and decorative body painting (still an important tradition in many Brazilian native tribes), sunscreen, and insect repellent, and for medical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getjamaica.com/Jamaican%20Annato.asp |title=Jamaican Annatto |publisher=GetJamaica.com |accessdate=24 August 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110711090828/http://www.getjamaica.com/Jamaican%20Annato.asp |archive-date= 11 July 2011 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Nigel J.H. |title=Geography of Crop Plants |work=Geo 3315, Lecture Notes: Part 2 |publisher=Department of Geography, University of Florida |year=2005 |url=http://www.geog.ufl.edu/courses/Fall_Syllabus/3315Part2.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070922113838/http://www.geog.ufl.edu/courses/Fall_Syllabus/3315Part2.pdf |archive-date= 22 September 2007 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lovera |first= José Rafael |title= Food Culture in South America |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group |series= Food Culture Around the World |year= 2005 |page= 51 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=paihl6TEZpUC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=annatto+venezuela+onoto |isbn= 978-0-313-32752-0 |accessdate= 24 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for Mexican manuscript painting in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aic.stanford.edu/sg/bpg/annual/v16/bp16-05.html |title=Colorants Used During Mexico's Early Colonial Period |publisher= Stanford University |year=1997 |accessdate=24 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080320051026/http://aic.stanford.edu/sg/bpg/annual/v16/bp16-05.html| archivedate=20 March 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annatto has been traditionally used as both a coloring and flavoring agent in [[Latin America]], the [[Caribbean]], and other countries where it was taken home by Spanish and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; It has various local names according to region.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; Its use has spread in historic times to other parts of the world, and it was incorporated in local culinary traditions of many countries outside the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinesinsider.com/filipino-cuisine/common-spices-in-modern-philippine-recipes/ |title=Common Spices in Modern Philippine Recipes |publisher=PhilippinesInsider.com |accessdate= 24 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110715075231/http://www.philippinesinsider.com/filipino-cuisine/common-spices-in-modern-philippine-recipes/ |archivedate= 15 July 2011 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culinary uses==

===Traditional cuisine===
Ground annatto seeds, often mixed with other seeds or spices, are used in the form of paste or powder for culinary use, especially in [[Latin American]], [[Jamaica]]n, [[Belize]]an, [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]], Vietnamese, and [[Filipino cuisine]]s. In [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] and [[Belizean cuisine]]s, it is used to make the spice ''[[recado rojo]]''. In [[Venezuela]], annatto is used in the preparation of ''[[hallaca]]s, [[perico (dish)|perico]]'', and other traditional dishes. ''[[Pasteles]] ''and ''sazón'' in [[Puerto Rico]] also contain annatto. Annatto paste is an important ingredient of ''[[cochinita pibil]]'', the spicy pork dish popular in Mexico. It is also a key ingredient in the drink ''[[tascalate]]'' from [[Chiapas]], Mexico. In the [[Philippines]], it is used for the sauce of ''[[pancit]]''.

===Industrial food coloring===
[[File:Colby Cheese.jpg|thumb|[[Colby cheese]] colored with annatto]]
Annatto is used currently to impart a yellow or orange color to many industrialized and semi-industrialized foods. In the European Union, it is identified by the [[E number]] E160b.

Annatto has been a traditional colorant for [[Gloucester cheese]] since the 16th century. During the summer, the high levels of carotene in the grass would have given the milk an orange tint which was carried through into the cheese. This orange hue came to be regarded as an indicator of the best cheese, spurring producers of inferior cheese to use annatto to replicate it. The custom of adding annatto then spread to other parts of the UK, for cheeses such as [[Cheshire cheese|Cheshire]] and [[Red Leicester]], as well as colored [[cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] made in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcheese.com/doublegloucester |title=British Cheese Board |publisher=BritishCheese.com |accessdate=24 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726112327/http://www.britishcheese.com/doublegloucester| archivedate= 26 July 2011 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/11/07/243733126/how-17th-century-fraud-gave-rise-to-bright-orange-cheese |first=Allison |last=Aubrey |title=How 17th Century Fraud Gave Rise To Bright Orange Cheese |work=The Salt |publisher=NPR |date=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cheddars are produced in both white and red (orange) varieties, with the latter being more popular despite the only difference between the two being the presence of annatto as a coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyedge.ie/red-cheddar-is-a-lie-2226128-Jul2015 |title='Sorry Ireland: 'Red cheddar' doesn't really exist' |publisher=DailyEdge.ie |accessdate=8 December 2015| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150725153602/http://www.dailyedge.ie/red-cheddar-is-a-lie-2226128-Jul2015/| archivedate= 25 July 2015| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; That practice has extended to many modern [[processed cheese]] products, such as [[American cheese]] and [[Velveeta]].

==Chemical composition==
[[File:bixin.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Bixin]], the major [[apocarotenoid]] of annatto&lt;ref name="ntp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntp-server.niehs.nih.gov/?objectid=F59ACAC5-F1F6-975E-7C563568F5F7351B#selection |title=Executive Summary Bixin |work= National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences |publisher=National Institutes of Health |date=Nov 1997 |accessdate=24 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721055506/http://ntp-server.niehs.nih.gov/?objectid=F59ACAC5-F1F6-975E-7C563568F5F7351B| archivedate= 21 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The yellow to orange color is produced by the chemical compounds bixin and norbixin, which are classified as [[carotenoids]]. The fat-soluble color in the crude extract is called [[bixin]], which can then be [[Saponification|saponified]] into water-soluble [[norbixin]]. This dual solubility property of annatto is rare for carotenoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Smith |first= James |first2= Harriet |last2=Wallin |title= Annatto Extracts: Chemical and Technical Assessment |publisher= [[JECFA|FAO]] |year= 2006 |url= http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/agns/pdf/jecfa/cta/67/annatto.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 10 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The seeds contain 4.5–5.5% pigment, which consists of 70–80% bixin.&lt;ref name="ntp" /&gt; Unlike [[beta-carotene]], another well-known carotenoid, annatto-based pigments are not [[vitamin A]] precursors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Kuntz |first= Lynn A. |title= Natural Colors: A Shade More Healthy |work= Food Product Design |publisher= Virgo Publishing, LLC |date= 4 August 2008 |url= http://www.foodproductdesign.com/articles/2008/08/natural-colors-a-shade-more-healthy.aspx |accessdate= 26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more norbixin in an annatto color, the more yellow it is; a higher level of bixin gives it a more orange shade.

== Safety ==
In the United States, annatto extract is listed as a color additive "[[Food coloring#Regulation|exempt from certification]]" and is informally considered to be a natural coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_02/21cfr73_02.html |title=Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations part 73 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=73.30 |title=CFR Title 21 |publisher= U.S. FDA |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foods colored with annatto may declare the coloring in the statement of ingredients as "colored with annatto" or "annatto color."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=21CFR101.22 |work=Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, Volume 2 |publisher=FDA |date=1 April 2011 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.22 |accessdate=7 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annatto condiments and colorants are safe for most people when used in food amounts, but they may cause allergic reactions in those who are sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-23-ANNATTO.aspx?activeIngredientId=23&amp;activeIngredientName=ANNATTO |title=ANNATTO: Uses, Side Effects, Interactions and Warnings |publisher=WebMD |date=30 July 1999 |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Magee |first= Elaine |url= http://blogs.webmd.com/healthy-recipe-doctor/2010/07/whats-up-with-food-dyes.html |title=What's Up With Food Dyes? |work=Healthy Recipe Doctor |publisher=WebMD |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one 1978 study of 61 patients suffering from chronic [[hives]] or [[angioedema]], 56 patients were orally provoked by annatto extract during an elimination diet. A challenge was performed with a dose equivalent to the amount used in {{convert|25|g}} of butter. Twenty-six percent of the patients reacted to this color four hours after intake, worse than synthetic dyes such as [[Amaranth (dye)|amaranth]] (9%), [[tartrazine]] (11%), [[Sunset Yellow FCF]] (17%), [[Food Red 17]] (16%), [[Ponceau 4R]] (15%), [[erythrosine]] (12%) and [[Brilliant Blue FCF]] (14%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pmid=150265 |year=1978 |last1=Mikkelsen |first1=H |last2=Larsen |first2=JC |last3=Tarding |first3=F |title=Hypersensitivity reactions to food colours with special reference to the natural colour annatto extract (butter colour) |issue=1 |pages=141–3 |journal=Archives of Toxicology.

Annatto is not among the "Big Eight" substances causing [[hypersensitivity reaction]]s (cow's [[milk]], [[egg]], [[peanut]]s, tree nuts, fish, [[shellfish]], [[soy]], and [[wheat]]), which are responsible for more than 90% of allergic food [[allergic reaction|reactions]].&lt;ref name=WAOJ&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/WOX.0b013e3181c5be33 |title=An Allergy to Goldfish?

==Human research==
As annatto is a source of [[tocotrienol]]s, such as [[geranylgeraniol]]—compounds similar in structure and function to [[vitamin E]]—its extracts were under preliminary research {{As of|2015|lc=y}} to determine their potential biological properties in humans. In one such application, annatto geranylgeraniol is an ingredient in an experimental [[medical food]] being investigated for its effect on blood [[lipoprotein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.plefa.2015.05.002 |title=Safety and lipid-altering efficacy of a new omega-3 fatty acid and antioxidant-containing medical food in men and women with elevated triacylglycerols |year=2015 |authors=Maki KC, Geohas JG, Dicklin MR, Huebner M, Udani JK |journal=Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids|volume=99|pages=41–6|pmid=26076828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Averil Margaret Lysaght''' (14 April 1905 – 21 August 1981) was a New Zealand biologist, science historian and artist, best known for her scholarly work on [[Joseph Banks]].&lt;ref name="Te Ara 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomson|first1=A. D.|title=Story: Lysaght, Averil Margaret|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/5l25/lysaght-averil-margaret|website=Te Ara|publisher=The Government of New Zealand|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lysaght was born in [[Mokoia]], [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]], [[New Zealand]] on 14 April 1905 to Emily Muriel Lysaght née Stowe and Brian Cuthbert Lysaght.&lt;ref name="Hawera 1993"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Lysaght, Averil Margaret (Dr)|editor1-last=Clement|editor1-first=Christine|editor2-last=Johnston|editor2-first=Judith|title=Women of South Taranaki, their stories = Nga wahine toa o Taranaki tonga, o ratou korero|date=1993|publisher=Hawera Suffrage Centennial Local History Group|location=Hawera, New Zealand|isbn=0473020467|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When she was 15 she discovered on [[Mount Taranaki]] an [[owlet moth]] previously unknown to science.  That species was [[List of species described in 1921|described in 1921]] by [[entomologist]] [[George Hudson (entomologist)|G. V. Hudson]] and named ''[[Graphania averilla]]'' in her honour.&lt;ref name="Notornis 1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bourne|first1=W.R.P.|title=Obituary: Averil Margaret Lysaght (1905-1981) and the natural history records from Cook's voyages.|journal=Notornis|date=1982|volume=29|issue=1|pages=79–80|url=http://www.bugz.org.nz/WebForms/ResultDetails.aspx?CurrentDoc=CA82DBDE-1708-41C6-AE3B-47D46F9880C2&amp;CurrentPage=1&amp;searchType=7&amp;StartChar=%EF%BF%BD|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Lysaght was initially educated at home by a governess but was sent to Chilton House Private Girls Boarding School in [[Wellington]] when she was 12.&lt;ref name="Hawera 1993" /&gt; In 1923 Lysaght began studying for a degree at [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University College]], Wellington.&lt;ref name="Te Ara 2015" /&gt; While attending University, Lysaght joined the Victoria University tramping club and went on tramps with [[John Beaglehole]], with whom she later collaborated on scholarly works.&lt;ref name=Beaglehole&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beaglehole|first1=Tim | author1-link=Tim Beaglehole |title=A Life of J. C. Beaglehole: New Zealand Scholar|date=2006|publisher=Victoria University Press|location=Wellington, New Zealand|page=|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/name-412970.html|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|73}} While studying for her bachelor's degree Lysaght published her first papers on entomology. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1928 and obtained a Masters in Science in 1929.  Her thesis was on the biology of [[Eucolaspis]], a [[genus]] of beetle.&lt;ref name="Te Ara 2015" /&gt;  From 1927 to 1929 she was on the staff of the [[Cawthron Institute]]'s department of entomology and from 1931 to 1932 she was employed by Victoria University College as a temporary assistant in zoology.&lt;ref name="Te Ara 2015" /&gt;

Subsequent to this Lysaght moved to England to live and continued her education.  Lysagh spent three years undertaking postgraduate research at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in London, after which she was awarded a Doctorate from the University of London in 1935.&lt;ref name=Beaglehole /&gt;{{rp|358}} Her doctorate thesis was on the nematode parasites of thrips.&lt;ref name="Hawera 1993" /&gt;

During this time Lysaght undertook artistic training first at Nottingham School of Art and later at St Martins School of Art in London.&lt;ref name="Hawera 1993" /&gt;

==Work==
From 1935 to 1938 Lysaght was employed at the Plymouth laboratory of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. She also worked at the Imperial Institute of Entomology. Between 1936 and 1943 she published five papers in [[parasitology]], including two papers on trematode parasites of [[gastropods]].  Lysaght subsequently obtained employment as an assistant editor of the zoology section of ''Chambers Encyclopaedia''.  During her time there, either in 1947 or 1948 she met [[Norman Kinnear]], Keeper of Zoology at the British Museum of Natural History. It was Kinnear who suggested she research the birds of Cook's voyages.  He assisted her in this endeavour by providing space for her to work at the British Museum of Natural History.&lt;ref name=Beaglehole /&gt;{{rp|358}}  Lysaght proceeded to catalogue all the bird paintings executed on all Cook's voyages.&lt;ref name="Hawera 1993" /&gt; She also did in depth research on the museums' collection of Sydney Parkinson's paintings and drawings and continued to work at this project for over twenty years. As a result of her research she did much to help identify drawings by Herman Spöring, Bank's assistant.&lt;ref name=Beaglehole /&gt;{{rp|358}}  This culminated in her publishing in 1975 ''The book of birds: five centuries of bird illustration''.

During this time Lysaght also edited the zoological material for the [[Hakluyt Society]]'s edition of Cook's first two voyages. She also provided [[John Cawte Beaglehole]] with much of the zoological and botanical notes for his books on James Cook's three voyages.&lt;ref name="Hawera 1993" /&gt;

==Painting==
'Lysaght was a talented artist, a gift that apparently first developed at [[Nottingham Trent University, School of Art and Design|Nottingham]] and later at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London.'&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Thomson, 'Lysaght, Averil Margaret', first published in the ''Dictionary of New Zealand Biography'', volume five, 2000, and then in ''Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand''.&lt;/ref&gt; A solo exhibition of her work was held at the [[Leicester Galleries]], in October 1961.&lt;ref&gt;No. 19, sold to [[Crofton family|Malby Crofton]], Esq., (1923-dsp 2002). Sir Malby joined Kensington Borough Council in 1962 and was its leader 1968-77 (during which time [[Grenfell Tower]] was put up), and Mayor of Kensington &amp; Chelsea, 1978. (info: Michael Rhodes, etal).&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her water-colour paintings were on 'Siamese paper made from the fibres of the [[Daphne (plant)|daphne bush]]'.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Thomson, 'Lysaght, Averil Margaret', first published in the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, vol. 5, 2000, and then in Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt; Lysaght's October 1961 show of water-colours (no. 1222) coincided with ones the Leicester Galleries held for [[Kyffin Williams]] (no. 1223) and [[Anne Madden]] (no. 1221), whose work was influenced by [[Sam Francis]], [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], and by her husband [[Louis le Brocquy]], as too it seems was Lysaght's, notably Riopelle.&lt;ref&gt;See: Averil Lysaght : ''First exhibition of water-colours''. [[Anne Madden]] : ''Recent water-colours''. [[Kyffin Williams]] : ''New paintings''. Ernest Brown &amp; Phillips, [[Leicester Galleries]], London, 1961. (12 pages). (bound as one).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Lysaght died on the 21 August 1981 in London.&lt;ref name="Hawera 1993" /&gt;

[[File:Battle of Hastings 7.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Battlefield photo]]
[[File:BattleNormannen.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The lines drawn up in front of [[Battle Abbey]]]]

The '''Battle of Hastings reenactment''' is a yearly [[historical reenactment|reenactment]] of the [[Battle of Hastings]], held at [[Battle Abbey]] in [[Battle, East Sussex]], UK, and drawing participants from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News: "Normans fight Saxons... and the rain". "Among the warriors on the battlefield will be enthusiasts from as far away as Australia, New Zealand and the US."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iggulden. "Among the re-enactors flying in are Poles, Russians, Czechs, Americans and Canadians. Two Frenchman have broken ranks for the first time to fight for the Saxons, the Germans are sending more than 100 for Harold, and the Finns have mustered 16. Admittedly, Iceland's 22 men are fighting for William the Conqueror, alongside the Irish, and Harold's brother Leofwine Godwinson is being played by an Australian."&lt;/ref&gt; It takes place every year on the weekend nearest 14 October on the site of the historical battle, although is often arranged across the hill rather than up it, to take account of the smaller number of participants and the need for spectators.

The event is run by [[English Heritage]], which owns the site, and attended by several thousand people yearly.  For many years it was an event for amateur groups of reenactors, but more recently has involved scenes by professional actors.

Every five or six years since 1984 it has been the site of major reenactments – 1984, 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2006. At the 2000 reenactment, called "[[Hastings 2000]]", about 1000 reenactors on foot,&lt;ref&gt;BBC News: "Normans fight Saxons... and the rain". "A major re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings in 1066, involving 1,000 Normans and Saxons, will go ahead this weekend despite the flooding in East Sussex."&lt;/ref&gt; 100 cavalry and between 50 and 100 archers from 16 different countries took part.

The 2006 event [[Hastings 2006]] was, for a while, referred to as TNBO, "The Next Big One." The phrase was coined in 2001 or 2002 by an Australian re-enactor following the event in 2000 when questions began being asked about when 'The Next Big One' would be held.

The 2006 event saw a much larger attendance than in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Richards. "As many as 3,000 re-enactors from across the world have camped out at Battle Abbey for performances on Saturday and Sunday."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iggulden. "More than 3,000 fighters, a three-fold increase on the previous "Mega Battle" of 2000, are massing in full war dress this week to play out a specially extended script, to commemorate the best-known date in British history."&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 3,400 reenactors registered, and about 2,400 people took part on each of the two days, watched by a total crowd of about 30,000 paying public.&lt;ref&gt;Richards. "Tens of thousands of visitors had plenty more than the battle restaging to occupy themselves with."&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is believed to have been the largest pre-gunpowder reenactment ever held anywhere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2245">'''Bernard André''', [[Order of St. Augustine|O.E.S.A.]] (1450–1522), also known as Andreas, was a [[French people|French]] [[Order of St. Augustine|Augustinian friar]] and poet, who was a noted chronicler of the reign of [[Henry VII of England]], and [[poet laureate]].

A native of [[Toulouse]], André was tutor to [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Prince Arthur of England]], and probably had a share in the education of the future King [[Henry VIII]]. He was also a tutor at Oxford, and seems to have been blind. His writings are mostly in Latin, and are typical of the contemporary Renaissance, in thought and diction. His ''Historia Henrici Septimi'' was edited (1858) by [[James Gairdner]], who says of André's chronicle of events in the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497]] that it is valuable "only as one of the very few sources of contemporary information in a particularly obscure period".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3267">'''Constant Fouard''' (6 August 1837 at [[Elbeuf]], near [[Rouen]] &amp;ndash; 1903) was a French ecclesiastical writer.

==Life==

His early life was a preparation for the work on which his fame rests. He studied the classics at [[Bois-Guillaume]], philosophy at [[Issy]] (1855-1857), and made his theological studies at [[Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]], Paris (1857–61). Along his professors at Paris were Abbé John Logan, who remained throughout life the inspirer and mentor of his studies and [[Abbe Le Hir]], who initiated him and his fellow disciple [[Fulcran Vigouroux]] into Biblical science, to which they devoted their lives.{{sfn|Fenlon|1913}}

He was ordained priest in 1861 and entered the "Solitude", the [[novitiate]] of the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|Sulpicians]], but left on account of illness after several months without joining the society. He taught for some time at Bois-Guillaume, then pursued the study of classics at the [[Collège Sainte-Barbe]], Paris, obtained the degree of Licentiate in Letters, 1867, and resumed; the teaching of classics at Bois-Guillaume, taking the class of rhetoric, 1867-1876. His piety drawing him to sacred sciences, he was appointed by the State (1876) to the chair of Holy Scripture in the faculty of theology at Rouen; he continued however to reside at Bois-Guillaume and to share in the duty of governing the student-body.{{sfn|Fenlon|1913}}

Honours came to him: he was made [[doctor of theology]] (1877), canon of the [[cathedral of Rouen]] (1884) and member of the Biblical Commission (1903). He travelled in Palestine, Syria, Greece, and Italy.{{sfn|Fenlon|1913}}

His teaching ceased when the Faculty of Theology was forcibly closed down c. 1884.{{sfn|Fenlon|1913}}

==Works==

His writings include:{{sfn|Fenlon|1913}}
*''La Vie de N-S Jésus-Christ'' (1880);
*''Saint Pierre et les premières années du Christianisme'' (1886);
*''Saint Paul, ses Missions" (1892);
*''Saint Paul, ses dernières années'' (1897);
*''Saint Jean et la fin de l'Âge Apostolique'' (posthumous, 1904).

The dates witness, incidentally, to the extremely painstaking character of his labours. All these books form part of one grand work, ''Les Origines de l'Eglise'', which Fouard wrote as an answer to the presentation of the same subject by [[Ernest Renan]], who like himself had seen a pupil of le Hir.{{sfn|Fenlon|1913}}

Each successive book of the Abbé Fouard immediately gained a wide popularity and was translated into nearly all the language of Europe. His works are not remarkable in originality of view or acuteness of critical insight, but present a picture of early Christianity.{{sfn|Fenlon|1913}}

Soon after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|attacks of September 11, 2001]], the [[United States Government]] began [[detaining]] people who fit the profile of the suspected [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacker]]s: mostly male, [[Arab]]ic or [[Muslim]] [[citizenship|noncitizens]]. By late November 2001, more than 1,200 people had been detained and held [[Solitary confinement|incommunicado]] (''Without the means or right to communicate'').

Those opposed of the detentions labeled these detentions "secret", as such detentions are contrary to American democratic principles of openness and freedom. The government was also criticized for singling out Arabs, Muslims and foreigners, implying that this was "[[racial profiling]]" at its worst.

At that time, the government announced that it ''suspected'' 10 to 15 of the detainees as being [[al Qaeda]] sympathizers, but said that no evidence links them directly to the attacks. Most of these people are being held in New York on [[material witness]] warrants. Opponents of the detentions claimed that the government had no valid grounds for such a massive number of detentions, ''especially those held without any evidence''.

About 1000 detainees are in federal custody on immigration charges.

About 70 Israelis have been detained, but were later released.

==Detainees==
'''Osama Awadallah''' wrote about one of the hijackers in a college exam book.{{Clarify|date=September 2009}}

'''Mohdar Abdallah''''s name was found on a slip of paper in a rental car one of the hijackers parked at [[Dulles International Airport]].

'''Hady Hassan Omar''', an Egyptian antiques dealer from Arkansas, made plane reservations on a computer at [[Kinkos|Kinko's]] about the same time one of the hijackers did so at the same place.

'''Osama Elfar''' (November 9, 1971- ), an Egyptian from [[Alexandria, Egypt]], went to the United States in 1996 to attend [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] in [[Daytona Beach]], Fla. He worked as a flight mechanic for [[Trans States Airlines]] at [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]] for several years. On September 24, he was arrested by FBI agents, who also seized his address book, phone bills and computer. On October 5, he was administered a [[lie detector]] test. He has been detained at [[Mississippi County Correctional Facility]] in [[Charleston, Missouri]] since. In early November, he received a "voluntary departure", which forces one to leave the country but does not forbid a later return. On November 23, he was scheduled to depart, but he was not released. He began a hunger strike that day; as he was already fasting during the day for [[Ramadan]], he now only drinks a single glass of water at sunset. He is being represented by [[Dorothy Harper]].

'''Ali al-Maqtari''', 26, was born in Yemen, studied in France and went to the United States on a tourist visa in 2000 hoping to become a French teacher. In June 2001, he married Tiffany Hughes, a native of [[North Carolina]] and a convert to Islam, whom he met through an online chat room. They moved to [[New Haven, Connecticut]], where he planned to study at [[Southern Connecticut State University]] that fall. Hughes, a member of the [[United States National Guard]], wanted to enlist in the [[U.S. Army]]. On September 13, while wearing a [[hijab|head scarf]], she picked up her military orders in Massachusetts to go to [[Fort Campbell, Kentucky]]. While Al-Maqtari drove her there, her photograph was posted at the Fort Campbell guardhouse. Upon their arrival on September 15, he was taken to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] for questioning. Two box cutters and postcards of New York City were found in the car. They were both administered [[polygraph]] tests; Hughes was informed that the tests showed that she and her husband had lied, and that the results were being sent to the Pentagon.

Guards followed Hughes around the base, while other soldiers openly asked her if she was a spy. On October 28, she took an [[honorable discharge]], as encouraged by base officers.

Al-Maqtari's detention began on September 17 at the [[West Tennessee Detention Center]] in [[Mason, Tennessee]]. He was allowed to speak on telephone with his wife once a week. On October 1, an immigration judge agreed to release him on [[US$]]50,000 bond, but the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] appealed to the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]], claiming he was a danger to the community. The board said the service could continue to hold Mr. Maqtari, but asked for additional proof.

On October 11, [[Michael E. Rolince]], the FBI's international terrorism section chief, submitted an affidavit which asserted, "What may seem trivial to some may appear of great moment to those within the F.B.I. or the intelligence community." The affidavit also asserted that the bureau was unable to rule out the possibility al-Maqtari was linked to the September 11 attack, and that he might be part of a terrorist "mosaic". No further evidence was submitted. In mid-November, the board said he could be released.

In June 2002, they will have to appear before court to prove that their marriage is for real, and not for a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|Green Card]].

He is being represented by [[Michael J. Boyle]] of New Haven.

'''Ahmed Abou el-Kheir''', 28, of Egypt, went to the United States on a tourist visa on September 7, staying at a hotel in suburban Maryland. Mr. Kheir was arrested the week of the attack and charged with trespassing in the hotel. He was detained in the [[Passaic County]] jail in [[New Jersey]], shown photographs of the hijackers, and was administered a [[lie detector]] test. In late September, while still in custody, Mr. Kheir was charged in sealed documents as a material witness. On October 11, investigators dismissed the material witness order.

Within twenty-four hours, before he was released, he was served with an arrest warrant charging that he had failed to pay a [[US$]]250 fine for a 1998 disorderly conduct charge in the Bronx. On October 12, he appeared before a judge in the Bronx. The warrant was vacated, and he was given a conditional discharge.

Then the Immigration and Naturalization Service requested to detain him, charging that he had held jobs (he had worked as a dishwasher) while on a tourist visa on his two previous visits to the United States. His deportation was ordered, but the INS will not deport him without his passport, which is in the FBI's custody.

He is being represented by [[Martin R. Stolar]].

'''Yael Antebi''', 21, a red-headed woman from [[Haifa]], Israel, went to the United States in late September to visit her boyfriend, also Israeli, on a tourist visa. Both worked selling toys in shopping mall kiosks, a violation of the visa. While leaving a message on the telephone for her father, she was arrested by INS agents at 2:30 AM CST November 1 from her apartment in [[Columbia, Missouri]]. She was detained until November 19.

'''Hady Hassan Omar''' was held without trial and placed in solitary confinement for 73 days. For a long period after his arrest, he was not allowed access to an attorney. One of prison guards told him, "The attorney general just signed a new law today. We can keep you here as long as we like." He was subjected to repeated interrogations. He threatened hunger strikes, but was told by prison officials that they would just strap him to a gurney and force-feed him through a tube up his nose. After 73 days, he threatened suicide, and finally officials decided that he was innocent and released him.

'''Ali K. Steitiye''', 41, was arrested October 24, 2001 while driving in [[Portland, Oregon]] on charges related to being part of an alleged terror cell. This followed an episode on September 29, when a sheriff's deputy happened upon Steitiye and five others firing guns at a gravel pit near [[Washougal, Washington]]. He was convicted in June, 2002 for weapons and fraud charges, and sentenced to two and one half years in prison. He was also listed in an indictment against [[the Portland Seven]] as an unindicted co-conspirator.

Although his sentence was finished in December 2003, Steitiye was being held pending his deportation to [[Lebanon]], where he planned to join his family. In March 2004, a secret indictment hand up new charges against Steitiye, stating that he illegally possessed a machine gun, and being an ex-convict in possession of a weapon.

'''[[Earnest James Ujaama]]''' was arrested July 22, 2002 on a material witness charge, and later indicted for providing material resources to al-Qaeda. He later pleaded guilty and received a two-year sentence, and in return provided information on terrorist activities.

'''[[Brandon Mayfield]]''' was arrested May 6, 2004 on a material witness charge, on the basis of a fingerprint found after the [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks]]. Although [[Spain|Spanish]] authorities were doubtful that the identification was correct, he was held for two weeks until they conclusively identified the fingerprint as belonging to another man.

==Alleged abuses as a result of detentions==
{{See also|Detainee abuse}}
* Holding some detainees for prolonged periods without charges
* Impeding their access to counsel
* Coercive interrogations
* Overriding judicial orders to release them on bond during immigration proceedings.
* Some detainees were [[physical abuse|physically]] and [[verbal abuse|verbally]] abused because of their national origin or religion.
* Violating the IV Amendment of the Bill Of Rights.

White House Counsel [[Alberto Gonzales]] in a January 2002 memorandum to president Bush recommended that the Bush administration not apply the [[Geneva Conventions]] to al-Qaida and Taliban detainees.  In this way, the president and other U.S. officials could also avoid potential prosecution under the [[War Crimes Act of 1996]], a federal law that makes it a crime, in some cases punishable by death, to [[mistreat]] detainees in violation of the Geneva Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |date=September 23, 2006 |title=Free archived version |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0923-22.htm |accessdate=2006-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
After 9/11 happened, many Muslims were targeted by government officials and many were falsely labeled terrorists. According to author Irum Shiekh, of ''[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2012/05/01/book-review-detained-without-cause-muslims-stories-of-detention-and-deportation-in-america-after-911-by-irum-shiekh/ Detained Without a Cause]'', immigration officials began categorizing certain Muslims as "Special Interest Cases" in which they were deemed as potential terrorists for one reason or another. An example of this targeting that may not have been fair would be to look at how 33% of people targeted were from Pakistan when none of the hijackers of the planes were from Pakistan. A majority of the arrests were also from the New York area, rather than other predominately Muslim areas. If a person were to commit an immigration violation, such as overstaying a visa, then they had a chance of being targeted by government officials of being potential terrorists. Instead of using statistics and looking towards Muslim communities for information, these officials often used racial profiling in order to figure out if a person was a suspect and these biases caused mayhem for these people accused.

'''Eduardo Blanco''' (1838–1912), Venezuelan writer and politician, was aide-de-camp to General [[José Antonio Páez]], independence hero and first president of Venezuela after the breakup of [[Gran Colombia]] in 1830.

==Biography==
[[File:Gen Ramon Tello Mendoza Dr Eduardo Blanco.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. Eduardo Blanco (on right) with General Ramon Tello Mendoza while in the Government of [[Cipriano Castro]].]]
His main work is ''[[Venezuela Heroica]]'' (1881), a classic romantic view of history as an epic. ''Venezuela heroica'' is structured in five vignettes that depict the main battles and heroes of the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]]. It was from General Páez himself that Blanco heard the stories of the [[Battle of Carabobo]], during an encounter with Marshal [[Juan Crisóstomo Falcón]] to end the [[Federal War]] (1859–1863) near the site of the battle. Páez was so moved from his memories of youth, the anecdote goes, that he could not stop telling his aide the details of the battle. It was Falcón who then told Blanco "you are listening to the ''[[Iliad]]'' from the very lips of Achilles".

Blanco is also the author of ''Zárate'' (1882), a historical novel that attempts to make sense of national reality; ''Zárate'' marks the beginning of the "criollista" movement in Venezuelan literature.

Eduado Blanco was minister of foreign affairs for the government of [[Cipriano Castro]] (1899–1908).

==Family and legacy==
He is an uncle of [[Rufino Blanco-Fombona]] and great-great-grandfather of [[María Corina Machado]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21150">The '''European Association of History Educators''' (EUROCLIO) was established in 1992 with the support of the [[Council of Europe]]. The [[NGO]] works as a European wide facilitator for innovation and progress in history Education. The organisation contributes not only to the development, but also on the actual implementation of regional, national and European long-term projects, which focus on establishing knowledge, experience and expertise in the countries by training and consulting teachers. EUROCLIO develops teaching materials, builds and maintains professional Networks and acts as advisor to governments, international organisations, [[NGO]]s, History Teacher Associations and other Organisations. EUROCLIO is supported by the [[Europe for Citizens]] Programme of the European Union and has, for many years, Official Participatory Status and is part of the [[European Union|EU]] Stake Holder's Network in Education and Training.

== Background ==

=== History ===
EUROCLIO was officially founded in 1993, but already in 1992, delegates from [[Denmark]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], [[Portugal]], [[Hungary]], [[Estonia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Finland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] (14 countries), representing 18 history Teachers Associations decided that a European organization was needed to support the learning and teaching of history by sharing and exchanging knowledge and professional experience. EUROCLIO was founded by [[Joke van der Leeuw-Roord]]. The immediate cause for the foundation of such an institute was the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989 and the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1992. These events changed the scope and perspective of history and history education in Europe completely and for many countries, a European dimension in history education suddenly became possible and important for the future. History education is frequently used as a vehicle for political [[propaganda]], hatred and aggression, but now the decision was made to renew contacts between East and West and reinforce a history education that could act as a tool to foster integration, peace and stability in Europe. From 1993 on, EUROCLIO grew rapidly and today it represents 64 member organizations from 46 (mostly) European countries, connecting 40,000 historians and history educators in primary, secondary and higher educational institutes.

== The organisation ==

=== Mission  ===

The organization supports the development of responsible and innovative history, heritage and citizenship education by promoting critical thinking, mutual respect, peace, stability and democracy.

EUROCLIO focuses on three target areas:
* Intense professional capacity building and knowledge exchange, with a focus on the development of innovative and responsible high quality teaching professionals and the development and implementation of contemporary, class-room applicable teaching materials.
*  Dialogue, national, cross-community and trans-border networking and dissemination of information with the goal of maintaining and extending this network through all means available.
* Developing participatory and sustainable, professional civil society networks by establishing and empowering independent History Educators Associations in all European countries and beyond. These organisations act as multipliers of the EUROCLIO work on national levels.

== Activities ==

=== Teacher Training and Conferences ===

Each year, EUROCLIO organises an International Training and Development Course where, on average, History Educators from more than 35 countries meet, learn and discuss a variety of topics and good practice to broaden their perspectives. These Annual Conferences take place in different countries and in close co-operation with local History Teachers’ Associations. In 2009, the Conference was in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]], on the theme “Taking the Perspective of the Others: Intercultural Dialogue and History Teaching”. This Conference is co-organised by nine Teacher Unions and History Educators’ Associations from across the divide.

All EUROCLIO Teacher Training activities are in close co-operation with both local academics and institutes for history teacher education, and international experts to train history teachers how to use the most modern teaching methods in their classes. For example: history educators everywhere recognise the importance of ICT as a learning and communications tool, and want further training in how to develop these areas and how to extend their skills in using ICT to promote historical understanding and learning. EUROCLIO operates through the medium of English for international work, and in home languages with translations for the experts supporting projects and in developmental work.

Since its foundation, EUROCLIO has organised more than 30 International Conferences and more than 70 National and Regional Training and Development Courses.

=== Programmes ===

EUROCLIO implements several long term programmes:
* '''International Trainings''' provides cross-border professional capacity building for history, heritage and citizenship educators related to innovative and responsible history education.
* '''Historiana - Your Portal to the Past''' promotes digital literacy through history, heritage and citizenship education by means of an on-line multimedia tool, offering students multi-perspective, cross-border and comparative historical resources supplementing their national history teaching tools.
* '''History that Connects in the Western Balkans''' restores the professional relations between history, heritage and citizenship educators and explores opportunities for a collaborative approach to teaching history in the region, including sensitive and controversial issues.
* '''Mediterranean Dialogues''' enables educators across the Euro-Mediterranean region to open a common dialogue, to share experiences and to develop cross-community and cross-border cooperation and networks.
* '''Innovating History Education in the Black Sea Region''' raises awareness in this region for approaches in history, heritage and citizenship education, which enhance democracy and intercultural dialogue and is creating sustainable national and cross border networks.

The [[Epigraphy#Greek_inscriptions|Greek-language inscription]]s and [[epigraphy]] are a major source for understanding of the society and history of ancient Greece and other Greek-speaking or Greek-controlled areas.

==Inscriptiones Graecae==
{{main|Inscriptiones Graecae}}
The ''Inscriptiones Graecae'' (IG), [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Greek inscriptions'', project is an academic project originally begun by the [[Prussian Academy of Science]], and today continued by its successor organisation, the ''Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften''. Its aim is to collect and publish all known [[ancient]] [[inscriptions]] from the ancient world. As such it will eventually make all other previous collections redundant.

==Other printed collections==

'''Götz Haydar Aly''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡœts ˈʔaːliː|lang}}; born May 3, 1947) is a German [[journalist]], [[historian]] and [[political scientist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/der-tag-mit-goetz-aly-schwieriger-neuanfang-fuer-die-spd.2950.de.html?dram:article_id=424246|title=Der Tag mit Götz Aly  - Schwieriger Neuanfang für die SPD|work=Deutschlandfunk Kultur|access-date=2018-09-01|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/research/competitive-academic-programs/fellows-and-scholars/all-fellows-and-scholars/goetz-aly-2002|title=Fellow Dr. Götz Aly — United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ushmm.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Aly was born in [[Heidelberg]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]. He is a patrilineal descendant of a Turkish convert to Christianity named Friedrich Christian (Haydar) Aly who was a chamberlain at the [[Prussian court]] in the late 1600s. By family tradition, the oldest son gets the middle name 'Haydar'. He sees himself as an ethnic German except for the accident of his name. (See the [[:de:Götz Aly|German version of this article]].)

After attending the [[Deutsche Journalistenschule]], Aly studied [[history]] and [[political science]] in [[Berlin]]. As a journalist, he worked for the [[die tageszeitung|taz]], the [[Berliner Zeitung]] and the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|FAZ]]. Active in the leftist [[German student movement]] in the late 60s and early 70s, he has published a polemic retrospective book " Unser Kampf. 1968 – Ein irritierter Blick zurück" (Fischer TB, Frankfurt/Main 2009) in which he argues the radical students of the time had more in common with the "1933 generation" than they realize.

He obtained his [[Habilitation]] in political science at the [[Free University of Berlin]] in 1994 with a dissertation on the [[Aktion T4|Nazi euthanasia of disabled children]]. His interest in the subject was initially sparked when his infant daughter incurred severe permanent brain damage from a [[meningitis]] infection.
From 2004 to 2005, he was a visiting [[professor]] for interdisciplinary [[Holocaust]] research at the [[Fritz Bauer Institut]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and 2012-3 at the Institute for Contemporary History at the [[University of Vienna]]. He has also been a visiting researcher at [[Yad Vashem]].

==Work==
Aly researches the history of the [[Holocaust]] and the participation of social elites in [[Nazism|Nazi]] destruction policies. In 2005 he gained public attention in Germany for the popular success of his book ''[[Hitlers Volksstaat]]'' (''Hitler's People's State''). In it, Aly characterises [[Nazi Germany]] as a "convenience dictatorship" that until late in [[World War II]] retained broad public support, in particular by making possible an unprecedented [[social mobility]] for the lower classes, by introducing redistributive [[Taxes|fiscal policies]] and by greatly extending the German [[welfare state]]. Aly also recounts how all this was paid for in large part by confiscation of Jewish property in Germany and later the plunder of the conquered countries, and especially their Jewish populations. He maintains that the reason for the massive support the Nazi regime enjoyed among the German population was not so much a consequence of their violent anti-Semitism as their enjoying the fruits of the loot acquired by the Nazis in the occupied territories. He also shows how the Wehrmacht was directly involved in this mass plunder of the conquered populations and how in many cases it was the initiator of policies which led to confiscation and eventual extermination. His other point is that the conservative, non-Nazi financial state bureaucracy and the leading banks were crucial in formulating this policy of mass plunder and murder.

Also, in his book '''Final Solution': Nazi Population Policy and the Murder of the European Jews'', Aly argues that those of lower rank influenced the leadership to the [[Final Solution]]. This approach is what is known as the [[bottom-up approach of the Holocaust]].

Aly's views have not remained without criticism from the mainstream of historical research.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[Adam Tooze]], in particular, rejected Aly's argumentation in detailed analysis published in the German press.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Aly's work was rewarded by the [[Heinrich-Mann-Preis]] in 2002 and the [[Marion-Samuel-Preis]] one year later.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4302">'''Henri Joly''' (1866–1945) was a French inventor and businessman. He developed early versions of motion picture film, cameras, and projectors.

==Biography==
Joly was born in Viomenil, Vosges in 1866. By 1889 he was a gymnastics instructor at the school of Joinville, and was introduced to the nascent moving-picture technology when pioneers [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] and [[Georges Demenÿ]] (who was also a gymnast) came there to make motion-picture studies. Joly became acquainted with the Edison [[Kinetoscope]] when it was publicly introduced in Paris in 1894. In 1895 Joly met [[Charles Pathé]], a Vincennes merchant who sold [[phonograph]]s, who began importing pirated Kinetoscopes (made by [[Robert W. Paul]] in England) in May 1895.

==Film-related career==
The short "movies" presented on the early Kinetoscopes had little variety, and they rapidly wore out. As Joly became aware of these shortcomings, he offered to make a camera for Pathé that could be used to reproduce the Kinetoscope films. Pathé agreed to fund the development, and on 26 August 1895, Joly filed a patent application for a camera that could provide films both for a projector and for the Kinetoscope. The camera used a mechanical movement similar to that in the Demenÿ system, and utilized perforated film which could be advanced on mechanical sprockets. He made his first moving picture, titled ''Le Bain d'une Mondaine'' in September–October of that year.
On 8 October 1895 Joly filed a patent for another machine, the "Photozootrope", which was essentially a large Kinetoscope with four eyepieces. He sold a few units, but did not achieve major success with this development.

Pathé realized the commercial possibility of Joly's camera, and in 1896 he dissolved his agreement with Joly. He managed to secure the rights to the camera and the film process, going on to great success in the motion picture world.
During 1896 Joly filed three other patent applications: the first for another camera; the second for a method of eliminating "flicker" from the projected image; and the third for a method of adding the perception of depth to the filmed image.
During the final years of the decade Joly teamed with a French businessman and engineer, Ernest Normandin, to make and exhibit motion pictures. The process, officially called ''[[Joly-Normandin]]'' but also billed first as ''Cinematographe Joly'', and then as ''Royal Biograph'', was being exhibited at the Bazar de la Charité in 1897 when a disastrous fire (caused by a Molteni ether lamp) occurred. It was later exhibited in England (at the Empire in Leicester Square), and in Ireland (billed as "Professor Jolly's Cinematograph").
[[File:Phonographes &amp; Cinématographes Lux 1906.jpg|thumb| Share of the Société des Phonographes et Cinématographes Lux, issued 5. November 1906]]
In 1900 Joly entered a three-way partnership with Normandin and his brother Edgar, called "Société du Biophonographe", to exploit a system of synchronizing a motion picture projection with sound from a phonograph. The company filmed and marketed several films, but declared insolvency in 1902. Joly sold the rights to his patents to Georges Mendel, who continued developing them into a commercially viable talking film. Joly created another company in 1906, the ''Société des Phonographes et Cinématographes Lux'', which produced several short films. He left the company in 1908 after disagreements with other principals, continuing his research alone.

One line of research into recording sound for films involved a beam light reflected from a mirror which vibrated in response to sound waves. He had formulated the concept in 1905, but was never able to develop the machines necessary for its utilization. Unable to achieve commercial success, he supported himself by working in various manufacturing plants. By the time of his death in 1945 in Paris, he was a night watchman, and died unnoticed and destitute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorian-cinema.net/joly.htm Who's Who of Victorian Cinema entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hildegard was elected ''[[:wiktionary:magistra|magistra]]'' by her fellow nuns in 1136; she founded the monasteries of [[Rupertsberg]] in 1150 and [[Eibingen Abbey|Eibingen]] in 1165. One of her works as a composer, the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'', is an early example of liturgical drama and arguably the oldest surviving [[morality play]].&lt;ref&gt;Some writers have speculated a distant origin for opera in this piece, though without any evidence.

Although the history of her formal consideration is complicated, she has been recognized as a saint by branches of the Roman Catholic Church for centuries. On 7 October 2012, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] named her a [[Doctor of the Church]].&lt;!-- no need for citations here, save that for the detail section below --&gt;

==Biography==

Hildegard was born around the year 1098, although the exact date is uncertain. Her parents were Mechtild of Merxheim-Nahet and Hildebert of Bermersheim, a family of the free lower nobility in the service of the Count Meginhard of [[County of Sponheim|Sponheim]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), 40; Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Sickly from birth, Hildegard is traditionally considered their youngest and tenth child,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gies |first1=Frances |last2=Gies |first2=Joseph |title=Women in the Middle Ages |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-06-464037-4 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are records of only seven older siblings.&lt;ref&gt;''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), pp. 278–79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Bowie, Oliver Davies. ''Hildegard of Bingen: An Anthology''. SPCK 1990. Some sources note younger siblings, specifically Bruno.&lt;/ref&gt; In her ''Vita'', Hildegard states that from a very young age she had experienced [[vision (religion)|visions]].&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 2002"&gt;''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p. 138; Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monastic life===
Perhaps because of Hildegard's visions, or as a method of political positioning (or both), Hildegard's parents offered her as an [[oblate]] to the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery at the [[Disibodenberg]], which had been recently reformed in the [[Palatinate Forest]]. The date of Hildegard's enclosure at the monastery is the subject of debate. Her ''[[Hagiography|Vita]]'' says she was professed with an older woman, [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], the daughter of Count Stephan II of Sponheim, at the age of eight.&lt;ref&gt;''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jutta's date of enclosure is known to have been in 1112, when Hildegard would have been fourteen.&lt;ref&gt;''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), pp. 52–55, 69; and John Van Engen, "Abbess: 'Mother and Teacher', in Barbara Newman, ed., ''Voice of the Living Light'' (California: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 30–51, at pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Their vows were received by Bishop Otto Bamberg on All Saints' Day, 1112. Some scholars speculate that Hildegard was placed in the care of Jutta at the age of eight, and the two women were then enclosed together six years later.&lt;ref&gt;Michael McGrade, "Hildegard von Bingen", in ''Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart: allgemeine Enzyklopaldie der Musik,'' 2nd edition, T.2, Vol. 8, ed. Ludwig Fischer (Kassel and New York: Bahrenreiter, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, Hildegard and Jutta were enclosed together at the Disibodenberg, and formed the core of a growing community of women attached to the male monastery. Jutta was also a visionary and thus attracted many followers who came to visit her at the cloister. Hildegard tells us that Jutta taught her to read and write, but that she was unlearned and therefore incapable of teaching Hildegard sound biblical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The written record of the ''Life of Jutta'' indicates that Hildegard probably assisted her in reciting the psalms, working in the garden and other handiwork, and tending to the sick.&lt;ref&gt;''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), pp. 70-73; Reed-Jones, Carol. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Women of Vision'' (Washington: Paper Crane Press, 2004), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This might have been a time when Hildegard learned how to play the ten-stringed [[psaltery]]. [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]], a frequent visitor, may have taught Hildegard simple psalm notation. The time she studied music could have been the beginning of the compositions she would later create.&lt;ref&gt;Reed-Jones, Carol. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Women of Vision'' (Washington: Paper Crane Press, 2004), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Jutta's death in 1136, Hildegard was unanimously elected as ''magistra'' of the community by her fellow nuns.&lt;ref&gt;Furlong, Monica. ''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg asked Hildegard to be [[Prioress]], which would be under his authority. Hildegard, however, wanted more independence for herself and her nuns, and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to [[Rupertsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Furlong, Monica. ''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of [[Archbishop Henry I of Mainz]]. Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to a new location in Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery.&lt;ref&gt;McGrade, "Hildegard", ''MGG.''&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]] served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe. In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at [[Eibingen Abbey|Eibingen]].

Before Hildegard's death, a problem arose with the clergy of Mainz. A man buried in Rupertsburg had died after excommunication from the Church. Therefore, the clergy wanted to remove his body from the sacred ground. Hildegard did not accept this idea, replying that it was a sin and that the man had been reconciled to the church at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Sabina. ''Hildegard of Bingen, 1098–1179: a visionary life'' (London: Routledge, 1989), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visions===

Hildegard said that she first saw "The Shade of the Living Light" at the age of three, and by the age of five she began to understand that she was experiencing visions.&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, Evelyn. ''Mystics of the Church'' (Pennsylvania: Morehouse Publishing, 1925), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; She used the term 'visio' (the Latin for "vision") to describe this feature of her experience, and recognized that it was a gift that she could not explain to others. Hildegard explained that she saw all things in the light of God through the five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.&lt;ref&gt;Schipperges, Heinrich. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Healing and the Nature of the Cosmos'' (New Jersey: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1997), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard was hesitant to share her visions, confiding only to [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], who in turn told Volmar, Hildegard's tutor and, later, secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout her life, she continued to have many visions, and in 1141, at the age of 42, Hildegard received a vision she believed to be an instruction from God, to "write down that which you see and hear."&lt;ref&gt;Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Still hesitant to record her visions, Hildegard became physically ill. The illustrations recorded in the book of Scivias were visions that Hildegard experienced, causing her great suffering and tribulations.&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, Evelyn. ''Mystics of the Church'' (Pennsylvania: Morehouse Publishing, 1925), pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; In her first theological text, ''[[Scivias]]'' ("Know the Ways"), Hildegard describes her struggle within:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But I, though I saw and heard these things, refused to write for a long time through doubt and bad opinion and the diversity of human words, not with stubbornness but in the exercise of humility, until, laid low by the scourge of God, I fell upon a bed of sickness; then, compelled at last by many illnesses, and by the witness of a certain noble maiden of good conduct [the nun Richardis von Stade] and of that man whom I had secretly sought and found, as mentioned above, I set my hand to the writing. While I was doing it, I sensed, as I mentioned before, the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close – though just barely – in ten years. (...) And I spoke and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places. And again I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 'Cry out therefore, and write thus!'&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard von Bingen, ''Scivias,'' trans. by Columba Hart and Jane Bishop with an Introduction by Barbara J. Newman, and Preface by Caroline Walker Bynum (New York: Paulist Press, 1990), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was between November 1147 and February 1148 at the synod in Trier that [[Pope Eugene III|Pope Eugenius]] heard about Hildegard's writings. It was from this that she received Papal approval to document her visions as revelations from the Holy Spirit giving her instant credence.

On 17 September 1179, when Hildegard died, her sisters claimed they saw two streams of light appear in the skies and cross over the room where she was dying.&lt;ref name="Madigan, Shawn 1998"/&gt;

Several manuscripts of her works were produced during her lifetime, including the illustrated Rupertsberg manuscript of her first major work, ''[[Scivias]]'' (lost since 1945); the [[Dendermonde Codex]], which contains one version of her musical works; and the Ghent manuscript, which was the first fair-copy made for editing of her final theological work, the ''[[Liber Divinorum Operum]]''. At the end of her life, and probably under her initial guidance, all of her works were edited and gathered into the single [http://www.hs-rm.de/hlb/suchen-finden/sondersammlungen/handschriften-inkunabeln-alte-drucke/der-riesencodex-hildegard-von-bingen/index.html Riesenkodex manuscript].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Derolez, "The Manuscript Transmission of Hildegard of Bingen's Writings," in ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Context of her Thought and Art'', ed.

===Visionary theology===
Hildegard's most significant works were her three volumes of visionary theology: ''[[Scivias]]'' ("Know the Ways", composed 1142–1151), ''Liber Vitae Meritorum'' ("Book of Life's Merits" or "Book of the Rewards of Life", composed 1158–1163); and ''Liber Divinorum Operum'' ("Book of Divine Works", also known as ''De operatione Dei'', "On God's Activity", composed 1163/4–1172 or 1174). In these volumes, the last of which was completed when she was well into her seventies, Hildegard first describes each vision, whose details are often strange and enigmatic, and then interprets their theological contents in the words of the "voice of the Living Light."

====''Scivias''====
[[File:Meister des Hildegardis-Codex 004.jpg|thumb|left|The Church, the Bride of Christ and Mother of the Faithful in Baptism. Illustration to ''Scivias'' II.3, fol. 51r from the 20th-century facsimile of the Rupertsberg manuscript, c. 1165–1180]]
The composition of the first work, ''[[Scivias]]'', was triggered by the insistence of her visionary experiences in about 1142, when she was already forty-three years old. Perceiving a divine command to "write down what you see and hear",&lt;ref&gt;"Protestificatio" ("Declaration") to Hildegard of Bingen, ''Scivias'', trans. Mother Columba Hart and Jane Bishop (Paulist Press, 1990), pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard began to record her visionary experiences. ''[[Scivias]]'' is structured into three parts of unequal length. The first part (six visions) chronicles the order of God's creation: the Creation and Fall of Adam and Eve, the structure of the universe (famously described as the shape of an "egg"), the relationship between body and soul, God's relationship to his people through the Synagogue, and the choirs of angels. The second part (seven visions) describes the order of redemption: the coming of Christ the Redeemer, the [[Trinity]], the Church as the Bride of Christ and the Mother of the Faithful in [[baptism]] and [[confirmation]], the orders of the Church, Christ's sacrifice on the Cross and the [[Eucharist]], and the fight against the devil. Finally, the third part (thirteen visions) recapitulates the history of salvation told in the first two parts, symbolized as a building adorned with various allegorical figures and virtues. It concludes with the Symphony of Heaven, an early version of Hildegard's musical compositions.

Portions of the uncompleted work were read aloud to [[Pope Eugenius III]] at the Synod of Trier in 1148, after which he sent Hildegard a letter with his blessing.&lt;ref&gt;Letter 4 in ''The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen'', trans. Joseph L. Baird and Radd K. Ehrman (Oxford University Press, 1994), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; This blessing was later construed as papal approval for all of Hildegard's wide-ranging theological activities.&lt;ref&gt;Van Engen, John. "Letters and the Public Persona of Hildegard," in ''Hildegard von Bingen in ihrem historischen Umfeld'', ed. Alfred Haverkamp (Mainz: Trierer Historische Forschungen, 2000), pp. 375–418; and Kathryn Kerby-Fulton, "Hildegard of Bingen", in ''Medieval Holy Women in the Christian Tradition'', c. 1100–c. 1500, ed. Alastair Minnis and Rosalynn Voaden (Turnhout: Brepols, 2010), pp. 343–69, at pp. 350–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of her life, Hildegard commissioned a richly decorated manuscript of ''[[Scivias]]'' (the Rupertsberg Codex); although the original has been lost since its evacuation to Dresden for safekeeping in 1945, its images are preserved in a hand-painted facsimile from the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Rupertsberg MS images" /&gt;

====''Liber Vitae Meritorum''====
In her second volume of visionary theology, composed between 1158 and 1163, after she had moved her community of nuns into independence at the Rupertsberg in Bingen, Hildegard tackled the moral life in the form of dramatic confrontations between the virtues and the vices. She had already explored this area in her musical morality play, ''Ordo Virtutum'', and the "Book of the Rewards of Life" takes up that play's characteristic themes. Each vice, although ultimately depicted as ugly and grotesque, nevertheless offers alluring, seductive speeches that attempt to entice the unwary soul into their clutches. Standing in our defense, however, are the sober voices of the Virtues, powerfully confronting every vicious deception.&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard of Bingen. ''The Book of the Rewards of Life''. Trans. Bruce W. Hozeski (Oxford University Press), 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the work's innovations is one of the earliest descriptions of purgatory as the place where each soul would have to work off its debts after death before entering heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Barbara. "Hildegard of Bingen and the 'Birth of Purgatory'," ''Mystics Quarterly'' 19 (1993): 90–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard's descriptions of the possible punishments there are often gruesome and grotesque, which emphasize the work's moral and pastoral purpose as a practical guide to the life of true penance and proper virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Barbara. "'Sibyl of the Rhine': Hildegard's Life and Times," in ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed. Barbara Newman (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 1–29, at pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Liber Divinorum Operum''====
&lt;!--[[Liber Divinorum Operum]] redirects here--&gt;
[[File:Hildegard von Bingen Liber Divinorum Operum.jpg|thumb|right|"Universal Man" illumination from Hildegard's ''Liber Divinorum Operum'', I.2. Lucca, MS 1942, early 13th-century copy.]]
Hildegard's last and grandest visionary work had its genesis in one of the few times she experienced something like an ecstatic loss of consciousness. As she described it in an autobiographical passage included in her Vita, sometime in about 1163, she received "an extraordinary mystical vision" in which was revealed the "sprinkling drops of sweet rain" that [[John the Evangelist]] experienced when he wrote, "In the beginning was the Word..." (John 1:1). Hildegard perceived that this Word was the key to the "Work of God", of which humankind is the pinnacle. The ''Book of Divine Works'', therefore, became in many ways an extended explication of the Prologue to John's Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;"The Life of Hildegard", II.16, in ''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), 179; Dronke, Peter. ''Women Writers of the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 162–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten visions of this work's three parts are cosmic in scale, to illustrate various ways of understanding the relationship between God and his creation. Often, that relationship is established by grand allegorical female figures representing Divine Love (''Caritas'') or Wisdom (''Sapientia''). The first vision opens the work with a salvo of poetic and visionary images, swirling about to characterize God's dynamic activity within the scope of his work within the history of salvation. The remaining three visions of the first part introduce the famous image of a human being standing astride the spheres that make up the universe, and detail the intricate relationships between the human as microcosm and the universe as macrocosm. This culminates in the final chapter of Part One, Vision Four with Hildegard's commentary on the Prologue to John's Gospel (John 1:1-14), a direct rumination on the meaning of "In the beginning was the Word..." The single vision that comprises the whole of Part Two stretches that rumination back to the opening of Genesis, and forms an extended commentary on the seven days of the creation of the world told in Genesis 1-2:3. This commentary interprets each day of creation in three ways: literal or cosmological; allegorical or ecclesiological (i.e. related to the Church's history); and moral or tropological (i.e. related to the soul's growth in virtue). Finally, the five visions of the third part take up again the building imagery of ''Scivias'' to describe the course of salvation history. The final vision (3.5) contains Hildegard's longest and most detailed prophetic program of the life of the Church from her own days of "womanish weakness" through to the coming and ultimate downfall of the Antichrist.&lt;ref&gt;St. Hildegard of Bingen, [https://www.hfsbooks.com/catalog/title/?isbn=9780813231297 ''The Book of Divine Works''], trans. Nathaniel M. Campbell (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 2018). {{ISBN|9780813231297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Attention in recent decades to women of the medieval [[Catholic Church|Church]] has led to a great deal of popular interest in Hildegard's music. In addition to the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]],'' sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive, and at least four other texts are known, though their musical notation has been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard of Bingen. ''Symphonia'', ed. Barbara Newman (2nd Ed.; Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers.

{{Listen|filename=O frondens 2.ogg|title=''O frondens virga''|format=[[Ogg]]}}
One of her better known works, ''Ordo Virtutum'' (''Play of the Virtues''), is a [[morality play]]. It is uncertain when some of Hildegard's compositions were composed, though the ''Ordo Virtutum'' is thought to have been composed as early as 1151.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Sabina. ''Hildegard of Bingen, 1098–1179: A Visionary Life'' (London: Routledge, 1989), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The morality play consists of [[monophony|monophonic]] melodies for the Anima (human soul) and 16 [[Virtues]]. There is also one speaking part for the Devil. Scholars assert that the role of the Devil would have been played by Volmar, while Hildegard's nuns would have played the parts of Anima and the Virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Ekdahl Davidson. "Music and Performance: Hildegard of Bingen's Ordo Virtutum." ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies'', (Kalamazoo, MI: Western Michigan University, 1992), pp. 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ''Ordo Virtutum'', Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum''. The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard's own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Her music is described as [[monophony|monophonic]], that is, consisting of exactly one melodic line.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Barbara. ''Voice of the Living Light'' (California: University of California Press, 1998), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Its style is characterized by soaring melodies that can push the boundaries of the more staid ranges of traditional Gregorian chant. Though Hildegard's music is often thought to stand outside the normal practices of monophonic monastic chant,&lt;ref name="holsinger"/&gt; current researchers are also exploring ways in which it may be viewed in comparison with her contemporaries, such as [[Hermannus Contractus]].&lt;ref&gt;See Jennifer Bain, "Hildegard, Hermannus and Late Chant Style," ''Journal of Music Theory'', 2008, vol. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Another feature of Hildegard's music that both reflects twelfth-century evolutions of chant and pushes those evolutions further is that it is highly [[melismatic]], often with recurrent melodic units. Scholars such as [[Margot Fassler]], Marianne Richert Pfau, and Beverly Lomer also note the intimate relationship between music and text in Hildegard's compositions, whose rhetorical features are often more distinct than is common in twelfth-century chant.&lt;ref&gt;Margot Fassler. "Composer and Dramatist: 'Melodious Singing and the Freshness of Remorse,'" ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed. Barbara Newman (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), 149–75; Marianna Richert-Pfau, "Mode and Melody Types in Hildegard von Bingen's Symphonia," ''Sonus'' 11 (1990): 53–71; Beverly Lomer, ''Music, Rhetoric and the Sacred Feminine'' (Saarbrücken, Germany: Verlag Dr. Müller, 2009) and eadem, "Hildegard of Bingen: Music, Rhetoric and the Divine Feminine," in ''Journal of the International Alliance of Women and Music'', vol. 18, No. 2, 2012. See also Lomer's discussion of "The Theory and Rhetoric of Hildegard's Music," in the International Society for Hildegard von Bingen Studies' [http://www.hildegard-society.org/p/music.html#Theory_and_Rhetoric online edition of Hildegard's ''Symphonia''].&lt;/ref&gt; As with all medieval chant notation, Hildegard's music lacks any indication of tempo or rhythm; the surviving manuscripts employ late German style notation, which uses very ornamental [[neumes]].&lt;ref&gt;See the facsimile of her music now freely available on [http://imslp.org/wiki/Symphonia_et_Ordo_virtutum_%28Hildegard%29 IMSLP].&lt;/ref&gt; The reverence for the Virgin Mary reflected in music shows how deeply influenced and inspired Hildegard of Bingen and her community were by the Virgin Mary and the saints.&lt;ref&gt;Butcher, Carmen Acevedo. ''Hildegard of Bingen: A Spiritual Reader'' (Massachusetts: Paraclete Press, 2007), p. 27; see also Beverly Lomer, "Hildegard of Bingen: Music, Rhetoric and the Divine Feminine," in ''Journal of the International Alliance of Women and Music'', vol. 18, No. 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of [[viriditas]] or "greenness" is an earthly expression of the heavenly in an integrity that overcomes dualisms. This greenness or power of life appears frequently in Hildegard's works.&lt;ref&gt;Madigan, Shawn. ''Mystics, Visionaries and Prophets: A Historical Anthology of Women's Spiritual Writings'' (Minnesota: Augsburg Fortress, 1998), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Hildegard's self-professed view that her compositions have as object the praise of God, one scholar has asserted that Hildegard made a close association between music and the female body in her musical compositions.&lt;ref name="holsinger"&gt;Holsinger, Bruce. "The Flesh of the Voice: Embodiment and the Homoerotics of Devotion in the Music of Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179),"Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society 19 (Autumn, 1993): pp. 92–125.&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the poetry and music of Hildegard's Symphonia would therefore be concerned with the anatomy of female desire thus described as Sapphonic, or pertaining to [[Sappho]], connecting her to a history of female rhetoricians.&lt;ref&gt;Holsinger, Bruce W. Music, Body, and Desire in Medieval Culture. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. pp. 123–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific and medicinal writings===
[[File:Hildegard of bingen and nuns.jpg|thumb|Hildegard of Bingen and her nuns]]
Hildegard's medicinal and scientific writings, though thematically complementary to her ideas about nature expressed in her visionary works, are different in focus and scope. Neither claim to be rooted in her visionary experience and its divine authority. Rather, they spring from her experience helping in and then leading the monastery's herbal garden and infirmary, as well as the theoretical information she likely gained through her wide-ranging reading in the monastery's library.&lt;ref name=Glaze&gt;Florence Eliza Glaze, "Medical Writer: 'Behold the Human Creature,'" in ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed. Barbara Newman (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 125–48.&lt;/ref&gt; As she gained practical skills in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, she combined physical treatment of physical diseases with holistic methods centered on "spiritual healing."&lt;ref name=Sweet&gt;Sweet, V. (1999). "Hildegard of Bingen and the greening of medieval medicine." ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'', 73(3), pp. 381–403. ''Project MUSE'', doi:10.1353/bhm.1999.0140&lt;/ref&gt; She became well known for her healing powers involving practical application of tinctures, herbs, and precious stones.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; She combined these elements with a theological notion ultimately derived from Genesis: all things put on earth are for the use of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Hozeski, Bruce W. ''Hildegard's Healing Plants: From Her Medieval Classic Physica'' (Massachusetts: Beacon Press, 2001), pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her hands-on experience, she also gained medical knowledge, including elements of her humoral theory, from traditional Latin texts.&lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt;

Hildegard catalogued both her theory and practice in two works. The first, ''Physica,'' contains nine books that describe the scientific and medicinal properties of various plants, stones, fish, reptiles, and animals. The second, ''Causae et Curae'', is an exploration of the human body, its connections to the rest of the natural world, and the causes and cures of various diseases.&lt;ref name="medical"&gt;Hildegard von Bingen, ''Causae et Curae (Holistic Healing)'', trans. by Manfred Pawlik and Patrick Madigan, ed. by Mary Palmquist and John Kulas (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, Inc., 1994); Hildegard von Bingen, ''Physica'', trans. Priscilla Throop (Rochester, Vermont: Healing Arts Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard documented various medical practices in these books, including the use of bleeding and home remedies for many common ailments. She also explains remedies for common agricultural injuries such as burns, fractures, dislocations, and cuts.&lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt; Hildegard may have used the books to teach assistants at the monastery. These books are historically significant because they show areas of medieval medicine that were not well documented because their practitioners (mainly women) rarely wrote in Latin. Her writings were commentated on by [[Mélanie Lipinska]], a Polish scientist&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Old Time Makers of Medicine|last=Walsh|first=James|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=1911|isbn=|location=New York|pages=194–201|via=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its wealth of practical evidence, ''Causae et Curae'' is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme. Its first part sets the work within the context of the creation of the cosmos and then humanity as its summit, and the constant interplay of the human person as microcosm both physically and spiritually with the macrocosm of the universe informs all of Hildegard's approach.&lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; Her hallmark is to emphasize the vital connection between the "green" health of the natural world and the holistic health of the human person. ''Viriditas'', or greening power, was thought to sustain human beings and could be manipulated by adjusting the balance of elements within a person.&lt;ref name="Sweet" /&gt; Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy. Rather, Hildegard understood the plants and elements of the garden as direct counterparts to the humors and elements within the human body, whose imbalance led to illness and disease.&lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt;

Thus, the nearly three hundred chapters of the second book of ''Causae et Curae'' "explore the etiology, or causes, of disease as well as human sexuality, psychology, and physiology."&lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; In this section, she give specific instructions for bleeding based on various factors, including gender, the phase of the moon (bleeding is best done when moon is waning), the place of disease (use veins near diseased organ of body part) or prevention (big veins in arms), and how much blood to take (described in imprecise measurements, like "the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp"). She even includes bleeding instructions for animals to keep them healthy. In the third and fourth sections, Hildegard describes treatments for malignant and minor problems and diseases according to the humoral theory, again including information on animal health. The fifth section is about diagnosis and prognosis, which includes instructions to check the patient's blood, pulse, urine and stool.&lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt; Finally, the sixth section documents a lunar horoscope to provide an additional means of prognosis for both disease and other medical conditions, such as conception and the outcome of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; For example, she indicates that a waxing moon is good for human conception and is also good for sowing seeds for plants (sowing seeds is the plant equivalent of conception).&lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt; Elsewhere, Hildegard is even said to have stressed the value of boiling drinking water in an attempt to prevent infection.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;"Hildegard of Bingen." Encyclopedia of World Biography. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Hildegard elaborates the medical and scientific relationship between the human microcosm and the macrocosm of the universe, she often focuses on interrelated patterns of four: "the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth), the four seasons, the four humors, the four zones of the earth, and the four major winds."&lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; Although she inherited the basic framework of [[humorism|humoral theory]] from ancient medicine, Hildegard's conception of the hierarchical inter-balance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) was unique, based on their correspondence to "superior" and "inferior" elements—blood and phlegm corresponding to the "celestial" elements of fire and air, and the two biles corresponding to the "terrestrial" elements of water and earth. Hildegard understood the disease-causing imbalance of these humors to result from the improper dominance of the subordinate humors. This disharmony reflects that introduced by Adam and Eve in the Fall, which for Hildegard marked the indelible entrance of disease and humoral imbalance into humankind.&lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; As she writes in ''Causae et Curae'' c. 42:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It happens that certain men suffer diverse illnesses. This comes from the phlegm which is superabundant within them. For if man had remained in paradise, he would not have had the ''flegmata'' within his body, from which many evils proceed, but his flesh would have been whole and without dark humor [''livor'']. However, because he consented to evil and relinquished good, he was made into a likeness of the earth, which produces good and useful herbs, as well as bad and useless ones, and which has in itself both good and evil moistures. From tasting evil, the blood of the sons of Adam was turned into the poison of semen, out of which the sons of man are begotten. And therefore their flesh is ulcerated and permeable [to disease]. These sores and openings create a certain storm and smoky moisture in men, from which the ''flegmata'' arise and coagulate, which then introduce diverse infirmities to the human body. All this arose from the first evil, which man began at the start, because if Adam had remained in paradise, he would have had the sweetest health, and the best dwelling-place, just as the strongest balsam emits the best odor; but on the contrary, man now has within himself poison and phlegm and diverse illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Glaze, "Medical Writer: 'Behold the Human Creature,'" p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Lingua Ignota'' and invented alphabet===
[[File:Litterae ignotae.png|thumb|right|Alphabet by Hildegard von Bingen, Litterae ignotae, which she used for her language [[Lingua Ignota]]]]

Hildegard also invented an [[constructed script|alternative alphabet]]. The text of her writing and compositions reveals Hildegard's use of this form of modified medieval [[Latin]], encompassing many invented, conflated and abridged words.&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 2002"/&gt; Because of her inventions of words for her lyrics and use of a constructed script, many [[conlang]]ers look upon her as a medieval precursor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkuK53bU4_UC ''Hildegard of Bingen's Unknown Language: An Edition, Translation, and Discussion''], ed. Sarah Higley (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars believe that Hildegard used her ''[[Lingua Ignota]]'' to increase solidarity among her nuns.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara J. Newman, "Introduction" to Hildegard, ''Scivias,'' p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

===During her lifetime===
Maddocks claims that it is likely Hildegard learned simple Latin and the tenets of the Christian faith but was not instructed in the Seven [[Liberal Arts]], which formed the basis of all education for the learned classes in the Middle Ages: the ''[[Trivium (education)|Trivium]]'' of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric plus the ''[[Quadrivium]]'' of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age. New York: Doubleday, 2001. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence she kept with the outside world, both spiritual and social, transcended the cloister as a space of spiritual confinement and served to document Hildegard's grand style and strict formatting of medieval letter writing.&lt;ref name="Dietrich, Julia 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For cloister as confinement see [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04060a.htm "Female" section of "Cloister"] in ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributing to Christian European rhetorical traditions, Hildegard "authorized herself as a theologian" through alternative rhetorical arts.&lt;ref name="Dietrich, Julia 1997"&gt;Dietrich, Julia. "The Visionary Rhetoric of Hildegard of Bingen." ''Listening to their Voices: The Rhetorical Activities of Historic Women'', Molly Meijer Wertheimer, ed. (University of South Carolina Press, 1997), pp. 202–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard was creative in her interpretation of theology. She believed that her monastery should exclude novices who were not from the nobility because she did not want her community to be divided on the basis of social status.&lt;ref&gt;See Hildegard's correspondence with Tengswich of Andernach, in Letters 52 and 52r, in ''The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen, Vol. 1'', trans.Baird and Ehrman (Oxford University Press, 1994), 127–30; and discussion in Alfred Haverkamp, "Tenxwind von Andernach und Hildegard von Bingen: Zwei »Weltanschauungen« in der Mitte des 12. Jahrhunderts," in ''Institutionen, Kultur und Gesellschaft im Mittelalter: Feschrift für Josef Fleckenstein'', ed. Lutz Fenske, Werner Rösener, and Thomas Zotz (Jan Thorbecke Verlag: Sigmaringen, 1984), 515–48; and Peter Dronke, ''Women Writers of the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 165–67.&lt;/ref&gt; She also stated that "woman may be made from man, but no man can be made without a woman."&lt;ref name="Madigan, Shawn 1998"&gt;Madigan, Shawn. Mystics, Visionaries and Prophets: A Historical Anthology of Women's Spiritual Writings (Minnesota: Augsburg Fortress, 1998), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hildegard map.jpg|thumb|200px|Hildegard's preaching tours]]
Because of church limitation on public, discursive rhetoric, the medieval rhetorical arts included preaching, letter writing, poetry, and the encyclopedic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[James A. Herrick|Herrick, James A.]], ''The History of Rhetoric: An Introduction'', 4th ed. (Boston: Allyn Bacon, 2005), pp. ??.&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard's participation in these arts speaks to her significance as a female rhetorician, transcending bans on women's social participation and interpretation of scripture. The acceptance of public preaching by a woman, even a well-connected abbess and acknowledged prophet, does not fit the stereotype of this time. Her preaching was not limited to the monasteries; she preached publicly in 1160 in Germany. (New York: Routledge, 2001, 9). She conducted four preaching tours throughout Germany, speaking to both clergy and laity in chapter houses and in public, mainly denouncing clerical corruption and calling for reform.&lt;ref&gt;Ruether, Rosemary Radford. Visionary Women. Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 2002. pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many abbots and abbesses asked her for prayers and opinions on various matters.&lt;ref name="Bennett, Judith M 2001"/&gt; She traveled widely during her four preaching tours.&lt;ref&gt;Furlong, Monica. ''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; She had several devoted followers, including Guibert of Gembloux, who wrote to her frequently and became her secretary after Volmar's death in 1173. Hildegard also influenced several monastic women, exchanging letters with [[Elizabeth of Schönau|Elisabeth of Schönau]], a nearby visionary.&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard von Bingen, ''The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen'', trans. by Joseph L. Baird and Radd K. Ehrman (NY: Oxford University Press, 1994/1998), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hildegard corresponded with popes such as [[Pope Eugene III|Eugene III]] and [[Anastasius IV]], statesmen such as [[Abbot Suger]], German emperors such as [[Frederick I Barbarossa]], and other notable figures such as Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who advanced her work, at the behest of her abbot, Kuno, at the [[Synod of Trier]] in 1147 and 1148. Hildegard of Bingen's correspondence is an important component of her literary output.&lt;ref&gt;Schipperges, Heinrich. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Healing and the Nature of the Cosmos'' (New Jersey: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1997), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beatification, canonization and recognition as a Doctor of the Church===
Hildegard was one of the first persons for whom the Roman [[canonization]] process was officially applied, but the process took so long that four attempts at canonization were not completed and she remained at the level of her [[beatification]]. Her name was nonetheless taken up in the [[Roman Martyrology]] at the end of the 16th century. Her [[feast day]] is 17 September. Numerous popes have referred to Hildegard as a saint, including [[Pope John Paul II]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/1979/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19790908_800-ildegarda_it.html |title=Lettera per l'800° anniversario della morte di Santa Ildegarda |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2006/march/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060302_roman-clergy.html |title=Meeting with the members of the Roman Clergy |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2017-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 2012, Pope Benedict XVI extended the liturgical cult of St. Hildegard to the entire Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscatholic.org/news/2012/05/pope-recognizes-hildegard-saint-advances-causes-us-bishop-nun|title=News - USCatholic.org|website=www.uscatholic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a process known as "equivalent canonization,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=14287|title=Vatican newspaper explains 'equivalent canonization' of St. Hildegard of Bingen : News Headlines|website=www.catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus laying the groundwork for naming her a [[Doctor of the Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/otc.cfm?id=1015|title=New Doctors of the Church: St. Hildegard, St. John of Avila|website=www.catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October 2012, the [[feast of the Holy Rosary]], the pope named her a [[Doctor of the Church]], the fourth woman of 35 saints given that title by the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope Benedict creates two new doctors of the church|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-benedict-creates-two-new-doctors-of-the-church/|newspaper=Catholic News Agency|date=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called her "perennially relevant" and "an authentic teacher of theology and a profound scholar of natural science and music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope Benedict's Regina Caeli Address for the Soleminity of Pentecost, 27 May 2012|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/angelus/2012/documents/hf_ben-xvi_reg_20120527_pentecoste.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hildegard of Bingen also appears in the [[calendar of saints]] of various [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] churches, such as that of the [[Church of England]], in which she is commemorated on 17 September.

Hildegard's parish and pilgrimage church in Eibingen near [[Rüdesheim am Rhein|Rüdesheim]] houses her [[relic]]s.

===Modern interest===
[[File:Hildegard VS.JPG|thumb|left|150px|alt=German 10 DM commemorative coin issued by the Federal Republic of Germany (1998): Hildegard of Bingen writing the book (Liber), 'Sci vias Domini', inspired by the hand of the Lord|German 10 DM commemorative coin issued by the Federal Republic of Germany (1998) designed by [[Carl Vezerfi-Clemm]] on the 900th anniversary of Hildegard of Bingen's birth]]

In recent years, Hildegard has become of particular interest to [[feminist]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Marilyn R. Mumford, "A Feminist Prolegomenon for the Study of Hildegard of Bingen," in ''Gender, Culture, and the Arts: Women, Culture, and Society'', eds. R. Dotterer and S. Bowers (Selinsgrove: Susquehanna University Press, 1993), pp. 44–53.&lt;/ref&gt; They note her reference to herself as a member of the weaker sex and her rather constant belittling of women. Hildegard frequently referred to herself as an unlearned woman, completely incapable of Biblical exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;Ruether, Rosemary Radford. Visionary Women (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a statement on her part, however, worked to her advantage because it made her statements that all of her writings and music came from visions of the Divine more believable, therefore giving Hildegard the authority to speak in a time and place where few women were permitted a voice.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Newman, "Hildegard of Bingen: Visions and Validation," ''Church History'' 54 (1985): pp. 163–75; Barbara Newman, ''Sister of Wisdom: St. Hildegard's Theology of the Feminine'', (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard used her voice to amplify the Church's condemnation of institutional corruption, in particular [[simony]].

Hildegard has also become a figure of reverence within the contemporary [[New Age movement]], mostly because of her holistic and natural view of healing, as well as her status as a mystic. Though her medical writings were long neglected, and then studied without reference to their context,&lt;ref name=Sweet4&gt;Sweet, V. (1999). "Hildegard of Bingen and the greening of medieval medicine." ''Bulletin of the history of Medicine'', 73(3), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; she was the inspiration for Dr. Gottfried Hertzka's "Hildegard-Medicine", and is the namesake for June Boyce-Tillman's Hildegard Network, a healing center that focuses on a holistic approach to wellness and brings together people interested in exploring the links between spirituality, the arts, and healing.&lt;ref&gt;June Boyce-Tillman, "Hildegard of Bingen at 900: The Eye of a Woman," ''The Musical Times'' 139, no. 1865 (Winter, 1998): p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Her reputation as a medicinal writer and healer was also used by early feminists to argue for women's rights to attend medical schools.&lt;ref name=Sweet4/&gt; Hildegard's reincarnation has been debated since 1924 when Austrian mystic [[Rudolf Steiner]] lectured that a nun of her description was the past life of Russian poet philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Soloviev]],&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Rudolf. Karmic Relationships, Vol. 4 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophianic]] visions are often compared to Hildegard's.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Robert. The Sophia Teachings: The Emergence of the Divine Feminine in Our Time (Lindisfarne Books, 2007), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Sophiologist Robert Powell writes that hermetic astrology proves the match,&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Robert. Hermetic Astrology (Sophia Foundation Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; while mystical communities in Hildegard's lineage include that of artist Carl Schroeder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.returnofhildegard.com |title=Return of Hildegard |publisher=Return of Hildegard |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as studied by Columbia sociologist Courtney Bender&lt;ref&gt;Bender, Courtney. The New Metaphysicals: Spirituality and the American Religious Imagination (University Of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; and supported by reincarnation researchers Walter Semkiw and Kevin Ryerson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iisis.net/index.php?page=vladimir-soloviev-carl-schroeder&amp;hl=en_US |title=The Reincarnation Case of Carl Schroeder |publisher=Water Semkiw IISIS |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HistoAtlas''' is a free collection of historic geographic information of the human culture all over the world. This is achieved as a time enabled geographic information system ([[GIS]]) on the web. All information can be used and edited freely and is intended to be a resource for [[education]], [[archaeologists]], [[historians]] and others.

==Introduction==

HistoAtlas provides a system to actively maintain historical information derived from historical [[Document|records]] and check if it is [[consistent]]. It is not meant for the discovery of new historical [[facts]] but to put everything together so it can be presented as one whole story.

It is an open project making sure everyone benefits from it. Everyone can use the information and can [[collaborate]] on the project. Its main audience is the general public but it should also have enough historical details so also historians should be able to enjoy it.

HistoAtlas is not only able to visualize the changes in extent of different [[countries]], but also the events that caused this change altogether, because these things are historically more important than just the change of a border.

The atlas has information about different aspects of [[history]]. A few examples.

* Political [[Border|boundaries]] based on antique historical records or archeological research.
* [[Historical events]] like wars, disasters, discoveries, treaties and journeys that shaped the course of time.
* Facts about historical figures and their families that played an important role in history.
* The evolution of cultural aspects like [[languages]] and [[religions]].

==Strategy==

HistoAtlas aims to be a free, multilingual historical encyclopedia, intended as the most precise open content global historical reference.

In concept there are some similarities to what online encyclopedia like [[Wikipedia]] are doing, with differences on how data is stored, presented and used. It is a history oriented geographic information system. Information is structured more transparently{{Elucidate|date=September 2016}} so it can be searched more efficiently and presented in different ways. Wikipedia and other encyclopedia are focused on articles and are not able to create maps efficiently because they are not meant to do this.

But like [[Wikipedia]] the information and application will be made available under an [[open license]], meaning it will be maintained by volunteers who want to share their knowledge.

==Consistency==

The vision that HistoAtlas wants to put forward is the one of a collaborative system. Scientists require that the information is correct. Making sure that data is correct will be a high priority of the system. For now only a basic system has been put in place, but this will be extended in the future.

==Licensing==

Everything developed for the project is licensed under an open license. It can be used and improved by anyone.

All data published under the project is put under a [[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License]].

[[Multitrack recording]] of sound is the process in which sound and other electro-acoustic signals are captured on a recording medium such as [[magnetic tape]], which is divided into two or more audio tracks that run parallel with each other. Because they are carried on the same medium, the tracks stay in perfect synchronisation, while allowing multiple sound sources to be recorded asynchronously. The first system for creating [[stereophonic sound]] (using [[telephone]] technology) was demonstrated by [[Clément Ader]] in Paris in 1881. The [[pallophotophone]], invented by [[Charles A. Hoxie]] and first demonstrated in 1922, recorded optically on 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, and some versions used a format of as many as twelve tracks in parallel on each strip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gereports.com/edison-speaks-cracking-the-pallophotophone-code/ Edison speaks! Cracking the pallophotophone code | GE Reports&lt;!-- bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks were recorded one at a time in separate passes and were not intended for later [[Audio mixing|mixdown]] or stereophony; as with later half-track and quarter-track monophonic tape recording, the multiple tracks simply multiplied the maximum recording time possible, greatly reducing cost and bulk. British [[EMI]] engineer [[Alan Blumlein]] patented systems for recording stereophonic sound and [[surround sound]] on disc and film in 1933. The history of modern multitrack audio recording using magnetic tape began in 1943 with the invention of [[stereo]] tape recording, which divided the recording head into two tracks.

The next major development in multitrack recording came in the mid-1950s, when the [[Ampex]] corporation devised the concept of 8-track recording, utilizing its "Sel-Sync" (Selective Synchronous) recording system, and sold the first such machine to musician [[Les Paul]]&lt;ref name="snyder"&gt;[http://aes-media.org/historical/pdf/snyder_sel-sync.pdf ARSC Journal, Sel-sync and the "Octopus": How Came to be the First Recorder to Minimize Successive Copying in Overdubs]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, for the next 35 years, multitrack audio recording technology was largely confined to specialist radio, TV and music recording studios, primarily because multitrack tape machines were both very large and very expensive - the first Ampex 8-track recorder, installed in Les Paul's home studio in 1957, cost a princely US$10,000 - roughly three times the [[Average Indexed Monthly Earnings#Indexing yearly income|US average yearly income]] in 1957, and equivalent to around $90,000 in 2016. However, this situation changed radically in 1979 with the introduction of the TASCAM [[Portastudio]], which used the inexpensive [[compact audio cassette]] as the recording medium, making good-quality 4-track (and later 8-track) multitrack recording available to the average consumer for the first time. Ironically, by the time the Portastudio had become popular, electronics companies were already introducing digital audio recording systems, and by the 1990s, computer-based digital multitrack recording systems such as [[Pro Tools]] and [[Cubase]] were being adopted by the recording industry, and soon became standard. By the early 2000s, rapid advances in home computing and digital audio software were making digital multitrack audio recording systems available to the average consumer, and high-quality digital multitrack recording systems like [[GarageBand]] were being included as a standard feature on home computers.

==Overview==
Stereo sound recording on tape was perfected in 1943 by German audio engineers working for the [[AEG]] corporation. Around 250 stereo tape recordings were made during this period (of which only three have survived), but the technology remained a closely guarded secret within Germany until the end of World War II. After the war, American audio engineer [[John T. Mullin]] and the [[Ampex]] corporation pioneered the commercial development of tape recording in the USA, and the technology was rapidly taken up by radio and the music industry due to its superior sound fidelity and because tape - being a linear recording medium - could be easily edited, by physically cutting and splicing the tape, to remove unwanted elements and create a 'perfect' recording. 2-track tape recording was rapidly adopted for modern music in the 1950s because it enabled signals from two or more separate microphones to be recorded simultaneously, enabling stereophonic recordings to be made and edited conveniently, which in turn facilitated the rapid expansion of the consumer high-fidelity ("HiFi") market. Stereo (either true binaural two-microphone stereo or multimixed) quickly became the norm for commercial classical recordings and radio broadcasts, although many pop music and jazz  recordings continued to be issued in monophonic sound until the late 1960s.

Much of the credit for the development of multitrack recording goes to guitarist, composer and technician [[Les Paul]], who lent his name to Gibson's first solid-body electric guitar. His experiments with tapes and recorders in the early 1950s led him to order the first custom-built eight-track recorder from Ampex, and his pioneering recordings with his then wife, singer [[Mary Ford]]. But it was [[Patti Page]] who was the first vocalist to record her own voice, sound on sound, with a song called [[Confess_(song)|'Confess']], in 1947: Bill Putnam, an engineer for Mercury Records, was able to overdub Page's voice, due to his well-known use of technology. Thus, Page became the first pop artist to overdub her vocals on a song. This was months before [[Les Paul]] and [[Mary Ford]] had their first multi-voiced release. Paul was the first to make use of the technique of multitracking to record separate elements of a musical piece asynchronously — that is, separate elements could be recorded at different times. Paul's technique enabled him to listen to the tracks he had already taped and record new parts in time alongside them. In 1963, solo jazz pianist, Bill Evans, recorded [[Conversations with Myself (album)|Conversations with Myself]], an innovative solo album using the unconventional (in jazz solo recordings) technique of overdubbing over himself, in effect creating a two-piano duet of jazz improvisations.

Despite [[Ampex]] having created the first 8-track tape machines for [[Les Paul]] and [[Atlantic Records]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/Remembering_Ahmet_Ertegun_and_Atlantics_Early_Years |title=Remembering Ahmet Ertegun and Atlantic’s Early Years |publisher=BMI|date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, multitrack recording was taken up in a more limited way in the industry via 3-track recorders. These proved extremely useful for popular music, since they enabled backing music to be recorded on two tracks (either to allow the overdubbing of separate parts, or to create a full stereo backing track) while the third track was reserved for the lead vocalist. Three-track recorders remained in widespread commercial use until the mid-1960s and many famous pop recordings — including many of [[Phil Spector]]'s so-called "Wall of Sound" productions and early [[Motown]] hits — were taped on 3-track recorders.

The next evolution was 4-track recording, which was the studio standard through the mid 1960s. Many of the most famous recordings by [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] were recorded on 4-track, and the engineers at London's [[Abbey Road Studios]] became particularly adept at the technique called "reduction mixes" in the UK and "bouncing down" in the United States, in which multiple tracks were recorded onto one 4-track machine and then mixed together and transferred (bounced down) to one track of a second 4-track machine. In this way, it was possible to record literally dozens of separate tracks and combine them into finished recordings of great complexity.

By the mid-1960s, the ready availability of the most up-to-date multitrack recorders - which were by then standard equipment in the leading Los Angeles recording studios - enabled [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]] to become one of the first pop producers to exploit the huge potential of multitrack recording. During the group's most innovative period of music-making, from 1964 to 1967, Wilson developed elaborate techniques for assembling the band's songs, which combined elements captured on both 4-track and 8-track recorders, as well as making extensive use of tape editing. By 1964, Wilson's increasingly complex arrangements had far outstripped the group's limited musical abilities - singer-guitarist [[Carl Wilson]] was the only group member who regularly contributed to these tracking sessions - so Wilson began routinely recording all the instrumental backing tracks for his songs using the team of top-rank professional studio musicians who came to be known as "[[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]]". For the group's landmark ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album in 1965, Wilson recorded all the album's elaborate backing tracks using The Wrecking Crew and other session musicians, while the Beach Boys were away touring; the session musicians typically performed these instrumental tracks as ensemble performances, which were recorded and mixed live, direct to a 4-track recorder. When the other Beach Boys returned from touring, they moved to Columbia's Hollywood studio, which was equipped with the latest 8-track technology; by this time, Wilson and his engineers had 'reduced' the pre-recorded 4-track backing tracks to a mono mix, which was then dubbed onto one track of the 8-track master tape; Wilson then recorded the vocal tracks, assigning one individual track to each of the six vocalists (including soon-to-be permanent member [[Bruce Johnston]]), leaving the eighth track available for final 'sweetening' elements, such as additional vocal or instrumental touches, and lastly, all these elements were mixed down to the mono master tape. Nearly all of the Beach Boys' 4-track and 8-track masters from this period are preserved in Capitol's archive, allowing the label to release several expansive boxed sets of this music; ''[[The Pet Sounds Sessions]]'' (1997), includes nearly all the separate backing and vocal tracks from the album, as well as new stereo mixes of all the songs, while the 9-CD ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'' (2011) features a wide cross-section of the huge amount of instrumental and vocal material (totalling around 50 hours of recordings) that was recorded for the group's never-completed 1967 ''magnum opus'', ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''.

All of the Beatles classic mid-1960s recordings, including the albums ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' and ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', were recorded in this way. There were limitations, however, because of the build-up of noise during the bouncing-down process, and the Abbey Road engineers are still justly famed for the ability to create dense multitrack recordings while keeping background noise to a minimum.

4-track tape also led to a related development, [[quadraphonic]] sound, in which each of the four tracks was used to simulate a complete 360-degree surround sound. A number of albums including Pink Floyd's ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' and Mike Oldfield's ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' were released both in stereo and quadrophonic format in the 1970s, but 'quad' failed to gain wide commercial acceptance. Although it is now sometimes considered a gimmick, it was the direct precursor of the [[surround sound]] technology that has become standard in many modern home theater systems.

In a [[professional audio]] setting today, such as a [[recording studio]], [[audio engineer]]s may use 64 tracks or more for their recordings, utilizing one or more tracks for each instrument played.

The combination of the ability to edit via tape splicing, and the ability to record multiple tracks, revolutionized studio recording. It became common studio recording practice to record on multiple tracks, and mix down afterward. The convenience of tape editing and multitrack recording led to the rapid adoption of [[magnetic tape]] as the primary technology for commercial musical recordings. Although 33⅓ rpm and 45 rpm vinyl records were the dominant consumer format, recordings were customarily made first on [[magnetic tape]], then transferred to disc, with [[Bing Crosby]] leading the way in the adoption of this method in the United States.

== Ampex's original 8-track recorder ==

The original Ampex 8-track recorder (not to be confused with [[8-track tape]] endless-loop cartridge players), model 5258, was an internal Ampex project.  It was based on an Ampex 1" data recorder transport with modified Ampex model 350 electronics.  It stood over {{convert|7|ft|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|250|lb|kg}}.  8 tracks were chosen because that was the number of {{convert|0.070|in|mm}} recording tracks with {{convert|0.060|in|mm}} guard tracks that would fit on a {{convert|1|in|mm}} recording tape, the widest tape available at the time.&lt;ref name="snyder" /&gt;

The first of the Ampex 8-track recorders was sold to [[Les Paul]] for $10,000 in 1957 and was installed in his home recording studio by [[David Sarser]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reevesaudio.com/studiothree.html Studio 3: A Place of Recording Studio History...]&lt;/ref&gt;  It became known as the "Octopus".

The second Ampex model 5258 8-track was sold to [[Atlantic Records]] at [[Tom Dowd|Tom Dowd's]] insistence in late 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/30/arts/tom-dowd-77-an-innovator-in-the-art-of-recording-music.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jon | last=Pareles | title=Tom Dowd, 77, an Innovator In the Art of Recording Music | date=October 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlantic was the first record company to use a multi-track (as opposed to stereo or 3-track) recorder in their studio.

== Multi-channel recorders ==

Multi-track recording differs from [[overdubbing]] and sound on sound because it records separate signals to individual tracks.  Sound on sound which Les Paul invented adds a new performance to an existing recording by placing a second playback head in front of the erase head to play back the existing track before erasing it and re-recording a new track.

Multi-track recorders also differ from early stereo and three track recorders that were available at the time in that they can record individual tracks while preserving the other tracks.  The original multi-channel recorders could only record all tracks at once.

The earliest multitrack recorders were analog magnetic tape machines with two or three tracks. [[Elvis Presley]] was first recorded on multitrack during 1957, as [[RCA]]'s engineers were testing their new machines. [[Buddy Holly]]'s last studio session in 1958 employed three-track, resulting in his only stereo releases not to include overdubs. The new three-track system allowed the lead vocal to be recorded on a dedicated track, while the remaining two tracks could be used to record the backing tracks in full stereo.

== Other early multi-track recorders ==

[[Frank Zappa]] experimented in the early 1960s with a custom built 5-track recorder built by engineer Paul Buff in his [[Pal Recording Studio]] in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California]]. Buff later went on to work in larger Hollywood studios. However, recorders with four or more tracks were restricted mainly to major American recording studios until the mid-to-late 1960s, mainly because of import restrictions and the high cost of the technology. In England, pioneering independent producer [[Joe Meek]] produced all of his innovative early 1960s recordings using monophonic and two-track recorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cleveland|first1=Barry|title=Joe Meek's Bold Techniques|date=2013|publisher=ElevenEleven|isbn=978-0-615-73600-6|pages=121|edition=Second|url=http://www.barrycleveland.com/jm-about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Meek, [[EMI]] house producer [[George Martin]] was considered an innovator for his use of two-track as a means to making better mono records, carefully balancing vocals and instruments; [[Abbey Road Studios]] installed Telefunken four-track machines in 1959 and 1960 (replaced in 1965 by smaller, more durable Studer machines), but [[The Beatles]] would not have access to them until late 1963, and all recordings prior to their first world hit single ''[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]'' (1964) were made on two-track machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Recording The Beatles |last= Kehew |first= Brian |publisher= Curvebender Publishing |author2=Kevin Ryan |pages= 216 |year= 2006 |isbn= 0-9785200-0-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on popular music==

The artistic potential of the multitrack recorder came to the attention of the public in the 1960s, when artists such as [[the Beatles]] and [[the Beach Boys]] began to multitrack extensively, and from then on virtually all popular music was recorded in this manner. The technology developed very rapidly during these years. At the start of their careers, the Beatles and Beach Boys each recorded live to mono, two-track (the Beatles), or three-track (the Beach Boys); by 1965 they used multitracking to create pop music of unprecedented complexity.

The Beach Boys' acclaimed 1966 LP ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' relied on multitrack recorders for its innovative production. [[Brian Wilson]] pretaped all the instrumental backing tracks with a large ensemble, recording the performances live, direct to a four-track recorder. These four-track backing tapes were then '[[overdubbing|dubbed down]]' to one track of an eight-track tape. Six of the remaining seven tracks were then used to individually record the vocals of each member of The Beach Boys, and the eighth track was reserved for any final 'sweetening' overdubs of instruments or voices.

[[3M]] introduced the 1-inch eight-track version of their model M-23 recorder in 1966, probably the first mass-produced machine of this format.  It remained in production until 1970 and was used by many top studios worldwide including Abbey Road Studios in London.  Both [[Pete Townshend]] and [[John Lennon]] had 3M 8-track machines in their home [[project studio]]s c. 1969-1970.  Ampex began mass production of their competing 1-inch eight-track MM1000 in 1967.  One of the first 8-track machines in Los Angeles was built by [[Scully Recording Instruments]] of Bridgeport, Connecticut and installed at American Recorders in late 1967.  The [[Steppenwolf (Steppenwolf album)|debut album]] by [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] was recorded there and was released in January 1968.

Because The Beatles did not gain access to eight-track recorders until 1968, their groundbreaking ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' LP (1967) was created using pairs of four-track machines; the group also used [[vari-speed]] (also called [[pitch shift]]) to achieve unique sounds, and they were the first group in the world to use an important offshoot of multitrack recording, the [[Automatic Double Tracking]] (ADT) system invented by Abbey Road staff engineer [[Ken Townsend]] in 1966.

Other artists began experimenting with multitrack's possibilities also, with [[the Music Machine]] (of "Talk Talk" fame) recording on a custom-built ten-track setup, and [[Pink Floyd]] collaborating with former Beatles [[recording engineer]] [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman "Hurricane" Smith]], who produced their first albums.

The first eight-track recorder in the UK was built by Scully and installed at London's [[Advision Studios]] in early 1968.  Among the first eight-track recordings made there were the single ''[[Dogs (The Who song)|Dogs]]'' by [[The Who]] and the album ''[[My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They're Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows]]'' by the band [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]].  [[Trident Studios]] obtained their first eight-track recorder soon afterward.  It was during The Beatles' recording of their ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' sessions of late 1968 that [[EMI]]'s [[Abbey Road Studios]] finally had eight-track recorders installed, until then the group went to Trident to record with eight-tracks.  The Beatles used eight-track to record portions of  the ''White Album'', the single "[[Hey Jude]]" and the later ''[[Abbey Road]]''.

Other western countries also lagged well behind the USA – in [[Australia]], the largest local recording label, [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]], did not install a four-track recorder until late 1966; the first eight-track recorders did not appear there until the late 1960s.

==Large format analog recorders==

In 1967 [[Ampex]] built its first prototype 16-track [[professional audio]] recorder at the request of Mirasound Studios in New York City.  This machine used reels of 2-inch tape on a modified tape transport system originally built  for video recording.  In 1968 it introduced the 16-track production model MM-1000, the first commercially available 16-track machine.  Machines of this size are difficult to move and costly to maintain.  Prices were very high, typically $10,000 to $30,000 U.S. dollars.

One of the first 16-track recorders was installed at CBS Studios in [[New York City]] where it was used to record the second album by ''[[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears (Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears album)|Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]]'' released in December 1968.  The [[Grateful Dead]] released their first 16-track recordings ''[[Aoxomoxoa]]'' in June 1969 and ''[[Live/Dead]]'' in November 1969.  TTG Studios in [[Los Angeles]] built its own 16-track machine in 1968.  This was used on [[Frank Zappa]]'s album ''[[Hot Rats]]'' released in October 1969. ''[[Volunteers (Jefferson Airplane album)|Volunteers]]'' by [[Jefferson Airplane]] was released in November 1969. The back of the Jefferson Airplane album cover includes a picture of the 16-track MM-1000.

Advision and Trident were also among the first in the U.K. to install 16-track machines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Trident installed its first 16-track machine in late 1969. "After The Flood", a song from the [[Van der Graaf Generator]] album ''[[The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other]]'', was recorded at this studio on 16 tracks in December 1969. Production of 16-track machines boomed and the number of studios worldwide using these machines exploded during 1970 and 1971.  By the end of 1971 there were at least 21 studios in London using 16-track recorders in conjunction with [[Dolby]] noise reduction.&lt;ref&gt;"Spotlight on London" Billboard Magazine, November 13, 1971 - advertisement, pg. L-26&lt;/ref&gt; Groups using Trident at this time also included [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[David Bowie]] as well as [[Queen (band)|Queen]] who experimented with multitracking extensively most prominently on their albums [[Queen II]] and ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]''.

Australia's first sixteen-track recorder was installed at [[Armstrong's Studios]] in [[Melbourne]] in 1971; Festival installed Australia's first 24-track recorder at its Sydney studio in 1974.  During the 1970s, sixteen, twenty-four, and thirty-two tracks became common in professional studios, with recording tape reaching two and three inches (5.08&amp;nbsp;cm - 7.62&amp;nbsp;cm) wide.  The so-called "golden age" of large format professional analog recorders would last into the 1990s when the technology was mostly replaced with digital tape machines, and later on, computer systems using [[hard disk drive]]s instead of tape.  Some music producers and musicians still prefer working with the sound of vintage analog recording equipment despite the additional costs and difficulties involved.

Large format analog multitrack machines can have up to 24 tracks on a tape two inches wide which is the widest analog tape that is generally available. Prototype machines, by [[Music Center Incorporated|MCI]] in 1978, using 3" tape for 32 tracks never went into production, though [[Otari Incorporated|Otari]] made a 32 track 2" MX-80.  A few studios still operate large format analog recorders, though much of the time their use is only to copy sounds onto a modern digital format.  Maintaining these machines has become increasingly difficult as new parts are rarely available.  New tape is still available but prices have risen significantly in recent years.

[[File:TEAC 2340.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] 2340, a popular early (1973) home multitrack recorder, four tracks on ¼ inch tape.]]

==Home systems==

In 1972 [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] marketed their consumer 4-channel [[quadraphonic]] tape recorders for use as home multitrack recorders.  The result were the popular TEAC 2340 and 3340 models.  Both used ¼ inch tape.  The 2340 ran at either 3¾ or 7½ inches per second and used 7-inch reels while the 3340 ran at 7½ or 15&amp;nbsp;inches per second and used 10½ inch reels.  The 2340 was priced at under U.S. $1,000 making it very popular for home use.

The advent of the [[compact audio cassette]] (developed in 1963) ultimately led to affordable, portable four-track machines such as the [[Tascam]] [[Portastudio]] which debuted in 1979. Cassette-based machines could not provide the same audio quality as [[reel-to-reel]] machines, but served as a useful tool for professional and semi-pro musicians in making [[demo (music)|song demos]]. The Portastudio had a revolutionary effect on the emerging [[punk rock]] genre, because it enabled young bands to make recordings without signing to a [[record label]]. In the early years of punk, many bands self-produced their own recordings and sold them at gigs and by putting advertisements in underground [[zine]]s. [[Bruce Springsteen|Bruce Springsteen's]] 1982 album ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]'' was made this way, with Springsteen choosing the album's earlier demo versions over the later studio recordings.

The familiar tape cassette was designed to accommodate four channels of audio – in a commercially recorded cassette these four tracks would normally constitute the stereo channels (each consisting of two tracks) for both 'sides' of the cassette – in a four-track cassette recorder all four tracks of a cassette are utilized together, often with the tape running at twice the normal speed (3¾ instead of 1⅞ inches per second) for increased fidelity. A separate signal can be recorded on to each of four tracks. (As such, the four-track machine does not utilize the two separate sides of the cassette in the conventional sense; if the cassette is inserted the other way round, all four tracks play in reverse.) As with professional machines, two or more tracks can be bounced down to one. When recording is complete, the volume level of each track is optimized, [[effect unit|electronic effects]] such as [[reverb]] are added to certain tracks where desired, each track is separately 'panned' to the desired point in the stereo field and the resulting stereo signal is mixed down to a separate stereo machine (such as a conventional cassette recorder).

==Digital multitracking==

By the early 1970s, Thomas Stockham of Sound Stream Digital, created the first practical use of [[pulse code modulation]], also called PCM [[digital recording]], for [[high fidelity]] purposes. The first to be released were rereleased cleaned up versions of acoustic recordings made by the great tenor, [[Enrico Caruso]]. Early computer algorithms were used in the process of cleaning up the scratchy old 78 RPM records. The process could not be done in "real time" as the early computers were not very powerful or fast, compared to 2010-era computers. All of the data had to be stored on linear digital tape and then played back, in real time. The actual ingest from the 78 RPM records to the digital tape was also done in real-time. The computer processing to clean up the surface noise, pops and scratches took the early computers quite some time to process.

By the late 1970s, [[3M]] introduced the first digital multi-track recorder. It utilized 1-inch wide tape and recorded 32 tracks. Unlike analog tape, edits could not be accomplished with a grease pencil, razor blades and splicing tape. So a secondary 4 track editing &amp; mix down recorder was also created with an electronically-controlled edit controller to make effective digital edits. This early system used a 16-bit digital "word". The only converters of the day were 12 bit &amp; 4 bit. So two were cascaded/daisy-chained to create the necessary 16-bit "word" for 96 DB of dynamic range. The signal was then sampled faster than any other digital recordings made up until that time at 50,000 times per second (50&amp;nbsp;kHz). It was known to be the best sounding{{Disputed inline|Talk page section|date=April 2018}} of all the later digital multi-track recorders because their use of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling did not become the industry standards later established as 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz for CD's &amp; 48&amp;nbsp;kHz for digital video.

The accepted world standard was created by [[Sony]] along with Philips. Sony created a 24 track digital recorder and [[Mitsubishi Corporation]] created a different 32 track digital recorder. The Mitsubishi recorded their data differently and it could be edited, the old-fashioned analog way, with a razor blade and splicing tape. The Sony used 1/2 inch tape whereas the Mitsubishi used 1 inch wide tape. So the first recordings that were released produced on the 3M, 32 track digital recorder were still analog vinyl releases, since the CD had yet to be invented. These professional linear tape digital recorders established the "DASH" format meaning, " Digital Audio Stationary Head". By the time the other manufacturers released their digital multi-track recorders, the CD had already been developed. The sampling rate dictates the upper range of the frequency response, whereas the bit depth dictates the [[dynamic range]] and [[signal to noise ratio]]s.

Starting in 1992, the ALESIS Corporation, a company which made digital [[drum machine]]s and inexpensive analog [[audio mixer]]s introduced the first multitrack, eight track, project studio, digital 8 track machine. It was named the ADAT, after the earlier 2 track digital recorders of the time known as DAT (Digital Audio Tape), which were based upon a small spinning head, similar to a consumer video recorder. The ADAT machine recorded its data in an already well-established consumer format based on VHS videotape recorder technology. Eight separate data tracks were recorded within the same bandwidth it took to record a TV show on a home video recorder (VHS). Numerous machines could be electronically locked together with a single cable. You could plug in enough 8 track machines together to create one giant 128 track machine. And like the professional studio recorders before it, a large full function [[remote control]] was also available.

The following year, the TEAC/TASCAM Corporation, introduced their DA-88. Those used the smaller 8&amp;nbsp;mm video format tapes. Those recorded four duplexed pairs of data tracks and would require a "read before write" function for [[overdubbing]] purposes of adjacent tracks. A full size remote and remote metering was also made available. Later units introduced by both companies provided for higher bit depths such as 20 &amp; 24 bit. These machines like the early home studio TEAC's before them, slashed the prices of professional digital multitrack recording. It changed the recording industry forever.
[[File:Korg D888.jpg|right|thumb|Korg D888 eight-track digital recorder]]
By the late 1990s, dedicated multitrack recorders faded with the introduction of the [[classic Mac OS|Macintosh operating system]] and [[Windows operating system]]s in personal computers. Some of the first companies jumping on board with this technology were New England Digital and Digidesign, from the US &amp; Fairlight, from Australia. Through the 1990s, multitrack recorders became digital, using a variety of technologies and media types. These including digital tape format (such as [[ADAT]]), or in some cases [[Minidisc]]s.

Some of the leading providers of multitrackers were [[Tascam]] (hard drive or cassette based), [[Alesis]] (ADAT digital tape based), [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]/[[Boss Corporation|Boss]] (hard drive based), [[Fostex]] (hard drive based), [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] (hard drive based), and [[Korg]].

A highly competitive market and rapidly falling costs for this equipment has made it common to find multitrack recording technology outside a typical recording studio.

== Computer-based recording ==

The first software-based digital multi-track recorder, called Deck, was released in 1990. The core engine technology and much of the user interface was programmed and designed by Josh Rosen, Mats Myrberg and John Dalton from a small San Francisco based company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.12/osc.html Wired article on Digidesign/OSC history]&lt;/ref&gt; They formed the platform upon which [[Pro Tools]] was built in 1991. The same technology lay behind the 1992 release of [[Cubase]] Audio, the first version to offer audio support in addition to [[MIDI]] sequencing capabilities.

While hardware costs have fallen the power of the personal computer have increased, so that in the 2010s, a good quality home computer is sufficiently powerful to serve as a complete multitrack recorder, if a band or performer has a USB microphone or a regular microphone and a [[sound card]] adapter, using inexpensive hardware and software. Since 2012, the multitracking software [[GarageBand]] is offered as a free download for all of [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] new computers or $4.99 for older models.  GarageBand added to the many free or under $100 solutions available to the Windows platform that run on less expensive but often more powerful hardware.  In a price range between $150 and usually under $1000, superior software mimicking complex recording studios that once could cost a hundred thousand dollars, or more, are also available  However solutions this powerful are not needed for most applications.  This is a far cry from the days when multitrack recorders cost thousands of dollars and few people could afford them.  In early (circa) 2000 the availability of low cost CakeWalk for windows provided opportunities for many to get a start in multi-track digital recording on the Windows for around $50 to $100.  After hardware became more powerful, more capabilities became available, including more digital channels and plug in effects.

In the 2010s, the availability of inexpensive software coupled with low cost hardware solutions, have enabled many [[singer-songwriter]]s to self-produce their first recordings without paying high fees for a professional recording studio or audio engineer. The most popular DAW today are: Pro Tools, Reaper, Live, Cubase, Logic and Digital Performer.

'''History painting''' is a genre in painting defined by its subject matter rather than artistic style. History paintings usually depict a moment in a narrative story, rather than a specific and static subject, as in a portrait.  The term is derived from the wider senses of the word ''historia'' in Latin and Italian, meaning  "story" or "narrative", and essentially means "story painting". Most history paintings are not of scenes from [[history]], especially paintings from before about 1850.

In modern English, historical painting is sometimes used to describe the painting of scenes from history in its narrower sense, especially for 19th-century art, excluding religious, mythological and allegorical subjects, which are included in the broader term history painting, and before the 19th century were the most common subjects for history paintings.

History paintings almost always contain a number of figures, often a large number, and normally show some type of action that is a moment in a narrative. The genre includes depictions of moments in religious narratives, above all the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', as well as narrative scenes from [[mythology]], and also [[allegorical]] scenes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/history-painting National Gallery, Glossary entry]; [http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg61/gg61-main1.html History Painting Gallery] from The National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC; Green and Seddon, 7-8; Harrison, 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; These groups were for long the most frequently painted; works such as [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] are therefore history paintings, as are most very large paintings before the 19th century. The term covers large paintings in [[oil on canvas]] or [[fresco]] produced between the Renaissance and the late 19th century, after which the term is generally not used even for the many works that still meet the basic definition.&lt;ref&gt;Green and Seddon, 11-15&lt;/ref&gt;

History painting may be used interchangeably with '''historical painting''', and was especially so used before the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History painting|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/History+painting|work=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary|publisher=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where a distinction is made "historical painting" is the painting of scenes from secular history, whether specific episodes or generalized scenes.  In the 19th century historical painting in this sense became a distinct genre. In phrases such as "historical painting materials", "historical" means in use before about 1900, or some earlier date.

History paintings were traditionally regarded as the highest form of Western painting, occupying the most prestigious place in the [[hierarchy of genres]], and considered the equivalent to the [[epic (genre)|epic]] in literature. In his  ''[[De Pictura]]'' of 1436, [[Leon Battista Alberti]] had argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 11-12; Barlow, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

This view remained general until the 19th century, when artistic movements began to struggle against the establishment institutions of [[academic art]], which continued to adhere to it. At the same time there was from the latter part of the 18th century an increased interest in depicting in the form of history painting moments of drama from recent or contemporary history, which had long largely been confined to [[military art|battle-scenes]] and scenes of formal surrenders and the like. Scenes from ancient history had been popular in the [[early Renaissance]], and once again became common in the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] periods, and still more so with the rise of [[Neoclassicism]]. In some 19th or 20th century contexts, the term may refer specifically to paintings of scenes from secular history, rather than those from religious narratives, literature or mythology.

==Development==
The term is generally not used in art history in speaking of medieval painting, although the Western tradition was developing in large [[altarpiece]]s, fresco cycles, and other works, as well as [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscripts]]. It comes to the fore in [[Italian Renaissance painting]], where a series of increasingly ambitious works were produced, many still religious, but several, especially in Florence, which did actually feature near-contemporary historical scenes such as the set of three huge canvases on ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' by [[Paolo Uccello]], the abortive ''[[Battle of Cascina (Michelangelo)|Battle of Cascina]]'' by Michelangelo and the ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], neither of which were completed. Scenes from ancient history and mythology were also popular. Writers such as Alberti and the following century [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'', followed public and artistic opinion in judging the best painters above all on their production of large works of history painting (though in fact the only modern (post-classical) work described in ''[[De Pictura]]'' is [[Giotto]]'s huge ''[[Navicella (mosaic)|Navicella]]'' in mosaic).  Artists continued for centuries to strive to make their reputation by producing such works, often neglecting genres to which their talents were better suited.

[[File:Angelo Bronzino 001.jpg|thumb|''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'', [[Agnolo Bronzino]], c. 1545. According to [[André Félibien]] allegory was the highest form of all history painting.]]

There was some objection to the term, as many writers preferred terms such as "poetic painting" (''poesia''), or wanted to make a distinction between the "true" ''istoria'', covering history including biblical and religious scenes, and the ''fabula'', covering pagan myth, allegory, and scenes from fiction, which could not be regarded as true.&lt;ref&gt;See Reynolds below; nonetheless he bowed to convention: "In conformity to custom, I call this part of the art history painting; it ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is." (''Discources'', IV); for debates over terminology in the Italian Renaissance, see Bull, 391-394&lt;/ref&gt; The large works of [[Raphael]] were long considered, with those of Michelangelo, as the finest models for the genre.

In the [[Raphael Rooms]] in the [[Vatican Palace]], allegories and historical scenes are mixed together, and the [[Raphael Cartoons]] show scenes from the Gospels, all in the [[Grand Manner]] that from the [[High Renaissance]] became associated with, and often expected in, history painting. In the Late Renaissance and [[Baroque]] the painting of actual history tended to degenerate into panoramic battle-scenes with the victorious monarch or general perched on a horse accompanied with his retinue, or formal scenes of ceremonies, although some artists managed to make a masterpiece from such unpromising material, as [[Velázquez]] did with his ''[[The Surrender of Breda]]''.

An influential formulation of the hierarchy of genres, confirming the history painting at the top, was made in 1667 by [[André Félibien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:&lt;blockquote&gt;Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement ; &amp; comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, &amp; ne peut prétendre à l'honneur que reçoivent les plus sçavans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure à la représentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire &amp; la fable ; il faut représenter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agréables comme les Poëtes ; &amp; montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allégoriques, sçavoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, &amp; les mystères les plus relevez.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled. For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the late 18th century, with both religious and mytholological painting in decline, there was an increased demand for paintings of scenes from history, including contemporary history. This was in part driven by the changing audience for ambitious paintings, which now increasingly made their reputation in public exhibitions rather than by impressing the owners of and visitors to palaces and public buildings. Classical history remained popular, but scenes from national histories were often the best-received. From 1760 onwards, the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain]], the first body to organize regular exhibitions in London, awarded two generous prizes each year to paintings of subjects from British history.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 17, and 32-34 and generally on growth of historical painting.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Benjamin West]], ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770), an early example of the vogue for painting scenes from recent history.]]

The unheroic nature of modern dress was regarded as a serious difficulty. When, in 1770, [[Benjamin West]] proposed to paint ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' in contemporary dress, he was firmly instructed to use classical costume by many people. He ignored these comments and showed the scene in modern dress. Although [[George III]] refused to purchase the work, West succeeded both in overcoming his critics' objections and inaugurating a more historically accurate style in such paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Rothenstein, 16-17; Strong, 24-26&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists depicted scenes, regardless of when they occurred, in classical dress and for a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depictions of the heroic male nude.

The large production, using the finest French artists, of propaganda paintings glorifying the exploits of [[Napoleon]], were matched by works, showing both victories and losses, from the anti-Napoleonic alliance by artists such as [[Goya]] and [[J.M.W. Turner]]. [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818–1819) was a sensation, appearing to update the history painting for the 19th century, and showing anonymous figures famous only for being victims of what was then a famous and controversial disaster at sea. Conveniently their clothes had been worn away to classical-seeming rags by the point the painting depicts. At the same time the demand for traditional large religious history paintings very largely fell away.

In the mid-nineteenth century there arose a style known as [[historicism (art)|historicism]], which marked a formal imitation of historical styles and/or artists. Another development in the nineteenth century was the treatment of historical subjects, often on a large scale, with the values of [[Genre works|genre painting]], the depiction of scenes of everyday life, and [[anecdote]]. Grand depictions of events of great public importance were supplemented with scenes depicting more personal incidents in the lives of the great, or of scenes centred on unnamed figures involved in historical events, as in the [[Troubadour style]]. At the same time scenes of ordinary life with moral, political or satirical content became often the main vehicle for expressive interplay between figures in painting, whether given a modern or historical setting.

By the later 19th century, history painting was often explicitly rejected by [[avant-garde]] movements such as the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] (except for [[Édouard Manet]]) and the [[Symbolist]]s, and according to one recent writer "[[Modernism]] was to a considerable extent built upon the rejection of History Painting... All other genres are deemed capable of entering, in one form or another, the 'pantheon' of modernity considered, but History Painting is excluded".&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===The terms===
Initially, "history painting" and "historical painting" were used interchangeably in English, as when Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] in his fourth ''Discourse'' uses both indiscriminately to cover "history painting", while saying "...it ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is", reflecting the French term ''peinture historique'', one equivalent of "history painting".  The terms began to separate in the 19th century, with "historical painting" becoming a sub-group of "history painting" restricted to subjects taken from history in its normal sense.  In 1853 [[John Ruskin]] asked his audience: "What do you at present ''mean'' by historical painting? Now-a-days it means the endeavour, by the power of imagination, to portray some historical event of past days."&lt;ref&gt;Lecture IV, p. 172, ''Lectures on Architecture and Painting: Delivered at Edinburgh, in November, 1853'', 1854, Wiley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qKsaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=%22historical+painting%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lxuvUePlD4Pu0gXYk4CwBA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22historical%20painting%22&amp;f=false google books].&lt;/ref&gt;  So for example [[Harold Wethey]]'s three-volume catalogue of the paintings of [[Titian]] (Phaidon, 1969–75) is divided between "Religious Paintings", "Portraits", and "Mythological and Historical Paintings", though both volumes I and III cover what is included in the term "History Paintings".  This distinction is useful but is by no means generally observed, and the terms are still often used in a confusing manner. Because of the potential for confusion modern academic writing tends to avoid the phrase "historical painting", talking instead of "historical subject matter" in history painting, but where the phrase is still used in contemporary scholarship it will normally mean the painting of subjects from history, very often in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;As shown in the usages in Barlow, Strong, and Wright&lt;/ref&gt;  "Historical painting" may also be used, especially in discussion of painting techniques in conservation studies, to mean "old", as opposed to modern or recent painting.&lt;ref&gt;As in "The beautifully renovated Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam will open its doors to the public in 2013. To celebrate this event the Rijksmuseum will host a three-day symposium on Historical Painting Techniques. The central theme of the symposium will be the technical study of historically used painting techniques, the historical painting materials, their origin and trade, and their application in the painter’s workshop." [https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/research-and-library/painting-techniques Rijksmuseum, "Painting Techniques - Call for Papers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531094855/https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/research-and-library/painting-techniques |date=2013-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 19th-century British writing on art the terms "'''subject painting'''" or "anecdotic" painting were often used for works in a line of development going back to [[William Hogarth]] of monoscenic depictions of crucial moments in an implied narrative with unidentified characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela M. Fletcher|title=Narrating Modernity: The British Problem Picture, 1895-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvT_0aOkOSkC&amp;pg=PA146|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3568-0|page=146 note 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[William Holman Hunt]]'s 1853 painting ''[[The Awakening Conscience]]'' or [[Augustus Egg]]'s ''[[Past and Present (paintings)|Past and Present]]'', a set of three paintings, updating sets by Hogarth such as ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]''.

===19th century===
[[File:Richard Parkes Bonington - Henri III - WGA02429.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Richard Parkes Bonington]], ''[[Henri III of France]]'', a small "Intimate Romantic" anecdotal scene from history.]]
History painting was the dominant form of [[academic art|academic painting]] in the various national academies in the 18th century, and for most of the 19th, and  increasingly historical subjects dominated.  During the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods the heroic treatment of contemporary history in a frankly propagandistic fashion by [[Antoine-Jean, Baron Gros]], [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Carle Vernet]] and others was supported by the French state, but after the fall of Napoleon in 1815 the French governments were not regarded as suitable for heroic treatment and many artists retreated further into the past to find subjects, though in Britain depicting the victories of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] mostly occurred after they were over.  Another path was to choose contemporary subjects that were oppositional to government either at home and abroad, and many of what were arguably the last great generation of history paintings were protests at contemporary episodes of repression or outrages at home or abroad: [[Goya]]'s ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' (1814), [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818–19), [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) and ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830).  These were heroic, but showed heroic suffering by ordinary civilians.

[[File:Conversión del duque de Gandía, Museo del Prado.jpg|thumb|[[José Moreno Carbonero]], ''Conversion of the Duke of Gandía'', 1881, [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid]]
[[Romanticism|Romantic artists]] such as Géricault and Delacroix, and those from other movements such as the English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] continued to regard history painting as the ideal for their most ambitious works. Others such as [[Jan Matejko]] in Poland, [[Vasily Surikov]] in Russia, [[José Moreno Carbonero]] in Spain and [[Paul Delaroche]] in France became specialized painters of large historical subjects.  The ''[[style troubadour]]'' ("[[troubadour]] style") was a somewhat derisive French term for earlier paintings of medieval and Renaissance scenes, which were often small and depicting moments of anecdote rather than drama; [[Ingres]], [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] and  [[Henri Jean-Baptiste Victoire Fradelle|Henri Fradelle]] painted such works. Sir [[Roy Strong]] calls this type of work the "Intimate Romantic", and in French it was known as the "peinture de genre historique" or "peinture anecdotique" ("historical genre painting" or "anecdotal painting").&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 36-40; Wright, 269-273, French terms on p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Church commissions for large group scenes from the Bible had greatly reduced, and historical painting became very significant.  Especially in the early 19th century, much historical painting depicted specific moments from historical literature, with the novels of Sir [[Walter Scott]] a particular favourite, in France and other European countries as much as Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, throughout; Strong, 30-32&lt;/ref&gt;  By the middle of the century medieval scenes were expected to be very carefully researched, using the work of historians of costume, architecture and all elements of decor that were becoming available. And example of this is the extensive research of Byzantine architecture, clothing and decoration made in Parisian museums and libraries by [[José Moreno Carbonero|Moreno Carbonero]] for his masterwork ''The Entry of Roger de Flor in Constantinople''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artehistoria.com/es/obra/entrada-de-roger-de-flor-en-constantinopla|title=Entrada de Roger de Flor en Constantinopla {{!}} artehistoria.com|website=www.artehistoria.com|language=es|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The provision of examples and expertise for artists, as well as revivalist industrial designers, was one of the motivations for the establishment of museums like the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 24-26, 47-73; Wright, 269-273&lt;/ref&gt;  New techniques of [[printmaking]] such as the [[chromolithograph]] made good quality [[monochrome]] print reproductions both relatively cheap and very widely accessible, and also hugely profitable for artist and publisher, as the sales were so large.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Historical painting often had a close relationship with [[Nationalism]], and painters like Matejko in Poland could play an important role in fixing the prevailing historical narrative of national history in the popular mind.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 32-36&lt;/ref&gt;  In France, ''[[L'art Pompier]]'' ("Fireman art") was a derisory term for official academic historical painting,&lt;ref&gt;Harding, throughout&lt;/ref&gt; and in a final phase, "History painting of a debased sort, scenes of brutality and terror, purporting to illustrate episodes from Roman and Moorish history, were Salon sensations.  On the overcrowded walls of the exhibition galleries, the paintings that shouted loudest got the attention".&lt;ref&gt;White, 91&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] painting was an alternative genre that offered similar exotic costumes and decor, and at least as much opportunity to depict sex and violence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1823">'''Jacques Bouillart''' (1669 &amp;ndash; 11 December 1726) was a [[Benedictine]] monk of the [[Congregation of Saint Maur|Congregation of St.-Maur]].

Bouillart was born in the [[Diocese of Chartres]]. He professed at the Monastery of St. Faron de Meaux in 1687. He was the author of ''Histoire de l'abbaye royale de [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]]'' (Paris, 1724). This history of the Benedictine monastery contains biographies of the abbots that ruled over it, since its foundation by [[Childeric I]] in 543, along with historical events related to the abbey. It also contains many illustrations and detailed descriptions of architecture, art and historical documents. Bouillart also edited a [[martyrology]] of [[Martyrology of Usuard|Usuard]]. In this publication he attempted to establish the genuineness and authenticity of the manuscript preserved at Saint-Germain-des-Prés, against the Jesuit [[hagiography|hagiographer]] Père [[Jean-Baptiste Du Sollier]] (1669–1740), who in his revised edition of Usuard's martyrology had paid no attention to this manuscript.

'''John Desmond Bernal''' {{post-nominals|size=100%|FRS}}&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; ({{IPAc-en|b|ər|ˈ|n|ɑː|l}}; 10 May 1901&amp;nbsp;– 15 September 1971) was an Irish scientist who pioneered the use of [[X-ray crystallography]] in [[molecular biology]]. He published extensively on the [[history of science]]. In addition, Bernal was a political supporter of [[communism]] and wrote popular books on science and society.

==Education and early life==
His family was Irish, of mixed Italian and Spanish/Portuguese&lt;ref&gt;Bevis Marks Records, Vols 1–6 of the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish Congregation, London; Miriam Rodrigues Pereira, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sephardic]] Jewish origin on his father's side (his grandfather Jacob Genese, properly ''Ginesi'', had adopted the family name Bernal of his paternal grandmother around 1837).&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; His father Samuel Bernal had been raised as a [[Catholic]] in [[Limerick]] and after graduating from [[Albert Agricultural College]] spent 14 years in Australia before returning to [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] to buy a farm, ''Brookwatson'', near [[Nenagh]] where Bernal was brought up. His American mother, née Elizabeth Miller, whose mother was from [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]], was a graduate of [[Stanford University]] and a journalist and had converted to Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Andrew |title=J. D. Bernal: the sage of science |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-19-851544-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2005|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernal was educated in England, first for one term at [[Stonyhurst College]] which he hated. Because of this he was moved to [[Bedford School]] at the age of thirteen. There, according to Goldsmith, for five years from 1914 to 1919 he found it "extremely unpleasant" and most of his fellow students "bored him" though his younger brother Kevin who was also there was "some consolation"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldsmith|1980|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brown claims "he seemed to adjust easily to life" there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2005|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, he went to [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] with a scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldsmith|1980|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boy&gt;{{cite book|last=Boylan|first= Henry |year=1998|title=A Dictionary of Irish Biography, 3rd Edition|pages=25|location=Dublin|publisher= Gill and MacMillan|isbn= 0-7171-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Cambridge, Bernal read both mathematics and science for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1922, which he followed by another year of [[natural science]]s. He taught himself the theory of [[space group]]s, including the [[quaternion]] method; this became the mathematical basis of a lengthy paper on [[crystal structure]] for which he won a joint prize with [[Ronald G.W. Norrish]] in his third year. Whilst at Cambridge, he also became known as "Sage", a nickname given to him about 1920 by a young woman working in [[Charles Kay Ogden]]'s Bookshop at the corner of [[Bridge Street, Cambridge|Bridge Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldsmith|1980|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
After graduation, Bernal began research under [[William Henry Bragg]] at the Davy Faraday Laboratory at the [[Royal Institution]]&lt;ref name="Oxon"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year=1999 |title=A Dictionary of Scientists |pages= |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-280086-8 |author=editors, John Dintih, Derek Gjertsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; in London. In 1924 he determined the structure of [[graphite]] (the Bernal stacking describes the registry of two graphite planes) and also did work on the crystal structure of [[bronze]].&lt;ref name ="Oxon"/&gt; His strength was in analysis as much as experimental method, and his mathematical and practical treatment of determining crystal structure was widely studied, though he also developed an X-ray spectro-[[goniometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2005|p=55,61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, he was appointed as the first lecturer in Structural Crystallography at Cambridge, becoming the assistant director of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in 1934. Here he started applying his crystallographic techniques to organic molecules, starting with [[oestrin]] and sterol compounds including [[cholesterol]] in 1929, forcing a radical change of thinking among sterol chemists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2005|p=94}} Goldsmith reports Zuckerman and Crowther were surprised Bernal was not awarded a Nobel for this, as it corrected the structure for which the 1928 award had been made.&lt;/ref&gt; While at Cambridge, he analysed [[vitamin B1|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] (1933), [[pepsin]] (1934), [[vitamin D2|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (1935), the [[sterols]] (1936), and the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (1937).&lt;ref name="Oxon"/&gt;

He also worked on the structure of liquid water, showing the boomerang shape of its molecule (1933). It was in Bernal's research group where, following a year working with Tiny Powell at Oxford, [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] continued her early research career.&lt;ref name=dphd/&gt; Together, in 1934, they took the first X-ray photographs of hydrated [[X-ray crystallography#crystalization|protein crystal]]s using the trick of bathing the crystals in their mother liquor, giving one of the first glimpses of the world of molecular structure that underlies living things.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7746 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Max Perutz]] arrived as a student from [[Vienna]] in 1936 and started the work on [[haemoglobin]] that would occupy him most of his career.

However, Bernal was refused fellowships at Emmanuel and Christ's and tenure by [[Ernest Rutherford]], who disliked him,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2005|pp=90,146,187}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1937, Bernal became Professor of [[Physics]] at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College, University of London]], a department which had been brought to the first rank by [[Patrick Blackett]]. The same year he was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; After World War II he established Birkbeck's Biomolecular Research Laboratory in two Georgian houses in Torrington Square with 15 researchers.  [[Aaron Klug]] worked on [[ribonuclease]] whilst [[Andrew Donald Booth|Andrew Booth]] developed some of the earliest computers to help with the computation. [[Rosalind Franklin]] joined from King's College and did pioneering work on viruses until her early death in 1957.

His [[Guthrie lecture]] of 1947 concentrated on proteins as the basis of life, but it was Perutz, still at Cambridge, who picked up [[Linus Pauling]]'s leads. In the early 1960s, Bernal returned to the subject of the origin of life&amp;nbsp;— analysing meteorites for evidence of complex molecules&amp;nbsp;— and to the topic of the structure of liquids, which he talked about in his [[Bakerian lecture]] in 1962.

===Ministry of Home Security===
In the early thirties Bernal had been arguing for peace, but the [[Spanish Civil War]] changed that. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Bernal joined the [[Ministry of Home Security]], where he brought in [[Solly Zuckerman]] to carry out the first proper analyses of the effects of enemy bombing and of explosions on animals and people. Their subsequent analysis of the effects of bombs on [[Birmingham]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] showed that city bombing produced little disruption and production was only affected by direct hits on factories. A supper of scientists in [[Soho]] generated a multi-author book ''Science in War'' produced in a month by [[Allen Lane]], one of the guests, arguing that science should be applied in every part of the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2005|pp=198–9, 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1942 he and Zuckerman served as scientific advisers to [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], the Chief of Combined Operations.&lt;ref name="Oxon"/&gt; Bernal was able to argue on both sides of [[Project Habbakuk]], [[Geoffrey Pyke|Pyke's]] proposal to build huge aircraft landing platforms in the North Atlantic made of ice. He rescued Max Perutz from internment, getting him to perform experiments on ice related to Habbakuk in a meat store freezer below [[Smithfield Meat Market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2005|pp=215–20,235–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project indirectly marked his divergence from Zuckerman, when he was recalled from a joint tour of the Middle East investigating the cooperation of army and air force, although the tour established Zuckerman's reputation as a military scientist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2005|pp=222–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Overlord and D-Day===

After the disaster of the [[Dieppe raid]], Bernal was determined that these mistakes not be repeated in [[Operation Overlord|Operation ''Overlord'']]. He demonstrated the advantages of an artificial harbour to the participants of the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943, as the only British scientist present. But his main contribution to the [[Normandy landings]] was the detailed mapping of the beaches which had to be done without attracting any German attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2005|pp=238–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; His knowledge of the area stemmed from research in English libraries, personal experience (he had visited [[Arromanches]] on previous holidays) and aerial surveys.&lt;ref name="Goldsmith 1980 105–108"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldsmith|1980|pp=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Bernal's memorial service, Zuckerman downplayed Bernal's part in the Normandy landings, saying he was not cleared for the highest levels of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2005|pp=477–484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given Bernal's Marxist and pro-Soviet sympathies it is perhaps remarkable that there has never been any suggestion that he fed any information in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2005|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Brown provides evidence&lt;ref name ="Science"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=de Charadevian, Soraya, Dept of History and Philosophy of Science, Cambridge | title=Advocating Science for the People&amp;nbsp;— review of Andrew Brown's book | year=2006 | publisher=Science 12 May 2006 Vol 312, no 5775| pages=849–850 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coker"&gt;{{cite news |title=Solly Zuckerman and J D Bernal, ''Times'' review by Christopher Coker of both Andrew Brown's biography of Bernal and Bernard Donovan's biography of Zukerman, 8 February 2006 |url=http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25350-2030656,00.html |accessdate=7 November 2008 |location=London |work=The Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621171931/http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C25350-2030656%2C00.html |archivedate=21 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Bernal's contributions to the preparation and the success of the invasion.

After assisting in the preparations for [[D-Day]] with work on the structure of the proposed landing sites and the [[bocage]] countryside beyond, Bernal landed, according to [[C. P. Snow]], at [[Normandy]] on the afternoon of D-Day+1 in the uniform of an Instructor-Lieutenant [[Royal Navy|RN]] to record the effectiveness of the plans. He also assisted boats floundering on the rocks using his knowledge of the area but said: "I committed the frightful [[solecism]] of not knowing which was [[Port (nautical)|port]] and which side was [[starboard]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldsmith|1980|pp=102–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
His 1929 work ''The World, the Flesh and the Devil'' has been called "the most brilliant attempt at scientific prediction ever made" by [[Arthur C. Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Arthur C.|title=Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds|publisher=St Martin's Griffin, New York|year=2000}} cited in {{harvnb|Brown|2005|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is famous for having been the first to propose the so-called [[Bernal sphere]], a type of [[Space colonization|space habitat]] intended for permanent residence. The second chapter explores radical changes to human bodies and intelligence and the third discusses the impact of these on society.

In ''The Social Function of Science'' (1939) he argued that science was not an individual pursuit of abstract knowledge and that the support of research and development should be dramatically increased. [[Eugene Garfield]], originator of the [[Science Citation Index]], said "his idea of a centralized reprint center was in my thoughts when I first proposed the as yet nonexistent SCI in Science in 1955."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Eugene Garfield |title=Tracing the Influence of JD Bernal on the World of Science through Citation Analysis |url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/bernaldublin0907.pdf |accessdate=2011-03-10 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Science in History]]'' (1954) is a monumental four-volume attempt to analyse the interaction between science and society. ''The Origin of Life'' (1967) gives the current ideas from [[Oparin]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane|Haldane]] onwards.

===Political activism===
Although raised as a Catholic in his childhood, Bernal became a socialist in Cambridge as a result of a long night arguing with a friend. He also became an atheist.&lt;ref name="Peter Haugen 2009 85"&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology: Decade by Decade |year=2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=9781438109770 |page=85 |author=Haugen, Peter |chapter=4: 1931-1940|quote=Although a devout Catholic in his boyhood, he became an outspoken atheist, socialist, and sometime Communist Party member...}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one reviewer, "This conversion, as complete as St. Paul's on the road to Damascus, goes some way to account for, but not excuse, Bernal's blind allegiance for the rest of his life, to the [[Soviet Union]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/21/2/302.full.pdf |title=J.D. Bernal: The Sage of Science |author=Jan A. Witkowski |accessdate=2011-03-01 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Witkowski | first1=J. A. | title=J. D.

Bernal became a  prominent [[intellectual]] in political life, particularly in the 1930s. He attended the famous 1931 meeting on the [[history of science]], where he met the Soviets [[Nikolai Bukharin]], and [[Boris Hessen]] who gave an influential [[Marxist]] account of the work of [[Isaac Newton]]. This meeting fundamentally changed his world-view and he maintained sympathy for the Soviet Union and [[Joseph Stalin]].  In 1939, Bernal published ''The Social Function of Science'', probably the earliest text on the [[sociology of science]].

After World War II, although Bernal had been involved in evaluating the effects of atomic attacks against the Soviet Union,&lt;ref name="Brown 2005 269"/&gt; he supported the ''[[World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace]]'' organised in [[communist Poland]] in 1948. Afterwards, he wrote a letter to the ''[[New Statesman]]'' warning that the US was preparing "a war for complete world domination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |publisher=New Statesman |title=Letter |volume=XXXVI |pages=238–239 |author=J.D. Bernal |date=18 September 1948|ref=harv}} quoted in {{harvnb|Brown|2005|p=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, when Bernal was invited to a world peace conference in New York in February 1949, his visa was refused. But he was allowed into France in April for the World Congress of the Partisans of Peace, with [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]] as president and Bernal as vice-president. The following year the organisation changed its name to the [[World Peace Council]].

On 20 September 1949, after his return from giving a speech strongly critical of western countries at a peace conference in Moscow, the ''[[Evening Star (Ipswich)|Evening Star]]'' newspaper of [[Ipswich]] published an interview with Bernal in which he endorsed Soviet agriculture, the "proletarian science" of [[Trofim Lysenko]].&lt;ref name="Goldsmith 1980 105–108"/&gt; The [[Lysenko affair]] had erupted in August 1948 when Stalin authorised Lysenko's theory of plant genetics as official Soviet orthodoxy, and refused any deviation. Bernal and the whole British scientific left were damaged by his support for Lysenko's theory, even after many scientists abandoned their sympathy for the Soviet Union.

Under pressure from the burgeoning [[Cold War]], the president of [[British Royal Society]] had resigned from the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] in November 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2005|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1949, the British Association for the Advancement of Science removed Bernal from membership of its council.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldsmith|1980|pp=182 et seq}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership in UK radical science groups quickly declined. Unlike some of his socialist colleagues, Bernal persisted in defending the Soviet position on Lysenko.  He publicly refused to accept the gaping fissures that the dispute revealed between the study of natural science and dialectical materialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldsmith|1980|pp=189 et seq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1950, [[Pablo Picasso]], a fellow communist, en route to a Soviet-sponsored&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, Interesting Times, p.&amp;nbsp;181&lt;/ref&gt; World Peace Congress in [[Sheffield]] created a mural in Bernal's flat at the top of No.&amp;nbsp;22 [[Torrington Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldsmith|1980|p=picture}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 this became part of the [[Wellcome Collection|Wellcome Trust's collection]]&lt;ref name="Picasso"&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article1599818.ece The night that Picasso was a little plastered], ''[[The Times]]'', 2 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Picasso2"&gt;[http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art53172 Bernal's Picasso goes on show in London at Wellcome Collection], [[Culture24]], UK, 14 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; for £250,000.

Throughout the 1950s, Bernal maintained a faith in the Soviet Union as a vehicle for the creation of a socialist scientific utopia. In 1953 he was awarded the [[Stalin Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name="BSE59"&gt;{{cite book|title=Yearbook of the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]|year=1959|publisher=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya |location=Moscow |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1959 to 1965 he was president of the [[World Peace Council]].

===Awards and honours===
Bernal was awarded the [[Royal Medal]] in 1945,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} the [[Guthrie lecture]] in 1947,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} the [[Stalin Peace Prize]] in 1953,{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} the Grotius Gold Medal in 1959{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and the [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1962.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Bernal was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].{{when|date=November 2017}} A fictional portrait of Bernal appears in the novel ''The Search'', an early work of his friend [[C. P. Snow]].  He was also said{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to be the inspiration for the character Tengal in ''The Holiday'' by [[Stevie Smith]]. The [[Bernal Lecture]] was named in his honour

==Personal life==
Bernal had two children (Mike, 1926–2016 and Egan, b.1930)&lt;ref name="Goldsmith 1980 238"/&gt; with his wife Agnes Eileen Sprague (referred to as Eileen),&lt;ref name ="NPG"/&gt; who was a secretary. He married Sprague on 21 June 1922, the day after having been awarded his BA degree. Bernal was 21, Sprague 23. Sprague was described as an active socialist and their marriage as 'open' which they both lived up to 'with great gusto'.&lt;ref name= "APBrown"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Brown | first1=A.

==Memoirs==

His memoirs give no insight into his early life. Instead, they begin in 1455, when an army under the command of [[Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]] laid [[siege]] to the [[castle]] of [[Novo Brdo]] for forty days. The Ottoman Army had marched from [[Edirne]] via [[Sofia]] in a campaign to establish certain control over the area that is now [[Kosovo]]. At the time, Novo Brdo was a rich mining city for [[silver]]. The garrison surrendered on June 1, 1455. According to Mihailović, the Sultan stood at the small gate of the castle and sorted the boys from the girls. He then sorted the women on one side of a ditch, and the men on the other. He then ordered all men of any distinguished rank or importance [[decapitated]]. The young women and girls, some 700 of them, were taken and married off to soldiers and Ottoman commanders. [http://www.kosovo.net/batak5.html]

Following this, the young boys, some 320 of them including Mihailović and his two brothers, were taken to be trained as members of the janissaries. He wrote later that he and nineteen other boys ran away during the night near a village called [[Samokovo]], only to be recaptured, bound, and beaten. The area in which he was referring to was most likely Samokovo in Serbia, located about 63 kilometers north of [[Pristina]], and 204 kilometers south of [[Belgrade]]. [http://nona.net/features/map/placedetail.1444974/Samokovo/] He writes that one year later he was present at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]]. While it is likely that he was present, he had not been with the Ottomans long enough to have become a janissary by that time. Mihailović goes into great detail about that siege and the events that followed.

===Campaign against Vlad III and in Bosnia===

After completing his janissary training, he next serves with the Ottoman Army during its advance against [[Vlad III]] of [[Wallachia]], who would later be the inspiration for the [[novel]] ''[[Dracula]]'' by [[Bram Stoker]]. In this segment, Mihailović confirms the use of [[impalement]] by Vlad III, and adds the fact that Vlad III often cut off the noses of Ottoman soldiers and sent them to [[Hungary]] to show the number of enemy soldiers he had killed. He states that in one battle, while the Ottomans were crossing the [[Danube]], some 250 janissaries were killed by the Wallachians, but the sheer numbers of the Ottoman force eventually drove Vlad III's forces away. 

He also records that during the night the Ottomans were most fearful of Wallachian attack, and that they protected their camps with wooden stakes and around the clock guards. This still did not prevent attacks, and they lost many soldiers, [[camel]]s and [[horse]]s. He gives some mention of the "forest of the impaled" that has since become [[legend]], in which Vlad III is alleged to have lined the roadways with thousands of impaled Turkish soldiers, but Mihailović never actually saw this, being in the rear of the army, thus writing about it on the word of others. 

His next writings were about the campaign to take [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1463–1878)|Bosnia]] in 1463. He details the sieges involved in that campaign, and as it comes to a close he and a garrison of janissaries are left to hold the [[fortress]] at [[Zvecaj]]. By this time he seems to have had a considerable rank. His force was not able to withstand a siege led by [[Matthias Corvinus]] of Hungary, and Mihailović was one of the prisoners taken. After his identity and ethnicity was discovered, he was repatriated back to his own country.

{{Lists of capitals}}
Throughout the world there are many '''cities that were once national [[Capital (political)|capitals]]''' but no longer have that status because the country ceased to exist, the capital was moved, or the capital city was [[Geographical renaming|renamed]]. This is a list of such cities, sorted by country and then by date. Where a city name has changed, the name of the city when it was a capital is listed first, followed by its modern name in brackets.

Note: [[Melbourne]] is sometimes said to have been the inaugural capital of Australia, from 1901 until 1927, when [[Parliament House, Canberra]] was opened.  This is not so.  Section 125 of the [[Constitution of Australia]] states that the seat of government is to be within the state of [[New South Wales]] but not less than 100 miles from [[Sydney]], and that until that place ([[Canberra]]) was built, the [[Parliament of Australia]] would meet at Melbourne.  That made Melbourne the ''de facto'' (but not ''de jure'') seat of government 1901-1927, but it did not amount to Melbourne being declared the capital, and it was never so described in contemporary documents.

A '''local museum''' or '''local history museum''' is  a [[museum]] that covers [[local history]]. Its collection normally includes objects with a local connection of some sort. Such museums are often small in nature and have a low budget for their running costs. Entry costs are normally low as well.&lt;ref&gt;Timo Tohmo, Economic value of a local museum: Factors of willingness-to-pay. ''[[Journal of Socio-Economics]]'', Volume 33, Issue 2, pages 229–240, April 2004. {{doi|10.1016/j.socec.2003.12.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A local museum covering a [[city]] is sometimes called a city museum and a local museum covering a town is sometimes called a town museum.

==History==
The first suggestion of establishing local museums in [[Great Britain|Britain]] was made by [[William Sharp (homeopath)|William Sharp]] in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Bernard Leary, ‘[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25223 Sharp, William (1805–1896)]’, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], [[Oxford University Press]], September 2004; online edn, October 2005. Accessed 22 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On the strength of this suggestion he was admitted to the [[Royal Society]].

==Regional variations==
In Germany, a specific type of local museum is a [[:de:Heimatmuseum|Heimatmuseum]], a museum dedicated to the unique German concept of [[heimat]], a form of local cultural identity.

==Biography==
Restall was born in a suburb of London, England, in 1964. He grew up in Spain, Venezuela, and East Asia, but was schooled in England, primarily at [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]], before going on to receive a BA degree in Modern History from [[Oxford University]] in 1986. He earned a PhD in Latin American History from UCLA in 1992, studying under [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]], and has since held teaching positions at various universities in the United States. Since 1995, Restall has published over twenty books and sixty articles &amp; essays. His best-known book is ''Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest'' (2003), which has also been published in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Polish.

His book ''The Black Middle: Africans, Mayas, and Spaniards in Colonial Yucatan'' won the Conference on Latin American History’s 2009 prize for best book on Mexican history. His newest book, ''When Montezuma met Cortés'' was published by HarperCollins in January 2018. He is currently writing a book on early Belize. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://restallmatthew.wixsite.com/restall | title  = Matthew Restall &amp;mdash; Official webpage | accessdate = 30 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madame Nguyễn Thị Định''' (15 March 1920 – 26 August 1992) was the first female general of  [[Vietnam People's Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. Her role in the war was as [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]] deputy commander, and was described as "the most important Southern woman revolutionary in the war"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~ebolt/history398/whowasnguyenthidinh.html|title=Who Was Nguyen Thi Dinh?|website=facultystaff.richmond.edu|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore she was commander of an all-female force known as the Long-Haired Army, whom engaged in espionage and combat against [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] and [[United States Army|US Forces]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/30/world/nguyen-thi-dinh-the-senior-woman-in-vietcong-ranks.html|title=Nguyen Thi Dinh, the Senior Woman In Vietcong Ranks|last=and|first=Wolfgang Saxon|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nguyễn Thị Định was born from a peasant family in [[Bến Tre Province]], and fought with the [[Viet Minh]] forces against the French. She was arrested and incarcerated by the [[French Indochina|French colonial authority]] between 1940–43, and helped lead an [[insurrection]] in Bến Tre in 1945, and again in 1960 (against the government of [[Ngô Đình Diệm]]). In that period, she lost her first husband and child while incarcerated by French authorities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/V_FFE679CC583A4C0DBE2EB15057EC5FCE|title=Vietnam: A Television History; Interview with Nguyen Thi Dinh, 1981|website=openvault.wgbh.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a founding member of the [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|National Liberation Front]] (NLF).

A portion of membership in the National Liberation Front continued to be women, and many were drawn to the promise of changes in the role of women in society&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

After the Vietnam War and the reunification of Vietnam, Madame Định served on the Central Committee of the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]] and also became the first female [[major general]] to serve in the [[Vietnam People's Army]]. She was also one of the [[Vice President of Vietnam|Deputy Chairmen of the Council of State]] from 1987 until her death. Together with Madame [[Nguyễn Thị Bình]], she is one of the two most prominent female Vietnamese communist leaders. She was awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] for 1967. In 1995, she was President posthumously awarded the title [[Hero of the People's Armed Forces]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

{{Marxism}}
{{Social democracy sidebar}}
[[File:Bernstein Eduard 1895.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Eduard Bernstein]], early revisionist]]
Within the [[Marxism|Marxist]] movement, the word '''revisionism''' is used to refer to various ideas, principles and theories that are based on a significant revision of fundamental Marxist premises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Revisionism 1. "A policy first put forward in the 1890s by Edward Bernstein (1850–1932) advocating the introduction of socialism through evolution rather than revolution, in opposition to the orthodox view of Marxists; hence a term of abuse used within the communist world for an interpretation of Marxism which is felt to threaten the canonical policy." with the first use in English "1903 ''Social-Democrat VII.'' 84 (''heading'') Revisionism in Germany."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is most often used by those Marxists who believe that such revisions are unwarranted and represent a "watering down" or abandonment of Marxism—one such common example is the negation of [[Class conflict#Marxist perspectives|class struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/1964/phnycom.htm |MAO TSE-TUNG July 1964 On Khrushchov’s Phoney Communism
and Its Historical Lessons for the World: ... the revisionist Khrushchov clique base themselves mainly on the argument that .. class struggle no longer exists.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, revisionism often carries [[pejorative]] connotations and the term has been used by many different factions. It is typically applied to others and rarely as a self-description. By extension, people who view themselves as fighting against revisionism have often self-identified as [[Anti-revisionism|anti-revisionists]].

== History ==
The term "revisionism" has been used in a number of contexts to refer to different revisions (or claimed revisions) of [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]].

=== 19th century ===
{{Missing information|the origins and impact of, and reaction to, revisionism|date=December 2016}}
In the late 19th century, revisionism was used to describe [[democratic socialist]] writers such as [[Eduard Bernstein]], who sought to revise [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas about the transition to socialism and claimed that a revolution through force was not necessary to achieve a socialist society.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Wolfgang Eichhorn: Über Eduard Bernstein. Gegensatz und Berührungspunkte zu Rosa Luxemburg und W. I. Lenin, in: [[Jahrbuch für Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No. I/2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The views of Bernstein gave rise to [[reformism|reformist]] theory, which asserts that socialism can be achieved through gradual peaceful reforms from within a capitalist system.&lt;ref&gt;Philip P. Wiener (ed). [http://etext.virginia.edu/DicHist/dict.html Dictionary of the History of Ideas], Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, in 1973–74. R. K. Kindersley [http://etext.virginia.edu/DicHist/dict.html Marxist revisionism: From Bernstein to modern forms], website of the [[University of Virginia]] Library. Accessed 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1920s and 1930s ===
In the 1920s and 1930s, the International [[Left Opposition]] led by [[Leon Trotsky]], which had been expelled from the [[Communist International]], accused the leadership of the Comintern and [[Soviet Union]] of revising the internationalist principles of Marxism and [[Leninism]] in favor of the aspirations of an [[Bourgeoisie|elite bureaucratic caste]] which had come to power in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1928/3rd/index.htm The Third International After Lenin], The Militant, 1929. Accessed 14 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] saw the nascent [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[bureaucracy]] as a roadblock on the [[proletariat]]'s path to [[World revolution|world socialist revolution]] and to the shifting policies of the Comintern, they counterposed the Marxist theory of [[permanent revolution]]. Meanwhile, the Soviet authorities labeled the Trotskyists as "revisionists" and eventually expelled them from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], whereupon the Trotskyists founded their [[Fourth International]].

=== 1940s and 1950s ===
In the 1940s and 1950s within the international [[communism|communist]] movement, revisionism was a term used by Marxist-Leninists to describe communists who focused on [[consumer goods]] production instead of [[heavy industry]]; accepted national differences instead of promoting [[proletarian internationalism]]; and encouraged [[Liberal socialism|liberal]] reforms instead of remaining faithful to established doctrine. Revisionism was also one of the charges leveled at [[Titoism|Titoists]] as punishment for their pursuit of a relatively independent communist ideology, amidst a series of post-[[World War II]] purges beginning in 1949 in [[Eastern Europe]] by the Soviet administration under Stalin. After Stalin's death, a more democratic form of [[socialism]] briefly became acceptable in [[Hungary]] during [[Imre Nagy]]'s government (1953–1955) and in [[Poland]] during [[Władysław Gomułka]]'s government, containing ideas that the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]] and the Soviet Union itself variously considered revisionist, although neither Nagy nor Gomułka described themselves as revisionists, since to do so would have been self-deprecating.

After the 1956 [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]] that denounced Stalin, many communist activists, astounded and disheartened by what they saw as the betrayal of [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] principles by the very people who had founded them, resigned from western communist parties in protest.{{fact|date=December 2016}} These quitters were sometimes accused of revisionism by those communists who remained in these parties, although some of these same loyalists also shortly thereafter split from the same communist parties in the 1960s to become the [[New Left]]{{fact|date=December 2016}} indicating that they too were disillusioned by the actions of the Soviet Union by that point in time. Most of those who left in the 1960s started aligning themselves with [[Mao Zedong]] as opposed to the Soviet Union.{{fact|date=December 2016}} An example was [[E. P. Thompson]]'s ''[[New Reasoner]]''.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

=== 1960s ===
In the early 1960s, Mao Zedong and the [[Communist Party of China]] revived the term revisionism ({{Lang-zh|修正主义}} ''xiūzhèng zhǔyì'', "doctrine correction") to attack [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and the Soviet Union over various ideological and political issues, as part of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. The Chinese routinely described the Soviets as "modern revisionists" through the 1960s. This usage was copied by the various [[Maoism|Maoist]] groups that split off from communist parties around the world. In 1978, the [[Sino-Albanian split]] occurred, which caused [[Enver Hoxha]], the [[Secretary (title)#Secretary-General|General Secretary]] of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], to also condemn Maoism as revisionist. This caused a split in the Maoist movement, with some following the [[Party of Labour of Albania|Albanian Party of Labour]]'s line, most notably the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]] and the [[Communist Party of Canada (Marxist–Leninist)]].

[[File:Prof. S. Irfan Habib.jpg|thumbnail]]
'''Syed Irfan Habib''' (born 1953) is an Indian historian of science and a public intellectual. He held the [[Abul Kalam Azad]] Chair at the [[National University for Educational Planning and Administration]] (NUEPA), New Delhi during 2009-2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuepa.org/new/Irfan_Habib.aspx|title=National University of Educational Planning and Administration - Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Chair|website=nuepa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/edit-page/S-Irfan-Habib-Modern-science-can-be-pursued-by-any-believer/articleshow/17052707.cms|title=S Irfan Habib: Modern science can be pursued by any believer|author=|date=|work=The Times of India|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before joining NUEPA, he was a scientist at the [[National Institute of Science, Technology and Development Studies]] (NISTADS), New Delhi.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Work==
Habib's intellectual collaboration with [[Dhruv Raina]] has initiated the publication of a series of articles and books on social history of science in India. For the last ten years, Habib has been writing and speaking about Islam and the decline of critical imagination.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} A book reflecting on this issue was published in 2012 called ''Jihad or Ijtihad'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=RWID1neRoucC&amp;pg=PT83&amp;dq=S+Irfan+habib+translation+Malayalam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJvJCUj-jLAhXXBY4KHdQzA7wQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=S+Irfan+habib+translation+Malayalam&amp;f=false|title=Jihad Or Itjihad : Religious Orthodoxy And Modern Science In Contemporary India|first=S. Irfan|last=Habib|date=1 December 2013|publisher=Harper Collins|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein he explores the critical traditions of Islamic scholarship in South Asia. An intellectual biography of [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]] locating him in the present day global Islamic context is forthcoming.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Habib's work on [[Bhagat Singh]] and his comrades (''To Make the Deaf Hear: Ideology and Programme of Bhagat Singh and His Comrades'', 2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threeessays.com/books/to-make-the-deaf-hear/|title=To Make the Deaf Hear: Ideology and Programme of Bhagat Singh and His Comrades - By S. Irfan Habib|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; established Bhagat Singh as a revolutionary ideologue of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association. Until a few years ago{{when|date=January 2018}} he was remembered only as a martyr, while Habib's reading of Bhagat Singh's original writings and archival sources presented him as a thinker. [[K. N. Panikkar|K.N. Panikkar]] in his review of the book underscores this by stating, "Irfan Habib's account is a meticulously documented and analytical work which takes particular care to portray the political and intellectual evolution of Bhagat Singh as a revolutionary. The focus of this work is not on events, but on the ideological processes which enabled Bhagat Singh to espouse a revolutionary philosophy and a programme of political action".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/Beyond-the-stereotype/article15410546.ece|title=Beyond the stereotype|date=5 February 2008|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4316">The '''School of Brentano''' was a group of [[philosophers]] and [[psychologists]] who studied with [[Franz Brentano]] and were essentially influenced by him. While it was never a school in the traditional sense, Brentano tried to maintain some cohesion in the school. However, two of his most famous students, [[Alexius Meinong]] and [[Edmund Husserl]], ultimately moved radically beyond his theories.

==Notable members==
Among the School of Brentano are counted several founders of new schools and movements (place and period they studied with Brentano):
*[[Carl Stumpf]] ([[Würzburg]], 1866&amp;ndash;1870), taught [[Aron Gurwitsch]] and became the head of the [[Berlin School of experimental psychology|Berlin School]] ([[Max Wertheimer]], [[Kurt Koffka]], [[Wolfgang Köhler]])
*[[Edmund Husserl]] ([[Vienna]], 1884&amp;ndash;1886), founded the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] movement, influencing:
**[[Munich phenomenology]] ([[Johannes Daubert]], [[Adolf Reinach]])
**[[existential phenomenology]] ([[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Martin Heidegger]])
*[[Alexius Meinong]] ([[Vienna]], 1875&amp;ndash;1878), was the head of the [[Graz School]], and he influenced among others [[Stephan Witasek]], [[Alois Höfler]], [[Vittorio Benussi]]
*[[Christian von Ehrenfels]], credited with the introduction of the notion of ''Gestalt'', which led to the establishment of [[Gestalt psychology]]
*[[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (Vienna, 1885&amp;ndash;1889), became father of the [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic]] ([[Jan Łukasiewicz]], [[Stanisław Leśniewski]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]] and [[Alfred Tarski]])
*[[Anton Marty]] ([[Würzburg]], 1866&amp;ndash;1870), developed a detailed theory of language with his disciple [[Karl Bühler]], which influenced Reinach (who developed a theory of speech acts long before [[J. L. Austin|John Austin]]), whose lectures were attended by [[Franz Kafka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Franz Kafka|year=2004|publisher=Chelsea House|location=Philadelphia|isbn=079107871X|page=28|author=Neil Heims}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Sigmund Freud]], founded [[psychoanalysis]]

Other students were:
*[[Alois Höfler]]
*[[Benno Kerry]]
*[[Tomáš Masaryk]]
*[[Rudolf Steiner]]

Scholars such as [[Roderick Chisholm]], [[George Edward Moore]], [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[John Searle]], [[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]], [[Kevin Mulligan]], [[Peter Simons (academic)|Peter Simons]] and [[Jan Woleński]] have propagated Brentano's influence to analytic philosophy through their research, editions and publications.

Through the works and teachings of his pupils the philosophy of Franz Brentano has been spread far and wide and indirectly influenced many if not most of the debates in [[contemporary philosophy]], cognitive science and philosophy of mind.

[[File:Solovjev S. M..jpg|thumb|Sergey Mikhaylovich Solovyov]]

'''Sergey Mikhaylovich Solovyov''' (Soloviev, Solovyev; {{lang-ru|Серге́й Миха́йлович Соловьёв}}) ({{OldStyleDate|17 May|1820|5 May}}, in [[Moscow]] &amp;ndash; {{OldStyleDate|16 April|1879|4 April}}, in Moscow) was one of the greatest [[Russia]]n historians whose influence on the next generation of Russian historians ([[Vasily Klyuchevsky]], [[Dmitry Ilovaisky]], [[Sergey Platonov]]) was paramount. His son [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] was one of the most influential Russian philosophers. His older son [[Vsevolod Solovyov]] was a historical novelist.

==Life and works==
Solovyov studied in the [[Moscow University]] under [[Timofey Granovsky]] and travelled in Europe as a tutor of Count [[Stroganov]]'s children until 1844. The following year he joined the staff of the [[Moscow University]], where he rose to the dean's position (1871&amp;ndash;77). He also administrated the [[Kremlin Armoury]] and acted as tutor to the future [[Alexander III of Russia]].

Solovyov's magnum opus was the ''History of Russia from the Earliest Times'', totally unprecedented in its scope and depth. From 1851 until his death, he published 29 volumes of this work. Among his other books, the ''History of Poland's Downfall'' (1863) and the ''Public Readings on Peter the Great'' (1872) were probably the most popular.

==Views and influence==
Solovyov appreciated Russia's position as the outpost of [[Christianity]] in the East. In his opinion, the Russian statehood resulted from a "natural and necessary development" of numerous political and social forces, which he attempted to trace. He took particular interest in the [[Time of Troubles]] and [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s reforms, which he described as temporary diseases of the organism of Russian state.

In the words of the 2004 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], his ''History'' "wove a vast body of data into a unified and orderly whole that provided an exceptionally powerful and vivid picture of Russia's political development over the centuries. The work inaugurated a new era in Russian scholarship with its depiction of Russia as evolving through organic and rational processes from a primitive, family-based society into a centralized, autocratic state".

The '''Seven Bishops''' of the [[Church of England]] were those imprisoned and tried for [[seditious libel]] related to their opposition to the second [[Declaration of Indulgence]], issued by [[James II of England|James II]] in 1688. In a major embarrassment to the Crown, they were found not guilty.

==Background==
The Declaration granted broad religious freedom in England by suspending penal laws that enforced conformity to the Church of England, by allowing persons to worship in their homes or chapels as they saw fit, and by ending affirming religious oaths as a requirement for employment in government office.

==Sequence of events==
The Declaration of Indulgence had originally been given out on 4 April 1687. The King republished it, with some new prefatory matter, on 25 April 1688. On 4 May the King and his council ordered the bishops that the declaration should be read in all the (Anglican) churches – those of London on 20 May and outside London on 27 May and the two following Sundays. This was the only way to make the document swiftly and generally known, which was James's straightforward object. The Anglican clergy felt it a challenge to themselves, for many of them were opposed to the toleration of Roman Catholics and Nonconformists, as were very many English people.

Nine days passed with no objection; then, on 13 May, at [[Lambeth Palace]], Compton (Bishop of London), Sancroft (Archbishop of Canterbury), Turner (Bishop of Ely) and White (Bishop of Peterborough), resolved to defy James's order.&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Tyte, Robert, ''Bloody Jeffreys: the hanging judge'', André Deutsch, London, 1989,  p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; They summoned seven others, of whom four actually came – Lake (Bishop of Chichester), Lloyd (St Asaph), Trelawny (Bristol) and Ken (Bath and Wells) – to a meeting of eight. Compton was under suspension following another dispute with the King. The others, known as the Seven Bishops, signed a petition requesting that they be excused; they claimed that the King did not have the legal right to make exemptions from statutes, the dispensing power having been declared illegal by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Edward, ''The Protestant Bishop: Being the Life of Henry Compton, 1632–1713, Bishop of London'', [[Longmans, Green and Co.]], 1956, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the King's power to dispense individuals from the provisions of a statute – that is to declare that the individual need not observe its provisions – had recently been reaffirmed in ''Godden v Hales''&lt;ref&gt;''State Trials'' Vol. IX pp1196-9&lt;/ref&gt; after James had dismissed judges he knew to be opposed to his exercise of it.  The  Lord Chief Justice, Sir [[Edward Herbert (judge)|Edward Herbert]],  had  ruled   in ''Godden v Hales''  that : "It is an indispensable prerogative in the Kings of England to dispense with  penal laws in particular cases, and upon particular necessary reasons...Of those reasons and those necessities the King himself is the sole judge."&lt;ref&gt;''State Trials''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of Friday, 18 May, the Seven Bishops (apart from Sancroft) presented their petition to the King, who read it and was furious. He proclaimed it "a standard of rebellion" and dismissed them, saying that he expected to be obeyed and that "God hath given me this dispensing power and I will maintain it."&lt;ref name=C117&gt;Carpenter, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was soon printed and distributed for sale on the streets of London; Compton may have been responsible for that.&lt;ref name=C117/&gt; The seven were put on trial for seditious libel.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The council were not sure what to do, but summoned the Bishops to appear before them on Friday 8 June,&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Tyte, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; which became known as Black Friday.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Macaulay, Thomas Babington]], ''The History Of England From the Accession of James II'', Vol. II, Chapter VIII, [[Donohue, Henneberry &amp; Co.]], 1890, p. 332. [[s:The History Of England From the Accession of James II/Chapter VIII#II.332]].&lt;/ref&gt; The bishops could have given their own [[recognizance]]s for coming up for trial, and thereby avoided being imprisoned before their trial. Sancroft had urged this; even Compton agreed to it; but Sancroft changed his mind. The bishops seem to have been angling for a delay in the trial proceedings – by refusing to give recognizances, they would have the right to delay the trial until the beginning of Michaelmas term on 23 October. The king, however, wanted a speedy trial, and the only way to get it, apart from convincing the Bishops to give their own recognizances, was to imprison them in the [[Tower of London]] before their trial; within the Tower, however, they had complete freedom.  Their imprisonment lasted only a week and had the effect, desired by the king, of speeding up the proceedings so that a trial could be held in June.&lt;ref&gt;Sowerby, Scott, ''Making Toleration: The Repealers and the Glorious Revolution'', Harvard University Press, 2013, pp. 178-81.&lt;/ref&gt; But, in [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s deliberately ironic words, "Compton had had the satisfaction of seeing a vast popular gathering acclaiming these fathers in God on the way to the horrid dungeon of a Tyrant."&lt;ref&gt;Belloc, Hilaire, "James the Second", Faber &amp; Gwyer, 1928, p. 216. The section from "The Declaration of Indulgence had originally" to this quotation is paraphrased from this book.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|Lord Jeffreys]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], advised the King to drop the prosecution; on being overruled he asked caustically if the King was prepared to take advice from his Ministers   or whether "the Virgin Mary is to do all".&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Tyte, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
The trial took place at the Court of [[King's Bench]] on 29 June, with Sir [[Thomas Powys (judge)|Thomas Powys]] the Attorney General and [[Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, of Gray's Inn|William Williams]] the Solicitor General prosecuting and Sir [[Robert Wright (judge)|Robert Wright]], the [[Lord Chief Justice]] as the presiding judge, sitting with [[John Powell (judge)|John Powell]], Richard Holloway and [[Richard Allibond]]. The bishops had a formidable team of defence counsel, headed by [[Francis Pemberton]], a former Lord Chief Justice, and including former Attorneys General [[Robert Sawyer (Attorney General)|Sir Robert Sawyer]] and [[Sir Creswell Levinz]], as well as [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|John Somers]], a future [[Lord Chancellor]].&lt;ref name=K391&gt;Kenyon, J.P., ''The Stuart Constitution'', 2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury deliberated all night and the bishops were found not guilty on the morning of 30 June. There was great rejoicing; those opposed to the royal dispensing power had gained their victory.

The verdict was a  political disaster for the Government, largely due to its own ineptitude. Of the four judges only Allibond, a [[Roman Catholic]], showed any real desire for a conviction, while Powell and Holloway would clearly be happy with an acquittal. Powys,  the Attorney General,  through sheer incompetence,   almost caused the case to collapse at the outset by failing to prove that the Petition had been presented at all;&lt;ref name=K391/&gt;  Williams, the Solicitor General, handled the case with greater skill, but his bitter personal feud with  Lord Chief Justice Wright  (who in the course of his summing-up to the jury  accused him, without any relevance whatever to the trial,  of taking bribes)&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; can scarcely have helped  the prosecution. A modern historian remarked that the trial "had a strong element of the grotesque".&lt;ref name=K391/&gt;

==Bishops==

The Seven Bishops were:

* [[William Sancroft]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]
* [[Thomas Ken]], [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]]
* [[John Lake (bishop)|John Lake]], [[Bishop of Chichester]]
* [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]], [[Bishop of St Asaph]]
* [[Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet|Jonathan Trelawny]], [[Bishop of Bristol]]
* [[Francis Turner (bishop)|Francis Turner]], [[Bishop of Ely]]
* [[Thomas White (bishop)|Thomas White]], [[Bishop of Peterborough]]

Despite their petition and their trial, five of these bishops (all but Lloyd and Trelawny) remained loyal to James II after the [[Glorious Revolution]] and were among the nine bishops who became [[Nonjuring schism|non-juror]]s, refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], and losing their bishoprics as a result.

==Rights of petition and religion==
The bishops exercised the right to petition preserved in ''[[Magna Carta]]'' (1215) (clause 61). The following year Parliament cited James II's trial of the Seven Bishops as a grievance. It explicitly preserved the right of petition in the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] (1689).
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]he said Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons,&amp;nbsp;... do in the first place (as their ancestors in like case have usually done) for the vindicating and asserting their ancient rights and liberties declare&amp;nbsp;...
That it is the right of the subjects to petition the king, and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal;&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These rights of petition for redress of grievances and of religion and conscience were preserved in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4344">The '''Stone Cattle Road''' ({{zh|c=石牛道|p=Shíniú Dào}}) was an ancient Chinese road over the [[Qinling Mountains]] used by the state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] to conquer [[Sichuan]] in 316 BC.

==Story==
The story goes that King [[Huiwen of Qin]] on the [[Wei River]] wished to conquer the kingdom of [[Shu (state)|Shu]] to the south over the [[Qinling Mountains]] in the [[Sichuan Basin]].  He therefore had his sculptors make five life-sized stone cows. He decorated their tails and hindquarters with gold and placed them where the Shu ambassadors could see them. When the king of Shu heard of this he thought it would be good to fertilize his treasury with golden cowpats, so he asked the king of Qin to send him some cattle. The king of Qin replied that the cattle were delicate and that to deliver them it would first be necessary to build a [[gallery road]] over the mountains. When this Stone Cattle Road was completed in 316 BC he used it to invade and conquer Shu.&lt;ref&gt;John Keay, China - A History,2009, pp. 80–83&lt;/ref&gt; Sage gives a slightly different version of the story. Another source&lt;ref&gt;M Kennelly(1908) translation of L Richard(1905), 'Comprehensive Geography of the Chinese Empire', page 45&lt;/ref&gt; mentions a Golden Ox Road ({{zh|s=金牛道||p=Jīnniú dào}}) which passes through the western end of the [[Qinling Mountains]] over the Tianshaling and Wuting passes. Legend says it was built to seize oxen of a similar nature that lived in the mountains.

==History==

In order to reach Sichuan from Qin one must travel south over the difficult Qinling Mountains to the [[Han River (Yangtze River tributary)|Han River]] basin and then southwest over the [[Daba Mountains]] to the [[Sichuan Basin]]. Naturally there were footpaths, but sending an army, and the later extraction of tribute, required a road suitable for wheeled vehicles. For the more difficult sections a [[gallery road]] had to be constructed. Horizontal holes were bored into the rock and logs inserted in them. Where possible, vertical logs were placed to support the outer ends and the whole was covered with planks. (In 1979 Chinese archeologists located 56 horizontal holes and 190 vertical holes in 22 different locations.) If the Qin invasion of 316BC was a sudden decision provoked by the Marquis of Zu's quarrel with the King of Shu then the road, or part of it, must have been in place before this. The more difficult northern part was in Qin territory, the southern part in Shu and the middle part in Ba, although the exact boundaries are not clear. Most of the expense and engineering must have come from Qin. Given that the distance from the Wei valley to [[Chengdu]] is about 500 kilometers, it is unlikely that the whole road was built at once.

Sage remarks that "determining the Qinling portion of the route was once one of those perennial quibbles like the attempts to find Hannibal's path through the Alps." His view is that the Qinling portion corresponds to the Baoxie Plank Road. This ran from southeast of the Qin capital of [[Fengxiang County|Yong]], up the north-flowing Xie River, over a pass west of [[Mount Taibai]] and southwest down the Bao River to [[Hanzhong]] on the Han River. From there it went west-southwest over the Daba Mountains using the Wu Deng Pass ('Wu Deng' were the 'Five Strongmen' who carried the cattle to Shu) and entered the Sichuan Basin at the Jian Men or Sword Gate, a route that is similar to the modern Xi'an-Chengdu highway. Sage thinks that the Stone Cattle Road proper was the segment south of the Daba Mountains, although the term was used loosely for the whole route. There was also an 'old road' ('gu dao') west of the Qinling portion which [[Liu Bang]] used for his initial breakout of the Han valley. This probably corresponds to the modern S210 highway. After the conquest there was a 'Rice Granary Road' that went south from Hanzhong and then swung west. As Sichuan became more developed there were other roads of greater or lesser importance.

Raised on Tahiti, she was educated at the missionary school run by [[William Howe (missionary)|William Howe]] and his wife in Papeete. She became fluent in French, English and Tahitian.&lt;ref name="BishopMuseum1971" /&gt; 

==Career==
Becoming a school teacher, she taught French and English at the Viennot School in Papeete for twenty years.&lt;ref name="BishopMuseum1971" /&gt; From 1890 to 1906, Henry also taught in the [[Royal School (Hawaii)|Royal School]] and Kaahumanu School in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="Death" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Education1901"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hawaii.

Henry's maternal grandfather Orsmond had collected significant amounts of oral histories, genealogy, myths, folklore and traditional knowledge such as astronomy and navigation while living in Tahiti between 1817 and his death in 1856. In 1848, he had presented a manuscript about the history of Tahiti to French colonial official [[Charles François Lavaud]], but it was lost before it could be published in Paris.&lt;ref name="Craig2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmond2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salmond|first=Anne|title=Aphrodite's Island: The European Discovery of Tahiti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QNomAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During her lifetime, Henry would reconstruct this lost manuscript by transcribing the original notes he left behind.&lt;ref name="Craig2011" /&gt;
Henry collected further similar material, translated and notated the material and wrote articles that were published by journals such as the ''[[Journal of the Polynesian Society]]''.&lt;ref name="BishopMuseum1971" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_16_1907/Volume_16,_No._2/Tahitian_astronomy,_by_Miss_Teuira_Henry,_p_101-104/p1|title=Journal of the Polynesian Society: Tahitian Astronomy, By Miss Teuira Henry|pages=101&amp;ndash;104|website=www.jps.auckland.ac.nz|access-date=2018-07-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205102247/http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_16_1907/Volume_16%2C_No._2/Tahitian_astronomy%2C_by_Miss_Teuira_Henry%2C_p_101-104/p1|archive-date=5 February 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peoples of the Pacific: The History of Oceania to 1870|last=D'Arcy|first=Paul|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The World of the Bible''''', published by [[Bayard Presse]], is a 150-page quarterly review that offers a historical, archeological, and artistic approach to the biblical universe. It succeeded Bible and Terre Sainte ([[Bible]] and Holy Land), {{ISSN|0006-0712}}, a periodical published by the eponymous organization from 1957 to 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.theworldofthebible.com/about-us/|website=The World of the Bible|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor in chief of The World of the Bible is Benoît de Sagazan since October 2008.

Due to its editorial style, The World of the Bible is more appropriately called a review than a magazine. Its writers and contributors are often authorities in their disciplines, which vary from exegesis, history of religions, archeology, to art history.

Established scholars, such as Thomas Römer (professor at the Collège de France), Daniel Marguerat ([[University of Lausanne]]), Marie-Françoise Baslez (Sorbonne), Michel Quesnel ([[Catholic University of Lyon]]), Simon Claude Minouni (EPHE), Régis Burnet ([[Catholic University of Louvain-la-Neuve]]), Bertrand Lafond (CNRS), François Brossier (professor emeritus at the Catholic Institute of Paris), and archeologist Estelle Villeneuve (Maison René Ginouvès of archeology and ethnology, Nanterre), preside over its editorial and scientific committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les Auteurs et Chercheurs du Monde de la Bible|url=http://prod.mondedelabible.com/les-auteurs-et-chercheurs-du-monde-de-la-bible/|website=Le Monde de la Bible|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review publishes English and French e-books in the fields mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebook|url=http://www.theworldofthebible.com/ebook/|website=The World of the Bible|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National missile defense''' ('''NMD''') is a generic term for a type of [[missile defense]] intended to shield an entire country against incoming missiles, such as [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBMs) or other [[ballistic missiles]].

[[File:EKV prototype launch.jpg|thumb|300px|A Payload Launch Vehicle (PLV) carrying a prototype exoatmospheric kill vehicle is launched from [[Meck Island]] at the [[Kwajalein]] Missile Range on 3 December 2001, for an intercept of a ballistic missile target over the central Pacific Ocean.]]

This is also used to refer to the [[United States|American]] nationwide antimissile program the [[United States]] has had in development since the 1990s. After the renaming in 2002, the term now refers to the entire program, not just the ground-based interceptors and associated facilities. This article focuses mainly on this system and a brief history of earlier systems which led to it.

Other elements yet to be integrated into NMD may include [[anti-ballistic missiles]], or sea-based, space-based, laser, and high altitude missile systems. The NMD program is limited in scope and designed to counter a relatively small ICBM attack from a less sophisticated adversary. Unlike the earlier [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] program, it is not designed to be a robust shield against a large attack from a technically sophisticated adversary.

==Definitions==
The term "national missile defense" has several meanings:

* (Most common, but now [[Deprecated#Other usage|deprecated]]:) U.S. National Missile Defense, the limited ''ground-based'' nationwide antimissile system in development since the 1990s. In 2002 this system was renamed to [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]] (GMD), to differentiate it from other missile defense programs, such as space-based, sea-based, laser, robotic, or high-altitude intercept programs. As of 2006, this system is operational with limited capability. It is designed to intercept a small number of nuclear-armed ICBMs in the mid-course phase, using interceptor missiles launched from within the United States in [[Alaska]]. They use non-nuclear [[Projectile#Kinetic projectiles|kinetic warheads]].
* Any national ICBM defense by any country, past or present. The U.S. [[Sentinel program]] was a planned national missile defense during the 1960s, but was never deployed. Elements of Sentinel were actually deployed briefly as the [[Safeguard Program]], although it wasn't national in scope. The [[Russia]]n [[A-135 anti-ballistic missile system]] is currently operational only around the city of [[Moscow]], the national capital, and is far from being national in scope in Russia.
* Any national missile defense (against any missile type) by any country. [[Israel]] currently has a national missile defense against short and medium-range missiles using their [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow missile]] system.

See [[Missile defense#Trajectory phase|trajectory phase]] for the types of anti-ballistic missiles, the advantages and the disadvantages of each implementation type. The role of defense against nuclear missiles has been a heated military and political topic for several decades. (See also [[nuclear strategy]], [[Missile Defense Agency]], and [[anti-ballistic missile]].) But missile defense against a known ballistic  missile trajectory has to be rethought in the face of a maneuverable threat (such as a [[hypersonic glide vehicle]], which still has yet to be realized and proven, as of 2018).

==History of national missile defense systems==
When the [[United States Air Force]] was split from the [[United States Army]] in 1947, the Army retained the role of ground based air defenses that would evolve into National missile defense.  The Army retained the lead role in this area until the success of the Aegis system shifted the focus to the [[United States Navy]] in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lexington Institute|Thompson, Loren B.]] [https://blogs.forbes.com/beltway/2011/03/21/missile-defense-becomes-a-navy-mission/ "Missile Defense Becomes A Navy Mission."] ''Forbes'', 21 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nike-Zeus===
{{main|LIM-49 Nike Zeus}}

In the 1950s, a series of [[Surface-to-air missile|anti-aircraft missile]]s were developed as part of [[Project Nike]]. The latest in the series, Nike-Zeus, offered extremely long-range interception and very high performance.  In the late 1950s, the program investigated the use of Nike-Zeus missiles as interceptors against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ICBMs. A Nike warhead would be detonated at high altitudes (over 100&amp;nbsp;km, or 60 statute miles) above the polar regions in the near vicinity of an incoming Soviet missile.

The problem of how to quickly identify and track incoming missiles proved intractable, especially in light of easily envisioned countermeasures such as [[decoy]]s and [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]]. At the same time, the need for a high-performance anti-aircraft weapon was also seriously eroded by the obvious evolution of the Soviet nuclear force to one based almost entirely on ICBMs. The Nike-Zeus project was canceled in 1961.

===Project Defender===
The Nike-Zeus use of nuclear warheads was necessary given the available missile technology. However, it had significant technical limitations such as blinding defensive radars to subsequent missiles. Also,  exploding nuclear warheads over friendly territory (albeit in space) was not ideal. In the 1960s Project Defender and the Ballistic Missile Boost Intercept (BAMBI) concept replaced land-launched Nike missiles with missiles to be launched from satellite platforms orbiting directly above the USSR.  Instead of nuclear warheads, the BAMBI missiles would deploy huge wire meshes designed to disable Soviet ICBMs in their early launch phase (the "boost phase"). No solution to the problem of how to protect the proposed satellite platforms against attack was found, however, and the program was canceled in 1968.

===Sentinel Program===
{{main|Sentinel program}}
In 1967,&lt;ref&gt;

|quote=Instead, on September 18, 1967, he announced the Sentinel ABM system.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[U.S. Defense Secretary]] [[Robert McNamara]] announced the Sentinel Program, providing a defense against attack for most of the continental United States. The system consisted of a long range [[LIM-49A Spartan|Spartan missile]], the short range [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint missile]], and associated radar and computer system. However, U.S. military and political strategists recognized several problems with the system:&lt;ref&gt;Air Defense Artillery Magazine, May – June 1995 issue [http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/vigilant/chap3.html Vigilant and Invincible] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224062029/http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/vigilant/chap3.html |date=24 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federation of American Scientists: Ballistic Missile Defense https://fas.org/spp/starwars/congress/1996_h/h960927l.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Missile Defence: International, Regional and National Implications, edited by Bertel Heurlin, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deployment of even a limited defensive [[Anti-ballistic missile|ABM]] system might invite a preemptive nuclear attack before it could be implemented
* Deploying ABM systems would likely invite another expensive arms race for defensive systems, in addition to maintaining existing offensive expenditures
* Then-current technology did not permit a thorough defense against a sophisticated attack
* Defended coverage area was very limited due to the short range of the missiles used
* Use of nuclear warheads on antimissile interceptors would degrade capability of defensive radar, thus possibly rendering defense ineffective after the first few interceptions
* Political and public concern about detonating defensive nuclear warheads over friendly territory
* An ICBM defense could jeopardize the [[Mutual assured destruction|Mutual Assured Destruction]] concept, thus being a destabilizing influence

===Safeguard Program===
[[File:Safeguard insignia.png|thumb|The Institute of Heraldry approved the shoulder sleeve insignia for Safeguard.]]

{{main|Safeguard Program}}

In 1969 Sentinel was renamed 'Safeguard'.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was from then on dedicated to the protection of some of the U.S. ICBM-silo areas from attack, promoting their ability to mount a retaliatory missile attack. Safeguard used the same [[LIM-49A Spartan|Spartan]] and [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] missiles, and the same radar technology as Sentinel. Safeguard solved some problems of Sentinel:

* It was less expensive to develop due to its limited geographic coverage and fewer required missiles.
* It avoided a lot of hazards to the public of defensive nuclear warheads detonated in the atmosphere nearby, since the Safeguard system was located in and near sparsely populated areas of the Dakotas, Montana, [[Manitoba]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Alberta]].
* It provided better interception probabilities due to dense coverage by the shorter-range Sprint missiles, which were unable to cover the entire defended area under the larger and earlier proposed Sentinel program.

However Safeguard still retained several of the previously listed political and military problems.

===ABM treaty===
These above issues drove the United States and the [[USSR]] to sign the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] of 1972. Under the ABM treaty and the 1974 revision of it, each country was allowed to deploy a single ABM system with only 100 interceptors to protect a single target. The Soviets deployed a system named the [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system|A-35 "Galosh"]] missile system, and it was deployed to protect [[Moscow]], its capital city. The U.S. deployed the [[Safeguard Program|Safeguard system]] to defend the ICBM launch sites around the [[Grand Forks Air Force Base]], North Dakota, in 1975. The American Safeguard system was only briefly operational (for a matter of several months). The Soviet system (now called [[A-135 anti-ballistic missile system|A-135]]) has been improved over the decades, and it is still operational around Moscow.

===Homing Overlay Experiment===
[[File:SO4 Hoe open Web.jpg|thumb|Homing Overlay Experiment open web]]

Given concerns about the previous programs using nuclear tipped interceptors, in the 1980s the U.S. Army began studies about the feasibility of hit-to-kill vehicles, where an interceptor missile would destroy an incoming ballistic missile just by colliding with it, the so-called "Kinetic Kill Vehicles", or KKV.

The first program which actually tested a hit-to-kill missile interceptor was the Army's Homing Overlay Experiment. "Overlay" was the Army's term for exo-atmospheric interceptions, which would have to declutter any decoys, "underlay" was their term for high-altitude interceptions within the atmosphere. The KKV was equipped with an infrared seeker, guidance electronics and a propulsion system. Once in space, the KKV extended a 4&amp;nbsp;m (13&amp;nbsp;ft) diameter structure similar to an umbrella skeleton to enhance its effective cross section. This device would destroy the ICBM reentry vehicle on collision.  After test failures with the first three flight tests, the fourth and final test on 10 June 1984 was successful, intercepting the Minuteman RV with a closing speed of about 6.1&amp;nbsp;km/s at an altitude of more than 160&amp;nbsp;km.

===Strategic Defense Initiative===
[[File:Sdilogo.svg|thumb|SDI insignia]]
{{main|Strategic Defense Initiative}}

On 23 March 1983, President [[Ronald Reagan]] announced a new national missile defense program formally called the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] but soon nicknamed "Star Wars" by detractors.  President Reagan's stated goal was not just to protect the U.S. and its allies, but to also provide the completed system to the USSR, thus ending the threat of nuclear war for all parties. SDI was technically very ambitious and economically very expensive. It would have included many space-based laser battle stations and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites designed to intercept hostile ICBMs in space, along with very sophisticated [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] systems. Unlike the previous Sentinel program, the goal was to totally defend against a robust, all out nuclear attack by the USSR.

A partisan debate ensued in Congress, with [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] questioning the feasibility and strategic wisdom of such a program, while [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] talked about its strategic necessity and provided a number of technical experts who argued that it was in fact feasible (including [[Manhattan Project]] physicist [[Edward Teller]]).  Advocates of SDI prevailed and funding was initiated in fiscal year 1984.

===Withdrawal from ABM Treaty===
In December 1999, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] approved a resolution aimed at pressing the United States to abandon its plans to build an anti-missile missile defense system. Voting against the draft, along with the United States, were three other countries, [[Albania]], [[Israel]], and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. Thirteen of the 15 members of the [[European Union]] abstained, and [[France]] and [[Ireland]] voted in favor of this resolution. The resolution called for continued efforts to strengthen and preserve the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters via Space.com. [http://www.space.com/news/un_antimissile_991202_wg.html U.N. Opposes U.S. Plan for Antimissile Defense] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707051422/http://www.space.com/news/un_antimissile_991202_wg.html |date=7 July 2009 }}. 2 December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 June 2002, the United States withdrew from the [[ABM Treaty]]. On the following day, Russia responded by withdrawing from [[START II]] treaty (intended to ban [[MIRV]] ICBMs). More specifically, then President Bush stated that the USA withdrew from the treaty.  There was no Senate "anti-ratification" treaty action similar to what was required by law to first ratify or accept the treaty.

==Current NMD program==
===Goals===

[[File:NationalGuardMissileDefenseLogo.PNG|right|frame|The logo of the Missile Defense division of the [[U.S. National Guard]], part of the modern American missile defense system]]

In the 1990s and early 21st century, the stated mission of NMD has changed to the more modest goal of preventing the United States from being subject to [[nuclear blackmail]] or [[nuclear terrorism]] by a so-called [[rogue state]].  The feasibility of this more limited goal remains somewhat controversial.  Under President [[Bill Clinton]] some testing continued, but the project received little funding despite Clinton's supportive remarks on 5 September 2000 that "such a system, if it worked properly, could give us an extra dimension of insurance in a world where proliferation has complicated the task of preserving peace."

The system is administered by the [[Missile Defense Agency]]. There are several other agencies and military commands which play a role, such as the [[United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command]].

===Components===
The current NMD system consists of several components.

====Ground-based interceptor missiles====
One major component is [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]] (GMD), consisting of ground-based interceptor (GBI) missiles and radar in the United States in [[Alaska]], which would intercept incoming warheads in space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaskajournal.com/stories/060509/loc_img2_001.shtml Begich, Gates visit Alaska missile defense base] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129160036/http://www.alaskajournal.com/stories/060509/loc_img2_001.shtml |date=29 November 2010 }} By Tim Bradner, Alaska Journal of Commerce  5 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS197994+30-Oct-2009+GNW20091030 Northrop Grumman Contribution to Support Missile Defense Workforce in Alaska] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104221744/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS197994+30-Oct-2009+GNW20091030 |date=4 November 2009 }}, reuters.com Fri 30 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/08/commanding-the.html|title=Commanding Alaska's Guard w/ 24/7 missile defense|work=BLACKFIVE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently some GBI missiles are located at Vandenberg AFB in California. These GBIs can be augmented by mid-course SM-3 interceptors fired from Navy ships.  About ten interceptor missiles were operational as of 2006.    In 2014, the Missile Defense Agency had 30 operational GBIs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/3979m-next-step-or-last-step-for-gmd-05229/|title=Missile Defense: Next Steps for the USA’s GMD|date=1 June 2015|work=Defense Industry Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 14 additional ground-based interceptors requested for 2017 deployment, in the Fiscal Year 2016 budget.&lt;ref&gt;United States [http://www.mda.mil/global/documents/pdf/budgetfy16.pdf Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430182858/http://www.mda.mil/global/documents/pdf/budgetfy16.pdf |date=30 April 2015 }} accessdate=2015-05-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially, the final deployment goal is the "C3" phase, intended to counter tens of complex warheads from two GMD locations utilizing 200 ABMs "or more". The system design permits further expansion and upgrades beyond the C3 level.

====Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System====
A major component is a ship-based system called the [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System]]. This was given major new importance by President Obama in September 2009, when he announced plans to scrap the plans for a [[US missile defense complex in Poland|missile defense site in Poland]], in favor of missile defense systems located on US Navy warships.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14515370 New missile defences in Europe:Shooting down a plan], Economist, 24 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/sm3.htm RIM-161 SM-3 (AEGIS Ballistic Missile Defense)], spacewar.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times article"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/world/europe/18shield.html?_r=2&amp;hp NY Times article], 9/18/09.&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2009, Russian Prime Minister Putin welcomed Obama's plans for missile defense which may include stationing American Aegis armed warships in the Black Sea.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-missile-defense19-2009sep19,0,2726164.story Russia's Putin praises Obama's missile defense decision], LA Times, 9/19/09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ricks.foreignpolicy.com"&gt;[http://ricks.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/09/17/no_missile_defense_in_eastern_europe No missile defense in Eastern Europe], foreignpolicy.com, 9/17/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, several [[US Navy]] ships were fitted with [[SM-3 missiles]] to serve this function, which complements the [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot]] systems already deployed by American units. Also, warships of [[Japan]] and [[Australia]] have been given weapons and technology to enable them to participate in the American defense plan as well.&lt;ref name="navytimes 091909"&gt;[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2009/09/military_missiledefense_obama_091709w/ Obama sharply alters missile defense plans] By William H. McMichael, 19 Sep 2009, navytimes.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Article on Sm-3 missile system"&gt;[http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htada/articles/20091004.aspx Article on SM-3 missile system], strategypage.com, 10/4/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November 2009, the Missile Defense Agency announced that six additional US Navy destroyers would be upgraded to participate in the program. In fiscal 2012, {{USS|Carney|DDG-64}}, {{USS|Ross|DDG-71}}, and {{USS|Donald Cook|DDG-75}} will be upgraded. {{USS|Cole|DDG-67}}, {{USS|McFaul|DDG-74}} and {{USS|Porter|DDG-78}} will be upgraded in fiscal 2013. The goal of the program is to have 21 ships upgraded by the end of 2010; 24 in 2012; and 27 around 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2009/11/navy_aegisbmd_111209w/ "MDA announces next 6 BMD ships"], ''[[Navy Times]]'', 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

All ships equipped with the Aegis combat system possess the [[RIM-66 Standard|SM-2]] surface-to-air missile which, through recent upgrades, has terminal stage ballistic missile defense capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mda.mil/system/aegis_bmd.html|title=MDA - Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense|work=mda.mil|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125154343/http://www.mda.mil/system/aegis_bmd.html|archivedate=25 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense====
[[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense]] (THAAD) is a program of the [[US Army]], utilizing ground-based interceptor missiles which can intercept missiles in the upper part of the atmosphere and outside the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense|url=http://www.mda.mil/system/thaad.html|publisher=Missile Defense Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731145651/http://www.mda.mil/system/thaad.html|archivedate=31 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Airborne systems====
Several airborne systems are being examined, which would then be utilized by the [[US Air Force]]. One major object of study is a boost-phase defense, meaning a system to intercept missiles while they are in their boost phase. One potential system for this use might be an airborne laser, being tested on the [[Boeing YAL-1]] which was later cancelled. Other ideas are also being studied.&lt;ref name="Goure"&gt;[http://www.spacewar.com/reports/BMD_Strategies_Multilayered_Ballistic_Missile_Defense_Systems_Part_2_and_3_999.html BMD Strategies: Multilayered Ballistic Missile Defense Systems Part 2 and 3], by [[Daniel Goure]], Arlington, Va., spacewar.com, 21 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, the only anti-ballistic missile defense system with a boost-phase capability is the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. There are several benefits to a sea-based boost-phase system, as it is fully mobile and has greater security by operating in international waters.&lt;ref name="Goure"/&gt;

====Shorter-range anti-ballistic missiles====
Three shorter range tactical [[anti-ballistic missile]] systems are currently operational: the U.S. Army [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot]], U.S. Navy [[Aegis combat system]]/[[RIM-156 Standard#RIM-67 and RIM-156 SM-2 Extended Range|SM-2 missile]], and the Israeli [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow missile]]. In general short-range tactical ABMs cannot intercept ICBMs, even if within range ([[Arrow-3]] can intercept ICBMs).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Defending_from_Outer_Space_Israel_Introduces_Arrow_3_Missile_Interceptor_System_999.html&lt;/ref&gt; The tactical ABM radar and performance characteristics do not allow it, as an incoming ICBM warhead moves much faster than a tactical missile warhead. However, the better-performance Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile could be upgraded to intercept ICBMs. The SM-3 missile may have some capability against ICBMs, as demonstrated by the [[RIM-161 Standard missile SM-3#Anti-satellite|2008 satellite shootdown]].

Latest versions of the U.S. [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk missile]] have a limited capability against tactical ballistic missiles, but is not usually described as an ABM. Similar claims have been made about the Russian long-range surface-to-air [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]] and [[S-400]] series.

====Multilateral and international participation====
Several aspects of the defense program have either sought or achieved participation and assistance from other nations. Several foreign navies are participating in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense, including Japan and Australia. Also, the United States has considered establishing radar sites and missile sites in other nations as part of the [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]]. A [[US missile defense complex in Poland|missile defense site in Poland]] received much media attention when it was cancelled in favor of the Aegis BMD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6720153.stm Q&amp;A: US missile defence], BBC, 9/20/09.&lt;/ref&gt; A radar site in the United Kingdom is being upgraded, and another one is being built in Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mda.mil/global/documents/pdf/uewr1.pdf Upgraded Early Warning Radars (UEWR)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912144237/http://www.mda.mil/global/documents/pdf/uewr1.pdf |date=12 September 2014 }}, Official briefing document, Missile Defense Agency website, 9/20/09.&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries have contributed technological developments and various locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mda.mil/system/international_cooperation.html International Cooperation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201031525/http://mda.mil/system/international_cooperation.html |date=1 February 2016 }}, official briefing document, Missile Defense Agency website, 9/20/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republic of China – United States relations|Taiwan]] has indicated that it is willing to host national missile defense radars to be tied into the American system, but is unwilling to pay for any further cost overruns in the systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/taiwan/2011/taiwan-110614-cna01.htm "Taiwan rejects further advanced radar system price hikes."] ''CNA'', 14 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wall Street Journal reported on 17 July 2012, that the Pentagon is building a missile-defense radar station at a secret site in Qatar.&lt;ref name="WSJ20120717"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pentagon Bulks Up Defenses in the Gulf|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304388004577531331722511516 |accessdate=17 September 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=17 July 2012|author=Adam Enteus and Julian E.

The radar base in Qatar is slated to house a powerful AN/TPY-2 radar, also known as an X-Band radar, and supplement two similar arrays already in place in Israel's Negev Desert and in central Turkey, officials said. Together, the three radar sites form an arc that U.S. officials say can detect missile launches from northern, western and southern Iran. Those sites will enable U.S. officials and allied militaries to track missiles launched from deep inside Iran, which has an arsenal of missiles capable of reaching Israel and parts of Europe. The radar installations, in turn, are being linked to missile-interceptor batteries throughout the region and to U.S. ships with high-altitude interceptor rockets. The X-Band radar provides images that can be used to pinpoint rockets in flight.&lt;ref name="WSJ20120717" /&gt;

U.S. official also stated that the U.S. military's Central Command, which is overseeing the buildup to counter Iran, also wants to deploy the Army's first Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile-interceptor system, known as a THAAD, to the region in the coming months.
The THAAD has its own radar, so deploying it separately from the X-Bands provides even more coverage and increases the system's accuracy, officials said. The X-Band radar and the THAAD will provide an "extra layer of defense," supplementing Patriot batteries that are used to counter lower-altitude rockets, said Riki Ellison, chairman of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance.&lt;ref name="WSJ20120717" /&gt;

On 23 August 2012, the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. is planning a major expansion of missile defenses in Asia. According to American officials this move is designed to contain threats from North Korea, but one that could also be used to counter China's military. The planned buildup is part of a defensive array that could cover large swaths of Asia, with a new radar in southern Japan and possibly another in Southeast Asia tied to missile-defense ships and land-based interceptors.&lt;ref name="WSW20120823"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Plans New Asia Missile Defenses|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444812704577605591629039400 |accessdate=23 August 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=23 August 2012|author=Adam Entous and Julian E. Barnes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US Defence officials told the Wall Street Journal that the core of the new anti-missile shield would be a powerful early-warning radar, known as an X-Band, sited on a southern Japanese island. Discussions between Japan and the United States are currently underway.
The new X-Band would join an existing radar that was installed in northern Japan in 2006 and a third X-Band could be placed in South East Asia. The resulting radar arc would cover North Korea, China and possibly even Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|title=Pentagon plans new missile defences in Asia|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9493917/Pentagon-plans-new-missile-defences-in-Asia.html|accessdate=23 August 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 August 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to U.S. Navy officials and the Congressional Research Service the U.S. Navy has drawn up plans to expand its [[Aegis Combat System|fleet of ballistic missile-defense-capable warships]] from 26 ships today to 36 by 2018. Officials said as many as 60% of those are likely to be deployed to Asia and the Pacific.&lt;ref name="WSW20120823" /&gt; In addition, the U.S. Army is considering acquiring additional [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense]], or THAAD, antimissile systems, said a senior defense official. Under current plans, the Army is building six THAADs.&lt;ref name="WSW20120823" /&gt;

In response to the Wall Street Journal U.S. General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on 23 August 2012  that the United States are in discussions with its close ally Japan about expanding a missile defense system in Asia by positioning an early warning radar in southern Japan. Dempsey however stated that no decisions have been reached on expanding the radar.&lt;ref name="APWP20120824"&gt;{{cite news|title=US discussing more missile defense in Asia, says it’s against NKorea threat, not China|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-discussing-more-missile-defense-in-asia-says-its-against-nkorea-threat-not-china/2012/08/23/38d38280-ed93-11e1-866f-60a00f604425_story.html?wp_login_redirect=0|work=Associated Press|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=24 August 2012|date=24 August 2012}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department said the U.S. is taking a phased approach to missile defense in Asia, as it is in Europe and the Middle East.

"In the case of Asian systems, they are designed against a missile threat from North Korea.

On 14 October 2002, a ground based interceptor launched from the [[Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site]] destroyed a mock warhead 225&amp;nbsp;km above the Pacific.  The test included three decoy balloons.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Defense. [http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2002/b10142002_bt520-02.html MISSILE INTERCEPT TEST SUCCESSFUL]. 14 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 2002 President [[George W. Bush]] signed [[National Security Directive|National Security Presidential Directive]] 23&lt;ref&gt;[[Federation of American Scientists]]. [https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/nspd-23.htm National Security Presidential Directive 23]. 16 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; which outlined a plan to begin deployment of  operational ballistic missile defense systems by 2004. The following day the U.S. formally requested from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Denmark]] use of facilities in [[RAF Fylingdales|Fylingdales]], [[England]], and [[Thule, Greenland|Thule]], [[Greenland]], respectively, as a part of the NMD program. The projected cost of the program for the years 2004 to 2009 will be $53 billion, making it the largest single line in [[The Pentagon]]'s budget.

Since 2002, the US has been in talks with [[Poland]] and other European countries over the possibility of setting up a European base to intercept long-range missiles. A site similar to the US base in Alaska would help protect the US and Europe from missiles fired from the Middle East or North Africa. Poland's prime minister [[Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz]] said in November 2005 he wanted to open up the public debate on whether Poland should host such a base.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4445284.stm US considers Polish missile base]. 17 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, NMD was changed to [[Ground-Based Missile Defense|Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]] (GMD), to differentiate it from other missile defense programs, such as space-based, sea-based, and defense targeting the boost phase and the reentry phase (see [[Intercontinental ballistic missile#Flight phases|flight phases]]).

On 22 July 2004, the first ground-based interceptor was deployed at [[Fort Greely]], [[Alaska]] ({{coord|63.954|N|145.735|W|region:US-AK_type:landmark_scale:5000_source:wikimapia}}). By the end of 2004, a total of six had been deployed at Ft. Greely and another two at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], California. Two additional were installed at Ft. Greely in 2005. The system will provide "rudimentary" protection.

On 15 December 2004, an interceptor test in the [[Marshall Islands]] failed when the launch was aborted due to an "unknown anomaly" in the interceptor, 16 minutes after launch of the target from [[Kodiak Island]], [[Alaska]].

"I don't think that the goal was ever that we would declare it was operational. I think the goal was that there would be an operational capability by the end of 2004," Pentagon representative Larry DiRita said on 2005-01-13 at a Pentagon press conference. However, the problem is and was funding. "There has been some expectation that there will be some point at which it is operational and not something else these expectations are not unknown, if Congress pours more attention and funding to this system, it can be operational relatively quick."

On 18 January 2005, the Commander, [[United States Strategic Command]] issued direction to establish the [[Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated Missile Defense]] (JFCC IMD).  The JFCC IMD, once activated, will develop desired characteristics and capabilities for global missile defense operations and support for missile defense.

On 14 February 2005, another interceptor test failed due to a malfunction with the ground support equipment at the test range on [[Kwajalein|Kwajalein Island]], not with the interceptor missile itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Missile Defense Agency]].

On 24 February 2005, the [[Missile Defense Agency]], testing the [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System]], successfully intercepted a mock enemy missile.  This was the first test of an operationally configured [[RIM-161 Standard missile 3]] (SM-3) interceptor and the fifth successful test intercept using this system.  On 10 November 2005, the [[USS Lake Erie (CG-70)|USS ''Lake Erie'']] detected, tracked, and destroyed a mock two-stage ballistic missile within two minutes of the ballistic missile launch.&lt;ref&gt;[[Missile Defense Agency]].[http://www.mda.mil/mdalink/pdf/05news0008.pdf Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Flight Test Successful] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713115954/http://www.mda.mil/mdalink/pdf/05news0008.pdf |date=13 July 2009 }}. (PDF). 24 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2006, the [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System]] was successfully tested.  An interceptor was launched from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] to hit a target missile launched from [[Alaska]], with ground support provided by a crew at [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]].  This test was described by Missile Defense Agency director Lieutenant General Trey Obering as "about as close as we can come to an end-to-end test of our long-range missile defense system."&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Defense.

Follow the 'BMDS Programs' link to the 'Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD)' pages in the report&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 2000 study by the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] and the Security Studies Program at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] concluded that "[a]ny country capable of deploying a long-range missile would also be able to deploy countermeasures that would defeat the planned NMD system."
Countermeasures studied in detail were bomblets containing biological or chemical agents, aluminized balloons to serve as decoys and to disguise warheads, and cooling warheads to reduce the kill vehicle’s ability to detect them.&lt;ref&gt;Union of Concerned Scientists/MIT Security Studies Program.

In April 2004, a [[General Accounting Office]] report concluded that "MDA does not explain some critical assumptions—such as an enemy’s type and number of decoys—underlying its performance goals."   It recommended that "DOD carry out independent, operationally realistic testing of each block being fielded" but DOD responded that "formal operational testing is not required before entry into full-rate production."&lt;ref&gt;General Accounting Office report GAO-04-409 [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04409.pdf ''Missile Defense: Actions are Needed to Enhance Testing and Accountability''](PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents did not suggest how to discriminate between empty and warhead-enclosing balloons, for instance, but said that these "simple" countermeasures are actually hard to implement, and that defense technology is rapidly advancing to defeat them.&lt;ref&gt;''Countermeasure Doubletalk / UCS Overstates Ease of Defeating Missile Defense'' Scott McMahon, Stanley Orman, and Richard Speier, Defense News, 19 June 2000  p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) said decoy discrimination techniques were classified, and emphasized its intention to provide future boost and terminal defense to diminish the importance of midcourse decoys.&lt;ref&gt;Missile Defense Agency [http://www.mda.mil/mdaLink/html/kadish8sep00.html ''Statement of Lieutenant General Ronald T. Kadish, USAF Director, Ballistic Missile Defense Organization Before the House Subcommittee on National Security, Veterans Affairs, and International Relations Committee on Government Reform, September 8, 2000'' "NMD Counter Countermeasures" section] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713115752/http://www.mda.mil/mdaLink/html/kadish8sep00.html |date=13 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In summer 2002 MDA ceased providing detailed intercept information and declined to answer technical questions about decoys on grounds of national security.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Defense Information [http://www.cdi.org/weekly/2002/issue36.html ''IFT-9: A Questionable Success For Missile Defense''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406091520/http://www.cdi.org/weekly/2002/issue36.html |date=6 April 2012 }}.

China is developing  a [[hypersonic glide vehicle]] (HGV), now called the DF-ZF,&lt;ref name="4Sep2015"&gt;[http://freebeacon.com/national-security/china-shows-new-intermediate-range-missile-capable-of-targeting-ships/ China Shows New intermediate-Range Missile Capable of Targeting Ships] - freebeacon.com, 4 September 2015

The US Department of Defense  denotes this HGV as the [[WU-14]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freebeacon.com/china-conducts-first-test-of-new-ultra-high-speed-missile-vehicle/ "China Conducts First Test of New Ultra-High Speed Missile Vehicle"]. ''Washington Free Beacon''. 2014-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boost-phase defense==
As of boost-phase interceptions, these would be desired as an initial layer of defense. It is the only layer that can cost-effectively destroy MIRV missiles.

Currently only Aegis has a possible boost-phase capability, but—in the case of the SM-2—it needs to be within 40&amp;nbsp;km of a launch point.&lt;ref name=APSboost&gt;[[American Physical Society]], [https://archive.is/20130224092112/http://rmp.aps.org/pdf/RMP/v76/i3/pS1_1 ''Report of the American Physical Society Study Group on Boost-Phase Intercept System for National Missile Defense: Scientific and Technical Issues, Rev. Mod. Phys. 76, S1 2004]. David K. Barton, Roger Falcone, Daniel Kleppner, Frederick K. Lamb, Ming K. Lau, Harvey L. Lynch, David Moncton, David Montague, David E. Mosher, William Priedhorsky, Maury Tigner, and David R. Vaughan.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is acceptable for [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs), but not likely for land-based [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs).

===Boost-phase defense against solid-fueled ICBMs===
Boost-phase defense is significantly harder against the current [[solid-fuel rocket]] ICBMs, because their boost phase is shorter. Current solid-fueled ICBMs include Russian [[RT-2UTTKh Topol M|Topol]], and Chinese [[DF-31]] and [[DF-41]], along with the US [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman]] and [[Trident (missile)|Trident]].

There is no theoretical perspective for economically viable boost-phase defense against the latest solid-fueled ICBMs, no matter if it would be ground-based missiles, space-based missiles, or [[airborne laser]] (ABL).&lt;ref name=APSboost /&gt;

===Boost-phase defense against older ICBMs===
A ground-based boost-phase defense might be possible, if the goals were somewhat limited: to counter older liquid-fuel propelled ICBMs, and to counter simple solid-propellant missiles launched from "easier" locations (such as [[North Korea]]).

Using orbital launchers to provide a reliable boost-phase defense against liquid-fueled ICBMs is not likely, as it was found to require at least 700 large interceptors in orbit. Using two or more interceptors per target, or countering solid fueled missiles, would require many more orbital launchers. The old [[Brilliant Pebbles]] project—although it did not apply to the boost phase—estimated the number at 4,000 smaller orbital launchers.

The [[airborne laser]] (ABL) is possibly capable of intercepting a liquid fuel missile if within 600&amp;nbsp;km from a launch point.&lt;ref&gt;Physics Today published by the [[American Physical Society]].

The '''''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs''''' (also known as ''The Washington Report'' and WRMEA)  magazine, published eight times per year, focuses on "news and analysis from and about the Middle East and U.S. policy in that region".&lt;ref name=AboutWRMEA&gt;[http://www.wrmea.org/about-wrmea.html "About Washington Report on Middle East Affairs"].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' has characterized it as "critical of United States policies in the Middle East".&lt;ref name="AIPAC-SC"&gt;Linda Greenhouse, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/15/us/justices-hear-arguments-in-suit-against-election-agency.html "Justices Hear Arguments in Suit Against Election Agency"],'' [[New York Times]]'', January 15, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''[[USA Today]]'' called it "a non-partisan publication that has been critical of Bush's policies".&lt;ref&gt;Judy Keen, [https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-10-16-libby_x.htm 'Scooter' packs lot of power but runs quietly], ''[[USA Today]]'', October 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of pro-Israel organizations have criticized the ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'' as being aligned with the [[Arab lobby]] and as "[[Criticism of Israel|anti-Israel]]".

==Organization==
The ''Washington Report'' is published by the [[American Educational Trust]] (AET), founded in 1982 as a [[non-profit foundation]] incorporated in Washington, D.C. under [[501(c)#501(c)(4)|501(c)4]] by retired U.S. foreign service officers including  [[Andrew Killgore]], who was U.S. Ambassador to [[Qatar]] when he retired from the [[United States Foreign Service]] in 1980 and [[Richard Curtiss]], a former head of the Arabic Service of the [[Voice of America]], who was chief inspector of the U.S. Information Agency when he retired from the [[United States Foreign Service]] in 1980. Killgore is the publisher and Curtiss was the Executive Editor until his death in 2013. Delinda C. Hanley, Curtiss's daughter, is the current editor.&lt;ref name=AboutWRMEA/&gt;

AET's [[Foreign Policy]] Committee has included former U.S. ambassadors, [[government official]]s, and members of the [[United States Congress]], including the late [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[J. William Fulbright]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Charles H. Percy|Charles Percy]], both former chairmen of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]]. Members of its board of directors and advisory committees "receive no fees for their services".&lt;ref name=AboutWRMEA/&gt;

The ''Washington Report'' began in 1982 as a [[bi-weekly]] eight-page newsletter and today is a 76-page full-color magazine. It is recognized worldwide as a leader in its field, publishing a wide variety of views from and about the Middle East by Muslim, Jewish and Christian writers, many of whom live or have lived in the region. The magazine's "nonprofit wing has donated 3,200 free subscriptions" and dozens of books to libraries.&lt;ref name="ballon"&gt;Marc Ballon, [http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=15287 Libraries: The New Mideast Battlefront], ''[[Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'', January 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
{{Primary sources|section|date=October 2014}}
The ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'' states its position as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'' does not take partisan domestic political positions. As a solution to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], it endorses [[U.N. Security Council Resolution 242]]'s land-for-peace formula, supported by seven successive U.S. presidents. In general, the ''Washington Report'' supports Middle East solutions which it judges to be consistent with the charter of the United Nations and traditional American support for human rights, self-determination and fair play.&lt;ref name=AboutWRMEA/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Washington Report'' carries articles with perspectives ranging from the Israeli [[Left-wing politics|left]] (e.g., [[Uri Avnery]], [[Ilan Pappe]]), to [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] (e.g., [[Sheldon Richman]] and [[Leon Hadar]]), to the isolationist U.S. [[Right-wing politics|right]] (e.g., [[Robert Novak]], [[Pat Buchanan]]). As long ago as 1990, the publication argued that criticism of Israel (generally defined as [[Anti-Zionism]]) should not be equated with [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Curtiss, [http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0590/9005009.htm "Who Suffers When Criticism of Israel Is Equated With Anti-Semitism?"], ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'', May 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine often publishes articles and letters (both to itself and outside publications) that seek a [[one-state solution]] to replace Israel with a state comprising both Israel and the Palestinian territories that would have a large Muslim majority population, and also offers uncritical platforms for the mostly one-state movement of [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, during the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], the ''Washington Report'' wrote about the future of Soviet Jews and stated that most Jews wanted to emigrate to either Europe or the United States rather than Israel and that the arrival of large numbers of emigrants into Israel would harm the economy or lead to an influx of Soviet Jews into the West Bank and Gaza Strip.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The ''Washington Report'' publishes listings of pro-Israel [[political action committee]] contributions to congressional candidates for each Congress, as well as elected representatives' voting records during each Congress. It also publishes a sum total of direct aid to Israel, which it estimates at almost $114 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrmea.org/congress-a-us-aid-to-israel.html Congress &amp; U.S. Aid to Israel], ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs''.&lt;/ref&gt; This resource has been quoted by a number of publications over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0512/p15s01-wmgn.html?view=print|title=Why the presidential candidates won't talk about Israel|author=|date=12 May 2008|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=17760|title=Inter Press Service - News and Views from the Global South|author=|date=|website=www.ipsnews.net|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/akers/akers108.html|title=The Evil Jane Harman (D-?) - LewRockwell LewRockwell.com|author=|date=|website=lewrockwell.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/KC06Ak01.html|title=Asia Times Online :: Middle East News, Iraq, Iran current affairs|first=Asia Time|last=Online|date=|website=www.atimes.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gulfnews.com/opinion/columns/world/10248220.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Washington Report'' has published dozens of articles about the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] (AIPAC).{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In 1989, founders Andrew Killgore and Richard Curtiss joined other plaintiffs in complaining that the Federal Election Commission had improperly refused to label AIPAC a "political action committee" (PAC) and require AIPAC to disclose the sources and uses of money. The case went to the [[United States Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="AIPAC-SC"/&gt; The Supreme Court ruled in a majority decision that the plaintiffs had the right to raise issues regarding AIPAC, but referred the PAC matter back to the FEC because the FEC was drafting its membership threshold rules to directly address the unclear issue. The FEC decided that AIPAC did not spend an amount of time or money on political issues to make it a PAC, and in 2010 the last of ''WRMEA''{{'}}s appeals to have the FEC ruling reversed was dismissed.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The ''Washington Report'' has published a number of articles on Israel's 1967 [[USS Liberty incident|attack on USS ''Liberty'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussliberty.org/wrmeaarchive.htm Twenty Years of USS Liberty Reporting in The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs] at the USS ''Liberty'' web site.&lt;/ref&gt; James Ennes, a retired Naval lieutenant commander who was on USS ''Liberty'' the day of the attack, wrote two articles detailing evidence that the attack was deliberate.&lt;ref&gt;James Ennes, Jr. articles in the ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'' include: [http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0693/9306019.htm "The Assault on the USS ''Liberty'' Still Covered Up After 26 Years"], June 1993, p. 19; [http://www.wrmea.com/archives/May-June_2005/0505030.html USS Liberty: 38 Years and Counting], May/June 2005, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also has published articles on the topic by former representative [[Paul Findley]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Findley, [http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0398/9803026.html Even as "USS ''Liberty''{{'}}s Heroic Captain Receives New Honor, Coverup of Israeli Attack on His Ship Continues"], ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'', March 1998, p. 26, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; former US Ambassador to [[Saudi Arabia]] [[James E. Akins]]&lt;ref&gt;James E. Akins, "The Israeli Attack on the USS Liberty, June 8, 1967", ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'', December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] analyst [[Ray McGovern]]&lt;ref&gt;Ray McGovern, [http://wrmea.com/archives/December_2008/0812067.html "Ray McGovern on the USS ''Liberty''"], ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'', December 2008, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the magazine reported that the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[General Accounting Office]] had both noted Israeli thefts of U.S. military technology secrets, confirming that Israel had transferred  technology from the largely U.S. taxpayer funded [[IAI Lavi|Lavi fighter]]  program to China.&lt;ref&gt;Shawn L. Twing, [http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0496/9604014.htm "Pentagon, GAO Report Israeli Espionage And Illegal Technology Retransfer"], ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'', April 1996, pp. 14, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of several publications that pointed out in 2007 that China's [[Chengdu J-10]] fighter bore a striking similarity to the Lavi.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Swibel, [https://www.forbes.com/2007/10/31/beltway-sanctions-international-biz-wash-cz_ms_1031beltway.html Are Fighter Jets The Latest Lethal Chinese Export?], ''[[Forbes]]'', October 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Gee,[http://www.wrmea.com/archives/April_2007/0704042.html Has Israel's U.S.-Funded Lavi Jet Been Reborn as China’s J-10 Warplane?], ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'', April 2007, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the magazine reported on the case of Mohammed Salah, the first American citizen to be placed on the U.S. government list of terrorists after being arrested and imprisoned for five years by Israel, charged with being a member of [[Hamas]]. When he returned home, the U.S. seized his assets.&lt;ref&gt;Raeed N. Tayeh, [http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0798/9807118.html "U.S. Government Moves to Seize Chicago Home of Mohammad Salah After His Conviction in Israel"], ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'', July/August 1998, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Curtiss wrote about the Secret Evidence Repeal Act of 1999, which was motivated in part by the government's use of "secret evidence" to justify seizing Salah's assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0999/9909016.html "House Bill to Repeal Use of Secret Evidence Gets 19 Sponsors as National Awareness of Abuses Grows"], ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'', September 1999, pp. 16, 120, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 Curtiss wrote that Salah alleged he was tortured with beatings by interrogators, including an American-born Israeli, and that evidence was being used by U.S. prosecutors. Curtiss also quoted Salah's comments on his attorney's urging him to help "put Israel on trial".&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Curtis, [http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/1299/9912035.html "In Case You Thought It Can't Happen Here: Mohammad Salah, an American Citizen, Is Facing Trial on Charges Neither He Nor His Lawyer Can See"], ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'', December 1999, pp. 35, 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting this, Jeff Breinholt, then Deputy Chief, Counterterrorism Section, [[United States Department of Justice]], criticized Salah's attorneys for pressuring him to use the torture defense, calling it "lawfare". He also defended the judge's decision to allow Israeli interrogators to testify in closed court.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Beinholt, [http://writ.news.findlaw.com/commentary/20070309_breinholt.html "Is Lawfare Being Abused by American Lawyers?"], [[Findlaw]], March 09, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Salah was acquitted of financing Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1227494541.html "Salah's acquittal"], ''[[Chicago Jewish Star]]'', February 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the publication wrote that the United States government in that year provided the [[U.S. Holocaust Museum]] $38.4 million, or 67 percent of its annual budget, more than it provided to the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]. It opined that "Americans well might wonder why" when the [[National World War II Memorial]], the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] and the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] were not yet completed, "the U.S. government places a higher priority on a museum dedicated to the victims and survivors of a European horror".&lt;ref&gt;Janet McMahon, [http://www.wrmea.com/archives/December_2003/0312009.html "The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum: A Decade of Increasing Taxpayer Funding"], ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'', December 2003, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, AET's Andrew Killgore spearheaded a letter to President George W. Bush signed by a number of former American diplomats objecting to US policy towards Israel and the Palestinians, especially then Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]]'s [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|plan to leave Gaza]] without bothering to negotiate with Palestinian representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2004-05/a-2004-05-04-2-1.cfm?moddate=2004-05-04 Former US Diplomats Criticize Bush Mideast Policy], [[Voice of America]], May 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Reynold, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3682825.stm "Why Bush is likely to ignore letter"], [[BBC]], May 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Fox News]] quoted Andrew Killgore on the prosecution of two AIPAC employees in the [[Lawrence Franklin espionage scandal]]. Killgore said that although AIPAC was not a [[Foreign Agents Registration Act|registered foreign agent under the law]], it was in fact a foreign agent and that the U.S. government should assume intelligence shared with allies "all over the world".&lt;ref&gt;Kelley Beaucar Vlaho, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,280172,00.html "AIPAC 'Spy' Trial Delayed Again"], [[Fox News]], June 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He has written at length on the topic in the ''Washington Report''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Killgore, [http://www.wrmea.org/component/content/article/246-2008-september-october/5373-israeli-spying-on-the-united-states.html "Israeli Spying on the United States"], ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'', September–October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ''WRMEA'' also tied the case into their ''Akins v. FEC'' lawsuit, saying it was another reason AIPAC should be declared a foreign PAC, but the efforts died when the FBI withdrew the prosecutions stemming from the Franklin case.

In 2008, a number of publications reported that [[Mohammed Omer]], the Gaza correspondent for the ''Washington Report'', was hospitalized after Israeli soldiers cracked his ribs and inflicted other injuries at a crossing from Jordan into the occupied [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrmea.com/action_alerts/070208_personal.html "''Washington Report'' Correspondent Mohammed Omer Hospitalized Following Detention by Israeli Soldiers at Allenby Bridge  Crossing"], ''The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'', July 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-07-10-Gazajournalist_N.htm Gaza journalist claims held at gunpoint; Israel denies], ''[[USA Today]]'', July 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Levy, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/999330.html 'Why did they treat me like that?'], ''[[Haaretz]]'', July 10, 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221125856/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/999330.html |date=February 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli government disputed Omer's claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jul10/0,4670,IsraelGazaJournalist,00.html "Gaza reporter alleges was mistreated by Israel"] By Karin Laub, Associated Press. Fox News, July 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 1992, then AIPAC Deputy Director of Research and Information Michael Lewis charged that "Arabists" have become a major problem for Israel in the United States, distributing copies of the ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'' to an audience as evidence. He also wrote up his critique in AIPAC's ''Near East Report''. The ''Washington Report'' printed a rebuttal of Lewis' accusations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0792/92070088.html AIPAC IN ACTION: An Attack on the Washington Report], ''Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'', July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Michael Lewis accused the ''Washington Report'' of promoting [[conspiracy theories]] (especially regarding the [[USS Liberty incident|USS ''Liberty'' incident]]) and publishing reports that accuse Israel and [[Zionists]] of being collectively responsible for many issues in the United States and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lewis, [http://www.meforum.org/372/israels-american-detractors-back-again Israel's American Detractors – Back Again], ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'', November 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis is now AIPAC's Director of Policy Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aipac.org/about_AIPAC/Learn_About_AIPAC/23297.asp AIPAC Policy Conference program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614155543/http://www.aipac.org/about_AIPAC/Learn_About_AIPAC/23297.asp |date=June 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Jonathan S. Tobin]] wrote in ''[[Jewish World Review]]'' that the publication was "the guidebook to the Arabist lobby in the United States," that it "specializes in defaming Israel",  and that it is "a must-read for friends of Israel who want a reliable indicator of the thinking of the anti-Israel crowd."&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, Jonathan. [http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/tobin091500.asp "The Friends of our Foes"], ''[[Jewish World Review]]'', Sept. 15, 2000. Retrieved Dec 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In a book published in 2002 [[Rafael Medoff]], founding director of the [[David Wyman]] Institute for Holocaust Studies, wrote that "in addition to the standard denunciations of Israeli policies, the ''Washington Report'' has published articles belittling the magnitude of [[the Holocaust]], listing the names of Jewish publishers of leading U.S. newspapers to demonstrate 'Zionist' control of the media, and accusing Israel of '[[Nazi]]-style' [[genocide]] against the Arabs. Each issue is filled with wild conspiracy theories about Israel and pro-Israel lobbying groups, accusing them of orchestrating everything from the [[Monica Lewinsky]] scandal to the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Medoff, Rafael, Jewish Americans and Political Participation, ABC-CLIO, Santa Barbara, CA 2002, page 246&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]] criticized the publication for hosting an essay by [[Paul Craig Roberts]] in which he writes the "fanatical [[neoconservatives]] and Israelis are using [[George W. Bush|Bush]] to commit the United States to a catastrophic course."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/NR/exeres/3F24AF09-83AB-455B-8A7C-FC0275CA00B3,DB7611A2-02CD-43AF-8147-649E26813571,frameless.htm Syndicated Columnist Paul Craig Roberts Promotes Anti-Semitism], [[Anti-Defamation League]] web site.&lt;/ref&gt; The pro-Israel media watchdog&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2007/10/26/archive/media-watchdog-takes-aim-at-israels-jewish-defamers Media Watchdog Takes Aim at 'Israel's Jewish Defamers'], [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] (JTA), October 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America]] ("CAMERA") describes The Washington Report as being "virulently anti-Israel".&lt;ref&gt;[[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America]], [http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&amp;x_outlet=64 Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]. Retrieved Dec 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jewish Virtual Library]] (a member of the [[Israel on Campus Coalition]]) says of the ''Washington Report'' that it "publishes many articles that are considered to be anti-Israel and anti-Zionist" and "supports the false accusation that there was a coverup regarding" the USS ''Liberty'' incident.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/kerryrecord.html Legislative Record of Senator John Kerry].&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, [[Fox News]] reported that the ''Washington Report'' had deleted from a 2007 article a comment by [[Rashad Hussain]], the newly appointed U.S. envoy to the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC), calling the prosecution of [[Sami Al-Arian]] a "politically motivated persecution". Editor Delinda Hanley told Fox News she believed the change was made in February 2009, because the comments attributed to Hussain were actually made by Sami al-Arian's daughter, Laila, who also attended the event. But article's author, Shereen Kandil, told Fox News that she had not confused the two people. The [[White House]] also attributed the comments to Al-Arian's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 22, 2010 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/02/16/obamas-islamic-envoy-disputes-report-quoting-defending-terror-convict/|title=Obama's Islamic Envoy Quoted Defending Man Charged With Aiding Terrorists|date=February 16, 2010|last=Bream|first=Shannon|publisher=[[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 23, 2010 |url=http://globalmbreport.org/?p=2173|title=EXCLUSIVE: New Obama Envoy Has History Of Engagement With U.S. Muslim Brotherhood; Called Al-Arian Case "Politically Motivated Persecution"|date=February 14, 2010|publisher=Globalmbreport.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 2006, Al-Arian had entered a guilty plea to a charge of conspiracy to help people associated with the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]].)&lt;ref name="Laughlin-plea"&gt;MegLaughlin, [http://www.sptimes.com/2006/04/23/Hillsborough/In_his_plea_deal__wha.shtml  In his plea deal, what did Sami Al-Arian admit to?], ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', April 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Hussain himself said he had made the remarks in response to a question from Laila Al-Arian, but had complained to the ''Washington Report'' shortly after they were published that they "lacked context", and the publication eventually removed the remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 22, 2010 |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0210/33210.html|title= Islam envoy retreats on terror talk |date=February 19, 2010|last=Gerstein|first=Josh|work=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
