===Preliminary tournaments===
A total of 128 [[Professional shogi players|shogi professionals]] competed in 18 preliminary tournaments to qualify for the main tournament. These tournaments were untelevised one-day tournaments held at the [[Japan Shogi Association#Headquarters and other offices|Tokyo Shogi Kaikan]] and [[Japan Shogi Association#Headquarters and other offices|Kansai Shogi Kaikan]]. Each tournament consisted of seven or eight players. The initial time control for each player was 20 minutes followed by a 30-second [[byo-yomi|''byōyomi'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shogi.or.jp/kisen/nhk/64/yosen.html|title=Dai Rokujūkai NHK Haisen Yosen|script-title=ja:第64回NHK杯戦予選|trans-title=64th NHK Cup preliminaries|language=ja|year=2014|publisher=[[Japan Shogi Association]]|access-date=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The female professional seed was determined by a single-game playoff between [[Tomomi Kai]] 2-crown (Women's ōi and Kurashiki Tōka) and [[Manao Kagawa]] (Women's ōshō), which was won by Kagawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgi2.nhk.or.jp/goshogi/kifu/sgs.cgi?d=20140316|title=Dai Rokujūkai NHK Hai Shutsujō Joryūkishi Ketteisen|script-title=ja:2014年03月16日第64回NHK杯出場女流棋士決定戦|trans-title=March 16, 2014, 64th NHK Cup Women's Professional Playoff|language=ja|publisher=NHK|access-date=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brackets from two of the preliminary tournaments are shown below.

===Main tournament===
The first time control for main tournament games was ten minutes per player. Once this was used up, a second time control of 10 one-minute periods of {{nihongo|[[time control#Japanese byo-yomi|"thinking time"]]|考慮時間|kōryō jikan}} began. Each player was given 30 seconds to make their move. If they did so, then no thinking time periods were used. If, however, they did not, a thinking time period began and they then had up to one minute (more specifically 59 seconds) to make a move before entering the next thinking time period. This process was repeated until a player had used all ten thinking time periods when the final ''byōyomi'' time control of 30 seconds per move began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgi2.nhk.or.jp/goshogi/shogitou#main_bottom|title=Taikyoku no Rūru|script-title=ja:対局のルール|trans-title=Game rules|language=Japanese|publisher=NHK|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610021348/http://cgi2.nhk.or.jp/goshogi/shogitou/#main_bottom|archive-date=June 10, 2014|access-date=December 22, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Shogi#Equipment|Sente]]'' was determined prior to each game by [[Shogi#Setup and gameplay|piece toss]].

The first game between the two lasted more than two hours before ending in [[Shogi#Winning|impasse]] after 252 moves. A second game with sente-gote reversed was then played at a time control of 5 one-minute "thinking periods" followed by a ''byōyomi'' of 30 seconds per move and Namekata won in 88 moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Dai Rokujūyonkai NHK Shōgi Terebi Tōnamento Nikaisen Dai Gokyoku|script-title=ja:第64回NHK将棋テレビトーナメント2回戦第5局|language=ja|trans-title=64th NHK TV Shogi Tournament Round 2 Game 5|airdate= September 7, 2014|last1=Shimizu|first1=Ichiyo (host)|last2=Toyoshima|first2=Masayuki (guest analyst)|network=[[NHK-E]]|series=64th NHK TV Shogi Tournament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgi2.nhk.or.jp/goshogi/kifu/sgs.cgi?d=20140907|title=Nisennen Kugatsu Nanoka Dai Rokujūkai NHK Shōgi Terebi Tōnamento Nikaisen Dai Gokyoku Jishōgi Sashinaoshikyoku|script-title=ja:2014年09月07日第64回NHK杯2回戦第5局持将棋指し直し局|language=ja|trans-title=September 7, 2014, 64th NHK Cup Round 2 Game 5 Impasse Replay|publisher=NHK|access-date=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Air Jordan XII Playoffs.jpg|thumb|Air Jordan XII Playoffs]]

[[Michael Jordan]], one of the [[NBA]]'s most iconic basketball player, has his own shoe line with the brand [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. His logo is a silhouette of him jumping, also known as the  [[Jumpman (logo)|Jumpman]]. He is one of many Hall of Fame members and is recognized as one of the greatest to play the game of basketball. Many refer to this shoe as the "Flu Game" because of the statistics that Michael Jordan had. He was playing the [[Utah Jazz]] for the [[NBA]] Finals where he played in the Jordan 12 and with the flu. Since that game, this shoe has become increasingly popular, therefore [[Air Jordan]] released more colors but limiting the amount that they produce.

They were not only liked and worn by Jordan himself but also by some of his teammates, which included [[Scottie Pippen]], [[Bill Wennington]] and [[Luc Longley]]. Scottie Pippen even fell out of the MaxAir System to have his player edition of the Air Jordan 12. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Complete History of the Air Jordans I – XX8Air Jordan XII|url=http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2013/07/air-jordan-complete-history-from-i-xx8/air-jordan-xii|website=Complex|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation and Release==
The Air Jordan 12 took the Air Jordan series to a new height. It got its inspiration from two sources: [[Nisshoki]] (The Japanese flag)  and a women’s shoe-design from the 19th century. The stitching along the side of the shoe resembles sun rays which were borrowed from the Japanese Sun Rising Flag and placed on the Air Jordan 12.  Michael Jordan wanted the shoe both comfortable and durable, and didn't bother if they took something from women’s shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Complete History of the Nike Air Jordan 12 Sneaker|url=https://www.lacesout.net/resources/history-of-jordan-sneaker/jordan-12/|website=www.lacesout.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Air Jordan XII was originally released from 1996-1997, when the [[Chicago Bulls]] were trying to win another championship for the second time in a row. Five colorways were released for the shoe and they were the first Air Jordan to feature Zoom Air. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Jordan 12: The Definitive Guide to Colorways|url=https://solecollector.com/news/air-jordan-12-the-definitive-guide-to-colorways/|website=Sole Collector|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were originally released from 1996 to 1997 and was retro-ed in 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2011–2013, and 2015–2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/ray_allen/ |title=Ray Allen Stats, Bio and Game Logs |publisher=NBA.com |date=1975-07-20 |accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Price==
The Air Jordan 12 has been subject to many highly limited colorways recently such as the ''Air Jordan 12 x PSNY'' collaboration, the ''Wings'' colorway that was limited to 12,000 pairs, and the ''OVO'' collaboration. Due to limited pairs, the Jordan 12's vary in price from {{dollarsign|USD|190|lk=on}}–{{dollarsign|USD|225|lk=off}}.

The '''Cameroon national cricket team''' is the team that represents the [[Republic of Cameroon]] in [[international cricket]]. The team is organised by the [[Cameroon Cricket Association]], which gained affiliate membership of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) on 29 June 2007&lt;ref name="ICC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/177/icc-members/affiliate-members/cameroon |title=Cameroon |accessdate=15 July 2015 |work=ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became an [[ICC members|associate member]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="Assoc"/&gt; However, the national side did not make its debut until 2011, when it played in the [[2011 ICC World Cricket League Africa Region Twenty20 Division Three|2011 Africa Division Three]] tournament in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/14/14737/Other_Matches.html Other matches played by Cameroon] – CricketArchive. Retrieved 4 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full [[Twenty20 International]] (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all [[Twenty20]] matches played between Cameroon and other [[List of International Cricket Council members|ICC members]] after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/672322|title=All T20 matches between ICC members to get international status|work=[[International Cricket Council]]|date=26 April 2018|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indian Match-fixing Investigations (1997)''' summarises the events surrounding the allegations laid by [[Manoj Prabhakar]] of match fixing in a magazine. [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]] instituted a commission to examine the charges. Based on lack of evidence, the commission dismissed all allegations .

==Prabhakar's allegations==
[[Manoj Prabhakar]] made a public allegation against an unknown team member to the magazine ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'' in June 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=19970611&amp;fname=COVER+STORY&amp;sid=2 | title=Prabhakar: 'I was offered Money' | publisher=Outlook India | date=11 June 1997 | accessdate=23 March 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; BCCI instituted a one-man investigation commission headed by retired Chief Justice of India – Honorable [[Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/jun/21d.htm | title=Chandrachud committee to probe betting scam | publisher=[[Rediff]] |date=21 June 1997 | accessdate=23 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically the following games were brought to light by Manoj Prabhakar as part of his allegations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/jun/02c.htm | title=Chandrachud committee to probe betting scam | publisher=[[Rediff]] |date=2 June 1997 | accessdate=2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* India V/s Pakistan in Sharjah in 1991. Even with fading light, the team management asked Prabhakar and [[Sanjay Manjrekar]] to continue playing after the umpires offered light. Pakistan won the match in the last over and qualified for the finals of the trophy.
* India V/s Pakistan in Colombo (Singer Cup) in 1994. Manoj Prabhakar was offered Rs 2.5 million for sabotaging the match in Pakistan's favour. Manoj claims to have shouted the player out of his room. The match was washed away due to rain.
* India V/s West Indies in Kanpur in 1994. [[Nayan Mongia]] and [[Manoj Prabhakar]] scored 11 runs in 48 balls chasing [[West Indies]] total. Both the players were dropped for the subsequent match on charges of indiscipline
* India V/s Pakistan in Sharjah (Date: Unknown). Both the captains [[Aamir Sohail]] and [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] claimed winning the toss.

==Commission hearings==

BCCI wanted the commission to examine the following charges:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/ju1/01a.htm | title=Chandrachud gets his brief | publisher=[[Rediff]] |date=28 June 1997 | accessdate=2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Was there any truth in the allegations by Manoj Prabhakar true?
* Was any Indian cricketer, official, journalist or any other person involved in betting and match fixing?
* Did [[Ajit Wadekar]] tap the telephones of Indian cricketers?
* Was there any truth in the bribery and match-fixing reports?

Justice Chandrachud started his inquiry on 7 July 1997. [[Manoj Prabhakar]], [[Kapil Dev]] and ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'' magazine correspondent Krishna Prasad deposed to the judge on the first day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/jul/07bet.htm | title=Prabhakar refuses to finger player as Chandrachud begins probe into betting scandal | publisher=[[Rediff]] |date=7 July 1997 | accessdate=2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manoj Prabhakar did not reveal names or provide evidence of his charges (Match Fixing and Phone Tapping allegation on then Cricket Manager [[Ajit Wadekar]]).&lt;ref name="Chandrachudreport"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/2000/apr/20report.htm | title=Full Report – '''Chandrachud Commission''' | publisher=[[Rediff]] |date=20 April 2000 | accessdate=23 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other people who appeared in front of the commission:
* 22 July 1997: [[Ajit Wadekar]], [[Ashok Mankad]], [[Dilip Vengsarkar]] and [[Sanjay Manjrekar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/jul/22a.htm | title=Players appear in front of Chandrachud Commission | publisher=[[Rediff]] |date=22 July 1997 | accessdate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 5 September 1997: [[Sachin Tendulkar]], [[Mohammad Azharuddin]], [[Sunil Gavaskar]], [[Nayan Mongia]] and D.V.Subba Rao (Manager – West Indies Tour)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/74094.html | title=Azhar to discuss betting allegations scandal | publisher=[[Rediff]] |date=5 September 1997 | accessdate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ajay Jadeja]], [[Chandu Borde]], [[Sandeep Patil]], Sunil Dev (Manager – India Tour of South Africa), Makarand Waigankar (Journalist) and Dr. Ali Irani (Physiotherapist)
* Aniruddha Bahal (Principal Correspondent, ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]''), Lokendra Pratap Sahi (Sports Editor, [[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]), Bipin Dani (freelance journalist), SK Sham (Press Correspondent, [[Reuters]]), Pradeep Vijaykar (Assistant Editor, [[The Times of India]]), Pradeep Magazine (Sports Editor, Pioneer), H Natarajan (Sports Editor, [[The Indian Express]]) and R. Mohan ([[The Hindu]]) gave written statements to the commission

==Chandrachud Commission report==

Justice Chandrachud completed his inquiry in October 1997 and submitted the report on an undisclosed date to BCCI. When the match fixing controversy resurfaced in 2000, [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]] released the Chandrachud Report to the media. The report concluded:

* There was no plausible reason why Manoj Prabhakar had to wait 3 to 6 years to report match-fixing allegations. [[Sanjay Manjrekar|Manjrekar's]] statement contradicted Prabhakar's on the events at Sharjah in October 1991. No evidence was provided with respect to the Singer Cup incident nor was a report made to the Captain, Coach or Vice-captain. Manoj's allegation against [[Aamir Sohail]] and [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] on the toss incident was factually incorrect as there was no match when these 2 cricketers captained their countries in Sharjah. Manoj Prabhakar refused to name the attempted briber in spite of assurances from the judge himself. The judge concluded that Manoj's allegation was a result of his getting back at Mohammad Azharuddin. The judge had no hesitation in rejecting the allegations made by Manoj Prabhakar.&lt;ref name="Chandrachudreport"/&gt;
* The judge accepted [[Ajit Wadekar]]'s statement on the phone-tapping allegation and dismissed the same.&lt;ref name="Chandrachudreport"/&gt;
* All of these inferences of journalist of match-fixing were not unjustified as the Judge himself believes that large amount of betting took place on cricket in India. But the Police said that it had not been possible for their investigating teams to identify any player or players in the Indian team who lay bets on cricket.&lt;ref name="Chandrachudreport"/&gt;

==Criticism==
There was criticism in the Indian media that the commission did not examine all facts available to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/oct/20a.htm | title=Not proven! | publisher=[[Rediff]] |date=20 October 1997 | accessdate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/84505.html | title=Chandrachud report dismissed as `old hat' | publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=21 April 2000 | accessdate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific areas of concern for the media was the method of recording evidence, lack of initiative to dig into the disconnect in facts of the Aamir Sohail – Mohammad Azharuddin toss, lack of questioning and evidences against people involved in betting and match-fixing, not considering the tapes of interview by ''Outlook'' with Rashead Latif (where he named five Indian cricketers involved in match fixing and which he subsequently backed out).

The stadium was formerly known as '''Razorback Stadium''' since 1941 before being renamed in 2001 in honor of [[Donald W. Reynolds]], an American businessman and philanthropist. The [[playing field]] in the stadium is named the '''Frank Broyles Field''', honoring former Arkansas head football coach and athletic director [[Frank Broyles]].&lt;ref name="Broyles Field"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2007-11-03/arkansas-names-football-field-after-outgoing-athletic-director-frank-broyles?story-topic-NCAAF=NBA|title=Arkansas names football field after outgoing athletic director Frank Broyles|work=Associated Press|publisher=SportingNews|date=November 4, 2007|accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before 1938, the Razorbacks played in a 300-seat stadium built in 1901 on land on top of "The Hill", which is now occupied by [[Mullins Library]] and the Fine Arts Center (in the "center" of campus). The new stadium cost approximately $492,000 and was funded by the [[Works Progress Administration]], with the University of Arkansas only paying 22% of the contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chemical Engineering at the University of Arkansas: A Centennial History, 1902-2002|author=Martin, Michael S.|isbn=0-9713470-0-X|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VlXJIRMcSmAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location=Fayetteville}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Entrepreneur"&gt;{{cite news |title=Firms line up for UA stadium project.

In the home opener for the Razorbacks, the Razorbacks defeated [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma A&amp;M]] by a score of 27–7 on September 24, 1938. The following week, Arkansas dedicated the stadium to then sitting Arkansas Governor [[Carl Edward Bailey|Carl E. Bailey]] on October 3, 1938, changing the name of the stadium to Bailey Stadium. Following Governor Bailey's defeat in the 1940 gubernatorial election to [[Homer Martin Adkins]], the stadium's name was changed in 1941 to Razorback Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The University of Arkansas Razorback Band: A History, 1874-2004|year=2004|location=Fayetteville|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|author=Thompson, T.T.

===Renovation===
[[File:09-02-06-RRS-PigScreen.jpg|thumb|left|The "PigScreen", a 30 by 107 foot [[LED]] display that was installed in 2000.]]


Athletic director Frank Broyles began searching for architects for the proposed $65 million stadium expansion and renovation in 1998, believing that the renovation was needed in order for the Razorbacks to compete in the Southeastern Conference at a consistent level.&lt;ref name="Schroeder, George 2005 207"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hogs! The Story of Razorbacks Football|author=Schroeder, George|page=207|isbn=0-7432-8052-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3c5sVvB0ihQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broyles hoped for a completion date of 2000 or 2001 and narrowed the search down to three architecture firms: [[Peter Eisenman|Eisenman Architects]] of [[New York, New York|New York]], [[Heery International]] of [[Atlanta]] and [[Rosser International]] of Atlanta.&lt;ref name="Entrepreneur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Best And Worst Of 1998"/&gt; Broyles awarded the renovation contract to Heery International with local support from the Wittenberg, DeLoney and Davidson architecture firm of Fayetteville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecabin.net/stories/080599/spo_0805990026.html|title=Razorback Stadium going uptown|author=Allen, Nate|work=Log Cabin|date=August 5, 1999|accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renovation was partly funded by the [[Donald W. Reynolds]] Foundation, when the foundation donated $21 million in 1999 to help renovate the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=$10 Million Grant From Donald W. Reynolds Foundation Brings New Life to Vol Walker Hall|work=University of Arkansas Relations|date=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was then the largest [[LED]] display in a sports venue, the 30 by 107 foot screen produced by [[SmartVision]] was installed along with a new scoreboard at the northern end zone in 2000. The expansion was completed before the beginning of the [[2001 NCAA Division I-A football season|2001 football season]], increasing the permanent seating capacity to 72,000 from its previous capacity of 51,000 seats. 4,000 bleacher seats were added in the south end zone upper deck bringing capacity to just over 76,000 with the new expansion. In honor of the Reynolds Foundation's generosity, the stadium was formally renamed Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium on September 8, 2001, where Arkansas lost to [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]] by a score of 13–3.

On November 3, 2007, the date of the last Fayetteville home game of the 2007 football season, the playing field was dedicated and named in honor of outgoing athletic director Broyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273070008|title=McFadden rushes for SEC-record 323 yards as Arkansas rolls|date=November 3, 2007|accessdate=December 29, 2010|work=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major renovation to the stadium was proposed in 2011 by Athletic Director Jeff Long, unveiling the plans to enclose the north end zone. The proposed renovation is estimated at $78 million to $95 million, which would feature at least 5,000 new seats, including field-level suites and indoor and outdoor club areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/7120140/arkansas-unveils-300-million-plan-expansion-athletic-facilities|title=Arkansas unveils athletic facilities plan|date=October 18, 2011|accessdate=April 26, 2012|work=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new upgrade to the stadium for the 2012 season increased the size to 38 by 167 feet, from the previous LED screen size of 30 by 107 feet. The upgrade was contracted through [[LSI Industries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insidevandy.com/drupal/node/15269|title=Stadium Preview: Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium|author=Kuhlenschmidt, Jack|work=The Vanderbilt Hustler|publisher=InsideVandy|date=October 28, 2010|accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arkansasrazorbacks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=6100&amp;ATCLID=205429572|title=New Video Display for Razorback Stadium|work=Athletic Media Relations|publisher=ArkansasRazorbacks.com|date=May 21, 2012|accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2016–17 offseason, the Broyles Athletic Center was demolished as part of a $160 million renovation and expansion of the stadium. The expansion will add 4,800 seats and new premium seating to the north end zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium Renovation|url=http://arkansasrazorbacks.com/dwrrs/|publisher=Arkansas Razorbacks Athletics|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in ref|date=May 2018}} This expansion will boost the capacity of the stadium from 76,000 (with south end zone top bleachers) to 80,800. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}} However, since bleachers are no longer being used on the roof of the south end zone, official capacity beginning with the 2018 season, as relayed to the university's board of trustees prior to its vote to approve the expansion project, will be 76,212. The increase in capacity is fewer than 4,800 seats because some club seating on the east side was eliminated to add additional suites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donald W.

==Controversy==
{{see also|War Memorial Stadium (Arkansas)}}
Since 1948, home games were divided between two venues: Razorback Stadium and [[War Memorial Stadium (Arkansas)|War Memorial Stadium]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. Because of the stadium renovations in 1999-2000, Razorbacks athletic director Frank Broyles wanted to move all home games to Razorback Stadium to help pay off the $30 million bond. Broyles pointed out that the expanded Razorback Stadium would increase revenue to $3 million per game, compared to the $2 million per game for playing at War Memorial Stadium.&lt;ref name="Schroeder, George 2005 207"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/64153344.html|date=July 24, 2000|accessdate=December 29, 2010|title=Broyles' Power: Fierce or Fading?|work=Arkansas Business Publishing Group|publisher=Entrepreneur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Little Rock investors did not like the idea of moving all home games to Fayetteville and countered with an offer to renovate and expand War Memorial Stadium to increase revenue. Also, Little Rock investor Warren Stephens threatened to discontinue his family's support ($150,000 in annual donations with an additional $1 million in annual support from his family's company [[Stephens Inc.]]) for the program if games were pulled from Little Rock.&lt;ref name="Schroeder, George 2005 207"/&gt;

After listening to both [[Chuck Neinas]] (Broyles' consultant on the issue)  and Stephens in January 2000, the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees voted 9-1 to sign a compromised contract with the owners of War Memorial Stadium. The contract  would keep at least two Razorbacks games, with one being a conference game, in Little Rock until the end of the 2014 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hogs! The Story of Razorbacks Football|author=Schroeder, George|page=208|isbn=0-7432-8052-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3c5sVvB0ihQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the contract with War Memorial Stadium was extended through the 2016 football season by athletic director [[Jeff Long (athletic director)|Jeff Long]].

As of 2014, a new five-year contract calls for only one game to be played at War Memorial Stadium each season through 2018. In 2014 and 2018, the game will be a conference opponent. In 2015, 2016, and 2017 the game will be versus a non-conference team. 2018 will mark the 75th anniversary of the Razorbacks playing in War Memorial Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722170120/http://thecabin.net/stories/082308/spo_0823080040.shtml|title=Razorbacks sign two-year War Memorial Extension|date=August 23, 2008|accessdate=November 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, 17-year-old Jacob Golomb, the son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, started the company as a manufacturer of swimwear designed to last longer than previously available swimsuits; he guaranteed his suits would last longer than one year, and named them "Everlast".&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Feuer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/01/nyregion/everlast-to-close-plant-in-bronx-100-workers-to-lose-their-jobs.html |title=Everlast to Close Plant in Bronx; 100 Workers to Lose Their Jobs |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 1, 2003 |accessdate=2017-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Legacy&gt;{{cite news |first=Timothy |last=Williams |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/24/nyregion/24everlast.html |title=After a Boxing Giant's Departure From the Bronx, a Tiny Contender Steps Up |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=2017-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Everlast expanded into supplying a wide range of sports equipment. The company first produced boxing gear in 1917 after a young [[Jack Dempsey]] asked them to supply him with headgear that would last for more than 15 rounds.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; It subsequently sponsored [[Roberto Duran]], [[Joe Frazier]], [[Marvin Hagler]], [[Larry Holmes]], [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], and in particular [[Muhammad Ali]] and became the most recognizable boxing brand.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Van Riper |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/11/09/everlast-boxing-reyes-business-sports-everlast.html |title=Everlast Tries To Get Back In The Fight |newspaper=Forbes |date=November 9, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113083159/http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/09/everlast-boxing-reyes-business-sports-everlast.html |archivedate=November 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Golomb died in the 1950s and was succeeded as head of the company by his son Daniel,&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; who made the Everlast logo on the company's boxing gloves larger to increase visibility on television.&lt;ref name=Legacy/&gt; Ben Nadorf purchased 50% of Everlast Sports Mfg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14161">'''Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption''' ('''EPOC''', informally called '''afterburn''') is a measurably increased rate of [[oxygen]] intake following strenuous [[exercise|activity]]. In historical contexts the term "oxygen debt" was popularized to explain or perhaps attempt to quantify [[anaerobic energy]] expenditure, particularly as regards [[lactic acid]]/[[Lactic acid|lactate]] metabolism;{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} in fact, the term "oxygen debt" is still widely used to this day.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} However, direct and indirect [[calorimeter]] experiments have definitively disproven any association of lactate metabolism as causal to an elevated oxygen uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02640410410001716760 |pmid=15841591 |pages=15–9 |title=Direct and indirect calorimetry of lactate oxidation: Implications for whole-body energy expenditure |journal=Journal of Sports Sciences |volume=23 |issue=1 |year=2005 |last1=Scott |first1=Christopher |last2=Kemp |first2=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recovery, oxygen (EPOC) is used in the processes that restore the body to a [[homeostasis|resting state]] and adapt it to the [[exercise]] just performed.  These include: [[hormone]] balancing, replenishment of fuel stores, [[Cell (biology)|cell]]ular repair, [[innervation]] and [[anabolism]]. Post-exercise oxygen consumption replenishes the [[Bioenergetic systems|phosphagen system]]. New ATP is synthesized and some of this ATP donates phosphate groups to [[creatine]] until ATP and creatine levels are back to resting state levels again. Another use of EPOC is to fuel the body’s increased metabolism from the increase in body temperature which occurs during exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saladin |first=Kenneth |title=Anatomy &amp; Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function |year=2012 |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-337825-1 |page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPOC is accompanied by an elevated consumption of fuel. In response to exercise, fat stores are broken down and [[Fatty acid#Free fatty acids|free fatty acids]] (FFA) are released into the blood stream. In recovery, the direct oxidation of free fatty acids as fuel and the energy consuming re-conversion of FFAs back into fat stores both take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bahr R |title=Excess postexercise oxygen consumption--magnitude, mechanisms and practical implications |journal=Acta Physiologica Scandinavica. Supplementum |volume=605 |issue= |pages=1–70 |year=1992 |pmid=1605041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.1991.tb09205.x |pmid=1957696 |pages=105–15 |title=Effect of exercise on recovery changes in plasma levels of FFA, glycerol, glucose and catecholamines |journal=Acta Physiologica Scandinavica |volume=143 |issue=1 |year=1991 |last1=Bahr |first1=R. |last2=Høstmark |first2=A.

==Duration of the effect==
The EPOC effect is greatest soon after the exercise is completed and decays to a lower level over time. One experiment found EPOC increasing [[metabolism|metabolic]] rate to an excess level that decays to 13% three hours after exercise, and 4% after 16 hours.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Another study, specifically designed to test whether the effect existed for more than 16 hours, conducted tests for 48 hours after the conclusion of the exercise and found measurable effects existed up to the 38-hour post-exercise measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00421-001-0568-y |pmid=11882927 |pages=411–7 |title=Effect of an acute period of resistance exercise on excess post-exercise oxygen consumption: Implications for body mass management |journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=86 |issue=5 |year=2002 |last1=Schuenke |first1=Mark |last2=Mikat |first2=Richard |last3=McBride |first3=Jeffrey }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size of the EPOC effect==
{{Original research section|date=November 2016}}
Studies show that the EPOC effect exists after both [[anaerobic exercise]] and [[aerobic exercise]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Such comparisons are problematic, however, in that it is difficult to equalize and subsequently compare workloads between the two types of exercise.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} For exercise regimens of comparable duration and intensity, aerobic exercise burns more [[calorie]]s during the exercise itself,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} but the difference is partly offset by the higher increase in caloric expenditure that occurs during the EPOC phase after anaerobic exercise.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Anaerobic exercise in the form of [[high-intensity interval training]] was also found in one study to result in greater loss of [[adipose tissue|subcutaneous fat]], even though the subjects expended fewer than half as many calories during exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0026-0495(94)90259-3 |pmid=8028502 |title=Impact of exercise intensity on body fatness and skeletal muscle metabolism |journal=Metabolism |volume=43 |issue=7 |pages=814–8 |year=1994 |last1=Tremblay |first1=Angelo |last2=Simoneau |first2=Jean-Aimé |last3=Bouchard |first3=Claude }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this result was caused by the EPOC effect has not been established, and the caloric content of the participants' diet was not controlled during this particular study period.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In a 1992 Purdue study, results showed that high intensity, anaerobic type exercise resulted in a significantly greater magnitude of EPOC than aerobic exercise of equal work output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schmidt |first=Wilfred Daniel |year=1992 |title=The effects of chronic and acute dehydration on high power exercise performance |type=Ph.D. dissertation |publisher=Purdue University |oclc=13508540}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most researchers use a measure of EPOC as a natural part of the quantification or measurement of exercise and recovery energy expenditure; to others this is not deemed necessary. After a single bout or set of weight lifting, Scott et al. found considerable contributions of EPOC to total energy expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e31818c2845 |pmid=19197214 |pages=611–8 |title=Energy Expenditure Before, During, and After the Bench Press |journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research |volume=23 |issue=2 |year=2009 |last1=Scott |first1=Christopher B |last2=Croteau |first2=Alicia |last3=Ravlo |first3=Tyler }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2004 survey of the relevant literature, Meirelles and Gomes found: "In summary, EPOC resulting from a single resistance exercise ''session'' (i.e., many lifts) does not represent a great impact on energy balance; however, its cumulative effect may be relevant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S1517-86922004000200006 |title=Efeitos agudos da atividade contra-resistência sobre o gasto energético: revisitando o impacto das principais variáveis |trans-title=Acute effects of resistance exercise on energy expenditure: revisiting the impact of the training variables |language= Portuguese |year=2004 |last1=Meirelles |first1=Cláudia de Mello |last2=Gomes |first2=Paulo Sergio Chagas |journal=Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=122–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is echoed by Reynolds and Kravitz in their survey of the literature where they remarked: "the overall weight-control benefits of EPOC, for men and women, from participation in resistance exercise occur over a significant time period, since kilocalories are expended at a low rate in the individual post-exercise sessions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reynolds |first1=Jeff M |last2=Kravitz |first2=Len |year=2001 |title=Resistance training and EPOC |journal=IDEA Personal Trainer |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=17–9 |url=http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/epoc.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPOC effect clearly increases with the intensity of the exercise, and (at least in the case of aerobic exercise, perhaps also for anaerobic) the duration of the exercise.&lt;ref name=pmid14599232&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00007256-200333140-00002 |pmid=14599232 |pages=1037–60 |title=Effect of Exercise Intensity, Duration and Mode on Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=33 |issue=14 |year=2003 |last1=Børsheim |first1=Elisabet |last2=Bahr |first2=Roald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies comparing intermittent and continuous exercise consistently show a greater EPOC response for higher intensity, intermittent exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-010X(19980201)280:2&lt;114::AID-JEZ2&gt;3.0.CO;2-R |pmid=9433798 |pages=114–20 |title=EPOC and the energetics of brief locomotor activity in ''Mus'' domesticus |journal=The Journal of Experimental Zoology |volume=280 |issue=2 |year=1998 |last1=Baker |first1=Emily J. |last2=Gleeson |first2=Todd T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Goodwood Cricket Club''' is a Sunday village cricket team that play during the summer in the grounds of Goodwood Park, near [[Chichester]]. The ground overlooks [[Goodwood House]] and is owned by the Duke of Richmond and Gordon.

It is thought to be one of the oldest [[cricket]] clubs in the world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  It had strong links with [[Lord's]], as the 4th [[Duke]] was one of the original backers of [[Thomas Lord]].

Today, the club and ground is owned by the Duke of Richmond and Gordon but run by a group of [[volunteering|volunteers]] that make up the Goodwood Cricket Club . The Club has formed an alliance with Chichester Priory Park Cricket Club and their 1st and 2nd XIs play at the ground on Saturdays.

==History ==

A receipt for [[brandy]], given to the players, records Goodwood's earliest known game in 1702.
[[Image:Goodwood Cricket Club cricket pitch.jpg|thumb|280px|left|A view from the club pavilion, overlooking Goodwood House]]
In 1727 in Goodwood Park, a game was played between the 2nd Duke of Richmond and Mr Brodrick of Peper Harow Park, near Godalming (cricket is still played there today). As was common in those days there was a wager on the match and a set of rules was drawn up. These rules are the oldest set of written cricket rules in existence, today, in the world. The originals are kept in Goodwood House, with a copy in the club pavilion and at Lord's.	
The Club has a strong link with Lord's.  The 4th Duke, was one of the original backers of Thomas Lord when he bought 'the rough piece of land' in St John's Wood and the 5th Duke was President of the MCC. The present Duke was President/Patron of Sussex CCC for 25 years.	
Another link with Lord's could be the club colours. These colours are the racing colours of the Dukes of Richmond, circa 1801.  Sometime after their use by the Dukes, and the cricket club, they also became the colours of the MCC circa 1888. Although they could also have links to the Nicholson’s Gin Company.			
For much of the clubs history the enormous Cedar of Lebanon tree has looked on such players as James Lillywhite, Captain of England (employee of the Duke) and in more recent times Ray Lindwall, Sir Colin Cowdrey, Ted Dexter, Jim Parks, John Snow, Graham Gooch, Nasser Hussain, Devon Malcolm, Gladstone Small, Simon Jones, Adam Hollioake, Nick Compton and Sam Robson to name but a few. The tree was planted as a seed in 1752 and planted out on the ground in 1756. 
There has been one 1st class match at Goodwood, this was played on 22-23 July 1814 between Lord F Beauclerk’s XI and G Osbaldeston’s XI. The match was scheduled for three days but was over in two. A total of 265 runs were scored in 4 innings, 44 wickets taken and G Osbaldeston’s XI won by 17 runs.

'''Hyde Road''' was a [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[West Gorton]], [[Manchester]], England. It was home to [[Manchester City F.C.]] and their predecessors from its construction in 1887 until 1923, when the club moved to [[Maine Road]]. It was named after [[A57 road#Manchester - Sheffield|Hyde Road]], a road which begins at the east end of Ardwick Green South in [[Ardwick]] and runs east towards [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]]. At the boundary between Gorton and [[Denton, Greater Manchester|Denton]] it continues as Manchester Road.&lt;ref&gt;''Geographia Manchester Colour Map''. London: Geographia, 1986 {{ISBN|0-09-218190-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before its use as a football ground, the site was an area of waste ground, and in its early days the ground had only rudimentary facilities. The first stand was built in 1888, but the ground had no changing facilities until 1896;  players had to change in a nearby public house, the Hyde Road Hotel. By 1904 the ground had developed into a 40,000-capacity venue, hosting an [[FA Cup]] semi-final between [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]] the following year.

The stands and terraces were arranged in a haphazard manner due to space constraints, and by 1920 the club had outgrown the cramped venue. A decision to seek an alternative venue was hastened in November 1920, when the Main Stand was destroyed by fire. Manchester City moved to the 80,000-capacity [[Maine Road]] in 1923, and Hyde Road was demolished shortly afterward. One structure from the ground is still in use in the 21st century, a section of roofing which was sold for use at [[The Shay]], a stadium in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]].

==History==
From the club's inception in 1880, Manchester City - first known as St Mark's (West Gorton), then as West Gorton A.F.C. and by mid-1884 as just Gorton A.F.C. - [[early grounds of Manchester City F.C.|had struggled to find]] a stable location to base themselves. Originally simply playing on a dangerously bumpy patch of grass near to the church of their origin, the club quickly signed an agreement to ground-share with the Kirkmanshulme Cricket Club before being turfed out only a year later. Three further pitches were then created on wasteland over the following four seasons, but all proved inadequate for one reason or another. When their fifth pitch arrangement collapsed in 1887, with the landlord of the Bulls Head Hotel demanding a rent increase for the use of a nearby field, the club were forced to seek an alternative venue.&lt;ref name="CR82"&gt;James, ''Manchester City – The Complete Record'', p82&lt;/ref&gt; Then-captain Kenneth McKenzie discovered an area of waste ground on Hyde Road in [[Ardwick]] and near to his place of work, and informed the club committee.&lt;ref name="Inglis"&gt;Inglis, ''The Football Grounds of Great Britain'' (2nd ed.), p62&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Furniss]], the club secretary, ascertained that the ground was owned by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Company. Following an initial letter of enquiry by Gorton player Walter Chew to railway company estate agent Edwin Barker,&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City'', p16&lt;/ref&gt; Furniss and Chew negotiated a seven-month lease at a cost of £10,&lt;ref name="CR82"/&gt; and the club changed its name to "Ardwick A.F.C." to reflect the new location. A few weeks later, using materials provided by the nearby Galloway engineering works,&lt;ref name="Ward6"&gt;Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p6&lt;/ref&gt; a rudimentary football ground was ready for use. The ground had no changing rooms, and teams changed in a nearby [[public house]], the Hyde Road Hotel, where the football club held business meetings. The ground's first seating area was built in 1888, with 1,000&amp;nbsp;seats,&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City'', p18&lt;/ref&gt; paid for by Chesters Brewery in return for the right to be the sole provider of alcohol inside the ground.&lt;ref name="Ward6"/&gt; Ardwick were admitted to the [[Football League]] in 1892. The first league match held at Hyde Road was a 7&amp;ndash;0 Ardwick win against [[Bootle F.C.|Bootle]] on 3 September 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p8&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the club reformed as "Manchester City F.C."

[[File:Hyderoadcapacity.PNG|thumb|left|From less than 5,000 in 1887, Hyde Road's capacity reached 40,000 by 1904.]]
The increasing popularity of the football club resulted in improvements being made to the ground on several occasions. Improvements costing £600 were made in 1890, and changing rooms were provided in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City'', p32&lt;/ref&gt; A new stand was purchased for £1,500 in 1898, and £2,000 worth of improvements were made in 1904, resulting in a capacity of 40,000 with stands on three sides.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p12&lt;/ref&gt; This development resulted in Hyde Road being chosen to host two prestigious matches&amp;mdash;an inter-league match between the English League and the Irish League, and an [[FA Cup]] semi-final between [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]].&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City – The Complete Record'', p84&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 multi-span roofing was built on the three previously uncovered sides of the ground, resulting in covered accommodation for 35,000&amp;nbsp;spectators.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City'', p77&lt;/ref&gt; 

Even though improvements were made the ground suffered problems when hosting large crowds, due to narrow surrounding streets and a shortage of [[turnstile]]s.&lt;ref name="J88"/&gt; A reporter for the ''Manchester Football News'' summarised the access problems: "The croft is a nightmare in wet weather, and altogether the approach is easily the worst of any I know".&lt;ref&gt;Collins, ''All-round Genius'', p95&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, further problems occurred inside the ground as well as outside. A 1913 cup tie against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] drew a crowd officially recorded as 41,709, but believed to be significantly higher. An hour before kick-off the gates were closed, with many ticket-holders unable to gain admission. The crowd was so large that once the match kicked off the crowd began to spill onto the pitch, a problem which worsened as the game progressed. Sunderland's [[Charlie Buchan|Charles Buchan]] recalled that "Before half-time they were three or four yards inside the touchlines." A Sunderland goal in the 58th minute caused further encroachment, forcing the referee to abandon the match.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City'', pp83–84&lt;/ref&gt; An FA inquiry into the events on the terraces gave rise to debate on the issue of crowd control at sporting events. Use of mounted police was a particularly contentious issue, the chairman of the committee asking "If the ball struck a horse, and the creature plunged among the people, who was to be held responsible for any injuries that might accrue?"&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p20&lt;/ref&gt; For years the club contemplated moving but between 1912 and 1914 renowned football stadium architect [[Archibald Leitch]] worked with the club to remodel the Hyde Road site.&lt;ref&gt;Athletic News, 9 June 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:Shay Stadium, Halifax.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Shay]], Halifax, in 2006. The left hand portion of the pictured stand's roof was originally used at Hyde Road.]]
During the suspension of competitive football in the [[First World War]], Hyde Road's redevelopment was put on hold and the venue was used to stable 300&amp;nbsp;horses.&lt;ref name="Inglis"/&gt; Later in the wartime period the club became the sole leaseholder of the ground, no longer dependent upon support from Chesters brewery. At this point the annual rent was £500.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p21&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, the ground became the first football venue outside London to be visited by a reigning monarch; [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] attended the ground to watch a match between Manchester City and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November a fire caused by a cigarette end destroyed the Main Stand, and Manchester City began to seek a new home. Initial discussions raised the possibility of sharing [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]] with neighbours [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], but United's proposed rent was prohibitive, so repair work was undertaken and Manchester City continued to play at Hyde Road.&lt;ref name="MGC480"&gt;James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City'', p480&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for the club to move to a new ground&amp;mdash;[[Maine Road]]&amp;mdash;in [[Moss Side]] were announced in 1922. The final Manchester City match at Hyde Road was a league fixture against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 28 April 1923,&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City'', p104&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 1923 a public practice game was the last football match played at Hyde Road.&lt;ref name="MGC480"/&gt; Manchester City began the [[1923-24 in English football|1923&amp;ndash;24 season]] at Maine Road, which had an 80,000 capacity. Parts of Hyde Road were used elsewhere; the roof of the Main Stand was sold to [[Halifax Town F.C.|Halifax Town]], and erected at [[The Shay]], where even in the 21st century, part of the Hyde Road roof is still in place.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, ''Everything under the blue moon'', p107&lt;/ref&gt; Within a decade, all traces of the football ground had disappeared from Hyde Road. The bulk of the area was taken over by Manchester Corporation Tramways department, whose major Hyde Road depot and works was alongside, for use as their Permanent Way yard for assembling and storing tramway rails and materials. The Tramways system also provided at this time a substantial parcels handling service within the city, using both vans and special parcels trams, and a new central parcels depot was built on the Bennett Street side of the former site, against the railway viaduct. After the end of Manchester's trams in 1949 (most of the old trams were scrapped on this site) it was used for storing old buses and as a bus drivers' training area. As of 2000, the site of the pitch is Olympic Freight Terminal, a container storage and warehousing facility.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, ''Everything under the blue moon'', p108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout and structure==
For certain areas of the ground few photographs survive, however, a map dating from 1894 indicates that most of the terracing was of uneven shape, and that unusually, a section of railway line leading to a neighbouring boilerworks ran between the terrace and the pitch at one corner of the ground. The main grandstand (the "Main Stand") was situated at the north of the ground. Built in 1889 for £1,500, this structure replaced the original 1,000 capacity grandstand which had been built in 1888. The new grandstand comprised an upper tier of seating and a lower paddock. Most contemporary sources listed the capacity as 4,000, though it is unclear whether this refers to the [[seating capacity]] or the total capacity.&lt;ref name=J87&gt;James, ''Manchester City – The Complete Record'', p87&lt;/ref&gt; The wooden stand was gutted by fire in 1920, causing the loss of both the stand and the club records, which were stored within.&lt;ref name="Inglis"/&gt;

The north-eastern end of the ground was known as the "Galloway End". It was intersected by a railway loop leading to the Galloway boilerworks. One part of the terracing was known as the "Boys Stand".  This was a separate structure, slightly removed from the rest of the ground and positioned behind the railway loop line which transported boilers from Galloways Boiler Works.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City – The Complete Record'', First Edition, p.&amp;nbsp;100–101&lt;/ref&gt; The opposing end, known as the "Stone Yard Stand" or "Hotel End", was another part of the ground with an irregular shape. It consisted of a mixture of seats and terracing, and became the most important seating area in the period following the Main Stand fire.&lt;ref name=J87/&gt; The fourth side was a simple terrace, with a roof covering three-quarters of its length. It had a larger capacity than the other parts of the ground, and was therefore known as "The Popular Side".&lt;ref name=J88&gt;James, ''Manchester City – The Complete Record'', p88&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the terrace stood back-to-back with a row of houses on Bennett Street; though the ground was named Hyde Road, its proximity to Bennett Street meant that for some supporters the names Hyde Road and Bennett Street were synonymous.

==Hyde Road Hotel==
Adjacent to the ground was the Hyde Road Hotel, a public house in which the players got changed before the matches at the Hyde Road stadium. It served as the venue for several important events in the club's history, such as first meeting of Ardwick A.F.C. on 30 August 1887, and the 1894 decision to form Manchester City F.C. and register it as a company. During this period the owners of the Hyde Road Hotel, Chesters Brewery, had a large influence over the football club, leading Ardwick to be nicknamed "The Brewerymen".&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City'', p17&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s the Hyde Road Hotel was owned by [[George Heslop]], a former Manchester City player, and was renamed "The City Gates". The business failed, closing in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City'', p355&lt;/ref&gt; and the building subsequently lay empty for more than a decade. Attempts to save the building were made by Manchester City supporters, without much progress. By May 2001, the building was demolished.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City'', pp18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Two keystones from the Hyde Road Hotel reside in the memorial garden at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City – The Complete Record'', p24&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kamariny Stadium''' was opened by the Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] in 1958.  A plaque stands a few metres from the track that once bore her name. It is a public cinder track built to a British standard where four laps measures one imperial mile.

The stadium is 2&amp;nbsp;km outside the town of [[Iten]], the capital of [[Elgeyo-Marakwet County]], in [[Kenya]].

The '''Kazakhstan national rugby union team''', nicknamed "The Nomads", is controlled by the [[Kazakhstan Rugby Union]].
Kazakhstan have been participating in international competition since 1994 after their independence from the [[USSR]].

In 2007, the fortunes of the team greatly improved by winning all five of their matches and rising 14 places in the [[IRB World Rankings]] to 32nd. This rise was the biggest by any international team over the year. This led to the team being entered into the top division of the new [[Asian Five Nations]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irb.com/rankings/news/newsid=2021676.html International Rugby Board – 2007 rankings highs and lows]. 28 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazakhstan are now one of the leading rugby union nations in Asia, finishing second in the [[2009 Asian Five Nations|2009]] and [[2010 Asian Five Nations]] to continent heavyweights Japan on both occasions. Their second-place finish in 2010 saw them advance to the four-team playoff for a final place at the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]]. They lost 44–7 to [[Uruguay national rugby union team|Uruguay]] in Montevideo, being eliminated but it was still their best result yet.

They have yet to qualify for a [[Rugby World Cup]] finals.

==Game length records==

===Longest game===
The longest tournament chess game (in terms of moves) ever to be played was Nikolić–Arsović, [[Belgrade]] 1989, which lasted for 269 moves and took 20 hours and 15 minutes to complete a [[draw (chess)|drawn]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1268705|title=Ivan Nikolic vs Goran Arsovic (1989)|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924121201/http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1268705|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krabbé Chess records"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/records/records.htm|title=Chess records © Tim Krabbé|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150619100708/http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/records/records.htm|archivedate=19 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time this game was played, [[FIDE]] had modified the [[fifty-move rule]] to allow 100 moves to be played without a piece being captured in a [[rook and bishop versus rook endgame]], the situation in Nikolić versus Arsović. FIDE has since rescinded that modification to the rule.

The longest decisive tournament game is [[Alexandre Danin|Danin]]–[[Sergei Azarov|Azarov]], [[Turnov]] 2016, which Danin won in 239 moves.&lt;ref name="Chess database"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess-db.com/public/game.jsp?id=4144031.13501470.108494081.29187|title=Alexandre Danin vs. Sergei Azarov (2016)|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th round of THT Extraliga (highest Czech team league), Danin needed to win his game to make the match end in a 4:4 draw. Although he managed to do that, his team (TŽ Třinec) was relegated from the highest league in the end.

The second longest decisive tournament game is [[Laurent Fressinet|Fressinet]]–[[Alexandra Kosteniuk|Kosteniuk]], [[Villandry]] 2007, which Kosteniuk won in 237 moves.&lt;ref name="Krabbé Chess records" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1536839|title=Laurent Fressinet vs Alexandra Kosteniuk (2007)|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617164423/http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1536839|archivedate=17 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last 116 moves were a rook and bishop versus rook ending, as in Nikolić – Arsović. Fressinet could have claimed a draw under the fifty-move rule, but did not do so since neither player was keeping score, it being a [[rapid chess]] game. Earlier in the tournament, [[Viktor Korchnoi|Korchnoi]] had successfully invoked the rule to claim a draw against Fressinet; the arbiters overruled Fressinet's argument that Korchnoi could not do so without keeping score. Fressinet, apparently wanting to be consistent, did not try to claim a draw against Kosteniuk in the same situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=4210 A chess feast in Château de Villandry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604174831/http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=4210 |date=2011-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest game played in a [[World Chess Championship|world championship]] is the fifth game of the 1978 match between Korchnoi and [[Anatoly Karpov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1068051 |title = Viktor Korchnoi vs Anatoly Karpov |publisher = Chessgames.com |accessdate = 2017-01-13 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170927131425/http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1068051 |archivedate = 2017-09-27 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Korchnoi's 124th move, as White, produced [[stalemate]].

===Shortest game===
====Shortest decisive game====
The fewest moves required to deliver checkmate in chess is two, in what is known as [[Fool's mate]] ('''1. g4 e5 2. f3[[Chess_annotation_symbols#.3F.3F_.28Blunder.29|??]] Qh4#''' and variants thereof). This has been known to occur in amateur play. [[Chessgames.com]] gives a game L. Darling–R. Wood, 1983, that was published on [[April Fool's Day]] in ''Northwest Chess'' magazine ('''1. g4 e6 2. f4?? Qh4#''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1251128|title=Lance Darling vs Richard Wood (1983)|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617164426/http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1251128|archivedate=17 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Wall lists, in addition to Darling–Wood, three other games that ended with Black checkmating on the second move.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090803195030/http://geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7378/short1.txt Miniatures]. Retrieved on 2009-01-04.&lt;/ref&gt; In a tournament game at [[Chess handicap|odds]] of {{chessgloss|pawn and move}}, White delivered [[checkmate]] on move 2: W. Cooke-"R____g", Cape Town Chess Club handicap tournament 1908 (remove Black's f-pawn) '''1. e4 g5?? 2. Qh5#'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Winter (chess historian)|Edward Winter]], [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/#5857._Maxim Chess Note 5858] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429230555/http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/ |date=2017-04-29 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same game had previously been played in Leeky-Mason, Dublin 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Winter|2003|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one counts forfeited games as a loss in zero moves,&lt;ref&gt;It counts as a loss for tournament score, but not for rating calculations where a forfeit is treated as an unplayed game.&lt;/ref&gt; then there have been many such forfeits, the most notable examples being Game 2 of the [[World Chess Championship 1972|1972 world championship match]] between [[Boris Spassky]] and [[Bobby Fischer]], which Fischer defaulted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Brady|1973|pp=244–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Game 5 of the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2006|2006 world championship match]] between [[Vladimir Kramnik]] and [[Veselin Topalov]], which Kramnik defaulted.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chess Informant]]'', Volume 98, Šahovski Informator, 2007, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under recently instituted [[FIDE]] rules, a player who is late for the beginning of a round loses the game, as does a player who has forbidden electronic device (by default any device). The former rule was used at the 2009 Chinese Championship to forfeit [[Hou Yifan]] for arriving five seconds late for the beginning of a round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2009/06/new-rule-good-or-bad-you-decide.html New rule. Good or bad? You decide.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217170147/http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2009/06/new-rule-good-or-bad-you-decide.html |date=2012-02-17 }} susanpolgar.blogspot.com. Retrieved on 2009-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter rule was used to forfeit [[Aleksander Delchev]] against [[Stuart Conquest]] after the move 1.d4 in the 2009 European Team Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5867|title=Novi Sad: another loss by ringtone|date=2009-10-25|publisher=ChessBase News|accessdate=2009-10-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20091027000000/http://chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5867|archivedate=2009-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Robert Hübner]] also lost a game without playing any moves. In a World Student Team Championship game played in Graz in 1972, Hübner played one move and offered a draw to [[Kenneth Rogoff]], who accepted. However, the arbiters insisted that some moves be played, so the players played the following ridiculous game: '''1. c4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Ng1 Bg7 4. Qa4 0-0 5. Qxd7 Qxd7 6. g4 Qxd2+ 7. Kxd2 Nxg4 8. b4 a5 9. a4 Bxa1 10. Bb2 Nc6 11. Bh8 Bg7 12. h4 axb4''' (draw agreed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1543378|title=Robert Huebner vs Kenneth S Rogoff (1972) Going Rogoff|author=|date=|website=www.chessgames.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714010853/http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1543378|archivedate=14 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arbiters ruled that both players must apologize and play an actual game at 7 p.m. Rogoff appeared and apologized; Hübner did neither.

More rarely, a player might decide to protest by resigning a game rather than forfeiting. A game between Fischer and [[Oscar Panno]], played at the [[Palma de Mallorca]] [[Interzonal]] 1970, went '''1. c4 Black resigns'''. Panno refused to play to protest the organizers' rescheduling of the game to accommodate Fischer's desire not to play on his religion's [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. Panno was not present when the game was to begin. Fischer waited ten minutes before making his move and went to get Panno to convince him to play. Fifty-two minutes had elapsed on Panno's clock before he came to the board and resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Brady|1973|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Wade|O'Connell|1973|pp=344, 410}}&lt;/ref&gt; (At the time, an absence of sixty minutes resulted in a forfeit.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Brady|1973|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The shortest decisive tournament game that was decided because of the position on the board (i.e. not because of a forfeit or protest) is Z. Đorđević–M. Kovačević, Bela Crkva 1984.

====Shortest draw====
A game may be [[draw (chess)|drawn]] by mutual agreement in any number of moves. Traditionally, it has been common for players to agree a "[[grandmaster draw]]" after playing about 10-15 moves of known [[chess opening theory|opening theory]] and making no serious effort to win. This is usually done to preserve energy in a tournament, after a devastating loss in the previous round of the tournament, or in the final round when no prize money is at stake. There has been some debate over the ethics of the practice, and recently there has been a trend away from such games, with many tournaments adopting [[Draw by agreement#Steps taken to discourage draws or short draws|measures to discourage short draws]]. If the tournament officials (unlike those at Graz and Lishui) do not object, a game may even be agreed drawn without a single move being played. According to [[ChessGames.com]], in the 1968 [[Skopje]]–[[Ohrid]] tournament [[Dragoljub Janosevic]] and [[Efim Geller]] agreed to a draw without playing any moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1263859|title=Dragoljub Janosevic vs Efim Geller (1968)|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509190144/http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1263859|archivedate=9 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Miles]] and [[Stewart Reuben]] did the same thing in the last round of the [[Luton]] 1975 tournament, "with the blessing of the controller", in order to assure themselves of first and second places respectively.&lt;ref name="Whyld 1986 124"&gt;{{Harv|Whyld|1986|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Fox|James|1993|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than those unplayed games, the shortest game in a world championship was the 21st match game in the [[World Chess Championship 1963]] between [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] and [[Tigran Petrosian]].

==Playing records==

===Consecutive wins against masters===
[[Wilhelm Steinitz]] won his last 16 games at Vienna 1873, including a two-game playoff against Blackburne at the end. He played no serious chess until an 1876 match against Blackburne that Steinitz swept 7–0. After a long period of inactivity, Steinitz played at Vienna 1882, where he won his first two games before finally ending his winning streak with a draw.  Steinitz's 25-game winning streak over nine years has never been equaled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Soltis|2002|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, [[Bobby Fischer]] won 20 consecutive games, all in competitions at late stages of the [[World Chess Championship|world championship]] cycle. (Some commentators give this as 19, electing not to count Fischer's game against [[Oscar Panno]], who resigned after Fischer's first move as a protest). Fischer won his last seven games at the 1970 [[Palma de Mallorca]] [[Interzonal]] (including the one-move game against Panno), then swept [[Mark Taimanov]] 6–0 in the quarterfinals followed by [[Bent Larsen]] by the same score in the semifinals. In the Candidates Match final, Fischer beat former World Champion [[Tigran Petrosian]] in the first game before Petrosian snapped the streak by winning the second match game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Soltis|2002|pp=43, 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This record was for many years held by [[Mikhail Tal]], who between October 23, 1973, when he lost to [[Tigran Petrosian]] in the 15th round of the [[Soviet Chess Championship|Soviet championship]], and October 16, 1974, when he lost to [[Nino Kirov]] at the [[Novi Sad]] tournament, had a string of 95 tournament games without a loss (46 wins and 49 draws).&lt;!-- (This does not count an {{chessgloss|simultaneous chess|exhibition}} game that was an adjudicated a loss for Tal in his 1974 [[telex]] match against eight [[Australia]]ns.) --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Soltis|2002|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Tal|1976|p=500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Most wins against world champions===
[[Paul Keres]], [[Viktor Korchnoi]], and [[Alexander Beliavsky]] are the only chess players to have defeated 9 undisputed world champions in classical games. 
* Keres defeated every world champion from Capablanca (3rd) to Fischer (11th): [[José Raúl Capablanca]], [[Alexander Alekhine]], [[Max Euwe]], [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], [[Vasily Smyslov]], [[Mikhail Tal]], [[Tigran Petrosian]], [[Boris Spassky]], [[Bobby Fischer]].
* Korchnoi defeated every undisputed world champion from Botvinnik (6th) to Kasparov (13th), and also Carlsen:  Botvinnik, Smyslov, Tal, Petrosian, Spassky, Fischer, [[Anatoly Karpov]], [[Garry Kasparov]], [[Magnus Carlsen]]. 
* Beliavsky has defeated every undisputed world champion from Smyslov (7th) to Carlsen (16th), except for Fischer: Botvinnik, Smyslov, Tal, Petrosian, Spassky, Karpov, Kasparov, [[Vladimir Kramnik]], [[Viswanathan Anand]], Carlsen.

Korchnoi and Beliavsky would both move to 10 if [[Fabiano Caruana]] were to win the [[World Chess Championship 2018]].

If disputed world champions are included, then [[Garry Kasparov]], Korchnoi, and Beliavsky share the record at 11. Kasparov has defeated 7 undisputed world champions (Smyslov, Tal, Petrosian, Spassky, Karpov, Kramnik, Anand) as well as 4 FIDE world champions ([[Alexander Khalifman]], [[Ruslan Ponomariov]], [[Rustam Kasimdzhanov]] and [[Veselin Topalov]]). Korchnoi defeated the 9 mentioned above, plus FIDE champions Ponomariov and Topalov. Beliavsky defeated the 9 mentioned above, plus FIDE-only champions Khalifman and Topalov. Note: classical games, no rapid, blitz or simuls.
&lt;!-- Nigel Short and Judit Polgar sometimes claim 11 or 12, but that's only if rapid and simuls are included -- see [[Talk:Nigel Short]] --&gt;

If draws are included, Korchnoi has beaten or drawn 11 undisputed world chess champions in a row in classical games (he had draws against Anand and Kramnik) and all 4 disputed world champions (draws against Khalifman and Kasimdzhanov) - that is, every one since Alekhine's death in 1946.

==Age-related records==

===Youngest grandmaster===
The youngest player to be awarded the [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] title by FIDE is [[Sergey Karjakin]]. In 2002 he qualified for the title at the age of 12 years, 7 months, and 0 days. See [[List of youngest grandmasters]] for the history of this record.

===Oldest grandmaster===
Several players have been awarded honorary or retrospective grandmaster titles based on their past achievements. The oldest of these was [[Enrico Paoli]], who was awarded the title in 1996 at the age of 88.

Apart from retrospective awards, a number of players have achieved the title by winning the [[World Senior Chess Championship|World Senior Championship]]. The oldest player to gain the title in this way was [[Yuri Shabanov]], who won the 2003 event and was awarded the title at the age of 66.

===Youngest player to defeat a grandmaster===

On July 28, 2012, [[Awonder Liang]], aged 9 years, 3 months, and 20 days, beat Grandmaster [[Larry Kaufman]] in the Washington International tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2012/07/a-new-record-by-awonder.html A new record by Awonder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127035310/http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2012/07/a-new-record-by-awonder.html |date=2012-11-27 }} (July 30, 2012).

==Simultaneous and blindfold records==

===Best and worst results in simultaneous exhibitions===

In 1922, [[José Raúl Capablanca]], the recently crowned [[World Champion]], played 103 opponents simultaneously in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]. He completed the exhibition in seven hours, scoring 102 wins and one draw (99.5%), the best result ever in a simultaneous exhibition on over 75 boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Damsky|2005|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Chernev|1974|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best result in a simultaneous exhibition solely against [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmasters]] is former World Champion [[Garry Kasparov]]'s performance against an [[Israel]]i team consisting of [[Boris Alterman]], [[Alexander Huzman]], [[Ilya Smirin]], and [[Emil Sutovsky]] at [[Tel Aviv]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chessgames.com]], [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1016404 Kasparov's super simuls] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718014502/http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1016404 |date=2014-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the difficulty Kasparov played Black in half the games; usually in exhibitions the exhibitor plays White on all boards.  A second round was played 2 days later with colors reversed.  Kasparov scored 7-1 against an all 2600+ rated team and considers it one of the peak performances of his career.

[[Paul Morphy]] also gave an impressive exhibition. On April 26, 1859, at London's St. James Chess Club, Morphy played "five games simultaneously against a group of masters who could be described as among the top ten players of the day", scoring 3–2. He defeated [[Jules Arnous de Rivière]] and [[Henry Bird (chess player)|Henry Bird]], drew [[Samuel Boden]] and [[Johann Löwenthal]], and lost only to [[Thomas Wilson Barnes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Soltis|2002|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The worst result in a simultaneous exhibition given by a [[master (chess)|master]] occurred in 1951, when [[International Master]] [[Robert Wade (chess player)|Robert Wade]] gave a simultaneous exhibition against 30 Russian schoolboys, aged 14 and under. After 7 hours of play, Wade had lost 20 games and [[drew (chess)|drawn]] the remaining 10 (16.7%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Kotov|1964|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Chernev|1974|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Fox|James|1993|pp=170–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GM [[Alexander Kotov]] wrote that former World Champion [[Max Euwe]] warned new arrivals in Moscow, "Just don't give exhibitions against Pioneers" (i.e. students at the [[Pioneers Palace|Palaces of the Pioneers]]) {{Harv|Kotov|1964|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Most games in blindfold exhibitions===
[[Miguel Najdorf]] played against 45 opponents in a simultaneous [[Blindfold chess|blindfold]] exhibition given at [[Sao Paulo]] in 1947, winning 39, losing 2 and drawing 4 games (after a similar display in Rosario, Argentina, in 1943, against 40 players).&lt;ref&gt;Hearst and Knott 2009, pp. 93-98.&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Janos Flesch]] (52 games) claimed to have broken this record, but his exhibition was not properly monitored and so it was not recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Hearst and Knott in their book on blindfold chess give a number of reasons for not crediting Flesch's claimed record, including the large number of very short games, relatively weak opposition, note-taking by Flesch during the exhibition, possible prearrangement of games, the apparent falsity of Flesch's claim that [[FIDE]] ratified his claimed record, that Flesch played 12 of the 52 games as Black, the inaccessibility/disappearance of game scores and the documentary film, and opinions from other chess experts questioning Flesch's claim. Hearst and Knott 2009, pp. 103-09.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, little-known German master Marc Lang broke Najdorf's record, playing 46 opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marc Lang catches the eye by breaking world blindfold record |author=Leonard Barden |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 December 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/30/chess-marc-lang-blindfold |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118083103/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/30/chess-marc-lang-blindfold |archivedate=18 January 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was subsequently beaten by [[Timur Gareyev]] in December 2016, when he played 48 opponents over 20 hours, scoring 35 wins, 7 draws and 6 losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/48-blindfold-boards-the-tale-behind-the-record|title=48 blindfold boards - The tale behind the record|publisher=Chessbase|date=14 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602094823/http://en.chessbase.com/post/48-blindfold-boards-the-tale-behind-the-record|archivedate=2 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Most players taking part in a multi-simul===
On October 21, 2006, a gigantic multi-simul was organized in ''El Zócalo'', [[Mexico City]]'s central square. About 600 masters played against 20 to 25 opponents each. The total number of players was 13,446 according to the authorities. The tables were arranged in squares of different colors, each containing seven simuls. The square resembled in this way a giant chessboard. [[Anatoly Karpov]] was a guest at the event but did not play in the simuls as he was busy signing 1951 copies of his latest book.  ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' acknowledged the event as the largest one held in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3446|title=Guinness Chess Records in Mexico City|work=Chess News|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108073210/http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3446|archivedate=8 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played for 25 hours against 604 players, winning 580 (97.35%) of the games, drawing 16, and losing 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/4-tournaments/5055-world-record-604-board-simultaneous-chess-exhibition-by-gm-ehsan-ghaem-maghami-iri.html |title=World Record 604 Board Simultaneous Chess Exhibition by GM Ehsan Ghaem Maghami (IRI) |publisher=Fide.com |date=2011-02-10 |accessdate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721164434/http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/4-tournaments/5055-world-record-604-board-simultaneous-chess-exhibition-by-gm-ehsan-ghaem-maghami-iri.html |archivedate=2015-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing-related records==

===Longest-running chess column===
[[Leonard Barden]]'s daily chess column for the [[London Evening Standard]] began in June 1956, and was published daily in the printed newspaper until July 30, 2010, a total run of 54 years and 1 month. It has since continued online, and is still running as of April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/barden-on-the-longest-running-chess-column |title=Barden on the longest running chess column |publisher=chessbase.com |date=2010-10-25 |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512073026/http://en.chessbase.com/post/barden-on-the-longest-running-chess-column |archivedate=2015-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/staticpage/chess/ |title=Chess - with Leonard Barden |publisher=Evening Standard |date=2015-04-17 |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404200842/https://www.standard.co.uk/staticpage/chess |archivedate=2018-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Best selling book===
The best selling chess book of all time is difficult to determine, but a strong candidate is ''[[Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess]]'' by Bobby Fischer, Stuart Marguiles and Don Mosenfelder, originally published in 1966 and selling over one million copies in the wake of the [[1972 World Chess Championship]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6483">A '''Little League home run''' is a play in [[baseball]] during which a [[Batting (baseball)|batter]] scores a [[Run (baseball)|run]] during his [[plate appearance]] with the aid of one or more [[Error (baseball)|errors]] committed by the [[Baseball rules#Fielding team|fielding team]]. It is so called because the play is presumably evocative of how young children in the process of learning how to play the [[baseball|sport]] frequently commit fielding and throwing errors that allow batters (as well as [[Base running|runners already on base]] during the [[Plate_appearance|at bat]]) to take more [[Base (baseball)|bases]] than they might otherwise normally take on the [[batted ball]] put into play. The term stems from [[Little League Baseball]], founded in 1939 as an organizing body for local youth baseball and softball leagues throughout the United States and the rest of the world.

Given the prevalence of such plays at the actual Little League level, the play is remarkable only when batters playing in advanced leagues, up to and including the [[Major League Baseball|major leagues]], commit such error-prone plays, since it is presumed that baseball players at the advanced amateur and professional levels are skillful enough to avoid them on a routine basis.

The first known effort to catalogue and report on incidences of Little League home runs at the major league level was undertaken by Chuck Hildebrandt, who presented his research to the annual conference of the [[Society of American Baseball Research]] (SABR) in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] on June 27, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabr.org/latest/sabr-45-hildebrandt-grilc-win-2015-presentation-awards|title=SABR 45: Hildebrandt, Grilc win 2015 presentation awards|publisher=SABR|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original definition of the Little League home run, announced during the presentation, was any play during which (1) the batter scores; and (2) two or more errors are committed by the fielding team, regardless as to whether the batter reaches base by way of error or [[Hit (baseball)|base hit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |title=‘Little League Home Runs’ in MLB History |author=Chuck Hildebrandt |date=June 27, 2015 |location=Chicago, Ill. |url=https://public.boxcloud.com/d/1/MeiSC1PCamji1dLkZ9s21viHdy7uaD55HHGVT57kqjp0fkotcHSDimuauXxKVF-pcVu_ohMIWIXaBaPmMZZ2ynsroS7ekvdaC0onK1nKmkHHlS0dONAhQJrpuZ8MWi0MxhLzEBZIQ6CA3MkuZRJM4bQ2C3dMNsH2ov45KbPOxdmfEuU_xih-XkVt9liJhnWk7m3nOwzzesKRKptMxZTHLN7whz7J7XnwUIa8dIzk8ZNTqb1M2cdZaCJ9mBInXg6cH03wl4_L7yD8Y_10PE13mkinD8WIdr34o_a7md34coG8kGFSFSjTw48jtCW-xmJd8NYWnboVB6zJqYWZFqRH48UpIlUj9y3zu2IyhqAHwSFBQmuzZpptvFbNPYepzgzdfylCVfoMuUcGNwy_iOcBMbYkfnm8i40bpYtjyK_2D2a2uOizSeFOrUvSKbEbGkkMW9vbJ-FZn5Y43xN2kbyUHEHsosCK-39BMTSLDLSQ5opK1SkE-egRO6nlhDS17L8xQhGQzsIq9V_HYkPi0_c_up3mJTZvh52a-pXc9JfdyUlbI9vjwo-je87BYSEdaEjzbgpq4F2k91L_nl8TQZBsEGAa8sTcZnQtsgfgRJcd4-_rWGEAXHKxFPxjVzuoARWQRlKUdr7FY_tgcoAt3ZzN3Stwt1VgI-Zwo8PaMEg_DeZ7fV7Wkm_pG5WrW6zsQMjpP_E7l0Aeeh6IUaX1abikzNBSOm47ycNIxz0ypvP2ugTniwZs9QOijI_94Dy3-8XLcrrFHe3liTORzOiBqpJaG3JdYP7_NqT6i1FwxkBhcY0ct9Xz3YRcvf35b9fiqaNCwS-CmpO-MbmtkamtOksSS06VDtebLoUlw228P8GeMBFj1bMinRUwMRPjsWl4t4BTsvTS-P11rByryD01hmnPei6sSyxjcKwnwQWd-ivFwDTTqaT73CPNJqRdN46Dvc7ckVcBk7V1-y_nayIxi33ghonjRTrOr29R3E5JgEJ7N4HHCuthxJc3rCmFxze0jRI5soYHPJeDJQiZqDu6xPUwLs0qBsLnMO88A9Za-5YS0WLZc8caKOo7QMzmkYWlfr-Tc8BOqB2EvTZy3yX9rLAF_td3L862_8nPk3p4-JNGHhU3gFSXaKkqz8xVbH6WG842dqEWT32wJ0O3Z_xzuKhD9NiNLtx4nradOWOFDE9XdPbvuXx1pZ5Mj4yvB98sGk6n2RczOe3UcBNGg0cl0xAaCzopLKNwGdJ2XuqruqEO4Pse1xOHtVfXHXD6kRIW-0PH_czhsUQA6A../download|access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was established to allow [[Information retrieval|queries]] to be run against a [[database]] of major league games for which play-by-play narrative is available, as maintained by [[Retrosheet]].

In a subsequent article published by Hildebrandt in SABR's [[Society for American Baseball Research#Publications|''Baseball Research Journal'']] in April 2017, the definition was expanded to reflect any play during which (1) the batter scores; and either (2a) two or more errors are committed by the fielding team, or (2b) one error is committed on a play which is not an [[extra-base hit]], provided the error is charged to a non-[[outfielder]] (i.e., meaning by any [[infielder]], the [[pitcher]], or the [[catcher]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tan|first1=Cecilia M.

As of the close of the 2017 major league baseball season, a total of 358 Little League home runs have been discovered to have occurred during the 163,081 games that are available for play-by-play query in the Retrosheet database, or roughly one LLHR for every 455 games available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IQe3WbWsRCHi1GP4OUfn1vnVpjtdjrs6/view|title=Little League Home Runs Database|publisher=SABR|date=|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plays are all consistent with the revised 2017 definition as described above, and have been all confirmed either through contemporary newspaper accounts, or by video or audio clips from the broadcasts of the games during which they occurred. 

The earliest known Little League home run discovered to date was made by [[Ty Cobb]] of the [[Detroit Tigers]] versus the [[Cleveland Naps]] on September 10, 1911,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16558426/llhr_9101911_cledet_ty_cobb/|title=TIGERS PUSH OVER WINNING TALLY IN THIRTEENTH INNING|publisher=Detroit Free Press, September 11, 1911|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly 28 years before the actual Little League organization itself was founded and available to lend its name to such a play. [[Fred Blanding]] was the Naps pitcher who yielded the Little League home run to Cobb.

The earliest known media account using the term "Little League home run" was a game recap written by [[Jeff Prugh]], [[California Angels]] [[beat writer]] for [[Los Angeles Times]], in reference to a Little League home run hit by [[Denny Doyle]] versus the [[Detroit Tigers]] on June 1, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8458305/little_league_home_run_1st_use_of_term/|title=Ryan's No-Hit Bid Ends in 8th|publisher=Los Angeles Times, June 2, 1974|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''London Ice House''' was an [[arena]] in [[London, Ontario]], Canada.  It was originally built in 1963 and was home to the [[London Knights]] [[ice hockey]] team from 1965 to 2002.  The arena had a capacity of approximately 5,000 and was designed as a one level [[Boston Garden]]. The arena was originally named '''Treasure Island Gardens''' as the building was a part of the Treasure Island Plaza mall complex located in south London. The arena also included a second ice pad but was eventually closed.&lt;ref name="ldngardens"&gt;http://www.ohlarenaguide.com/ldngardens.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[London Knights]] and the building were purchased by new owner Doug Tarry, who renamed building as the London Ice House.&lt;ref name="ldngardens"/&gt; Tarry upgraded the building in 1994, including replacing the seats on the sides and adding more emergency exits to bring the building up to the [[fire code]], but once the refurbishing was complete the team and building went downhill steadily, as Tarry preferred to allow the building to deteriorate as part of his lobbying the city for a new arena, given that they were the only team in the OHL who owned their own building without municipal assistance and taxes in excess of $125,000 per year in 1999.  The team was sold as the city warmed up to building a new facility. The London Knights underwent a renaissance after being purchased by [[Dale Hunter|Dale]] and [[Mark Hunter (ice hockey)|Mark Hunter]] in a deal brokered by George Georgopoulos who was negotiating with the City for a multi-purpose entertainment centre and arena in Downtown London.

The team would leave the Gardens/Ice House after the 2001-02 season and relocate to the newly built John Labatt Centre later renamed to [[Budweiser Gardens]] on the former Talbot Block in Downtown London the following season. The last goal ever scored at the London Ice House was scored in overtime by [[Carlo Colaiacovo]] of the Erie Otters in the 2002 OHL Playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ontariohockeyleague.com/article/western-conference-semi-final-preview_166164&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Rolling Stones]] played the arena on April 26, 1965, but due to rioting in the audience, the show was shut down by police after only 15 minutes. Since the concert, only Bill Wyman (from the 1965 Stones - who is no longer with the band) returned to London and performed at the Harris Park with his band in 2001. Also, one other highlight from the concert was that former NHL player and head coach [[Pat Quinn (ice hockey)|Pat Quinn]] promoted the event and brought the Rolling Stones to London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lfpress.com/2015/04/24/rolling-stones-london-concert-was-cut-short-50-years-ago-sunday&lt;/ref&gt;

Another one of the arena's most famous moments came in February 1968, when singer [[Johnny Cash]] proposed onstage to his longtime partner, [[June Carter Cash]], during a concert at the building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lfpress.com/entertainment/columnists/james_reaney/2010/09/29/15523291.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Ice House's closure it was purchased by investors who turned it into a [[motocross]] facility called the [[London Motoplex]]; however, the investment group were not making payments during their ownership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/LondonFreePress/Sports/2003/10/07/219161.html&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership of the building returned to the Hunter brothers afterward. Most of the old seats and all of the hockey memorabilia was sold at auction. The 1994-era seats were purchased by the [[Windsor Spitfires]] organization, who installed them at the [[Windsor Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buildingstories.co/report.php?ListType=bheritage_data&amp;ID=3227&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004, a group of investors (made up of business, community, and government investment) converted the former hockey arena and motocross track into an indoor cycling track and became the [[Forest City Velodrome]]. The Forest City Velodrome Association (a non-profit organization) operates the races, clinics, and other activities at the track.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestcityvelodrome.ca/track_history.php&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Olympic medal''' is awarded to successful competitors at one of the [[Olympic Games]]. There are three classes of [[medal]]: [[gold medal|gold]], awarded to the winner; [[silver medal|silver]], awarded to the 1st runner-up; and [[bronze medal|bronze]], awarded to the second runner-up.  The granting of [[award]]s is laid out in detail in the Olympic protocols.

Medal designs have varied considerably since the first Olympic Games in 1896, particularly in size and weight.  A standard obverse (front) design of the medals for the [[Summer Olympic Games]] began in 1928 and remained for many years, until its replacement at the 2004 Games as the result of controversy surrounding the use of the [[Rome|Roman]] [[Colosseum]] rather than a building representing the Games' [[Greece|Greek]] roots.  The medals of the [[Winter Olympic Games]] never had a common design, but regularly feature snowflakes and the event where the medal has been won.

In addition to generally supporting their Olympic athletes, some countries provide sums of money and gifts to medal winners, depending on the classes and number of medals won.

Total medals won are used to rank competitor nations in medal tables, these may be compiled for a specific discipline, for a particular Games, or [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|over all time]]. These totals always total event placements rather than actual medals — a victory in a team event (such as [[relay race]]) equates to a single gold for such rankings even though each team member would receive a physical medal.

==Introduction and early history==
The [[olive wreath]] was the prize for the winner at the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. It was an [[olive]] branch, off the [[Olea oleaster|wild-olive tree]] that grew at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Theophrastus]], ''Enquiry into Plants'', IV.13.2: 'the wild-olive [''kotinos''] at Olympia near the temple of zeus, from which the wreaths for the games are made".&lt;/ref&gt; intertwined to form a circle or a horse-shoe. According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] it was introduced by [[Heracles]] as a prize for the winner of the [[Stadion (running race)|running race]] to honour [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+5.7.7&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 5.7.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the modern Olympic Games began in 1896 medals started to be given to successful olympian competitors.  However, [[gold medal]]s were not awarded at the [[1896 Summer Olympics|inaugural Olympics in 1896]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14291544#summer-1928 London 2012: Olympic medals timeline], [[BBC News]].

The custom of the sequence of [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[bronze]] for the first three places dates from the [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in the [[United States]].  The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) has retroactively assigned gold, silver and bronze medals to the three best placed athletes in each event of the 1896 and [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]] Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Athens 1896–Medal Table | publisher = International Olympic Committee | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/table_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1896 | accessdate = 2008-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mallon"&gt;{{cite book | author = Mallon, Bill | year = 1998 | title = The 1900 Olympic Games, Results for All Competitors in All Events, with Commentary | publisher = McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers | location = Jefferson, North Carolina | isbn = 0-7864-0378-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If there is a tie for any of the top three places all competitors are entitled to receive the appropriate medal according to IOC rules.&lt;ref name="rep268"&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_268.pdf Report 268].

Medals are not the only awards given to competitors; every athlete placed first to eighth receives an [[Olympic diploma]].  Also, at the main host stadium, the names of all medal winners are written onto a wall.&lt;ref name="rep268" /&gt;  Finally, as noted below, all athletes receive a participation medal and diploma.

The IOC dictates the physical properties of the medals and has the final decision about the finished design.  Specifications for the medals are developed along with the [[National Olympic Committee]] (NOC) hosting the Games, though the IOC has brought in some set rules:&lt;ref name="rep268" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtVictory"&gt;[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/sydney2000games/files/modules/63BF7DF2-4224-4A35-AF03B3B732AEEAF2/olympic_victory_medals.pdf The fine art of victory], [[Powerhouse Museum]].

*Event details: The sport for which the medal has been awarded should be written on the medal

The first Olympic medals in 1896 were designed by French sculptor [[Jules-Clément Chaplain]] and depicted Zeus holding [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of victory, on the obverse and the [[Acropolis]] on the reverse.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;  They were made by the [[Paris Mint]], which also made the medals for the 1900 Olympic Games, hosted by Paris.  This started the tradition of giving the responsibility of [[Mint (coin)|minting]] the medals to the host city.  For the next few Olympiads the host city also chose the medal design. Until 1912 the gold medals were made of solid gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/olympics-2016-gold-medals/story?id=41318405 |title=Olympics 2016: Everything You Need to Know About Gold Medals |website=ABC News |date=12 August 2016 |author= |accessdate= 14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Trionfo''===
[[File:1980 Summer Olympics bronze medal.JPG|thumb|The [[bronze medal]] from the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] showing Cassioli's obverse design]]

In 1923 the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) launched a competition for sculptors to design the medals for the [[Summer Olympic Games]].  [[Giuseppe Cassioli]]'s ''[[Trionfo]]'' design was chosen as the winner in 1928.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="olympicorg"&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/content/museum/museum-treasures/winners-medals/medal_london_1948/ Winner's medal for the 1948 Olympic Games in London], Olympic.org. Retrieved 5 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aig"&gt;[http://www.athensinfoguide.com/olympicmedalssummer.htm Olympic Summer Games Medals], Athens Info Guide. Retrieved 27 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The obverse brought back Nike but this time as the main focus, holding a winner's crown and palm with a depiction of the [[Colosseum]] in the background.&lt;ref name="olympicorg" /&gt;  In the top right section of the medal a space was left for the name of the Olympic host and the Games numeral.  The reverse features a crowd of people carrying a triumphant athlete.  His winning design was first presented at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]].  The competition saw this design used for 40 years until the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]] became the first Games with a different design for the reverse side of the medal.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

Cassioli's design continued to inspire the obverse of the medal for many more years, though recreated each time, with the Olympic host and numeral updated.  The obverse remained true to the ''Trionfo'' design until the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], where the IOC allowed an updated version to be created.  For the next few events they mandated the use of the Nike motif but allowed other aspects to change.&lt;ref name="ArtVictory" /&gt;  The trend ended in 2004 due to the negative publicity in reaction to the design of medal for the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney]].  [[Wojciech Pietranik]], the designer of the medal, along with the organisers of the Games were criticised by the [[Greece|Greek]] press for using the [[Rome|Roman]] Colosseum rather than the Greek [[Parthenon]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/1367176/Greek-anger-at-Olympic-medal-design.html Greek anger at Olympic medal design], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. Retrieved 5 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pietranik's original design had featured the [[Sydney Opera House]] on the obverse but the IOC concluded that it should be replaced by the Colosseum and a chariot rider.  He made the changes and, despite the criticism, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games decided to continue with the design as it was, noting that there was insufficient time to complete another version and that it would be too costly.&lt;ref name="ArtVictory" /&gt;  The error had remained for 76 years until a new style depicting the [[Panathinaiko Stadium]] was introduced at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="peopledaily"&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200307/02/eng20030702_119258.shtml Athens' New Olympic Medal Design Win IOC's Nod], People Daily. Retrieved 5 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  This new obverse design is currently in use since than.

===Custom reverse designs===
The German Olympic Committee, [[Nationales Olympisches Komitee für Deutschland]], were the first Summer Games organisers to elect to change the reverse of the medal.  The 1972 design was created by [[Gerhard Marcks]], an artist from the [[Bauhaus]], and features mythological twins [[Castor and Pollux]].&lt;ref name="IOCrefdoc"&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Summer_Games_Medals_ENG.pdf Olympic Summer Games Medals From Athens 1896 to Beijing 2008]. International Olympic Committee. April 2010. Retrieved 10 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then the Organising Committee of the host city has been given the freedom of the design of the reverse, with the IOC giving final approval.

===Comparison between Summer and Winter===
The IOC has the final decision on the specifications of each design for all Olympic medals, including the Summer Games, [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Games]], and [[Paralympic Games]].  There has been a greater variety of design for the Winter Games; unlike with the Summer Games, the IOC never mandated one particular design.  The medal at the inaugural [[1924 Winter Olympics]] in [[Chamonix]], [[France]] did not even feature the [[Olympic symbols#Olympic rings|Olympic rings]].  Nike was featured on the medals of the 1932 and 1936 Games but has only appeared on one medal design since then.  One regular motif is the use of the snowflake, while laurel leaves and crowns appear on several designs.  The Olympic motto ''[[Olympic symbols#Motto|Citius, Altius, Fortius]]'' features on four Winter Games medals but does not appear on any Summer Games medal.

For three events in a row, hosts of the Winter Games included different materials in the medals: glass (1992), [[sparagmite]] (1994), and [[lacquer]] (1998).  It was not until the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]] that a Summer Olympic host chose to use something different, in this case [[jade]].  While every Summer Olympic medal except for the 1900 Games has been circular, the shapes of the Winter Games have been considerably more varied.  The Winter Games medals are also generally larger, thicker, and heavier than those for the Summer Games.

==Participation medals==

Since the beginning of the modern Olympics the athletes and their support staffs, event officials, and certain volunteers involved in planning and managing the games have received commemorative medals and diplomas.  Like the winners' medals, these are changed for each Olympiad, with different ones issued for the summer and winter games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic-museum.de/index.html Olympic Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation==
[[File:Thorpe gold medal.jpg|thumb|[[Jim Thorpe]] receives his medal at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]]]]
The presentation of the medals and awards changed significantly until the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] brought in what has now become standard.  Before 1932 all the medals were awarded at the closing ceremony, with the athletes wearing [[white tie|evening dress]] for the first few Games.  Originally the presenting dignitary was stationary while the athletes filed past to receive their medals.  The victory [[podium]] was introduced upon the personal instruction in 1931 of [[Henri de Baillet-Latour]], who had seen one used at the [[1930 British Empire Games]].&lt;ref name="podium1998"&gt;{{cite paper |last=Barney|first=Robert K. |title=A Research Note on the Origins of the Olympic Victory Podium |journal=International Symposium for Olympic Research |volume=Fourth: Global and Cultural Critique: Problematizing the Olympic Games |pages=219–226 |format=PDF |url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/ISOR/ISOR1998x.pdf |year=1998 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner is in the middle at a higher elevation, with the silver medallist to the right and the bronze to the left.&lt;ref name="podium1998"/&gt;  At the [[1932 Winter Olympics]], medals were awarded in the closing ceremony, with athletes for each event in turn mounting the first-ever podium.  At the Summer Olympics, competitors in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|Coliseum]] received their medals immediately after each event for the first time; competitors at other venues came to the Coliseum next day to receive their medals.&lt;ref name="rep268" /&gt;&lt;ref name="podium1998"/&gt; Later Games have had a victory podium at each competition venue.

The [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] were the first in which the medals were placed around the neck of the athletes.  The medals hung from a chain of laurel leaves, while they are now hung from a coloured ribbon.&lt;ref name="IOCrefdoc" /&gt;  When Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics the competitors on the podium also received an olive wreath crown. In the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], each medalist received a wooden statuette of the Olympic logo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-17/rio-2016-what-is-the-figurine-athletes-are-receiving-with-medal/7749814&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Major League Baseball]], a '''player to be named later (PTBNL)''' is an unnamed player involved in exchange or "[[Trade (sports)|trade]]" of players between teams. The terms of a trade are not finalized until a later date, most often following the conclusion of the season.

Postponing a trade's final conditions or terms is often done for several reasons. First, the team receiving the PTBNL might not be certain which position they want to fill, so this type of deal gives them more time to figure it out. Second, this type of arrangement gives the team receiving the PTBNL more time to evaluate the available talent on the other team. Also, when a trade takes place during August, a player must [[waivers (MLB)|clear waivers]] before he can be traded; the PTBNL concept allows the player's original team to make an attempt to have him clear waivers then finalize the deal, or (if the player cannot clear waivers) wait until the end of the season to trade him.

When a PTBNL transaction occurs, the negotiating teams usually agree on a list of five to ten players that the PTBNL will ultimately be chosen from.

The deal must close within six months of the conclusion of the rest of the trade. If the teams can't agree on who the player will be, then they will agree on a price to be paid instead of a player. It is possible that a player could end up being traded for himself, as has happened four times in MLB history.

The PTBNL is generally [[minor league baseball|a minor league player]] or a [[Journeyman (sports)|journeyman]] major leaguer. Very few PTBNLs are of known star quality at the time of trade, however some minor league PTBNLs have gone on to be productive in the majors, including: [[Michael Brantley]], [[Jeremy Bonderman]], [[Scott Podsednik]], [[Coco Crisp]], [[Moisés Alou]], [[Jason Schmidt]], and [[David Ortiz]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Notable PTBNLs==
===Players traded for themselves===
Four players in MLB history were traded for a PTBNL, then subsequently traded back to their original teams, thus being players that were traded for themselves:
*[[Harry Chiti]] was traded to the 1962 [[New York Mets]] from the [[Cleveland Indians]] for a PTBNL. However, the teams could not agree on a final deal, so the Mets traded Chiti back to Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Derfner |first= Jeremy | title=What Is a Player To Be Named Later? | publisher=Slate |date=August 3, 2000 | url=http://www.slate.com/id/1005814/ | accessdate=January 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Brad Gulden]] was traded from the [[New York Yankees]] to the [[Seattle Mariners]] in 1980 for a PTBNL, then in May 1981 Seattle traded him back to the Yankees.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/20TH-ANNIVERSARY-Brad-Gulden-The-orginal-The-2537623.php|title=20TH ANNIVERSARY: Brad Gulden / The original The original Humm-baby / Craig's fond label for scrub caught on|last=Kroner|first=Steve|date=April 9, 2006|accessdate=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1987 [[Dickie Noles]] was traded from the [[Chicago Cubs]] to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for a PTBNL. As with Chiti, the teams could not agree on a final deal, and Noles was traded back to the Cubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OENPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7QIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4574,5584645&amp;dq=himself+dickie+noles+trade&amp;hl=en|title=Tiger-Cub Trade Even!|date=October 24, 1987|work=Toledo Blade|page=16|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On July 22, 2005, [[John McDonald (infielder)|John McDonald]] was traded from the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for a PTBNL. McDonald was subsequently re-acquired by Toronto on November 10, 2005, in a cash transaction completing the trade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2005/YM_2005.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dave Winfield and the 1994 strike===
[[Dave Winfield]], a [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]r, near the end of his career, was included in a PTBNL trade complicated by the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|1994 strike]].

While a member of the [[Minnesota Twins]], Winfield was traded on August 31, 1994 to the Cleveland Indians for a PTBNL. Under the terms and conditions of the trade, if Winfield appeared in 16 or more games with the Indians, the Twins would receive a Class AA-level PTBNL, but if he played between one and 15 games the PTBNL would be Class A-level.

However, the strike led to the season eventually being canceled with no further games played. To settle the trade, Cleveland paid Minnesota a token sum of $100, and the Indians' general manager took the Twins' general manager out to dinner and picked up the dinner tab (official sources list the transaction as Winfield having been sold by the Twins to the Indians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Keegan | first=Tom | title=Owners try on global thinking cap | newspaper=The Baltimore Sun | date=September 11, 1994 | url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-09-11/sports/1994254094_1_global-expansion-salary-cap-orioles/2 | accessdate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the movie ''[[Bull Durham]]'', [[Kevin Costner]]'s character [[Crash Davis]] introduces himself to his new manager as "I'm the player to be named later."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media
 | people = [[Kevin Costner]] ([[Crash Davis]])

 | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094812/quotes
 | medium = Film
 | publisher = [[MGM]]
 | location = USA
 | date = 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other sports==

In the [[National Hockey League]], future considerations work in a similar fashion to PTBNLs, except that, because the NHL allows teams to trade draft picks, but does not allow teams to trade players or draft picks for cash, draft picks can be traded instead of cash.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The event is named after the Vanteaux family, who were among France's first racehorse breeders. The family were based at the [[Saint-Jean-Ligoure]] stud farm in [[Haute-Vienne]]. The farm was initially run by Gabriel de Vanteaux (1779–1854), and then by his son Psalmet de Vanteaux (1822–1893).

The Prix Vanteaux was established in 1868,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 1868 Prix Vanteaux | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5-UNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA322&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U0UeISUSXOwCI7xRae-MMLAJHY11w&amp;ci=515%2C376%2C479%2C188&amp;edge=0 | work = Ruff's Guide to the Turf for 1869 | accessdate = 1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was originally run over 2,000&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1875 Prix Vanteaux | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/proxy?method=R&amp;ark=bpt6k2755458.f3&amp;l=5&amp;r=2930,1024,266,420 | newspaper = [[Le Figaro]] | date = 5 April 1875 | accessdate = 17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was abandoned because of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871. It was cancelled throughout World War&amp;nbsp;I, with no running from 1915 to 1918.

The race was held at [[Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse|Maisons-Laffitte]] in 1944 and 1945. It was shortened to 1,950&amp;nbsp;metres in 1953. During the mid-1960s, it was contested over 1,850&amp;nbsp;metres (1963), 1,950&amp;nbsp;metres (1964) and 1,850&amp;nbsp;metres (1965–67). It was extended to 1,900&amp;nbsp;metres in 1968. 

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Prix Vanteaux was subsequently classed at Group&amp;nbsp;3 level. It was cut to 1,850&amp;nbsp;metres in 1987.

The event sometimes serves as a trial for the [[Prix de Diane]]. The last horse to win both races was Latice in 2004.

'''Reef''' is a brand of casual [[sandals]], known as [[Flip-flops|Thongs]], created by two Argentine brothers, Fernando and Santiago Aguerre. In 1984 they moved from Argentina to the [[San Diego]] beach community of [[La Jolla, California|La Jolla]], [[California]], where they began Reef. Their product became popular amongst surfers and beach goers. Reef has subsequently grown into one of the world's leading active sandal manufacturers.&lt;ref name="fortune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/business/20050405-9999-1b5reef.html|title=Stepping into a fortune|last=McMahon|first=Shannon|date=2005-04-05|publisher=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stadio Olimpico''' is the main and largest sports facility of [[Rome]], Italy. It is located within the [[Foro Italico]] sports complex, north of the city. The structure is an asset of the [[Italian National Olympic Committee]] and it is intended primarily for [[association football|football]]. The '''Stadio Olimpico''' is the home stadium of [[Serie A]] clubs [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] and also hosts the [[Coppa Italia]] final. It was rebuilt for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] and it hosted the [[1990 FIFA World Cup Final|tournament final]].

Rated an [[UEFA stadium categories|UEFA category four]] stadium, it has also hosted four [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] finals, the most recent being the [[2009 UEFA Champions League Final]]. Outside football, the stadium is used by the [[Italy national rugby union team|Italian national]] [[rugby union]] team and it is Italy's national athletics stadium. Occasionally, it hosts concerts and events.

==History==
Throughout its history, the Stadio Olimpico has undergone several renovations.

=== 1937, the Stadio dei Cipressi ===
In its first stages, the Stadio Olimpico was called the '''Stadio dei Cipressi'''. It was designed and constructed within the larger project of the ''Foro [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'' (Mussolini Forum) which was renamed ''Foro Italico'' after the war.

Construction work began in 1927 directed by the Turinese engineer Angelo Frisa and architect Enrico Del Debbio. The construction was completed in 1932, after a few variations to the original plan. For instance, the construction of masonry stands was not part of the initial plan as, originally, stands consisted of grassed terraces.

In 1937, the construction of a second tier of stairs was started but was interrupted in 1940 due to the outbreak of World War II.

=== 1953, the Stadio dei Centomila ===
[[File:Rome, Olympic Stadium, 1950s.jpg|thumbnail|left|Panoramic view of the stadium in the 1950s]]
In December 1950, the working site was reopened for the completion of the stadium. The project was entrusted to the engineer Carlo Roccatelli, a member of the Superior Council of Public Works. At first, the plan was for a stadium with a more complex structure than that actually realised.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} However, the scarcity of funds and the environmental characteristics of the area led to a less ambitious building. On the death of Roccatelli in 1951, the direction of the work was entrusted to architect Annibale Vitellozzi. The stadium now reached a capacity of about 100,000 people, hence the stadium was known as '''Stadio dei Centomila,''' until renamed for the 1960 Olympics. The building was inaugurated on 17 May 1953 with a football game between [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]].

=== 1960, the Stadio Olimpico ===
[[File:Rome Olympics 1960 - Opening Day.jpg|thumbnail|right|Opening Ceremony of the 1960 Olympic Games]]
During the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], the stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies and the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics|athletics]] competitions. Seating at ground level was eliminated with the result of an actual capacity of 65,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1960/OR1960v1.pdf 1960 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1. pp. 56-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the stadium hosted several editions of the Italian Championships of Athletics, the [[1975 Summer Universiade]] (the stadium was the only venue for the Universiade) and the [[1987 World Athletics Championships]]. It still hosts the annual meeting of the [[Golden Gala]].

=== 1990 restructuring and roofing of the stadium ===
[[File:2011 06 22 orl-cia 241 (5869659536).jpg|thumb|left|The Stadio Olimpico from above]]
For the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], for which it was the main stadium, the facility underwent an extensive renovation. While that work was underway in 1989 the Capitoline teams Lazio and Roma had to play their [[Serie A]] games at [[Stadio Flaminio]]. The work was entrusted to a team of designers including the original architect Annibale Vitellozzi. From 1987 to 1990, the construction plan was amended several times, with a consequent rise in costs. Ultimately, the Olimpico was entirely demolished and rebuilt in reinforced concrete, with the exception of the ''Tribuna Tevere'' which was expanded with the addition of further steps and of the [[Curva (stadia)|curves]] which were closer to the field by nine metres. All sectors of the stadium were provided with full coverage in tensostructure white. Backless seats in blue plastic were installed and two giant screens built in 1987 for the World Athletics Championships were also mounted inside the curve. In the end the new version of the Olimpico had 82,911 seats. It was the 14th stadium in the world for number of seats among the football stadiums, the 29th among all stadiums and the second in Italy, just behind the [[San Siro|San Siro Stadium]] of [[Milan]].

The Stadio Olimpico was host to five matches in which the [[Italy national football team|Italian National Team]] took part and the final between [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. West Germany won the final match 1–0.

With the same layout from 1990, the Stadio Olimpico hosted on 22 May 1996 the [[1996 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League Final]] between [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] which saw the ''Bianconeri'' prevail in a penalty shoot-out.

=== 2008 restyling of the stadium ===
[[File:2012-02-11 Rome Olympic Stadium under the snow ITA - ENG rugby.jpg|250px|Exterior of the stadium.|thumb|right]]
[[File:Panoramica dello Stadio Olimpico (Roma).jpg|alt=An internal panoramic view of the Stadio Olimpico, sold-out for the football match between Roma and Genoa, 28 May 2017.|left|thumb|An internal panoramic view of the Stadio Olimpico in May 2017.]]
In 2007, a vast plan of restyling the internal design of the stadium was laid out, to conform to [[UEFA]] standards for the [[2009 UEFA Champions League Final]] which was held in [[Rome]]. The work was performed and completed in 2008. It included the establishment of standard structures with improvements in security, the fixing of dressing rooms and of the press room. It also included the replacement of all seats, the installation of [[High-definition television|high definition]] [[LED-backlit LCD television|LED screens]], the partial removal of plexiglas fences between spectators and the field and a reduction of seating to the current capacity of 70,634. In order to enhance the comfort of the audience, part of the modernisation of the stadium involved increasing the number of restrooms and fixing the toilets. As a result of these improvements, the ''Stadio Olimpico was'' classified a [[UEFA Elite stadium]].
