== The impact event ==
At 11:40:14 local time (16:40:14 GMT) on 15 September 2007, a [[chondrite|chondritic]] [[meteorite]] crashed near the village of Carancas in the [[Puno Region]], [[Peru]], near the [[Bolivia]]n border and [[Lake Titicaca]] (see map box on right).&lt;ref name="PlanetarioMaxSchreier_092407"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rsoe.hu"/&gt; The impact created a crater larger than {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep, {{convert|13|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide, with visibly scorched earth around the impact site.&lt;ref name="Guardian_091807"/&gt; A local official, Marco Limache, said that "boiling water started coming out of the crater, and particles of rock and cinders were found nearby", as "fetid, noxious" gases spewed from the crater.&lt;ref name="MSNBC_091807"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_091807"/&gt;  The crater size was given as {{convert|13.80|by|13.30|m|ft}}, with its greatest dimensions in an east-west direction. The fireball had been observed by the locals as strongly luminous with a smoky tail, and seen from just {{convert|1000|m|ft}} above the ground. The object moved in a direction toward N030E. The small seismic shock of the impact shattered the windows of the local health center {{convert|1|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} away. A smoke column was formed at the site that lasted several minutes, and gas was seen bubbling up in the water in the crater.

One villager was as close as {{convert|100|m|ft}} from the impact site. He fell from his bicycle but was not injured. A small building {{convert|120|m|ft}} from the impact site did not suffer much either besides roof damage from flying debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/SA/Peru/Puno/CarancasImpact.htm|title=Carancas impact crater|publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the impact, over 600 villagers visited the site and some began to fall ill from unexplained causes, including symptoms of [[dermal]] injuries, [[nausea]], [[headaches]], [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]].&lt;ref name="Register_091807"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC-AU_091807"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LIP_091907_0900"/&gt; On 20 September, Peruvian scientists confirmed that there had been a meteorite strike, but no further information on the cause of the illnesses was known.&lt;ref name="AHN_0920075"&gt;Ed Sutherland.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Impact crater]] specialists have called the impact unusual, and have stated that the meteorite was at least {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in diameter before breaking up.&lt;ref&gt;Monty Hayes, Associated Press/Google, [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5isWWHSxCh_u0yUNU9Gpk1qfg996A "Meteorite Likely Caused Crater in Peru"], September 20, 2007.

However, further investigations have led to the conclusion that the arsenic content in the groundwater did not differ from that of the local drinking supply,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and that the illness reported was likely caused by the vaporization of [[troilite]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} a sulfur-bearing compound present within the meteorite in large amounts, which would have melted at relatively low temperatures and high pressures created by such an impact.

According to [[cosmochemistry|cosmochemist]] Larry Grossman of the [[University of Chicago]], the aerial lights and explosions reported were consistent with [[outer space|extraterrestrial]] material.&lt;ref name=Space_091907&gt;Andrea Thompson, Space.com, [http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070919_peru_meteorite.html "Scientists Doubt Meteorite Sickened Peruvians "], 19 September 2007.

On 20 September, the X-Ray Laboratory at the Faculty of Geological Sciences, Mayor de San Andres University, [[La Paz, Bolivia]], published a report of their analysis of a small sample of material recovered from the impact site.  They detected iron, [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], and traces of [[iridium]] &amp;mdash; elements characteristic of the elemental composition of meteorites. The quantitative proportions of [[silicon]], [[aluminium]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[phosphorus]] are incompatible with rocks that are normally found at the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Blanco Cazas, [http://fcpn.umsa.bo/fcpn/app?service=external/PublicationDownload&amp;sp=227 "Informe Laboratorio de Rayos X &amp;mdash; FRX-DRX"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706150400/http://fcpn.umsa.bo/fcpn/app?service=external%2FPublicationDownload&amp;sp=227 |date=2011-07-06 }} (in Spanish), Universidad Mayor de San Andres, Facultad de Ciencias Geologicas, Instituto de Investigaciones Geologicas y del Medio Ambiente, La Paz, Bolivia, September 20, 2007.

INGEMMET (''Instituto Geol√≥gico Minero y Metal√∫rgico'') of Peru released internally on September 21 a report on the Carancas meteorite fall. The release of the document to the public was delayed for one week. The researchers found that the fragments from the crater zone had a chondritic texture and the following mineral composition: [[pyroxene]] (1) 40%, [[olivine]] 20%, [[feldspar]] 10%, [[pyroxene]] (2) 10%; [[kamacite]] 15%, [[troilite]] 5%, and traces of [[chromite]] and [[native copper]]. [[Kamacite]] occurs naturally only in [[meteorites]].

The official classification of the Carancas meteorite, accepted by the [[Meteoritical Society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/index.php?code=45817 Meteoritical Bulletin: Entry for Carancas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was done by a team of scientists working at the [[University of Arizona]].  The meteorite is an [[ordinary chondrite]], an [[H chondrite]] [[breccia]], containing clasts of petrologic types 4 to 5.  The formal classification is H4-5.

The meteoroid had experienced a considerable amount of [[shock (mechanics)|shock]] before its ultimate encounter with Earth.

Further results are expected, and material is also going to be studied by [[NASA]], British and Japanese researchers according to media reports.&lt;ref name=ingemmet1&gt;Luisa Macedo F. &amp; Jos√© Machar√© O., INGEMMET, [http://www.ingemmet.gob.pe/paginas/pl01_quienes_somos.aspx?opcion=320 "The Carancas Meteorite Fall, 15 September 2007"]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 21 September 2007.

Reported details about the event, such as water boiling in the muddy crater for ten minutes from the heat of the impact, presented a problem for experts. Because the impact site is at a high altitude of more than {{convert|3800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the meteoroid may not have been slowed down as much as it ordinarily would have been by passage through the Earth's denser lower atmosphere, and kinetic energy at impact may have been unusually high for a terrestrial impact of an object of this size and mass. Most larger meteorites are cold in their bulk mass when they land on Earth, since their heated outer layers [[Ablation|ablate]] from the objects before impacting.&lt;ref name="APGoogle_092007"/&gt; It was later confirmed that the meteorite contained a large amount of [[iron]] and possessed magnetic properties common to similar metallic objects, which contributed to its capacity to retain heat during [[Atmospheric reentry|atmospheric entry]].&lt;ref name=LIP_092107_1700&gt;Living in Peru, LIP-ir, [http://www.livinginperu.com/news-4758-environmentnature-astrophysicist-peru-identifies-properties-meteorite "Astrophysicist in Peru Identifies Properties in Meteorite"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721020449/http://www.livinginperu.com/news-4758-environmentnature-astrophysicist-peru-identifies-properties-meteorite |date=2011-07-21 }}, September 21, 2007, 17:00.

=== Government response ===
In contrast with other international media reports, Peruvian health officials downplayed the incident.

However, a health brigade arrived with personnel and medication to the site on 18 September, reporting that the odors rising from the crater were causing medical issues.&lt;ref name=LIP_091807_1500&gt;Living in Peru, LIP-ir, [http://www.livinginperu.com/news-4728-health-peru-regional-health-director-reports-health-near-meteorite-crash-site "Regional Health Director Reports on Health Near Meteorite Crash Site"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013182005/http://livinginperu.com/news-4728-health-peru-regional-health-director-reports-health-near-meteorite-crash-site |date=2007-10-13 }}, 18 September 2007, 15:00.

=== Suspected cause ===
Scientists initially ruled out [[radiation]] as the cause of the illness. Renan Ramirez of the Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute stated that the medical conditions could have been caused by [[sulfur]], [[arsenic]] or other toxins that may have melted in the extreme heat produced by the meteorite strike.&lt;ref name=AFP_091807_1&gt;Agence France Presse, [http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/peru-meteor-illness-deepens/2007/09/18/1189881490291.html "Peru meteor illness deepens"], September 18, 2007.

Some reports indicated initial suspicions that the illnesses may have been [[psychosomatic]] in nature.&lt;ref name="APGoogle_092007"/&gt; Don Yeomans, head of the [[Near Earth Object]] Program at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[Pasadena, California]], said, "Statistically, it's far more likely to have come from below than from above. The noxious fumes that have supposedly sickened curious locals who went to examine the crater would seem to indicate [[hydrothermal]] activity, such as a local gas explosion, because meteorites don't give off odors."

By 21 September, it was believed that the illness was caused by [[arsenic poisoning]]. Luisa Macedo of Peru's Mining, Metallurgy, and Geology Institute said gases were created when the meteorite's hot surface reacted with an underground water supply tainted with arsenic. Natural arsenic deposits in ground water are not uncommon in southern Peru. Jos√© Ishitsuka of the Peruvian Geophysics Institute said, "If the meteorite arrives incandescent and at a high temperature because of [[ram pressure]], hitting water can create a column of steam."Meteorites, however, often impact the earth at low temperatures, making this an unusual event.

'''AGILE''' ('''A'''stro‚ÄêRivelatore '''G'''amma a '''I'''mmagini '''Le'''ggero) is an [[X-ray]] and [[Gamma ray]] astronomical satellite of the [[Italian Space Agency]] (ASI).

==Objectives==
AGILE's mission is to observe [[gamma-ray]] sources in the universe. Key scientific objectives of the AGILE Mission include the study of:&lt;ref name=asi_agile&gt;[http://www.asi.it/en/activity/high_energy/agile ASI AGILE]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Active galactic nucleus|Active Galactic Nuclei]]
* [[Gamma ray bursts|Gamma-Ray Bursts]]
* X-ray and gamma galactic sources
* Non-identified gamma sources
* Diffuse galactic gamma emissions
* Diffuse extra-galactic gamma emissions
* Fundamental physics

==Instrumentation==
AGILE's instrumentation includes a Gamma Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) sensitive in the 30&amp;nbsp;MeV - 50&amp;nbsp;GeV energy range, a SuperAGILE (SA) hard X-ray monitor sensitive in the 18‚Äì60&amp;nbsp;keV energy range, a Mini-Calorimeter (MCAL) non-imaging gamma-ray scintillation detector sensitive in the 350&amp;nbsp;keV - 100&amp;nbsp;MeV energy range,&lt;ref name=Agile_Scientific_Goals_and_Instrument_Performance&gt;[http://people.roma2.infn.it/~agile/Agile_SpacePart03.pdf Scientific Goals and Instrument Performance of the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector AGILE]&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[electronic anticoincidence|Anti-coincidence]] System (AC), based on a plastic [[scintillator]], to assist with suppressing unwanted background events.

The SuperAGILE SA is an instrument based on a set of four silicon strip detectors, each equipped with one-dimensional coded mask. The SA is designed to detect [[X-Ray]] signals from known sources and burst-like signals. It provides long-term monitoring of flux and spectral features. MCAL can also effectively detect high-energy radiation bursts in its energy band.

==Launch and operations==
AGILE was successfully launched on 23 April 2007, from the Indian base of Sriharikota and was inserted in an equatorial orbit with low particle background. On 23 April 2007, ASI made contact with AGILE; its signals were acquired by the ground station at the [[Broglio Space Centre]] near [[Malindi, Kenya]] and it was placed in a Sun-pointing mode.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/04/25/stories/2007042501891500.htm |title=It will be Israeli satellite in August |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |location=Chennai, India |date=25 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427030956/http://www.hindu.com/2007/04/25/stories/2007042501891500.htm |archivedate=27 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Some transient events detected by AGILE are associated with positions not consistent with a known source (Gamma Ray Burst) and have cosmological origins. Others are due to [[solar flares]], while some are due to Earth atmosphere events (Terrestrial Gamma Flash).

'''Armenian bole''', also known as '''bolus armenus''' or '''bole armoniac''', is an earthy [[clay]], usually red, native to [[Armenia]]. It is red due to the presence of [[iron oxide]]; the clay also contains hydrous [[silicate]]s of [[aluminum]] and possibly [[magnesium]].

==Uses==
Historically, it was used as an [[astringent]], prescribed against [[diarrhea]], [[dysentery]], [[hemorrhage]], etc. Externally, it was used in strengthening plasters, against dislocations of the joints. Physicians sometimes also called it ''Rubrica Synopica'', from the city of [[Sinop, Turkey|Synope]], where it is supposed to be found.

In the nineteenth century, it was incorporated into non-soluble [[tooth powder]]. These types of powders would get stuck between the gums and the teeth and leave an unsightly discoloration. As a result, they were coloured red using Armenian bole to disguise the buildup around the teeth.&lt;ref&gt;Martha E. Foulk and Elizabeth Pickering, "A History of Dentrifices," Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association, 24 no. 11 (1935), 975.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used in [[bookbinding]] for coloring, or applied to the edges during [[gilding]], as a base for the gold leaf and to give the binding a greater depth and luster. In pottery, it is used as a red pigment for the [[ƒ∞znik pottery]] of Turkey. Finally, it has also been used in the waterproofing of [[windmill]] sails. A popular mixture was: 10 liters of water, combined with 0.75 liter linseed oil, 0.75 liter grease, and 1&amp;nbsp;kg of bolus.&lt;ref&gt;Werken met molens by Werkgroep West-Vlaamse Molens v.z.w.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heimolen.be/constructie.html Bolus used for windmill sail]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ascension Island Location2.jpg|thumb]]

The '''Ascension scrub and grasslands''' [[ecoregion]] covers the dormant volcano, [[Ascension Island]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. As well as shrubs and grasses wildlife on the island includes a range of unique flora and fauna. In particular the surrounding islets are important havens for many seabirds, although the seabird populations on Ascension island itself have been severely affected by [[introduced species]], particularly cats.

==Location and description==
Ascension Island lies in the Atlantic near the equator, 1700&amp;nbsp;km off the coast of [[Africa]]. The island still bears relics of its volcanic history including lava fields and cinder. Ascension is 97&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a population of approximately 900. The residents are mainly employees and their families, often on short term contracts with the Ascension Island Government, the military (Royal Air Force and United States Air Force) and commercial operations. The majority of food and other goods are imported from the UK and South Africa. The Royal Mail Ship brings in supplies from St Helena on a regular basis. The USAF air service provides links with Florida and Antigua. The UK Ministry of Defence air service provides links with the Falkland Islands and the UK.

==Flora==
There were never many trees on the island, which is covered by either desert or grass and shrub including some endemic: ''[[Euphorbia origanoides]]'', ''[[Marattia purpurascens]]'', ''[[Asplenium ascensionis]]'', ''[[Xiphopteris ascensionense]]'', ''[[Pteris adscensionis]]'', ''[[Sporobolus caespitosus]]'' and ''[[Anogramma ascensionis]]''.

Most of the vegetation on Ascension Island today has been introduced by humans. Some of these species have spread dramatically and now occur throughout the Island. Approximately 25 species of plant are native and ten of these are considered to be endemic (unique) to Ascension. None of the remaining endemic species are common and their ranges have been reduced due to their inability to compete with the introduced species. The Ascension Island Conservation Department are working in collaboration with the Royal Botanic Garden, Kew on an OTEP (Overseas Territories Environmental Programme) funded Endemic Plants project. Experts from the UK Overseas Territories Team at Kew advise on propagation techniques, ex-situ cultivation and the re-introduction of endangered species. Horticultural protocols for each species are to be outlined, these will be used to improve local collections and further develop ex-situ plant collections. The protocols require a lot of trial and error work to identify the most successful propagation methods for the endemic plants. Stedson Stroud has already successfully cultivated in large numbers three of the endemic species, ''Pteris adscensionis'', ''Euphorbia origanoides'' and ''Sporobolus caespitosus''. The clearing of invasive species on Green Mountain has created a restoration site for the reintroduction of endemic species on the mountain. The project work focuses on increasing the number of endemic species growing in cultivation and introducing these into the restoration areas.   

'''Spurge (''Euphorbia origanoides'')'''
This is the only endemic lowland plant in Ascension. It suffers from encroaching invasive vegetation as well as feeding by introduced animals. Rats seek it for moisture in its stems and roots, and insect pests also cause concern. The species is now limited to the most remote desert areas of the Island.

==Fauna==
Ascension Island is one of the most important warm-water seabird breeding sites in the tropical Atlantic. It supports over 400,000 seabirds of 11 species. The present size of the seabird populations are only a fraction of those found before the colonisation by man in 1815 and the subsequent introduction of feral cats to the Island. The Ascension Island Conservation Department, in partnership with the RSPB began a Seabird Restoration Project in 2001. The project was implemented by the Ascension Island Government, and assisted by the RSPB with funding from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Feral cats were eradicated from the Island, allowing the seabirds to return to nest on the mainland. The last known feral cat was found in February 2004, since then a feral cat monitoring programme has been taking place. Since the eradication of the feral cats the nesting success rate has improved and there are more birds in an increasing number of locations. 

Today the main breeding site is on nearby rat-free Boatswain Bird Island. Over 10,000 birds breed on this tiny island, which is home to [[fairy tern]] (''Gygis alba''), [[Ascension frigatebird]]s,  [[masked booby]], [[brown booby]], [[red-footed booby]], [[red-billed tropicbird]] and [[white-tailed tropicbird]]s (known as boatswain birds), and petrels. The [[sooty tern]], known locally as the wideawake tern because of its distinctive call, is the most common breeding seabird on the main island, and the airport is named after it. The [[Ascension rail]] is extinct.

'''Ascension frigatebird (''Fregata aquilana'')'''
Of the many seabird colonising Ascension's shores, the endemic frigatebird is the most impressive. Due to predation by cats these birds are now found on Boatswainbird Island, but as feral cats have been eradicated from Ascension, it is hoped they will soon follow the other seabirds back to the main Island.

'''Giant pseudoscorpion (''Garypus giganteus'')'''
Ascension is home to a remarkable pseudoscorpion fauna. The most impressive of these tailless scorpion-like creatures is the giant pseudoscorpion, largest of its kind. Predation by rodents and invertebrates on the mainland has limited its distribution to the very isolated Boatswainbird Island, where it lives alongside the endemic frigatebird.

'''Green turtles (''Chelonia mydas'')'''
Ascension holds the second largest breeding site for the green turtle in the Atlantic. This species is dependent on sandy beaches to lay their eggs, and the beaches require regular clearing of invasive plants. Apart from the native landcrabs and endemic frigates, the hatchlings are now taken by mynas.

==Threats==
Since its discovery in 1501 a number of plants and animals have been introduced by settlers on the island, there are no native mammals to the islands and several of the introduced species have gone [[feral]]. Cats in particular have been a threat to the seabird populations and steps are now being taken to reduce the populations of both cats and rats in order to encourage the return of breeding seabirds. Meanwhile, the Mexican thorn bush (''Prosopis juliflora''), another introduced species, has become a serious impediment to the breeding turtles, who lay their eggs on the beaches, and housing development on the island threatens many habitats.

'''Invasive species'''

'''Mexican thorn (''Prosopis juliflora'')'''
This shrub was introduced to stabilise land near new buildings in Two Boats village during the 1960s. It now forms a thick shrubland in drier parts of the Island. It has completely replaced the native vegetation in these areas and threatens bird grounds as well as turtle laying beaches.

'''Guava (''Psidium guajava'')'''
Guava is best known as a refreshing fruit, however, unfortunately on Ascension the fruit it not harvested due to its acidity. Guava causes significant problems in fragile environments such as Ascension Island. This species is one of the first shrubs to cover over sparsely vegetated areas. It can tolerate both hot desert areas as well as cool moist mountain air, and forms thickets that compete with native plants for water and light.

'''Koster's curse (''Clidemia hirta'')'''
This is one of the species that now occurs where a carpet of native and endemic ferns used to grow on Green Mountain. Along with many other introduced species it is capable of growing even in the last rocks which have so far acted as fern sanctuaries.

'''Common myna (''Acridotheres tristis'')'''
Myna birds were introduced as a way of tackling parasites on cattle, now absent from Ascension. They are opportunistic feeders and now feed on sooty tern eggs, turtle eggs and fruits of invasive species, acting as a dispersal agent. They are also noisy and clever pests in gardens, eating fruit and vegetables.

'''Black rat (''Rattus rattus'')'''
The black rat arrived to Ascension early in the Island's history and they are still the only species of rat here. They abound in all parts of the Island, feeding on endemic as well as introduced plants, preying on small animals and competing with land crabs.

'''Threatened habitat - mountain vegetation'''
The Green Mountain summit was once covered in a carpet of ferns with many endemic plants. Hardly any of this carpet now exists due to intensive efforts to increase vegetation in the mountain. Few small rocks still hold a number of endemic species, but even these areas are quickly being overwhelmed by invasive plants. Grazing animals also contribute to loss of native plants.

'''BRICSat-P''' or '''OSCAR 83''' previously known as '''PSat-B''', is a [[U.S.]] [[technology demonstration]] [[satellite]] and an [[amateur radio satellite]] for Packet Radio. BRICSat-P ('''Ballistic Reinforced Communication Satellite''') is a low cost 1.5U CubeSat built by the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] Satellite Lab in collaboration with [[George Washington University]], that will demonstrate on-orbit operation of a '''Micro-[[Cathode]] [[Electric arc|Arc]] Thruster''' (¬µCAT) [[electric propulsion]] system and carries an amateur communication payload.

==Mission==
A four ¬µCAT thruster head system was placed on one side of the spacecraft around the [[center of gravity]] and will de-tumble the satellite from its initial expulsion, demonstrate rotational control about 2 axes, and perform a [[delta-V]] end of life scenario. Orbital analyses performed indicate that the four thruster-head system is able to fit in a '''1.5U Cubesat''' with low power consumption such that other subsystems such as communication systems can perform normally. Dynamics analysis has been performed in MATLAB Simulink and STK that shows the thrusters can successfully perform the attitude control maneuvers. The project is fully funded and scheduled to launch in March 2015.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;

==Frequencies==
BRICSat has 2 amateur communication payload on boards: [[Automatic Packet Reporting System|APRS]] constellation [[transponder]] with downlink on 437.975 [[MHz]] and with uplink on 145.825 [[MHz]] 1k2 and 9k6 AX25 PSK31 transponder with a 28.120 MHz uplink (2.5 [[kHz]] [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) and a [[UHF]] FM downlink.&lt;ref name="Brno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aprs.org/PSK31/Brno-PSK31_2-PID2722925.pdf|title= Communication and Data Handling System for BRICsat Satellite|publisher=Tom√°≈° Urbanec, Petr V√°gner, Miroslav Kasal, Ond≈ôej Baran ([[Brno University of Technology]])|accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bog iron''' is a form of impure [[iron]] deposit that develops in [[bog]]s or [[swamp]]s by the [[chemical]] or [[biochemical]] [[oxidation]] of iron carried in solution. In general, bog ores consist primarily of iron [[oxyhydroxide]]s, commonly [[goethite]] (FeO(OH)).

Iron-bearing groundwater typically emerges as a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]. The iron is oxidized to [[ferric hydroxide]] upon encountering the oxidizing environment of the surface.  Bog ore often combines [[goethite]], [[magnetite]], and [[vug]]s or stained [[quartz]].  Oxidation may occur through [[enzyme catalysis]] by [[iron bacteria]].  It is not clear whether the magnetite precipitates upon first contact with oxygen, then oxidizes to ferric compounds, or whether the ferric compounds are reduced when exposed to anoxic conditions upon burial beneath the sediment surface and reoxidized upon exhumation at the surface.

Iron made from bog ore will often contain residual [[silicate]]s, which can form a glassy coating that imparts some resistance to [[rust]]ing.
[[Image:Iron bearing water in a spring.jpg|thumb|Typical iron-bearing ground water emerging as a spring. The iron is oxidized to ferric hydroxide upon encountering the oxidizing environment of the surface. A large number of these springs and seeps on the flood plain provide the iron for bog iron deposits.]]

==Europe and the North==
Iron [[smelting]] from bog iron was invented during the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]], and most [[Viking era]] iron was smelted from bog iron. The bog iron deposits of Northern and Northeastern Europe were created after the [[Weichselian Ice Age|Ice Age]] ended, on postglacial plains. The dominant source of iron ore in Scandinavia and Russia into the Middle Ages was bog-ore. Even after improved smelting technology made mined ores viable during the Middle Ages, bog ore remained important, particularly to peasant iron production, into modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Sj√∂berg and Anton Tomilov, ‚ÄúIron-Making in Peasant Communities,‚Äù in Iron-making Societies: Early Industrial Development in Sweden and Russia, 1600‚Äì1900, ed. Maria √Ögren, 33‚Äì60 (New York: Berghahn, 1998), 33‚Äì36, 59‚Äì60; Anders Flor√©n, G√∂ran Ryd√©n, Ludmila Dashkevich, D. V. Gavrilov and Sergei Ustiantsev, ‚Äú'The Social Organisation of Work at Mines, Furnaces and Forges,‚Äù in Iron-making Societies: Early Industrial Development in Sweden and Russia, 1600‚Äì1900, ed. Maria √Ögren, 61‚Äì138 (New York: Berghahn, 1998), 62‚Äì65.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Russia]], bog ore was the principal source of iron until the 16th century, when the superior ores of the [[Ural Mountains]] became available.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Streams carry dissolved iron from nearby mountains. In the bog, the iron is concentrated by two processes. The bog environment is acidic, with a low concentration of dissolved oxygen. In the acidic environment of the bog, a chemical reaction forms insoluble iron compounds which precipitate out. But more importantly, [[anaerobic bacteria]] (''Gallionella'' and ''[[Leptothrix (bacterium)|Leptothrix]]'') growing under the surface of the bog concentrate the iron as part of their life processes...Their presence can be detected on the surface by the iridescent oily film they leave on the water ... another sure sign of bog iron. In Iceland, the film is called jarnbr√°k (iron slick). When a layer of peat in the bog is cut and pulled back using turf knives, pea sized nodules of bog iron can be found and harvested. Although the iron nodules are reasonably pure, there aren't many of them. They are, however, a renewable resource. About once each generation, the same bog can be re-harvested."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/text/bog_iron.htm|title=Iron Production in the Viking Age|website=Hurstwic|publisher=William R. Short|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==North America==

===Pre-Columbian===
Iron may have been produced by Vikings at [[L‚ÄôAnse aux Meadows]], [[Point Rosee]] and other locations in [[Newfoundland]] around 1000 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/160331-viking-discovery-north-america-canada-archaeology/|title=Discovery Could Rewrite History of Vikings in New World|last=Strauss|first=Mark|date=31 March 2016|website=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic Partners, LLC.|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sentinelsource.com/news/wapo/an-ancient-site-spotted-from-space-could-rewrite-the-history/article_481a0be0-56ad-5ac1-b82c-973b6e16cfbb.html|title=An ancient site spotted from space could rewrite the history of Vikings in North America|last=Kaplan|first=Sarah|date=2 April 2016|website=SentinelSource.com|publisher=SentinelSource.com, Keene, NH|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial North America===
Bog iron was widely sought in [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial North America]]. The earliest known iron mines in North America are the mines from [[St. John's, Newfoundland]], reported to be in operation by Anthony Parkhurst in 1578.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=LETTER FROM ANTHONY PARKHURST TO RICHARD HAKLUYT, Lawyer, 1578 | url=http://collections.mun.ca/PDFs/cns/TheOriginalWritingsandCorrespondence.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mining efforts in Virginia occurred as early as 1608. In 1619 [[Falling Creek Ironworks]] was established in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]]. It was the location of the first [[blast furnace]] facility in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatch|first=Charles E., Jr.|last2=Gregory|first2=Thurlow Gates|date=July 1962|title=The First American Blast Furnace, 1619-1622: The Birth of a Mighty Industry on Falling Creek in Virginia|journal=The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography|publisher=Virginia Historical Society|volume=70|issue=3|pages=259‚Äì296|jstor=4246864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/autumn07/iron.cfm|title=The Works at Falling Creek|last=Geist|first=Christopher|website=Colonial Williamsburg|publisher=The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lake Massapoag]] in [[Massachusetts]] was drawn down by deepening the outlet channel in a search for bog iron.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Muir, ''Reflections in Bullough's Pond'', University Press of New England, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site]], on the [[Saugus River]] in [[Saugus, Massachusetts]], operated between 1646 and 1668.  The site contains a museum and several reconstructed buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/sair/index.htm|title=Saugus Iron Works|website=National Park Service|publisher=National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the Saugus Iron Works, and the rapid depletion of the region's natural bog iron, led the owners to send prospectors into the surrounding countryside. In 1658 the company bought {{convert|1600|acre|km2}} of land which covered areas that are now Concord, Acton, and Sudbury. They set up a large production facility in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], along the Assabet River with dams, ponds, watercourses, and hearths, but by 1694 the natural bog iron there had also been exhausted, and the land was sold for farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concordma.com/magazine/maraprmay02/ironworks.html |title=The Concord Iron Works |first=Marian H. |last=Wheeler |accessdate=8 March 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022160407/http://www.concordma.com/magazine/maraprmay02/ironworks.html |archivedate=2010-10-22 |df= }} The Concord Iron Works&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Howell Works|Central]] and [[Batsto Village, New Jersey|Southern]] [[New Jersey]], bog ore was mined and refined for the production of naturally rust-resistant tools and [[wrought iron]] rails, many of which still grace staircases in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/pinelands/infor/fact/Early%20Settlers%20Made%20Iron%20Here.pdf|title=Early Settlers Made Iron Here|publisher=New Jersey Pinelands Commission|author=Barry Brady|date=|accessdate=24 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Revolution]], bog iron [[cannonball|cannonballs]] were cast for the colonial forces.

Bog iron was also found on the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland]]. The remains of a commercial smelting operation near [[Snow Hill, Maryland]], are now a state and national historic site.  Known as [[Furnace Town Living Heritage Museum|Furnace Town]], it was called the [[Nassawango Iron Furnace Site|Nassawango Iron Furnace]] after the nearby creek. The commercial furnace ran from about 1825 to 1850.

'''Chief Mountain''' (''[[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot:]] '''Ninaistako''''') ({{convert|9085|ft}}) is located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Montana]] on the eastern border of [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] and the [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation]].&lt;ref name=topo&gt;{{Cite map|publisher=TopoQwest (United States Geological Survey Maps)|title=Chief Mountain, MT|url=https://www.topoquest.com/map.php?lat=48.93276&amp;lon=-113.60927&amp;datum=nad83&amp;zoom=4|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ninaistako&gt;{{cite web |title=Ninaistako (Chief Mountain) |url=https://www.nps.gov/glac/learn/nature/upload/Chief%20Mtn.pdf |website=Crown of the Continent Research Learning Center |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=June 4, 2018 |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain is one of the most prominent peaks and [[Rock formations in the United States|rock formations]] along the [[Rocky Mountain Front]], a {{convert|200|mi|km|-1|abbr=on}} long [[overthrust]] fault, known as the [[Lewis Overthrust]], which extends from central Montana into southern [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].

==The peak==
The peak is easily seen from Montana and Alberta due to the rapid {{convert|5000|ft|m|adj=on}} altitude gain over the [[Great Plains]] which are immediately east of the mountain. 

Chief Mountain is an example of a [[klippe]]. It consists of a [[Precambrian]] block which rests directly above much younger [[Cretaceous]] gray [[shale]]s. The 600&amp;nbsp;million year old Precambrian rocks are 400-500&amp;nbsp;million years older than the Cretaceous rocks at the base of the mountain.&lt;ref name=ninaistako/&gt;

Having an older layer of rock juxtaposed atop younger basement rocks is found on occasion in [[thrust fault]]s and is commonplace along the [[Lewis Overthrust]] which extends from central Montana to far southern Alberta. The surrounding portion of the thrust sheet has been removed by erosion leaving behind this and a few other isolated blocks of [[Proterozoic]] rock.&lt;ref name=ninaistako/&gt;

==Various names==

Chief Mountain has been a sacred mountain to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes for hundreds of years. The Blackfoot name for the mountain is N√≠naiist√°ko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frantz|first=Donald G.|title=Blackfoot Dictionary of Stems, Roots, and Affixes|year=1995|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-7136-1|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ninaistako/&gt; The mountain was seen by white explorers in the late 18th century and was known as "Kings Peak" on maps produced in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1795.  The name was changed in the late 19th century in reflection of [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfeet]] naming of the mountain which was "Great Chief". When Glacier National Park was created in 1910, the summit and most prominent eastern slopes of the mountain were located within the park, leaving only the lower slopes within Blackfeet jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=ninaistako/&gt; 

Chief Mountain remains sacred to many [[First Nations]] peoples from both the U.S. and Canada. Natives from all over North America travel to the base of the mountain for sweet grass ceremonies, placing of prayer flags and other religious rites. In the early 1900s as white settlers came to the area, they observed native burial sites scattered along the base of the mountain. Elders from Southern Alberta's Siksika Band (where the Great Chief Crowfoot hailed from) and other First Nation groups have an oral tradition that near the end of days, a ''Great White God'' would appear from the top of Chief Mountain and upon his departure, the mountain would crumble and be destroyed.&lt;ref name=ninaistako/&gt;

==Climbing==
The eastern face of the mountain rises over {{convert|1500|ft|m|abbr=on}} vertically and the easiest route on this section is rated [[Grade (climbing)#Yosemite Decimal System|class]] 4 by mountaineers. The rock is also primarily [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and provides poor anchor points, which in turn is a contributing factor to the difficulty rating. [[Henry Stimson]] and two other explorers, including a Blackfeet Indian, climbed the difficult eastern face on September 8, 1892, and this is the first known ascent of the peak by white explorers. Upon the summit, Stimson's party observed ceremonial remains including [[bison]] skulls that had been left behind by Native Americans. The eastern face of the peak was not successfully climbed again until 1951. Though the summit can be gained by approaching from the west, the easiest access is from the east, and the Blackfeet tribe may issue access permits to cross reservation lands. This entire area is sacred to the Blackfeet Native Americans.&lt;ref name=ninaistako/&gt; [[National Park Service]] visitor centers at [[St. Mary, Montana]] and at [[Many Glacier]] have additional information available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27565">Claims of the existence of '''other moons of Earth'''‚Äîthat is, of one or more [[natural satellite]]s other than the [[Moon]] that [[orbit]] [[Earth]]‚Äîhave existed for some time. Several candidates have been proposed, but none has been confirmed.&lt;ref name=klotz/&gt; Since the 19th century, scientists have made genuine searches for more moons, but the possibility has also been the subject of a number of dubious non-scientific speculations as well as a number of likely [[hoax]]es.&lt;ref name="Drye-wordpress-dubious"&gt;{{cite web |last=Drye |first=Paul |url=http://passingstrangeness.wordpress.com/2009/01/24/earths-other-moon/ |title=Earth's Other Moon |publisher=passingstrangeness.wordpress.com |date=2009-01-24 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, there are a number of [[near-Earth object]]s (NEOs) with orbits that are in [[Orbital resonance|resonance]] with Earth. These have been called, inaccurately but provocatively, "second", "third" or "other" moons of Earth.&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{citation |last=Lloyd |first=Robin |publisher=space.com |url=http://utstaging.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/second_moon_991029.html |title=More Moons Around Earth? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121208143923/http://utstaging.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/second_moon_991029.html |archivedate=2012-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{mpl|2016 HO|3}}, an [[asteroid]] discovered on 27 April 2016, is possibly the most stable [[quasi-satellite]] of [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20160615"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Agle |first1=DC |last2=Brown |first2=Dwayne |last3=Cantillo |first3=Laurie |title=Small Asteroid Is Earth's Constant Companion |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6537 |date=15 June 2016 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=15 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As it orbits the Sun, {{mp|2016 HO|3}} appears to circle around [[Earth]] as well. It is too distant to be a true [[natural satellite|satellite]] of Earth, but is the best and most stable example of a quasi-satellite, a type of [[near-Earth object]]. They appear to orbit a point other than Earth itself, such as the orbital path of the NEO [[asteroid]] [[3753 Cruithne]]. [[Earth trojan]]s, such as {{mpl|2010 TK|7}}, are NEOs that orbit the Sun (not Earth) on the same orbital path as Earth, and appear to lead or follow Earth along the same orbital path.

Other [[Small Solar System body|small natural objects in orbit around the Sun]] may enter orbit around Earth for a short amount of time, becoming temporary natural satellites. {{As of|2014|alt=To date}}, the only confirmed example has been {{mpl|2006 RH|120}} in Earth orbit during 2006 and 2007, though further instances are already predicted.&lt;ref name=klotz/&gt;

== History ==
=== Petit's moon ===
The first major claim of another moon of Earth was made by French astronomer [[Fr√©d√©ric Petit (astronomer)|Fr√©d√©ric Petit]], director of the [[Toulouse Observatory]], who in 1846 announced that he had discovered a second moon in an [[elliptical orbit]] around Earth.

It was claimed to have also been reported by Lebon and Dassier at [[Toulouse]], and by Larivi√®re at Artenac Observatory, during the early evening of March 21, 1846.&lt;ref name="Schlyter" /&gt;

Petit proposed that this second moon had an elliptical orbit, a period of 2 hours 44 minutes, with {{convert|3570|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[apsis|apogee]] and {{convert|11.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[apsis|perigee]].&lt;ref name="Schlyter" /&gt; This claim was soon dismissed by his peers.&lt;ref name="wandering" /&gt; The {{convert|11.4|km|ft|abbr=on}} perigee is similar to the [[altitude#Altitude in aviation and in spaceflight|cruising altitude]] of most modern airliners, and within Earth's atmosphere. Petit published another paper on his 1846 observations in 1861, basing the second moon's existence on perturbations in movements of the actual Moon.&lt;ref name="Schlyter" /&gt; This second moon hypothesis was not confirmed either.

Petit's proposed moon became a plot point in [[Jules Verne]]'s 1870 science fiction novel ''[[Around the Moon]]''.{{r|ley195707}}

=== Waltemath's moons ===
In 1898 [[Hamburg]] scientist Dr. [[Georg Waltemath]] announced that he had located a system of tiny moons orbiting Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Bakich, Michael E. ''The Cambridge Planetary Handbook''. Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 146, {{ISBN|0-521-63280-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5vM8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA146 see]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Observatoire de Lyon. ''Bulletin de l'Observatoire de Lyon''. Published in France, 1929, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; He had begun his search for secondary moons based on the hypothesis that something was gravitationally affecting the Moon's orbit.&lt;ref name="PO"&gt;Public Opinion: A Comprehensive Summary of the Press Throughout the World on All Important Current Topics, published by Public Opinion Co., 1898: "The Alleged Discovery of a Second Moon", p 369. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y94aAAAAYAAJ Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

Waltemath described one of the proposed moons as being {{convert|1030000|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Earth, with a diameter of {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}}, a 119-day [[orbital period]], and a 177-day [[synodic period]].&lt;ref name="Schlyter" /&gt; He also said it did not reflect enough sunlight to be observed without a telescope, unless viewed at certain times, and made several predictions of its next appearances.&lt;ref name="PO" /&gt; "Sometimes, it shines at night like the sun but only for an hour or so."&lt;ref name="PO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cambridge1"&gt;Bakich, Michael E. ''The Cambridge Planetary Handbook.'' Cambridge University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-521-63280-3}}, p. 148; [https://books.google.com/books?id=5vM8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA148 see]&lt;/ref&gt;

E. Stone Wiggins, a Canadian weather expert, ascribed the cold spring of 1907 to the effect of a second moon, which he said he had first seen in 1882 and had publicized the find in 1884 in the New York Tribune when he put it forward as probable cause of an anomalous solar eclipse of May of that year. He said it was also probably the "green crescent moon" seen in New Zealand and later in North America in 1886, for periods of less than a half-hour each time. He said this was the "second moon" seen by  Waltemath in 1898. Wiggins hypothesized that the second moon had a high carbon atmosphere but could be seen occasionally by its reflected light.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonton Bulletin, June 12, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of these objects put forward by Waltemath (and Wiggins) was discredited after the absence of corroborating observation by other members of the [[scientific community]]. Especially problematic was a failed prediction that they would be seen in February 1898.&lt;ref name="Schlyter" /&gt;

The August 1898 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' mentioned that Waltemath had sent the journal "an announcement of a third moon", which he termed a ''wahrhafter Wetter und Magnet Mond'' ("real weather and magnet moon").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85054468/1898-08-07/ed-1/seq-15/|title=A Stray Moon|date=7 August 1898|work=[[Washington Times-Herald|The Times]]|page=15|accessdate=25 August 2013|location=Washington, D.C.|quote=It is a real weather and magnet moon, and whenever it is about to cross the earth's course it disturbs the atmosphere and surface of the earth, producing storms, rain, tempests, magnetic deviations and earthquakes...}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was supposedly {{convert|746|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, and closer than the "second moon" that he had seen previously.&lt;ref name="science1898"&gt;{{cite journal|date=12 August 1898|title=Science|volume=VIII|issue=189|page=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WX0CAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA185 |accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other claims ===
In 1918, [[astrologer]] Walter Gornold, also known as ''[[Sepharial]]'', claimed to have confirmed the existence of Waltemath's moon. He named it [[Lilith (hypothetical moon)|Lilith]]. Sepharial claimed that Lilith was a 'dark' moon invisible for most of the time, but he claimed to be the first person in history to view it as it crossed the Sun.&lt;ref name="sepharial"&gt;Sepharial, A. ''The Science of Foreknowledge: Being a Compendium of Astrological Research, Philosophy, and Practice in the East and West.''; Kessinger Publishing (reprint), 1997, pp. 39‚Äì50; {{ISBN|1-56459-717-2}} , [https://books.google.com/books?id=hLZBnTAC9uwC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Lilith+astrology&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U2QYJZO-0JQ3TcKOVvH23r00G0vZQ#PPA50,M1 see]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 the science journal ''Die Sterne'' published the findings of amateur German astronomer W. Spill, who claimed to have successfully viewed a second moon orbiting Earth.&lt;ref name="cambridge1" /&gt;

In the late 1960s John Bargby claimed to have observed over ten small natural satellites of Earth, but this was not confirmed.&lt;ref name="Schlyter" /&gt;

=== General surveys ===
[[William Henry Pickering]] (1858‚Äì1938) studied the possibility of a second moon and made a general search ruling out the possibility of many types of objects by 1903.&lt;ref&gt;"On a photographic search for a satellite of the Moon", Popular Astronomy, 1903&lt;/ref&gt; His 1922 article "A Meteoritic Satellite" in ''[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]]'' resulted in increased searches for small natural satellites by amateur astronomers.&lt;ref name="Schlyter"&gt;Schlyter, Paul. [http://www.nineplanets.org/hypo.html#moon2 nineplanets.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Pickering had also proposed the Moon itself had broken off from Earth.&lt;ref name="Pickering"&gt;{{citation | last = Pickering | first = W.H | title = The Place of Origin of the Moon&amp;nbsp;‚Äî The Volcani Problems | journal = Popular Astronomy | pages = 274‚Äì287| year = 1907 | bibcode = 1907PA.....15..274P | volume = 15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1954 the [[United States Army]]'s Office of Ordnance Research commissioned [[Clyde Tombaugh]], discoverer of [[Pluto]], to search for near-Earth asteroids. The Army issued a public statement to explain the rationale for this survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Armed Forces Seeks "Steppingstone to Stars" | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = 1954-03-04 | url = http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_LATimes_SciNL_1954.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Keyhoe]], who was later director of the [[National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena]] (NICAP), a UFO research group, said that his [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] source had told him that the actual reason for the quickly initiated search was that two near-Earth objects had been picked up on new long-range [[radar]] in mid-1953. In May 1954, Keyhoe asserted that the search had been successful, and either one or two objects had been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = 1 or 2 Artificial Satellites Circling Earth, Says Expert | newspaper = San Francisco Examiner | page = 14 | date = 1954-05-14 | url = http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_Keyhoe_May1954.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[The Pentagon]], a general who heard the news reportedly asked whether the satellites were natural or artificial. Tombaugh denied the alleged discovery in a letter to [[Willy Ley]],&lt;ref name="ley195707"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1957-07/Galaxy_1957_07#page/n61/mode/2up | title=For Your Information | work=Galaxy Science Fiction | date=July 1957 | accessdate=11 June 2014 | author=Ley, Willy | pages=61‚Äì71}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the October 1955 issue of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' magazine reported:
{{quote | Professor Tombaugh is closemouthed about his results. He won't say whether or not any small natural satellites have been discovered. He does say, however, that newspaper reports of 18 months ago announcing the discovery of natural satellites at 400 and 600 miles out are not correct. He adds that there is no connection between the search program and the reports of so-called flying saucers.&lt;ref name="Stimson"&gt;{{citation | last = Stimson | first = Thomas E., Jr | title = He Spies on Satellites | newspaper = Popular Mechanics | page = 106 | date = October 1955 | url = http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_PopMech_Oct55.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

At a meteor conference in Los Angeles in 1957, Tombaugh reiterated that his four-year search for natural satellites had been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = 1957-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, he issued a final report stating that nothing had been found in his search.

===Modern status===
[[File:EarthTrojan1st path.jpg|thumb|left|{{mpl|2010 TK|7}} has a helical path (green) relative to Earth and its orbit (blue dots)]]
It was discovered that small bodies can be temporarily captured, as shown by {{mpl|2006 RH|120}}, which was in Earth orbit in 2006‚Äì2007.&lt;ref name=klotz/&gt;

In 2010, the first known [[Earth trojan]] was discovered in data from [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE), and is currently called {{mpl|2010 TK|7}}.

In 2011, planetary scientists Erik Asphaug and Martin Jutzi proposed a model in which a second moon would have existed 4.5 billion years ago, and later impacted the Moon, as a part of the accretion process in the formation of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature10289 | volume=476 | title=Forming the lunar farside highlands by accretion of a companion moon | journal=Nature | pages=69‚Äì72| bibcode=2011Natur.476...69J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quasi-satellites and trojans==
[[File:Orbits of Cruithne and Earth.gif|thumb|The orbits of Earth and the quasi-satellite Cruithne]]
[[File:Horseshoe orbit of Cruithne from the perspective of Earth.gif|thumb|When observed from Earth, Cruithne follows the yellow path which does not appear to circle the Sun.]]
Although no other moons of Earth have been found to date, there are various types of [[near-Earth objects]] in 1:1 resonance with it, which are known as [[quasi-satellite]]s. Quasi-satellites orbit the Sun from the same distance as a planet, rather than the planet itself. Their orbits are unstable, and will fall into other resonances or be kicked into other orbits over thousands of years.&lt;ref name="space.com" /&gt; Quasi-satellites of Earth include {{mpl|2010 SO|16}}, {{mpl|(164207) 2004 GU|9}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Transient co-orbital asteroids | author=Brasser, R. | journal=Icarus | volume=171 | issue=1 | pages=102‚Äì109 |date=September 2004 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2004.04.019 | bibcode=2004Icar..171..102B |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and [[3753 Cruithne]]. Cruithne, discovered in 1986, orbits the [[Sun]] in an elliptical orbit but appears to have a [[horseshoe orbit]] when viewed from Earth.&lt;ref name="space.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meeus" /&gt; Some went as far to nickname Cruithne "Earth's second moon".&lt;ref name="meeus"&gt;"More Mathematical Astronomy Morsels" (2002) {{ISBN|0-943396-74-3}}, [[Jean Meeus]], chapter 38: ''Cruithne, an asteroid with a remarkable orbit''&lt;/ref&gt;

The key difference between a satellite and a quasi-satellite is that the orbit of a satellite of Earth fundamentally depends on the gravity of the Earth‚ÄìMoon system, whereas the orbit of a quasi-satellite would negligibly change if Earth and the Moon were suddenly removed because a quasi-satellite is orbiting the Sun on an Earth-like orbit in the vicinity of Earth.&lt;ref name=Granvik2011 /&gt;

Earth possesses one known [[trojan (astronomy)|trojan]], a [[small Solar System body]] caught in the planet's gravitationally stable {{L4}} [[Lagrangian point]]. This object, {{mpl|2010 TK|7}} is roughly 300 metres across. Like quasi-satellites, it orbits the Sun in a 1:1 resonance with Earth, rather than Earth itself.

==Temporary satellites==
On 14 September 2006, an object estimated at 5 meters in diameter was discovered in near-polar orbit around Earth. Originally thought to be a third-stage Saturn [[S-IVB]] booster from [[Apollo 12]], it was later determined to be an [[asteroid]] and designated as {{mpl|2006 RH|120}}. The asteroid re-entered Solar orbit after 13 months and is expected to return to Earth orbit after 21 years.&lt;ref name="astronomy"&gt;{{citation | title = Is Another Moon Possible? | last = Yeomans | first = Don | date = April 2010 | work = Astronomy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer models by astrophysicists Mikael Granvik, Jeremie Vaubaillon, and Robert Jedicke suggest that these "temporary satellites" should be quite common; and that "At any given time, there should be at least one natural Earth satellite of 1-meter diameter orbiting the Earth."&lt;ref name=cornell&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth's Other Moons|author=Amy Shira Teitel|publisher=Universe Today|year=2011|url=http://www.universetoday.com/92022/earths-other-moons/|accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such objects would remain in orbit for ten months on average, before returning to solar orbit once more, and so would make relatively easy targets for manned space exploration.&lt;ref name=cornell/&gt; "Mini-moons" were further examined in a study published in the journal ''Icarus''.&lt;ref name=minimoons&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/4666/earths-many-moons|title=Earth's Many Moons - Astrobiology Magazine|work=Astrobiology Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"It would seem that the bodies had been traveling through space, probably in an orbit about the sun, and that on coming near the earth they were promptly captured by it and caused to move about it as a satellite."&lt;ref name=Chant1913&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chant|first=Clarence A.|authorlink = Clarence Chant |title=An Extraordinary Meteoric Display|journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada|date=May‚ÄìJune 1913|volume=7|issue=3|pages=144‚Äì215|bibcode=1913JRASC...7..145C}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And later in 1916, [[William Frederick Denning]] surmised:

{{quote|"[[1913 Great Meteor Procession|The large meteors which passed over Northern America on February 9, 1913]], presented some unique features. The length of their observed flight was about 2600 miles [4,200 km], and they must have been moving in paths concentric, or nearly concentric, with the earth's surface, so that they temporarily formed new terrestrial satellites.‚Äù&lt;ref name=Denning1916&gt;{{cite journal|last=Denning|first=William F.|authorlink = William Frederick Denning |title=The Remarkable Meteors of February 9, 1913|journal=Nature|date=April 1916|volume=97|issue=2426|page=181|doi=10.1038/097181b0|bibcode=1916Natur..97..181D}}&lt;/ref&gt; |sign=|source=}}

It has been proposed that NASA search for temporary natural satellites, and use them for a sample return mission.&lt;ref name=klotz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/asteroids-meteors-meteorites/asteroid-capture-earth-gravity-satellite-mini-moon-130207.htm|title=Mystery Mini Moons: How Many Does Earth Have?|work=DNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/23016-nasa-asteroid-capture-mission-minimoons.html|title=New Asteroid-Capture Mission Idea: Go After Earth's 'Minimoons'|work=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, an object was discovered orbiting the Earth, and initially designated {{mp|2015 HP|116}}, but more detailed investigation quickly showed the object to be the [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia spacecraft]], and the object's discovery soon was retracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/mpec/K15/K15HC5.html|title=MPEC 2015-H125: DELETION OF 2015 HP116|website=www.minorplanetcenter.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2015, a small object, temporarily designated [[WT1190F]], was found to be orbiting the Earth every ~23 days, and had been orbiting since at least late 2009. It impacted the Earth on November 13, 2015 at 06:18:34.3 (¬±1.3 seconds) UTC.

On February 8, 2016 a 0.5-meter object was discovered orbiting the Earth with a period of 5 days and given the temporary designation XC83E0D, and most likely lost. The object was later identified with the lost artificial satellite SR-11A, or possibly its companion SR-11B, which were launched in 1976 and lost in 1979.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

On April 8, 2016, an object, given the temporary designation S509356, was discovered with an orbital period of 3.58 days. Although it has the typical area-to-mass ratio (m^2/kg) of satellites, it has a color typical of [[S-type asteroid]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3232">'''Coal slurry''' is a mixture of solids (mined [[coal]]) and liquids (usually water) produced by a [[coal preparation plant]].  As a [[slurry]], coal is separated from non-combustable components (ash) and can be fractionated by particle size as well.  Coal slurry can be transferred by pipeline&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redvalve.com/rv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=137&amp;Itemid=56 Red Valve Company: Coal Slurry Pipeline]&lt;/ref&gt; or with specialised pumps such as a [[progressive cavity pump]] to pump the highly abrasive, corrosive and viscous coal slurry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Reasons why you should choose the right pump for coal slurry. | url=http://www.globalpumps.com.au/case-studies/2012/transferring-coal-slurry-made-easy/ | date=2012-07-18 | accessdate=September 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scale of water usage and hence potential costs and problems is large.  More than 7 billion tons of coal are mined per year (2010), using approximately 200 litres of water per ton.&lt;ref&gt;D.

Ideally, coal slurry consists only of crushed [[coal]] and water, which can be separated perfectly at low cost.  In practice, the separation is significantly costly(citation needed).  Furthermore, the slurry consists also of very fine coal dust that results in a waste called [[blackwater (coal)|blackwater]], which is stored in large impoundment ponds, often together with [[coal ash]].  Such ponds are susceptible to disastrous releases, such as the [[Buffalo Creek flood]] of 1972.   This impounded liquid waste can sometimes total billions of gallons in a single facility.  &lt;!-- coal ash is not coal slurryThe largest coal slurry impound in the United States, at [[Little Blue Run Lake]],  holds 20 billion gallons of coal ash and smokestack scrubber waste).&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopey|first=Don|date=3 April 2014|title=Little Blue Run coal ash site to close sooner; Plant owner must contain pollution |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2014/04/04/Coal-ash-site-to-close-sooner/stories/201404040080|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

'''David Howells Fleay''' [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] ({{IPAc-en|Àà|f|l|a…™}}; 6 January 1907 in [[Ballarat]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]&amp;nbsp;‚Äì 7 August 1993) was an Australian [[natural history|naturalist]] who pioneered the captive [[breed]]ing of [[endangered species]], and was the first person to breed the [[platypus]] (''Ornithorhynchus anatinus'') in captivity.

==Early years==
Fleay had an aesthetic upbringing: His mother, [[Maude Edith Victoria Fleay]], had studied painting under [[Frederick McCubbin|Fred McCubbin]]; his father, William Henry Fleay, was a manufacturing [[chemist]] in Ballarat. After education at a state primary school and later a private high school, [[Ballarat Grammar School]], Fleay was first employed in his father's chemist shop and then was briefly a teacher at Ballarat Grammar.

He left for [[Melbourne]] in 1927 to study for a Bachelor of Science degree and Diploma of Education at [[Melbourne University]]. There, he met another student, Mary '''Sigrid''' Collie, and they married in 1931, the same year that Fleay graduated having majored in [[zoology]], [[botany]] and education. He was employed as a teacher in Ballarat until 1934.

==Work in natural science==
Fleay's interest in the natural world coincided with the awakening of scientific interest in endangered species, and the realisation by the public that Australian animals were worthy of attention other than as a source of food.

He realised the importance of endangered species early in his career when, in 1933, he was the last person to photograph a captive [[thylacine]] or Tasmanian tiger at the [[Hobart Zoo]]. In the process he was bitten on the [[buttocks]], the scar from the injury carried proudly throughout his life.

In 1934, Fleay was asked to design and establish the Australian animal section at [[Melbourne Zoo]], and worked there for 4 years. During this time he had several scientific achievements, including the first breeding in captivity of the [[emu]], several bird species including the [[tawny frogmouth]], and [[marsupial]]s including the [[koala]]. He also commenced research into the breeding habits of the platypus. His next public education efforts were nature talks on a Melbourne radio station, in 1937. Later that year, disagreements with the zoo's management came to a head and Fleay was dismissed, principally because of his belief that native birds and animals should be fed what they would eat in the wild.

In 1962 Fleay co-founded the [[Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland]] with [[Judith Wright]], [[Brian Clouston]] and [[Kathleen McArthur]].

===Healesville Sanctuary===
Coincidentally, the [[Healesville Sanctuary]] some 90&amp;nbsp;km from Melbourne was in need of a director and he was appointed. The animals there included [[quoll]]s, [[Tasmanian devil]]s, [[dingo]]es and various birds of prey, to which he added [[tiger snake]]s that were milked for [[antivenene]], and platypus. Many animals were housed in large paddock-like areas with swing-weighted gates so that visitors could freely interact with the animals. He also conducted daily 'feeding' displays of the [[platypus]]es.

His greatest achievement at Healesville was in 1943, when he bred the first platypus in captivity. His platypusary (platypus enclosure) incorporated features of their native streams. On about 5 November 1943, "Corrie" was born. No-one other than Fleay successfully bred and reared a platypus until 1998 when Healseville Sanctuary again had success. Since then, breeding has occurred only twice more: at Healesville and [[Taronga Zoo]] (twins).

Between 1945‚Äì1947, Fleay led an expedition to Tasmania in an attempt to capture a breeding pair of thylacines, however he returned empty handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalworlds.org/thylacine/additional/fleay/Fleay_expedition_1.htm|title=The Thylacine Museum ‚Äì Error|first=Cameron|last=Campbell|website=www.naturalworlds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, he took three platypuses to New York for the [[Bronx Zoo]] where they occupied a platypusary built to his specifications. He studied animal husbandry at various zoos and wildlife sanctuaries across the US, returning to Healesville in October to discover that the Board had dismissed him for supposed unauthorised donations of animals to various foreign zoos. While untrue, this caused considerable hurt: He was demoted and remained at Healesville as a consultant.

He was also keeping a private collection of animals, but in 1951 the Government of Victoria legislated to prevent private individuals from charging fees for the public to see animal collections. This caused him to decide to move the collection.

===Burleigh, Queensland===
{{main|David Fleay Wildlife Park}}

[[File:Bridled nailtail wallaby-distribution map.JPG|thumb|Map showing past and present distribution of the bridled nailtail wallaby. This map is an inset from a sign located at David Fleay Wildlife Park in Burleigh Heads, Queensland.]]
After extensive research, the Tallebudgera Estuary in the hinterland behind [[Burleigh Heads|Burleigh]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Queensland]] was selected, the reasons including that it offered an untouched natural habitat for koalas apart from already having cleared areas (then farmland) for development of animal enclosures. The Fleays gradually acquired land and by 1958 had enclosures for people to see platypuses, snakes, dingoes, plain turkeys, ospreys, crocodiles and alligators; in contrast, bandicoots, flying foxes, sea eagles, wallabies and koalas, were free to visit from adjoining the forest. However, his focus was on the scientific study of the animals.

The area also included [[midden]]s used by earlier generations of the Gold Coast's Kombumerri [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal people]]. Fleay retained these heritage areas, and maintained good relationships with the Kombumerri.

The animals were fed partly from donations from local bakers and butchers, with local residents donating dead animals to feed the owls (or the goannas if no longer fresh); mice and rats were collected frequently from the McKerras Research Institute behind the hospital; worms were collected fresh daily for the platypuses; eels, pigeons and flying foxes were also killed to provide food for the owls, snakes and crocodiles.

Injured or sick animals from as far away as New Guinea and Central Queensland were accommodated at the sanctuary. Those that lived were kept for research or breeding; native animals, when recovered, were released into the wild; deceased animals were fed to the survivors.

In 1982, 37 acres (150,000 m¬≤) of the land owned by David and Sigrid Fleay was sold to the Queensland Government and became a Conservation Park. The following year, the 20 acre (81,000 m¬≤) main Fauna Reserve with its animal enclosures was also sold to the Government. The remainder of the site 7.5 acres (30,000 m¬≤) was transferred in 1985. Under the terms of this arrangement, David and Sigrid Fleay continued to live and work at the park: In 1983 it closed for 5 years for redevelopment and re-opened in 1988. The government retains the property as the [[David Fleay Wildlife Park]].

A '''desert''' is a barren area of [[landscape]] where little [[precipitation]] occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of [[denudation]]. About one third of the land surface of the world is [[arid]] or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called [[polar desert]]s or "cold deserts". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.

Deserts are formed by [[weathering]] processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or [[dust storm]]s. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony [[plain]]s where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a [[mosaic]] of smooth stones. These areas are known as [[desert pavement]]s and little further [[erosion]] takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources of water in the form of springs and seepages from [[aquifer]]s. Where these are found, [[Oasis|oases]] can occur.

Plants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, water-resistant [[Plant cuticle|cuticles]] and often spines to deter [[Herbivore|herbivory]]. Some annual plants [[Germination|germinate]], bloom and die in the course of a few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their [[urine]]. Some animals remain in a state of [[dormancy]] for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then [[Reproduction|reproduce]] rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.

People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. [[Nomad]]s have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of increased [[desertification]]. [[Desert farming]] is possible with the aid of [[irrigation]] and the [[Imperial Valley]] in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many [[trade route]]s have been forged across deserts, especially across the [[Sahara Desert]], and traditionally were used by [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] of [[camel]]s carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of [[slave]]s were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of [[solar energy]].

==Etymology==
English ''desert'' and its [[Romance languages|Romance]] cognates (including [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''deserto'', [[French language|French]] ''d√©sert'' and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''desierto'') all come from the [[ecclesiastical Latin]] ''dƒìsertum'' (originally "an abandoned place"), a participle of ''dƒìserere'', "to abandon".&lt;ref name=Harper&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=desert |title=Desert |author=Harper, Douglas |year=2012 |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2013-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between aridity and sparse population is complex and dynamic, varying by culture, era, and technologies; thus the use of the word ''desert'' can cause confusion. In English before the 20th century, ''desert'' was often used in the sense of "unpopulated area", without specific reference to aridity;&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt; but today the word is most often used in its climate-science sense (an area of low precipitation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/desert |title=Desert |work=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=2013-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phrases such as "[[desert island]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Desert+Island |title=Desert Island |work=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=2013-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Great American Desert]]", or [[Shakespeare]]'s "deserts of [[Bohemia]]" (''[[The Winter's Tale]]'') in previous centuries did not necessarily imply sand or aridity; their focus was the sparse population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History, Volume 2: Continental America, 1800‚Äì1867 |last=Meinig |first=Donald W. |year=1993 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-05658-7 |page=76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical geography==
A desert is a [[region]] of land that is very dry because it receives low amounts of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] (usually in the form of rain but may be snow, mist or fog), often has little coverage by plants, and in which streams dry up unless they are supplied by water from outside the area.&lt;ref name=EG&gt;{{cite book |title=Essentials of Geology, 3rd ed. |last=Marshak |year=2009 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-393-19656-6 |page=452 |url=http://www.gobookee.net/out.php?q=essentials+of+geology+3rd+edition&amp;t=2&amp;c=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deserts generally receive less than {{convert|250|mm|0|abbr=on}} of precipitation each year.&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; The potential [[evapotranspiration]] may be large but (in the absence of available water) the actual evapotranspiration may be close to zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Precipitation and evapotranspiration|url=http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/9780415395168/resources/chapter05manual.pdf|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semi-arid climate|Semideserts]] are regions which receive between {{convert|250|and|500|mm|0|abbr=on}} and when clad in grass, these are known as steppes.&lt;ref name="brittanica"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-70815/desert |author=Smith, Jeremy M.

===Classification===
Deserts have been defined and classified in a number of ways, generally combining total precipitation, number of days on which this falls, [[temperature]], and humidity, and sometimes additional factors.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt; For example, [[Phoenix, Arizona]], receives less than {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation per year, and is immediately recognized as being located in a desert because of its aridity-adapted plants. The [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] of Alaska's [[Brooks Range]] also receives less than {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation per year and is often classified as a cold desert.&lt;ref name="WalterBreckle2002"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Walter, Heinrich |author2=Breckle, Siegmar-W. |title=Walter's Vegetation of the Earth: The Ecological Systems of the Geo-biosphere |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SdaCSwxK5bIC&amp;pg=PA457 |year=2002 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-43315-6 |page=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other regions of the world have cold deserts, including areas of the [[Himalayas]]&lt;ref name="Negi2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Negi, S.S. |title=Cold Deserts of India|url=https://books.google.com/?id=54RgJ6FgMl0C&amp;pg=PA9|year=2002 |publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=978-81-7387-127-6 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other high-altitude areas in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="RohliVega2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rohli, Robert V. |author2=Vega, Anthony J. |title=Climatology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zhbqbrg2XswC&amp;pg=PA207 |year=2008|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |isbn=978-0-7637-3828-0 |page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polar deserts cover much of the ice-free areas of the Arctic and Antarctic.&lt;ref name="ThomasFogg2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas, David Neville|title=The biology of polar regions|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-ErSVcvhI4oC&amp;pg=PA64 |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-929813-6 |page=64|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LyonsHoward-Williams1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lyons, W.

Potential [[evapotranspiration]] supplements the measurement of precipitation in providing a scientific measurement-based definition of a desert. The water budget of an area can be calculated using the formula ''P'' ‚àí ''PE'' ¬± ''S'', wherein ''P'' is precipitation, ''PE'' is potential evapotranspiration rates and ''S'' is amount of surface storage of water. Evapotranspiration is the combination of water loss through atmospheric [[evaporation]] and through the life processes of plants. Potential evapotranspiration, then, is the amount of water that ''could'' evaporate in any given region. As an example, [[Tucson, Arizona]] receives about {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} of rain per year, however about {{convert|2500|mm|abbr=on}} of water could evaporate over the course of a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buel, S. W. |year=1964 |title=Calculated actual and potential evapotranspiration in Arizona |journal=Tucson, Arizona University Agricultural Experiment Station Technical Bulletin |volume=162 |page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, about eight times more water could evaporate from the region than actually falls as rain. Rates of evapotranspiration in cold regions such as Alaska are much lower because of the lack of heat to aid in the evaporation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mendez, J. |author2=Hinzman, L. D. |author3=Kane, D. L. |year=1998 |title=Evapotranspiration from a wetland complex on the Arctic coastal plain of Alaska |journal=Nordic Hydrology |volume=29 |issue=4‚Äì5 |pages=303‚Äì330 |issn=0029-1277 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deserts are sometimes classified as "hot" or "cold", "semiarid" or "coastal".&lt;ref name=encyclo/&gt; The characteristics of hot deserts include high temperatures in summer; greater evaporation than precipitation usually exacerbated by high temperatures, strong winds and lack of cloud cover; considerable variation in the occurrence of precipitation, its intensity and distribution; and low humidity. Winter temperatures vary considerably between different deserts and are often related to the location of the desert on the continental landmass and the latitude. Daily variations in temperature can be as great as {{convert|22|C-change|0}} or more, with heat loss by radiation at night being increased by the clear skies.&lt;ref name=Laity&gt;{{cite book |title=Deserts and Desert Environments: Volume 3 of Environmental Systems and Global Change Series |last=Laity |first=Julie J. |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444300741 |pages=2‚Äì7, 49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=wtAbzLLTcwcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=%22classification+of+deserts%22+&amp;ots=R1fE69omfL&amp;sig=zRHGP9dQL3kXcyYQkxw_huD006g#v=onepage&amp;q=%22classification%20of%20deserts%22&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg|thumb|alt=aerial view of ice sheet covered in snow Antartica|Cold desert: snow surface at Dome C Station, Antarctica]]
Cold deserts, sometimes known as temperate deserts, occur at higher latitudes than hot deserts, and the aridity is caused by the dryness of the air. Some cold deserts are far from the ocean and others are separated by mountain ranges from the sea and in both cases there is insufficient moisture in the air to cause much precipitation. The largest of these deserts are found in Central Asia. Others occur on the eastern side of the [[Rocky Mountains]], the eastern side of the southern [[Andes]] and in southern Australia.&lt;ref name="brittanica"/&gt; Polar deserts are a particular class of cold desert. The air is very cold and carries little moisture so little precipitation occurs and what does fall, usually as snow, is carried along in the often strong wind and may form blizzards, drifts and dunes similar to those caused by dust and sand in other desert regions. In [[Antarctica]], for example, the annual precipitation is about {{convert|50|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the central plateau and some ten times that amount on some major peninsulas.&lt;ref name=Laity/&gt;

Based on precipitation alone, [[hyperarid]] deserts receive less than {{convert|25|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall a year; they have no annual seasonal cycle of precipitation and experience twelve-month periods with no rainfall at all.&lt;ref name=Laity/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=John E. Oliver|title=The Encyclopedia of World Climatology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mwbAsxpRr0C&amp;pg=PA86|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-3264-6|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arid deserts receive between {{convert|25|and|200|mm|0|abbr=on}} in a year and semiarid deserts between {{convert|200|and|500|mm|0|abbr=on}}. However, such factors as the temperature, humidity, rate of evaporation and evapotranspiration, and the moisture storage capacity of the ground have a marked effect on the degree of aridity and the plant and animal life that can be sustained. Rain falling in the cold season may be more effective at promoting plant growth, and defining the boundaries of deserts and the semiarid regions that surround them on the grounds of precipitation alone is problematic.&lt;ref name=Laity/&gt;

A semi-arid desert or a [[steppe]] is a version of the arid desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity. These regions feature a [[semi-arid climate]] and are less extreme than regular deserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedesertbiomeproject.weebly.com/semiarid-desert.html|title=Semiarid Desert|website=The Desert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like arid deserts, temperatures can vary greatly in semi deserts. They share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas. They usually receive precipitation from 250&amp;nbsp;mm (10&amp;nbsp;in) to 500&amp;nbsp;mm (20&amp;nbsp;in) but this can vary due to evapotranspiration and soil nutrition. Semi deserts can be found in the [[Tabernas Desert]] (and some of the Spanish Plateau), [[The Sahel]], The [[Eurasian Steppe]], most of [[Central Asia]], the [[Western US]], most of [[Northern Mexico]], portions of South America (especially in [[Argentina]]) and the [[Australian Outback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/climatetypes/semiarid|title=Semiarid - Climate Types for Kids|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They usually feature ''BSh'' (hot steppe) or ''BSk'' (temperate steppe) in the [[K√∂ppen climate classification]].

Coastal deserts are mostly found on the western edges of continental land masses in regions where cold currents approach the land or cold water upwellings rise from the ocean depths. The cool winds crossing this water pick up little moisture and the coastal regions have low temperatures and very low rainfall, the main precipitation being in the form of fog and dew. The range of temperatures on a daily and annual scale is relatively low, being {{convert|11|C-change|0}} and {{convert|5|C-change|0}} respectively in the [[Atacama Desert]]. Deserts of this type are often long and narrow and bounded to the east by mountain ranges. They occur in [[Namibia]], [[Chile]], southern California and [[Baja California]]. Other coastal deserts influenced by cold currents are found in [[Western Australia]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Horn of Africa]], and the western fringes of the Sahara.&lt;ref name=Laity/&gt;

In 1961, [[Peveril Meigs]] divided desert regions on Earth into three categories according to the amount of precipitation they received. In this now widely accepted system, extremely arid lands have at least twelve consecutive months without precipitation, arid lands have less than 250&amp;nbsp;mm (10&amp;nbsp;in) of annual precipitation, and semiarid lands have a mean annual precipitation of between 250 and 500&amp;nbsp;mm (10‚Äì20&amp;nbsp;in). Both extremely arid and arid lands are considered to be deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as [[steppes]] when they are grasslands.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

[[File:Agasthiyamalai range and Tirunelveli rainshadow.jpg|thumb|left|alt=desert behind mountains because of the rain shadow effect|The [[Agasthiyamalai]] hills cut off [[Tirunelveli district|Tirunelveli]] in [[India]] from the [[monsoon]]s, creating a [[rainshadow]] region.]]
Deserts are also classified, according to their geographical location and dominant weather pattern, as trade wind, mid-latitude, rain shadow, coastal, monsoon, or [[polar desert]]s.&lt;ref name=Destypes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/types/ |title=Types of deserts |work=Deserts: Geology and Resources |publisher=United States Geological Survey |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade wind deserts occur either side of the [[horse latitudes]] at 30¬∞ to 35¬∞ North and South. These belts are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large-scale descent of dry air moving from high-altitudes toward the poles. The Sahara Desert is of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/26634/desert/formation.htm |title=The formation of deserts |work=Desert |publisher=Oracle ThinkQuest Education Foundation |accessdate=2013-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017193948/http://library.thinkquest.org/26634/desert/formation.htm |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mid-latitude deserts occur between 30¬∞ and 50¬∞ North and South. They are mostly in areas remote from the sea where most of the moisture has already precipitated from the prevailing winds. They include the [[Tengger Desert|Tengger]] and [[Sonoran Desert]]s.&lt;ref name=Destypes/&gt; Monsoon deserts are similar. They occur in regions where large temperature differences occur between sea and land. Moist warm air rises over the land, deposits its water content and circulates back to sea. Further inland, areas receive very little precipitation. The [[Thar Desert]] near the India/Pakistan border is of this type.&lt;ref name=Destypes/&gt;

In some parts of the world, deserts are created by a [[rain shadow]] effect. [[Orographic lift]] occurs as air masses rise to pass over high ground. In the process they cool and lose much of their moisture by precipitation on the [[windward]] slope of the [[mountain range]]. When they descend on the [[leeward]] side, they warm and their capacity to hold moisture increases so an area with relatively little precipitation occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/tg/wrnshdw/wrnshdw.htm |title=How mountains influence rainfall patterns |author=Brinch, Brian |work=USA Today |accessdate=2013-05-08 |date=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taklamakan Desert]] is an example, lying in the rain shadow of the [[Himalayas]] and receiving less than {{convert|38|mm|abbr=on}} precipitation annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110530/Takla-Makan-Desert |title=Taklamakan Desert |work=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online |accessdate=2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other areas are arid by virtue of being a very long way from the nearest available sources of moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pidwirny, Michael |year=2008 |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8e.html |title=CHAPTER 8: Introduction to the Hydrosphere (e) Cloud Formation Processes |publisher=Physical Geography |accessdate=2009-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220230524/http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8e.html |archivedate=2008-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Montane]] deserts are arid places with a very high [[altitude]]; the most prominent example is found north of the Himalayas, in the [[Kunlun Mountains]] and the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. Many locations within this category have elevations exceeding {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}} and the thermal regime can be [[hemiboreal]]. These places owe their profound aridity (the average annual precipitation is often less than 40&amp;nbsp;mm or 1.5&amp;nbsp;in) to being very far from the nearest available sources of moisture and are often in the [[Windward and leeward|lee]] of mountain ranges. Montane deserts are normally cold, or may be scorchingly hot by day and very cold by night as is true of the northeastern slopes of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Deserts: Deserts, Montane |last=Mares |first=Michael (ed.) |year=1999 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=978-0-8061-3146-7 |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3CbqZtaF4oC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=montane+desert&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uXCzhwkVQy&amp;sig=NtF1nUxig83OXWlHk11Rd7aTCMM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oz6OUZ2DLMKL0AXf04HYDA&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Deserts%2C%20montane%22&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polar deserts such as [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] remain ice-free because of the dry [[katabatic wind]]s that flow downhill from the surrounding mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Bockheim | first =J.

===Weathering processes===
[[File:GeologicalExfoliationOfGraniteRock.jpg|thumb|alt=granite rock with weathered exfoliation Enchanted Rock State Natural Area, Texas|Exfoliation of weathering rocks in [[Texas]], USA.]]
Deserts usually have a large [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] and seasonal temperature range, with high daytime temperatures falling sharply at night. The diurnal range may be as much as {{convert|20|to|30|C-change|0}} and the rock surface experiences even greater temperature differentials.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;{{cite book |title=Physical Geography: Process and System |last=Briggs |first=Kenneth |year=1985 |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |isbn=978-0-340-35951-8 |pages=8, 59‚Äì62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the day the sky is usually clear and most of the [[sun]]'s radiation reaches the ground, but as soon as the sun sets, the desert cools quickly by radiating heat into space. In hot deserts, the temperature during daytime can exceed {{convert|45|C|F}} in summer and plunge below freezing point at night during winter.&lt;ref name=Uwe11&gt;George, 1978. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sand from Gobi Desert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=multicolor grains of sand in a centimeter sample|One square centimeter&lt;br&gt;(0.16 sq in) of windblown sand from the Gobi Desert]]
Such large temperature variations have a destructive effect on the exposed rocky surfaces. The repeated fluctuations put a strain on exposed rock and the flanks of mountains crack and shatter. Fragmented strata slide down into the valleys where they continue to break into pieces due to the relentless sun by day and chill by night. Successive strata are exposed to further weathering. The relief of the internal pressure that has built up in rocks that have been underground for aeons can cause them to shatter.&lt;ref name=Uwe21&gt;George, 1978. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exfoliation joint|Exfoliation]] also occurs when the outer surfaces of rocks split off in flat flakes. This is believed to be caused by the stresses put on the rock by repeated expansions and contractions which induces fracturing parallel to the original surface.&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt; Chemical weathering processes probably play a more important role in deserts than was previously thought. The necessary moisture may be present in the form of dew or mist. Ground water may be drawn to the surface by evaporation and the formation of salt crystals may dislodge rock particles as sand or disintegrate rocks by exfoliation. Shallow caves are sometimes formed at the base of cliffs by this means.&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;

As the desert mountains decay, large areas of shattered rock and rubble occur. The process continues and the end products are either dust or sand. Dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder granites, limestone and sandstone.&lt;ref name=Uwe22&gt;George, 1978. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; There is a certain critical size (about 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm) below which further temperature-induced weathering of rocks does not occur and this provides a minimum size for sand grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smalley, I. J. |author2=Vita-Finzi, C. |year=1968 |title=The formation of fine particles in sandy deserts and the nature of 'desert' loess |journal=Journal of Sedimentary Petrology |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=766‚Äì774 |url=http://archives.datapages.com/data/sepm/journals/v38-41/data/038/038003/0766.htm |doi=10.1306/74d71a69-2b21-11d7-8648000102c1865d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the mountains are eroded, more and more sand is created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, a process known as [[Saltation (geology)|saltation]]. The whirling airborne grains act as a [[Abrasive blasting|sand blasting]] mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the ground.&lt;ref name=Pye4&gt;Pye &amp; Tsoar, 2009. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.&lt;ref name=Pye141&gt;Pye &amp; Tsoar, 2009. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dust storms and sandstorms===
{{main article|Dust storm}}
[[File:Sandstorm in Al Asad, Iraq.jpg|thumb|alt=dark brown sand storm about to engulf a motor pool|[[Dust storm]] about to engulf a military camp in Iraq, 2005]]
Sand and dust storms are natural events that occur in arid regions where the land is not protected by a covering of vegetation. Dust storms usually start in desert margins rather than the deserts themselves where the finer materials have already been blown away. As a steady wind begins to blow, fine particles lying on the exposed ground begin to vibrate. At greater wind speeds, some particles are lifted into the air stream. When they land, they strike other particles which may be jerked into the air in their turn, starting a [[chain reaction]]. Once ejected, these particles move in one of three possible ways, depending on their size, shape and density; [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], [[Saltation (geology)|saltation]] or creep. Suspension is only possible for particles less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm (0.004&amp;nbsp;in) in diameter. In a dust storm, these fine particles are lifted up and wafted aloft to heights of up to {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}}. They reduce visibility and can remain in the atmosphere for days on end, conveyed by the trade winds for distances of up to {{convert|6000|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=GlobalAlarm&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Yang, Youlin |editor2=Squires, Victor |editor3=Lu, Qi |title=Global Alarm: Dust and Sandstorms from the World's Drylands|chapter=Physics, Mechanics and Processes of Dust and Sandstorms|chapter-url=http://archive.unccd.int/publicinfo/duststorms/part1-eng.pdf |publisher=United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|year=2001|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denser clouds of dust can be formed in stronger winds, moving across the land with a billowing leading edge. The sunlight can be obliterated and it may become as dark as night at ground level.&lt;ref name=Uwe20&gt;George, 1978. pp. 17‚Äì20&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of a dust storm in China in 2001, it was estimated that 6.5 million tons of dust were involved, covering an area of {{convert|134000000|km2|abbr=on}}. The mean particle size was 1.44 Œºm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gu, Yingxin |author2=Rose, William I. |author3=Bluth, Gregg J.

[[File:Saltation-mechanics-i18n.png|thumb|left|alt=diagram of sand particles showing wind entrainment|Wind-blown particles: 1=Creep 2=Saltation 3=Suspension 4=Wind current]]
Sandstorms occur with much less frequency than dust storms. They are often preceded by severe dust storms and occur when the wind velocity increases to a point where it can lift heavier particles. These grains of sand, up to about {{convert|0.5|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter are jerked into the air but soon fall back to earth, ejecting other particles in the process. Their weight prevents them from being airborne for long and most only travel a distance of a few meters (yards). The sand streams along above the surface of the ground like a fluid, often rising to heights of about {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=GlobalAlarm/&gt; In a really severe steady blow, {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} is about as high as the sand stream can rise as the largest sand grains do not become airborne at all. They are transported by creep, being rolled along the desert floor or performing short jumps.&lt;ref name=Uwe20 /&gt;

During a sandstorm, the wind-blown sand particles become electrically charged. Such electric fields, which range in size up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment. They are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and nausea.&lt;ref name=Uwe20/&gt; The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a negative charge when their diameter is under 250 Œºm and a positive one when they are over 500 Œºm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zheng, Xiao Jing |author2=Huang, Ning |author3=Zhou, You-He |year=2003 |title=Laboratory measurement of electrification of wind-blown sands and simulation of its effect on sand saltation movement |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres  |volume=108 |issue=D10 |doi=10.1029/2002JD002572 |bibcode=2003JGRD..108.4322Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Latham, J. |year=1964 |title=The electrification of snowstorms and sandstorms |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society |volume=90 |issue=383 |pages=91‚Äì95 |doi=10.1002/qj.49709038310 |url=http://www.idl.ku.edu/ara/AARPS/documents/ESD-emi/Latham_1963.pdf |bibcode=1964QJRMS..90...91L |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230220/http://www.idl.ku.edu/ara/AARPS/documents/ESD-emi/Latham_1963.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major deserts===
{{see also|List of deserts by area}}
[[File:deserts.png|thumb|upright=3|center|alt=global map of deserts|The world's largest non-polar deserts]]

Deserts take up about one third of the Earth's land surface.&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt;
Bottomlands may be [[salt]]-covered flats. [[Eolian processes]] are major factors in shaping desert landscapes. Polar deserts (also seen as "cold deserts") have similar features, except the main form of precipitation is snow rather than [[rain]]. [[Antarctica]] is the world's largest cold desert (composed of about 98% thick [[continent]]al [[ice sheet]] and 2% barren rock). Some of the barren rock is to be found in the so-called [[Dry Valley]]s of Antarctica that almost never get snow, which can have ice-encrusted [[saline lake]]s that suggest evaporation far greater than the rare snowfall due to the strong [[katabatic winds]] that even evaporate ice.

Deserts, both hot and cold, play a part in moderating the Earth's temperature. This is because they reflect more of the incoming light and their [[albedo]] is higher than that of forests or the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reflectance and albedo, surface in "Encyclopedia of the Atmosphere" |last=Coakley |first=J.

Many people think of deserts as consisting of extensive areas of billowing sand dunes because that is the way they are often depicted on TV and in films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/education/ask/?quid=121 |title=Misconceptions surround desert terrain, vegetation |date=2001-07-11 |work=Ask a Scientist |publisher=Cornell Center for Materials Research |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but deserts do not always look like this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/habitats/Deserts_and_xeric_shrublands | title=Habitats: Desert | publisher=BBC Nature | year=2013 | accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the world, around 20% of desert is sand, varying from only 2% in North America to 30% in Australia and over 45% in Central Asia.&lt;ref name="USGS-DF"/&gt; Where sand does occur, it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of [[dune]]s.&lt;ref name="USGS-DF"/&gt;

A sand sheet is a near-level, firm expanse of partially consolidated particles in a layer that varies from a few centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.agc.army.mil/research/products/desert_guide/lsmsheet/lsplain.htm |title=Sand Plains/Sand Sheets |work=Desert Guide |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=2013-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420101357/http://www.agc.army.mil/research/products/desert_guide/lsmsheet/lsplain.htm |archivedate=2010-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24&amp;nbsp;km/h (15&amp;nbsp;mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to the average length of jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.agc.army.mil/research/products/desert_guide/lsmsheet/lssand.htm |title=Ripples, Sand |work=Desert Guide |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=2013-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226171511/http://www.agc.army.mil/research/products/desert_guide/lsmsheet/lssand.htm |archivedate=2010-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dune en.svg|thumb|left|alt=diagram showing movement of sand dune in relation to wind direction|Diagram showing barchan dune formation, with the wind blowing from the left]]
Sand dunes are accumulations of windblown sand piled up in mounds or ridges. They form downwind of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep take place on the windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10¬∞ to 20¬∞ while the lee slope is around 32¬∞, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly across the surface of the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.agc.army.mil/research/products/desert_guide/lsmsheet/lsdune.htm |title=Dunes, General |work=Desert Guide |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=2013-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123183616/http://www.agc.army.mil/research/products/desert_guide/lsmsheet/lsdune.htm |archivedate=2010-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or [[Erg (landform)|ergs]].&lt;ref name="USGS-TD"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/ | title=Types of Dunes | publisher=United States Geological Survey | date=1997-10-29 | accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape of the dune depends on the characteristics of the prevailing wind. [[Barchan]] dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as [[seif dune|seif]] dunes may form. These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the prevailing wind direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}}, making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.&lt;ref name="USGS-TD"/&gt;

[[File:Desert Pavement Mojave 2000.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph of desert pavement, small stones left behind by wind|Windswept [[desert pavement]] of small, smooth, closely packed stones in the [[Mojave desert]]]]
A large part of the surface area of the world's deserts consists of flat, stone-covered plains dominated by wind erosion. In "eolian deflation", the wind continually removes fine-grained material, which becomes wind-blown sand. This exposes coarser-grained material, mainly [[pebble]]s with some larger stones or [[cobblestone|cobbles]],&lt;ref name=Pye141 /&gt;&lt;ref name="USGS-DF"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/features/ | title=Desert Features | publisher=United States Geological Survey | date=1997-10-29 | accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving a [[desert pavement]], an area of land overlaid by closely packed smooth stones forming a [[Tessellation|tessellated]] mosaic. Different theories exist as to how exactly the pavement is formed. It may be that after the sand and dust is blown away by the wind the stones jiggle themselves into place; alternatively, stones previously below ground may in some way work themselves to the surface. Very little further erosion takes place after the formation of a pavement, and the ground becomes stable. Evaporation brings moisture to the surface by capillary action and calcium salts may be precipitated, binding particles together to form a desert conglomerate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/159076/desert-pavement |title=Desert pavement |work=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, bacteria that live on the surface of the stones accumulate a film of minerals and clay particles, forming a shiny brown coating known as [[desert varnish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Perry, R.

Other non-sandy deserts consist of exposed outcrops of [[bedrock]], dry soils or [[aridisols]], and a variety of landforms affected by [[fluvial|flowing water]], such as [[alluvial fan]]s, [[Sink (geography)|sinks or playas]], temporary or permanent [[lake]]s, and oases.&lt;ref name="USGS-DF"/&gt; A [[hamada]] is a type of desert landscape consisting of a high rocky plateau where the sand has been removed by [[aeolian processes]]. Other landforms include plains largely covered by gravels and angular boulders, from which the finer particles have been stripped by the wind. These are called "reg" in the western Sahara, "serir" in the eastern Sahara, "gibber plains" in Australia and "sa√Ø" in central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/43197.html | title=Hamada, Reg, Serir, Gibber, Sa√Ø | publisher=Springer Reference | year=2013 | accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tassili n'Ajjer|Tassili Plateau]] in Algeria is an impressive jumble of eroded sandstone outcrops, canyons, blocks, pinnacles, fissures, slabs and ravines.

When rain falls in deserts, as it occasionally does, it is often with great violence. The desert surface is evidence of this with dry stream channels known as [[arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] or [[wadi]]s meandering across its surface. These can experience [[flash flood]]s, becoming raging torrents with surprising rapidity after a storm that may be many kilometers away. Most deserts are in basins with no drainage to the sea but some are crossed by exotic rivers sourced in mountain ranges or other high rainfall areas beyond their borders. The [[Nile|River Nile]], the Colorado River and the [[Yellow River]] do this, losing much of their water through evaporation as they pass through the desert and raising groundwater levels nearby. There may also be underground sources of water in deserts in the form of [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], [[aquifer]]s, underground rivers or lakes. Where these lie close to the surface, [[Water well|wells]] can be dug and [[Oasis|oases]] may form where plant and animal life can flourish.&lt;ref name="USGS-DF"/&gt; The [[Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System]] under the Sahara Desert is the largest known accumulation of [[fossil water]].

Lakes may form in basins where there is sufficient precipitation or [[meltwater]] from glaciers above. They are usually shallow and saline, and wind blowing over their surface can cause stress, moving the water over nearby low-lying areas. When the lakes dry up, they leave a crust or [[hardpan]] behind. This area of deposited clay, silt or sand is known as a [[Dry lake|playa]]. The deserts of North America have more than one hundred playas, many of them relics of [[Lake Bonneville]] which covered parts of Utah, Nevada and Idaho during the last [[ice age]] when the climate was colder and wetter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geology.utah.gov/online_html/pi/pi-39/pi39pg01.htm |title=Lake Bonneville |publisher=Utah Geological Survey |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the [[Great Salt Lake]], [[Utah Lake]], [[Sevier Lake]] and many dry lake beds. The smooth flat surfaces of playas have been used for attempted vehicle speed records at [[Black Rock Desert]] and [[Bonneville Speedway]] and the [[United States Air Force]] uses [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in the [[Mojave Desert]] as [[Edwards Air Force Base|runways]] for aircraft and the [[space shuttle]].&lt;ref name="USGS-DF"/&gt;

Plants face severe challenges in arid environments. Problems they need to solve include how to obtain enough water, how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce. [[Photosynthesis]] is the key to plant growth. It can only take place during the day as energy from the sun is required, but during the day, many deserts become very hot. Opening [[stoma]]ta to allow in the [[carbon dioxide]] necessary for the process causes [[evapotranspiration]], and conservation of water is a top priority for desert vegetation. Some plants have resolved this problem by adopting [[crassulacean acid metabolism]], allowing them to open their stomata during the night to allow CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to enter, and close them during the day,&lt;ref name=stomata&gt;{{cite book|title=Stomatal function|year=1987|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=9780804713474|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp-aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA353&amp;dq=cactus+stomata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IQ-3Uq_7C6PmywOq0oGoAg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cactus%20stomata&amp;f=false|author=Eduardo Zeiger|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by using [[C4 carbon fixation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Osborne, Colin P.|author2 = Beerling, David J. |authorlink2 = David Beerling|year=2006 |title=Nature's green revolution: the remarkable evolutionary rise of C4 plants |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=361 |issue=1465 |pages=173‚Äì194 |issn=1471-2970 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2005.1737 |pmid=16553316 |pmc=1626541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many desert plants have reduced the size of their leaves or abandoned them altogether. Cacti are desert specialists and in most species the leaves have been dispensed with and the [[chlorophyll]] displaced into the trunks, the cellular structure of which has been modified to allow them to store water. When rain falls, the water is rapidly absorbed by the shallow roots and retained to allow them to survive until the next downpour, which may be months or years away.&lt;ref name=Uwe123&gt;George, 1978. pp. 122‚Äì123&lt;/ref&gt; The giant [[saguaro|saguaro cacti]] of the [[Sonoran Desert]] form "forests", providing shade for other plants and nesting places for desert birds. Saguaro grow slowly but may live for up to two hundred years. The surface of the trunk is folded like a [[concertina]], allowing it to expand, and a large specimen can hold eight tons of water after a good downpour.&lt;ref name=Uwe123 /&gt;

Cacti are present in both North and South America with a post-Gondwana origin. Other [[Xerophyte|xerophytic]] plants have developed similar strategies by a process known as [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biology.unm.edu/ccouncil/Biology_112/Summaries/Plant_Adaptations.html |title=Plant adaptations |author=Council-Garcia, Cara Lea |year=2002 |publisher=University of New Mexico |accessdate=2013-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104014524/http://biology.unm.edu/ccouncil/Biology_112/Summaries/Plant_Adaptations.html |archivedate=2015-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They limit water loss by reducing the size and number of stomata, by having waxy coatings and hairy or tiny leaves. Some are deciduous, shedding their leaves in the driest season, and others curl their leaves up to reduce transpiration. Others store water in succulent leaves or stems or in fleshy tubers. Desert plants maximize water uptake by having shallow roots that spread widely, or by developing long [[taproot]]s that reach down to deep rock strata for ground water.&lt;ref name=DEH/&gt; The [[saltbush]] in Australia has succulent leaves and secretes salt crystals, enabling it to live in saline areas.&lt;ref name=DEH&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nynrm.sa.gov.au/Portals/7/pdf/biodiversity/flora.pdf |title=Desert Flora |publisher=Australian Department of the Environment and Heritage |accessdate=2013-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426062725/http://www.nynrm.sa.gov.au/Portals/7/pdf/biodiversity/flora.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desertmuseum.org/programs/succulents_adaptation.php |title=How Plants Cope with the Desert Climate |author=Dimmitt, Mark A. |year=1997 |publisher=Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common with cacti, many have developed spines to ward off browsing animals.&lt;ref name=Uwe123 /&gt;

Some desert plants produce seed which lies [[Dormancy|dormant]] in the soil until sparked into growth by rainfall. When [[annual plant|annuals]], such plants grow with great rapidity and may flower and set seed within weeks, aiming to complete their development before the last vestige of water dries up. For perennial plants, reproduction is more likely to be successful if the seed germinates in a shaded position, but not so close to the parent plant as to be in competition with it. Some seed will not germinate until it has been blown about on the desert floor to [[scarify]] the seed coat. The seed of the [[mesquite]] tree, which grows in deserts in the Americas, is hard and fails to sprout even when planted carefully. When it has passed through the gut of a [[pronghorn]] it germinates readily, and the little pile of moist [[Feces|dung]] provides an excellent start to life well away from the parent tree.&lt;ref name=Uwe123 /&gt;  The stems and leaves of some plants lower the surface velocity of sand-carrying winds and protect the ground from erosion. Even small fungi and microscopic plant organisms found on the soil surface (so-called ''[[Soil crust|cryptobiotic soil]]'') can be a vital link in preventing erosion and providing support for other living organisms. Cold deserts often have high concentrations of salt in the soil. Grasses and low shrubs are the dominant vegetation here and the ground may be covered with [[lichen]]s. Most shrubs have spiny leaves and shed them in the coldest part of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss5/biome/deserts.html |title=Cold Deserts |year=1996|work=The desert biome |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
{{Main article|Xerocole}}
Animals adapted to live in deserts are called [[xerocole]]s. There is no evidence that body temperature of mammals and birds is adaptive to the different climates, either of great heat or cold. In fact, with a very few exceptions, their [[basal metabolic rate]] is determined by body size, irrespective of the climate in which they live.&lt;ref name=Scholander&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Scholander, P.

[[File:Cream-coloured Courser.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=cream-colored courser camouflaged for the desert|The cream-colored courser, ''[[Cursorius cursor]]'', is a [[camouflage|well-camouflaged]] desert resident with its dusty [[animal coloration|coloration]], [[countershading]], and [[disruptive coloration|disruptive]] head markings.]]
Deserts present a very challenging environment for animals. Not only do they require food and water but they also need to keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The [[cream-colored courser]] flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-[[camouflage]]d by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The [[sandgrouse]] is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the [[Depression (geology)|waterhole]] it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The [[desert lark]] takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.&lt;ref name=Uwe141&gt;George, 1978. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Being [[ectotherm]]s, [[reptile]]s are unable to live in cold deserts but are well-suited to hot ones. In the heat of the day in the Sahara, the temperature can rise to {{convert|50|¬∞C}}. Reptiles cannot survive at this temperature and lizards will be prostrated by heat at {{convert|45|¬∞C}}. They have few adaptations to desert life and are unable to cool themselves by sweating so they shelter during the heat of the day. In the first part of the night, as the ground radiates the heat absorbed during the day, they emerge and search for [[Predation|prey]]. [[Lizard]]s and [[snake]]s are the most numerous in arid regions and certain snakes have developed a [[Sidewinding|novel method of locomotion]] that enables them to move sidewards and navigate high sand-dunes. These include the [[Cerastes (genus)|horned viper]] of Africa and the [[Crotalus cerastes|sidewinder]] of North America, evolutionarily distinct but with similar behavioural patterns because of [[convergent evolution]]. Many desert reptiles are [[ambush predator]]s and often bury themselves in the sand, waiting for prey to come within range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Lacher, Jr. |first = Thomas E. |isbn=978-0-8061-3146-7 |page=108 |title=Encyclopedia of Deserts: ''Cerastes'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3CbqZtaF4oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amphibia]]ns might seem unlikely desert-dwellers, because of their need to keep their skins moist and their dependence on water for reproductive purposes. In fact, the few species that are found in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations. Most of them are fossorial, spending the hot dry months [[Aestivation|aestivating]] in deep burrows. While there they shed their skins a number of times and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof [[cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] to retain moisture. In the [[Sonoran Desert]], [[Couch's spadefoot toad]] spends most of the year dormant in its burrow. Heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others.

[[File:Morroco-arid-climate.jpg|thumb|alt=shepherd leaving his sheep outside of Marrakech, Morocco|Shepherd near [[Marrakech]] leading his flock to new pasture]]
[[File:Qeshm Museum-Iran 2018.jpg|thumb|Middle Paleolithic hunter-gatherers in a desert environment, south of Iran]]
People have been living in deserts for millennia. Many, such as the [[Bushmen]] in the [[Kalahari]], the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] in Australia and various tribes of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American Indians]], were originally [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They developed skills in the manufacture and use of weapons, animal tracking, finding water, foraging for edible plants and using the things they found in their natural environment to supply their everyday needs. Their self-sufficient skills and knowledge were passed down through the generations by word of mouth.&lt;ref name=Fagan&gt;{{cite book |title=People of the Earth |last=Fagan |first=Brian M. |year=2004 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-205-73567-9 |pages=169‚Äì181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cultures developed a [[Nomadic pastoralism|nomadic way of life]] as herders of [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[cattle]], camels, [[yak]]s, [[llama]]s or [[reindeer]]. They travelled over large areas with their herds, moving to new pastures as seasonal and erratic rainfall encouraged new plant growth. They took with them their tents made of cloth or skins draped over poles and their diet included milk, blood and sometimes meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dyson-Hudson, Rada |author2=Dyson-Hudson, Neville |year=1980 |title=Nomadic pastoralism |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=9 |pages=15‚Äì61 |jstor=2155728 |doi=10.1146/annurev.an.09.100180.000311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The desert nomads were also traders. The Sahara is a very large expanse of land stretching from the Atlantic rim to Egypt. [[Trans-Saharan trade|Trade routes]] were developed linking the [[Sahel]] in the south with the fertile Mediterranean region to the north and large numbers of camels were used to carry valuable goods across the desert interior. The [[Tuareg]] were traders and the goods transported traditionally included [[slave]]s, [[ivory]] and [[gold]] going northwards and salt going southwards.

Round the rims of deserts, where more precipitation occurred and conditions were more suitable, some groups took to cultivating crops. This may have happened when [[drought]] caused the death of herd animals, forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation. With few inputs, they were at the mercy of the weather and may have lived at bare [[subsistence]] level. The land they cultivated reduced the area available to nomadic herders, causing disputes over land. The semi-arid fringes of the desert have fragile soils which are at risk of erosion when exposed, as happened in the American [[Dust Bowl]] in the 1930s. The grasses that held the soil in place were ploughed under, and a series of dry years caused crop failures, while enormous dust storms blew the topsoil away. Half a million Americans were forced to leave their land in this catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=First Measured Century: Interview:James Gregory | url=https://www.pbs.org/fmc/interviews/gregory.htm |accessdate=2013-05-25 | publisher=Public Broadcasting Service }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar damage is being done today to the semi-arid areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/events/desertificationday/background.shtml |title=Desertification: Facts and figures |work= |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desertification]] is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation plays a major role in determining the composition of the soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geeson |first1=Nicola |last2=Brandt |first2=C.

===Natural resource extraction===
[[File:Jodhpurplant.jpg|thumb|alt=see description|A mining plant near [[Jodhpur]], India]]

Deserts contain substantial mineral resources, sometimes over their entire surface, giving them their characteristic colors. For example, the red of many sand deserts comes from [[laterite]] minerals.&lt;ref&gt;van Dalen, Dorrit (2009) ''Landenreeks Tsjaad'', KIT Publishers, {{ISBN|978-90-6832-690-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Geological processes in a desert climate can concentrate [[mineral]]s into valuable deposits. [[Leaching (pedology)|Leaching]] by [[ground water]] can extract [[ore]] minerals and redeposit them, according to the [[water table]], in concentrated form.&lt;ref name="USGS-minerals"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/minerals | title=Mineral Resources in Deserts | publisher=US Geological Survey | date=1997-10-29 | accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, evaporation tends to concentrate minerals in desert lakes, creating dry lake beds or [[Sink (geography)|playas]] rich in minerals. Evaporation can concentrate minerals as a variety of [[evaporite]] deposits, including [[gypsum]], [[sodium nitrate]], [[sodium chloride]] and [[Borate mineral|borates]].&lt;ref name="USGS-minerals"/&gt; Evaporites are found in the USA's [[Great Basin Desert]], historically exploited by the "20-mule teams" pulling carts of borax from [[Death Valley]] to the nearest [[railroad|railway]].&lt;ref name="USGS-minerals"/&gt; A desert especially rich in mineral salts is the [[Atacama Desert]], [[Chile]], where sodium nitrate has been mined for [[explosive]]s and [[fertilizer]] since around 1850.&lt;ref name="USGS-minerals"/&gt; Other desert minerals are [[copper]] from Chile, [[Peru]], and [[Iran]], and [[iron]] and [[uranium]] in [[Australia]]. Many other metals, salts and commercially valuable types of rock such as [[pumice]] are extracted from deserts around the world.&lt;ref name="USGS-minerals"/&gt;

Oil and gas form on the bottom of shallow seas when micro-organisms decompose under anoxic conditions and later become covered with sediment. Many deserts were at one time the sites of shallow seas and others have had underlying hydrocarbon deposits transported to them by the movement of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-is-oil-usually-found |title=Why is oil usually found in deserts and Arctic areas? |author=Anderson, Roger N. |date=2006-01-16 |work=Scientific American |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some major oilfields such as [[Ghawar]] are found under the sands of Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="USGS-minerals"/&gt; Geologists believe that other oil deposits were formed by [[aeolian processes]] in ancient deserts as may be the case with some of the major American oil fields.&lt;ref name="USGS-minerals"/&gt;

===Farming===
{{Main article|Desert farming}}
[[File:View from above in the USA.JPG|thumb|left|alt=aerial view of the Imperial valley showing the pattern of irrigation|Mosaic of fields in [[Imperial Valley]]]]

Traditional desert farming systems have long been established in North Africa, irrigation being the key to success in an area where water stress is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include [[drip irrigation]], the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion.&lt;ref name=Marasco/&gt; It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these [[rhizobacteria]]l suspensions could be inoculated into the soil in the vicinity of the plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=Marasco&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marasco, Ramona |author2=Rolli, Eleonora |author3=Ettoumi, Besma |author4=Vigani, Gianpiero |author5=Mapelli, Francesca |author6=Borin, Sara |author7=Abou-Hadid, Ayman F. |author8=El-Behairy, Usama A. |author9=Sorlini, Claudia |author10=Cherif, Ameur |author11=Zocchi, Graziano |author12=Daffonchio, Daniele |year=2012 |title=A drought resistance-promoting microbiome is selected by root system under desert farming |journal=PLOS ONE |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0048479 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0048479 |volume=7 |pages=e48479|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...748479M |pmid=23119032 |pmc=3485337}}&lt;/ref&gt; A field trial in the Sonoran Desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixing]] bacterium ''[[Azospirillum brasilense]]'' with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.&lt;ref name=Marasco/&gt;

The Judean Desert was farmed in the 7th century BC during the Iron Age to supply food for desert forts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stager, Lawrence E. |year=1976 |title=Farming in the Judean Desert during the Iron Age |journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research |volume=221 |pages=145‚Äì158 |jstor=1356097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans in the south western United States became agriculturalists around 600 AD when seeds and technologies became available from Mexico. They used terracing techniques and grew gardens beside seeps, in moist areas at the foot of dunes, near streams providing flood irrigation and in areas irrigated by extensive specially built canals. The [[Hohokam]] tribe constructed over {{convert|500|mi}} of large canals and maintained them for centuries, an impressive feat of engineering. They grew maize, beans, squash and peppers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/southwest.html |title=Agricultural Societies In Pre-European Times: Southwestern U.S. and Northwestern Mexico |author=Smith, Chuck |date=2002-10-14 |work=Native Peoples of North America |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern example of desert farming is the [[Imperial Valley]] in California, which has high temperatures and average rainfall of just {{convert|3|in|abbr=on}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vric.ucdavis.edu/virtual_tour/imp.htm |title=Imperial County Agriculture |date=2012-02-15 |publisher=University of California Cooperative Extension |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The economy is heavily based on agriculture and the land is irrigated through a network of canals and pipelines sourced entirely from the [[Colorado River]] via the [[All-American Canal]]. The soil is deep and fertile, being part of the river's flood plains, and what would otherwise have been desert has been transformed into one of the most productive farming regions in California. Other water from the river is piped to urban communities but all this has been at the expense of the river, which below the extraction sites no longer has any above-ground flow during most of the year. Another problem of growing crops in this way is the build-up of salinity in the soil caused by evaporation of river water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meadows, Robin |title=Research news: UC Desert Research and Extension Center celebrates 100 years |year=2012 |journal=California Agriculture |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=122‚Äì126 |doi=10.3733/ca.v066n04p122  |url=http://ucanr.org/repository/cao/landingpage.cfm?article=ca.v066n04p122&amp;fulltext=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The greening of the desert remains an aspiration and was at one time viewed as a future means for increasing food production for the world's growing population. This prospect has proved false as it disregarded the environmental damage caused elsewhere by the diversion of water for desert project irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mirage: the false promise of desert agriculture |last=Clemings |first=R. |year=1996 |publisher=Sierra Club Books |isbn=0-87156-416-5 |pages=1‚Äì247 |url=http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19961805097.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deserts are increasingly seen as sources for [[solar energy]], partly due to low amounts of cloud cover. Many successful solar power plants [[Solar power plants in the Mojave Desert|have been built]] in the [[Mojave Desert]].

The potential for generating solar energy from the [[Sahara Desert]] is huge, the highest found on the globe. Professor [[David Faiman]] of [[Ben-Gurion University]] has stated that the technology now exists to supply all of the world's electricity needs from 10% of the Sahara Desert.&lt;ref name=Register/&gt; [[Desertec Industrial Initiative]] was a consortium seeking $560 billion to invest in North African solar and wind installations over the next forty years to supply electricity to Europe via cable lines running under the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. European interest in the Sahara Desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land. The Sahara receives more sunshine per acre than any part of Europe. The Sahara Desert also has the empty space totalling hundreds of square miles required to house fields of mirrors for solar plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_38/b4195012469892.htm |title=Sahara Solar Energy Could Power Europe |author=Matlack, Carol |date=2010-12-16 |work=BloombergBusinessweek |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Negev Desert]], [[Israel]], and the surrounding area, including the [[Arava Valley]], receive plenty of sunshine and are generally not [[Arable land|arable]].

The Arabs were probably the first organized force to conduct successful battles in the desert. By knowing back routes and the locations of oases and by utilizing camels, Muslim Arab forces were able to successfully overcome both Roman and Persian forces in the period 600 to 700 AD during the [[Early Muslim conquests|expansion of the Islamic caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/muslimwars/articles/yarmuk.aspx |title=The Battle Of Yarmuk, 636 |author=Fratini, Dan |year=2006 |publisher=MilitaryHistoryOnline.com |accessdate=2014-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many centuries later, both world wars saw fighting in the desert. In the [[First World War]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkey|Turks]] were engaged with the British regular army in a campaign that spanned the Arabian peninsula. The Turks were defeated by the British, who had the backing of irregular Arab forces that were seeking to [[Arab Revolt|revolt]] against the Turks in the [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]], made famous in [[T. E. Lawrence]]'s book ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Seven Pillars of Wisdom | publisher=Private edition | author=Lawrence, T.

In the [[Second World War]], the [[Western Desert Campaign]] began in [[Italian Libya]]. Warfare in the desert offered great scope for tacticians to use the large open spaces without the distractions of casualties among civilian populations. [[Tank]]s and [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]] were able to travel large distances unimpeded and [[land mine]]s were laid in large numbers. However the size and harshness of the terrain meant that all supplies needed to be brought in from great distances. The victors in a battle would advance and their [[supply chain]] would necessarily become longer, while the defeated army could retreat, regroup and resupply. For these reasons, the [[front line]] moved back and forth through hundreds of kilometers as each side lost and regained momentum.&lt;ref name=Woolley&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woolley, Jo |year=2008 |title=Desert warfare |journal=History Today |volume=52 |issue=10 |url=http://www.historytoday.com/jo-woolley/desert-warfare }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its most easterly point was at [[El Alamein]] in [[Egypt]], where the Allies decisively defeated the Axis forces in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Alamein | publisher=John Murray | author=Latimer, Jon | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-7195-6203-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The desert is generally thought of as a barren and empty landscape.

[[Mars]] is the only planet in the [[Solar System]] on which deserts have been identified. Despite its low surface atmospheric pressure (only 1/100 of that of the Earth), the patterns of atmospheric circulation on Mars have formed a sea of circumpolar sand more than 5 million km¬≤ (1.9&amp;nbsp;million sq mi) in area, much larger than deserts on Earth. The Martian deserts principally consist of dunes in the form of half-moons in flat areas near the permanent polar ice caps in the north of the planet. The smaller dune fields occupy the bottom of many of the craters situated in the Martian polar regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelivingmoon.com/43ancients/02files/Mars_Blue_Bird_Landforms_01.html |title=Strange Land Formations on Mars |date=2007-04-11 |work=The Blue Bird Files |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of the surface of rocks by [[laser]] beamed from the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] have shown a surface film that resembles the desert varnish found on Earth although it might just be surface dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/5409/do-mars-rocks-have-desert-varnish |title=Do Mars Rocks Have Desert Varnish? |date=2013-03-23 |work=Astrobiology |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], a moon of [[Saturn]], also has a [[Titan (moon)#Dark terrain|desert-like surface]] with dune seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Arnold, K. |author2=Radebaugh, J. |author3=Savage, C.

'''''Dirt! The Movie''''' is a 2009 American [[documentary film]] directed by filmmakers Gene Rosow and Bill Benenson and narrated by [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]. It was inspired by the book ''Dirt: The Ecstatic Skin of the Earth'' by William Bryant Logan. The documentary starred environmentalists like Wangari Maathai, Vandana Shiva, Gary Vaynerchuk, Paul Stamets and Bill Logan. The film explores the relationship between humans and [[soil]], including its necessity for human life and impacts by society. 

''Dirt! The Movie'' was an official selection for the [[25th Sundance Film Festival|2009 Sundance Film Festival]]  and won several awards, including the best documentary award at the 2009 Visions/Voices Environmental Film Festival and the "Best film for our future" award at the 2009 Mendocino Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefilmyap.com/2010/04/06/dirt-the-movie/ |title=Dirt!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6366">In a real [[Simple harmonic motion#Examples|spring‚Äìmass system]], the [[Spring (device)|spring]] has a non-negligible [[mass]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Since not all of the spring's length moves at the same velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; as the suspended mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, its [[kinetic energy]] is not equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} m v^2&lt;/math&gt;. As such, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; cannot be simply added to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to determine the [[frequency]] of oscillation, and the '''effective mass''' of the spring is defined as the mass that needs to be added to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to correctly predict the behavior of the system.

==Ideal uniform spring==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Horizontal spring-mass system.png|right|frame|horizontal spring-mass system]] --&gt;
[[File:Simple harmonic oscillator.gif|right|frame|vertical spring-mass system]]
The effective mass of the spring in a spring-mass system when using an [[ideal spring]] of uniform [[linear density]] is 1/3 of the mass of the spring  and is independent of the direction of the spring-mass system (i.e., horizontal, vertical, and oblique systems all have the same effective mass). This is because external acceleration does not affect the period of motion around the equilibrium point.

We can find the effective mass of the spring by finding its kinetic energy. This requires adding all the mass elements' kinetic energy, and requires the following [[integral]], where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of mass element :

:&lt;math&gt;T =\int_m\frac{1}{2}u^2\,dm&lt;/math&gt;

Since the spring is uniform, &lt;math&gt;dm=\left(\frac{dy}{L}\right)m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the spring. Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;T = \int_0^L\frac{1}{2}u^2\left(\frac{dy}{L}\right)m\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{L}\int_0^L u^2\,dy&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity of each mass element of the spring is directly proportional to its length, i.e. &lt;math&gt;u=\frac{vy}{L}&lt;/math&gt;, from which it follows:
 
:&lt;math&gt;T =\frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{L}\int_0^L\left(\frac{vy}{L}\right)^2\,dy&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{L^3}v^2\int_0^L y^2\,dy&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{L^3}v^2\left[\frac{y^3}{3}\right]_0^L&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{3}v^2&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing to the expected original [[kinetic energy]] formula &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}mv^2,&lt;/math&gt; we can conclude that effective mass of spring in this case is ''m''/3. Using this result, we can write down the equation of motion of the spring by writing the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] in terms of the displacement &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from the spring's unstretched position (ignoring constant potential terms and taking the upwards direction as positive):

: &lt;math&gt; L = T - V &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{3}\dot{x}^2 + \frac{1}{2}M \dot{x}^2 - \frac{1}{2} k x^2 - \frac{1}{2}m g x - M g x&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; here is the acceleration of gravity along the spring. Using the [[Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation]], we arrive at the equation of motion:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{m}{3}+M \right) \ddot{x} = -kx -\frac{1}{2} mg - Mg &lt;/math&gt;

We can find the equilibrium point &lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{eq}}&lt;/math&gt; by letting the acceleration be zero:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{eq}} = -\frac{1}{k}\left(\frac{1}{2}mg + Mg \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Defining &lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = x - x_{\mathrm{eq}} &lt;/math&gt;, the equation of motion becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{m}{3}+M \right) \ddot{\bar{x}} = -k\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator with period:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau = 2 \pi \left( \frac{M + m/3}{k} \right)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

So we can see that the effective mass of the spring added to the mass of the load gives us the "effective total mass" of the system that must be used in the standard formula &lt;math&gt;2 \pi \left( \frac{m}{k} \right)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; to determine the period of oscillation.

==General case ==
As seen above, the effective mass of a spring does not depend upon "external" factors such as the acceleration of gravity along it. In fact, for a non-uniform spring, the effective mass solely depends on its linear density &lt;math&gt;\rho(x)&lt;/math&gt; along its length:

::&lt;math&gt;T = \int_m\frac{1}{2}u^2\,dm&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt; = \int_{0}^L\frac{1}{2}u^2 \rho(x) \,dx&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt; = \int_{0}^L\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{v x}{L} \right)^2 \rho(x) \,dx&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt; = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \int_{0}^L \frac{x^2}{L^2} \rho(x) \,dx \right] v^2&lt;/math&gt;

So the effective mass of a spring is:

:&lt;math&gt;m_{\mathrm{eff}} = \int_{0}^L \frac{x^2}{L^2} \rho(x) \,dx &lt;/math&gt;

This result also shows that &lt;math&gt;m_{\mathrm{eff}} \le m&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;m_{\mathrm{eff}} = m&lt;/math&gt; occurring in the case of an unphysical spring whose mass is located purely at the end farthest from the support.

==Real spring==
The above calculations assume that the [[spring constant|stiffness coefficient]] of the spring does not depend on its length. However, this is not the case for real springs. For small values of &lt;math&gt;M/m&lt;/math&gt;, the displacement is not so large as to cause [[elastic deformation]]. Jun-ichi Ueda and Yoshiro Sadamoto have found&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.jps.jp/doi/abs/10.1143/JPSJ.66.367&lt;/ref&gt; that as &lt;math&gt;M/m&lt;/math&gt; increases beyond 7, the effective mass of a spring in a vertical spring-mass system becomes smaller than Rayleigh's value &lt;math&gt;m/3&lt;/math&gt; and eventually reaches negative values. This unexpected behavior of the effective mass can be explained in terms of the elastic after-effect (which is the spring's not returning to its original length after the load is removed).

'''Energy in the Central African Republic''' is a growing [[industry]] with plenty of potential.

==Hydroelectricity==
Electric power production totaled 103&amp;nbsp;GWh in 2002, with consumption at 96&amp;nbsp;GWh for that same year. The capital city of [[Bangui]] is supplied by two hydroelectric generators and one thermal plant. A new dam on the [[Mbali River]] (a joint project with [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), which permits year-round hydroelectric generation, opened in late 1991. Total generating capacity was 40&amp;nbsp;MW in 2002, with thermal sources accounting for 21&amp;nbsp;MW and hydroelectric at 19&amp;nbsp;MW for that year.

==Oil and gas==
[[Exxon]] drilled an exploratory oil well in 1985, but further work was deemed economically infeasible. Any oil production would depend on the connection of a pipeline from [[Chad]] to [[Douala]], [[Cameroon]]. 

In 2002, the Central African Republic's average daily fuel imports included 610&amp;nbsp;barrels of distillate fuel oil, 590&amp;nbsp;barrels of [[jet fuel]], 530&amp;nbsp;barrels of [[kerosene]], and 470&amp;nbsp;barrels of [[gasoline]]. As of 2002, the country has no known reserves of oil, natural gas or [[coal]].

[[File:Corrientes-oceanicas-en.svg|thumb|Equatorial Counter Current (in black)]]

The '''Equatorial Counter Current''' is an eastward flowing, wind-driven current which extends to depths of 100-150m in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans.  More often called the '''North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC)''', this current flows west-to-east at about 3-10¬∞N in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Pacific]] basins, between the [[North Equatorial Current]] (NEC) and the [[South Equatorial Current]] (SEC).  The NECC is not to be confused with the [[Cromwell Current|Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC)]] that flows eastward along the equator at depths around 200m in the western Pacific rising to 100m in the eastern Pacific. 

In the Indian Ocean, circulation is dominated by the impact of the reversing Asian [[monsoon]] winds.  As such, the current tends to reverse hemispheres seasonally in that basin.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrtki, 1973, ''Science'', Vol. 181&lt;/ref&gt;  The NECC has a pronounced seasonal cycle in the Atlantic and Pacific, reaching maximum strength in late boreal summer and fall and minimum strength in late boreal winter and spring.  Furthermore, the NECC in the Atlantic disappears in late winter and early spring.&lt;ref&gt;Carton and Katz, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; 

The NECC is an interesting case because while it results from wind-driven circulation, it transports water against the mean westward wind stress in the tropics. This apparent paradox is concisely explained by Sverdrup theory, which shows that the east-west transport is governed by the north-south change in the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the [[wind stress]].&lt;ref&gt;Yu et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pacific NECC is also known to be stronger during warm episodes of the [[El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO).&lt;ref&gt;Wyrtki, 1973, ''Science'', Vol. 180&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Klaus Wyrtki]], who first reported this connection, suggested that a stronger than normal NECC could be the cause of an El Ni√±o because of the extra volume of warm water it carried eastwards.

There is also a South Equatorial Countercurrent (SECC) that transports water from west to east in the Pacific and Atlantic basins between 2¬∞S and 5¬∞S in the western basin and farther south toward the east.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Jun., 1959&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stramma, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  While the SECC is [[geostrophic]] in nature, the physical mechanism for its appearance is less clear than with the NECC; that is, Sverdrup theory does not obviously explain its existence. Additionally, the seasonal cycle of the SECC is not as defined as that of the NECC.

== Theoretical Background ==

The NECC is a direct response to the meridional change of the [[wind stress]] curl near the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ).  In part the NECC owes its existence to the fact that the ITCZ is not located at the equator, rather several degrees latitude to the north.  The change in the [[coriolis parameter]] (a function of latitude) moving across the equator combined with the ITCZ being located north of the equator leads to areas of convergence and divergence in the oceanic mixed-layer. This result is obtained from Ekman theory.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} Using the larger Pacific basin as an example, the resulting dynamic height pattern consists of a trough at the equator, and ridge near 5¬∞ degrees north, a trough at 10¬∞N, and finally a ridge closer to 20¬∞N.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrtki, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;  From [[geostrophy]] (the perfect balance between the mass field and velocity field), the NECC is located between the ridge and trough at 5¬∞N and 10¬∞N, respectively.

[[Sverdrup balance|Sverdrup]] theory succinctly summarizes this phenomenon mathematically by defining a geostrophic mass transport per unit latitude, M, as the east-west integral of the meridional derivative of wind stress curl, minus any Ekman transport. The Ekman transport into the current is typically negligible, at least in the Pacific NECC.  The total NECC is found by simply integrating M over the relevant latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Yu et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atlantic North Equatorial Countercurrent ==

The Atlantic NECC consists of the eastward zonal transport of water between 3¬∞N and 9¬∞N, with typical widths on the order of 300&amp;nbsp;km.  The Atlantic NECC is unique among the equatorial currents in that basin because of its extreme seasonality.  The maximum eastward flow is attained in late boreal summer and fall while the countercurrent is replaced by westward flow in late winter and spring.  The NECC has maximum transport of approximately 40 Sv (10^6 m3/s) at 38¬∞W.  Transport reaches 30 Sv two months per year at 44¬∞W, while farther east at 38¬∞W the transport reaches that level five months per year. The magnitude of the NECC weakens substantially east of 38¬∞W due to water being absorbed by the westward equatorial current south of 3¬∞N.&lt;ref&gt;Carton and Katz, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

While the variability of the Atlantic NECC is dominated by the annual cycle (weak late winter, strong late summer), there is also interannual variability as well.  The strength of the Atlantic NECC is notably stronger in years following El Ni√±o in the tropical Pacific, with 1983 and 1987 being notable examples.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  Physically, this implies that the altered convection in the Pacific Ocean due to El Ni√±o drives changes in the meridional gradient of wind stress curl over the equatorial Atlantic.

== Pacific North Equatorial Countercurrent ==

The Pacific NECC is the major eastward moving surface current that transports more than 20 [[Sverdrup|Sv]] from the West Pacific warm pool to the cooler East Pacific.  In the western Pacific the countercurrent is centered near 5¬∞N while in the central Pacific it is located near 7¬∞N.&lt;ref&gt;Yu et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  The northern boundary of the Pacific NECC is easily defined by the adjacent westward flow found in the North Equatorial Current (NEC).  The southern boundary, however, can be more ambiguous.  The southern boundary in the central Pacific is clearly defined by the westward South Equatorial Current (SEC) at the surface, but at depth it merges with the North Subsurface Countercurrent (NSCC).  In the western basin, the NECC may merge with the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) below the surface.  Generally, the current weakens to the east in the basin, with estimated flows of 21 Sv, 14.2 Sv, and 12 Sv in the western, central, and eastern Pacific, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Yu et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Atlantic NECC, the Pacific NECC undergoes an annual cycle.  Unlike the Atlantic however, the eastward Pacific NECC does not generally disappear.  During late boreal winter and spring, the current is weaker as the northeasterly trade winds are shifted south, and oppose the current.  When the northeasterly trades are shifted north and weaker in the later summer and fall, the NECC is stronger.  These seasonal fluctuations are in phase with that of the NEC, but opposite in phase to the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrtki, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fluctuations of the Pacific NECC with El Ni√±o ==

The Pacific NECC is known to be stronger during El Ni√±o events where there is anomalous warming of the eastern and central Pacific that peaks in boreal winter.  Klaus Wyrtki hypothesized in the early 1970s that an unusually strong NECC in the western Pacific would lead to an anomalous accumulation of warm water of the coast of Central America and, thus, El Ni√±o.&lt;ref&gt;Wyrtki, 1973, ''Science'', Vol. 180&lt;/ref&gt;  The sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific and the transport of the NECC are indeed highly correlated.  This does not, however, exclude other atmospheric and oceanic factors from contributing to anomalous warming.  ENSO is a complicated, coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in which basin-wide changes in sea surface temperatures, trade winds, and atmospheric convection are intimately related.

The '''Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory''' Model ('''HYSPLIT''')&lt;ref&gt;http://ready.arl.noaa.gov/HYSPLIT.php&lt;/ref&gt; is a computer model that is used to compute air parcel trajectories and dispersion or deposition of atmospheric pollutants. It was developed by [[NOAA]] and Australia's [[Bureau of Meteorology]].

One popular use of HYSPLIT is to establish whether high levels of air pollution at one location are caused by transport of air contaminants from another location. HYSPLIT's back trajectories, combined with satellite images (for example, from NASA's [[Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer|MODIS]] satellites), can provide insight into whether high air pollution levels are caused by local air pollution sources or whether an air pollution problem was blown in on the wind.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sonomatech.com/assets/pdfs/AGU2012_IndonesiaFires.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

HYSPLIT is rather unusual in that it may be run in client-server mode (HYSPLIT-WEB) from the NOAA website, allowing members of the public to select gridded historical or forecast datasets, to configure model runs, and retrieve model results with a web browser.

[[File:HakkoIchiu10sen.jpg|thumb|300px|Prewar 10-sen Japanese banknote, illustrating the ''Hakk≈ç ichiu'' monument in [[Miyazaki, Miyazaki|Miyazaki]]]]

{{Nihongo3|"eight crown cords, one roof" i.e. "all the world under one roof"|ÂÖ´Á¥ò‰∏ÄÂÆá|'''Hakk≈ç ichiu'''}} was a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[political slogan]] that became popular from the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] to World War II, and was popularized in a speech by [[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Fumimaro Konoe]] on January 8, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, Japanese Imperialism 1894‚Äì1945, pp. 226‚Äì7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The term was coined early in the 20th century by [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren]] [[Buddhist]] activist and nationalist [[Tanaka Chigaku]], who cobbled it from parts of a statement attributed in the chronicle ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' to legendary first emperor [[Jinmu]] at the time of his ascension.&lt;ref&gt;As early as 1928, the Japanese editorials were already preaching the theme of the ''hakko ichiu'' without using the specific term. Michio Nakajima, ''Tenn≈ç no daigawari to kokumin'', Aoki Shoten 1990, pp. 129‚Äì30.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor's full statement reads: "Hakk≈ç wo ooute ie to nasan" ({{nihongo2|ÂÖ´Á¥ò„ÇíÊé©„ÅÜ„Å¶ÂÆá„Å®ÁÇ∫„Åï„Çì}}, or in the original Sino-Japanese: {{nihongo2|Êé©ÂÖ´Á¥òËÄåÁà≤ÂÆá}}), and means: "I shall cover the eight directions and make them my abode".  The term ''hakk≈ç'' ({{nihongo2|ÂÖ´Á¥ò}}), meaning "eight crown cords", was a metaphor for ''happ≈ç'' ({{nihongo2|ÂÖ´Êñπ}}) or "eight directions".&lt;ref&gt;Jit≈ç {{nihongo2|Â≠óÁµ±}},Shirakawa Shizuka, Heibonsha, 1994, p. 302, {{nihongo2|Á¥ò}} entry. The ''kun''-reading ''ie'' for ''on''-reading ''u'' {{nihongo2|ÂÆá}} is now defunct, but at the time of the Nihon Shoki, readings were not yet fixed in the way that was later to become the case. Rather, any meaning associated with a Chinese character as used in Chinese was, in theory, available as a reading as evidenced by the sometimes extreme variation in the writing of even common words in the Nihon Shoki.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambiguous in its original context, Tanaka interpreted the statement attributed to Jinmu, as meaning that imperial rule had been divinely ordained to expand until it united the entire world. While Tanaka saw this outcome as resulting from the emperor's moral leadership, many of his followers were less pacifist in their outlook, despite some intellectuals' awareness of the inherent nationalist implications and reactions to this term. Koyama Iwao (1905‚Äì93), disciple of Nishida, and drawing off the [[Avatamsaka Sutra|Flower Adornment Sutra]], proposed the interpretation "to be included or to find a place". This understanding was rejected by the military circles of the nationalist right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jonckheere|first1=Fabrice|chapter=Hakko ichiu theory (&lt;span lang="ja"&gt;ÂÖ´ Á∫Æ ‰∏Ä ÂÆá&lt;/span&gt;)|chapter-url=http://jonckheeref.com/html/jonckheere_hakko_ichiu_eng.html]|title=Pacific War: the initial expansion|series=History of the last war no. 15|publisher=Caraktere ed|year=2011|issn=2104-807X|page=62|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111112821/http://jonckheeref.com/html/jonckheere_hakko_ichiu_eng.html|archivedate=November 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Kosei Ishii&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese in Western nations suffered from [[racial discrimination]] issues. In 1919, Japan proposed a [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|racial equality clause]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. Their proposal received the support of a majority but was vetoed by [[Woodrow Wilson]], in violation of the rules of the Conference on majority vote. In 1924, the U.S. Congress enacted the [[Asian Exclusion Act]], outlawing immigration from Asia. On December 6, 1938, the Five ministers council (Prime Minister [[Fumimaro Konoe]], [[Ministry of War of Japan|Army Minister]] [[Seishir≈ç Itagaki]], [[Ministry of the Navy of Japan|Navy Minister]] [[Mitsumasa Yonai]], [[Foreign Minister]] [[Hachir≈ç Arita]] and [[Finance Minister]] [[Shigeaki Ikeda]]), which was the highest decision making council at the time,&lt;ref name=mof&gt;{{cite web | title=Question Êà¶Ââç„ÅÆÊó•Êú¨„Å´„Åä„Åë„ÇãÂØæ„É¶„ÉÄ„É§‰∫∫ÊîøÁ≠ñ„ÅÆÂü∫Êú¨„Çí„Å™„Åó„Åü„Å®Ë®Ä„Çè„Çå„Çã„Äå„É¶„ÉÄ„É§‰∫∫ÂØæÁ≠ñË¶ÅÁ∂±„Äç„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„ÇãÂè≤Êñô„ÅØ„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åô„Åã„ÄÇ„Åæ„Åü„ÄÅÂêåË¶ÅÁ∂±„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„ÇãË™¨ÊòéÊñá„ÅØ„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åô„Åã„ÄÇ | publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan]] | url = http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/annai/honsho/shiryo/qa/senzen_03.html |accessdate = 2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gosho&gt;{{cite web |title=Áå∂Â§™‰∫∫ÂØæÁ≠ñË¶ÅÁ∂± |work=Five ministers council |publisher=[[National Archives of Japan|Japan Center for Asian Historical Record]] |url=http://www.jacar.go.jp/DAS/meta/listPhoto?IS_STYLE=default&amp;ID=M2006092115064531921 |page=36/42 |date=1938-12-06 |accessdate=2010-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726042931/http://www.jacar.go.jp/DAS/meta/listPhoto?IS_STYLE=default&amp;ID=M2006092115064531921 |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; took the decision to prohibit the expulsion of the Jews from Japan, Manchuria, and [[Republic of China|China]] in accordance with the spirit of racial equality.&lt;ref name=mof/&gt;&lt;ref name=gosho/&gt; Thereafter, the Japanese received [[Jewish refugees]] despite their ally [[Nazi Germany]]'s opposition.

With the economic impact of the [[Sh≈çwa financial crisis]] and the [[Great Depression]], this led in the 1930s to a resurgence of nationalist, militarist and expansionist movements. [[Hirohito|Emperor Sh≈çwa]] (known more commonly as Hirohito outside of Japan) and his reign became associated with the rediscovery of ''Hakk≈ç ichiu'' as an expansionist element of Japanese nationalistic beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bix, Herbert. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=zjmVltzm1kYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hirohito+and+the+Making+of+Modern+Japan&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA199,M1  ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan,'' p. 201.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The naval limitations treaties of 1921, and especially 1930, were seen as a mistake{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} in their unanticipated effect on internal political struggles in Japan; and the treaties provided an external motivating catalyst which provoked reactionary, militarist elements to desperate actions which eventually overwhelmed civilian and liberal elements in society.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, Samuel Eliot. (1948). [https://books.google.com/books?id=BozSWv25Gd8C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=Hakko+Ichiu:&amp;source=web&amp;ots=s2kXXsOHHI&amp;sig=u62e4i_DanWP1CEW9x7xcNGKehs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA3,M1  ''History of United States Naval Operations in World War II: The Battle of the Atlantic, September 1939 ‚Äì May 1943,'' pp. 3‚Äì10.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of ''Hakk≈ç ichiu'' serves as a changing litmus test of these factional relationships during the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;John Pike, (2011). [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/kodo.htm  "Kodo (Way of the Emperor)"]. ''GlobalSecurity.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

The term  ''Hakk≈ç ichiu'' did not enter general circulation until 1940, when the second Konoe administration issued a [[white paper]] titled "Fundamental National Policy" ({{nihongo2|[[:ja:Âü∫Êú¨ÂõΩÁ≠ñË¶ÅÁ∂±|Âü∫Êú¨ÂõΩÁ≠ñË¶ÅÁ∂±]]}} ''Kihon Kokusaku Y≈çk≈ç''), which opened with these words, and in which Prime Minister Konoe proclaimed that the basic aim of Japan's national policy was "the establishment of world peace in conformity with the very spirit in which our nation was founded"&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 309. &lt;br&gt;In the original text, {{nihongo2|„ÄåËÇáÂõΩ„ÅÆÂ§ßÁ≤æÁ•û„Å´Âü∫„Åç‰∏ñÁïåÂπ≥Âíå„ÅÆÁ¢∫Á´ã„ÇíÊãõÊù•„Åô„Çã„Åì„Å®„Äç}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the first step was the proclamation of a "new order in East Asia" ({{nihongo2|[[:ja:Êù±‰∫úÊñ∞Áß©Â∫è|Êù±‰∫úÊñ∞Áß©Â∫è]]}} ''T≈ça Shin Chitsujo''), which later took the form of the "[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]".&lt;ref&gt;James L. McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' p 470 {{ISBN|0-393-04156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the most magnanimous form, the term was used to indicate the making of a universal brotherhood implemented by the uniquely virtuous ''Yamato''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Piers Brendon]], ''The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s'', p43 {{ISBN|0-375-40881-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because this would bring people under the emperor's fatherly benevolence, force was justified against those who resisted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert P. Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan]]'' p 11 {{ISBN|0-06-019314-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1940 was declared the 2600th anniversary of the founding of Japan in part in celebration of ''hakk≈ç ichiu''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin P. Hoyt]], ''Japan's War'', p 196 {{ISBN|0-07-030612-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the celebrations, the government officially opened the ''Hakko-ichiu'' Monument (now Heiwadai Tower) at what is now [[Heiwadai Park|Miyazaki Peace Park]] in the city of [[Miyazaki, Miyazaki|Miyazaki]].

==World War II==
As the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] dragged on without conclusion, the Japanese government turned increasingly to the nation's spiritual capital to maintain fighting spirit.

Characterization of the fighting as a {{Nihongo|"holy war"|ËÅñÊà¶|seisen}}, similarly grounding the current conflict in the nation's sacred beginnings, became increasingly evident in the Japanese press at this time. In 1940, the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]] was launched to provide political support to Japan's war in China.

The general spread of the term ''Hakk≈ç ichiu'', neatly encapsulating this view of expansion as mandated in Japan's divine origin, was further propelled by preparations for [[:ja:Á¥ÄÂÖÉ‰∫åÂçÉÂÖ≠ÁôæÂπ¥Ë®òÂøµË°å‰∫ã|celebrating the 2600th anniversary of Jimmu's ascension]], which fell in the year 1940 according to the traditional chronology.  Stories recounted that Jimmu, finding five races in Japan, had made them all as "brothers of one family".&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. Dower]], ''War Without Mercy: Race &amp; Power in the Pacific War'' p223 {{ISBN|0-394-50030-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propaganda purposes===
After Japan declared war on the Allies in December 1941, Allied governments produced several [[propaganda film]]s citing the ''Hakk≈ç ichiu'' as evidence that the Japanese intended to [[World government|conquer the entire world]].

The official translation offered by contemporary leaders was "universal brotherhood", but it was widely acknowledged that that expression meant that the Japanese were "equal to the Caucasians but, to the peoples of Asia, we act as their leader".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen S. Large. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JD1iyqWwHQcC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202 Sh≈çwa Japan]''. New York: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998. p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hence ''Hakk≈ç ichiu'' meant to signify racial harmony and equality. In general, however, the subsequent brutality and racism of the Japanese led to people of the occupied areas regarding the new Japanese imperialists as equal to or (more often) much worse than Western imperialists.&lt;ref name="rhodes248"/&gt; The Japanese government directed that local economies be managed strictly for the production of raw war materials for the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;James L. McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' p 495 {{ISBN|0-393-04156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its war effort, [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|Japanese propaganda]] included phrases such as "Asia for the Asians!" and emphasized about the perceived need to liberate Asian countries from imperialist powers.&lt;ref name="rhodes248"&gt;Anthony Rhodes, ''Propaganda: The Art of Persuasion: World War II'', p248 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to win the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war in China]] was blamed on British and American exploitation of Southeast Asian colonies, even though the Chinese received far more assistance from the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;James L. McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' p 471 {{ISBN|0-393-04156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases local populations welcomed Japanese troops when they invaded, driving out [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]] and other colonial powers.&lt;ref name="rhodes248"/&gt;

===Allied judgement===
''Hakk≈ç Ichiu'' meant the bringing together of the corners of the world under one ruler, or the making of the world one family.&lt;ref name=judgment/&gt; This was the alleged ideal of the foundation of the Empire; and in its traditional context meant no more than a universal principle of [[Humanity (virtue)|humanity]], which was destined ultimately to pervade the whole universe.&lt;ref name=judgment/&gt; The way to the realisation of ''Hakk≈ç Ichiu'' was through the benign rule of the Emperor; and therefore the "way of the Emperor"‚Äîthe "Imperial" or the "Kingly way"‚Äîwas a concept of virtue, and a maxim of conduct.&lt;ref name=judgment/&gt; ''Hakk≈ç Ichiu'' was the moral goal; and loyalty to the Emperor was the road which led to it.&lt;ref name=judgment/&gt;  Throughout the years that followed measures of military aggression were advocated in the names of ''Hakk≈ç ichiu'' eventually became symbols for world domination through military force.&lt;ref name=judgment&gt;{{cite web|last=Clancey |first=Patrick |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/PTO/IMTFE/IMTFE-4.html|title= Chapter IV: The Military Domination of Japan and Preparations for War |website=HyperWar: International Military Tribunal for the Far East}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Heiwadai tower.jpg|thumb|left|''Hakk≈ç ichiu'' monument (renamed Heiwadai tower) in 2010]]

== 18th and 19th century  Ecological murmurs ==

===Arcadian and Imperial Ecology===

{{Main|Arcadian Ecology|}}
In the early Eighteenth century, preceding Carl Linnaeus, two rival schools of thought dominated the growing scientific discipline of ecology. First, [[Gilbert White]] a ‚Äúparson-naturalist‚Äù is attributed with developing and endorsing the view of [[Arcadian Ecology|Arcadian ecology]]. Arcadian ecology advocates for a ‚Äúsimple, humble life for man‚Äù and a harmonious relationship with humans and nature.&lt;ref name=Worster1994 /&gt; Opposing the Arcadian view is Francis Bacon's ideology, ‚Äúimperial ecology‚Äù. Imperialists work ‚Äúto establish through the exercise of reason and by hard work, man‚Äôs dominance over nature‚Äù.&lt;ref name=Worster1994 /&gt; Imperial ecologists also believe that man should become a dominant figure over nature and all other organisms as ‚Äúonce enjoyed in the Garden of Eden‚Äù.&lt;ref name=Worster1994 /&gt; Both views continued their rivalry through the early eighteenth century until Carl Linnaeus's support of imperialism; and in short time due to Linnaeus's popularity, imperial ecology became the dominant view within the discipline.

===Carl Linnaeus and Systema Naturae===

{{Main|Carl Linnaeus|Systema Naturae|}}
Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist, is well known for his work with [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] but his ideas helped to lay the groundwork for modern ecology. He developed a two part naming system for classifying plants and animals. Binomial Nomenclature was used to classify, describe, and name different genera and species. The compiled editions of ''Systema Naturae'' developed and popularized the naming system for plants and animals in modern biology. Reid suggests "Linnaeus can fairly be regarded as the originator of systematic and ecological studies in biodiversity," due to his naming and classifying of thousands of plant and animal species. Linnaeus also influenced the foundations of Darwinian evolution, he believed that there could be change in or between different species within fixed genera. Linnaeus was also one of the first naturalists to place men in the same category as [[primate]]s.&lt;ref name="Reid 18‚Äì31"/&gt;

===The botanical geography and Alexander von Humboldt===
Throughout the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, the [[Age of Sail|great maritime powers]] such as Britain, Spain, and Portugal launched many world exploratory expeditions to develop [[maritime commerce]] with other countries, and to discover new natural resources, as well as to catalog them.  At the beginning of the 18th century, about twenty thousand plant species were known, versus forty thousand at the beginning of the 19th century, and about [[The Plant List|300,000]] today.

These expeditions were joined by many [[scientist]]s, including [[botany|botanists]], such as the German explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].  Humboldt is often considered a father of ecology.  He was the first to take on the study of the relationship between organisms and their [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]].  He exposed the existing relationships between observed plant species and [[climate]], and described vegetation zones using [[latitude]] and [[altitude]], a discipline now known as [[geobotany]]. Von Humboldt was accompanied on his expedition by the botanist [[Aim√© Bonpland]].

In 1856, the [[Park Grass Experiment]] was established at the [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] to test the effect of fertilizers and manures on hay yields. This is the longest-running field experiment in the world.&lt;ref name="open.ac.uk"/&gt;

===The notion of biocoenosis: Wallace and M√∂bius===
[[Alfred Russel Wallace]], contemporary and colleague of Darwin, was first to  propose a "geography" of animal species.  Several authors recognized at the time that species were not independent of each other, and grouped them into plant species, animal species, and later into communities of living beings or [[biocoenosis]].  The first use of this term is usually attributed to [[Karl M√∂bius]] in 1877, but already in 1825, the French naturalist [[Adolphe Dureau de la Malle]] used the term ''societ√©'' about an assemblage of plant individuals of different species.

===Warming and the foundation of ecology as discipline===
While [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] focused exclusively on [[Competition (biology)|competition]] as a selective force, [[Eugenius Warming|Eugen Warming]] devised a new discipline that took abiotic factors, that is drought, fire, salt, cold etc., as seriously as biotic factors in the assembly of biotic communities. [[Biogeography]] before Warming was largely of descriptive nature ‚Äì faunistic or floristic. Warming's aim was, through the study of organism (plant) [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[anatomy]], i.e. adaptation, to explain why a species occurred under a certain set of environmental conditions. Moreover, the goal of the new discipline was to explain why species occupying similar habitats, experiencing similar hazards, would solve problems in similar ways, despite often being of widely different phylogenetic descent. Based on his personal observations in [[Brazil]]ian [[cerrado]], in [[Denmark]], Norwegian [[Finnmark]] and [[Greenland]], [[Eugenius Warming|Warming]] gave the first university course in ecological plant geography. Based on his lectures, he wrote the book  [[Eugenius Warming#'Plantesamfund' or 'Oecology of Plants'|‚ÄòPlantesamfund‚Äô]], which was immediate translated to German, [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], later to English as [[Eugenius Warming#'Plantesamfund' or 'Oecology of Plants'|‚ÄòOecology of Plants‚Äô]]. Through its German edition, the book had an immense effect on British and North American scientists like [[Arthur Tansley]], [[Henry Chandler Cowles]] and [[Frederic Clements]].&lt;ref name="Coleman1986"&gt;

=== Malthusian influence ===

{{Main|Thomas Robert Malthus|}}
[[Thomas Robert Malthus]] was an influential writer on the subject of population and population limits in the early 19th century. His works were very important in shaping the ways in which Darwin saw the world worked. Malthus wrote:
{{quote|That the increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence,

That population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase, and,

That the superior power of population is repressed, and the actual population kept equal to the means of subsistence, by misery and vice.&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'', in Oxford World's Classics reprint. p 61, end of Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[An Essay on the Principle of Population]] Malthus argues for the reining in of rising population through 2 checks: Positive and Preventive checks. The first raising death rates, the later lowers birthing rates.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. An Essay on the Principle of Population. Oxford World's Classics reprint. viii in Oxford World's Classics reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; Malthus also brings forth the idea that the world population will move past the sustainable number of people.&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. An Essay on the Principle of Population. Chapter 1, p 13 in Oxford World's Classics reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of thought still continues to influences debates on birth and marriage rates to this theory brought forth by Malthus.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. An Essay on the Principle of Population. Oxford World's Classics reprint. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; The essay had a major influence on Charles Darwin and helped him to theories his theory of Natural Selection.&lt;ref&gt;van Wyhe, John (2008b). Darwin: The Story of the Man and His Theories of Evolution. London: Andre Deutsch Ltd (published 1 September 2008). {{ISBN|0-233-00251-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This struggle proposed by Malthusian thought not only influenced the ecological work of Charles Darwin, but helped bring about an economic theory of world of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin's Malthusian Metaphor and Russian Evolutionary Thought, 1859-1917Author, Daniel P. Todes, p. 537-540&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darwinism and the science of ecology===
[[File:Charles Darwin by Julia Margaret Cameron 2.jpg|thumb|[[Julia Margaret Cameron]]‚Äôs portrait of Darwin]]
It is often held that the roots of scientific ecology may be traced back to Darwin.&lt;ref name="Stauffer1957"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last1=Stauffer |first1=R. C.
 |year=1957
 |title=Haeckel, Darwin and Ecology 
 |journal=[[Quarterly Review of Biology]]
 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=138‚Äì144
 |doi=10.1086/401754
 |pmid=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contention may look convincing at first glance inasmuch as ''On the Origin of Species'' is full of observations and proposed mechanisms that clearly fit within the boundaries of modern ecology (e.g. the cat-to-clover chain ‚Äì an ecological cascade) and because the term ecology was coined in 1866 by a strong proponent of Darwinism, [[Ernst Haeckel]]. However, Darwin never used the word in his writings after this year, not even in his most "ecological" writings such as the foreword to the English edition of [[Hermann M√ºller (botanist)|Hermann M√ºller]]‚Äôs ''The Fertilization of Flowers'' (1883) or in his own treatise of earthworms and mull formation in forest soils ([http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=2355 The formation of vegetable mould through the action of worms], 1881). Moreover, the pioneers founding ecology as a scientific discipline, such as [[Eugen Warming]], [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|A. F. W. Schimper]], [[Gaston Bonnier]], [[Fran√ßois-Alphonse Forel|F.A. Forel]], [[Stephen Alfred Forbes|S.A.

== Early 20th century ~ Expansion of ecological thought ==

=== The biosphere ‚Äì Eduard Suess and Vladimir Vernadsky ===
By the 19th century, ecology blossomed due to new discoveries in [[chemistry]] by [[Lavoisier]] and [[Horace-B√©n√©dict de Saussure|de Saussure]], notably the [[nitrogen cycle]].  After observing the fact that life developed only within strict limits of each compartment that makes up the [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], and [[lithosphere]], the Austrian geologist [[Eduard Suess]] proposed the term [[biosphere]] in 1875.  Suess proposed the name biosphere for the conditions promoting life, such as those found on [[Earth]], which includes [[flora (plants)|flora]], [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], [[mineral]]s, [[Biogeochemical cycle|matter cycles]], et cetera.

In the 1920s [[Vladimir I. Vernadsky]], a Russian geologist who had defected to France, detailed the idea of the biosphere in his work "The biosphere" (1926), and described the fundamental principles of the [[biogeochemical cycle]]s.  He thus redefined the biosphere as the sum of all [[ecosystem]]s.

First ecological damages were reported in the 18th century, as the multiplication of colonies caused [[deforestation]].  Since the 19th century, with the [[industrial revolution]], more and more pressing concerns have grown about the impact of human activity on [[Environment (biophysical)|the environment]].  The term [[ecologist]] has been in use since the end of the 19th century.

===The ecosystem: Arthur Tansley===
Over the 19th century, botanical geography and zoogeography combined to form the basis of [[biogeography]]. This science, which deals with habitats of species, seeks to explain the reasons for the presence of certain species in a given location.

It was in 1935 that [[Arthur Tansley]], the British [[ecologist]], coined the term [[ecosystem]], the interactive system established between the [[biocoenosis]] (the group of living creatures), and their [[biotope]], the environment in which they live.  Ecology thus became the science of ecosystems.

Tansley's concept of the ecosystem was adopted by the energetic and influential biology educator [[Eugene Odum]].  Along with his brother, [[Howard T. Odum]], Eugene P. Odum wrote a textbook which (starting in 1953) educated more than one generation of biologists and ecologists in North America.

===Ecological Succession ‚Äì Henry Chandler Cowles===
[[File:Indiana dunes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Indiana Dunes on Lake Michigan, which Cowles referred to in his development of his theories of ecological succession.]]
{{Main|Ecological succession|}}
At the turn of the 20th century, [[Henry Chandler Cowles]] was one of the founders of the emerging study of "dynamic ecology", through his study of [[ecological succession]] at the [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore|Indiana Dunes]], sand dunes at the southern end of [[Lake Michigan]].  Here Cowles found evidence of [[ecological succession]] in the [[vegetation]] and the [[soil]] with relation to age. [[Henry Chandler Cowles|Cowles]] was very much aware of the roots of the concept and of his (primordial) predecessors.&lt;ref name="The causes of vegetational cycles"/&gt; Thus, he attributes the first use of the word to the French naturalist [[Adolphe Dureau de la Malle]], who had described the vegetation development after forest clear-felling, and the first comprehensive study of successional processes to the [[Finland|Finnish]] botanist [[Ragnar Hult]] (1881).

===Animal Ecology - Charles Elton===

20th century English zoologist and ecologist, [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]], is commonly credited as ‚Äúthe father of animal ecology‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;Southwood, R.; Clarke, J. R. (1999). "Charles Sutherland Elton. 29 March 1900 -- 1 May: Elected F.R.S. 1953".&lt;/ref&gt; Elton influenced by Victor Shelford's ''Animal Communities in Temperate America'' began his research on animal ecology as an assistant to his colleague, Julian Huxley, on an ecological survey of the fauna in Spitsbergen in 1921. Elton's most famous studies were conducted during his time as a biological consultant to the Hudson Bay Company to help understand the fluctuations in the company's fur harvests. Elton studied the population fluctuations and dynamics of snowshoe hare, Canadian lynx, and other mammals of the region. Elton is also considered the first to coin the terms, food chain and food cycle in his famous book ''Animal Ecology''.&lt;ref&gt;Elton, C.S. 1968 reprint. Animal ecology. Great Britain: William Clowes and Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Elton is also attributed with contributing to disciplines of: invasion ecology, community ecology, and wildlife disease ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Ken. 2011. Animal Ecology - Legacy of Charles S Elton.http://www.journalofanimalecology.org/view/0/virtualissuelegacyofcharlesselton.html ed.Journal of Animal Ecology.&lt;/ref&gt;

===G. Evelyn Hutchinson - Father of Modern Ecology===
{{Main|G. Evelyn Hutchinson|}}

[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson|George ‚ÄúG‚Äù Evelyn Hutchinson]] was a 20th-century ecologist who is commonly recognized as the ‚ÄúFather of Modern Ecology‚Äù. Hutchinson is of English descent but spent most of professional career studying in New Haven, Connecticut at Yale University. Throughout his career, over six decades, Hutchinson contributed to the sciences of limnology, entomology, genetics, biogeochemistry, mathematical theory of population dynamics and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slobodkin | first1 = L.B. | year = 1993 | title = An Appreciation: George Evelyn Hutchinson | journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 62 | issue = 2| pages = 390‚Äì394 | jstor=5370 | doi = 10.2307/5370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchinson is also attributed as being the first to infuse science with theory within the discipline of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy, T. E. (2011). "George Evelyn Hutchinson. 13 January 1903 -- 17 May 1991". Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society 57: 167‚Äì177. {{DOI|10.1098/rsbm.2010.0016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchinson was also one of the first credited with combining ecology with mathematics. Another major contribution of Hutchinson was his development of the current definition of an organism's ‚Äúniche‚Äù ‚Äì as he recognized the role of an organism within its community. Finally, along with his great impact within the discipline of ecology throughout his professional years, Hutchinson also left a lasting impact in ecology through his many students he inspired.

== Ecological Influence on the Social Sciences and Humanities ==

===Human ecology===
{{Main|Human ecology}}
[[Human ecology]] began in the 1920s, through the study of changes in [[ecological succession|vegetation succession]] in the city of [[Chicago]].  It became a distinct field of study in the 1970s.  This marked the first recognition that humans, who had colonized all of the Earth's [[continent]]s, were a major [[ecological factor]].  Humans greatly modify the environment through the development of the habitat (in particular [[urban planning]]), by intensive exploitation activities such as [[logging]] and [[fishing]], and as side effects of [[agriculture]], [[mining]], and [[industry]]. Besides ecology and biology, this discipline involved many other natural and social sciences, such as [[anthropology]] and [[ethnology]], [[economics]], [[demography]], [[architecture]] and [[urban planning]], [[medicine]] and [[psychology]], and many more. The development of human ecology led to the increasing role of ecological science in the design and management of cities.

In recent years human ecology has been a topic that has interested organizational researchers. Hannan and Freeman (''Population Ecology of Organizations (1977)'', American Journal of Sociology) argue that organizations do not only adapt to an environment. Instead it is also the environment that selects or rejects populations of [[organizations]]. In any given environment (in [[Homeostasis#Ecological|equilibrium]]) there will only be one form of organization ([[isomorphism]]). [[Organizational ecology]] has been a prominent theory in accounting for diversities of organizations and their changing composition over time.

===James Lovelock and the Gaia hypothesis===
{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}
The [[Gaia theory (science)|Gaia theory]], proposed by [[James Lovelock]], in his work ''Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth'', advanced the view that the Earth should be regarded as a single living macro-organism.  In particular, it argued that the ensemble of living organisms has jointly evolved an ability to control the global environment ‚Äî by influencing major physical parameters as the composition of the atmosphere, the evaporation rate, the chemistry of soils and oceans ‚Äî so as to maintain conditions favorable to life. The idea has been supported by [[Lynn Margulis]] who extended her [[endosymbiotic theory]] which suggests that cell organelles originated from free living organisms to the idea that individual organisms of many species could be considered as symbionts within a larger metaphorical "super-organism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Ecosystems| year=1998| volume =1|issue=5|pages=431‚Äì436| title=Ecosystems and the Biosphere as Complex Adaptive Systems|first=Simon A.|last=Levin |doi=10.1007/s100219900037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This vision was largely a sign of the times, in particular the growing perception after the [[Second World War]] that human activities such as [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], [[industrialization]], [[pollution]], and [[overexploitation]] of [[natural resource]]s, fueled by [[exponential population growth]], were threatening to create catastrophes on a planetary scale, and has influenced many in the environmental movement since then.

===History and Relationship between Ecology and Conservation and Environmental movements===
[[environmentalism|Environmentalists]] and other [[Conservation movement|conservationists]] have used ecology and other sciences (e.g., [[climatology]]) to support their [[environmental movement|advocacy positions]]. Environmentalist views are often controversial for political or economic reasons. As a result, some scientific work in ecology directly influences policy and political debate; these in turn often direct ecological research.

The history of ecology, however, should not be conflated with that of environmental thought. Ecology as a modern science traces only from Darwin's publication of [[Origin of Species]] and Haeckel's subsequent naming of the science needed to study Darwin's theory. Awareness of humankind's effect on its environment has been traced to [[Gilbert White]] in 18th-century Selborne, England.&lt;ref name="Worster1994"/&gt; Awareness of nature and its interactions can be traced back even farther in time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esapubs.org"/&gt; Ecology before Darwin, however, is analogous to medicine prior to Pasteur's discovery of the infectious nature of disease. The history is there, but it is only partly relevant.

Neither [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] nor [[Haeckel]], it is true, did self-avowed ecological studies. The same can be said for researchers in a number of fields who contributed to ecological thought well into the 1940s without avowedly being ecologists.&lt;ref name="McIntosh1985"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Conservation and Environmental Movements - 20th Century===

When the [[Ecological Society of America]] (ESA) was chartered in 1915, it already had a conservation perspective.&lt;ref name="Robert A. Coker 1991"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human ecology had also been a visible part of the ESA at its inception, as evident by publications such as: "The Control of Pneumonia and Influenza by the Weather," "An Overlook of the Relations of Dust to Humanity," "The Ecological Relations of the Polar Eskimo," and "City Street Dust and Infectious Diseases," in early pages of Ecology and Ecological Monographs. The ESA's second president, Ellsworth Huntington, was a human ecologist. Stephen Forbes, another early president, called for "humanizing" ecology in 1921, since man was clearly the dominant species on the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This auspicious start actually was the first of a series of fitful progressions and reversions by the new science with regard to conservation. Human ecology necessarily focused on man-influenced environments and their practical problems. Ecologists in general, however, were trying to establish ecology as a basic science, one with enough prestige to make inroads into Ivy League faculties. Disturbed environments, it was thought, would not reveal nature's secrets.

Interest in the environment created by the American Dust Bowl produced a flurry of calls in 1935 for ecology to take a look at practical issues. Pioneering ecologist C. C. Adams wanted to return human ecology to the science.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; World War II, perhaps, caused the issue to be put aside.

The tension between pure ecology, seeking to understand and explain, and applied ecology, seeking to describe and repair, came to a head after World War II. Adams again tried to push the ESA into applied areas by having it raise an endowment to promote ecology. He predicted that "a great expansion of ecology" was imminent "because of its integrating tendency."&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists, however, were sensitive to the perception that ecology was still not considered a rigorous, quantitative science. Those who pushed for applied studies and active involvement in conservation were once more discreetly rebuffed. Human ecology became subsumed by sociology. It was sociologist [[Lewis Mumford]] who brought the ideas of [[George Perkins Marsh]] to modern attention in the 1955 conference, "Man‚Äôs Role in Changing the Face of the Earth." That prestigious conclave was dominated by social scientists. At it, ecology was accused of "lacking experimental methods" and neglecting "man as an ecological agent." One participant dismissed ecology as "archaic and sterile."&lt;ref&gt;

Coker 1991"/&gt; In 1950, the fledgling organization was renamed and incorporated as the Nature Conservancy, a name borrowed from the British government agency for the same purpose.

Two events, however, brought ecology's course back to applied problems. One was the [[Manhattan Project]]. It had become the Nuclear Energy Commission after the war. It is now the Department of Energy (DOE). Its ample budget included studies of the impacts of nuclear weapon use and production. That brought ecology to the issue, and it made a "Big Science" of it.&lt;ref name="Worster1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem science, both basic and applied, began to compete with [[theoretical ecology]] (then called evolutionary ecology and also mathematical ecology). [[Eugene Odum]], who published a very popular ecology textbook in 1953, became the champion of the ecosystem. In his publications, Odum called for ecology to have an ecosystem and applied focus.&lt;ref&gt;

The second event was the publication of [[Silent Spring]]. Rachel Carson's book brought ecology as a word and concept to the public. Her influence was instant. A study committee, prodded by the publication of the book, reported to the ESA that their science was not ready to take on the responsibility being given to it.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silent Spring was also the impetus for the environmental protection programs that were started in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and passed into law just before the first Earth Day. Ecologists‚Äô input was welcomed. Former ESA President Stanley Cain, for example, was appointed an Assistant Secretary in the Department of the Interior.

The environmental assessment requirement of the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), "legitimized ecology," in the words of one environmental lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEPA and similar state statutes, if nothing else, provided much employment for ecologists. Therein was the issue. Neither ecology nor ecologists were ready for the task. Not enough ecologists were available to work on impact assessment, outside of the DOE laboratories, leading to the rise of "instant ecologists,"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atonforest.org/HBtoESA24Mar71.htm&lt;/ref&gt; having dubious credentials and capabilities. Calls began to arise for the professionalization of ecology.

The controversy, whose history has yet to receive adequate treatment, lasted through the 1970s and 1980s, ending with a voluntary certification process by the ESA, along with lobbying arm in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;

===Roosevelt &amp; American Conservation===

Theodore Roosevelt was interested in nature from a young age. He carried his passion for nature into his political policies. Roosevelt felt it was necessary to preserve the resources of the nation and its environment. In 1902 he created the federal reclamation service, which reclaimed land for agriculture. He also created the Bureau of Forestry. This organization, headed by Gifford Pinchot, was formed to manage and maintain the nations timberlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theodore Roosevelt and the Environment|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/tr-environment/|publisher=PBS|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roosevelt signed the Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities in 1906. This act allowed for him to "declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic and scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be [[National Monument (United States)|National Monuments]]." Under this act he created up to 18 national monuments. During his presidency, Roosevelt established 51 Federal [[Bird reserve|Bird Reservations]], 4 National [[Game Preserves]], 150 [[United States National Forest|National Forest]]s, and 5 [[National Parks]]. Overall he protected over 200 million acres of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theodore Roosevelt and conservation|url=http://www.nps.gov/thro/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-and-conservation.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecology and global policy===
Ecology became a central part of the World's politics as early as 1971, [[UNESCO]] launched a research program called ''[[Man and Biosphere]]'', with the objective of increasing knowledge about the mutual relationship between humans and nature.  A few years later it defined the concept of [[Biosphere Reserve]].

In 1972, the [[United Nations]] held the first international [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Conference on the Human Environment]] in [[Stockholm]], prepared by [[Rene Dubos]] and other experts.  This conference was the origin of the phrase "[[Think Globally, Act Locally]]".  The next major events in ecology were the development of the concept of biosphere and the appearance of terms "biological diversity"‚Äîor now more commonly [[biodiversity]]‚Äîin the 1980s.  These terms were developed during the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992, where the concept of the biosphere was recognized by the major international organizations, and risks associated with reductions in biodiversity were publicly acknowledged.

Then, in 1997, the dangers the biosphere was facing were recognized all over the world at the conference  leading to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].  In particular, this conference highlighted the increasing dangers of the [[greenhouse effect]] ‚Äì related to the increasing concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere, leading to [[Climate change|global changes in climate]]. In [[Kyoto]], most of the world's nations recognized the importance of looking at ecology from a global point of view, on a worldwide scale, and to take into account the impact of humans on the Earth's environment.

[[File:MACMILLAM FORUM 020.JPG|thumb|Overinflating a [[Hot water bottle|hot-water bottle]]]]
'''Hot water bottle blowing''' is the deliberate inflation of a [[Hot water bottle|hot-water bottle]] by blowing. Air is breathed into the bottle until it stretches beyond its capacity and consequently explodes. It is a challenging feat of strength which is included in the ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. The challenge is most commonly undertaken by breathing air from the mouth, though it has also been achieved by blowing through the nose. The activity presents a potential hazard for physical injury to eyes and lungs.

==Description==
Blowing up a hot-water bottle is usually performed to impress a crowd. It requires significant [[lung volumes|lung capacity]] as well as chest and abdominal strength. It is regarded as potentially hazardous because of the risk of harm to the eyes and the possibility of the contained air rushing back into the lungs and causing damage or, reportedly, death.&lt;ref name="USAWA" /&gt; Former world record holder Brian Jackson has claimed that he knows of at least five deaths resulting from the practice, although this is unconfirmed.&lt;ref name="HuffPost" /&gt; [[Georgians|Georgian]] athlete Jemal Tkeshelashvili has demonstrated two variations on the traditional method: blowing the bottle up with his nose, and blowing one up while somebody sits on top of it.&lt;ref name="GuinnessN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; In Britain, the hot-water bottles used conform to standard [[British Standards|BS]] 1970:2006.&lt;ref name="RHR" /&gt;{{update inline|date=May 2018}}

==Records==
There are three hot-water bottle blowing records officiated by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. The "Fastest hot water bottle burst" by a male is held by Shaun Jones from the United Kingdom. He achieved a time of 6.52 seconds on the set of Italian show ''Lo Show Dei Record'' on 31 March 2011.&lt;ref name="Guinness1" /&gt; Jones also holds the record for the "Fastest time to burst three hot water bottles" setting the time of 28.82 seconds on 17 November 2011.&lt;ref name="Guinness3" /&gt; Jemal Tkeshelashvili holds the record for "Most hot water bottles burst with the nose in one minute". Tkeshelashvili successfully exploded three hot-water bottles during a live television broadcast of ''Das Sommerfest der Abenteuer'' in [[Magdeburg]], Germany, on 2 June 2012.&lt;ref name="GuinnessN" /&gt; Shaun Jones is also included in the Record Holders Republic registry as holding numerous variations of blowing up hot-water bottles, including doing so while standing on his head and while cycling at a minimum speed of {{convert|20|mph}} on a stationary bicycle.&lt;ref name="RHR" /&gt;

The '''Integrated Ocean Observing System''' ([http://www.ioos.noaa.gov/ IOOS]) is an organization of systems that routinely and continuously provides quality controlled data and information on current and future states of the [[oceans]] and [[Great Lakes]] from the global scale of ocean basins to local scales of [[coast]]al [[ecosystem]]s. It is a multidisciplinary system designed to provide data in forms and at rates required by decision makers to address seven societal goals.

IOOS is developing as a multi-scale system that incorporates two, interdependent components, a global ocean component, called the [[GOOS|Global Ocean Observing System]], with an emphasis on ocean-basin scale observations and a coastal component that focuses on local to Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) scales.
Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) in U.S. coastal waters and IOOS Regional Associations.

Many of IOOS' component regional systems are being dismantled for lack of federal funding, including the [[Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System]] [http://www.gomoos.org GoMOOS] . This has resulted in the loss of long term data sets and information used by Coast Guard search and rescue operations.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Woodard, "Uncharted Seas," ''Down East'' Magazine, May 2009; unavailable online but summary and background [http://colinwoodard.blogspot.com/2009/04/ocean-policy-gulf-of-maine-ocean.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional associations==
(shown in the figure below).The coastal component consists of Regional Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (RCOOSs) nested in a National Backbone of coastal observations. From a coastal perspective, the global ocean component is critical for providing data and information on basin scale forcings (e.g., [[ENSO]] events), as well as providing the data and information necessary to run coastal models (such as storm surge models).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocean.us/Coastal_Component  IOOS coastal components]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Polar Years''' ('''IPY''')&lt;ref&gt;Barr, Susan and L√ºdecke, Cornelia (Eds.), 2010, The History of the International Polar Years (IPYs). Series: From Pole to Pole, Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, XI, 319 pp. {{ISBN|978-3-642-12401-3}}, {{DOI|10.1007/978-3-642-12402-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipy.arcticportal.org/about-ipy/ipy-history  IPY History]&lt;/ref&gt; are collaborative, international efforts with intensive research foci on the [[polar region]]s. [[Karl Weyprecht]], an Austro-Hungarian naval officer, motivated the endeavor in 1875, but died before it first occurred in 1882‚Äì1883. Fifty years later (1932‚Äì1933) a second IPY took place. The [[International Geophysical Year]] was inspired by the IPY and was organized 75 years after the first IPY (1957‚Äì58). The fourth, and most recent, IPY covered two full annual cycles from March 2007 to March 2009.

==The First International Polar Year (1882‚Äì1883)==
The First International Polar Year was proposed by an [[Austro-Hungarian]] naval officer, [[Karl Weyprecht]], in 1875 and organized by [[Georg Neumayer]], director of the German Maritime Observatory. Rather than settling for traditional individual and national efforts, they pushed for a coordinated scientific approach to researching [[Arctic]] phenomena. Observers made coordinated geophysical measurements at multiple locations in the Arctic during the same year enabling multiple views of same phenomena, allowing broader interpretation of the available data and a validation of the results obtained.

It took seven years to organize the first IPY which had twelve participating nations: the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], and [[United States]].

The aforementioned countries operated 12 stations in the [[Arctic]] and two in the sub-[[Antarctic]]. Six additional meteorological stations were organized by [[Neumayer]] at Moravian mission stations on the east coast of Labrador. Observations focused on meteorology, geomagnetism, auroral phenomena, ocean currents, tides, structure and the motion of ice and atmospheric electricity. More than 40 meteorological observatories around the world expanded the IPY programs of observations for this period. Data and images from the first IPY have very recently been made available for browsing and downloading on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nisc.com/ipy   International Polar Year Publications Database]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/arctic-zone/ipy-1/   The First International Polar Year]&lt;/ref&gt; These records of the first IPY offer a rare glimpse of the circumpolar Arctic environment as it existed in the past and hold the potential to improve our understanding of historical climate variability and environmental change in the Arctic.

==The Second International Polar Year (1932‚Äì1933)==
The International Meteorological Organization, the predecessor of the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO), proposed and promoted the second IPY (1932‚Äì1933). Shortly after [[World War I]], mysterious behavior in [[telegraph]], [[radio]] and electric power and [[telephone]] lines convinced engineers and scientists of the fact that the electrical [[geophysics]] of the Earth needed more study. The availability of airplanes, motorized sea and land transport and new instruments like [[radiosondes]] enabled these phenomena to be investigated.

At an international conference of directors of meteorological services in Copenhagen in 1928 it was decided to undertake another intensive and coordinated international research effort focused on the polar regions during 1932‚Äì1933, the 50th anniversary of the First International Polar Year. It was also proposed to explicitly include in the plan for the second IPY the goal to investigate how observations in the polar regions could improve the accuracy of weather forecasts and the safety of air and sea transport.

Forty-four countries participated in the second IPY, which heralded advances in meteorology, magnetism, atmospheric science, and in the ‚Äúmapping‚Äù of ionospheric phenomena that advanced radio science and technology. 27 observation stations were established in the Arctic, a vast amount of data was collected and a world data center was created under the organization that eventually came to be called the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. Due to the global financial crisis (‚Äú[[The Great Depression]]‚Äù) at the time, the plan of erecting a network of stations in Antarctica had to be abandoned.

See [[International Geophysical Year]]

==The Fourth International Polar Year (2007‚Äì2008)==
[[File:IPY SPb2008 Press Conference.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Press conference IPY 2008]]
The fourth IPY&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipy.arcticportal.org/    IPY website]&lt;/ref&gt; (2007‚Äì2008) was sponsored by the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) and the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO). The [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]] (SCAR),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scar.org  SCAR website]&lt;/ref&gt; an interdisciplinary body of ICSU assumed responsibility for coordinating all IPY-related Antarctic research, and the [[International Arctic Science Committee]] (IASC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://iasc.info  IASC website]&lt;/ref&gt; an ICSU affiliate body, promoted and helped to plan the Arctic-focused IPY research. Initial planning for the fourth IPY began in 2003 under an International Planning Group (chaired by Professor [[Chris Rapley]] and Dr [[Robin Bell]]), and the organization and implementation of the main phase of this IPY took place in 2005‚Äì2009 with leadership from the newly established ICSU-WMO Joint Committee (co-chaired by Dr Michel B√©land and Dr Ian Allison, who was later replaced as co-chair by Prof. Jer√≥nimo L√≥pez-Mart√≠nez), its subcommittees and the International Programme Office (led by Dr David Carlson).

The fourth IPY comprised an intense, coordinated field campaign of observations, research, and analysis. It was the largest, most comprehensive campaign ever mounted to explore the Earth's polar regions. An estimated 50,000 researchers, local observers, educators, students and support personnel from more than 60 countries were involved in the 228 international IPY projects (170 in scientific research, one in data management, and 57 in education and outreach&lt;ref&gt;Krupnik, I., Allison, I., Bell, R., Cutler, P., Hik, D., L√≥pez-Mart√≠nez, J., Rachold, V., Sarukhanian, E. &amp; Summerhayes, C.

University of the Arctic, Rovaniemi, Finland /CCI Press (Printed Version), Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and ICSU/WMO Joint Committee for International Polar Year 2007‚Äì2008.&lt;/ref&gt;) and related national efforts. The IPY included intensive research and observation periods in the Arctic and Antarctic over a three-year timespan, which started 1 March 2007 and was formally concluded 12 June 2010 at the IPY Oslo Science Conference. However, many activities continued beyond that date. The IPY Science Program covered eleven areas: Polar atmosphere, [[Arctic ocean]], [[Southern Ocean]], [[Greenland ice sheet]] and Arctic [[glaciers]], Antarctic [[ice sheets]], [[Sub-glacial]] aquatic environments, [[Permafrost]], Earth structure and geodynamics at the poles, Polar terrestrial ecology and biodiversity, Polar societies and social processes and Human health.

===IPY Report===
In 2011 the ICSU/WMO Joint Committee for the IPY published a comprehensive summary of IPY activities entitled "Understanding Earth's Polar Challenges: International Polar Year 2007‚Äì2008".&lt;ref&gt;Krupnik, I., Allison, I., Bell, R., Cutler, P., Hik, D., L√≥pez-Mart√≠nez, J., Rachold, V., Sarukhanian, E. &amp; Summerhayes, C. Eds. 2011. [http://www.icsu.org/publications/reports-and-reviews/ipy-summary/IPY-JC-Summary-Full.pdf Understanding Earth‚Äôs Polar Challenges: International Polar Year 2007‚Äì2008]. University of the Arctic, Rovaniemi, Finland /CCI Press (Printed Version), Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and ICSU/WMO Joint Committee for International Polar Year 2007‚Äì2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
The report covers the development of IPY 2007‚Äì2008 for almost a decade, from 2001 to 2010. It comprises 38 chapters in five parts (Planning, Research, Observations, Outreach, and Legacies) and brings together hundreds of contributing authors from a wide range disciplines and more than 30 countries. This broad overview demonstrates the extensive and essential contribution made by participating nations and organizations, and provides a prospective blueprint for future polar research.

===SCAR/IASC Open Science Conference, St. Petersburg, Russia, 2008===
A joint conference organized by SCAR and IASC under the overarching theme ‚ÄúPolar Research ‚Äì Arctic and Antarctic perspectives in the International Polar Year‚Äù was held 8‚Äì11 July 2008 in [[St. Petersburg]], Russia, and brought together Arctic and Antarctic researchers as part of the fourth IPY. The four-day meeting comprised 29 sessions with over 1400 attendees, 550 oral presentations and 670 posters.

===IPY Science Conferences===

The IPY Science Conference was held 8‚Äì12 June in [[Oslo]], Norway and was organized by the WMO, ICSU, IASC and the Research Council of Norway and marked the official end of the fourth IPY.
The conference aim was to celebrate and publish early results from the International Polar Year 2007‚Äì2008 (IPY) and enable direct interaction among all IPY science cluster projects. There were over 2000 participants from over 60 countries.
[[File:IPY Montreal 2012 Opening.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Peter Harrison opens the IPY 2012 conference in Montreal]]

====Montr√©al, Canada, 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipy2012montreal.ca/  IPY Montr√©al Conference]&lt;/ref&gt;====
Building on the previous IPY Science Conference in Oslo, the IPY steering committee organized a science conference (22‚Äì27 April 2012) in [[Montr√©al]], Canada, with the theme ‚ÄòFrom knowledge to action‚Äô. This conference examined the global impact and implications of International Polar Year activities. The aim of the IPY Science Conference in 2012 was to help shape stewardship, sustainable development and environmental protection goals for the strategic and highly valued polar regions. In total the IPY 2012 conference received 2134 abstracts with contributions from over 45 countries.

===Polar Educators International&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polareducator.org/ Polar Educators International website]&lt;/ref&gt;===
An important legacy of the IPY 2012 ‚ÄúFrom Knowledge to Action‚Äù Conference and the education and outreach efforts of the International Polar Year 2007 ‚Äì 2008 was the establishment of Polar Educators International. This is a formal network of professionals involved in science education focused on promoting excellence in teaching polar science. [[Louise Huffman]], co-chair of the IPY Education and Outreach Committee was one of the founding members.

===The Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apecs.is  Association of Polar Early Career Scientists website]&lt;/ref&gt;===
The [[Association of Polar Early Career Scientists]] (APECS) was founded during the fourth IPY.

Following a meeting in Stockholm at the end of September 2007, the IPY International Youth Steering Committee (IYSC) and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) merged under a new structure while maintaining the name ‚ÄòAPECS‚Äô.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipy.arcticportal.org/images/uploads/APECS_release.pdf  APECS Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; The IPY International Youth Steering Committee (IYSC) had been established in 2004 to represent the needs of the youth during the fourth IPY, and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) had been established in 2006 to represent the needs and challenges faced by (post-)graduate students, post-docs, junior faculty, and research associates involved in polar research.

APECS aims to stimulate interdisciplinary and international research collaborations, provide opportunities for professional career development and develop effective future leaders in polar research, education and outreach. [[Jenny Baeseman]], as the Founding Director of APECS, established the organisations first international secretariat in [[Troms√∏ (city)|Troms√∏]], Norway during the IPY.

===International Polar Weeks===
In order to provide a platform for a continued focus on the polar regions, the IPY International Programme Office organised Polar Weeks with the theme ‚ÄúWhat Happens at the Poles Affects Us All‚Äù in October 2009 and March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ipy.arcticportal.org/feature/item/1113 |title=International Polar Weeks |access-date=2016-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803125042/http://ipy.arcticportal.org/feature/item/1113 |archive-date=2016-08-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twice yearly polar weeks continue to this day and are organized by APECS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apecs.is/outreach/international-polar-week.html  International Polar Week]&lt;/ref&gt; These weeks, coinciding with the polar equinoxes, are filled with outreach activities and events designed to engage school children and the wider public in polar science.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, B.

==International Polar Year Publications Database&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nisc.com/ipy   International Polar Year Publications Database]&lt;/ref&gt;==
The International Polar Year Publications Database (IPYPD) attempts to identify and describe all publications that result from, or are about, any of the four IPYs that have been undertaken so far. The IPYPD is part of the IPY Data and Information Service (IPYDIS). The IPYPD has been created by the Arctic Science and Technology Information System (ASTIS), the Cold Regions Bibliography Project (CRBP), the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] (SPRI) Library, the Discovery and Access of Historic Literature of the IPYs (DAHLI) project and NISC Export Services (NES).
As of February 2016, the database contains 6,724 records.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32325">An '''inverted repeat''' (or '''IR''') is a single stranded sequence of [[nucleotide]]s followed downstream by its [[complementarity (molecular biology)|reverse complement]].&lt;ref name="Ussery2008"&gt;{{cite book |title=Computing for Comparative Microbial Genomics: Bioinformatics for Microbiologists |chapter=Word Frequencies, Repeats, and Repeat-related Structures in Bacterial Genomes |series=Computational Biology |volume=8 |pages=133‚Äì144 |first1=David W. |last1=Ussery |first2=Trudy |last2=Wassenaar |first3=Stefano |last3=Borini |publisher=Springer |edition=1 |date=2008-12-22 |isbn=978-1-84800-254-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intervening sequence of nucleotides between the initial sequence and the reverse complement can be any length including zero.  When the intervening length is zero, the composite sequence is a [[palindromic sequence]]. For example, {{color|blue|5'---TTACGnnnnnn}}{{color|green|CGTAA---3'}} is an inverted repeat sequence.

Both inverted repeats and [[direct repeat]]s constitute types of [[Nucleic acid sequence|nucleotide sequences]] that occur repetitively. &lt;!--The [[human genome]] has many nucleotide sequences that occur repeatedly and as such, can be grouped in two simple classes: repetitive and unique sequences.&lt;ref name=Eichler /&gt;--&gt;  These [[repeated sequence (DNA)|repeated DNA sequences]] often range from a pair of nucleotides to a whole [[gene]], while the proximity of the repeat sequences varies between widely dispersed and simple [[tandemly arrayed genes|tandem arrays]].&lt;ref name=Sutherland&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=GR|author2=Richards, RI|title=Simple tandem DNA repeats and human genetic disease|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Apr 25, 1995|volume=92|issue=9|pages=3636‚Äì41|pmid=7731957|bibcode=1995PNAS...92.3636S|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.9.3636|pmc=42017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short [[tandem repeat]] sequences may exist as just a few copies in a small region to thousands of copies dispersed all over the genome of most [[eukaryotes]].&lt;ref name=VAN&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Belkum|first=A |author2=Scherer, S |author3=van Alphen, L |author4=Verbrugh, H|title=Short-sequence DNA repeats in prokaryotic genomes|journal=Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR|date=June 1998|volume=62|issue=2|pages=275‚Äì93|pmid=9618442|pmc=98915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeat sequences with about 10‚Äì100 [[base pair]]s are known as [[minisatellite]]s, while shorter repeat sequences having mostly 2‚Äì4 base pairs are known as [[microsatellites]].&lt;ref name=Ramel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramel|first=C|title=Mini- and microsatellites|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=June 1997|volume=105 Suppl 4|pages=781‚Äì9|pmid=9255562|pmc=1470042|issue=Suppl 4|doi=10.2307/3433284}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common repeats include the dinucleotide repeats, which have the [[nitrogenous base|bases]] AC on one DNA strand, and GT on the complementary strand.&lt;ref name=Sutherland /&gt; Some elements of the [[genome]] with unique sequences function as [[exons]], [[introns]] and regulatory DNA.&lt;ref name=Eichler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eichler|first=EE|title=Masquerading repeats: paralogous pitfalls of the human genome|journal=Genome Research|date=August 1998|volume=8|issue=8|pages=758‚Äì62|pmid=9724321|doi=10.1101/gr.8.8.758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the most familiar loci of the repetitive sequences are the [[centromere]], and the [[telomere]],&lt;ref name=Eichler /&gt; a large portion of the repeated sequences in the genome are found among the [[noncoding DNA]].&lt;ref name=Ramel /&gt;

Inverted repeats have a number of important biological functions.  They define the boundaries in [[transposon]]s and indicate regions capable of self-complementary [[base pairing]] (regions within a single sequence which can base pair with each other).

==Understanding inverted repeats==

===Example of an inverted repeat===
[[File:Inverted-Repeat.gif|thumb|500px|left|The 5 base-pair sequence on the left is "repeated" and "inverted" to form sequence on the right.]]

Beginning with this initial sequence:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{color|blue|5'-TTACG-3'}}

The complement created by base pairing is:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{color|green|3'-AATGC-5'}}

The reverse complement is:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{color|green|5'-CGTAA-3'}}

And, the inverted repeat sequence is:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{color|blue|5'---TTACGnnnnnn}}{{color|green|CGTAA---3'}}

"nnnnnn" represents any number of intervening nucleotides.
{{Clear}}
&lt;!--
===Direct repeat vs. inverted repeat===
A well-defined direct repeat is that which has a duplicated sequence as follows:&lt;ref name=Bissler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bissler|first=JJ|title=DNA inverted repeats and human disease.|journal=Frontiers in Bioscience|date=Mar 27, 1998|volume=3|pages=d408-18|pmid=9516381|doi=10.2741/a284}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:::{{color|blue|5¬¥ '''ACATACA'''ACATACA 3¬¥}}
:::{{color|green|3¬¥ '''TGTATGT'''TGTATGT 5¬¥}}
The nucleotide sequence written in bold characters signifies the repeated sequence.&lt;ref name=Bissler&gt;{{cite journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically, a typical direct repeat is comparable to saying "bye-bye".&lt;ref name=Bissler&gt;{{cite journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is similarity between direct and inverted repeat, or else a palindrome, with the exception of the second half of the inverted repeat positioned in the complementary strand as follows:&lt;ref name=Bissler&gt;{{cite journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:::{{color|blue|5¬¥ '''ACATACG'''CGTATGT 3¬¥}}
:::{{color|green|3¬¥ TGTATGC'''GCATACA''' 5¬¥}}
The last repeats suggest that palindromes can be related linguistically to a string of characters that reads the same in both directions, such as "level". In all, repeated sequence without the [[complementarity (molecular biology)|reverse complement]] and without inversion, is a [[direct repeat]].&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt; Based on the same initial sequence discussed above in the section titled "understanding inverted repeats", a direct repeat would be: {{color|blue|5' TTACGnnnnnnTTACG 3'}}
--&gt;

===Vs. direct repeat===
A direct repeat occurs when a sequence is repeated with the same pattern downstream.&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt;  There is no inversion and no reverse complement associated with a direct repeat. The nucleotide sequence written in bold characters signifies the repeated sequence. It may or may not have intervening nucleotides.
:::{{color|blue |5¬¥ '''TTACG'''nnnnnnTTACG 3¬¥}}
:::{{color|green|3¬¥ '''AATGC'''nnnnnnAATGC 5¬¥}}
Linguistically, a typical direct repeat is comparable to saying "bye-bye".&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt;

===Vs. palindrome===
An inverted repeat sequence with no intervening nucleotides between the initial sequence and its downstream [[complementarity (molecular biology)|reverse complement]] is a [[palindromic sequence|palindrome]].&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; EXAMPLE:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Step 1: start with an inverted repeat: {{color|blue|5' TTACGnnnnnnCGTAA 3'}}&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Step 2: remove intervening nucleotides: {{color|blue|5' TTACGCGTAA 3'}}&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This resulting sequence is palindromic because it is the reverse complement of itself.&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt;
:::{{color|blue|5' TTACGCGTAA 3'}} &amp;nbsp; test sequence (from Step 2 with intervening nucleotides removed)
:::{{color|green|3' AATGCGCATT 5'}} &amp;nbsp; complement of test sequence
:::{{color|blue|5' TTACGCGTAA 3'}} &amp;nbsp; reverse complement &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This is the same as the test sequence above, and thus, it is a palindrome.

===Origin of inverted repeats===
:This section is "under construction" and will be completed by mid-December.
--&gt;

===Conditions that favor synthesis===
The diverse genome-wide repeats are derived from [[transposable element]]s, which are now understood to "jump" about different genomic locations, without transferring their original copies.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite book|last=School|first=James D. Watson, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Tania A. Baker, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stephen P. Bell, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Alexander Gann, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Michael Levine, University of California, Berkeley, Richard Losik, Harvard University ; with Stephen C. Harrison, Harvard Medical|title=Molecular biology of the gene|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing Company|location=Boston|isbn=9780321762436|edition=Seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent shuttling of the same sequences over numerous generations ensures their multiplicity throughout the genome.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The limited [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] of the sequences between two distinct sequence elements known as [[Site-specific recombination|conservative site-specific recombination]] (CSSR) results in inversions of the DNA segment, based on the arrangement of the recombination recognition sequences on the donor DNA and recipient DNA.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Again, the orientation of two of the recombining sites within the donor DNA molecule relative to the asymmetry of the intervening DNA cleavage sequences, known as the crossover region, is pivotal to the formation of either inverted repeats or direct repeats.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Thus, recombination occurring at a pair of inverted sites will invert the DNA sequence between the two sites.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; &lt;!--Very stable chromosomes have been observed with a comparatively fewer number of inverted repeats than direct repeats, suggesting a relationship between the stability of and the number of  repeats.--&gt;Very stable chromosomes have been observed with comparatively fewer numbers of inverted repeats than direct repeats, suggesting a relationship between chromosome stability and the number of repeats.&lt;ref name=Achaz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Achaz|first=G|author2=Coissac, E |author3=Netter, P |author4= Rocha, EP |title=Associations between inverted repeats and the structural evolution of bacterial genomes|journal=Genetics|date=August 2003|volume=164|issue=4|pages=1279‚Äì89|pmid=12930739|pmc=1462642}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
===Most common biological functions using Inverted Repeats===
:This section is "under construction" and will be completed by mid-December.
--&gt;

===Regions where presence is obligatory===
Terminal inverted repeats have been observed in the DNA of various eukaryotic transposons, even though their source remains unknown.&lt;ref name=Zhang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=HH|author2=Xu, HE |author3=Shen, YH |author4=Han, MJ |author5= Zhang, Z |title=The Origin and Evolution of Six Miniature Inverted-Repeat Transposable Elements in Bombyx mori and Rhodnius prolixus|journal=Genome Biology and Evolution|date=January 2013|volume=5|issue=11|pages=2020‚Äì31|pmid=24115603|doi=10.1093/gbe/evt153 |pmc=3845634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inverted repeats are principally found at the origins of replication of cell organism and organelles that range from phage plasmids, mitochondria, and eukaryotic viruses to mammalian cells.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=CE|author2=Zorbas, H |author3=Price, GB |author4= Zannis-Hadjopoulos, M |title=Inverted repeats, stem-loops, and cruciforms: significance for initiation of DNA replication|journal=Journal of Cellular Biochemistry|date=October 1996|volume=63|issue=1|pages=1‚Äì22|pmid=8891900|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(199610)63:1&lt;1::AID-JCB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replication origins of the phage G4 and other related phages comprise a segment of nearly 139 nucleotide bases that include three inverted repeats that are essential for replication priming.&lt;ref name=Pearson /&gt;

===In the genome===
To a large extent, portions of nucleotide repeats are quite often observed as part of rare DNA combinations.&lt;ref name=Heringa /&gt; The three main repeats which are largely found in particular DNA constructs include the closely precise homopurine-homopyrimidine inverted repeats, which is otherwise referred to as H palindromes, a common occurrence in triple helical H conformations that may comprise either the TAT or CGC nucleotide triads. The others could be described as long inverted repeats having the tendency to produce hairpins and cruciform, and finally direct tandem repeats, which commonly exist in structures described as slipped-loop, cruciform and left-handed Z-DNA.&lt;ref name=Heringa /&gt;

===Common in different organisms===
Past studies suggest that repeats are a common feature of [[eukaryotes]] unlike the [[prokaryotes]] and [[archaea]].&lt;ref name=Heringa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heringa|first=J|title=Detection of internal repeats: how common are they?|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|date=June 1998|volume=8|issue=3|pages=338‚Äì45|pmid=9666330|doi=10.1016/S0959-440X(98)80068-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports suggest that irrespective of the comparative shortage of repeat elements in prokaryotic genomes, they nevertheless contain hundreds or even thousands of large repeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Treangen|first=TJ|author2=Abraham, AL |author3=Touchon, M |author4= Rocha, EP |title=Genesis, effects and fates of repeats in prokaryotic genomes|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|date=May 2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=539‚Äì71|pmid=19396957|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2009.00169.x|url=https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article-pdf/33/3/539/18141891/33-3-539.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Current genomic analysis seem to suggest the existence of a large excess of perfect inverted repeats in many prokaryotic genomes as compared to eukaryotic genomes.&lt;ref name=Ladoukakis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladoukakis|first=ED|author2=Eyre-Walker, A|title=The excess of small inverted repeats in prokaryotes|journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution|date=September 2008|volume=67|issue=3|pages=291‚Äì300|pmid=18696026|doi=10.1007/s00239-008-9151-z|url=http://www.lifesci.susx.ac.uk/home/Adam_Eyre-Walker/Website/Publications_files/LadoukakisJME08.pdf|bibcode=2008JMolE..67..291L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently (2017) was found that inverted repeats are present in DNA of all mitochondrial and plastid genomes sequenced so far and are enriched especially in important regulatory regions like replication origin and D-loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cechova|first=J|author2=Lysek, J |author3=Bartas, M |author4= Brazda, V |title=Complex analyses of inverted repeats in mitochondrial genomes revealed their importance and variability|journal=Bioinformatics|date=November 2017|volume=34|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btx729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brazda|first=V|author2=Lysek, J |author3=Bartas, M |author4= Fojta, M |title=Complex Analyses of Short Inverted Repeats in All Sequenced Chloroplast DNAs|journal=BioMed Research International|date=July 2018|volume=2018|doi=10.1155/2018/1097018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For quantification and comparison of inverted repeats between several species, namely on archaea, see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hosseini|first=M|author2=Pratas, D |author3=Pinho, AJ |title=On the Role of Inverted Repeats in DNA Sequence Similarity|journal=11th International Conference on Practical Applications of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics.

===Inverted repeats in pseudoknots===
[[Pseudoknot]]s are common structural motifs found in RNA.  They are formed by two nested [[stem-loop]]s such that the stem of one structure is formed from the loop of the other.  There are multiple folding [[topology|topologies]] among pseudoknots and great variation in loop lengths, making them a structurally diverse group.&lt;ref name=Staple&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staple|first=DW|author2=Butcher, SE|title=Pseudoknots: RNA structures with diverse functions.|journal=PLoS Biology|date=June 2005|volume=3|issue=6|pages=e213|pmid=15941360|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030213|pmc=1149493}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inverted repeats are a key component of pseudoknots as can be seen in the illustration of a naturally occurring pseudoknot found in the human [[telomerase RNA component]].&lt;ref name=chen-greider&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=JL|author2=Greider, CW|title=Functional analysis of the pseudoknot structure in human telomerase RNA.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Jun 7, 2005|volume=102|issue=23|pages=8080‚Äì5; discussion 8077‚Äì9|pmid=15849264|doi=10.1073/pnas.0502259102|pmc=1149427|bibcode=2005PNAS..102.8080C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four different sets of inverted repeats are involved in this structure.  Sets 1 and 2 are the stem of stem-loop A and are part of the loop for stem-loop B.  Similarly, sets 3 and 4 are the stem for stem-loop B and are part of the loop for stem-loop A.

Pseudoknots play a number of different roles in biology.  The telomerase pseudoknot in the illustration is critical to that enzyme's activity.&lt;ref name=chen-greider /&gt;  The [[ribozyme]] for the [[Hepatitis D|''hepatitis delta virus (HDV)'']] folds into a double-pseudoknot structure and self-cleaves its circular genome to produce a single-genome-length RNA.  Pseudoknots also play a role in programmed [[ribosomal frameshift]]ing found in some viruses and required in the replication of [[retroviruses]].&lt;ref name=Staple /&gt;{{Clear}}

===In riboswitches===
Inverted repeats play an important role in [[riboswitch]]es, which are RNA regulatory elements that control the expression of genes that produce the mRNA, of which they are part.&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt;  A simplified example of the [[flavin mononucleotide]] (FMN) riboswitch is shown in the illustration. This riboswitch exists in the [[mRNA]] transcript and has several [[stem-loop]] structures upstream from the [[coding region]].  However, only the key stem-loops are shown in the illustration, which has been greatly simplified to help show the role of the inverted repeats.  There are multiple inverted repeats in this riboswitch as indicated in green (yellow background) and blue (orange background). [[File:Ribo100r.gif|thumb|800 px|left]]
{{Clear}}
In the absence of FMN, the Anti-termination structure is the preferred [[Conformation activity relationship|conformation]] for the mRNA transcript. It is created by base-pairing of the inverted repeat region circled in red.  When FMN is present, it may bind to the loop and prevent formation of the Anti-termination structure.  This allows two different sets of inverted repeats to base-pair and form the Termination structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winkler|first=WC|author2=Cohen-Chalamish, S |author3=Breaker, RR |title=An mRNA structure that controls gene expression by binding FMN.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Dec 10, 2002|volume=99|issue=25|pages=15908‚Äì13|pmid=12456892|doi=10.1073/pnas.212628899|pmc=138538|bibcode=2002PNAS...9915908W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stem-loop on the 3' end is a [[Terminator (genetics)|transcriptional terminator]] because the sequence immediately following it is a string of uracils (U).  If this stem-loop forms (due to the presence of FMN) as the growing RNA strand emerges from the [[RNA polymerase]] complex, it will create enough structural tension to cause the RNA strand to dissociate and thus terminate transcription.  The dissociation occurs easily because the base-pairing between the U's in the RNA and the A's in the template strand are the weakest of all base-pairings.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;  Thus, at higher concentration levels, FMN down-regulates its own transcription by increasing the formation of the termination structure.

==Mutations and disease==
Inverted repeats are often described as "hotspots" of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomic instability.&lt;ref name=Voineagu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mirkin|first=I|author2=Narayanan, V |author3=Lobachev, KS |author4= Mirkin, SM |title=Replication stalling at unstable inverted repeats: interplay between DNA hairpins and fork stabilizing proteins|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Jul 22, 2008|volume=105|issue=29|pages=9936‚Äì41|pmid=18632578|bibcode=2008PNAS..105.9936V|doi=10.1073/pnas.0804510105|pmc=2481305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long inverted repeats are deemed to greatly influence the stability of the genome of various organisms.&lt;ref name=Zhao&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stormo|first=G|author2=Chang, KY |author3=Varley, K |author4= Stormo, GD |title=Evidence for active maintenance of inverted repeat structures identified by a comparative genomic approach|journal=PLoS ONE|date=Feb 28, 2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e262|pmid=17327921|bibcode=2007PLoSO...2..262Z|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000262|pmc=1803023|editor1-last=Hall|editor1-first=Neil}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is exemplified in ''E. coli'', where genomic sequences with long inverted repeats are seldom replicated, but rather deleted with rapidity.&lt;ref name=Zhao /&gt; Again, the long inverted repeats observed in yeast greatly favor recombination within the same and adjacent chromosomes, resulting in an equally very high rate of deletion.&lt;ref name=Zhao /&gt; Finally, a very high rate of deletion and recombination were also observed in mammalian chromosomes regions with inverted repeats.&lt;ref name=Zhao /&gt; Reported differences in the stability of genomes of interrelated organisms are always an indication of a disparity in inverted repeats.&lt;ref name=Achaz /&gt; The instability results from the tendency of inverted repeats to fold into hairpin- or cruciform-like DNA structures. These special structures can hinder or confuse DNA replication and other genomic activities.&lt;ref name=Voineagu /&gt; Thus, inverted repeats lead to special configurations in both [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] that can ultimately cause [[mutation]]s and [[disease]].&lt;ref name=bissler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bissler|first=JJ|title=DNA inverted repeats and human disease|journal=Frontiers in Bioscience|date=Mar 27, 1998|volume=3|pages=d408‚Äì18|pmid=9516381|doi=10.2741/a284}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DNA palindrome.svg|thumb|600 px|left|Inverted repeat changing to/from an extruded cruciform. &amp;nbsp; A: Inverted Repeat Sequences; &amp;nbsp; B: Loop; &amp;nbsp; C: Stem with base pairing of the inverted repeat sequences]]
The illustration shows an inverted repeat undergoing cruciform extrusion. DNA in the region of the inverted repeat unwinds and then recombines, forming a four-way junction with two [[stem-loop]] structures. The cruciform structure occurs because the inverted repeat sequences self-pair to each other on their own strand.&lt;ref name=ramreddy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramreddy|first=T|author2=Sachidanandam, R |author3=Strick, TR |title=Real-time detection of cruciform extrusion by single-molecule DNA nanomanipulation|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=May 2011|volume=39|issue=10|pages=4275‚Äì83|pmid=21266478|doi=10.1093/nar/gkr008|pmc=3105387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extruded cruciforms can lead to [[frameshift mutation]]s when a DNA sequence has inverted repeats in the form of a [[palindromic sequence|palindrome]] combined with regions of [[direct repeat]]s on either side. During [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], slippage and partial dissociation of the polymerase from the template strand can lead to both [[deletion (genetics)|deletion]] and [[insertion (genetics)|insertion]] mutations.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;  Deletion occurs when a portion of the unwound [[template strand]] forms a stem-loop that gets "skipped" by the transcription machinery. Insertion occurs when a stem-loop forms in a dissociated portion of the nascent (newly synthesized) strand causing a portion of the template strand to be transcribed twice.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;

=== Antithrombin deficiency from a point mutation ===
Imperfect inverted repeats can lead to [[mutation]]s through intrastrand and interstrand switching.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;  The [[antithrombin]] III gene's coding region is an example of an imperfect inverted repeat as shown in the figure on the right.
The [[stem-loop]] structure forms with a bump at the bottom because the G and T do not pair up. A strand switch event could result in the G (in the bump) being replaced by an A which removes the "imperfection" in the inverted repeat and provides a stronger stem-loop structure. However, the replacement also creates a [[point mutation]] converting the GCA codon to ACA. If the strand switch event is followed by a second round of [[DNA replication]], the mutation may become fixed in the [[genome]] and lead to disease. Specifically, the [[missense mutation]] would lead to a defective gene and a deficiency in antithrombin which could result in the development of [[venous thromboembolism]] (blood clots within a vein).&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;

=== Osteogenesis imperfecta from a frameshift mutation ===
Mutations in the [[collagen]] gene can lead to the disease [[Osteogenesis Imperfecta]], which is characterized by brittle bones.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt; In the illustration, a stem-loop formed from an imperfect inverted repeat is mutated with a thymine (T) nucleotide insertion as a result of an inter- or intrastrand switch. The addition of the T creates a [[base-pairing]] "match up" with the adenine (A) that was previously a "bump" on the left side of the stem. While this addition makes the stem stronger and perfects the inverted repeat, it also creates a [[frameshift mutation]] in the nucleotide sequence which alters the [[reading frame]] and will result in an incorrect expression of the gene.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;

== History ==
The record of noodles can be found in documents of the [[Goryeo]] era, but the descriptions are vague and the nature of the noodles isn't clear. In the 12th century document ''Goryeo dogyeong'' (hangul:Í≥†Î†§ÎèÑÍ≤Ω, hanja:È´òÈ∫óÂúñÁ∂ì) it is mentioned that noodles were only eaten on special occasions, as wheat flour was very expensive, being imported from [[China]]. A cooking description can be found in a later document, ''The Best New Cooking Methods of Joseon'' (hangul:Ï°∞ÏÑ†Î¨¥ÏåçÏã†ÏãùÏöîÎ¶¨Ï†úÎ≤ï, hanja:ÊúùÈÆÆÁÑ°ÈõôÊñ∞ÂºèÊñôÁêÜË£ΩÊ≥ï), written in 1924. In the 1934 book ''Simple Joseon Cooking'' (hangul:, hanja:), the recipe calls for the noodles to be boiled and rinsed in cold water before adding broth and [[Garnish (food)|garnish]], a method that differs from the modern version of boiling the noodles together with the broth.&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=263426&amp;v=44 Kalguksu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610014709/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=263426&amp;v=44 |date=2011-06-10 }} at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preparation and serving ==
The noodles are made with dough from wheat flour and [[Egg (food)|eggs]], and sometimes ground bean powder is added for texture. The dough is let to breathe, then rolled out thinly and cut in long strips. The [[broth]] for ''kalguksu'' is usually made with dried [[Anchovy|anchovies]], [[shellfish]], and [[kelp]]. Sometimes chicken broth would be used. In order to obtain a rich flavor, the ingredients are simmered for many hours. The noodles and various vegetables, most often [[Korean zucchini]], [[potato]]es, and [[scallion]]s are added and boiled together. Usually seasoned with salt, the noodles are served with garnish of choice.&lt;ref name="kalguksu doosan"/&gt;

In 1539 Hampton Court Chase was created an 'Honour' by an [[Act of Parliament]] instigated by [[Henry VIII]] and passed as a public act by approval of Parliament and the King. The title holder increasingly over time referred to as '''Ranger''' or '''Keeper of Bushey Park''' held as his domain the right to build and rebuild a grand house in Bushy Park coupled with a degree of local power and exercise likewise to the monarch in hunting rights.&lt;ref name=page/&gt; Henry thereby created the first forest since the [[New Forest]] of William the Conqueror and obtained the rights to a share of cattle and game in the extent to append to his "close park" to Hampton Court Palace taken from [[Cardinal Wolsey|Wolsey]]. The area's other local landowners included principally manorial tenants of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|confiscated]] [[Chertsey Abbey|Chertsey]] and [[Westminster Abbey]]s &amp;ndash; and made all non-[[Chase (land)|mete]] parts an overall chase for royal and official hunting parties for [[wild boar|boar]], game birds, [[hare]], [[Rabbit|coneys]] and deer.&lt;ref name=ecook/&gt;{{refn|group=n|In the era in which the Chase was founded many private land interests 'escheated to' (owners failed to pay a relief to effect [[livery of seisin]] after [[inquisitions post mortem]]); 'were surrendered to' (were purchased by); or were forfeited by attainder/were among attainted estates (see [[attainder]]) to the Crown (monarch).}}  Holding all persons to account for animal grazing and wood-taking financially were added benefits.&lt;ref name=ecook/&gt; The statute set up a new forest or chase for the king, to be called 'Hampton Court Chase' but which was smaller than the many square miles the King wished:{{quote|But it plainly appeareth both by the kings...indenture [...of first October 1537...(legal deed)], and by the judgement of the whole parliament that the king could neither erect any chase or forest over any mans grounds without their consent and agreement.|Sir [[Edward Coke]], Fourth Part: [[Institutes of the Lawes of England]] published 1644|&lt;ref name=ecook&gt;

The bounds of the chase apart from Bushy Park took in the manors of [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], [[Hanworth]], [[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton]], [[Walton-on-Thames]]. Parliament, through the courts, was deemed to have strongly curtailed its royal forest rights so as not to impinge on freeholds nor main customary tenants lands in [[Molesey]], [[Weybridge]], [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]] and part of [[Esher]], its furthest reach due to Henry's legal deed (indenture) of 1537.&lt;ref name=ecook/&gt;

The Ranger or Keeper in early years held the position of '''Housekeeper of the [[Hampton Court Palace|Palace]]'''. The rangership of the land in the bend of the river east of the Palace, the 'House' or 'Home' Park was usually separate.&lt;ref name=page/&gt; [[Christopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey|Kit Villiers]], an ennobled courtier by James I, inherited the honour from his brother and took as his official seat Ashley House (and [[Ashley Park]]) in [[Walton on Thames]].  Reinstatement in wealth and titles to the Villiers (Earls of Jersey and Anglesey) family after the [[English Civil War]] failed to reunite the more southerly lands associated with the honour which were taken and sold in the course of the 1649-1660 [[Commonwealth of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parishes: Walton on Thames, A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3 |year=1911|pages= 467‚Äì475|url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43009 |accessdate= 27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some holders of the title lived in Bushy Park seasonally or as their main home. The monarch tended to grant the title to the main heir of the previous holder.  Parliament in the English Interregnum granted the title to General Monck, who remained in favour in the [[English Restoration]].

'''''List of Recent Holarctic Bird Species''''' is a 1977 book by [[Karel H. Voous]], published by the [[British Ornithologists' Union]]. It contains a list of 1,921 bird species recorded from the [[Holarctic]] [[zoogeographic region]]. It was widely adopted by ornithologists in Europe as a standard baseline list. It was originally published in two parts in the BOU's journal [[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]]: that covering the [[non-passerines]] in 1973, and the [[passerine]] part in 1977. The list has been reprinted twice, in 1980 and 1991. It contains a foreword by [[Sir Hugh Elliott]].

==Geographical scope==
In the western [[Palearctic]] region, the list adopts the same geographical limits as those used by the editors of the [[ornithological handbook|handbook]] ''[[The Birds of the Western Palearctic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cramp, Stanley]] ''et al.'' (1977-1994) ''[[Handbook of the Birds of Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa: The Birds of the Western Palearctic]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The whole of the [[Arabian peninsula]] and [[Iran]] are also included; further east, Voous followed the boundaries used by [[Ernst Hartert|Hartert]] (1903‚Äì1923) &lt;ref&gt;[[Hartert, Ernst]] (1903-23) ''[[Die V√∂gel der pal√§arktischen Fauna]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Vaurie|Vaurie]] (1959, 1965).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vaurie, Charles]] (1959, 1965) ''[[The birds of the Palearctic fauna]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Nearctic]] region, the list covers all of the continental U.S. and Canada, the [[Bahama Islands]], plus the non-tropical parts of [[Mexico]] (defined as the states of [[Baja California]], [[Sonora]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Durango]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Aguascalientes]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Quer√©taro]], [[Mexico State|M√©xico]], [[Mexican Federal District|Distrito Federal]], [[Coahuila]] and [[Nuevo Le√≥n]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Voous, K.

Dzhakishev graduated from the [[Moscow Engineering Physics Institute]] in 1986, majoring in the Physics of Solid Bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touchbriefings.com/pdf/2402/mirshanov.pdf Kazakhstan ‚Äì Set to Become the World‚Äôs Number One Uranium Producer] Touch Briefings&lt;/ref&gt; He remained there until 1990 to complete post-graduate work.

The primary candidates for non-cellular life are viruses. A minority of biologists consider viruses to be living [[organism]]s, but most do not.

Engineers sometimes use the term "[[artificial life]]" to refer to [[software]] and [[robot]]s inspired by biological processes, but these do not satisfy any biological definition of life.

== Viruses as non-cellular life ==
{{Life timeline}}{{Further|Virus|Girus|Viral evolution}}
The nature of viruses was unclear for many years following their discovery as [[pathogen]]s. They were described as [[poison]]s or [[toxin]]s at first, then as "infectious proteins", but with advances in microbiology it became clear that they also possessed [[genetic material]], a defined structure, and the ability to spontaneously assemble from their constituent parts. This spurred extensive debate as to whether they should be regarded as fundamentally organic or inorganic ‚Äî as very small biological [[organism]]s or very large biochemical [[molecule]]s ‚Äî and since the 1950s many scientists have thought of viruses as existing at the border between chemistry and life; a gray area between living and nonliving.&lt;ref name="Villarreal 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forterre 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lwoff|first=A.|date=1957-01-01|title=The Concept of Virus|url=http://mic.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/00221287-17-2-239;jsessionid=j7YU0LkUikNMC-na5q7Hg5R8.x-sgm-live-02|journal=Microbiology|volume=17|issue=2|pages=239‚Äì253|doi=10.1099/00221287-17-2-239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent discovery of [[giant viruses]] (aka giruses, [[nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses]], NCLDVs) has reignited this debate, since they are not only physically larger than previously known viruses, but also possess much more extensive [[genome]]s, including [[gene]]s coding for [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]]s, key proteins involved in [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which were previously thought to be exclusive to cellular organisms. This raises the prospect that the giant viruses may have had extinct ancestors (or even undiscovered ones) capable of engaging in life processes (such as [[evolution]] and [[Self-replication|replication]]) independent of cells, and that modern viruses lost those abilities [[Secondary loss|secondarily]]. The viral lineage including this ancestor would be ancient and may have originated alongside the earliest [[archaea]] or before the [[Last universal common ancestor|LUCA]]. If such a virus is discovered, or its past existence supported by further genetic evidence, most biologists agree that it would constitute a ''bona fide'' lifeform, and its descendants (at least the giant viruses, and possibly including all known viruses) could be [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] classified in a fourth [[Domain (biology)|domain]] of life. Discovery of the [[pandoravirus]]es, with genomes are even larger than the other giant viruses and exhibiting particularly low [[Homology (biology)|homology]] with the three existing domains, further discredited the traditional view that viruses simply "pick-pocketed" all of their genes from cellular organisms, and further supported the "complex ancestors" hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Villarreal 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/science/changing-view-on-viruses-not-so-small-after-all.html|title=Changing View on Viruses: Not So Small After All|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|date=2013-07-18|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nasir|first=Arshan|last2=Kim|first2=Kyung Mo|last3=Caetano-Anolles|first3=Gustavo|date=2012-08-24|title=Giant viruses coexisted with the cellular ancestors and represent a distinct supergroup along with superkingdoms Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=12|pages=156|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-12-156|issn=1471-2148|pmc=3570343|pmid=22920653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing research is being conducted in this area, using techniques such as [[phylogenetic bracketing]] on the giant viruses to infer characteristics of their proposed progenitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colson|first=Philippe|last2=Gimenez|first2=Gregory|last3=Boyer|first3=Micka√´l|last4=Fournous|first4=Ghislain|last5=Raoult|first5=Didier|date=2011-04-29|title=The giant Cafeteria roenbergensis virus that infects a widespread marine phagocytic protist is a new member of the fourth domain of Life |journal=PLoS One|volume=6|issue=4|pages=e18935|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0018935|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3084725|pmid=21559486|bibcode=2011PLoSO...618935C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[Viral replication]] and self-assembly has implications for the study of the [[abiogenesis|origin of life]],&lt;ref name="pmid16984643"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koonin EV |author2=Senkevich TG |author3=Dolja VV |title=The ancient Virus World and evolution of cells |journal=Biol.

== Viroids ==
{{Main|Viroid}}
Viroids are the smallest infectious pathogens known to biologists, consisting solely of short strands of circular, single-stranded RNA without protein coats. They are mostly plant pathogens and some are animal pathogens, from which some are of commercial importance. Viroid genomes are extremely small in size, ranging from 246 to 467 nucleobases. In comparison, the genome of the smallest known viruses capable of causing an infection by themselves are around 2,000 nucleobases in size. Viroids are the first known representatives of a new biological realm of sub-viral pathogens.&lt;ref name="pmid5095900"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diener TO | title = Potato spindle tuber "virus".

Some viroids are [[ribozymes]], having catalytic properties which allow self-cleavage and ligation of unit-size genomes from larger replication intermediates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=593‚Äì8|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400706|pmid=16741503|pmc=1479586|year=2006|author1=Dar√≤s|first1=J.

== Taxonomy ==
In discussing the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[domain (biology)|domains]] of life, the terms "Acytota" or "Aphanobionta" are occasionally used as the name of a [[virus|viral]] [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], domain, or [[empire (biology)|empire]]. The corresponding [[cellular life]] name would be [[Cytota]]. Non-cellular organisms and cellular life would be the two top-level subdivisions of life, whereby life as a whole would be known as organisms, [[Nature|Naturae]], or [[Vitae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Crucial steps to life: From chemical reactions to code using agents|journal=Biosystems|volume=140|pages=49‚Äì57|doi=10.1016/j.biosystems.2015.12.007|pmid=26723230|author1=Witzany|first1=G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taxon Cytota would include three top-level subdivisions of its own, the domains [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]], and [[Eukarya]].

*Oenoe, an [[Arcadia]]n [[nymph]], one of the nurses of infant [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 8. 47. 3&lt;/ref&gt; She is probably the same as Oenoe, possible mother of [[Pan (god)|Pan]] by [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Euripides]], ''[[Rhesus (play)|Rhesus]]'', 36&lt;/ref&gt; and Oeneis, also a possible mother of Pan, this time by Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Theocritus]], Idyll 1. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
*Oenoe, an impious [[Pygmy]] woman, wife of [[Nicodamas]] and mother of [[Mopsus]].

The '''Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge''' is a 402,000&amp;#8209;acre (1,627&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) [[National Wildlife Refuge]] located in [[Charlton County, Georgia|Charlton]], [[Ware County, Georgia|Ware]], and [[Clinch County, Georgia|Clinch]] Counties of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Baker County, Florida|Baker County]] in [[Florida]], United States. The refuge is administered from offices in [[Folkston, Georgia]]. The refuge was established in 1937 to protect a majority of the 438,000&amp;nbsp;acre (1,772&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) [[Okefenokee Swamp]].&lt;ref name="fedreg"&gt;Federal Register Volume 70, No. 147, pp. 44355‚Äì44357 ‚Äì Tuesday August 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, [http://www.fws.gov/okefenokee Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge], URL retrieved June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Okefenokee" is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] word meaning "trembling earth."&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, [http://www.fws.gov/southeast/pubs/facts/okfcon.pdf Refuge Overview], ''Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge'', .pdf, URL retrieved June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[wildfire]] which began with a lightning strike near the center of the Refuge on May 5, 2007 eventually merged with another wildfire which had begun near [[Waycross, Georgia]] on April 16 due to a tree falling on a power line. By May 28, more than {{convert|580000|acre|km2}} had burned in the region, or more than 900 square miles (2300&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). [http://www.gatrees.org/] [https://web.archive.org/web/20110524085018/http://www.news4jax.com/news4georgia/13390665/detail.html]

Nearly 400,000 people visit the refuge each year, making it the 16th most visited refuge in the [[National Wildlife Refuge System]].&lt;ref name="fedreg"/&gt; It is the largest in acreage of any that is not located in a western state. In 1999, the economic impact of tourism in [[Charlton County, Georgia|Charlton]], [[Ware County, Georgia|Ware]], and [[Clinch County, Georgia|Clinch]] Counties in Georgia exceeded $67 million.&lt;ref name="fedreg"/&gt; The refuge has a staff of 16 with a fiscal year 2005 budget of $1,451,000.&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt; The refuge also administers the [[Banks Lake National Wildlife Refuge]].

==History==
[[Image:OkefenokeeNWR1.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge]]
The swamp has a rich human history including Native American settlement, explorations by [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]], a massive drainage attempt, and intensive [[logging|timber harvesting]].

Native Americans inhabited [[Okefenokee Swamp]] as early as 2500 BC.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/okefenokee/refugehistory.htm http://www.fws.gov/okefenokee/refugehistory.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225112007/http://www.fws.gov/okefenokee/refugehistory.htm |date=February 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peoples of the Deptford Culture, the [[Swift Creek Culture]] and the [[Weeden Island Culture]] occupied sites within the Okefenokee.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The last tribe to seek sanctuary in the swamp were the [[Seminole]]s.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Troops led by General [[Charles R. Floyd]] during the [[Second Seminole War]], 1838‚Äì1842, ended the age of the Native Americans in the Okefenokee.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The [[Suwannee Canal]] Company purchased 238,120&amp;nbsp;acres (963&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of the Okefenokee Swamp from the State of Georgia in 1891 to drain the swamp for rice, sugar cane, and cotton plantations.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; When this failed, the company began industrial wetland logging as a source of income.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Captain Henry Jackson and his crews spent three years digging the Suwannee Canal 11.5&amp;nbsp;miles (18.5&amp;nbsp;km) into the swamp.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Economic recessions led to the company's bankruptcy and eventual sale to Charles Hebard in 1901.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Logging operations, focusing on the cypress, began in 1909 after a railroad was constructed on the northwest area of the swamp.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; More than 431 million board feet (1,020,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of timber were removed from the Okefenokee by 1927, when logging operations ceased.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The ''Okefenokee Preservation Society'', formed in 1918, promoted nationwide interest in the swamp.&lt;ref name="fedreg"/&gt; With the support of State and local interests and numerous conservation and scientific organizations, the Federal Government acquired most of the swamp for refuge purposes in 1936.&lt;ref name="fedreg"/&gt;

In 1937, with Executive Order 7593 (later amended by Executive Order 7994), President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] established the refuge, designating it as "a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife." &lt;ref name="fedreg"/&gt; The establishment of Okefenokee Refuge in 1937 marked the culmination of a movement that had been initiated at least 25 years earlier by a group of scientists from [[Cornell University]] who recognized the educational, scientific, and recreational values of this unique area.&lt;ref name="fedreg"/&gt;

In 1974, to further ensure the protection of this unique ecosystem, the interior sections of the refuge were designated a [[National Wilderness Preservation System|National Wilderness Area]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1986, the Okefenokee Refuge was designated by the [[Ramsar Convention|Wetlands Convention]] as a [[Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance|Wetland of International Importance]].&lt;ref name="fedreg"/&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:Okefenokee-map.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Map of Okefenokee NWR]]
Okefenokee NWR has an approved acquisition boundary of 519,480&amp;nbsp;acres (2,102&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which is 123,480&amp;nbsp;acres (500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) larger than its current area.&lt;ref name="fedreg"/&gt; Approximately 371,000&amp;nbsp;acres (1,500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of the [[Okefenokee Swamp]] wetlands are incorporated into the refuge. 353,981&amp;nbsp;acres (1,432&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) within the swamp were designated as the [[Okefenokee Wilderness]], a part of the [[National Wilderness Preservation System]] when the Okefenokee Wilderness Act was passed in 1974, making it the third largest [[wilderness]] east of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref name="fedreg"/&gt;

The Okefenokee Swamp is a vast [[bog]] inside a huge, saucer-shaped depression that was once part of the [[seabed|ocean floor]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The swamp now lies 103 to {{convert|128|ft|m}} above mean [[sea level]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; [[Peat]] deposits, up to {{convert|15|ft|m}} thick, cover much of the swamp floor.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; These deposits are so unstable in spots that trees and surrounding bushes tremble by stomping the surface.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Native Americans named the area "Okefenokee" meaning "Land of the Trembling Earth".&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Swamp habitats include open wet "[[prairie]]s", [[Taxodium|cypress forest]]s, [[Scrubland|scrub-shrub vegetation]], upland islands, and open lakes.&lt;ref name="NWRprofile"&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/Refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=41590 http://www.fws.gov/Refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=41590]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Okefenokee Swamp is one of the world's largest intact freshwater ecosystems.&lt;ref name="NWRprofile"/&gt; It has been designated a Wetland of International Importance by the United Nations under the Ramsar Convention of 1971.&lt;ref name="NWRprofile"/&gt; The swamp is compared through research to wetlands worldwide.&lt;ref name="NWRprofile"/&gt; It is world-renowned for its amphibian populations that are bio-indicators of global health. Water from the [[Suwannee River]] [[Sill (geology)|Sill area]] is used as a standard reference by scientists throughout the world.&lt;ref name="NWRprofile"/&gt;

The slow-moving waters of the Okefenokee are tea-colored due to the [[tannic acid]] released from decaying vegetation.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The principal outlet of the swamp, the [[Suwannee River]], originates in the heart of the Okefenokee and drains southwest into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The swamp's southeastern drainage to the Atlantic Ocean is the [[St. Marys River (Florida/Georgia)|St. Mary's River]], which forms the boundary between Georgia and Florida.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The swamp contains numerous islands and lakes, along with vast areas of non-forested habitat.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; [[Prairie]]s cover about 60,000 acres (240&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of the swamp.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Once forested, these expanses of marsh were created during periods of severe drought when fires burned out vegetation and the top layers of peat.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The prairies harbor a variety of wading birds: herons, egrets, ibises, cranes, and bitterns.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;
[[Image:Okefenokee burn1.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Controlled burn at Okefenokee NWR]]
Refuge staff manages 33,000 acres (130&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of [[upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)|uplands]] which are being restored to once-abundant [[longleaf pine]] and [[three-awn|wiregrass habitat]].&lt;ref name="NWRprofile"/&gt;

Refuge staff and volunteers work to preserve the natural qualities of the swamp, provide habitat for a variety of wildlife, and provide recreational opportunities for visitors.&lt;ref name="NWRprofile"/&gt; They also conduct [[prescribed burn]]s in upland areas, [[thinning|thin forests]], create wildlife openings, plant longleaf pines, and monitor, manage, and improve wildlife populations and habitat.&lt;ref name="NWRprofile"/&gt;

The Okefenokee is a [[rainfall]]-dependent system, and when periods of [[drought]] occur, the area becomes susceptible to [[wildfire]].&lt;ref name="AFM.pdf"&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/okefenokee/okefenokee_amphib_fish_mam_rep98.pdf http://www.fws.gov/okefenokee/okefenokee_amphib_fish_mam_rep98.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A 20-to-30-year cycle of drought and fire has allowed the Okefenokee to exist as the unique wetland it is.&lt;ref name="AFM.pdf"/&gt; These periods cause changes in the abundance of certain plants (more grasses growing in exposed areas) the nesting success of certain wading birds (failure in extreme drought), and the location of some species of wildlife (fish migrate into deeper lakes and channels and are followed by predators).&lt;ref name="AFM.pdf"/&gt;

==Wildlife and protected species==
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
[[Image:OkefenokeeNWR3.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge]]
With its varied habitats, the Okefenokee has become an area known for its abundance of plants and animals. There are 621 species of plants growing in the swamp.&lt;ref name="AFM.pdf"/&gt; Animals include 39 fish, 37 amphibian, 64 reptile, 234 bird, and 50 mammal species.&lt;ref name="AFM.pdf"/&gt; The Okefenokee Swamp is world renowned for its amphibian populations that are bio-indicators of global health.&lt;ref name="fedreg"/&gt;

Wildlife species include [[raccoon]]s, [[wading bird]]s, [[duck]]s, [[American alligator|alligator]]s and other [[reptile]]s, a variety of [[amphibian]]s, [[North American river otter|river otter]]s, [[bobcat]]s, [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s, [[red fox]]es, [[wild boar|boar]]s, [[American mink|mink]]s, [[white-tailed deer]], [[gray fox]]es, [[striped skunk]]s, [[Florida black bear|black bear]]s, and [[songbird]]s.&lt;ref name="NWRprofile"/&gt;

The swamp habitat also provides for [[Threatened species|threatened]] and [[endangered species]], such as [[red-cockaded woodpecker]]s, [[wood stork]]s, [[Drymarchon|indigo snakes]], [[Gopherus polyphemus|gopher tortoise]]s and a wide variety of other wildlife species.&lt;ref name="fedreg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NWRprofile"/&gt;

==Facilities==
[[Image:OkefenokeeNWR2.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Canoeing in the Okefenokee NWR]]
There are opportunities for hiking, hunting, fishing, canoeing, boating, photography and wildlife observation.

===Visitor center===
The Richard S. Bolt Visitor Center at Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) was built in 1967, with an auditorium addition in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt; The {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building is cedar-sided with open, vaulted ceilings and flagstone floors.&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt; It houses exhibits, Okefenokee Wildlife League bookstore sales area, office space for staff and volunteers, storage, and a 100-seat surround-sound auditorium.&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt;

===Chesser Island===
In the late 19th century, W.T. Chesser and his family settled a small island on the eastern edge of the Okefenokee Swamp. He settled on a 592&amp;#8209;acre (2.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) island, now known as [[Chesser Island]].&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt; The Chesser homestead still stands on the island. The last of the Chessers left the island in 1958, but many members of the Chesser family remain in the local area.&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt;

===Fishing===
Lakes and slow-flowing water trails, called "runs,"cover much of the Okefenokee. More than 60 lakes dot the refuge, with depths ranging from a few feet to {{convert|15|ft|m}}. The largest, Billy's Lake, is 3¬Ω miles long and 100 to {{convert|250|yd}} wide. Fishing is permitted year round in accordance with Georgia State fishing laws. Using live bait fish or trot lines is prohibited.&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt;

===Canoeing and boating===
There are {{convert|121|mi|km}} of trails in the swamp, of which 70 are open to day-use motorboat {{convert|10|hp}} and under. Seven overnight shelters are available in the swamp's interior.
The refuge has six different boating trails (Red, Green, Blue, Purple, Orange, and Brown) giving users a choice of twelve different overnight canoe trips.

==Research and Development==

Onyx Solar has been involved with several solar energy research projects across the world. These projects include HERB, the retrofitting of residential buildings, in cooperation with the [[University of Nottingham]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.euroretrofit.com/partners/
 | title=Euro Retrofit, Partners
 | publisher=euroretrofit.com
 | accessdate=2016-09-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PVSITES, a project aimed to reduce market barriers for the large scale implementation of BIPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title=PV Sites Project Consortium Partners
 | publisher=pvsites.eu
 | accessdate=2016-09-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This company has also been involved with several solar energy research projects, any several of these projects have been in partnership with the European Commission. One example of an ongoing project with the European Commission is the ArtESun project, which seeks to bring new OPV (organic photovoltaic technologies) technologies to the thin-film PV market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Projects==

In March 2016, Onyx Solar signaled its completion of the installation of photovolatic glass at the entrance of the [[American Airlines Arena]] by announcing that its project had received the LEED Gold certification, which is the highest certificate for building sustainability. This project utilized around 300 crystalline silicon PV glass units, which were deployed in 14 circular skylights. This implementation allows American Airlines Arena to produce 34,500 kWh of solar power per year for on-site consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] announced that it will be fitting its retail stores in [[San Francisco]] with walkable solar glass floors for the purpose of generating electricity. The integration of solar power directly into its retail stores has been used as an example of Apple's focus on renewable technology. These walkways will be constructed with [[‚Äúa-Si Thin Film‚Äù|Thin-film solar cell]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]'': Organizaci√≥n de Solidaridad con los Pueblos de Asia, √Åfrica y Am√©rica Latina)'', abbreviated as '''OSPAAAL''', is a [[Cuba]]n political movement with the stated purpose of fighting [[globalisation]], [[imperialism]], [[neoliberalism]] and defending [[human rights]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} It publishes the [[magazine]] ''[[Tricontinental]]''. The OSPAAAL was founded in [[Havana]] in January 1966, after the Tricontinental Conference, a meeting of [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] delegates from [[Guinea]], [[Republic of Congo|the Congo]], [[South Africa]], [[Angola]], [[Vietnam]], [[Syria]], [[North Korea]], the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], Cuba, [[Puerto Rico]], [[Chile]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. [[Mehdi Ben Barka]], the Moroccan leader of the Tricontinental Conference, disappeared the year before.

One of the main purposes of the organisation is to promote the causes of [[socialism]] and [[communism]] in the [[Third World]]; for example, OSPAAAL strongly supported [[Hugo Ch√°vez]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} [[Social development]], which the organization says is a human right, is a recurring theme in OSPAAAL publications.

==History and context==
{{rquote|right|We are following the heroic example of Comandante [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]].| Venezuelan delegate at the first Tricontinental Conference in 1966 &lt;ref name="Kellner90"&gt;''Ernesto "Che" Guevara  (World Leaders Past &amp; Present)'', by Douglas Kellner, 1989, Chelsea House Publishers, {{ISBN|1-55546-835-7}}, pg 90&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The OSPAAAL was born out of the Tricontinental Conference in Havana, which [[Mehdi Ben Barka]] was preparing before his October 1965 assassination. The OSPAA (Organization for Solidarity for the People of Africa and Asia) had gathered itself for the first time in [[Cairo]], Egypt in 1957. 500 delegates from 35 countries represented their [[national liberation movements]] and parties rather than states. It was led by [[Isma√´l Tour√©]], the brother of [[Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©]], president of [[Guinea]]. [[Isma√´l Tour√©]] presided the board responsible of the solidarity funds, assisted by two vice-chairmen: Mehdi Ben Barka of Morocco and Chu Tzu-chi of the People's Republic of China. At that time, AAPSO (Africa Asian People's Solidarity Organization) was debating the inclusion of Cuba and the rest of the Caribbean and Latin America to the group, a question posed again in Cairo in June 1961 by the new commission, the Commission on Neocolonialism, which was presided by Ben Barka.

While the [[Casablanca Group]], founded in 1961, gathered "progressive states" (Egypt, Ghana, Guinea, [[Mali]], [[Libya]], and [[Morocco]]), the OSPAAL was an organization of movements, which aimed at creating national [[economic development]] plans for the newly independent states and break national isolation through [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]. In exile, Ben Barka resided there six months in 1964. [[Am√≠lcar Cabral]], [[Malcolm X]], and [[Che Guevara]] lived in the city around that time. [[Henri Curiel]] was there organizing "solidarity networks," which trained [[African National Congress]] activists. (The ANC had been prohibited in 1960, and Curiel would be murdered in 1978). Ben Barka was going to create an anti-colonialist magazine titled ''The African Review'', but he decided to enlarge the union to Latin America.

After the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in 1961, [[Fidel Castro]] moved even closer to the Soviet Union. In February 1962, Cuba was expelled from the [[Organization of American States]] (OEA). On October 3, 1965, Ben Barka declared in a press conference prior to the Havana conference that the "two currents of the [[world revolution]] would be represented there: the current born with the [[October Revolution]] and the national liberation revolutions' currents."

The fourth congress of the OSPAA, in Accra from May 6 to May 9, 1965, finally agreed on including Latin America and to take in account the founding January 1966 conference in Havana. In July, Medhi Ben Barka, who was presiding the preparatory council, assured the support of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and defined the objectives of the new organization, summed up as "total liberation:" aid to national liberation movements (in particular to the [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian movement]]), intensification of [[armed struggle|violent]] and peaceful struggles on all three continents, support to the [[Cuban Revolution]], suppression of foreign military bases, support of the [[nuclear disarmament]] option, and opposition to [[apartheid]] and [[racial segregation]]. In September, Ben Barka went to Havana to prepare the opening up of the conference on January 3, 1966. However, on October 29, 1965, he was disappeared in [[Paris]], allegedly abducted by Moroccan secret agents. The Havana Conference thus took place without him, and the OSPAAAL was officially founded.

==Posters==
From its foundation until the mid-1980s, OSPAAAL produced brightly coloured [[propaganda]] posters promoting their cause, however, financial difficulty and [[ink]] shortages forced the organization to stop producing these posters. However, in 2000, these posters began to be printed again.

These posters, as they intended to be [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]], usually had their message written in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. As opposed to being put up on walls around Cuba, these posters were instead folded up and stapled into copies of ''Tricontinental'', so that they could be distributed internationally. This allowed OSPAAAL to send its message to its  [[Subscription business model|subscribers]] around the world.

All OSPAAAL-Posters from the beginning until 2003 are documented and indexed in the book ''The Tricontinental Solidarity Poster''.&lt;ref name="Frick"&gt;Frick, Richard. ''The Tricontinental Solidarity Poster'' comedia-Verlag: 2003. {{ISBN|3-7212-0145-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One American, [[Jane Norling]], is among the artists who designed posters for OSPAAAL, and is one of eight women who contributed designs for 22 of the approximately 326 OSPAAAL posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/606934896|title=Revoluci√≥n! : Cuban poster art|last=1953-|first=Cushing, Lincoln,|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=9780811835824|oclc=606934896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Przewalski's Horse (02710137).jpg|thumb|A Przewalski's horse in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]]

'''Przewalski's horse''' ({{IPAc-en|(|p|)| É|…ô|Àà|v|…ëÀê|l|s|k|i}} {{respell|(p)sh…ô|VAHL|skee}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/przewalski-s-horse|title=the definition of przewalski's horse|website=www.dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-pl|p Ç…õÀàvalsk ≤i|lang}}; [[Khalkha Mongolian|Khalkha]] {{Lang-mn|—Ç–∞—Ö—å}}, ''takhi''; [[Habahe|Ak Kaba]] [[Tuvan language|Tuvan]]: [{{IPA|da…£…ô//da…¢…ô}}] ''dagy''; ''Equus przewalskii'' or ''Equus ferus przewalskii''),&lt;ref name=STWH/&gt; also called the '''Mongolian wild horse''' or '''Dzungarian horse''', is a rare and endangered horse native to the [[steppe]]s of central Asia.&lt;ref name=MSW3/&gt; At one time [[extinct in the wild]] (in Mongolia, the last wild Przewalski's horses had been seen in 1966), it has been [[Reintroduction|reintroduced]] to its native habitat in Mongolia at the [[Khustain Nuruu National Park]], Takhin Tal Nature Reserve, and Khomiin Tal.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] position is still debated, with some taxonomists treating Przewalski's horse as a [[species]], ''E. przewalskii'', others as a [[subspecies]] of [[wild horse]] (''E. ferus przewalskii'') or a feral variety of the domesticated horse (''E. f. caballus'').

[[Common name]]s for this [[equine]] include ''takhi'',&lt;ref name="ITG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takhi.org/en/|title=Takhi: Holy Animal of Mongolia|publisher=International Takhi Group|author=International Takhi Group|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asian wild horse, and Mongolian wild horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/7961/0|title=Equus ferus ssp. przewalskii |website=International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Redlist|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The horse is named after the Russian geographer and explorer [[Nikolay Przhevalsky|Niko≈Çaj Przewalski]].

Most "wild" horses today, such as the American [[Mustang (horse)|mustang]] or the Australian [[brumby]], are actually [[feral horse]]s descended from [[domesticated]] animals that escaped and adapted to life in the wild. Przewalski's horse may never have been domesticated and has long been considered the only true wild horse extant in the world today. However, a 2018 DNA study suggested that modern Przewalski's horses may descend from the domesticated horses of the [[Botai culture|Botai]].&lt;ref name="sciencemag.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pennisi, Elizabeth|title= Ancient DNA upends the horse family tree|publisher=sciencemag.org|date=22 February 2018|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/ancient-dna-upends-horse-family-tree}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Przewalski's horse was described in 1881 by L.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Poliakov, although the taxonomic position of Przewalski's horse remains controversial and no consensus exists whether it is a full species (''Equus przewalskii''), a subspecies of the [[wild horse]] (''Equus ferus przewalskii'', along with the other subspecies, [[Horse|domesticated horse]] ''E. f. caballus'', and the extinct [[tarpan]] ''E. f. ferus'')), or even a subpopulation of the domestic horse.&lt;ref name="lau 2009 199‚Äì208"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kavar08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChinaancientDNA/&gt;

==Lineage==
Early sequencing studies of [[DNA]] revealed several genetic characteristic of Przewalski's horse that differ from what is seen in modern domestic horses, indicating neither is ancestor of the other, and supporting the status of Przewalski horses as a remnant wild population not derived from domestic horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Massively Parallel Sequencing Approach Uncovers Ancient Origins and High Genetic Variability of Endangered Przewalski's Horses|url = http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/1096|journal = Genome Biology and Evolution|date = January 1, 2011|issn = 1759-6653|pmc = 3194890|pmid = 21803766|pages = 1096‚Äì1106|volume = 3|doi = 10.1093/gbe/evr067|language = en|first = Hiroki|last = Goto|first2 = Oliver A.|last2 = Ryder|first3 = Allison R.|last3 = Fisher|first4 = Bryant|last4 = Schultz|first5 = Sergei L.

Several subsequent DNA studies produced partially contradictory results.  A 2009 molecular analysis using [[ancient DNA]] recovered from archaeological sites placed Przewalski's horse in the middle of the domesticated horses,&lt;ref name=ChinaancientDNA/&gt; but a 2011 [[mitochondrial DNA]] analysis suggested that Przewalski's and modern domestic horses diverged some 160,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=GBE2011/&gt; An analysis based on whole genome sequencing and calibration with DNA from old horse bones gave a divergence date of 38‚Äì72 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Orlando | first1 = L. | last2 = Ginolhac | first2 = A.

A new analysis in 2018 involved genomic sequencing of ancient DNA from mid-fourth-millennium B.C. Botai domestic horses, as well as domestic horses from more recent archaeological sites, and comparison of these genomes with those of modern domestic and Przewalski's horses.  The study revealed that Przewalski's horses not only belong to the same genetic lineage as those from the Botai culture, but were the [[Feral animal|feral]] descendants of these ancient domestic animals, rather than representing a surviving population of never-domesticated horses.&lt;ref name="sciencemag.org"/&gt;  The Botai horses were found to have made only negligible genetic contribution to any of the other ancient or modern domestic horses studied, which must then have arisen from an independent domestication involving a different wild horse population.&lt;ref name="sciencemag.org"/&gt;

The [[karyotype]] of Przewalski‚Äôs horse differs from that of the domestic horse by an extra chromosome pair because of the [[Fission (biology)|fission]] of domestic horse chromosome&amp;nbsp;5 to produce the Przewalski‚Äôs horse chromosomes 23 and 24.  In comparison, the chromosomal differences between domestic horses and [[zebra]]s include numerous [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]], fusions, [[Chromosomal inversion|inversions]] and [[centromere]] repositioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Piras | first1=F.M. |last2=Nergadze |first2=S.G. |last3=Poletto |first3=V. |last4=Cerutti |first4=F. |last5=Ryder |first5=O.A. |last6=Leeb |first6=T. |last7=Raimondi |first7=E. |last8=Giulotto |first8=E. |title=Phylogeny of Horse Chromosome 5q in the Genus Equus and Centromere Repositioning | journal=Cytogenetic and Genome Research |year=2009 |volume=126 |pages=165‚Äì172 |doi=10.1159/000245916}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This gives Przewalski‚Äôs horse the highest [[diploid]] chromosome number among all equine species. They can interbreed with the domestic horse and produce fertile offspring (65 chromosomes).&lt;ref name="lau 2009 199‚Äì208"/&gt;

==Population==
Every Przewalski's horse presently living is descended from 9 of the 13 horses captured in 1945.&lt;ref name=boyd94/&gt; Two of these were hybrids, one sired from a wild horse stallion and domestic mare and the other from a wild stallion and a tarpan mare. These 13 horses were descended, in turn, from about 15 captured around 1900. A cooperative venture between the [[Zoological Society of London]] and Mongolian scientists has resulted in successful [[reintroduction]] of these horses from [[zoo]]s into their natural habitat in Mongolia; and {{As of|2011|lc=y}}, an estimated free-ranging population over 300 existed in the wild.&lt;ref name=IUCN2011/&gt; From a population of 13 horses held in captivity in 1945, the total number by the early 1990s was over 1,500.&lt;ref name=ZSL051219/&gt;

A population introduced in 1998 exists in the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] protected from interference by humans, and is thought to be increasing in size.&lt;ref name="ngWJ"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wendle|first1=John|title=Animals Rule Chernobyl 30 Years After Nuclear Disaster|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/060418-chernobyl-wildlife-thirty-year-anniversary-science/|website=National Geographic|accessdate=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
Przewalski's females are able to give birth at the age of three and have a gestation period around 11 to 12 months. Their reproduction process is seasonal, and in Mongolia, the season is towards the end of May, June, or July. Mating stallions do not start looking for mating partners until the age of five. Instinctively, the stallion looks to create his own group of mares or else wanders until he finds a group with its own leader. If the stallion finds a group of mares with its own leader, the stallion  usually fights the other leader stallion of the group. The mares adjust and follow the victor. Unlike most predators which are altricial (born helpless), most herbivores such as horses are precocial, meaning they come into the world relatively mature and mobile. They can typically keep up with the rest of the herd only a few hours after birth. The foals drink milk from the mares.

==Characteristics==
Przewalski's horse is stockily built in comparison to domesticated horses, with shorter legs. Typical height is about {{hands|12|-|14}}, length is about {{convert|2.1|m|abbr=on}}. They weigh around {{convert|300|kg|lb}}. The coat is generally [[Dun gene|dun]] in color with ''[[pangar√©]]'' features, varying from dark brown around the mane (which stands erect) to pale brown on the flanks and yellowish-white on the belly and around the muzzle. The legs of Przewalski's horse are often faintly striped, also typical of [[primitive markings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/AsiaTrail/fact-phorse.cfm|title=National Zoo information on Przewalski's horse|website=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tail is about {{convert|90|cm|2|abbr=on}} long, with a longer [[rump (animal)|dock]] and shorter hair than seen in domesticated horses.

The hooves of Przewalski's horse are longer in the back and have significantly thicker sole horns than feral horses. This is beneficial, as it improves the performance of the hooves.

The Przewalski's horse has 66 chromosomes, compared to 64 in all other horse species.&lt;ref name=Gaddy6/&gt;

===Behavior===
[[File:Equus przewalskii Le Villaret 02 2006-07-20.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Przewalski's horses]]
{{main|Horse behavior}}
In the wild, Przewalski's horses live in small, permanent family groups consisting of one adult stallion, one to three mares, and their common offspring. Offspring stay in the family group until they are no longer dependent, usually at two or three years old. Bachelor stallions, and sometimes old stallions, join bachelor groups. Family groups can join together to form a herd that moves together.

The patterns of their daily lives exhibit [[horse behavior]] similar to that of [[feral horse]] herds. Stallions herd, drive, and defend all members of their family, while the mares often display leadership in the family. Stallions and mares stay with their preferred partners for years. While behavioral synchronization is high among mares, stallions other than the main harem stallion are generally less stable in this respect.

Horses maintain visual contact with their family and herd at all times, and have a host of ways to communicate with one another, including vocalizations, [[scent marking]], and a wide range of visual and tactile signals. Each kick, groom, tilt of the ear, or other contact with another horse is a means of communicating. This constant communication leads to complex social behaviors among Przewalski's horses.&lt;ref&gt;Feh, C., 2005. Relationships and communication in socially natural horse herds. In: The Domestic Horse: the Evolution, Development and Management of its Behaviour. Ed. by Daniel Mills &amp; Sue McDonnell, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet===
Przewalski horse's diet consists mostly of vegetation. Many plant species are in a typical Przewalski's horse environment, including: ''[[Elymus repens]]'', ''[[Carex]] ''spp., [[Fabaceae]], and [[Asteraceae]].&lt;ref name="pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl"&gt;[http://www.pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl/article/ar59_4_19.pdf Diet of the Przewalski's horse Equus przewalskii in the Chernobyl exclusion zone] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185432/http://www.pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl/article/ar59_4_19.pdf |date=October 29, 2013 }} Kateryna Slivinska and Grzegorz Kopij, pages 841-847, July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; While the horses eat a variety of different plant species, they tend to favor one species during a specific time of the year. In other words, Przewalski's horses have seasonal food preferences. In the springtime, they favor ''Elymus repens'', ''[[Corynephorus canescens]]'', ''[[Festuca valesiaca]],'' and ''[[Chenopodium album]]''. In early summer, they favor ''[[Dactylis glomerata]]'' and ''[[Trifolium]]'', and in late summer, they gravitate towards ''E. repens'' and ''[[Vicia cracca]]''.&lt;ref name="pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl"/&gt; In winter, for example, the horses eat ''[[Salix]] ''spp., ''[[Pyrus communis]]'', ''[[Malus]] sylvatica'', ''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'', ''[[Rose|Rosa]]'' spp., and ''[[Alnus]]'' spp. Additionally, Przewalski's horses may dig for ''[[Festuca]]'' spp., ''[[Bromus inermis]]'', and ''E. repens'' that grow beneath the ice and snow. Their winter diet is very similar to the diet of domestic horses.&lt;ref name="pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl"/&gt; In the wintertime, Przewalski's horses experience hypodermis, a condition in which one‚Äôs metabolic rate slows down. They eat their food more slowly than they do during other times of the year. Looking at the species diet overall, however, Przewalski's horses most often eat ''E. repens'', ''[[Trifolium pratense]]'', ''Vicia cracca'', ''[[Poa trivialis]]'', ''Dactylis glomerata'', and ''Bromus inermis''.&lt;ref name="pol.j.ecol.cbe-pan.pl"/&gt;

Water, along with grassy vegetation, is another major component of Przewalski's horse's diet. The water consumption of 12 female Przewalski's horses that were living in a semireserve over a course of 17 months show that, on average, a Przewalski's horse drinks between 2.4 and 8.3 l of water a day, which is less than the amount of water a domestic horse drinks daily. In fact, the Przewalski's horse that consumed the most water in the study drank on average 8.6 l of water a day. This almost equals the lowest amount of water consumption for a domestic horse, which is 8.4 liters a day.

== History ==
In the 15th century, [[Johann Schiltberger]] recorded one of the first European sightings of the horses in the journal of his trip to Mongolia as a prisoner of the [[Mongol]] [[Khan (title)|Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/przewalski/index.htm Breeds of Livestock - Przewalski Horse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017090523/http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/przewalski/index.htm |date=October 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The horse is named after a Russian colonel of Polish descent, [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]] (1839‚Äì1888) (Niko≈Çaj Przewalski in Polish). He was the explorer and naturalist who first described the horse in 1881, after having gone on an expedition to find it, based on rumors of its existence. Many of these horses were captured around 1900 by [[Carl Hagenbeck]] and placed in zoos. As noted above, about 12-15 reproduced and formed today's population.
[[File:Portrait of Przewalski's Horse.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Head shot, showing convex profile]]
The native population declined in the 20th century due to a combination of factors, with the wild population in Mongolia dying out in the 1960s. The last herd was sighted in 1967, and the last individual horse in 1969. Expeditions after this failed to locate any horses, and the species had been designated "extinct in the wild" for over 30&amp;nbsp;years.

After 1945, only two captive populations in zoos remained, in [[Tierpark Hellabrunn|Munich]] and in [[Prague Zoo|Prague]]. The most valuable group, in [[Askania Nova]], [[Ukraine]], was shot by German soldiers during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] occupation, and the group in the United States had died out.  Competition with livestock, hunting, capture of foals for zoological collections, military activities, and harsh winters recorded in 1945, 1948, and 1956 are considered to be the main causes of the decline in Przewalski's horse population. By the end of the 1950s, only 12&amp;nbsp;individual horses were left in the world.&lt;ref name=Ryder1&gt;O. A. Ryder et al, ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Przewalski 26-9-2004-3.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Przewalski's horses.]]
In 1977, the Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski Horse was founded in [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands, by Jan and Inge Bouman. The foundation started a program of exchange between captive populations in zoos throughout the world to reduce [[inbreeding]], and later began a breeding program of its own. As a result of such efforts, the extant herd has retained a far greater genetic diversity than its [[Population bottleneck|genetic bottleneck]] made likely.&lt;ref name=Ryder1/&gt;

Since 1986, Chinese researchers have bred Prezewalski's horses in captivity, with the program seeing over 20 years of success.

In 1992, 16 horses were released into the wild in Mongolia, followed by additional animals later on. One of the areas to which they were reintroduced became [[Khustain Nuruu National Park]] in 1998. Another reintroduction site is [[Great Gobi&amp;nbsp;B Strictly Protected Area]], located at the fringes of the [[Gobi desert]]. Lastly, in 2004 and 2005, 22&amp;nbsp;horses were released by the Association Takh to a third reintroduction site in the buffer zone of the [[Khar Us Nuur National Park]], in the northern edge of the Gobi ecoregion. In the winter of 2009-2010, one of the worst ''[[dzud]]'' or snowy winter conditions ever hit Mongolia. The population of  Prezewalski's horse in the Great Gobi B SPA was drastically affected, providing clear evidence of the risks associated with reintroducing small and sequestered species in unpredictable and unfamiliar environments.

Since 2011, [[Prague Zoo]] has transported 35 horses to Mongolia in eight rounds, in cooperation with partners (Czech Air Force, European Breeding Programme for Przewalski's Horses, Association pour de cheval du Przewalski : Takh, Czech Development Agency, Czech Embassy in Mongolia and others) and it plans to continue to return horses to the wild in the future. In the framework of the project Return of the Wild Horses, it sustains its activities by supporting local inhabitants. The zoo has the longest uninterrupted history of breeding Przewalski's horses in the world and keeps the studbook of this species.

The reintroduced horses successfully reproduced, and the status of the animal was changed from "extinct in the wild" to "endangered" in 2005.&lt;ref name=ZSL051219/&gt; On the [[IUCN Red List]], they were reclassified from "extinct in the wild" to "critically endangered" after a reassessment in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/41763/summ|title=Equus ferus (Asian Wild Horse, Mongolian Wild Horse, Przewalski's Horse)|website=oldredlist.iucnredlist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from "critically endangered" to "endangered" after a 2011 reassessment.&lt;ref name=IUCN2011/&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
[[File:Wintercoat.jpg|thumb|Winter coat]]
While dozens of zoos worldwide have Przewalski's horses in small numbers,  specialized reserves are also dedicated primarily to the species. The world's largest captive-breeding program for Przewalski's horses is at the [[Askania Nova]] preserve in Ukraine. Several dozen horses were also released in the area evacuated after the [[Chernobyl accident]], which now serves as a deserted ''[[de facto]]'' nature reserve.&lt;ref name=bbc060420/&gt; In Chernobyl, the population reproduced at a high rate, reaching up to 200 individuals until poachers decreased their number to just 60 in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011}},  only an estimated 30‚Äì40 individuals remained.  An intensely researched population of free-ranging animals was also introduced to the [[Hortob√°gy National Park]]'' [[puszta]]'' in Hungary; data on social structure, behavior, and diseases gathered from these animals are used to improve the Mongolian conservation effort.

Several American zoos also collaborated in breeding ''E. f. przewalskii'' from 1979 to 1982.&lt;ref name=BC8204/&gt; Recent advances in equine reproductive science in the United States also have potential to further preserve and expand the gene pool. In October 2007, scientists at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]] successfully reversed a [[vasectomy]] on a Przewalski's horse ‚Äî the first operation of its kind on this species and possibly the first ever on any endangered species. While normally a vasectomy may be performed on an endangered animal under limited circumstances, particularly if an individual has already produced many offspring and its genes are overrepresented in the population, scientists realized the animal in question was one of the most genetically valuable Przewalski's horses in the North American breeding program.&lt;ref name=AP080617/&gt; The first birth by [[artificial insemination]] occurred on July 27, 2013, at the [[Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute]].&lt;ref name=PHAI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = First Przewalski's Horse Born Via Artificial Insemination|date = August 5, 2013|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130805-przewalski-horse-born-artificial-insemination-animal-science/|publisher = National Geographic|accessdate = August 14, 2013|last = Shenk|first = Emily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Villaret, located in the Cevennes National Park in southern France and run by the Association Takh, is a breeding site for Przewalski's horses that was created to allow the free expression of natural Przewalski's horse behaviors. Eleven zoo-born horses were brought to Le&amp;nbsp;Villaret in 1993. Horses born there are adapted to life in the wild; they are free to choose their own mates and must forage on their own. Such a unique breeding site was necessary to produce the individuals that were reintroduced to Mongolia in 2004 and 2005. In 2012, 39&amp;nbsp;individuals were at Le Villaret.&lt;ref name=takhleaflet/&gt;

The Przewalski's Horse Reintroduction Project of China was initiated in 1985 when 11&amp;nbsp;wild horses were imported from overseas. After more than two decades of effort, the [[Xinjiang]] Wild Horse Breeding Centre has bred a large number of the horses,  55 of which were released into the [[Kalamely Mountain]] area. The animals quickly adapted to their new environment. In 1988, six foals were born and survived, and by 2001, over 100&amp;nbsp;horses were at the centre.  {{As of|2013}}, the center hosted 127 horses divided into 13 breeding herds and three bachelor herds.

Reintroductions organized by Western European countries started in the 1990s. These were later stopped, mostly for financial reasons. Prague Zoo started a new cycle of transporting horses to the wild, which, with the support of public and many strategic partners, continues today.

The '''relativistic Doppler effect''' is the change in [[frequency]] (and [[wavelength]]) of [[light]], caused by the relative motion of the source and the observer (as in the classical [[Doppler effect]]), when taking into account effects described by the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]].

The relativistic Doppler effect is different from the non-relativistic [[Doppler effect]] as the equations include the [[time dilation]] effect of [[special relativity]] and do not involve the medium of propagation as a reference point. They describe the total difference in observed frequencies and possess the required [[Lorentz symmetry]].

Astronomers know of three sources of [[redshift]]/[[blueshift]]: Doppler shifts; [[gravitational redshift]]s (due to light exiting a gravitational field); and [[cosmological expansion]] (where space itself stretches). This article concerns itself only with Doppler shifts.

== Derivation ==
=== {{anchor|Motion along the line of sight}} Relativistic longitudinal Doppler effect===

Relativistic Doppler shift for the longitudinal case, with source and receiver moving directly towards or away from each other, is often derived as if it were the classical phenomenon, but modified by the addition of a [[time dilation]] term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sher |first1=D. |title=The Relativistic Doppler Effect |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |date=1968 |volume=62 |pages=105‚Äì111 |url=http://adsbit.harvard.edu//full/1968JRASC..62..105S/0000105.000.html |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gill |first1=T.

Following this approach towards deriving the relativistic longitudinal Doppler effect, assume the receiver and the source are moving ''away'' from each other with a relative speed &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; as measured by an observer on the receiver or the source (The sign convention adopted here is that &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is ''negative'' if the receiver and the source are moving ''towards'' each other).

Consider the problem in the [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] of the source.

Suppose one [[wavefront]] arrives at the receiver. The next wavefront is then at a distance &lt;math&gt;\lambda = c/f_s\,&lt;/math&gt; away from the receiver (where &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavelength]], &lt;math&gt;f_s\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[frequency]] of the waves that the source emits, and &lt;math&gt;c\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]]).

The wavefront moves with speed &lt;math&gt;c\,&lt;/math&gt;, but at the same time the receiver moves away with speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\lambda + vt = ct&lt;/math&gt;.

The period &lt;math&gt;t_{r,s}&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;f_{r,s}&lt;/math&gt; of light waves impinging on the receiver, ''as observed in the frame of the source,'' are
:&lt;math&gt;t_{r,s} = \frac{\lambda}{c - v} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \frac{c}{(c - v)f_s} = \frac{1}{(1 - \beta)f_s},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_{r,s} = 1/t_{r,s} =  (1 - \beta)f_s&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\beta = v / c\,&lt;/math&gt; is [[beta (velocity)|the speed of the receiver in terms of the speed of light]].

Thus far, the equations have been identical to those of the classical Doppler effect with a stationary source and a moving receiver.

However, due to relativistic effects, clocks on the receiver are [[time dilation|time dilated]] relative to clocks at the source. The receiver will measure the received frequency to be

:{{EquationRef|1|Eq. 1:}} &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;f_r = \gamma f_{r,s}  &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= \gamma(1 - \beta) f_s &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}\,f_s.&lt;/math&gt;
where

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Lorentz factor]].

The ratio
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f_s}{f_r} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}&lt;/math&gt;
is called the '''Doppler factor''' of the source relative to the receiver. (This terminology is particularly prevalent in the subject of [[astrophysics]]: see [[relativistic beaming]].)

The corresponding [[wavelength]]s are related by
:{{EquationRef|2|Eq. 2:}} &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda_r}{\lambda_s} = \frac{f_s}{f_r} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}},&lt;/math&gt;

Identical expressions for relativistic Doppler shift are obtained when performing the analysis in the reference frame of the ''receiver'' with a moving source. This matches up with the expectations of the [[principle of relativity]], which dictates that the result can not depend on which object is considered to be the one at rest. In contrast, the classic nonrelativistic Doppler effect ''is'' dependent on whether it is the source or the receiver that is stationary with respect to the medium.&lt;ref name=Feynman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morin/&gt;

===Transverse Doppler effect===
Suppose that a source and a receiver are both approaching each other in uniform inertial motion along paths that do not collide. The ''transverse Doppler effect'' (TDE) may refer to (a) the nominal [[blueshift]] predicted by [[special relativity]] that occurs when the emitter and receiver are at their points of closest approach; or (b) the nominal [[redshift]] predicted by special relativity when the receiver '''sees''' the emitter as being at its closest approach.&lt;ref name=Morin&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Classical Mechanics: With Problems and Solutions |chapter=Chapter 11: Relativity (Kinematics) |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~djmorin/chap11.pdf |first1=David |last1=Morin |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-139-46837-4 |pages=539‚Äì543 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404002006/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~djmorin/chap11.pdf |archivedate=4 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transverse Doppler effect is one of the main novel predictions of the special theory of relativity.

Whether a scientific report describes TDE as being a redshift or blueshift depends on the particulars of the experimental arrangement being related. For example, Einstein's original description of the TDE in 1907 described an experimenter looking at the center (nearest point) of a beam of "[[canal rays]]" (a beam of positive ions that is created by certain types of gas-discharge tubes). According to special relativity, the moving ions' emitted frequency would be reduced by the Lorentz factor, so that the received frequency would be reduced (redshifted) by the same factor.&lt;ref group=p name=Einstein1907&gt;{{cite journal |last=Einstein |first=Albert |year=1907 |title= On the Possibility of a New Test of the Relativity Principle (√úber die M√∂glichkeit einer neuen Pr√ºfung des Relativit√§tsprinzips) |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |volume=328 |issue=6 |pages=197‚Äì198 |bibcode=1907AnP...328..197E|doi=10.1002/andp.19073280613 |url=https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|In his seminal paper of 1905 introducing special relativity, Einstein had already published an expression for the Doppler shift perceived by an observer moving at an arbitrary angle with respect to an infinitely distant source of light. Einstein's 1907 derivation of the TDE represented a trivial consequence of his earlier published general expression.&lt;ref group=p name=Einstein1905&gt;{{cite journal |last=Einstein |first=Albert |authorlink= |year=1905 |title=Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K√∂rper  |language=de |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |volume=322 |issue=10 |pages=891‚Äì921 |doi=10.1002/andp.19053221004 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 1905AnP...322..891E }} [http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/ English translation: ‚ÄòOn the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies‚Äô]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, K√ºndig (1963) described an experiment where a [[M√∂ssbauer effect|M√∂ssbauer absorber]] was spun in a rapid circular path around a central M√∂ssbauer emitter.&lt;ref group=p name=Kundig&gt;{{cite journal|author=K√ºndig, Walter|date=1963|title=Measurement of the Transverse Doppler Effect in an Accelerated System|journal=Physical Review|volume=129|issue=6|pages=2371‚Äì2375|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.129.2371|bibcode = 1963PhRv..129.2371K }}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained below, this experimental arrangement resulted in K√ºndig's measurement of a blueshift.

==== Source and receiver are at their points of closest approach ====
[[File:Transverse Doppler effect scenarios 3.svg|thumb|300px|Figure 2. Source and receiver are at their points of closest approach. (a) Analysis in the frame of the receiver. (b) Analysis in the frame of the source.]]
In this scenario, the point of closest approach is frame-independent and represents the moment where there is no change in distance versus time. Figure&amp;nbsp;2 demonstrates that the ease of analyzing this scenario depends on the frame in which it is analyzed.&lt;ref name=Morin/&gt; 
* Fig.&amp;nbsp;2a. If we analyze the scenario in the frame of the receiver, we find that the analysis is more complicated than it should be. The apparent position of a celestial object is displaced from its true position (or geometric position) because of the object's motion during the time it takes its light to reach an observer. The source would be time-dilated relative to the receiver, but the redshift implied by this time dilation would be offset by a blueshift due to the longitudinal component of the relative motion between the receiver and the apparent position of the source.
* Fig.&amp;nbsp;2b. It is much easier if, instead, we analyze the scenario from the frame of the source. An observer situated at the source knows, from the problem statement, that the receiver is at its closest point to him. That means that the receiver has no longitudinal component of motion to complicate the analysis. (i.e. dr/dt = 0 where r is the distance between receiver and source) Since the receiver's clocks are time-dilated relative to the source, the light that the receiver receives is blue-shifted by a factor of gamma. In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;f_r = \gamma f_s&lt;/math&gt;

==== Receiver ''sees'' the source as being at its closest point ====
[[File:Transverse Doppler effect scenarios 4.svg|thumb|Figure 3. Transverse Doppler shift for the scenario where the receiver ''sees'' the source as being at its closest point.]]
This scenario is equivalent to the receiver looking at a direct right angle to the path of the source. The analysis of this scenario is best conducted from the frame of the receiver. Figure&amp;nbsp;3 shows the receiver being illuminated by light from when the source was closest to the receiver, even though the source has moved on.&lt;ref name=Morin/&gt; Because the source's clock is time dilated as measured in the frame of the receiver, and because there is no longitudinal component of its motion, the light from the source, emitted from this closest point, is redshifted with frequency

:&lt;math&gt;f_r = \frac{f_s}{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

In the literature, most reports of transverse Doppler shift analyze the effect in terms of the receiver pointed at direct right angles to the path of the source, thus ''seeing'' the source as being at its closest point and observing a redshift.

==== Point of null frequency shift ====
[[File:Transverse Doppler effect scenarios 6.svg|thumb|300px|Figure 4. Null frequency shift occurs for a pulse that travels the shortest distance from source to receiver.]]
Given that, in the case where the inertially moving source and receiver are geometrically at their nearest approach to each other, the receiver observes a blueshift, whereas in the case where the receiver ''sees'' the source as being at its closest point, the receiver observes a redshift, there obviously must exist a point where blueshift changes to a redshift. In Fig.&amp;nbsp;2, the signal travels perpendicularly to the receiver path and is blueshifted. In Fig.&amp;nbsp;3, the signal travels perpendicularly to the source path and is redshifted.

As seen in Fig.&amp;nbsp;4, null frequency shift occurs for a pulse that travels the shortest distance from source to receiver. When viewed in the frame where source and receiver have the same speed, this pulse is emitted perpendicularly to the source's path and is received perpendicularly to the receiver's path. The pulse is emitted slightly before the point of closest approach, and it is received slightly after.&lt;ref name="Brown_b"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Kevin S. |title=The Doppler Effect |url=https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath587/kmath587.htm |publisher=Mathpages |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== One object in circular motion around the other ====
[[File:Transverse Doppler effect scenarios 5.svg|thumb|300px|Figure 5. Transverse Doppler effect for two scenarios: (a) receiver moving in a circle around the source; (b) source moving in a circle around the receiver.]]

Fig.&amp;nbsp;5 illustrates two variants of this scenario. Both variants can be analyzed using simple time dilation arguments.&lt;ref name=Morin/&gt; Figure&amp;nbsp;5a is essentially equivalent to the scenario described in Figure&amp;nbsp;2b, and the receiver observes light from the source as being blueshifted by a factor of &lt;math&gt;\gamma.&lt;/math&gt;. Figure&amp;nbsp;5b is essentially equivalent to the scenario described in Figure&amp;nbsp;3, and the light is redshifted.

The only seeming complication is that the orbiting objects are in accelerated motion. An accelerated particle does not have an inertial frame in which it is always at rest. However, an inertial frame can always be found which is momentarily comoving with the particle. This frame, the [[Proper reference frame (flat spacetime)|''momentarily comoving reference frame'' (MCRF)]], enables application of special relativity to the analysis of accelerated particles. If an inertial observer looks at an accelerating clock, only the clock's instantaneous speed is important when computing time dilation.&lt;ref name=Misner&gt;{{Cite book|author=Misner, C. W., Thorne, K. S., and Wheeler, J. A,|title=Gravitation|year=1973|page=163|publisher=Freeman|isbn=0716703440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The converse, however, is not true. The analysis of scenarios where ''both'' objects are in accelerated motion requires a somewhat more sophisticated analysis. Not understanding this point has led to confusion and misunderstanding.

==== Source and receiver both in circular motion around a common center ====
[[File:Transverse Doppler effect scenarios 7.svg|thumb|Figure 6. Source and receiver are placed on opposite ends of a rotor, equidistant from the center.]]
Suppose source and receiver are located on opposite ends of a spinning rotor, as illustrated in Fig.&amp;nbsp;6. Kinematic arguments (special relativity) and arguments based on noting that there is no difference in potential between source and receiver in the pseudogravitational field of the rotor (general relativity) both lead to the conclusion that there should be no Doppler shift between source and receiver.

In 1961, Champeney and [[Philip Burton Moon | Moon]] conducted a [[M√∂ssbauer effect|M√∂ssbauer rotor experiment]]  testing exactly this scenario, and found that the M√∂ssbauer absorption process was unaffected by rotation.&lt;ref name="Champeney" group=p&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Champeney |first1=D. C. |last2=Moon |first2=P. B. |title=Absence of Doppler Shift for Gamma Ray Source and Detector on Same Circular Orbit |journal=Proc. Phys. Soc. (London) |date=1961 |volume=77 |pages=350‚Äì352}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that their findings supported special relativity.

This conclusion generated some controversy. A certain persistent critic of relativity maintained that, although the experiment was consistent with general relativity, it refuted special relativity, his point being that since the emitter and absorber were in uniform relative motion, special relativity demanded that a Doppler shift be observed. The fallacy with this critic's argument was, as demonstrated in section [[#Point of null frequency shift|Point of null frequency shift]], that it is simply not true that a Doppler shift must always be observed between two frames in uniform relative motion.&lt;ref name="Sama"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sama |first1=Nicholas |title=Some Comments on a Relativistic Frequency-Shift Experiment of Champeney and Moon |journal=American Journal of Physics |date=1969 |volume=37 |pages=832‚Äì833 |doi=10.1119/1.1975859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as demonstrated in section [[#Source and receiver are at their points of closest approach|Source and receiver are at their points of closest approach]], the difficulty of analyzing a relativistic scenario often depends on the choice of reference frame. Attempting to analyze the scenario in the frame of the receiver involves much tedious algebra. It is much easier, almost trivial, to establish the lack of Doppler shift between emitter and absorber in the laboratory frame.&lt;ref name="Sama"/&gt;

As a matter of fact, however, Champeney and Moon's experiment said nothing either pro or con about special relativity. Because of the symmetry of the setup, it turns out that virtually ''any'' conceivable theory of the Doppler shift between frames in uniform inertial motion must yield a null result in this experiment.&lt;ref name="Sama"/&gt;

Rather than being equidistant from the center, suppose the emitter and absorber were at differing distances from the rotor's center. For an emitter at radius &lt;math&gt;R'&lt;/math&gt; and the absorber at radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; ''anywhere'' on the rotor, the ratio of the emitter frequency, &lt;math&gt;\nu ' ,&lt;/math&gt; and the absorber frequency, &lt;math&gt;\nu ,&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:{{EquationRef|3|Eq. 3:}} &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \frac{\nu '}{\nu} = \left( \frac{1 - R^2 \omega ^2 }{ 1 - R' ^2 \omega ^2 } \right) ^{1/2} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular velocity of the rotor. The source and emitter do not have to be 180¬∞ apart, but can be at any angle with respect to the center.&lt;ref name="Synge" group=p&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Synge |first1=J.

===Motion in an arbitrary direction===
[[File:Doppler shift with source and receiver moving at arbitrary angles.svg|thumb|Figure 7. Doppler shift with source moving at an arbitrary angle with respect to the line between source and receiver.]]

The analysis used in section [[#Relativistic longitudinal Doppler effect|Relativistic longitudinal Doppler effect]] can be extended in a straightforward fashion to calculate the Doppler shift for the case where the inertial motions of the source and receiver are at any specified angle.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown_a&gt;

Fig.&amp;nbsp;7 presents the scenario from the frame of the receiver, with the source moving at speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; at an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_r&lt;/math&gt; measured in the frame of the receiver. The radial component of the source's motion along the line of sight is equal to &lt;math&gt;v \cos{\theta_r}.&lt;/math&gt;

The equation below can be interpreted as the classical Doppler shift for a stationary and moving source modified by the Lorentz factor &lt;math&gt;\gamma :&lt;/math&gt;

:{{EquationRef|4|Eq. 4:}} &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; f_r = \frac{f_s}{\gamma\left(1 + \beta \cos\theta_r\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case when &lt;math&gt;\theta_r = 90^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_r = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt; one obtains the [[#Transverse Doppler effect|transverse Doppler effect]]:
:&lt;math&gt;f_r = \frac {f_s}  {\gamma}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

In his 1905 paper on special relativity,&lt;ref group=p name=Einstein1905/&gt; Einstein obtained a somewhat different looking equation for the Doppler shift equation. After changing the variable names in Einstein's equation to be consistent with those used here, his equation reads
:{{EquationRef|5|Eq. 5:}} &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; f_r = \gamma \left(  1 - \beta \cos \theta_s \right)  f_s.&lt;/math&gt;

The differences stem from the fact that Einstein evaluated the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_s&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the source rest frame rather than the receiver rest frame. &lt;math&gt; \theta_s&lt;/math&gt; is not equal to &lt;math&gt; \theta_r &lt;/math&gt; because of the effect of [[relativistic aberration]]. The relativistic aberration equation is:

:{{EquationRef|6|Eq. 6:}} &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta_r=\frac{\cos \theta_s-\beta }{1-\beta \cos \theta_s} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the relativistic aberration equation {{EquationNote|6|Equation&amp;nbsp;6}} into  {{EquationNote|4|Equation&amp;nbsp;4}} yields  {{EquationNote|5|Equation&amp;nbsp;5}}, demonstrating the consistency of these alternate equations for the Doppler shift.&lt;ref name=Brown_a/&gt;

Setting &lt;math&gt;\theta_r = 0&lt;/math&gt; in {{EquationNote|4|Equation&amp;nbsp;4}} or &lt;math&gt;\theta_s = 0&lt;/math&gt; in {{EquationNote|5|Equation&amp;nbsp;5}} yields {{EquationNote|1|Equation&amp;nbsp;1}}, the expression for relativistic longitudinal Doppler shift.

A four-vector approach to deriving these results may be found in Landau and Lifshitz (2005).&lt;ref name=Landau&gt;{{cite book| title=The Classical Theory of Fields | series=Course of Theoretical Physics: Volume 2 | last1=Landau | first1=L.D. | authorlink1=Lev Landau | last2=Lifshitz | first2=E.M. | authorlink2=Evgeny Lifshitz | others=Trans.

[[File:Compare01.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 8. Comparison of the relativistic Doppler effect (top) with the non-relativistic effect (bottom).]]
Fig.&amp;nbsp;8 helps us understand, in a rough qualitative sense, how the relativistic Doppler effect and [[relativistic aberration]] differ from the non-relativistic [[Doppler effect]] and non-relativistic [[aberration of light]]. Assume that the observer is uniformly surrounded in all directions by yellow stars emitting monochromatic light of 570&amp;nbsp;nm. The arrows in each diagram represent the observer's velocity vector relative to its surroundings, with a magnitude of 0.89&amp;nbsp;''c''. 
* In the non-relativistic case, the light ahead of the observer is blueshifted to a wavelength of 300&amp;nbsp;nm in the medium ultraviolet, while light behind the observer is redshifted to 5200&amp;nbsp;nm in the intermediate infrared. Because of the aberration of light, objects formerly at right angles to the observer appear shifted forwards by 42¬∞. 
* In the relativistic case, the light ahead of the observer is blueshifted to a wavelength of 137&amp;nbsp;nm in the far ultraviolet, while light behind the observer is redshifted to 2400&amp;nbsp;nm in the short wavelength infrared. Because of the relativistic aberration of light, objects formerly at right angles to the observer appear shifted forwards by 63¬∞.
* In both cases, the monochromatic stars ahead of and behind the observer are Doppler-shifted towards invisible wavelengths. If, however, the observer had eyes that could see into the ultraviolet and infrared, he would see the stars ahead of him as brighter and more closely clustered together than the stars behind, but the stars would be far brighter and far more concentrated in the relativistic case.&lt;ref name="Savage1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Savage |first1=C.

Real stars are not monochromatic, but emit a range of wavelengths approximating a [[black body]] distribution. It is not necessarily true that stars ahead of the observer would show a bluer color. This is because the whole spectral energy distribution is shifted. At the same time that visible light is blueshifted into invisible ultraviolet wavelengths, infrared light is blueshifted into the visible range. Precisely what changes in the colors one sees depends on the physiology of the human eye and on the spectral characteristics of the light sources being observed.&lt;ref name="Brandeker"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brandeker |first1=Alexis |title=What would a relativistic interstellar traveller see? |url=http://www.math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/Spaceship/spaceship.html |website=Physics FAQ |publisher=Math Department, University of California, Riverside |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kraus2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kraus |first1=U. |title=Brightness and color of rapidly moving objects: The visual appearance of a large sphere revisited |journal=Am.

==Doppler effect on intensity==
The Doppler effect (with arbitrary direction) also modifies the perceived source intensity: this can be expressed concisely by the fact that source strength divided by the cube of the frequency is a Lorentz invariant&lt;ref group="p"&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 79| issue = 4| pages = 1340| last = Johnson| first = Montgomery H.| last2 = Teller| first2 = Edward| title = Intensity changes in the Doppler effect| journal = Proc.

USA | date = February 1982|doi=10.1073/pnas.79.4.1340 | pmid = 16593162| url = http://www.pnas.org/content/79/4/1340.abstract |bibcode = 1982PNAS...79.1340J | pmc=345964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Here, "source strength" refers to [[spectral intensity]] in ''frequency'', i.e., power per unit solid angle and per unit frequency, expressed in watts per steradian per hertz; for spectral intensity in ''wavelength'', the cube should be replaced by a fifth power.&lt;/ref&gt;  This implies that the total radiant intensity (summing over all frequencies) is multiplied by the fourth power of the Doppler factor for frequency.
&lt;!-- It would be nice if someone could expand on this, for example by providing a derivation from the Lorentz transformation laws on the electric and magnetic fields applied to a plane wave. --&gt;

As a consequence, since [[Planck's law]] describes the [[black body radiation]] as having a spectral intensity in frequency proportional to &lt;math&gt;\nu^3/\left(e^{h\nu/kT} - 1\right)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''T'' is the source temperature and ''ŒΩ'' the frequency), we can draw the conclusion that ''a black body spectrum seen through a Doppler shift (with arbitrary direction) is still a black body spectrum'' with a temperature multiplied by the same Doppler factor as frequency.

This result provides one of the pieces of evidence that serves to distinguish the [[Big Bang theory]] from alternative theories proposed to explain the [[cosmological redshift]].&lt;ref name="Wright_tired_light"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wright |first1=Edward L.

== Experimental verification ==
{{Main|Ives‚ÄìStilwell experiment|l1=Ives‚ÄìStilwell-, M√∂ssbauer rotor-, and Spectroscopy tests of time dilation}}

Since the transverse Doppler effect is one of the main novel predictions of the special theory of relativity, the detection and precise quantification of this effect has been an important goal of experiments attempting to validate special relativity.

=== Ives and Stilwell-type measurements ===
[[File:Ives-Stilwell rationale.svg|thumb|300px|Figure 9. Why it is difficult to measure the transverse Doppler effect accurately using a transverse beam.]]
Einstein (1907) had initially suggested that the TDE might be measured by observing a beam of "[[canal rays]]" at right angles to the beam.&lt;ref group=p name=Einstein1907/&gt; Attempts to measure TDE following this scheme proved it to be impractical, since the maximum speed of particle beam available at the time was only a few thousandths of the speed of light.

Fig.&amp;nbsp;9 shows the results of attempting to measure the 4861 Angstrom line emitted by a beam of canal rays (a mixture of H1+, H2+, and H3+ ions) as they recombine with electrons stripped from the dilute hydrogen gas used to fill the Canal ray tube. Here, the predicted result of the TDE is a 4861.06 Angstrom line. On the left, longitudinal Doppler shift results in broadening the emission line to such an extent that the TDE cannot be observed. The middle figures illustrate that even if one narrows one's view to the exact center of the beam, very small deviations of the beam from an exact right angle introduce shifts comparable to the predicted effect.

Rather than attempt direct measurement of the TDE, [[Ives‚ÄìStilwell experiment|Ives and Stilwell (1938)]] used a concave mirror that allowed them to simultaneously observe a nearly longitudinal direct beam (blue) and its reflected image (red). Spectroscopically, three lines would be observed: An undisplaced emission line, and blueshifted and redshifted lines. The average of the redshifted and blueshifted lines would be compared with the wavelength of the undisplaced emission line. The difference that Ives and Stilwell measured corresponded, within experimental limits, to the effect predicted by special relativity.&lt;ref group="p" name=Ives1938&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ives |first=H. E. |authorlink= |author2=Stilwell, G. R.  |year=1938 |title=An experimental study of the rate of a moving atomic clock |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=215 |bibcode=1938JOSA...28..215I |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.1364/JOSA.28.000215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various of the subsequent repetitions of the Ives and Stilwell experiment have adopted other strategies for measuring the mean of blueshifted and redshifted particle beam emissions. In some recent repetitions of the experiment, modern accelerator technology has been used to arrange for the observation of two counter-rotating particle beams. In other repetitions, the energies of gamma rays emitted by a rapidly moving particle beam have been measured at opposite angles relative to the direction of the particle beam. Since these experiments do not actually measure the wavelength of the particle beam at right angles to the beam, some authors have preferred to refer to the effect they are measuring as the "quadratic Doppler shift" rather than TDE.&lt;ref group=p&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olin |first1=A. |last2=Alexander |first2=T.

=== Direct measurement of transverse Doppler effect ===
The advent of [[particle accelerator]] technology has made possible the production of particle beams of considerably higher energy than was available to Ives and Stilwell. This has enabled the design of tests of the transverse Doppler effect directly along the lines of how Einstein originally envisioned them, i.e. by directly viewing a particle beam at a 90¬∞ angle. For example, Hasselkamp et al. (1979) observed the ''H''Œ± line emitted by hydrogen atoms moving at speeds ranging from 2.53√ó10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm/s to 9.28√ó10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm/s, finding the coefficient of the second order term in the relativistic approximation to be 0.52¬±0.03, in excellent agreement with the theoretical value of 1/2.&lt;ref group=p&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hasselkamp |first1=D. |last2=Mondry |first2=E. |last3=Sharmann |first3=A. |title=Direct observation of the transversal Doppler-shift |journal=Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik A |date=1979 |volume=289 |pages=151‚Äì155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other direct tests of the TDE on rotating platforms were made possible by the discovery of the [[M√∂ssbauer effect]], which enables the production of exceedingly narrow resonance lines for nuclear gamma ray emission and absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Saburo Nasu |editor1-last=Yoshida |editor1-first=Yutaka |editor2-last=Langouche |editor2-first=Guido |title=M√∂ssbauer Spectroscopy: Tutorial Book |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3642322198 |pages=1‚Äì22 |year=2013 |chapter=General Introduction to M√∂ssbauer Spectroscopy}}&lt;/ref&gt; M√∂ssbauer effect experiments have proven themselves easily capable of detecting TDE using emitter-absorber relative velocities on the order of 2√ó10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm/s.

=== Time dilation measurements ===
The transverse Doppler effect and the kinematic time dilation of special relativity are closely related. All validations of TDE represent validations of kinematic time dilation, and most validations of kinematic time dilation have also represented validations of TDE. An online resource, "What is the experimental basis of Special Relativity?" has documented, with brief commentary, many of the tests that, over the years, have been used to validate various aspects of special relativity.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Tom |last2=Schleif |first2=Siegmar |title=What is the experimental basis of Special Relativity? |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/experiments.html |website=The Original Usenet Physics FAQ |publisher=Department of Mathematics, University of California, Riverside |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaivola et al.

These experiments compared the frequency of two lasers, one locked to the frequency of a  neon atom transition in a fast beam, the other locked to the same transition in thermal neon.

== Relativistic Doppler effect for sound and light ==
[[File:Doppler spacetime diagram for sound.svg|thumb|Figure 10. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is applicable to both sound and light.]]
First-year physics textbooks almost invariably analyze Doppler shift for sound in terms of Newtonian kinematics, while analyzing Doppler shift for light and electromagnetic phenomena in terms of relativistic kinematics. This gives the false impression that acoustic phenomena requires a different analysis than light and radio waves.

The traditional analysis of the Doppler effect for sound represents a low speed approximation to the exact, relativistic analysis. The fully relativistic analysis for sound is, in fact, equally applicable to both sound and electromagnetic phenomena.

Consider the spacetime diagram in Fig.&amp;nbsp;10. Worldlines for a tuning fork (the source) and a receiver are both illustrated on this diagram. Events ''O'' and ''A'' represent two vibrations of the tuning fork. The period of the fork is the magnitude of ''OA'', and the inverse slope of ''AB'' represents the speed of signal propagation (i.e. the speed of sound) to event ''B''. We can therefore write:&lt;ref name=Brown_a/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;c_s = \frac{x_B - x_A}{t_B - t_A}&lt;/math&gt; (speed of sound)
: &lt;math&gt;v_s = -\frac{x_A}{t_A} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; v_r = \frac{x_B}{t_B} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (speeds of source and receiver)
: &lt;math&gt; |OA| = \sqrt{ t_A^2 - (x_A/c)^2 }&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; |OB| = \sqrt{ t_B^2 - (x_B/c)^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v_s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_r&lt;/math&gt; are assumed to be less than &lt;math&gt;c_s,&lt;/math&gt; since otherwise their passage through the medium will set up shock waves, invalidating the calculation. Some routine algebra gives the ratio of frequencies:

:{{EquationRef|7|Eq. 7:}} &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \frac{f_r}{f_s} = \frac{|OA|}{|OB|} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; = \frac{1 - v_r/c_s}{1+v_s/c_s} \sqrt{ \frac{1 - (v_s/c)^2 }{ 1-(v_r/c)^2 }} &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;v_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_s&lt;/math&gt; are small compared with &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, the above equation reduces to the classical Doppler formula for sound.

If the speed of signal propagation &lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, it can be shown that the absolute speeds &lt;math&gt;v_s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_r&lt;/math&gt; of the source and receiver merge into a single relative speed independent of any reference to a fixed medium. Indeed, we obtain {{EquationNote|1|Equation&amp;nbsp;1}}, the formula for relativistic longitudinal Doppler shift.&lt;ref name=Brown_a/&gt;

Analysis of the spacetime diagram in Fig.&amp;nbsp;10 gave a general formula for source and receiver moving directly along their line of sight, i.e. in collinear motion.

[[File:Doppler shift for sound with moving source and receiver.svg|thumb|Figure 11. A source and receiver are moving in different directions and speeds in a frame where the speed of sound is independent of direction.]]
Fig.&amp;nbsp;11 illustrates a scenario in two dimensions. The source moves with velocity &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v_{s}}&lt;/math&gt; (at the time of emission). It emits a signal which travels at velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; towards the receiver, which is traveling at velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_r}&lt;/math&gt; at the time of reception. The analysis is performed in a coordinate system in which the signal's speed &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{C}|&lt;/math&gt; is independent of direction.&lt;ref name=Brown_b/&gt;

The ratio between the proper frequencies for the source and receiver is

:{{EquationRef|8|Eq. 8:}} &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \frac{f_r}{f_s} 
= \frac{1 - \frac{|\mathbf{v_r}|}{\mathbf{|C|}} \cos ( \theta_\mathbf{C,v_r}) } 
       {1 - \frac{|\mathbf{v_s}|}{\mathbf{|C|}} \cos ( \theta_\mathbf{C,v_s})  
       }  \sqrt{ \frac{1-(v_s/c)^2}{ 1-(v_r/c)^2 } } &lt;/math&gt;

The leading ratio has the form of the classical Doppler effect, while the square root term represents the relativistic correction. If we consider the angles relative to the frame of the source, then &lt;math&gt;v_s = 0&lt;/math&gt; and the equation reduces to {{EquationNote|5|Equation&amp;nbsp;5}}, Einstein's 1905 formula for the Doppler effect. If we consider the angles relative to the frame of the receiver, then &lt;math&gt;v_r = 0&lt;/math&gt; and the equation reduces to {{EquationNote|4|Equation&amp;nbsp;4}}, the alternative form of the Doppler shift equation discussed previously.&lt;ref name=Brown_b/&gt;

'''Soil biodiversity''' refers to the relationship of [[soil]] to [[biodiversity]] and to aspects of the soil that can be managed in relation to biodiversity. Soil biodiversity relates to some [[Drainage basin|catchment]] management considerations.

==Biodiversity==
According to the Australian [[Department of the Environment and Water Resources]], biodiversity is "the variety of life: the different plants, animals and micro-organisms, their genes and the ecosystems of which they are a part."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/ Department of Environment and Water Resources, 2007, viewed June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Biodiversity and soil are strongly linked, because soil is the medium for a large variety of organisms, and interacts closely with the wider [[biosphere]]. Conversely, biological activity is a primary factor in the physical and chemical formation of soils.&lt;ref name=Bardgett2005&gt;Bardgett, RD 2005, The biology of soil: a community and ecosystem approach, Oxford University Press Inc, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil provides a vital [[habitat]], primarily for [[microbe]]s (including [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]]), but also for [[microfauna]] (such as [[protozoa]] and [[nematode]]s), [[Soil mesofauna|mesofauna]] (such as microarthropods and enchytraeids), and macrofauna (such as [[earthworm]]s, [[termite]]s, and [[millipede]]s).&lt;ref name=Bardgett2005/&gt; The primary role of soil biota is to recycle organic matter that is derived from the "above-ground plant-based food web".

Soil is in close cooperation with the wider biosphere. The maintenance of fertile soil is "one of the most vital [[ecological services]] the living world performs", and the "mineral and organic contents of soil must be replenished constantly as plants consume soil elements and pass them up the [[food chain]]".&lt;ref name=Baskin1997&gt;Baskin, Y 1997, The work of nature, The Scientific Community on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE), Island Press, Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[correlation]] of soil and biodiversity can be observed spatially. For example, both natural and [[Agriculture|agricultural]] vegetation boundaries correspond closely to soil boundaries, even at continental and global scales.&lt;ref name=YoungYoung2001&gt;Young, A &amp; Young R 2001, Soils in the Australian landscape, Oxford University Press, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;

A "subtle synchrony" is how Baskin (1997) describes the relationship that exists between the soil and the diversity of life, above and below the ground. It is not surprising that [[soil management]] has a direct effect on biodiversity. This includes practices that influence soil volume, structure, biological, and chemical characteristics, and whether soil exhibits adverse effects such as reduced [[fertility (soil)|fertility]], [[soil acidification]], or [[Soil salinity|salinisation]].&lt;ref name=Baskin1997/&gt;

==Process effects==

===Acidification===
[[File:World Soil pH.svg|thumb|343px|right|Global variation in [[Soil acidity]]: '''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt;''' = acidic soil. '''&lt;span style="color:yellow;"&gt;Yellow&lt;/span&gt;''' = neutral soil. '''&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt;''' = alkaline soil. '''Black''' = no data.]]

[[Soil acidity]] (or alkalinity) is the concentration of [[hydrogen ion]]s (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in the soil. Measured on the [[pH]] scale, soil acidity is an invisible condition that directly affects [[soil fertility]] and toxicity by determining which elements in the soil are available for absorption by plants. Increases in soil acidity are caused by removal of agricultural product from the paddock, leaching of [[nitrogen]] as [[nitrate]] below the root zone, inappropriate use of nitrogenous [[fertilizer]]s, and buildup of [[organic matter]].&lt;ref name=SlatteryHollier2002&gt;Slattery, B and Hollier, C (2002). Impacts of Acid Soils in Victoria, A report for Department of Natural Resources and Environment, Goulburn Broken Catchment Management Authority and North East Catchment Management Authority&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the soils in the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)#Agriculture|Victoria]] are naturally acidic; however, about 30,000 square kilometres or 23% of Victoria's agricultural soils suffer reduced productivity due to increased acidity.&lt;ref name=SlatteryHollier2002/&gt; Soil acidity has been seen to damage the roots of the plants.&lt;ref name=Haling2010&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Haling, R |author2=Simpson, R |author3=Culvenor, R |author4=Lambers, H |author5=Richardson, A | year=2010 | title= Effect of soil acidity, soil strength and macropores on root growth and morphology of perennial grass species differing in acid-soil resistance | journal= Plant, Cell &amp; Environment | volume= 34 | issue=3 |pages=444‚Äì456 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2010.02254.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants in higher acidity have smaller, less durable roots.&lt;ref name=Haling2010/&gt; Some evidence has shown that the acidity damages the tips of the roots restricting further growth.&lt;ref name=Haling2010/&gt; The height of the plants has also seen a marked restriction when grown in acidic soils, as seen in American and Russian [[wheat]] populations.&lt;ref name=Horne1995&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Horne, JE |author2=Kalevitch, AE |author3=Filimonova, MV | year= 1995 |title= Soil acidity on initial wheat growth and development | journal=Journal of Sustainable Agriculture | volume=7 | issue=2 | pages=5‚Äì13 | doi=10.1300/j064v07n02_03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of seeds that are even able to [[Germination|germinate]] in acidic soil is much lower than the amount of seeds that can sprout in a more neutral pH soil.&lt;ref name=Horne1995/&gt; These limitations to the growth of plants can have a very negative affect on [[plant health]], leading to a decrease in overall plant population.

These effects occur regardless of the [[biome]]. A study in the [[Netherlands]] examined the correlation between [[soil pH]] and soil biodiversity in soils with pH below 5.&lt;ref name=Roem2000&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Roem, WJ  |author2=Berendse, F. |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2000 | title=Soil acidity and nutrient supply ratio as possible factors determining changes in plant species diversity in grassland and heathland communities| journal=Biological Conservation| volume=92| issue=2| pages=151‚Äì161| doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(99)00049-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong correlation was discovered, wherein the lower the pH the lower the biodiversity.&lt;ref name=Roem2000/&gt; The results were the same in grasslands as well as heathlands.&lt;ref name=Roem2000/&gt; Particularly concerning is the evidence showing that this acidification is directly linked to the decline in [[endangered species]] of plants, a trend recognized since 1950.&lt;ref name=Roem2000/&gt;

Soil acidification reduces soil biodiversity. It reduces the numbers of most macrofauna, including, for example, earthworm numbers (important in maintaining structural quality of the [[topsoil]] for plant growth). Also affected is [[rhizobium]] survival and persistence. [[Decomposition]] and [[nitrogen fixation]] may be reduced, which affects the survival of [[indigenous plant|native vegetation]]. Biodiversity may further decline as certain [[weed]]s proliferate under declining native vegetation.&lt;ref name=SlatteryHollier2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hollier, C and Reid, M (2005). Acid Soils. DPI AgNote April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In strongly acidic soils, the associated toxicity may lead to decreased [[plant cover]], leaving the soil susceptible to [[erosion]] by water and wind. Extremely low pH soils may suffer from structural decline as a result of reduced microorganisms and organic matter; this brings a susceptibility to erosion under high [[rainfall]] events, [[drought]], and agricultural disturbance.&lt;ref name=SlatteryHollier2002/&gt;

Some plants within the same species have shown resistance to the soil acidity their population grows in.&lt;ref name=Haling2010/&gt; Selectively breeding the stronger plants is a way for humans to guard against increasing soil acidity.&lt;ref name=Haling2010/&gt;

Further success combatting soil acidity has been seen in [[soybean]] and [[corn]] populations suffering from [[aluminum]] toxicity.&lt;ref name=Joris2013&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Joris, H |author2=Caires, E |author3=Bini, A |author4=Scharr, D |author5=Haliski, A | year=2013| title=Effects of soil acidity and water stress on corn and soybean performance under a no-till system| journal=Plant &amp; Soil |volume=365| issue=1/2| pages=409‚Äì424| doi=10.1007/s11104-012-1413-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil nutrients were restored and acidity decreased when lime was added to the soil.&lt;ref name=Joris2013/&gt; The plant health was increased and root biomass increased in response to the treatment.&lt;ref name=Joris2013/&gt; This is a possible solution for other acidic soil plant populations &lt;ref name=Joris2013/&gt;

===Structure decline===

[[Soil structure]] is the arrangement of particles and associated pores in soils across the size range from nanometres to centimeters. Biological influences can be demonstrated in the formation and stabilization of the soil aggregates, but it is necessary to distinguish clearly between those forces or agencies that create aggregations of particles and those that stabilize or degrade such aggregations.&lt;ref name=Oades1993&gt;{{cite journal| author=Oades, J. M. | year=2010 | title=The role of biology in the formation, stabilization and degradation of soil structure | journal= Geoderma| volume= 56 | issue=1 |pages=377‚Äì400 | doi=10.1016/0016-7061(93)90123-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; What qualifies as good soil contains the following attributes: optimal soil strength and aggregate stability, which offer resistance to structural degradation (capping/crusting, [[slaking (geology)|slaking]] and erosion, for example); optimal bulk density, which aids root development and contributes to other soil physical parameters such as water and air movement within the soil; optimal water holding capacity and rate of water infiltration.&lt;ref name=Shepherd2002&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shepherd, MA |author2=Harrison, R |author3=Webb, J | year=2002 | title= Managing Soil Organic Matter - Implications For Soil Structure On Organic Farms | journal= Soil Use and Management | volume= 18 | issue=1 |pages=284‚Äì292 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-2743.2002.tb00270.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-developed, [[soil health|healthy soils]] are complex systems in which physical soil structure is as important as chemical content. Soil pores‚Äîwhich are maximized in a well-structured soil‚Äîallow oxygen and [[soil moisture|moisture]] to infiltrate to depths and plant roots to penetrate to obtain moisture and nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Aplin, G (1998). Australians and Their Environment: An Introduction to Environmental Studies. Oxford University Press, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological activity helps in the maintenance of relatively open soil structure, as well as facilitating decomposition and the transportation and transformation of soil nutrients. Changing soil structure has been shown to lead to reduced accessibility by plants to necessary substances. It is now uncontested that microbial exudates have a dominant role in the aggregation of soil particles and the protection of carbon from further degradation.&lt;ref name=Six2006&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Six, J. |author2=Frey, S.D. |author3=Thiet, R.K. |author4=Batten, K.M. | year=2006 | title= Bacterial And Fungal Contributions To Carbon Sequestration In Agroecosystems | journal= Soil Sci. Soc | volume= 70 | issue=2 |pages=555‚Äì569 | doi=10.2136/sssaj2004.0347}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that microorganisms within the soil "engineer" a superior habitat and provide a more sound soil structure, leading to more productive soil systems.&lt;ref name= Lutzow2006&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Von Lutzow, M |author2=Kogel-Knabner, I |author3=Ekschmitt, K |author4=Matzner, E |author5=Guggenberger, G |author6=Marschner, B |author7=Flessa, H | year=2006 | title= Stabilization of organic matter in temperate soils: mechanisms and their relevance under different soil conditions‚Äìa review | journal= European Journal of Soil Science | volume= 57 | issue= 4 |pages=426‚Äì445 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2389.2006.00809.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional agricultural practices have generally caused declining soil structure. For example, cultivation causes the mechanical mixing of the soil, compacting and sheering of aggregates and filling of pore spaces - organic matter is also exposed to a greater rate of decay and oxidation.&lt;ref name=YoungYoung2001/&gt; Soil structure is essential to [[soil health]] and fertility; soil structure decline has a direct effect on soil and surface [[food chain]] and biodiversity as a consequence. Continued [[crop cultivation]] eventually results in significant changes within the soil, such as its nutrient status, pH balance, organic matter content, and physical characteristics.&lt;ref name= Powlson2013&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Powlson, D.S. |author2=Gregory, P.J. |author3=Whalley, W.R. |author4=Quinton, J.N. |author5=Hopkins, D.W. |author6=Whitmore, A.P. |author7=Hirsch, P.R. |author8=Goulding, K.W.T. | year=2013 | title= Soil Management In Relation To Sustainable Agriculture And Ecosystem Services | journal= Food Policy | volume= 36 | issue= 1 |pages=572‚Äì587}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of these changes can be beneficial to food and crop production, they can also be harmful towards other necessary systems. For example, studies have shown that [[tillage|tilling]] has had negative consequences towards [[soil organic matter]] (SOM), the organic component of soil composed of plant and animal decomposition and substances synthesized by [[soil organism]]s. SOM plays an integral role in the preservation of soil structure, but the constant tilling of crops has caused the SOM to shift and redistribute, causing soil structure to deteriorate and altering soil organism populations (such as with earthworms).&lt;ref name= Riley2008&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Riley, H |author2=Pommeresche, R |author3=Eltun, R |author4=Hansen, S |author5=Korsaeth, A | year=2008 | title= Soil structure, organic matter and earthworm activity in a comparison of cropping systems with contrasting tillage, rotations, fertilizer levels and manure use.| journal= Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment | volume= 124 | issue= 3 |pages=275‚Äì284 | doi=10.1016/j.agee.2007.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in many parts of the world, maximizing food production at all costs due to rampant [[poverty]] and the lack of [[food security]] tends to leave the long term ecological consequences overlooked, despite research and acknowledgment by the academic community.&lt;ref name="Powlson2013"/&gt;

===Sodicity===

Soil sodicity refers the soil's content of [[sodium]] compared to its content of other [[cation]]s, such as [[calcium]]. In high levels, sodium ions break apart [[clay]] platelets and cause swelling and [[dispersion (geology)|dispersion]] in soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearson|title=The Basics of Salinity and Sodicity}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in reduced soil sustainability. If the concentration occurs repeatedly, the soil becomes [[cement]]-like, with little or no structure.
 
Extended exposure to high sodium levels results in a decrease in the amount of water retained and able to flow through soil, as well as a decrease in decomposition rates (this leaves the soil infertile and prohibit any future growth). This issue is prominent in Australia, where 1/3 of the land is affected by high levels of salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|title=Soils-Sodic and Acidic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a natural occurrence, but farming practices such as [[overgrazing]] and cultivation have contributed to the rise of it. The options for managing sodic soils are very limited; one must either change the plants or change the soil. The latter is the more difficult process. If changing the soil, one must add calcium to absorb the excess sodium that blocks water flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|title=Managing Sodic Soils}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salinisation===

[[Soil salinity]] is the concentration of salt within the soil profile or on the soil surface. Excessive salt directly affects the composition of plants and animals due to varying salt tolerance ‚Äì along with various physical and chemical changes to the soil, including structural decline and, in the extreme, denudation, exposure to soil erosion, and export of salts to waterways. At low soil salinity, there is a lot of microbial activity, that results in an increase in soil respiration, which increases the [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the soil, producing a healthier environment for plants.&lt;ref name=Wong2008&gt;{{cite journal| author=Wong, Vanessa N., Ram C. Dalal and Richard S. Greene| title=Salinity and sodicity effects on respiration and microbial biomass of soil| journal=Biology and Fertility of Soils| volume=44| issue=7|year =2008 |pages=943‚Äì953| doi=10.1007/s00374-008-0279-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the salinity of the soil rises, there is more stress on microbes because there is less available water available to them, leading to less respiration.&lt;ref name=Wong2008/&gt; Soil salinity has localised and regional effects on biodiversity, ranging, for example, from changes in [[plant composition]] and survival at a local discharge site through to regional changes in [[water quality]] and [[aquatic life]].

While very saline soil is not preferred for growing crops, it is important to note that many crops can grow in more saline soils then others.&lt;ref name=Singh2012&gt;{{cite journal| author=Singh, A. &amp; Panda, S.N. |title=Effect of saline irrigation water on mustard (''Brassica juncea'') crop yield and soil salinity in a semi-arid area of north India| journal=Experimental Agriculture |volume=48| issue=1 |year=2012| pages=99‚Äì110 | doi=10.1017/s0014479711000780|last2=Panda}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important in countries where resources such as [[fresh water]] are scarce and needed for drinking, and saline water is able to be used for agriculture.&lt;ref name=Singh2012/&gt; Soil salinity can vary between extremes in a relatively small area;&lt;ref name=Bazihizina2012&gt;{{cite journal| author=Bazihizina, N., Barrett-Lennard, E.G. &amp; Colmer, T.D.. | title=Plant growth and physiology under heterogeneous salinity| journal=Plant and Soil |year=2012 | pages=1‚Äì19 | doi = 10.1007/s11104-012-1193-8 | volume=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; this allows plants to seek areas with less salinity. It is hard to determine which plants are able to grow in soil with high salinity, because the soil salinity is not uniform, even in small areas.&lt;ref name=Bazihizina2012/&gt; However, plants absorb nutrients from areas with lower salinity.&lt;ref name=Bazihizina2012/&gt;

===Erosion===
[[File:Eroding rill in field in eastern Germany.jpg|thumb|upright|An actively eroding [[rill]] on an [[Intensive farming|intensively-farmed]] field in  [[Germany]]]]
{{main|Soil erosion}}

[[Soil erosion]] is the removal of the soil's upper layers by the action of water, wind, or ice. Soil erosion occurs naturally, but [[Erosion#Human activities that increase erosion rates|human activities]] can greatly increase its severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunn|first=Margery G.|title=Exploring Your World: The Adventure of Geography|origyear=1989|year=1993|publisher=National Geographic Society|location=Washington, D.C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil that is healthy is [[soil fertility|fertile]] and productive.&lt;ref name=Sainju2002&gt;Sainju, U.M, B.P Singh, and W.F Whitehead. "Long-term effects of tillage, cover crops, and nitrogen fertilization on organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations in sandy loam soils in Georgia, USA." Soil and Tillage Research 63.3-4 (2002): 167-79.&lt;/ref&gt; But soil erosion leads to a loss of topsoil, organic matter, and nutrients; it breaks down soil structure and decreases water storage capacity, in turn reducing fertility and the availability of water to plant roots. Soil erosion is therefore a major threat to soil biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;NSW Government, 2006, New South Wales State of the Environment 2006, Chapter 4: Land, viewed July 2007, [http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/SOE/soe2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catchment scale impacts==

Biological systems‚Äîboth natural and artificial‚Äîdepend heavily on healthy soils; it is the maintenance of [[soil health]] and [[fertility (soil)|fertility]] in all of its dimensions that sustains life. The interconnection spans vast spatial and temporal scales; the major degradation issues of salinity and soil erosion, for instance, can have anywhere from local to regional effects ‚Äì it may take decades for the consequences of management actions affecting soil to be realised in terms of biodiversity impact.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Maintaining soil health is a regional or catchment-scale issue. Because soils are a dispersed asset, the only effective way is to ensure soil health generally is to encourage a broad, consistent, and economically appealing approach. Examples of such approaches as applied to an agricultural setting include the application of lime ([[calcium carbonate]]) to reduce acidity so to increase soil health and production, and the transition from conventional farming practices that employ cultivation to limited or no-till systems, which has had a positive impact on improving soil structure.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Monitoring and mapping==

Soils encompass a huge diversity of organisms which makes biodiversity difficult to measure. It is estimated that a football pitch contains underground as much organisms as equal to the size of 500 sheep. A first step has been taken in identifying areas where soil biodiversity is most under pressure is to find the main proxies which decrease soil biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orgiazzi|first=Alberto|last2=Panagos|first2=Panos|last3=Yigini|first3=Yusuf|last4=Dunbar|first4=Martha B.|last5=Gardi|first5=Ciro|last6=Montanarella|first6=Luca|last7=Ballabio|first7=Cristiano|title=A knowledge-based approach to estimating the magnitude and spatial patterns of potential threats to soil biodiversity|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S004896971531247X|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=545-546|pages=11‚Äì20|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil biodiversity will be measured in the future, especially thanks to the development of molecular approaches relying on direct DNA extraction from the soil matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orgiazzi|first=Alberto|last2=Dunbar|first2=Martha Bonnet|last3=Panagos|first3=Panos|last4=Groot|first4=Gerard Arjen de|last5=Lemanceau|first5=Philippe|title=Soil biodiversity and DNA barcodes: opportunities and challenges|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0038071714003617|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|volume=80|pages=244‚Äì250|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.10.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Specific kinetic energy''' is [[kinetic energy]] of an object per unit of mass.

It is defined as &lt;math&gt; \begin{matrix} e_k = \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} v^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Where &lt;math&gt;e_k&lt;/math&gt; is the specific kinetic energy and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is velocity. It has units of J/kg, which is equivalent to m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Staple''' refers to [[fiber|fibre]] of discrete length and may be of any composition.  A continuous fibre such as natural [[silk]] or synthetic is known as filament rather than staple fibre.

==Etymology==
[[Back-formation]] arising because part of the business of a [[wool-stapler]] was [[Wool classing|to sort and class]] the wool according to [[Wool measurement|quality]]. According to [[Chambers Dictionary]] the actual word "staple" including staple foods and other products comes from the [[Low German]] word ''Stapel'' meaning a heap of goods to be sold.&lt;ref&gt;"staple, n.3". ''OED Online''. June 2011. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staple length==
[[File:PSM V39 D189 Magnified fibers of silk wool and cotton.jpg|thumb|right|Magnified fibres of silk, wool, and cotton]]
Staple length, a property of staple [[fiber|fibre]], is a term referring to the average length of a group of fibres of any composition. Staple length depends on the origin of the fibres. [[Natural fibers|Natural fibres]] (such as [[cotton]] or [[wool]]) have a range of lengths in each sample, so the staple length is an average. For [[synthetic fibers|synthetic fibres]] which have been cut to a certain length, the staple length is the same for every fibre in the group. 

Staple length is an important criterion for [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] fibre, as shorter fibres are more difficult to spin than longer ones, so staple length varies from short to longer length fibres, short fibers  also resulting in more hairy yarns. 

For cotton and wool, staple length was originally tested by hand, the tester removing a clump of fibre and then arranging it on a dark cloth for measurement. In the 1970s, machines were invented to do this task, taking around 5 minutes for cotton and for wool around 20 minutes. Today, machinery can take the measurement in seconds.

==Filament==
The opposite term is '''filament''' fibre, which is [[fibre]] that comes in continuous to near continuous lengths for use. [[Silk]], taken from the cocoon of a silkworm, is a filament. Synthetic fibres can also be manufactured as filament. If the filament is then cut into discrete lengths, it becomes staple fibre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3297">In [[astronomy]], a '''superhump''' is a periodic brightness variation in a [[cataclysmic variable star]] system, with a period within a few percent of the [[orbital period]] of the system.

==History==
Superhumps were first seen in [[SU Ursae Majoris]] (SU UMa) stars, a subclass of [[dwarf nova]]e, at times when the binary system underwent a superoutburst, which is an unusually strong outburst (increase in brightness) caused by an increased [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] rate.&lt;ref name=retter/&gt;

==Period excess==
The period of the superhump variations can be either greater or less than the orbital period, known as positive or negative superhumps respectively.  The period excess is the difference between the superhump period and the orbital period, expressed as a fraction of the orbital period.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt;

==Physical origin==
The [[accretion disk]] is elongated by the [[tidal force]] of the donor star. The elliptical disk [[precession|precesses]] around the [[white dwarf]] accretor over a time interval much longer than the orbital period, the beat period, causing a slight change in the orientation of the disk over each orbit.&lt;ref name=pearson/&gt; Superhumps in cataclysmic variable stars are the result of [[viscosity|viscous]] [[dissipation]] by periodic deformations of the disk. These deformations are caused by the presence of a 3:1 [[resonance]] between the orbital periods of the accretion disk and the donor star.  Retrograde precession of the disk causes negative superhumps, with periods slightly less than the orbital period.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt;

Superhumps can occur in dwarf nova systems in which the [[donor star]] (mass-losing star) has a mass that is at most 34 percent the mass of the accretor star (mass-gaining star).&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; The amplitude can be up to 0.6 [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]].&lt;ref name=smak/&gt;

'''Ten Ten-Vilu''' or '''Trentren-Vilu''' (from [[Mapudungun]] ''Trengtrengfilu'': ''Trengtreng'' a name, and ''filu'' "snake") is the [[Mapuche]] god of Earth and Fertility (or [[goddess]] in some versions found in Chilo√©); he has a generous spirit and is the protector of all life on Earth, and the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] and according to some Mapuche myths (later also found in [[Chilo√©]]). This snake was a central figure in the [[Chilo√© (mytological origin)|Origin Of The Chiloean Archipelago]]. In [[Mapuche mythology]], Ten Ten-Vilu is son of ''[[Antu (mapuche mythology)|A&lt;u&gt;nt&lt;/u&gt;√º]]'' (a [[Pillan]] spirit).

The ecoregion forms an area of temperate broadleaf forest covering {{convert|55900|sqkm|mi2}} in a narrow band between {{convert|1500|to|2600|m|ft}} elevation, extending from the [[Gandaki River]] gorge in Nepal, through [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]] in northern India, into disputed area of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and parts of Pakistan. This ecoregion is drier and the forest is more fragmented than its [[Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests]] counterpart, which receive more moisture from the [[Bay of Bengal]] monsoon but is still valuable habitat especially as part of the pattern of habitats found at different elevations on the Himalayan mountainsides. Many species of birds and animals migrate up and down the mountains seasonally from the grasslands of the plains below to the high peaks. 

At lower elevations, this ecoregion grades into [[Himalayan subtropical pine forests]]. At higher elevations, it grades into [[Western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]] as well as [[Northwestern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]] and [[Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Western Himalayan broadleaf forests|id=im0403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The Western Himalayan broadleaf forests may be divided into forests of two types: evergreen and deciduous broadleaved forests.

The evergreen broadleaf forest is dominated by [[Quercus|oak]]s, consisting of ''[[Quercus semecarpifolia]], [[Quercus leucotrichophora]], [[Quercus floribunda]], [[Quercus glauca]] and [[Quercus baloot]].'' This forest is typically found on moister southern slopes, which are more influenced by the [[monsoon]]. Various [[Lauraceae]] call this forest home, including ''[[Machilus odoratissima]], [[Litsea umbrosa]], [[Litsea lanuginosa]]'', and ''[[Phoebe pulcherrima]]''. The understory features a rich assemblage of ferns, mosses, and [[epiphyte]]s. On northern slopes, drier areas, and higher elevations, conifers like ''[[Abies]], [[Picea]], [[Cedrus]]'', and ''[[Pinus]]'' thrives''.'' The wild olive, ' '[[olea cuspidata]]'' is found here too.

The deciduous forest is found along rivers west of the [[Gandaki River]]. It includes ''[[Aesculus indica]]'', ''[[Juglans regia]], [[Carpinus viminea]]'', ''[[Alnus nepalensis]]'', and several ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'' species like [[Acer caesium]], [[Acer acuminatum]], etc are found. In drier areas such as the valley of the upper [[Ghaghara River]] it includes ''[[Populus ciliata]]'', ''[[Ulmus wallichiana]]'', and ''[[Corylus colurna]]'' as well and the riverbanks are dominated by Himalayan alder (''[[Alnus nitida]]'').

==Fauna==
Although there is less wildlife here than in the wetter Eastern Himalayas, this ecoregion is home to seventy-six species of mammals. These include the [[Asiatic black bear]], [[Panthera pardus|leopard]], the [[Hemitragus jemlahicus|Himalayan tahr]], and the threatened [[Himalayan serow]] (Capricornis thar). There is one endemic mammal, the [[Kashmir cave bat]] (''Myotis longipes'') while the threatened [[Peter's tube-nosed bat]] (''Murina grisea'') is near-endemic.

About 315 species of birds have been recorded in this ecoregion from tiny warblers to large pheasants such as the [[western tragopan]] (''Tragopan melanocephalus''), [[satyr tragopan]] (''Tragopan satyra''), [[koklass pheasant]] (''Pucrasia macrolopha''), [[Himalayan monal]] (''Lophophorus impejanus'') and [[cheer pheasant]] (''Catreus wallichi''). Near-endemic birds of the forests include the [[white-cheeked tit]], [[white-throated tit]], [[spectacled finch]], [[Kashmir flycatcher]], [[Tytler's leaf-warbler]], [[orange bullfinch]], and [[Kashmir nuthatch]], while the [[Himalayan quail]] which used to be found here is now thought to be extinct.

==Threats and conservation==
The Himalayas receive large numbers of visitors every year including religious pilgrims and trekkers. Although there a large number of protected areas each of them are quite small and most of original forest has been cleared for [[logging]] or for agricultural land, a process which is ongoing. Only a third remains unspoilt, with the largest patches remaining in the west of the ecoregion and any forest clearance on these steep mountainsides quickly results in soil erosion and oversilting of the rivers below. Protected areas in this ecoregion include [[Askot Musk Deer Sanctuary]], and parts of the [[Govind Pashu Vihar Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Rupi Bhabha Sanctuary]] and the large [[Kishtwar National Park]].

The '''Xiangshuishen''' or '''Xiang River Goddesses''' are goddesses (or spirits, and sometimes gods) of the [[Xiang River]] in [[Chinese folk religion]]. The Xiang flowed into [[Dongting Lake]] through the ancient kingdom of [[Chu (state)|Chu]], whose songs in their worship have been recorded in a work attributed to [[Qu Yuan]]. According to ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' the Xiang River deities were daughters of the supreme deity, [[Shangdi|Di]]. According to a somewhat later tradition, the Xiang goddesses were daughters of the [[Emperor Yao]], who were named '''Ehuang''' ({{zh|c=Â®•Áöá|p=√â Hu√°ng}}; Fairy Radiance) and '''N√ºying''' ({{zh|c=Â•≥Ëã±|p=N«ö Yƒ´ng}}; Maiden Bloom){{sfnp|Murck|2000|p=9}} who were said to have been married by him to his chosen successor, and eventually emperor, [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]], as a sort of test of his administrative abilities: then, later, they became goddesses, after the death of their husband.

==Shun's wives==
[[File:Â∏ùËàú.png|thumb|Shun]]
[[File:E Huang and N√º Ying.jpg|thumb|E Huang and N√º Ying, Qing dynasty, China]]

Mythologically, according to the Ehuang-Nuying version, sometime in the twenty-third century BCE, before becoming divine goddesses, according to mythology, the two daughters of the emperor Yao, Ehuang and N√ºying, were married to Shun, according to the plan of their father, Yao. Although later destined to be emperor and exemplar of all the virtues desirable in an emperor and exemplar for all future ages, before the marriage Shun was a simple farmer. Yao, however, was attempting to recruit worthy persons into the service of his government, the main reason being to solve the problem of the ongoing [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]] that was devastating China. One suggestion from Yao's advisors ([[Four Mountains]]) was Shun. Yao inquired what sort of a person was Shun, and decided to try him upon being told that (although a direct lineal descendant of [[Zhuanxu]]) Shun the farmer was the son of Gu (also known as Gusou), a mean, violent, stupid, and difficult man (also old and blind optically and morally); that Shun lived with him and his proudful and abusive stepmother; and, a half brother, Xiang (who was evil) -- but nevertheless, due to the young (early thirties, but old to be unmarried) Shun's great [[filial piety]] the inherent wickedness of the family was kept in-check and outright evil avoided. In an early example of the [[imperial examinations in Chinese mythology]], Yao decided to test the merit of Shun. According to [[Zhou Dunyi]] and others, as a test for Shun, Yao married his two daughters Ehuang and Nuying to him, and Shun took home his brides. The arrival of the future Xiang River Goddesses, Ehuang and Nuying provoked numerous problems: Shun's father had little or no liking for him, his step mother had no love for him, both wanted to seize his dowry of flocks of sheep and other cattle and huge measures of grains which he had received as a part of  the marriage, and his half brother Xiang just wanted to kill him and take his wives and some of his other possessions for himself. Shun's father, stepmother, and half brother decided to murder Shun. One day Shun's father, Gu, asked him to repair the roof of a barn, which Shun mentioned to his wives. Ehuang and Nuying warned him of the murder attempt, and gave him a magical bird coat. Once Shun was up on the barn roof, his father, old Gu, set the barn on fire and took away the ladder; however, with the aid of the magical bird coat Shun flew to safety. Next, they tried to murder him in a well; but, again Ehuang and Nuying had prepared him for survival with a magical dragon coat which allowed him to swim out through a tunnel. Again, Ehuang and Nuying saved Shun from his murderous relatives by giving him a magically antidotal bath which foiled a plot to get him drunk and murder him. There are many versions of this mythology, and some of them omit the wives Ehuang and Nuying. In any case, Yao was well pleased with Shun's observed behavior, who maintained his filial piety while preserving his own interests as well, and so he promoted Shun into his civil service (which also allowed, or obligated, Shun together with Ehuang and Nuying to leave his home and murderous family behind). Later on, after Shun was promoted to emperor, Ehuang and Nuying were said to continue to provide Shun with invaluable advice contributing to his great success. (Murck 2000, 8-9; Wu 1982, 70-71; Yang and others 2005, 202-204).

==Legend of the spotted bamboo==
{{Main|Spotted bamboo}}
[[File:BanZhu Bamboo.jpg|thumb|BanZhu Bamboo|Spotted bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides f. lacrima-deae Keng &amp; Wen), also known as {{CJKV|t=ÊñëÁ´π|s=ÊñëÁ´π|p=bƒÅnzh√∫|l=spotted bamboo}} or {{CJKV|t=ÊπòÂ¶ÉÁ´π|s=ÊπòÂ¶ÉÁ´π|p=XiƒÅngfƒìi zh√∫l=Xiang consort bamboo}}.]]
The spots that appear on the stems of certain bamboos legendarily first appeared on the bamboo growing by the [[Xiang River]], caused by the tears which fell upon them, shed by Ehuang and Nuying, the two Xiang River goddesses, mourning the disappearance and presumed death of their beloved husband, the Emperor and hero Shun. There are various versions of this mythological story; but, according to one version, in the last year of his reign Shun decided to tour the country of the Xiang River area. According to another version he was engaged in a military expedition versus the "[[Miao people|Miao]]". Upon his sudden death during this journey, in the "Wilderness of [[Cangwu County|Cangwu]]", near the headwaters of the Xiang River in the [[Jiuyi Mountains]] (sometimes translated as Doubting Mountain),&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes, 335-336&lt;/ref&gt; both of his wives rushed from home to his body (or, in another version, to look for it, but were unable to find it), and then they wept by the river for days: their copious tears falling upon the bamboos by the river, stained them permanently with their spots.

==The First Qin Emperor and Xiang Jun==
[[File:8 Famous Sights of Xiao &amp; Xiang Rivers by Yokoyama Taikan (TNM) - Autumn Moon over Lake Dongting.jpg|thumb|"Autumn Moon over Dongting Lake", the lake where the Xiang River Goddesses island shrine was located. By [[Yokoyama Taikan]], from a set of [[Eight Views of Xiaoxiang]].]]

According to [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian|History]]'' (Ch.6, "Annals of the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Qin Emperor]]"), in the 28th year of his reign (219 BCE), the Qin Emperor went on an excursion, wishing to visit the holy mountain of [[Mount Heng (Hunan)|Heng]] (the southernmost of the [[Sacred Mountains of China|Five Sacred Mountains of China]], in present-day in Hunan). However, while attempting to travel there by boat, the emperor suddenly encountered a great wind which nearly prevented his safely reaching land (much less reaching his destination). The incident took place near the shrine of Xiang Jun (on [[Junshan Island|Xiangshan]], now an island in [[Dongting Lake]]). Upon inquiring about identity of Xiang Jun, the emperor learned that the name referred to the daughters of Yao and the wives of Shun who were buried at this location. Before returning home (by the different [[Wu Pass]] land route), the enraged emperor ordered 3000 convict laborers to cut down all of the trees on this mountain, and then to paint the entire mountain red.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Murck|2000|p=10}} Part of the reason for the Qin emperor's fury was that the Xiang goddess(es) were patron deities of his old enemies of the [[Chu (state)|Kingdom of Chu]]; the color red was intended to symbolize the color of the clothing mandated for convicted criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
