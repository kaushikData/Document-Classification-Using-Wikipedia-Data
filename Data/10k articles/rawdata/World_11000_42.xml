The '''72nd Infantry Division''' ({{lang-fr|72e Division d'Infanterie, 72e DI}}) was a [[French Army]] formation during [[World War I]].

The division was a reserve formation of the French Army, based at [[Verdun]]. It was mobilised on 2 August 1914. On mobilisation it commanded the 351st, 362nd, 364th, 365th, and 366th Infantry Regiments and the 56th and 59th Battalions of Chasseurs à Pied. It formed part of the garrison of the Verdun fortress and was subordinated to the French 3rd Army.

The division remained in the Verdun region until August 1916 (during which it participated in the [[Battle of Verdun]]), when it was then moved north, where it then participated in the [[Battle of the Somme]]. In 1918 the division took part in the [[Second Battle of the Marne]].

At the end of the war, only the 365th Infantry Regiment of the original force remained with the division, the other units having been posted away, amalgamated, or disbanded. In addition to this, the 1st Mixed Regiment of Zouaves and Tirailleurs, and the 31st Territorial Infantry Regiment formed part of the division.

At various times, it was part of the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]], [[Second Army (France)|French Second Army]], [[Third Army (France)|French Third Army]], [[Fourth Army (France)|French Fourth Army]], [[Fifth Army (France)|French Fifth Army]], [[Sixth Army (France)|French Sixth Army]], [[Seventh Army (France)|French Seventh Army]], [[Tenth Army (France)|French Tenth Army]], Army of the Lorraine, GQGA and the Fortified Region of Verdun.

'''AK-Momo''' are a musical duo from [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. They met through mutual friends at a bar in central Stockholm. Olsson invited Malmborg to his studio for a visit. The group consists of [[Anna Karin von Malmborg|Anna Karin ('AK') von Malmborg]] ([[vocals]], [[Optigan]] and [[whistling]]) and [[Mattias Olsson]] ([[Optigan]], [[Mellotron]] and [[Orchestron]]). The band formed in July 2003 and recorded the basis for their debut album ''Return to NY'' in six afternoons writing two songs every time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The music is based around the sounds in the Roth Händle studio. After the initial six afternoons Olsson then recorded additional overdubs with the Mellotrons, Optigans and Orchestrons and mixed the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=AK-Momo - Return To N.Y. - A Hidden Agenda Record |url=http://www.parasol.com/labels/hiddenagenda/aha071.asp |accessdate=8 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107035439/http://www.parasol.com/labels/hiddenagenda/aha071.asp |archivedate=7 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have been compared to [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]] for their use of vintage synth instruments (and most undoubtedly for letting their inner [[John Barry (composer)]] out of the proverbial cage), [[Kate Bush]] for the vocals and [[Felt Mountain]] era [[Goldfrapp]].

"'''A luta é alegria'''" (''The struggle is joy'') was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011]] in [[Germany]], performed by [[Homens da Luta]]. It was chosen for Eurovision by winning the [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|Festival da Canção 2011]] on 5 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/musica/musica/homens-da-luta/1151639-4060.html |title=IOL Música - Homens da Luta lançam álbum em formato mp3 |publisher=Tvi24.iol.pt |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not progress beyond the semi-final.

==Background==

===Production history===
"A luta é alegria" was composed by Vasco Duarte, while the lyrics were written by Jel. The song incorporates [[Music of Portugal|folk music]] style.

===Song meaning===
The song refers to the struggle that the people must endure to have their voices heard, by shouting and celebrating on the street. It calls for the union of the people, and to sing against [[Reactionary|reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurovisiontimes.wordpress.com/esc-2011/participants/portugal-homens-da-luta-a-luta-e-alegria/ |title=Portugal: Homens Da Luta – A Luta é Alegria « The Eurovision Times |publisher=Eurovisiontimes.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The performers==
Homens da Luta (Men of the Struggle) is a collective of traditional Portuguese music of an interventionist style. Inspired by the musical universe of the period after [[Carnation Revolution|April 25, 1974]], the band is led by the unavoidable Neto and Falâncio (brothers Nuno "Jel" and Vasco Duarte), and first appeared on TV five years ago in a comedy show. However, soon they were travelling through the cities, towns, and villages of Portugal, spreading their music and their sense of humour. They bring "A Luta É Alegria (The Struggle is Joy)" to the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest, inspired by the tradition of collective singing, which was so fashionable in Portugal in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/year/participant-profile/?song=25913 |title=Eurovision: Participant profile |publisher=Eurovision.tv |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Women's War Relief Fund''' was an [[expatriate]] organization in the [[United Kingdom]] started by [[United States|American]] women to fund and aid [[World War I]] support efforts. The group was made up of wealthy [[Socialite|socialites]], politicians' wives and [[Humanitarianism|humanitarians]]. Many famous and well-connected women were involved, including [[Lou Henry Hoover|Lou Hoover]], [[Consuelo Vanderbilt]] and [[Lady Randolph Churchill]]. [[Louise Paget|Leila Paget]]  served as president and  [[Ava Lowle Willing]] was the fund's vice-president. The group, started almost immediately after the declaration of war, funded a fleet of [[Ambulance|ambulances]], two [[Hospital|hospitals]], one [[field hospital]] and several employment opportunities for unemployed women in Britain.

The American Women's War Relief Fund was founded on August 5, 1914.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4fe9YQ-iMlEC&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=%22american%20women's%20war%20relief%20fund%22&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q=%22american%20women's%20war%20relief%20fund%22&amp;f=false|title=Excluded from the Record: Women, Refugees, and Relief, 1914-1929|last=Storr|first=Katherine|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2009|isbn=9783039118557|location=|pages=112|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the organization were women from the [[United States]] who were married to [[English people|Englishmen]] and who wanted to help in the effort to support soldiers fighting in [[World War I]].{{sfn|Stanley|1915|p=11}} The president of the group was [[Louise Paget|Leila Paget]] and [[Ava Lowle Willing]] served as vice-president.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Many of the members of the group had husbands who were commanding troops during the war.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19595784/|title=Every American Woman in England Working to Help Victims of War|last=Church|first=Hayden|date=6 October 1914|work=The Atlanta Constitution|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paget told journalist Hayden Church that she had thought up the idea for the Relief Fund merely three days after the start of the war.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Winnaretta Singer]] and the Countess of Starfford were major donors of money to the fund.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Paget also raised money in both America and England for wounded soldiers of several different countries fighting in the war.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19614489/|title=Women Found War Hospitals|last=|first=|date=21 June 1917|work=Harrisburg Telegraph|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, there was an official request to have all American-led efforts to support the war in Europe be turned over to the [[American Red Cross]] for coordination purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19614763/|title=American Women's War Relief Fund|last=|first=|date=24 November 1917|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1918, the Relief Fund hospitals were fully turned over to be run by the Red Cross.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://americanwomeninwwi.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/helping-in-britain-the-american-womens-war-relief-fund/|title=Helping in Britain: The American Women’s War Relief Fund.|last=|first=|date=2017-01-09|work=American Women in World War I|access-date=2018-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927022703/https://americanwomeninwwi.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/helping-in-britain-the-american-womens-war-relief-fund/|archive-date=27 September 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|Europhobia}}
'''Anti-Europeanism''' and '''Europhobia''' are political terms used in a variety of contexts, implying sentiment or policies in opposition to [[Europe]].

In the context of racial or ethno-nationalist politics, this may refer to the [[culture of Europe|culture]] or [[peoples of Europe|peoples]] of Europe (c.f. [[reverse racism|anti-white sentiment in the United States]]); 
In the shorthand of "Europe" standing for the [[European Union]] or [[European integration]], it may refer to [[Euroscepticism]], 
criticism of policies of European governments or the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/europhobia |title=Europhobia definition and meaning |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the context of United States foreign policy, it may refer to the geopolitical divide between "[[Transatlantic relations|transatlantic]]", "transpacific" and "hemispheric" (pan-American) relations.
The nominal antonyms would be ''[[pro-Europeanism]]'' or ''Europhilia''.{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

"Europhobia" is used of [[United Kingdom|British]] attitudes towards [[Continental Europe|the Continent]], either in the context of [[anti-German sentiment]] or of [[anti-Catholicism]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Miles in: Avril Horner (ed.), ''European Gothic: A Spirited Exchange 1760-1960'' (2002),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=ofIS6ZAdsZAC&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]
Thérèse Remus, ''Germanophobia, Europhobia, Xenophobia – About Stereotypes in Anglo-German Relations'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
or, more recently, of [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom]].

Armenia is a unitary, multi-party, democratic [[Nation state|nation-state]] with an ancient cultural heritage. [[Urartu]] was established in 860 BC and by the 6th century BC it was replaced by the [[Satrapy of Armenia]]. The [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] reached its height under [[Tigranes the Great]] in the 1st century BC and became the first state in the world to adopt [[Christianity]] as its [[State religion|official religion]] in the late 3rd or early 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book |last=Garsoïan|first=Nina|title=Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times|editor=R.G.

See [[Timeline of official adoptions of Christianity]].&lt;/ref&gt; The official date of state adoption of Christianity is 301.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Grousset|title=Histoire de l'Arménie|publisher=Payot|year=1947|edition=1984|page=122}}. Estimated dates vary from 284 to 314. Garsoïan (''op.cit.'' p. 82), following the research of Ananian, favours the latter.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Armenian kingdom was split between the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sasanian Empire]]s around the early 5th century. Under the [[Bagratuni dynasty]], the [[Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia]] was restored in the 9th century. Declining due to the wars against the Byzantines, the kingdom fell in 1045 and Armenia was soon after invaded by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]]. An Armenian principality and later a kingdom [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilician Armenia]] was located on the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] between the 11th and 14th centuries.

Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the traditional Armenian homeland composed of [[Eastern Armenia]] and [[Western Armenia]] came under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Persian Empire|Iranian]] empires, repeatedly ruled by either of the two over the centuries. By the 19th century, Eastern Armenia had been conquered by the [[Russian Empire]], while most of the western parts of the traditional Armenian homeland remained under Ottoman rule. During [[World War I]], Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were systematically exterminated in the [[Armenian Genocide]]. In 1918, following the [[Russian Revolution]], all non-Russian countries declared their independence after the Russian Empire ceased to exist, leading to the establishment of the [[First Republic of Armenia]]. By 1920, the state was incorporated into the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]], and in 1922 became a founding member of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1936, the Transcaucasian state was dissolved, transforming its constituent states, including the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]], into full [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union republics]]. The modern Republic of Armenia became independent in 1991 during the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

Armenia recognises the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the world's oldest national church, as the country's primary religious establishment.&lt;ref&gt;The republic has [[separation of church and state]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.am/en/constitution-2015/|title=Constitution of Armenia, Article 18|publisher=president.am}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unique [[Armenian alphabet]] was invented by [[Mesrop Mashtots]] in 405 AD.

Armenia is a member of the [[Eurasian Economic Union]], the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Collective Security Treaty Organization]]. Armenia supports the de facto independent [[Republic of Artsakh]], which was proclaimed in 1991.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of Armenia}}
The original native [[Armenian language|Armenian]] name for the country was {{lang|hy|Հայք}} (''{{lang|hy-Latn|[[wikt:Հայք|Hayk’]]}}''), however it is currently rarely used. The contemporary name {{lang|hy|Հայաստան}} (''[[wikt:Հայաստան|Hayastan]]'') became popular in the [[Middle Ages]] by addition of the [[Persian language|Persian]] suffix ''[[-stan]]'' (place).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}. However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of [[Agathangelos]],&lt;ref&gt;Ագաթանգեղոս §§ 13 (ի Հայաստան աշխարհէս), 16 (Հայաստան աշխարհիս 2x, ի Հայաստան աշխարհիս), 35 (Հայաստան աշխարհին), 160 (Հայաստան աշխարհիս), 249 (Հայաստան աշխարհիս), 715 (Հայաստան աշխարհիս), 776 (Հայաստան աշխարհին), 784 (Հայաստան աշխարհին), 796 (ի մէջ Հայաստան աշխարհի), 808 (հասանէին ի Հայաստան աշխարհն)։&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ագաթանգեղոս § 885 (ի Հայաստան երկրին)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faustus of Byzantium]],&lt;ref&gt;Փաւստոս Բուզանդ 1883=1984, էջ 1 (Հայաստան աշխարհին)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Փաւստոս Բուզանդ 1883=1984, 4.բ, էջ 56 (Հայաստան երկրին)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghazar Parpetsi]],&lt;ref&gt;904=1985, էջ 2 (Հայաստան աշխարհիս), 110 (կանայս ի Հայաստան աշխարհիս)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Koryun]],&lt;ref&gt;Կորիւն 1994, էջ 83 (Հայաստան աշխարհի), 93 (Հայաստան աշխարհին), 103 (ի Հայաստան աշխարհին), 120 (ի Հայաստան աշխարհէս)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sebeos]].&lt;ref&gt;ժը (սեռ. Հայաստանեայց, բացառ. ի Հայաստանեայց), տես Աբգարյան 1979, էջ 66, 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The name has traditionally been derived from [[Hayk]] ({{lang|hy|Հայկ}}), the legendary patriarch of the [[Armenians]] and a great-great-grandson of [[Noah]], who, according to the 5th-century AD author [[Moses of Chorene]], defeated the [[List of Kings of Babylon|Babylonian king]] Bel in [[3rd millennium BC|2492&amp;nbsp;BC]] and established his nation in the [[Ararat, Armenia|Ararat]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Razmik Panossian, The Armenians: From Kings And Priests to Merchants And Commissars, [[Columbia University Press]] (2006), {{ISBN|978-0-231-13926-7}}, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The further origin of the name is uncertain. It is also further postulated&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Ishkhanyan, "Illustrated History of Armenia," Yerevan, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;Elisabeth Bauer. ''Armenia: Past and Present'' (1981), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; that the name ''Hay'' comes from one of the two confederated, Hittite vassal states—the [[Hayasa|Ḫayaša]]-Azzi (1600–1200 BC).

The [[exonym and endonym|exonym]] ''Armenia'' is attested in the [[Old Persian]] [[Behistun Inscription]] (515 BC) as ''[[wikt:𐎠𐎼𐎷𐎡𐎴#Old Persian|Armina]]'' ([[File:Old Persian a.png|30x20pxpx]] [[File:Old Persian ra.png|30x20pxpx]] [[File:Old Persian mi.png|30x20pxpx]] [[File:Old Persian i.png|30x20pxpx]] [[File:Old Persian na.png|30x20pxpx]]). The [[Ancient Greek]] terms {{wikt-lang|grc|Ἀρμενία}} (''Armenía'') and {{wikt-lang|grc|Ἀρμένιος|Ἀρμένιοι}} (''Arménioi'', "Armenians") are first mentioned by [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] (c. 550 BC – c. 476 BC).&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|grc|Χαλύβοισι πρὸς νότον Ἀρμένιοι ὁμουρέουσι}} (The Armenians border on the [[Chalybes]] to the south)".

He relates that the people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the [[Persian people|Persians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Xenophon]]|title=Anabasis|pages=IV.v.2–9|title-link=Anabasis (Xenophon)}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the histories of both Moses of Chorene and Michael Chamchian, ''Armenia'' derives from the name of [[Aram (given name)|Aram]], a lineal descendant of Hayk.&lt;ref&gt;Moses of Chorene,[http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/khorenaci/index.html ''The History of Armenia''], Book 1, Ch. 12 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=battles&gt;''History of Armenia'' by Father Michael Chamich from B.C. 2247 to the Year of Christ 1780, or 1229 of the Armenian era, Bishop's College Press, Calcutta, 1827, p. 19: "[Aram] was the first to raise the Armenian name to any degree of renown; so that contemporary nations... called them the Aramians, or followers of [[Aram (given name)|Aram]], a name which has been corrupted into Armenians; and the country they inhabited, by universal consent, took the name of Armenia."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Table of Nations]] lists [[Aram, son of Shem|Aram]] as the son of [[Shem]], to whom the [[Book of Jubilees]] attests, &lt;blockquote&gt;"And for Aram there came forth the fourth portion, all the land of Mesopotamia between the Tigris and the Euphrates to the north of the Chaldees to the border of the mountains of Asshur and the land of 'Arara."&lt;ref&gt;Charles, R.H.

The historian Flavius Josephus also states in his [[Antiquities of the Jews]], &lt;blockquote&gt;"Aram had the Aramites, which the Greeks called [[Syrians]];... Of the four sons of Aram, Uz founded [[Trachonitis]] and [[Damascus]]: this country lies between [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]] and [[Celesyria]].

Armenia lies in the highlands surrounding the mountains of [[Mount Ararat|Ararat]]. There is evidence of an early civilisation in Armenia in the [[Bronze Age]] and earlier, dating to about 4000 BC. Archaeological surveys in 2010 and 2011 at the [[Areni-1 cave complex]] have resulted in the discovery of [[Areni-1 shoe|the world's earliest known leather shoe]],&lt;ref name="CNNc"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[CNN]] |title=Armenian cave yields what may be world's oldest leather shoe|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/06/09/armenia.old.shoe/ |date=9 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; skirt,&lt;ref name=strawskirt&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.am/eng/news/73915.html |title = 5,900-year-old women's skirt discovered in Armenian cave |work = News Armenia |date = 13 September 2011 |accessdate = 14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Areni-1 winery|wine-producing facility]].&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|title=Earliest Known Winery Found in Armenian Cave|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/01/110111-oldest-wine-press-making-winery-armenia-science-ucla/|date=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the story of [[Hayk]], the legendary founder of Armenia, around 2107 BC Hayk foughy against [[Belus (Babylonian)|Belus]], the Babylonian God of War, at [[Çavuştepe]] along the Engil river to establish the very first Armenian state. Historically, this event coincides with the destruction of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] by the [[Gutian dynasty of Sumer]] in 2115 BC,&lt;ref&gt;De Mieroop, Marc Van. (2004).

Several [[Bronze Age]] states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia, including the [[Hittites]] (at the height of their power), [[Mitanni]] (southwestern historical Armenia), and [[Hayasa-Azzi]] (1500–1200&amp;nbsp;BC). The [[Nairi]] people (12th to 9th centuries BC) and [[Urartu]] (1000–600&amp;nbsp;BC) successively established their sovereignty over the [[Armenian Highlands]]. Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the [[Armenians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Vahan|last=Kurkjian|title=History of Armenia|location=Michigan|publisher=[[Armenian General Benevolent Union]]|year=1958|edition=1964|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/home.html|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia|page=v. 12|location=Yerevan|publisher=Armenian Encyclopedia|year=1987|title-link=Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Artak|last=Movsisyan|title=Sacred Highland: Armenia in the spiritual conception of the Near East|publisher=Yerevan|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martiros|last=Kavoukjian|title=The Genesis of Armenian People|publisher=Montreal|year=1982|authorlink=Martiros Kavoukjian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large cuneiform lapidary inscription found in [[Yerevan]] established that the modern capital of Armenia was founded in the summer of 782&amp;nbsp;BC by King [[Argishti I of Urartu|Argishti I]].

During the late 6th century BC, the [[Satrapy of Armenia|first geographical entity that was called Armenia]] by neighbouring populations was established under the [[Orontid Dynasty]] within the [[Achaemenid Empire]], as part of the latters' territories. The kingdom became fully sovereign from the sphere of influence of the [[Seleucid Empire]] in 190 BC under King [[Artaxias I]] and begun the rule of the [[Artaxiad dynasty]]. Armenia reached its height between 95 and 66&amp;nbsp;BC under [[Tigranes the Great]], becoming the most powerful kingdom of its time east of the [[Roman Republic]].

In the next centuries, Armenia was in the [[Persian Empire]]'s sphere of influence during the reign of [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates I]], the founder of the [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia]], which itself was a branch of the [[Parthian Empire]]. Throughout its history, the kingdom of Armenia enjoyed both periods of independence and periods of autonomy subject to contemporary empires. Its strategic location between two continents has subjected it to invasions by many peoples, including [[Assyria]] (under [[Ashurbanipal]], at around 669–627 BC, the boundaries of Assyria reached as far as Armenia and the [[Caucasus Mountains]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu.com/assyria/|title=Assyria|author=Joshua J.

Religion in ancient Armenia was historically related to a set of beliefs that, in Persia, led to the emergence of [[Zoroastrianism]]. It particularly focused on the worship of [[Mithra]] and also included a pantheon of gods such as [[Aramazd]], [[Vahagn]], [[Anahit]], and [[Astghik]]. The country used the solar [[Armenian calendar]], which consisted of 12 months.

Christianity spread into the country as early as AD 40. [[Tiridates III of Armenia]] (238–314) made Christianity the [[state religion]] in 301,&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] |title=The World Factbook: Armenia |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/am.html |accessdate=15 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114000914/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/am.html |archivedate=14 November 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="almanac"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brunner|first=Borgna|title=Time Almanac with Information Please 2007|page=685|isbn=978-1-933405-49-0 |year=2006 |publisher=Time Home Entertainment |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; partly, in defiance of the [[Sasanian Empire]], it seems,&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"&gt;Mary Boyce.

Prior to this, during the latter part of the Parthian period, Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian country.&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"/&gt;

After the fall of the Kingdom of Armenia in 428, most of Armenia was incorporated as a [[Sasanian Armenia|''marzpanate'' within the Sasanian Empire]]. Following the [[Battle of Avarayr]] in 451, Christian Armenians maintained their religion and Armenia gained autonomy.

After the [[Sasanian Armenia|Sasanian period]] (428–636), Armenia emerged as [[Arminiya]], an autonomous principality under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], reuniting Armenian lands previously taken by the [[Byzantine Empire]] as well. The principality was ruled by the Prince of Armenia, and recognised by the [[Caliphate|Caliph]] and the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]]. It was part of the administrative division/emirate ''[[Arminiya]]'' created by the Arabs, which also included parts of Georgia and [[Caucasian Albania]], and had its centre in the Armenian city, [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]. Arminiya lasted until 884, when it regained its independence from the weakened [[Abbasid Caliphate]] under [[Ashot I of Armenia]].

The reemergent Armenian kingdom was ruled by the [[Bagratuni dynasty]] and lasted until 1045. In time, several areas of the Bagratid Armenia separated as independent kingdoms and principalities such as the Kingdom of [[Vaspurakan]] ruled by the House of [[Artsruni]] in the south, Kingdom of [[Syunik Province|Syunik]] in the east, or [[Kingdom of Artsakh]] on the territory of modern [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], while still recognising the supremacy of the Bagratid kings.

[[File:Cilician Armenia-en.svg|thumb|The [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], 1198–1375]]

In 1045, the Byzantine Empire conquered Bagratid Armenia. Soon, the other Armenian states fell under Byzantine control as well. The Byzantine rule was short lived, as in 1071 the [[Seljuk Empire]] defeated the Byzantines and conquered Armenia at the [[Battle of Manzikert]], establishing the Seljuk Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Holt |first=Peter Malcolm |last2=Lambton |first2=Ann Katharine Swynford |last3=Lewis |first3=Bernard |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Cambridge History of Islam |year=1977 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=231–32 |url= |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; To escape death or servitude at the hands of those who had assassinated his relative, [[Gagik II of Armenia]], King of [[Ani]], an Armenian named [[Ruben I, Prince of Armenia]], went with some of his countrymen into the gorges of the [[Taurus Mountains]] and then into [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] of [[Cilicia]]. The Byzantine governor of the palace gave them shelter where the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] was eventually established on 6 January 1198 under [[Leo I, King of Armenia]], a descendant of Prince Ruben.

Cilicia was a strong ally of the [[Crusades|European Crusaders]], and saw itself as a bastion of Christendom in the East. Cilicia's significance in Armenian history and statehood is also attested by the transfer of the seat of the Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church, the spiritual leader of the Armenian people, to the region.

The Seljuk Empire soon started to collapse. In the early 12th century, Armenian princes of the Zakarid family drove out the Seljuk Turks and established a semi-independent principality in northern and eastern Armenia known as [[Zakarid Armenia]], which lasted under the patronage of the [[History of Georgia (country)|Georgian Kingdom]]. The [[Orbelian Dynasty]] shared control with the Zakarids in various parts of the country, especially in Syunik and [[Vayots Dzor Province|Vayots Dzor]], while the [[House of Hasan-Jalalyan]] controlled provinces of [[Artsakh (historic province)|Artsakh]] and [[Utik]] as the Kingdom of Artsakh.

=== Early Modern era ===
{{further|Iranian Armenia (1502–1828)|Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Russian Armenia}}
During the 1230s, the [[Mongol Empire]] conquered Zakarid Armenia and then the remainder of Armenia. The Mongolian invasions were soon followed by those of other Central Asian tribes, such as the [[Kara Koyunlu]], [[Timurid dynasty]] and [[Ağ Qoyunlu]], which continued from the 13th century until the 15th century. After incessant invasions, each bringing destruction to the country, with time Armenia became weakened.

In the 16th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Iran divided Armenia. From the early 16th century, both [[Western Armenia]] and [[Eastern Armenia]] fell to the Safavid Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rayfield|first=Donald|title=Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxQpmg_JIpwC&amp;pg=PA165|year=2013|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-78023-070-2|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Steven R.|title=Immortal, Updated Edition: A Military History of Iran and Its Armed Forces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOuVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|year=2014|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=978-1-62616-032-3|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the century long Turco-Iranian geopolitical rivalry that would last in Western Asia, significant parts of the region were frequently fought over between the two rivalling empires.

From 1604, [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I of Iran]] implemented a "[[scorched earth]]" policy in the region to protect his north-western frontier against any invading Ottoman forces, a policy that involved a [[History of Armenia#Persian Armenia|forced resettlement]] of masses of Armenians outside of their homelands.&lt;ref&gt;H.

While Western Armenia still remained under Ottoman rule, the Armenians were granted considerable autonomy within their own [[enclave]]s and lived in relative harmony with other groups in the empire (including the ruling Turks). However, as Christians under a strict Muslim [[social structure]], Armenians faced pervasive discrimination. When they began pushing for more rights within the Ottoman Empire, Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]], in response, organised state-sponsored massacres against the Armenians between 1894 and 1896, resulting in an estimated death toll of 80,000 to 300,000 people. The [[Hamidian massacres]], as they came to be known, gave Hamid international infamy as the "Red Sultan" or "Bloody Sultan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Minahan|first1=James|title=The complete guide to national symbols and emblems|date=2010|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-0-313-34497-8|page=310|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfrWCQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period is known as [[Russian Armenia]].

During the 1890s, the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], commonly known as ''Dashnaktsutyun'', became active within the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the aim of unifying the various small groups in the empire that were advocating for reform and defending Armenian villages from massacres that were widespread in some of the Armenian-populated areas of the empire. Dashnaktsutyun members also formed [[Armenian fedayi]] groups that defended Armenian civilians through armed resistance. The Dashnaks also worked for the wider goal of creating a "free, independent and unified" Armenia, although they sometimes set aside this goal in favour of a more realistic approach, such as advocating autonomy.

The Ottoman Empire began to collapse, and in 1908, the [[Young Turk Revolution]] overthrew the government of Sultan Hamid. In April 1909, the [[Adana massacre]] occurred in the [[Adana Vilayet]] of the Ottoman Empire resulting in the deaths of as many as 20,000–30,000 Armenians. The Armenians living in the empire hoped that the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] would change their second-class status. [[Armenian reform package]] (1914) was presented as a solution by appointing an [[inspector general]] over Armenian issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirakosian|first=J.

=== World War I and the Armenian Genocide ===
{{Main|Armenian Genocide}}
[[File:Morgenthau336.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian Genocide]] victims in 1915]]
The outbreak of World War I lead to confrontation between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus]] and [[Persian Campaign]]s. The new government in [[Istanbul]] began to look on the Armenians with distrust and suspicion, because the [[Imperial Russian Army]] contained a contingent of [[Armenian volunteer units|Armenian volunteers]]. On 24 April 1915, [[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915|Armenian intellectuals were arrested by Ottoman authorities]] and, with the [[Tehcir Law]] (29 May 1915), eventually a large proportion of Armenians living in [[Anatolia]] perished in what has become known as the [[Armenian Genocide]].

The genocide was implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirm on [[death march]]es leading to the [[Syrian desert]]. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Hans-Lukas|last1=Kieser|first2=Dominik J.|last2=Schaller|language=German|title=Der Völkermord an den Armeniern und die Shoah|trans-title=The Armenian genocide and the Shoah|publisher=Chronos|year=2002|isbn=978-3-0340-0561-6|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Armenia: The Survival of A Nation |first = Christopher J. |last = Walker |publisher = Croom Helm |place = London |year = 1980 |pages = 200–03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was local [[Armenian resistance during the Armenian Genocide|Armenian resistance]] in the region, developed against the activities of the Ottoman Empire. The events of 1915 to 1917 are regarded by Armenians and the vast majority of Western historians to have been state-sponsored mass killings, or genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/facts/gen_bib1.html|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011116212954/http://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/facts/gen_bib1.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 November 2001|title=Extensive bibliography by University of Michigan on the Armenian Genocide |publisher=Umd.umich.edu |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish authorities deny the genocide took place to this day.

Toynbee]], an estimated 600,000 Armenians died during deportation from 1915–16. This figure, however, accounts for solely the first year of the Genocide and does not take into account those who died or were killed after the report was compiled on 24 May 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Melson, ''Revolution and Genocide: On the Origins of the Armenian Genocide and the Holocaust'', University Of Chicago Press, 15 October 1992, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]] places the death toll at "more than a million".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6045182.stm Q&amp;A: Armenian genocide dispute].

Armenia and the Armenian diaspora have been campaigning for [[Recognition of the Armenian Genocide|official recognition]] of the events as genocide for over 30&amp;nbsp;years. These events are traditionally commemorated yearly on 24 April, the Armenian Martyr Day, or the Day of the Armenian Genocide.

[[File:Yerevan Hanrapetutyan street 02.jpg|thumb|The Government house of the [[First Republic of Armenia]] (1918–1920)]]

Although the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] of Imperial forces commanded by [[Nikolai Yudenich]] and Armenians in volunteer units and Armenian militia led by [[Andranik Ozanian]] and [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]] succeeded in gaining most of Ottoman Armenia during World War I, their gains were lost with the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution of 1917]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} At the time, Russian-controlled [[Eastern Armenia]], Georgia, and [[Azerbaijan]] attempted to bond together in the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]. This federation, however, lasted from only February to May 1918, when all three parties decided to dissolve it. As a result, the Dashnaktsutyun government of Eastern Armenia declared its independence on 28 May as the [[First Republic of Armenia]] under the leadership of [[Aram Manukian]].

The First Republic's short-lived independence was fraught with war, [[territorial dispute]]s, and a mass influx of refugees from Ottoman Armenia, bringing with them disease and starvation. The [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]], appalled by the actions of the Ottoman government, sought to help the newly founded Armenian state through relief funds and other forms of support.

At the end of the war, the victorious powers sought to divide up the Ottoman Empire. Signed between the [[Allies of World War I|Allied and Associated Powers]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] at [[Sèvres]] on 10 August 1920, the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] promised to maintain the existence of the Armenian republic and to attach the former territories of Ottoman Armenia to it. Because the new borders of Armenia were to be drawn by United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]], Ottoman Armenia was also referred to as "[[Wilsonian Armenia]]". In addition, just days prior, on 5 August 1920, [[Mihran Damadian]] of the Armenian National Union, the de facto Armenian administration in Cilicia, declared the independence of [[Cilicia]] as an Armenian autonomous republic under French protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian, Richard, and Simon Payaslian. Armenian Cilicia. Costa Mesa: Mazda Publishers, Inc., 2008. 483. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was even consideration of possibly making Armenia a mandate under the protection of the United States. The treaty, however, was rejected by the [[Turkish National Movement]], and never came into effect. The movement used the treaty as the occasion to declare itself the rightful [[Politics of Turkey|government of Turkey]], replacing the monarchy based in [[Istanbul]] with a republic based in [[Ankara]].

[[File:11thRedArmyYerevan.jpg|thumb|left|Advance of the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|11th Red Army]] into the city of Yerevan]]
In 1920, Turkish nationalist forces invaded the fledgling Armenian republic from the east. Turkish forces under the command of [[Kâzım Karabekir|Kazım Karabekir]] captured Armenian territories that Russia had annexed in the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War]] and occupied the old city of Alexandropol (present-day [[Gyumri]]). The violent conflict finally concluded with the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] on 2 December 1920. The treaty forced Armenia to disarm most of its [[Armed forces|military forces]], cede all former Ottoman territory granted to it by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], and to give up all the "Wilsonian Armenia" granted to it at the Sèvres treaty. Simultaneously, the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|Soviet Eleventh Army]], under the command of [[Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze]], invaded Armenia at Karavansarai (present-day [[Ijevan]]) on 29 November. By 4 December, Ordzhonikidze's forces entered Yerevan and the short-lived Armenian republic collapsed.

After the fall of the republic, the [[February Uprising]] soon took place in 1921, and led to the establishment of the [[Republic of Mountainous Armenia]] by Armenian forces under command of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] on 26 April, which fought off both Soviet and Turkish intrusions in the Zangezur region of southern Armenia. After Soviet agreements to include the [[Syunik Province]] in Armenia's borders, the rebellion ended and the Red Army took control of the region on 13 July.

=== Soviet Armenia ===
{{Main|Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic}}
[[File:Emblem of the Armenian SSR.svg|thumb|The coat of arms of [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]] depicting [[Mount Ararat]] in the centre]]

Armenia was annexed by [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]] and along with [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]], it was incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] (TSFSR) on 4 March 1922.&lt;ref name="main1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countriesquest.com/asia/azerbaijan/history/the_soviet_period.htm |title=The Soviet Period – History – Azerbaijan – Asia |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BSE"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150925080238/http://bse.chemport.ru/zakavkazskaya_federatsiya.shtml Закавказская федерация]. ''Большая советская энциклопедия'', 3-е изд., гл. ред. А. М. Прохоров. Москва: Советская энциклопедия, 1972. Т. 9 ({{cite book|section = Transcaucasian Federation |title = Great Soviet Encyclopedia |editor = A. M. Prokhorov|language = Russian |publisher = Soviet Encyclopedia |publication-place = Moscow |year = 1972 |volume = 9|display-editors=etal|title-link = Great Soviet Encyclopedia }})&lt;/ref&gt; With this annexation, the Treaty of Alexandropol was superseded by the Turkish-Soviet [[Treaty of Kars]]. In the agreement, Turkey allowed the Soviet Union to assume control over [[Adjara]] with the port city of [[Batumi]] in return for sovereignty over the cities of [[Kars]], [[Ardahan]], and [[Iğdır]], all of which were part of Russian Armenia.&lt;ref name="main1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BSE"/&gt;

The TSFSR existed from 1922 to 1936, when it was divided up into three separate entities ([[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]], [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]], and [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]]). Armenians enjoyed a period of relative stability under Soviet rule. They received medicine, food, and other provisions from Moscow, and communist rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The situation was difficult for the church, which struggled under Soviet rule. After the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]] took the reins of power and began an era of renewed fear and terror for Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald G. Suny, James Nichol, Darrell L. Slider. &lt;u&gt;Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia&lt;/u&gt;. Federal Research Division, [[Library of Congress]]. 1995. pp. 17 and following&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia was not the scene of any battles in World War II. An estimated 500,000 Armenians (nearly a third of the population) served in the military during the war, and 175,000 died.&lt;ref&gt;C. Mouradian, ''L'Armenie sovietique'', pp. 278–79&lt;/ref&gt;

Fears decreased when Stalin died in 1953 and [[Nikita Khrushchev|Nikita Khruschev]] emerged as the Soviet Union's new leader. Soon, life in Soviet Armenia began to see rapid improvement. The church, which suffered greatly under Stalin, was revived when [[Catholicos of All Armenians|Catholicos]] [[Vazgen I]] assumed the duties of his office in 1955. In 1967, a memorial to the victims of the Armenian Genocide was built at the [[Tsitsernakaberd]] hill above the [[Hrazdan]] [[Canyon|gorge]] in [[Yerevan]]. This occurred after [[1965 Yerevan demonstrations|mass demonstrations]] took place on the tragic event's fiftieth anniversary in 1965.

[[File:Karabakh movement demonstration at Yerevan Opera square (4).jpg|thumb|Armenians gather at [[Freedom Square, Yerevan|Theater Square]] in central [[Yerevan]] to claim unification of [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] with the [[Armenian SSR]].]]
During the [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] era of the 1980s, with the reforms of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]], Armenians began to demand better environmental care for their country, opposing the pollution that Soviet-built factories brought. Tensions also developed between Soviet Azerbaijan and its autonomous district of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], a majority-Armenian region. About 484,000 [[Armenians in Azerbaijan|Armenians]] lived in Azerbaijan in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Azerbaijan+Soviet+Socialist+Republic Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]". The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenians of Karabakh demanded unification with Soviet Armenia. Peaceful protests in Yerevan supporting the Karabakh Armenians were met with [[Sumgait pogrom|anti-Armenian pogroms]] in the Azerbaijani city of [[Sumgait]]. Compounding Armenia's problems was a [[1988 Armenian earthquake|devastating earthquake]] in 1988 with a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 7.2.&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia 2004. p. 74 by Imogen Gladman, [[Taylor and Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis]] Group&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorbachev's inability to alleviate any of Armenia's problems created disillusionment among the Armenians and fed a growing hunger for independence. In May 1990, the New [[Armenian Army]] (NAA) was established, serving as a defence force separate from the Soviet [[Red Army]]. Clashes soon broke out between the NAA and [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs|Soviet Internal Security Forces]] (MVD) troops based in Yerevan when Armenians decided to commemorate the establishment of the 1918 First Republic of Armenia. The violence resulted in the deaths of five Armenians killed in a shootout with the MVD at the railway station. Witnesses there claimed that the MVD used excessive force and that they had instigated the fighting.

Further firefights between Armenian militiamen and Soviet troops occurred in [[Nubarashen|Sovetashen]], near the capital and resulted in the deaths of over 26 people, mostly Armenians. The [[pogrom of Armenians in Baku]] in January 1990 forced almost all of the 200,000 Armenians in the Azerbaijani capital [[Baku]] to flee to Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/rights/articles/pp021603.shtml Notes from Baku: Black January]. Rufat Ahmedov. EurasiaNet Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August 1990, Armenia declared its sovereignty on its territory. On 17 March 1991, Armenia, along with the [[Baltic states]], Georgia and [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldova]], boycotted a nationwide [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|referendum]] in which 78% of all voters voted for the retention of the Soviet Union in a reformed form.&lt;ref name="NewsBrief"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soviethistory.org/index.php?action=L2&amp;SubjectID=1991march&amp;Year=1991 |title=The March Referendum |accessdate=10 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015092843/http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?action=L2&amp;SubjectID=1991march&amp;Year=1991 |archivedate=15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restoration of independence ===
{{Main|History of Armenia#Independent Armenia (1991-today)}}
[[File:NKR war.JPG|thumb|Armenian soldiers during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]]]

On 21 September 1991, Armenia officially declared its independence after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed August coup]] in Moscow. [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]] was popularly elected the first President of the newly independent Republic of Armenia on 16 October 1991. He had risen to prominence by leading the [[Karabakh movement]] for the unification of the Armenian-populated [[Nagorno-Karabakh]].&lt;ref name="Croissant"/&gt; On 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist and Armenia's independence was recognised.

Ter-Petrosyan led Armenia alongside Defense Minister [[Vazgen Sargsyan]] through the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] with neighbouring Azerbaijan. The initial post-Soviet years were marred by economic difficulties, which had their roots early in the Karabakh conflict when the [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party|Azerbaijani Popular Front]] managed to pressure the Azerbaijan SSR to instigate a railway and air [[blockade]] against Armenia. This move effectively crippled Armenia's economy as 85% of its cargo and goods arrived through rail traffic.&lt;ref name="Croissant"&gt;{{cite book

The Karabakh war ended after a Russian-brokered [[Ceasefire|cease-fire]] was put in place in 1994. The war was a success for the Karabakh Armenian forces who managed to capture 16% of Azerbaijan's internationally recognised territory including Nagorno-Karabakh itself.&lt;ref name="DeWaal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas|last=De Waal|title=Black Garden: Armenia And Azerbaijan Through Peace and War|location=New York|publisher=New York University Press|page=240|isbn=978-0-8147-1945-9 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Armenia and Azerbaijan have held peace talks, mediated by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). The status of Karabakh has yet to be determined. The economies of both countries have been hurt in the absence of a complete resolution and Armenia's borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan remain closed. By the time both Azerbaijan and Armenia had finally agreed to a ceasefire in 1994, an estimated 30,000 people had been killed and over a million had been displaced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/1283/conflict_that_can_be_resolved_in_time.html A Conflict That Can Be Resolved in Time: Nagorno-Karabakh].

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Armenia}}
Armenia is a [[landlocked country]] in the [[geopolitical]] [[Transcaucasus]] (South Caucasus) region, that is located in the Southern [[Caucasus Mountains]] and their lowlands between the [[Black Sea]] and [[Caspian Sea]], and northeast of the [[Armenian Highland]]s. Armenia is bordered on the north by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the east by [[Azerbaijan]]; the south by [[Iran]]; and the southwest and west by [[Turkey]]. Armenia lies between latitudes [[38th parallel north|38°]] and [[42nd parallel north|42° N]], and meridians [[43rd meridian east|43°]] and [[47th meridian east|47° E]].

=== Topography ===

The Republic of Armenia has a territorial area of {{convert|29743|km2|sqmi|0}}. The terrain is mostly mountainous, with fast flowing rivers, and few forests. The land rises to {{convert|4,090|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]] at [[Mount Aragats]], and no point is below {{convert|390|m|ft|0}} [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographic Characteristic of The Republic of Armenia|work=Marzes of the Republic of Armenia in Figures, 2002–2006|publisher=National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia|url=http://www.armstat.am/file/article/marz_07_e_2.pdf|year=2007|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of countries by average elevation|Average elevation of the country]] area is 10th highest in the world.

;Mount Ararat
[[Mount Ararat]], which was historically part of Armenia, is the highest mountain in the region.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Armenia}}

The climate in Armenia is markedly highland [[Continental climate|continental]]. Summers are dry and sunny, lasting from June to mid-September. The temperature fluctuates between {{convert|22|and|36|C|F}}. However, the low humidity level mitigates the effect of high temperatures. Evening breezes blowing down the mountains provide a welcome refreshing and cooling effect. Springs are short, while autumns are long. Autumns are known for their vibrant and colourful foliage.

Winters are quite cold with plenty of snow, with temperatures ranging between {{convert|-10|and|-5|°C|°F}}. [[Winter sport]]s enthusiasts enjoy skiing down the hills of [[Tsakhkadzor]], located thirty minutes outside Yerevan.

Armenia ranked 63rd out of 180 countries on [[Environmental Performance Index]] (EPI) in 2018. Its rank on subindex Environmental Health (which is weighted at 40% in EPI) is 109, while Armenia's rank on subindex of Ecosystem Vitality (weighted at 60% in EPI) is 27th best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://epi.envirocenter.yale.edu/epi-country-report/ARM|title=Environmental Performance Index|website=epi.envirocenter.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that main environmental issues in Armenia are with [[Armenia#Health|population health]], while environment vitality is of lesser concern. Out of sub-subindices contributing to Environmental Health subindex ranking on Air Quality to which population is exposed is particularly unsatisfying.

[[Waste management in Armenia]] is underdeveloped, as no waste sorting or recycling takes place at Armenia's 60 landfills. A waste processing plant is scheduled for construction near [[Hrazdan]] city, which will allow for closure of 10 waste dumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.am/en/news/item/9338/|title="We have good reasons to boast economic growth in the coming years" - Karen Karapetyan Pleased with 2017 Indices in Kotayk Marz|website=www.gov.am|language=en|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Government of Armenia|Politics of Armenia}}

[[File:Parliament Yerevan building.jpg|thumb|The [[National Assembly (Armenia)|National Assembly]] in [[Yerevan]]]]

[[Politics of Armenia]] takes place in a framework of  [[Representative democracy|representative]]  [[Parliamentary democracy|parliamentary democratic]] republic. Until transition in April 2018 Armenian constitution adhered to the model of [[Semi-Presidential Republic|semi-presidential republic]].

According to the current [[Constitution of Armenia]], the [[President of Armenia|President]] is the [[head of state]] holding largely representational functions, while the [[Prime Minister of Armenia|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]] and exercises [[Executive (government)|executive power]].

[[Legislature|Legislative power]] is vested in the [[unicameral parliament]] is also called the [[National Assembly of Armenia|Azgayin Zhoghov]] or ''[[National Assembly of Armenia|National Assembly]].''

Armenia has universal suffrage above the age of eighteen.

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Armenia|Armenia and the European Union|Armenia–Turkey relations}}
[[File:Moscow, embassy of Armenia (2).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Embassy of Armenia in Moscow]]]]

Armenia presently maintains positive relations with almost every country in the world, with two major exceptions being its immediate neighbours, Turkey and Azerbaijan. Tensions were running high between Armenians and Azerbaijanis during the final years of the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] dominated the region's politics throughout the 1990s.&lt;ref name="CFR-9148"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagorno-Karabakh: The Crisis in the Caucasus |url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/9148/ |accessdate=6 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, Armenia's borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan are under severe blockade. In addition, a permanent solution for the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has not been reached despite the mediation provided by organizations such as the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]].

Armenia is a member of more than 40 international organisations, including the United Nations; the [[Council of Europe]]; the [[Asian Development Bank]]; the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]; the [[World Trade Organization]]; [[World Customs Organization]]; the [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation]]; and [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]]. It is a member of the [[Collective Security Treaty Organisation|CSTO]] military alliance, and also participates in NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] program.

Turkey also has a long history of poor relations with Armenia over its refusal to acknowledge the [[Armenian Genocide]], even though it was one of the first countries to recognize the Republic of Armenia (the 3rd republic) after its independence from the USSR in 1991. Despite this, for most of the 20th century and early 21st century, relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries due to Turkey's refusal to establish them for numerous reasons. During the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and citing it as the reason, Turkey illegally closed its border with Armenia in 1993. It has not lifted its blockade despite pressure from the powerful Turkish business lobby interested in Armenian markets.&lt;ref name="CFR-9148"/&gt;

On 10 October 2009, Armenia and Turkey signed protocols on the normalisation of relations, which set a timetable for restoring diplomatic ties and reopening their joint border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20091010/ts_nm/us_turkey_armenia_9 |title=Armenia and Turkey sign peace deal |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014080048/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20091010/ts_nm/us_turkey_armenia_9 |archivedate=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratification of those had to be made in the national parliaments. In Armenia, it passed through the legislatively required approval of the Constitutional Court and was sent to parliament for final ratification. The President had made multiple public announcements, both in Armenia and abroad, that, as the leader of the political majority of Armenia, he assured the ratification of the protocols if Turkey also ratified them. Despite this, the process stopped, as Turkey continuously added more preconditions to its ratification and also "delayed it beyond any reasonable time-period".

Due to its position between two unfriendly neighbours, Armenia has close security ties with Russia. At the request of the Armenian government, Russia maintains a [[Russian 102nd Military Base|military base]] in the city of [[Gyumri]] located in Northwestern Armenia.&lt;ref name="Armenia-base"&gt;{{cite news

It maintains good relations with the United States especially through its [[Armenian diaspora]].

By all accounts, over half of the Armenians in the United States live in California.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the illicit border blockades by Azerbaijan and Turkey, Armenia continues to maintain solid relations with its southern neighbour Iran especially in the economic sector. Economic projects such a gas pipeline going from Iran to Armenia are being developed.

Armenia is also a member of the Council of Europe, maintaining friendly relations with the European Union, especially with its member states such as France and Greece. A 2005 survey reported that 64% of Armenia's population would be in favour of joining the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armeniaforeignministry.am/news/inthenews/050107_eu.html |title=RFE/RL Caucasus Report |publisher=Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=7 January 2005 |accessdate=22 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120111039/http://armeniaforeignministry.am/news/inthenews/050107_eu.html |archivedate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Armenian officials have also expressed the desire for their country to eventually become an EU member state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arminfo.am/political-issue22.html |title=Interview with RA National Assembly Speaker Artur Baghdasaryan |publisher=ArmInfo News Agency |date=26 October 2005 |accessdate=22 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113164842/http://www.arminfo.am/political-issue22.html |archivedate=13 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; some{{who|date=January 2016}} predicting that it will make an official bid for membership in a few years.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In 2004 its forces joined [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], a NATO-led international force in [[Kosovo]].

=== Human rights and freedom ===
{{Main|Human rights in Armenia}}
Human rights in Armenia tend to be better than those in most [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet republics]] and have drawn closer to acceptable standards, especially economically.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Still, there are several considerable problems.

Armenia is classified "partly free" in 2018 report (with data for 2017) by [[Freedom House]], which gives it a score of 45 out of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/armenia|title=Armenia|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia is ranks 54th in 2017 report of Human Freedom Index (with data for 2016) published by Canada's [[Fraser Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/human-freedom-index-2017|title=The Human Freedom Index 2017|date=2018-01-25|work=Fraser Institute|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia ranked 29th for economic freedom and 76th for personal freedom among 159 countries in 2017 [[List of freedom indices|Human Freedom Index]] published by the [[Cato Institute]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/2017-human-freedom-index-country-profiles.pdf|title=COUNTRY PROFILES|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index|title=Human Freedom Index|work=Cato Institute|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Armenianarmya.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian Army]] [[BTR-80]]s]]
[[File:2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade-8.jpeg|thumb|Armenian soldiers at the [[2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade]]]]

The [[Armenian Army]], [[Armenian Air Force|Air Force]], [[Armenian Air Force|Air Defence]], and [[Armenian Border Guard|Border Guard]] comprise the four branches of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Armenia. The Armenian military was formed after the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–91)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 and with the establishment of the Ministry of Defence in 1992.

The [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] of the military is the [[Prime Minister of Armenia]], [[Nikol Pashinyan]]. The Ministry of Defence is in charge of political leadership, headed by [[David Tonoyan|Davit Tonoyan]], while military command remains in the hands of the general staff, headed by the [[Chief of the General Staff (Armenia)|Chief of Staff]], who is Major-General [[Artak Davtyan]].

Active forces now number about 81,000 soldiers, with an additional [[Military reserve force|reserve]] of 32,000 troops. Armenian border guards are in charge of patrolling the country's borders with [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], while Russian troops continue to monitor its borders with [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]. In the case of an attack, Armenia is able to mobilise every able-bodied man between the age of 15 and 59, with military preparedness.

The [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]], which establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of military equipment, was ratified by the Armenian parliament in July 1992. In March 1993, Armenia signed the multilateral [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], which calls for the eventual elimination of chemical weapons. Armenia acceded to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) as a non-nuclear weapons state in July 1993.

Armenia is member of [[Collective Security Treaty Organisation]] (CSTO) along with [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Russia]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. It participates in NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] (PiP) program and is in a NATO organisation called [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC). Armenia has engaged in a peacekeeping mission in [[Kosovo]] as part of non-NATO [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] troops under Greek command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=KFOR Contingent: Armenia |url=http://www.nato.int/kfor/structur/nations/armenia.htm |publisher=Official Web Site of the Kosovo Force |date=23 March 2007 |accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia also had 46 members of its military [[peacekeeping]] forces as a part of the [[International Security Assistance Force|Coalition Forces]] in [[Iraq War]] until October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Last shift of Armenian peacekeepers in Iraq returns home |url=http://www.mil.am/eng/index.php?page=2&amp;p=0&amp;id=633&amp;y=2008&amp;m=10&amp;d=29 |publisher=Ministry of Defence |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=29 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515101803/http://www.mil.am/eng/index.php?page=2&amp;p=0&amp;id=633&amp;y=2008&amp;m=10&amp;d=29 |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Armenia}}
{{Armenia Labelled Map|float=right}}
[[File:Գեղարդ.jpg|thumb|[[Geghard]] monastery, [[Kotayk Province]]]]
Armenia is divided into ten [[Administrative divisions of Armenia|provinces]] (''marzer'', singular ''marz''), with the city (''kaghak'') of [[Yerevan]] ({{lang|hy|Երևան}}) having special administrative status as the country's capital. The chief executive in each of the ten provinces is the ''marzpet'' (''marz'' governor), appointed by the government of Armenia. In Yerevan, the chief executive is the mayor, appointed by the president.

Within each province are [[List of municipalities of Armenia|communities]] (''hamaynkner'', singular ''hamaynk''). Each community is self-governing and consists of one or more settlements (''bnakavayrer'', singular ''bnakavayr''). Settlements are classified as either towns (''kaghakner'', singular ''kaghak'') or villages (''gyugher'', singular ''gyugh''). {{As of|2007}}, Armenia includes 915 communities, of which 49 are considered urban and 866 are considered rural. The capital, Yerevan, also has the status of a community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regional Administration Bodies |url=http://www.gov.am/en/regions/ |publisher=The Government of the Republic of Armenia |accessdate=11 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Yerevan is divided into twelve semi-autonomous districts.

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Armenia}}

The economy relies heavily on investment and support from Armenians abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/19/AR2007101901471.html |title=Armenian Eyes, Ears on US Genocide Vote |work=The Washington Post |date=19 October 2007|accessdate=7 July 2009 |first=Avet |last=Demourian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before independence, Armenia's economy was largely industry-based – [[chemical substance|chemicals]], [[electronics]], machinery, [[food processing|processed food]], [[synthetic rubber]], and textile – and highly dependent on outside resources. The republic had developed a modern [[Secondary sector of the economy|industrial sector]], supplying [[machine tool]]s, textiles, and other [[Final goods|manufactured goods]] to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; Recently, the [[Intel Corporation]] agreed to open a research centre in Armenia, in addition to other technology companies, signalling the growth of the technology industry in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panarmenian.net/eng/it_telecom/details/51098/ |title=Intel center to open in Armenia |publisher=[[PanARMENIAN.Net]] |date=20 January 1990 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture accounted for less than 20% of both [[net material product]] and [[Full employment|total employment]] before the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. After independence, the importance of agriculture in the economy increased markedly, its share at the end of the 1990s rising to more than 30% of GDP and more than 40% of total employment.&lt;ref name=agri&gt;Z. Lerman and A. Mirzakhanian, ''Private Agriculture in Armenia'', Lexington Books, Lanham, MD, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This increase in the importance of agriculture was attributable to food security needs of the population in the face of uncertainty during the first phases of [[transition economy|transition]] and the collapse of the non-agricultural sectors of the economy in the early 1990s. As the economic situation stabilised and growth resumed, the share of agriculture in GDP dropped to slightly over 20% (2006 data), although the share of agriculture in employment remained more than 40%.&lt;ref name=yb2007&gt;[http://www.armstat.am/en/?nid=179 Statistical Yearbook 2007], Armenia National Statistical Service, Yerevan&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mount Ararat and the Yerevan skyline.jpg|thumb|[[Yerevan]] is the economic and cultural centre of Armenia.]]
Armenian mines produce copper, zinc, gold, and lead. The vast majority of energy is produced with fuel imported from Russia, including gas and nuclear fuel (for its one nuclear power plant); the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric. Small deposits of coal, gas, and petroleum exist but have not yet been developed.

Like other [[Post-Soviet states|newly independent states]] of the former Soviet Union, Armenia's economy suffers from the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns. Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the [[1988 Armenian earthquake|1988 Spitak earthquake]], which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. The conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved. The closure of Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because Armenia depends on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Georgia and Iran are inadequate or unreliable. The GDP fell nearly 60% between 1989 and 1993, but then resumed robust growth.&lt;ref name=agri/&gt; The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first years after its introduction in 1993.

Nevertheless, the government was able to make wide-ranging economic reforms that paid off in dramatically lower inflation and steady growth. The 1994 cease-fire in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has also helped the economy. Armenia has had strong economic growth since 1995, building on the turnaround that began the previous year, and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors, such as precious-stone processing and jewelry making, information and communication technology, and even tourism are beginning to supplement more traditional sectors of the economy, such as agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/armenia-becoming-world-class-hiking-destination-180965096/|title=How Armenia Plans to Become the Next World-Class Hiking Destination|first=Laura|last=Kiniry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Overdone house in Yerevan.jpg|thumb|New buildings in the [[Ajapnyak District]] of Yerevan]]
This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD), and other [[Global financial system|international financial institutions]] (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Loans to Armenia since 1993 exceed $1.1&amp;nbsp;billion. These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit and stabilising the currency; developing private businesses; energy; agriculture; food processing; transportation; the health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation in the earthquake zone. The government joined the World Trade Organization on 5 February 2003. But one of the main sources of foreign direct investments remains the Armenian diaspora, which finances major parts of the reconstruction of infrastructure and other public projects. Being a growing democratic state, Armenia also hopes to get more financial aid from the Western World.

A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a law on privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program of state property privatization. Continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improving the investment climate, and making strides against corruption. However, unemployment, which was 18.5% in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armstat.am/en/?nid=126&amp;id=08010|title=Unemployment Armenia |publisher=Armenian Statistical Service of Republic of Armenia |date= |accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; still remains a major problem due to the influx of thousands of refugees from the Karabakh conflict.

Armenia ranks 47th on [[Ease of doing business index|Doing Business]] Index in 2018 with 13th rank on "starting business" sub-index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/armenia|title=Doing Business in Armenia - World Bank Group|website=www.doingbusiness.org|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia ranked 83rd on the 2018 [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] [[Human Development Index|Human Development Index (with 2017 data)]] and is classified into "high human development" group.

In the 2015 [[Transparency International]] [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (CPI), Armenia ranked 95 of 168 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015/results |title=CPI 2015 table |publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 [[Index of Economic Freedom]], Armenia ranked 54th, ahead of countries like France, Portugal and Italy.&lt;ref name="economic-index" /&gt;

{{Main|Science and technology in Armenia}}
Research spending is low in Armenia, averaging 0.25% of GDP over 2010–2013. However, the statistical record of research expenditure is incomplete, as expenditure by privately owned business enterprises is not surveyed in Armenia. The world average for domestic expenditure on research was 1.7% of GDP in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Countries in the Black Sea basin.

The country's ''Strategy for the Development of Science 2011–2020'' envisions that ‘by 2020, Armenia is a country with a knowledge-based economy and is competitive within the European Research Area with its level of basic and applied research.’ It fixes the following targets:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Creation of a system capable of sustaining the development of science and technology;
* Development of scientific potential, modernization of scientific infrastructure;
* Promotion of basic and applied research;
* Creation of a synergistic system of education, science and innovation; and
* Becoming a prime location for scientific specialization in the European Research Area.
Based on this strategy, the accompanying ''Action Plan'' was approved by the government in June 2011. It defines the following targets:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Improve the management system for science and technology and create the requisite conditions for sustainable development;
* Involve more young, talented people in education and research, while upgrading research infrastructure;
* Create the requisite conditions for the development of an integrated national innovation system; and
* Enhance international co-operation in research and development.

Although the ''Strategy'' clearly pursues a ‘science push’ approach, with public research institutes serving as the key policy target, it nevertheless mentions the goal of establishing an innovation system. However, the main driver of innovation, the business sector, is not mentioned. In between publishing the ''Strategy'' and ''Action Plan'', the government issued a resolution in May 2010 on ''Science and Technology Development Priorities for 2010–2014''. These priorities are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Armenian studies, humanities and social sciences;
* Life sciences;
* Renewable energy, new energy sources;
* Advanced technologies, information technologies;
* Space, Earth sciences, sustainable use of natural resources; and
* Basic research promoting essential applied research.
The Law on the National Academy of Sciences was adopted in May 2011. This law is expected to play a key role in shaping the Armenian innovation system. It allows the National Academy of Sciences to extend its business activities to the commercialization of research results and the creation of spin-offs; it also makes provision for restructuring the National Academy of Sciences by combining institutes involved in closely related research areas into a single body. Three of these new centres are particularly relevant: the Centre for Biotechnology, the Centre for Zoology and Hydro-ecology and the Centre for Organic and Pharmaceutical Chemistry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The government is focusing its support on selected industrial sectors. More than 20 projects have been cofunded by the State Committee of Science in targeted branches: pharmaceuticals, medicine and biotechnology, agricultural mechanization and machine building, electronics, engineering, chemistry and, in particular, the sphere of information technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Over the past decade, the government has made an effort to encourage science–industry linkages. The Armenian information technology sector has been particularly active: a number of public–private partnerships have been established between companies and universities, in order to give students marketable skills and generate innovative ideas at the interface of science and business. Examples are Synopsys Inc. and the Enterprise Incubator Foundation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|In the communist era]], Armenian education followed the standard Soviet model of complete state control (from Moscow) of [[curriculum|curricula]] and teaching methods and close integration of education activities with other aspects of society, such as politics, culture, and the economy.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt;

In the 1988–89 school year, 301 students per 10,000 population were in specialized secondary or higher education, a figure slightly lower than the Soviet average.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt; In 1989 some 58% of Armenians over age fifteen had completed their secondary education, and 14% had a higher education.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt; In the 1990–91 school year, the estimated 1,307 primary and secondary schools were attended by 608,800 students.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt; Another seventy specialised secondary institutions had 45,900 students, and 68,400 students were enrolled in a total of ten postsecondary institutions that included universities.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt; In addition, 35% of eligible children attended [[preschool education|preschools]].&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt; In 1992 Armenia's largest institution of higher learning, [[Yerevan State University]], had eighteen departments, including ones for social sciences, sciences, and law.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt; Its faculty numbered about 1,300 teachers and its student population about 10,000 students.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt; The [[National Polytechnic University of Armenia]] is operating since 1933.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt;

In the early 1990s, Armenia made substantial changes to the centralised and regimented Soviet system.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; Because at least 98% of students in higher education were Armenian, curricula began to emphasise [[History of Armenia|Armenian history]] and culture.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; [[Armenian language|Armenian]] became the dominant language of instruction, and many schools that had taught in Russian closed by the end of 1991.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; Russian was still widely taught, however, as a second language.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

In 2014, the National Program for Educational Excellence embarked on creating an internationally competitive and academically rigorous alternative educational program (the Araratian Baccalaureate) for Armenian schools and increase the importance and status of the teacher's role in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://araratbaccalaureate.am/en/about-us|title=About us|website=araratbaccalaureate.am}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foundation.ayb.am/frontend/images/ck/files/Armenia%20Araratian%20Baccalaureate%20Briefing.pdf|title=The Araratian Baccalaureate: A guide for universities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regulation ====
The Ministry of Education and Science is responsible for regulation of the sector.

Primary and secondary education in Armenia is free, and completion of secondary school is compulsory.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt;

High education in Armenia is harmonized with [[Bologna Process|Bologna process]].

[[Armenian National Academy of Sciences]] plays important role in postgraduate education.

==== Secondary education ====
Schooling takes 12 years in Armenia and breaks down into primary (4 years), middle (5 years) and high school (3 years). Schools engage a 10-grade mark system.

Interesting feature of primary and secondary education is obligatory [[Chess in Armenia#Teaching of chess in schools|schooling in chess playing]].

[[UWC Dilijan]], [[Ayb School]] and [[QSI International School of Yerevan]] are private primary and secondary schools.

[[Tumo Center for Creative Technologies]] is one of the most prominent auxiliary education concepts in Armenia.

Armath&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://armath.am/|title=Armath|work=Armath|access-date=2018-02-25|language=am-AM}}&lt;/ref&gt; laboratories are a prominent concept for engaging pupils into studying technical sciences and applied technologies.

[[Teach For Armenia|Teach for Armenia]] is works towards the improvement of primary and secondary education enrollment in regions of Armenia.

The Government also supports [[List of Armenian schools#Schools outside Armenia|Armenian schools outside of Armenia]].

==== Tertiary education ====

* [[Fondation Université Française en Arménie]]
[[List of universities in Armenia]] includes many other.

===== American University of Armenia =====
The [[American University of Armenia]] has [[graduate school|graduate programs]] in Business and Law, among others. The institution owes its existence to the combined efforts of the Government of Armenia, the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]], [[United States Agency for International Development|US Agency for International Development]], and the [[University of California]]. The extension programs and the library at AUA form a new focal point for English-language intellectual life in the city. Armenia also hosts a deployment of [[One Laptop per Child]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://one.laptop.org/stories/nagorno-karabakh-and-armenia|title=Nagorno Karabakh and Armenia|publisher=[[One Laptop per Child]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Yerevan State Medical University =====
On the basis of the expansion and development of [[Yerevan State University]] a number of higher educational independent Institutions were formed including Medical Institute separated in 1930 which was set up on the basis of medical faculty. In 1980 [[Yerevan State Medical University]] was awarded one of the main rewards of the former USSR – the Order of Labor red Banner for training qualified specialists in health care and valuable service in the development of Medical Science. In 1995 YSMI was renamed to YSMU and since 1989 it has been named after [[Mkhitar Heratsi]], the famous medieval doctor. [[Mkhitar Heratsi]] was the founder of Armenian Medical school in Cilician Armenia. The great doctor played the same role in Armenian Medical Science as [[Hippocrates]] in Western, [[Galen]] in Roman, [[Avicenna|Ibn Sīnā]] in Arabic medicine.
[[File:ATC MAB Graduates.JPG|thumb|left|Graduates of the MAB program of the [[Armenian National Agrarian University|Agribusiness Teaching Center]].]]

Foreign students' department for Armenian diaspora established in 1957 later was enlarged and the enrollment of foreign students began. Nowadays the [[Yerevan State Medical University|YSMU]] is a Medical Institution corresponding to international requirements, trains medical staff for not only Armenia and neighbour countries, i.e. Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Georgia, but also many other leading countries all over the world. A great number of foreign students from India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the USA and Russia study together with Armenian students. Nowadays the university is ranked among famous higher Medical Institutions and takes its honourable place in the World Directory of Medical Schools published by the WHO.

===== Statistics =====
Gross enrollment in [[tertiary education]] at 44% in 2015 surpassed peer countries of South Caucasus but remained below of the average for Europe and Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=school_enrollment&amp;fdim_y=education_level:4&amp;fdim_y=gross_net:1&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=region:ECS&amp;idim=country:ARM:GEO:AZE&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=888264000000&amp;tend=1424721600000&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false|title=Chart - World Development Indicators (Google Public Data Explorer)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ArmenianDiaspora.png|thumb|The [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian population around the world]]]]
Armenia has [[Armenian diaspora|a relatively large external diaspora]] (8&amp;nbsp;million by some estimates, greatly exceeding the 3&amp;nbsp;million population of Armenia itself), with communities existing across the globe. The largest Armenian communities outside of Armenia can be found in [[Russia]], [[France]], [[Iran]], the [[United States]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]],
[[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[Israel]], [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Brazil]]. 40,000 to 70,000 Armenians still live in [[Turkey]] (mostly in and around [[Istanbul]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Ethnic [[Armenians]] make up 98.1% of the population. [[Yazidi]]s make up 1.2%, and [[Russians]] 0.4%.

During the [[Soviet era]], [[Azerbaijanis]] were historically the second largest population in the country (forming about 2.5% in 1989).&lt;ref name="1989census"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php?reg=13 The All-Union Population Census of 1989] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104081804/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php?reg=13 |date=4 January 2012 }}. ''Demoscope.ru''&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the conflict over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], virtually all of them emigrated from Armenia to Azerbaijan. Conversely, Armenia received a large influx of Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan, thus giving Armenia a more homogeneous character.

According to Gallup research conducted in 2017 Armenia has one of the highest migrant acceptance (welcoming) rates in eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/216377/new-index-shows-least-accepting-countries-migrants.aspx?g_source=link_newsv9&amp;g_campaign=item_224375&amp;g_medium=copy|title=New Index Shows Least-, Most-Accepting Countries for Migrants|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-01-19|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Armenia}}
[[Armenian language|Armenian]] is the only official language. The main foreign languages that Armenians know are Russian and English. Due to its Soviet past, most of the old population can speak Russian quite well. According to a 2013 survey, 95% of Armenians said they had some knowledge of Russian (24% advanced, 59% intermediate) compared to 40% who said they knew some English (4% advanced, 16% intermediate and 20% beginner). However, more adults (50%) think that English should be taught in public secondary schools than those who prefer Russian (44%).&lt;ref name="2012 knowledge"&gt;{{cite web|title=The South Caucasus Between The EU And The Eurasian Union|url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/CAD-51-52.pdf|work=Caucasus Analytical Digest #51–52|publisher=Forschungsstelle Osteuropa, Bremen and Center for Security Studies, Zürich|accessdate=3 July 2013|pages=22–23|date=17 June 2013|issn=1867-9323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant [[religion in Armenia]] is Christianity. The roots of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]] go back to the 1st century. According to tradition, the Armenian Church was founded by two of Jesus' twelve [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] – [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddaeus]] and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]] – who preached Christianity in Armenia between AD 40–60. Because of these two founding apostles, the official name of the Armenian Church is [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].

Over 93% of Armenian Christians belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church, a form of Oriental (Non-[[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]]) Orthodoxy, which is a very ritualistic, conservative church, roughly comparable to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/?id=5211|title=The Armenian Apostolic Church (World Council of Churches)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenian Apostolic Church is in communion only with a group of churches within [[Oriental Orthodoxy#Oriental Orthodox Communion|Oriental Orthodoxy]].

The [[Armenian Evangelical Church]] has a very sizeable and favourable presence among the life of Armenians with over several thousand members throughout the country. It traces its roots back to 1846 which was under patronage of the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]] the aim of which was to train qualified clergy for the Armenian Apostolic Church.

Other Christian denominations practising faith based on Nicene Creed in Armenia are the Pentecostal branches of Protestant community such as the Word of Life, the [[Armenian Brotherhood Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcy.org/ |title=Armenian Brotherhood Church of Yerevan}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Baptists]] which are known as of the oldest existing denominations in Armenia and were permitted by the authorities of Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://armbaplife.am/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825192643/http://www.armbaplife.am/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 August 2007 |title=Armenian Evangelical Christian Baptist |publisher=Armbaplife.am |date= |accessdate=28 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodnewsadvertising.com/biblical_recorder.pdf |title=Despite poverty, Baptists prosper in Armenia |work=[[Biblical Recorder]] |publisher=Baptist State convention of North Carolina |date=17 July 2004 |accessdate=28 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119232701/http://www.goodnewsadvertising.com/biblical_recorder.pdf |archivedate=19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Presbyterians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://highbeam.com/doc/1P1-79125406.html |title=Armenian Presbyterian Church to Commemorate 1700th Anniversary of Christianity in Armenia with Concert and Khachkar Dedication |work=[[The Armenian Reporter]] |date=20 October 2001 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510012451/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-79125406.html |archivedate=10 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholics also exist in Armenia, both [[Latin Church|Latin rite]] and [[Armenian rite]] Catholics. The [[Mechitarists]] (also spelled "Mekhitarists" {{lang-hy|Մխիթարեան}}), are a congregation of [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monks of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] founded in 1712 by [[Mekhitar of Sebaste]]. They are best known for their series of scholarly publications of ancient [[Armenians|Armenian]] versions of otherwise lost ancient Greek texts.

The [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] denomination is headquartered in [[Bzoummar]], [[Lebanon]].

Armenia is home to a [[Russians in Armenia|Russian]] community of [[Molokan]]s which practice a form of Spiritual Christianity originated from the Russian Orthodox Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lane|first1=Christel|title=Christian religion in the Soviet Union : a sociological study|date=1978|publisher=State univ. of New York P.|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-87395-327-6|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSmdHtacha8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yazidis, who live in the western part of the country, practice [[Yazidism]]. {{As of|2016}}, the world's largest Yazidi temple is under construction in the small village of Aknalish.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; There are also Kurds who practice [[Sunni Islam]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

There is a [[History of the Jews in Armenia|Jewish community in Armenia]] diminished to 750 persons since independence with most emigrants leaving for Israel. There are currently two synagogues in Armenia – in the capital, Yerevan, and in the city of [[Sevan (city)|Sevan]] located near [[Lake Sevan]].

Armenian music is a mix of indigenous folk music, perhaps best-represented by [[Djivan Gasparyan]]'s well-known [[duduk]] music, as well as light pop, and extensive [[Christian music]].

Instruments like the duduk, [[dhol]], [[zurna]], and [[Kanun (instrument)|kanun]] are commonly found in Armenian folk music. Artists such as [[Sayat Nova]] are famous due to their influence in the development of Armenian folk music. One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the [[Armenian chant]] which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia. Many of these chants are ancient in origin, extending to pre-Christian times, while others are relatively modern, including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet. Whilst under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule, the Armenian classical music composer [[Aram Khatchaturian]] became internationally well known for his music, for various ballets and the [[Sabre Dance]] from his composition for the ballet [[Gayane (ballet)|Gayane]].

The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world. Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music. In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called "kef" style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of [[Western Armenia]], and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated.

[[Richard Hagopian]] is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional "kef" style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 1940s and 1950s for developing their own style of "kef music" heavily influenced by the popular American [[Big Band]] Jazz of the time. Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European (especially French) pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 1960s and 1970s with artists such as [[Adiss Harmandian]] and [[Harout Pamboukjian]] performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia; also with artists such as [[Sirusho]], performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry.

Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned [[List of French-Armenians|French-Armenian]] singer and composer [[Charles Aznavour]], pianist [[Sahan Arzruni]], prominent opera sopranos such as [[Hasmik Papian]] and more recently [[Isabel Bayrakdarian]] and [[Anna Kasyan]]. Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band [[System of a Down]] (which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs) or pop star [[Cher]]. In the Armenian diaspora, [[Armenian Revolutionary Songs|Armenian revolutionary songs]] are popular with the youth. These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes.

[[Yerevan Vernissage]] (arts and crafts market), close to Republic Square, bustles with hundreds of vendors selling a variety of crafts on weekends and Wednesdays (though the selection is much reduced mid-week). The market offers woodcarving, antiques, fine lace, and the hand-knotted wool carpets and kilims that are a Caucasus speciality. [[Obsidian]], which is found locally, is crafted into assortment of jewellery and ornamental objects. Armenian gold smithery enjoys a long tradition, populating one corner of the market with a selection of gold items. Soviet relics and souvenirs of recent Russian manufacture – nesting dolls, watches, enamel boxes and so on – are also available at the Vernisage.

Across from the Opera House, a popular art market fills another city park on the weekends. Armenia’s long history as a crossroads of the [[ancient history|ancient world]] has resulted in a landscape with innumerable fascinating [[archaeological site]]s to explore. [[Middle Ages|Medieval]], [[Iron Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and even [[Stone Age]] sites are all within a few hours drive from the city. All but the most spectacular remain virtually undiscovered, allowing visitors to view churches and fortresses in their original settings.

The National Art Gallery in Yerevan has more than 16,000 works that date back to the [[Middle Ages]], which indicate Armenia's rich tales and stories of the times. It houses paintings by many [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] masters as well. The Modern Art Museum, the Children’s Picture Gallery, and the [[Martiros Saryan]] Museum are only a few of the other noteworthy collections of fine art on display in Yerevan. Moreover, many private galleries are in operation, with many more opening every year, featuring rotating exhibitions and sales.

On 13 April 2013, the Armenian government announced a change in law to allow [[freedom of panorama]] for 3D works of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.am/legislation.php?sel=show&amp;ID=4717 |title=Legislation: National Assembly of RA |publisher=Parliament.am |date= |accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Armenia}}
Cinema in Armenia was born on April 16, 1923, when the Armenian State Committee of Cinema was established by a decree of the Soviet Armenian government.

However, the first Armenian film with Armenian subject called "Haykakan Sinema" was produced earlier in 1912 in [[Cairo]] by Armenian-Egyptian publisher Vahan Zartarian. The film was premiered in Cairo on March 13, 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Armenian Cinema 100, by [[Artsvi Bakhchinyan]], Yerevan, 2012, pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1924, the first Armenian film studio; ''[[Armenfilm]]'' ({{lang-hy|Հայֆիլմ}} "Hayfilm," {{lang-ru|Арменкино}} "Armenkino") was established in Yerevan, starting with a [[documentary film]] called ''Soviet Armenia''.

''[[Namus (film)|Namus]]'' was the first Armenian [[silent film|silent]] [[black-and-white]] film, directed by [[Hamo Beknazarian]] in 1925, based on a play of [[Alexander Shirvanzade]], describing the ill fate of two lovers, who were engaged by their families to each other since childhood, but because of violations of ''[[namus]]'' (a tradition of honor), the girl was married by her father to another person. The first [[sound film]], ''[[Pepo (film)|Pepo]]'' was shot in 1935, director [[Hamo Beknazarian]].

[[File:Tsaghkadzor Olympic Sports complex.jpg|thumb|The Tsaghkadzor Olympic Sports complex]]
[[File:Ireland Armenia teams.jpg|thumb|The [[Armenia national football team]] in Dublin, Ireland]]

A wide array of sports are played in Armenia, the most popular among them being wrestling, weightlifting, judo, association football, chess, and boxing. Armenia's mountainous terrain provides great opportunities for the practice of sports like skiing and climbing. Being a landlocked country, water sports can only be practised on lakes, notably [[Lake Sevan]]. Competitively, Armenia has been successful in chess, weightlifting and wrestling at the international level. Armenia is also an active member of the international sports community, with full membership in the Union of European Football Associations ([[UEFA]]) and International Ice Hockey Federation ([[IIHF]]). It also hosts the [[Pan-Armenian Games]].

Prior to 1992, Armenians would participate in the Olympics representing the USSR. As part of the Soviet Union, Armenia was very successful, winning plenty of medals and helping the USSR win the medal standings at the Olympics on numerous occasions. The first medal won by an Armenian in modern Olympic history was by [[Hrant Shahinyan]] (sometimes spelled as Grant Shaginyan), who won two golds and two silvers in gymnastics at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. To highlight the level of success of Armenians in the Olympics, Shahinyan was quoted as saying:

"Armenian sportsmen had to outdo their opponents by several notches for the shot at being accepted into any Soviet team. But those difficulties notwithstanding, 90 percent of Armenian athletes on Soviet Olympic teams came back with medals."&lt;ref name="ArmeniaNow.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.armenianow.com/features/6903/ambassadors_in_sport_independent |title=Ambassadors in Sport?: Independent Armenia far below the glory of Soviet times on the pitch, mat |publisher=[[ArmeniaNow]] |date=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia first participated at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona under a unified CIS team, where it was very successful, winning three golds and one silver in weightlifting, wrestling and sharp shooting, despite only having five athletes. Since the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lillehammer]], Armenia has participated as an independent nation.

Armenia participates in the Summer Olympic Games in boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, judo, gymnastics, track and field, diving, swimming and sharp shooting. It also participates in the Winter Olympic Games in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing and figure skating.

[[File:Levon Aronian 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Chess Grandmaster [[Levon Aronian]] is a [[FIDE]] #2 rated player and the [[Comparison of top chess players throughout history#Elo system|fourth highest rated player in history]]]]
[[Football in Armenia|Football]] is also popular in Armenia. The most successful team was the [[FC Ararat Yerevan]] team of the 1970s who won the [[Soviet Cup]] in 1973 and 1975 and the [[Soviet Top League 1973|Soviet Top League]] in 1973. The latter achievement saw FC Ararat gain entry to the [[European Cup 1974–75|European Cup]] where – despite a home victory in the second leg – they lost on aggregate at the quarter final stage to eventual winner [[FC Bayern Munich]]. Armenia competed internationally as part of the [[USSR national football team]] until the [[Armenian national football team]] was formed in 1992 after the split of the Soviet Union. Armenia have never qualified for a major tournament although recent improvements saw the team to achieve 44th position in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] in September 2011. The national team is controlled by the [[Football Federation of Armenia]]. The [[Armenian Premier League]] is the highest level football competition in Armenia, and has been dominated by [[FC Pyunik]] in recent seasons. The league currently consists of eight teams and relegates to the [[Armenian First League]].

Armenia and the Armenian diaspora have produced many successful footballers, including [[Youri Djorkaeff]], [[Alain Boghossian]], [[Andranik Eskandarian]], [[Andranik Teymourian]], [[Edgar Manucharyan]] and [[Nikita Simonyan]]. Djokaeff and Boghossian won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] with [[France national football team|France]], Andranik Teymourian competed in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] for [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and Edgar Manucharyan played in the Dutch [[Eredivisie]] for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]].

[[Wrestling]] has been a successful sport in the Olympics for Armenia. At the [[Armenia at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Armen Nazaryan]] won the gold in the Men's [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] Flyweight (52&amp;nbsp;kg) category and [[Armen Mkrtchyan]] won the silver in Men's [[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]] Paperweight (48&amp;nbsp;kg) category, securing Armenia's first two medals in its Olympic history.

Traditional Armenian wrestling is called Kokh and practised in traditional garb; it was one of the influences included in the Soviet combat sport of [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]], which is also very popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=ed. by Thomas A.|title=Martial arts of the world : en encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-1-57607-150-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=v32oHSE5t6cC&amp;pg=PA718 718]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Politics of Armenia|government of Armenia]] budgets about $2.8&amp;nbsp;million annually for sports and gives it to the National Committee of Physical Education and Sports, the body that determines which programs should benefit from the funds.&lt;ref name="ArmeniaNow.com"/&gt;

Due to the lack of success lately on the international level, in recent years, Armenia has rebuilt 16 Soviet-era sports schools and furnished them with new equipment for a total cost of $1.9&amp;nbsp;million. The rebuilding of the regional schools was financed by the Armenian government. $9.3&amp;nbsp;million has been invested in the resort town of [[Tsaghkadzor]] to improve the [[winter sport]]s infrastructure because of dismal performances at recent [[winter sport]]s events. In 2005, a cycling centre was opened in [[Yerevan]] with the aim of helping produce world class Armenian cyclists. The government has also promised a cash reward of $700,000 to Armenians who win a gold medal at the Olympics.&lt;ref name="ArmeniaNow.com"/&gt;

Armenia has also been very successful in chess, winning the [[World Team Chess Championship|World Champion]] in 2011 and the [[Chess Olympiad|World Chess Olympiad]] on three occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p004j7zg |title=Armenia: the cleverest nation on earth |publisher=[[BBC World Service]] |date=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuisine ===
[[File:Armenian cuisine.jpg|thumb|left|Armenian cuisine]]
{{Main|Armenian cuisine}}

Armenian cuisine is closely related to eastern and [[Mediterranean cuisine]]; various [[spice]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[fish]], and [[fruit]]s combine to present unique dishes. The main characteristics of Armenian cuisine are a reliance on the quality of the ingredients rather than heavily spicing food, the use of herbs, the use of wheat in a variety of forms, of legumes, nuts, and fruit (as a main ingredient as well as to sour food), and the stuffing of a wide variety of leaves.

The [[pomegranate]], with its symbolic association with fertility, represents that nation. The [[apricot]] is the national fruit.

'''Bell TV''' ({{lang-fr|Bell Télé}}; formerly known as Bell ExpressVu, [[Dish Network]] Canada, ExpressVu Dish Network, and now sometimes known as '''Bell Satellite TV''' to distinguish the service from Bell's [[IPTV]] [[Bell Fibe TV|Fibe TV]] service), is the division of [[BCE Inc.]] that provides [[satellite television]] service across [[Canada]]. It launched on September 10, 1997 and as of 2004 it has been providing "Bell TV for Condos", a [[VDSL]] service provided to select multidwelling units (condominiums and apartments) in [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Toronto]]. Bell TV provides over 500 digital video and 100 HD and [[Galaxie (radio)|audio channels]] to, as of May 2010, over 1.8 million subscribers. Its major competitors include satellite service [[Shaw Direct]], as well as various cable and communications companies across Canada, such as [[Rogers Cable]], [[EastLink (company)|EastLink]], [[Shaw Communications]], [[Vidéotron]] and [[Cogeco]].

Bell TV services are also repackaged and resold by [[Telus]] as [[Telus TV|Telus Satellite TV]], in areas where the latter company's Optik IPTV services are unavailable.

== History ==

===1990s: inception as ExpressVu===
ExpressVu was conceived in 1994, at the time of American [[Digital Satellite Service|DSS]] systems launch, as a consortium of Ontario-based Tee-Comm Electronics, Canadian Satellite Communications ([[Cancom]]), Vancouver-based [[Western International Communications]] (WIC) and Bell Canada Enterprises (BCE), with a projected startup date of late 1995. High technology development costs and delays placed Tee-Comm in a severe financial position, prompting the remaining partners to pull out in 1996.  Instead, U.S. satellite-TV provider [[Echostar]] [[Dish Network]] was chosen to provide the receivers and uplink equipment.  The [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes]] [[DirecTV]] system had already been optioned to [[Power Corporation|Power Broadcasting]], in Canada; it has since been withdrawn. Tee-Comm on its own managed to launch the first [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] service in Canada, [[AlphaStar]], in early 1997; however, in a matter of months the company went bankrupt and the service was discontinued, leaving thousands of consumers with useless receivers (although with some reconfiguration, could be used to receive unencrypted [[Free-to-air|FTA]] channels).  ExpressVu launched service in September 1997, initially as "''Dish Network Canada''", followed by "''ExpressVu Dish Network''", in both cases using the Echostar logo.

===2000s: Bell purchases ExpressVu, later renames it to Bell TV===
[[File:Bell ExpressVu logo.png|thumb|Bell TV's former logo as Bell ExpressVu]]
Bell took over full ownership of ExpressVu by 2000.

The ExpressVu name was retired in August 2008 along with the [[Today Just Got Better]] advertising campaign.  Bell's television services as a whole are now simply called Bell TV.  When disambiguation is required, the satellite service is called Bell Satellite TV.

Plans have been shelved for any additional ExpressVu satellite expenditures assuming pending [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] and [[Industry Canada]] approval for [[Dish Network]] to use all 32 [[transponder]]s on [[Nimiq 5]]. As a result of this, SES has announced that they will not be replacing the ill-fated [[AMC-14 (satellite)|AMC-14]] now that Dish Network has cut this deal with [[Telesat]] &amp; BCE for [[Nimiq 5]] usage.

In 2009, [[Telus]] reached a deal to resell a re-packaged version of the Bell TV service in parts of Alberta and British Columbia known as '''Telus Satellite TV'''. The agreement was designed to allow Telus the ability to "instantly" offer a [[quadruple play]] of services in markets where it has not yet deployed its [[IPTV]] services, while also allowing Bell to increase its television market share in Western Canada. The Telus-branded service co-exists with the Bell-branded version of Bell TV, which is still offered in the markets that Telus Satellite TV is offered.&lt;ref name=gandm-telussattelite&gt;{{cite news|title=The satellite surprise: Telus ties up with BCE|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/the-satellite-surprise-telus-ties-up-with-bce/article1199657/|accessdate=17 October 2015|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s: discontinuation of SDTV receivers traditional theme packages===
In 2012, Bell changed satellite plans in Ontario.  They are now sold in packages called "Good", "Better" and "Best" similarly to its competitor [[Rogers Cable]] in that region.  Channels in the "Best" tier can still be purchased in theme packages, and existing customers with older plans are [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]].  This also does not affect other regions such as [[Quebec]], where there are different types of plans.  Along with these changes, Bell discontinued sales and rentals of its final [[standard-definition television]] (SDTV) receiver, the 4100 model.  Customers who still have an older SDTV with an AV input (or peripheral modulator) can use an HD receiver, but the quality will be limited to [[480i]] due to technical limitations.

== Satellites ==
[[File:SatelliteDishBrickWall.jpg|thumb|A Bell TV satellite dish]]
Bell TV broadcasts from two [[geostationary satellite]]s: ''[[Nimiq]] 4 and 6''. ''Nimiq 4'' was launched on September 19, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satbeams.com/satellites?norad=33373 |title=Satellite Details - Nimiq 4 |publisher=SatBeams |date=2008-09-20 |accessdate=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Nimiq 6'' was launched on May 17, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satbeams.com/satellites?norad=38342 |title=Satellite Details - Nimiq 6 |publisher=SatBeams |date=2012-05-17 |accessdate=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both satellites follow an equatorial path, giving coverage to most of Canada. ''Nimiq'' is an [[Inuktitut language|Inuktitut]] word for "that which unifies" and was chosen from a nationwide naming contest in 1998. The two satellites are owned and operated by [[Telesat]] Canada. Bell's uplink site is located in [[North York]], Toronto, Ontario.

''Nimiq 4'', located at 82° W primarily serves Bell's [[high-definition television]] content. ''Nimiq 6'', located at 91.1° W primarily serves Bell's [[standard-definition television]] and radio content. Each satellite has 32 [[Ku-band]] [[transponders]]. A transponder usually has enough bandwidth to broadcast approximately 10 channels. Because HDTV requires more bandwidth, some transponders typically broadcast only 4-5 channels. LyngSat provides a listing of channels on [http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/Bell-TV-82W.html ''Nimiq 4''] and [http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/Bell-TV-91W.html ''Nimiq 6''] broken down by transponder.

===Past satellites===
''Nimiq 1'' was launched on May 20, 1999 and contains 32 Ku-band transponders. at 91° W. (From the time of service launch in 1997 to the switch to ''Nimiq'' in 1999, ExpressVu used the already crowded ''[[Anik (satellite)|Anik]] E2''.) ''Nimiq 2'', launched on December 29, 2002, also includes 32 K-band transponders. ''Nimiq 2'' provides [[High-definition television|HDTV]], international programming, and all newly released channels.  It occupies the 82° W slot.  ''Nimiq 3'' went online on August 23, 2004. Originally called ''DirecTV3'', it is an old [[DirecTV]] satellite moved to a new orbital slot near ''Nimiq 1'' to offload some of the transmitting work from the original satellite.  In February 2006, ''Nimiq 3'' was moved behind ''Nimiq 2'' to support it, while another satellite, ''Nimiq 4i'' (formerly ''DirecTV2''), took ''Nimiq 3'''s spot behind ''Nimiq 1''. ''Nimiq 4i'' was [https://web.archive.org/web/20071008050221/http://bellsrdu.ca/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3 replaced] with ''Nimiq 4iR'' as it ran out of fuel on April 28, 2007 and was de-orbited. Both ''Nimiq 3'' and ''Nimiq 4iR'' feature 16 Ku-band transponders. ''Nimiq 4'' was launched by a [[Proton rocket]] which lifted off on September 19, 2008 at 21:48 UTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iNN_smaVbrC1zoSslZGdh9KNK9cA |title=Russia launches Canadian telecom satellite: report |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=September 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922155520/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iNN_smaVbrC1zoSslZGdh9KNK9cA |archivedate=September 22, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==

===Receivers===
Bell TV satellite receivers are manufactured for Echostar by Sanmina-SCI in Guadalajara, Mexico. Two different [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) receivers are currently provided, with either optional or built-in [[Digital video recorder|personal video recorder]] (PVR) capabilities:
* '''HD Receiver''' (6400) is a single-tuner HDTV receiver which decodes MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 signals. It offers both an [[HDMI]] and [[composite video]] output but removed [[component video]] output that was included on the 6131 model connectors for HDTV purposes. It does not include an internal [[hard disk drive]], but can receive PVR capabilities when an external hard disk drive is connected to its [[USB]] 2.0 port.  The drive stores a one-hour [[data buffer]], allowing one to rewind and pause a live TV program for that time period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bell.ca/shopping/PrsShpTv_DTH_BestHDPVR.page?EXT=XVU_SA_200808008_EHD_LC_supppg]&lt;/ref&gt;  The iTV button on the 6400's remote has been replaced by a "Movies" button because the receiver does not support iTV.
* '''HD PVR Plus Receiver''' (9400) is Bell TV's latest HDTV receiver, released in 2012.  It is slim like the 6400 and succeeds the larger 9241.  The company claims it is "Canada's best HD PVR" in its advertisements, despite having fewer features than older receivers as well as an internal hard disk drive with less storage than those of competitors.  The HD PVR Plus's main advantage is its internal hard drive with 1 TB of storage, enough for up to 500 hours of SDTV or 75 hours of HDTV (upgraded to 150 hours of HDTV with a recent software update due to the switch from [[MPEG-2]] to [[MPEG-4]]).  Additionally, the receiver's dual tuners allow the user to watch one channel while recording it and/or another.

Bell has discontinued older receivers which either only supported [[standard-definition television]] (SDTV) or included a series of features that newer receivers no longer offer.  Receivers discontinued by Bell include the 4100, Bell's last [[standard-definition television]] (SDTV) receiver sold until March 2012.  It is compact and provides [[coaxial cable]], [[composite video]], [[S-Video]] and [[TOSLINK]] outputs.  It had no built-in PVR capabilities, requiring an external device such as a [[videocassette recorder]] (VCR) or [[DVD recorder]] to record shows.  Prior to this, Bell discontinued the 5900 single tuner SDTV PVR receiver with a built-in hard drive to record up to 80 hours of programming.  Features absent in Bell's current receivers but available in older receivers include [[picture-in-picture]] (watching two channels simultaneously on one TV) and a tuner for [[over-the-air programming]] (OTA programming) support.  Having an OTA tuner can potentially allow access to unavailable or optional channels such as those of American networks.

Current HD receivers support the 480i, 480p, 720p and 1080i resolutions.  1080p is not supported, despite claims to the contrary by Bell.  To allow [[backward compatibility]] with older SDTVs and due to the fact that non-HD receivers are no longer sold, HD receivers are compatible with a composite video or S-Video connection.  A separate adapter is required for legacy coaxial cable connections.  All three methods only provide a 480i resolution due to technical limitations.  The star (*) and PAGE UP buttons of the remote add a zoom, partial zoom, stretch or gray bars.  The purpose of the latter is to prevent [[Phosphor burn-in|burn-in]] on plasma televisions.

===Remotes===
Many types of remotes have been released over the years.  Models 1000 and 2700 came out with very basic infrared (IR) remotes that could be used only to control the receivers themselves and would operate on all 16 remote addresses.  Replacement remotes then came with universal functions allowing users to control the power and volume of their televisions along with VCRs and sound system receivers; these remotes can only operate on a single address at a time.  Models equipped with a UHF antenna can respond to UHF remotes; these remotes use radio frequencies rather than IR signals to control the receivers.  UHF signals can reach up to 30 meters, depending on the restrictions of building materials.  All UHF-compatible receivers can simultaneously respond to IR signals except for model 4500.  For this model, modification directions exist on the Internet to add IR receiving capability, in order for the receiver to respond to programmable universal remotes.  Remote #2 of the 3200, 5200, 9200, and the remote for model 6100 are based on "UHF Pro".  "UHF Pro" remotes are strictly compatible with the receivers they are provided with and do not function on regular UHF-compatible receivers.  Additionally, "UHF Pro" remotes can only communicate with UHF frequencies and cannot control receivers via IR.  To prevent interference with other UHF remotes in proximity, clients should change their remote addresses.  All secondary remotes for dual tuners may also be converted to remote #1 by flipping the plastic bottom of the remote.  This also switches its transmission mode from UHF Pro to regular UHF and IR, similar to how a 5900 remote operates.

===Satellite dishes===
Bell TV currently provides 50&amp;nbsp;cm (20") dishes to its customers.  Canadians living in the territories and certain parts of British Columbia and northern mainland portion of Newfoundland and Labrador require larger dishes between 60 and 120&amp;nbsp;cm; these are used to compensate for the weaker satellite signal available to these regions.  The 50&amp;nbsp;cm dish supports two [[Low-noise block converter|LNB]]s.  The size of the dish was increased from 18 to 20&amp;nbsp;inches in late 2001 to accommodate a second LNB to acquire signal from ''Nimiq 2'' (BEV 82) satellite.  At the end of the dish's arm, a Y-adapter is found which holds both LNBs.  The BEV 91 LNB is in the centre of the dish while the BEV 82 LNB is offset to the left.  Rotating the dish (i.e., modifying the skew angle) changes the position of the 82 LNB while maintaining position for BEV 91.  A switchbox, typically an SW21 or SW44, is used to merge both satellite signals into receivers.

===Smartcards===
To authorize programming, a portable smartcard is used for older receivers.  This includes the 1000, 2700, 2800, 3000, 3100, 3500, 3700, 4000, 4500, 4700, 5100, 5800, 5900 and the 6000.  In some cases, Bell TV has switched back to using standard smartcards for the 6100 9200 and 9400 receivers.

In February 2008, Bell TV announced a second smartcard swap involving all its receivers with the exception of the 6141 and 9241 models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bell.ca/support/PrsCSrvTv_DTH_CardSwap.page|title=Bell Customer Support Centre|author=|date=|website=www.bell.ca|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was required due to the massive intrusion of ExpressVu signals that occurred with the [[Nagravision]] 2 encryption.  The latter standard was implemented on May 27, 2005, to end the unlicensed access that occurred with the first Nagravision system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bce.ca/en/news/releases/bev/2005/05/27/72410.html | title=Bell Canada to Introduce New Signal Encryption System for its Satellite TV Service | last1=Prendergast | first1=Nessa | publisher=Bell Media Relations | accessdate=2011-12-21 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014213036/http://www.bce.ca/en/news/releases/bev/2005/05/27/72410.html | archivedate=2008-10-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell TV has upgraded to Nagravision 3 as the new encryption standard, to prevent unauthorized access to pay TV channels. The only means to view Bell TV illegally is through IKS (Internet Key Sharing) devices which include NFusion FTA and the Slinger. Both devices are not hacks but only means of a workaround. Bell TV is currently working towards shutting down these types of devices. No known hacks exist for the Nagravision 3 protocol.

Newer receivers incorporate smartchips instead, which are permanently installed inside the receiver. According to Bell Tech Support, a 4100 with smartchip will require a newer smartcard upgrade.

===Unsupported hardware===
In 2009, Bell 6000 receiver owners received letters in the mail that state they must swap to a 6141 or face losing programming as Bell TV deployed MPEG-4 with 8PSK.  The 6000 does support the use of 8PSK with an add-in module, but Bell TV decided not to send out these as the 6000 is old and most customers will be wanting to upgrade to a 6141 which can have a hard disk drive added to it to be used as a PVR.  The guide for programming information is also updated and stores more information in its database than the 6000.

Later, starting in October 2011, Bell announced that it would replace all currently active [[MPEG-2]] HD satellite receivers, specifically the 6100 and 9200 models, with [[MPEG-4]] HD receivers.  This is to allow current HD channels to be encoded in MPEG-4 instead of MPEG-2, providing free space for 43 additional local standard definition channels which will begin airing in September 2012.  6100 owners will receive the latest 6131 HD receiver, while 9200 owners will receive either a 9241 or a 9242.  If the 9200 receiver was used for two televisions, Bell will provide either a 9241 with a 5900 or a 9242.  Both setups permit the two televisions to watch Bell TV but recording and playback with the 5900 does not equal the 9200 for the second TV.  About 240 000 receivers in 193 000 homes will be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitalhome.ca/2011/10/bell-tv-to-replace-240000-satellite-receivers/ | title=Bell TV to replace 240,000 HD satellite receivers | last1=Thompson | first1=Hugh | publisher=Digital Home | accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==

=== 3D television ===
3D television ([[3DTV]]) is available across Canada with Bell TV. The 2010 Masters Tournament on Bell TV was the first national 3D broadcast, making Bell TV the first Canadian satellite television service to broadcast in 3D. Content will be available free of charge to Bell HDTV subscribers, although a 3D HDTV and 3D glasses are required to view 3D programming.&lt;ref&gt;http://tvonline.bell.ca/tvonline/servlet/CommandServlet?command=flow&amp;lang=EN&amp;processid=100&amp;PPV_ASSET_ID=206114&amp;INT=TV_hmpg_BAN_HDMASTERS_Mass_20100409_cb_all_en&lt;/ref&gt;

===Installation===
&lt;!-- Old Installation section is moved to User:True Tech Talk Time/Bell TV bloat ---&gt;
[[File:GMC Safari Bell TV.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chevrolet Astro|GMC Safari]] van from the old Bell ExpressVu era before becoming Bell TV]]
Bell normally provides free installation to new customers for their first PVR in exchange of a two-year contract.  There is still a one-time activation fee of no more than $50 to pay.  On [[Bell Media]] television channels, Bell advertises this as "One phone call can get you set up as early as tomorrow."

One to four receivers are typically connected to a single satellite dish.  Setting up a greater number of receivers is more complicated and costly, so Bell does not provide setup in such circumstances.  Customers are free to set up more than four receivers at their own risk.  This also applies to any self-installed equipment such as [[Used good|second-hand]] receivers.  Bell's receiver limits can prove to be challenging for larger homes or [[multi-family residential]] units because landlords tend to prohibit the installation of more than one satellite dish.

Residential accounts are limited to a maximum of six (6) receivers per account, but each of them can be a dual tuner receiver; therefore up to 12 televisions can be served however the current receiver lineup offered by Bell does not support 2 televisions as the 9242 receiver was discontinued. [[Account stacking]], which consists of having receivers on one account located in different locations, is contrary to the Bell TV Residential and Commercial Agreements.  It is certainly not illegal, and in a worst-case scenario, service will be cancelled.  This practice is detailed in CRTC Public Notice 2006-133 and 2006-134.  There is no requirement whatsoever in the Regulations that prohibits a BDU (broadcast distribution undertaking) from providing service at more than one location via a single account.  Bell has mostly focused on improving its satellite signal reception in Canada while seeking to prevent [[Snowbird (people)|snowbirds]] from accessing this signal.  The use of Bell TV services in the United States is not illegal, but it remains a controversial issue.

===Interactive services===
Current and many past receiver models support interactive services, branded as iTV, offering information services for weather and sports.  When watching [[The Weather Network]], for example, one can select their local city to receive detailed information about that city's weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bell.ca/Bell_TV/Products/The_Weather_Network | title=The Weather Network Interactive | publisher=Bell Canada | accessdate=2012-03-03 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222093928/http://www.bell.ca/Bell_TV/Products/The_Weather_Network | archivedate=2012-02-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For sports such as [[NFL Sunday Ticket]] or [[NHL Centre Ice]], iTV allows fans to simultaneously keep track of multiple games.  This means that when the watcher is concentrating on one single game, they will be notified if the score changes for other games.

Basic video games, lottery results and horoscopes were previously available as Bell TV interactive services. [[Pornography]]-themed video games were also offered in the past via Bell's [[sex industry]] brand, [[Vu!|Venus]].  These services have been discontinued as part of the [[Today Just Got Better]] rebranding.  Wireless game controllers, sold for use with Game Galaxy and Venus Games, have been cleared out for the price of $4.99 each at Bell-owned [[The Source (retailer)|The Source]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forums.redflagdeals.com/source-daily-deal-bell-tv-gaming-remote-universal-remote-4-99-a-1024791/ | title=Thread: The Source daily deal - BELL TV GAMING REMOTE (universal remote) - $4.99 | publisher=[[RedFlagDeals]] | accessdate=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pay-per-view===
[[Pay-per-view]] (PPV) events may be ordered either via the receiver itself with a remote control and phone line connection, via Bell's website, or via an automated phone system.  Regular movies tend to cost less, while adult and sports programming have a higher cost.  Channel 299 previously featured classic movies at 99 cents each, but this channel has been pulled off the air in 2011.  Bell TV carries movies recently released on DVD along with major sporting events including boxing, [[WWE]] and [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]. '''Red Carpet Vu!''' is a Pay-per-view movie service broadcast in a group of up to ten different channels where a daily featured movie starts every fifteen minutes.

Some customers have the misconception that the optional phone line, when plugged into the receiver, is used for software downloads and programming changes.  In fact, the only information the line receives, if available from and supported by the phone line, consists of [[caller ID]] informations displayed in a pop-up notification for the viewer's convenience when a phone call is being received.  The phone line simply automates the process of ordering pay-per-view by dialing out the Event ID and other information that would be requested by manually calling the pay-per-view phone system.

===Support and warranties===
Bell TV provides technical support 24/7, however it will only support its products.  Any type of picture troubleshooting must be done with a direct connection from the receiver to the television.  For new customers, the first receiver is normally installed at no cost to the customer.

All labour for installations is only under warranty for three (3) months.  Receivers are under warranty for as long as they are rented.  Purchased equipment comes with a default warranty of one year with the option of taking an extended warranty.  Only manufacturer's defects will warrant replacement of a dish under coverage, as a strict policy is in place regarding "Acts of God" and dish damage, which includes violent weather disabling a dish or mis-aligning it, as well as any physical modifications by the customer such as painting the dish.

==Satellite alternatives==
&lt;!-- This section concerns ONLY Bell services, NOT competitors' offerings. ---&gt;
Although Bell Satellite TV continues to be Bell's most widespread method of watching television in Canada, the company also offers [[IPTV]] and [[mobile television]] services where available.

===Bell Fibe TV===
{{main|Bell Fibe TV}}
The [[Bell Fibe TV]] service is an implementation of [[IPTV]] that uses [[VDSL]] to deliver television service via telephone lines.  Early versions of this service was originally deployed as "Bell ExpressVu for Condos" to get around restrictions regarding the mounting of satellite dishes.  The original service was trialled using "NextLevel Communications" (now part of Motorola) set-top boxes that receive television broadcasts over VDSL in [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] form.  The network infrastructure can support large amounts of bandwidth (typically 25 Mbit/s, as of January 2012) and is available in certain cities, including Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec City.

===Bell Mobile TV===
{{main|Bell Mobile TV}}
Since October 18, 2010, [[Bell Mobility]] allows [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s on either its [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] network to access Mobile TV. [[Virgin Mobile Canada]] customers can also access Mobile TV.  Similar systems by Bell in the past used the phased-out [[CDMA2000|CDMA]] network.  Unlimited access via [[Wi-Fi]] was previously available, but has since been discontinued.  The service is billed per hour, and customers do not pay any additional fees.

== Channels ==
Bell TV currently features over 500 channels including all major Canadian &amp; American networks, premium movie services, [[Vu!]] pay-per-view service, [[music radio]], sports, international and adult programming.  The company provides over 100 High Definition channels, which used to be the most in Canada, until Shaw Direct launched its new satellite Anik G1 on May 29, 2013, giving Shaw Direct customers access to over 210 HD channels.&lt;ref&gt;http://channel.bell.ca/en/ Bell TV Announces over 100 HD Channels!&lt;/ref&gt;  Bell TV's programming changes constantly.

== Show and Extra magazines ==
Bell TV produced a monthly magazine called ''Show'' (the French version is called ''Extra'').  Show debuted in September 2007, and replaced Bell TV Magazine, the previous name for the customer publication from ExpressVu.

Show was delivered to over 800,000 Bell TV customers and showcases entertainment from Canada, Hollywood and around the world.

Show Magazine and Extra had been cancelled by Bell TV to save paper in early 2008.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Diplomatic relations between the '''[[People's Republic of China]]''' and the '''[[Republic of Burundi]]''' were established on December 21, 1963 under [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Rulers and heads of state of Burundi|King]] [[Mwambutsa IV Bangiriceng of Burundi|Mwambutsa IV Bangiriceng]], respectively.&lt;ref name="FMPRC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Burundi |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China |date=October 12, 2003 |accessdate=November 1, 2009 |url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjb/zzjg/fzs/gjlb/2929/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  King Mwambutsa broke off diplomatic relations with China in 1965, although they were restored under [[Michel Micombero]] the first [[List of Presidents of Burundi|President of Burundi]], on October 31, 1971.&lt;ref name=FMPRC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=People's Daily Online -- China hopes toenhance cooperation with Burundi: China's top political advisor |publisher=[[People's Daily]] |accessdate=November 1, 2009 |url=http://english.people.com.cn/200611/06/eng20061106_318807.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, China has provided development aid to Burundi, including helping with the construction of a [[textiles]] mill in [[Bujumbura]].&lt;ref name=FMPRC /&gt; As of 2002, China exported [[United States Dollar|$]]2.718 worth of goods, while importing only $491,000 worth of goods from Burundi.&lt;ref name=FMPRC /&gt; The current Chinese [[ambassador]] to Burundi is Feng Zhijun.&lt;ref name=FMPRC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chinese Embassy – Chinese Embassy in The Republic of Burundi |publisher=Chinese-Embassy.com |accessdate=November 1, 2009 |url=http://chinese-embassy.com/chinese-embassy-in-burundi.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After boiling, the ''cepelinai'' are often served with [[sour cream]] sauce and [[bacon]] bits&lt;ref name="Jacob Ashkenazi 2014 p. 793"/&gt; or [[pork rind]]s.

In Poland, it is known as kartacz. It is a part of the cuisine of [[Podlachia]].

The '''Committee for Non-Violent Action''' ('''CNVA''') was an American anti-war group, formed in 1957 to resist the [[US government]]'s program of [[nuclear weapons]] testing. It was one of the first organizations to employ [[nonviolent]] [[direct action]] to protest against the [[nuclear arms race]].

The CNVA's immediate antecedent, a committee known as Non-Violent Action Against Nuclear Weapons, was formed by radical [[Quaker]] [[Lawrence Scott (Quaker)|Lawrence Scott]]. Other leaders of the CNVA included [[A.J. Muste]], [[Albert Bigelow]], [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[George Willoughby (activist)|George Willoughby]].

==History==
In August 1957, members of the CNVA were arrested when they attempted to enter the Camp Mercury nuclear testing grounds near [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. In February 1958, Albert Bigelow and the crew of the ''Golden Rule'' were intercepted by the [[US Coast Guard]] five nautical miles (9&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] as they attempted to sail their vessel into the [[Eniwetok]] Proving Grounds, the US test site in the [[Marshall Islands]]. Two further attempts to defy a hastily enacted regulation banning US citizens from sailing to the test site led to the arrest and 60-day imprisonment of the crew.

The voyage of the ''Golden Rule'' inspired anthropologist [[Earle L. Reynolds]] and his family to undertake a similar journey, and on 1 July 1958, their yacht, ''[[Phoenix of Hiroshima]]'', entered the test zone at [[Bikini Atoll]]. The ''Phoenix'' penetrated {{convert|65|nmi|km|0}} into the test area before the vessel was boarded by the Coast Guard and ordered to sail to [[Kwajalein]] atoll, where Reynolds was charged with violating the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]'s new regulation.

In 1959, CNVA sponsored protests at the construction site of an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] near [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Around 15 protestors, including A.J. Muste and [[Karl Meyer (activist)|Karl H. Meyer]], the son of [[Vermont]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[William H. Meyer|William Meyer]],&lt;ref&gt;"Congressman's son, a pacifist, is jailed", ''The New York Times.'' July 11, 1959. Retrieved 4/21/08.&lt;/ref&gt; were arrested and handcuffed as they climbed the fence to invade the site. They were each sentenced to six months in jail. In 1960, the group co-ordinated nonviolent protests against construction of the nuclear weapons equipped [[Polaris]] submarine in [[New London, Connecticut]].

During the early 1960s, the CNVA organised two [[American-Soviet Peace Walks|'Walks for Peace']], including a {{convert|6000|mi|km|-2|sing=on}} march from [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] to [[Moscow]], during which the walkers called on the governments of the world to disarm. During a Walk for Peace from [[Quebec]] to [[Cuba]], via [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], walkers were attacked and jailed as black and white activists walked together through [[Macon, Georgia]]. Both walks were led by peace activist [[Bradford Lyttle]]. 

In the mid-1960s, CNVA began to focus on the [[Vietnam War]]. Activists traveled to [[Hanoi]] in [[Vietnam]] and picketed the US embassy, and the CNVA advocated [[tax refusal]] as a method of resistance.

In 1968, after the 1967 death of leader A.J. Muste, the CNVA merged with the [[pacifist]] [[War Resisters League]].

==Legacy==
While never a mass-membership organization, the CNVA's pioneering use of [[nonviolent direct action]] would have a significant influence on movements to follow. In particular, it was the example set by the voyages of the ''Golden Rule'' and the ''Phoenix'' that would inspire the first [[Greenpeace]] activists to use similar methods in their campaigns to halt nuclear testing at the island of [[Amchitka]], [[Alaska]], and at [[Muraroa Atoll]] in the [[Pacific]].{{cn|date=December 2016}}

'''"Diese Welt"''' ("This World") was the [[Germany|German]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971]], performed in [[German language|German]] by [[Katja Ebstein]]. This was Ebstein's second, consecutive Eurovision entry; she had represented Germany at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1970|1970 contest]] with "[[Wunder gibt es immer wieder]]", which finished 3rd in a field of 12.

"Diese Welt" was performed fifth on the night (following [[Switzerland]]'s [[Peter, Sue &amp; Marc]] with "[[Les illusions de nos vingt ans]]" and preceding [[Spain]]'s [[Maribel Llaudes aka Karina|Karina]] with "[[En un mundo nuevo]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 100 points, placing 3rd in a field of 18.

The song deals with the wonder of the world, with Ebstein singing that it "is a gift which life gave us" and reminding her listeners that what becomes of it is up to its inhabitants. Ebstein also recorded the song in English (as "River Run, River Flow"), French ("Une autre rivière") and Spanish ("Este mundo").

It was succeeded as [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest|German representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972 Contest]] by [[Mary Roos]] with "[[Nur die Liebe läßt uns leben]]". Ebstein returned a third time to the Contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]] with "[[Theater (song)|Theater]]".

The '''Eastern Caribbean Currency Union''' ('''ECCU''') is a development of the [[Organization of Eastern Caribbean States]]. This organization is composed of [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], [[St. Lucia]], and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]. It is under the supervision of the [[Eastern Caribbean Central Bank]]. The member countries use a common currency, the [[East Caribbean dollar]], which is pegged at EC$2.70 to US$1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/business/eccu-commemorates-34th-anniversary-of-ec-dollar-peg-to-the-us-dollar/|title=ECCU commemorates 34th Anniversary of EC dollar pegged to the US dollar|work=Dominica News Online|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9526">The '''European Endangered Species Programme''' ('''EEP''') is a population management programme for animals of the [[European Association of Zoos and Aquaria]] (EAZA).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eaza.net/conservation/programmes/|title=PROGRAMMES » EAZA|website=www.eaza.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the worldwide assembly of such regional [[captive breeding|breeding program]]s for threatened species in zoos. The North America counterpart is the [[Species Survival Plan]] (SSP), while Australian, Japanese and Indian zoos also have similar programs. Combined, there are now many hundred zoos worldwide involved in the regional breeding programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kraniche.vogelfreund.net/englisch/conservation/index.html|title=European Endangered Species Programme|last=|first=|date=3 June 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each EEP has a coordinator who is assisted by a species committee. The coordinator collects information on the status of all the animals kept in EAZA zoos and aquariums of the species for which he or she is responsible, produces a studbook, carries out demographical and genetic analyses, produces a plan for the future management of the species and provides recommendations to participating institutions. Together with the Species Committee, recommendations are made each year about relocating and breeding animals, and the conditions of such a move (breeding loan, exchange, term free disposition, etc.).

EAZA is an organization for the European zoo and aquarium community that links over 340 membership organizations in 41 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eaza.net/about/Pages/Introduction.aspx|title=About EAZA|last=|first=|date=11 October 2011|website=eaza.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mission of EAZA is to promote cooperation for furthering regional collection planning and wildlife conservation, mainly through coordinated breeding programs of wild animals such as EEP and European Studbook (ESB), which is less intensive than the EEP. Even though EEP participation is mainly reserved for EAZA collections, it is possible for non-EAZA collections to be included in these programmes. There are generally however more restrictions on such zoos (which may go as far as only holding non-breeding animals for educational purposes), and on the number of programmes they may participate in.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Important species==
[[File:Male_gorilla_in_SF_zoo.jpg|alt=Male gorilla in SF zoo.jpg by Brocken Inaglory|thumb|246x246px|Gorillas are stocky animals with broad chests and shoulders, large, human-like hands and small eyes set into hairless faces.]]

=== Sumatran tiger (''Panthera tigris sumatrae'') ===
One species which has been handled by EEP was [[Sumatran tiger]] which have only a few hundred left in the wild, and only about 7% of their habitat remains. They used to live in all the Sumatran territory, but nowadays most of them can only be found in the mountain regions of the Burit Barisan volcanic area. This species is currently threatened with the destruction of habitat and poaching, for trade of its parts in traditional oriental medicine or as a trophy. The Tiger EEP has made contributions to the conservation of Amur and Sumatran tigers in the wild, via fundraising for wild tiger conservation projects, raising awareness and providing educational opportunities, and assisting with relevant research and training. For example, in November 2011, Sumatran tiger Kirana has delivered 3 cubs at [[Chester Zoo]] under EEP which attempts to coordinate breeding between zoos and maintain genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/offbeat/articles/2016-04-27/3-sumatran-tiger-cubs-step-out-at-san-diego-zoo|title=Three endangered Sumatran tiger cubs have made their debut at San Diego Zoo Safari Park.|last=|first=|date=27 April 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gorilla (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') ===
The Gorilla EEP is one of the most intensively managed and oldest breeding programmes in European zoos. The Gorilla EEP was started in 1987 and was run by the Frankfurt Zoological Garden, who continue to maintain the Gorilla Studbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gorillagazette.com/workshops.htm|title=2010 Gorilla Workshops|last=Armstrong|first=Beth|date=3 June 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past decade, some major improvements have been achieved in the management of the EEP for the Western lowland gorilla ''Gorilla gorilla gorilla''. Neonatal mortality and hand‐rearing rates have decreased; transfers in most cases proved to be successful: almost all gorillas were integrated into their new groups and most animals introduced to a breeding group had their first offspring within 2 years. The results show that the current management approach is successful, and that the population is sustainable and has good genetic health.&lt;ref name="VermeerAbelló2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vermeer|first1=J.|last2=Abelló|first2=M. T.|last3=Holtkötter|first3=M.|date=30 July 2013|title=Progress in the Western lowland gorilla                             European Endangered Species Programme: a review of the decade 2002-2011|journal=International Zoo Yearbook|volume=48|issue=1|pages=234–249 |issn=0074-9664|doi=10.1111/izy.12027|via= |accessdate=3 June 2018|url=https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/376381|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Necessity of international cooperation in breeding programmes ==
For zoo visitors to have the opportunity to see how wild animals look, live, and behave, zoos must ensure that truly wild animals, with all of their natural characteristics, are presented. Zoo animals are vulnerable to three very serious breeding problems inherent to small, artificial populations: inbreeding depression, loss of genetic variability, and accumulation of deleterious mutations. These problems can easily result in loss of original wild traits, and in the expression of heritable abnormalities. If what was once a pure, wild population of animals deteriorates through generations of uncontrolled breeding into inferior or partially domesticated stock, then the animals are no longer suitable for any conservation effort, and the zoos have failed to perform an important educational task.

The effects of breeding [[Captive breeding|captive populations]] of wild animals over periods of many generations have been well studied. Based on these studies and genetic theory, guidelines for breeding such small populations have been developed. Following such guidelines should sharply reduce possibilities of breeding problems and concurrently should maximize the number of generations in which the original founding diversity can be maintained. Guidelines for captive populations follow some basic principles including beginning with as many "founders" as possible (preferably at least 20-30 of animals), increase the number of individuals within the population rapidly, all individuals from the founder population should have "equal genetic representation" and inbreeding should be avoided. The application of these guidelines, and many others tailored to specific populations, results in strictly controlled breeding programmes in which nothing is left to chance. Only in this manner can healthy and truly wild populations be maintained over a period of one or two hundred years. Such strict control is entirely dependent on cooperation among zoos that hold individuals of the species, as single zoos generally do not have the facilities to maintain a population of adequate size independently.

== Challenges ==
The largest problem encountered in the functioning of the EEP is undoubtedly the actual execution of breeding management recommendations: it is often difficult to develop policies applicable to an entire group of zoos (varying from 10 to well over 50 depending on the species programme) when these are spread throughout several countries with different languages and laws, and with dissimilar political and economic backgrounds. Just the incongruencies in laws can sometimes make exchange of specimens for breeding purposes by two closely situated zoos a formidable task if a border happens to lie between them. Yet successes have been achieved: the growth of the EEP has been considerable since its initiation in 1985. Now more than 200 zoos from 25 European countries are involved in breeding programmes, while the EEP is strongly supported by the various national zoo federations and by the European Community Association of Zoos and Aquaria (ECAZA). Currently, preparations are being made to find a pan-European zoo association that, among other tasks, will be responsible for EEP affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kraniche.vogelfreund.net/englisch/conservation/index.html|title=EEP - European Conservation Program|last=|first=|date=3 June 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hulen''' ('The Cave') is a student-driven rock club in [[Bergen]], Norway, that opened on 17 May 1969.&lt;ref name="bt40"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bergtatt igjen|last=Fossen|first=Erik|date=26 September 2009|work=BTMagasinet|publisher=[[Bergens Tidende]]|pages=12–15|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ba40"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ba.no/puls/article4540218.ece|title=Hulen fyller 40|last=Brøske|first=Bjørn Tore|date=26 August 2009|work=Bergensavisen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2009-09-30|location=Bergen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hulen has its premises in an old bomb shelter below [[Nygårdshøyden]] in the city center of Bergen. The shelter is rented from the [[Norwegian Civil Defence]].&lt;ref name="bt40"/&gt; During its 40 years of existence Hulen has been threatened with bankruptcy etc., but has managed to continue because of their volunteers and supporters.&lt;ref name="bt40"/&gt;

==History==
Hulen was once an air-raid shelter, which in 1968 was converted into a club for local students in Bergen, and opened on 17 May 1969.&lt;ref name="HulenHomePage"&gt;.[http://hulen.no/Historikk/ History section at Hulen's homepage](in Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; The reason was partly that the students' old resident, Parkveien 1, was torn down.&lt;ref name="HulenHomePage"/&gt; In over 42 years that have elapsed since that time Hulen has also always served as a cultural alternative for students and music people.&lt;ref name="HulenHomePage"/&gt; Hulen is driven by pure idealism.&lt;ref name="HulenHomePage"/&gt; Around 80 people sacrifice some of their best years to keep the wheels rolling in the cave.&lt;ref name="HulenHomePage"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4416">'''INDEP - Indústrias Nacionais de Defesa, EP''' (Defense National Industries, Public Corporation) was a defense industry company owned by the [[Portugal|Portuguese Government]] and created to replace the ''[[Fábrica Nacional de Munições|Fábrica Nacional de Munições de Armas Ligeiras]]'' (National Light Armament Ammunition Factory, FNMAL) and the ''[[Fábrica do Braço de Prata|Fábrica Militar do Braço de Prata]]'' (FMBP)&lt;ref name="apcm" /&gt; under the control of the National Defense Ministry.&lt;ref name="dl51580" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dl3581" /&gt; However, these two companies never completely closed. They merged and continued to exist under the management of INDEP with the new names ''Fábrica Nacional de Munições'' (FNM) and ''Fábrica de Braço de Prata'' (FBP), respectively. The National Defense Ministry also never took complete control of INDEP and required authorization of the Finance Ministry.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="industriasmilitares" /&gt;

On its creation, many of the products FNM and FBP  made were branded and marketed under INDEP.

In December 1996, a new reorganization of the Portuguese government-owned defense industries started and a new [[holding company]], [[EMPORDEF]], was created in March 1997.&lt;ref name="dl28796" /&gt; The reduction of the national military manufacturing industry lead to the closing of all factories. INDEP was deactivated in December 2003 and closed for good in 2007.&lt;ref name="industriasmilitares" /&gt;

== Companies ==
* ''[[Fábrica Nacional de Munições]]''
** ''Fábrica de Pólvora e Explosivos de Barcarena''
* ''[[Fábrica do Braço de Prata]]''

A '''''kantharos''''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|n|θ|ə|ˌ|r|ɒ|s}} ({{lang-grc|κάνθαρος}}) or '''cantharus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|n|θ|ə|r|ə|s}} is a type of ancient Greek cup used for drinking. Although almost all surviving examples are in [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|Greek pottery]], the shape, like many Greek vessel types, probably originates in metalwork. In its iconic "Type A" form, it is characterized by its deep bowl,  tall pedestal foot, and pair of high-swung handles which extend above the lip of the pot.  The Greek words '''''kotylos''''' (κότῦλος, masculine) and '''''kotyle''''' (κοτύλη, feminine) are other ancient names for this same shape.&lt;ref name="ClarkElston2002"&gt;{{citation|author1=Andrew J. Clark|author2=Maya Elston|author3=Mary Louise Hart|title=Understanding Greek Vases: A Guide to Terms, Styles, and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EcRObeFJmDkC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2002|publisher=Getty |isbn=978-0-89236-599-9|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''kantharos'' is a cup used to hold [[wine]], possibly for drinking or for [[ritual]] use or [[Sacrifice|offerings]]. The ''kantharos'' seems to be an attribute of [[Dionysos]], the god of wine, who was associated with [[Vegetation deity|vegetation]] and [[fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;George W. Elderkin, Kantharos: Studies in Dionysiac and Kindred Cult (Princeton: Princeton University Press 1924):4&lt;/ref&gt; 

As well as a banqueting cup, they could be used in pagan rituals as a symbol of [[Dying-and-rising god|rebirth or resurrection]], the [[immortality]] offered by wine, "removing in moments of ecstasy the burden of self-consciousness and elevating man to the rank of deity."&lt;ref&gt;Elderkin, Kantharos: Studies in Dionysiac and Kindred Cult, 2-6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russia]] is home to the most inscribed sites with 8 sites, two of which are transborder properties shared with [[Mongolia]] in [[List of World Heritage Sites in Eastern Asia|Eastern Asia]].&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list |title=World Heritage List |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first site from the region was the [[Itchan Kala]] in Uzbekistan inscribed in 1990.&lt;ref name="SitebyYear"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;action=stat&amp;mode=table#s4 |title=Number of World Heritage properties inscribed each Year |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, UNESCO's [[World Heritage Committee]] may inscribe new sites on the list, or delist sites that no longer meet the criteria. Selection is based on [[World Heritage site#Selection criteria|ten criteria]]: six for [[cultural heritage]] (i–vi) and four for [[natural heritage]] (vii–x).&lt;ref name="criteria"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Criteria for Selection |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sites, designated "mixed sites," represent both cultural and natural heritage. In Northern and Central Asia, there are 11 cultural, 8 natural, and no mixed sites. All of the Russian sites (7) are natural and with the exception of [[Saryarka — Steppe and Lakes of Northern Kazakhstan|Sayarka]], all of the sites in Central Asia are cultural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/nominations/ |title=World Heritage List Nominations |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage Committee may also specify that a site is [[World Heritage in Danger|endangered]], citing "conditions which threaten the very characteristics for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List." None of the sites in this region has ever been listed as endangered, but possible danger listing has been considered by UNESCO in a number of cases.&lt;ref name="dangerlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/ |title=World Heritage in Danger |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
The table is sortable by column by clicking on the [[File:Sort both.gif]] at the top of the appropriate column; alphanumerically for the site, area, and year columns; by state party for the location column; and by criteria type for the criteria column. Transborder sites sort at the bottom.

{{GeoGroupTemplate}}
:'''Site'''; named after the World Heritage Committee's official designation&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;
:'''Location'''; at city, regional, or provincial level and geocoordinates
:'''Criteria'''; as defined by the World Heritage Committee&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;
:'''Area'''; in [[hectare]]s and [[acre]]s. If available, the size of the buffer zone has been noted as well. A value of zero implies that no data has been published by UNESCO
:'''Year'''; during which the site was inscribed to the World Heritage List

'''Quest Arabiya''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;عربية&lt;/big&gt; Quest}}), a partnership between [[Discovery Communications]] and the [[Abu Dhabi]]-based [[Image Nation]], is a [[free-to-air]] pan-Arab television channel launched on December 7, 2015 across the [[Middle East and North Africa]] region. It is the region's localized version of the [[Quest (TV channel)|Quest]] channel.

Focusing primarily on factual and reality-based programming, Quest Arabiya broadcasts 24 hours a day, expected to reach an estimated 45 million households across 22 countries. The channel is targeted toward a wide demographic of Arabic-speaking males and females while specifically targeting males 16+ at key times in the schedule.

Content from Discovery's library of factual entertainment shows have been [[voice-over translation|voice-over translated]] into [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Soon afterward, an [[English language|English]] track was launched, allowing viewers to watch the programs in their original language without voice-over translation into Arabic.

The '''Roman Catholic Diocese of Mostar-Duvno''' ({{lang-la|Dioecesis Mandentriensis-Dulminiensis}}) is an ecclesiastical territory or [[diocese]] of the [[Catholic Church]] encompassing [[Herzegovina]]. The diocese, as well as the Franciscan Province, is centred in the city of [[Mostar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was formed on July 5, 1881. However, the [[Diocese of Duvno]] existed long before 1881, and was erected sometime in the 6th century.&lt;ref name=CathHierDuvno&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dmost.html "Diocese of Mostar-Duvno (-Trebinje e Mrkan)"] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''. David M. Cheney. Retrieved October 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCathDuvno&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/most0.htm "Diocese of Mostar-Duvno"] ''GCatholic.org''. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved October 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

The seat of the bishopric is in the Cathedral of Mary the Mother of the Church. The diocese releases two monthly magazines: ''Naša ognjišta'' by the Franciscan Province, and ''Crkva na kamenu'' by the bishopric. 

The diocese covers area of 8.368&amp;nbsp;km sq, with 175.395 Catholic in 66 parishes of the diocese. There are 73 diocesen priests. A number of parishes belongs to the Francisican Province of Herzegovina.

The current bishop of Mostar is Mons. [[Ratko Perić]]. He also serves as administrator of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trebinje-Mrkan|Diocese of Trebinje-Mrkan]]. Trebinje-Mrkan was united with Mostar-Duvno in 1890. 

== History ==

The archive of the Diocesan Ordinariate of Mostar was confiscated by the authorities of [[Communist Yugoslavia]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/37255 Bishop of Mostar Alojzije Mišić (1912-1942) during the Second World War]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The company dates the origin of Study Group from the Embassy language school in [[Hastings]], England, acquired by businessmen Andrew Colin and Duncan Greenland in 1989.  A second language school was opened in [[Hove]] shortly after.  Colin had previously acquired Bellerbys College, a [[Sixth form college|sixth-form college]] for international students. In 1994 the company British Study Group was formed incorporating the two businesses and adding a third shareholder/director John Collyer.

In 1996, 40% of the business was acquired by the [[Daily Mail and General Trust|Daily Mail Group]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmgt.co.uk/mediacentre/newsreleases/19981210/3165/ Daily Mail Group Press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011151737/http://www.dmgt.co.uk/mediacentre/newsreleases/19981210/3165/ |date=2008-10-11 }} Preliminary unaudited consolidated results from Thursday 10 December 1998; mentions Study Group becoming a subsidiary.&lt;/ref&gt; becoming Study Group International and expanding into the US and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmgt.co.uk/mediacentre/newsreleases/19971211/3145/ Another Daily Mail Group press release] Preliminary unaudited consolidated results from Thursday 11 December 1997; mentions expansion into US and Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hothousemedia"&gt;[http://www.hothousemedia.com/ltm/ltmbackissues/feb05web/feb05specreport.htm Special Report: The Evolution of ELC] from Language Travel Magazine. See paragraph headed 'Study Group' for details of acquisition strategy.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, in 1999, the Daily Mail Group became the 100% owner of Study Group, paying an estimated UK£44 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hothousemedia.com/ltm/ltmbackissues/jun07web/jun07specreport.htm Language Travel Magazine] Special Report: Industry Entrepreneurs, June 2007, paragraph titled 'Alternative angles and corporate investment'&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as expanding the UK and Australian operations, Study Group acquired the Center for English Studies (CES) chain of language schools in the USA and Canada,&lt;ref name="hothousemedia" /&gt; adding [[Boston]], [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]], [[San Diego]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]] and [[Vancouver]] to their fold. Embassy became Embassy CES, and then Embassy English.

In 2006 Study Group was acquired by Australian [[private equity]] company Champ, having been sold by Daily Mail Group for A$176.4  million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.champmbo.com/html/portfolio_sgi.html Champ website - portfolio page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720011818/http://www.champmbo.com/html/portfolio_sgi.html |date=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freshfields.com/sector/comms-media/news/Pressrelease.asp?newsitem=938 Press release] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223254/http://www.freshfields.com/sector/comms-media/news/Pressrelease.asp?newsitem=938 |date=2007-09-27 }} from international law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, advisors on the sale.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Brighton school and UK head office moved to purpose-built premises in the [[New England Quarter]], next to [[Brighton station]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embassyenglish.com/schools/england/brighton Embassy website Brighton location] Embassy Brighton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studygroup.com/corporate/english/news_2006/brighton_centre_1.asp Study Group.com corporate website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008184347/http://www.studygroup.com/corporate/english/news_2006/brighton_centre_1.asp |date=2007-10-08 }} New Brighton Study Centre Ahead of Schedule.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new-england-quarter.co.uk/commercial.htm New England Quarter official site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006133545/http://www.new-england-quarter.co.uk/commercial.htm |date=2007-10-06 }} Short description of the Quarter's commercial uses.&lt;/ref&gt; costing an estimated UK£28 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hothousemedia.com/ltm/ltmbackissues/may07web/may07news.htm Language Travel Magazine] New Buildings for British ELT&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2010, Providence Equity Partners took ownership of Study Group for $660 million Australian dollars.

==International Study Centres==
In the [[United Kingdom]], Study Group has entered into agreements with a number of universities, whereby students are taught at an "International Study Centre" by Study Group staff on the university's premises.  These "foundation" courses are designed to prepare students for a regular undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses.  The company website lists such arrangements at the following 'host' universities:
[[Heriot-Watt University|Heriot-Watt]] (Edinburgh), [[Keele University|Keele]], [[Kingston University|Kingston]], [[University of Huddersfield|Huddersfield]], [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]], [[University of Leicester|Leicester]], [[University of Lincoln|Lincoln]], [[Liverpool John Moores University|Liverpool John Moores]], [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] (Glasgow), [[University of Surrey|Surrey]], and the [[University of Sussex|Sussex]]. The group has also had centres at [[University of Wales, Newport]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studygroup.com/isc/wales/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709162606/http://www.studygroup.com/isc/wales/ |archivedate=2014-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Stirling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studygroup.com/isc/stirling/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605215312/http://www.studygroup.com/isc/stirling/ |archivedate=2014-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which have closed.

Under these arrangements, the Study Group programmes are validated by the host university and are marketed alongside the host university's own degree courses. On each university's website, information about Study Group courses are contained on Study Group web pages with the identical appearance to the university's own web pages.

Brighton-based Study Group established one of the first of these arrangements at the nearby [[University of Sussex]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dmgt.co.uk/mediacentre/newsreleases/20051117/3355/&lt;/ref&gt;  These partnerships are attractive to UK universities as they provide a way of increasing numbers of overseas students, whose fee income is important.  Equally, they attract criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=International Study saga continues |url=http://www.ussu.info/files/minisites/1690/2005-6t2%20Badger1.pdf |format=PDF |newspaper=The Badger |date=January 9, 2006 |location=University of Sussex |page=3 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis that students do not expect a British university course to be provided by a commercial company, that the course quality is not accredited within the university system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keeleucu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Special-Newsletter-March-2009.pdf |format=PDF|title=Privatisation at Keele|date=March 2009|publisher=[[University and College Union]]|location=Keele}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that staff transferred to Study Group employment may lose the pay and pension benefits associated with university employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/pdf/l/l/privatecospathwayprovision.pdf |format=PDF|title=International students and pathway provision: The case against the private sector|date=October 2009|publisher=[[University and College Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Study Group has made the same arrangements with a number of United States universities, which have received similar comments. The company website lists such arrangements at the following universities: [[James Madison University|JMU]], [[Long Island University|LIU Post]], [[Roosevelt University|Roosevelt]], [[University of Maine|UMaine]], [[University of Vermont|Vermont]], [[Widener University|Widener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Problem: Foreign Students.

'''USA-83''', also known as '''GPS IIA-5''', '''GPS II-14''' and '''GPS SVN-26''', is an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which forms part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the fifth of nineteen [[GPS Block IIA|Block IIA]] GPS satellites to be launched.

USA-83 was launched at 09:20:01 UTC on 7 July 1992, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D211, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17B]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-83 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2a.htm|title=GPS-2A (Navstar-2A)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August 1992, USA-83 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|19959|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20403|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.92 minutes, and 55 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has PRN 26, and operates in slot 2 of plane F of the GPS constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/navstar.htm|title=Navstar|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite has a mass of {{convert|1816|kg}}. It had a design life of 7.5 years;&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; however, it actually remained in service until January 5, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?Do=gpsShowNanu&amp;num=2015005|title=NOTICE ADVISORY TO NAVSTAR USERS (NANU) 2015005|publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was subsequently disposed of &lt;ref name="GPS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpsworld.com/the-almanac/|title=GPSWorld.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently resides in a disposal orbit approximately 1000&amp;nbsp;km above the operational constellation.&lt;ref name="n2yo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n2yo.com/satellite/?s=22014|title=N2YO.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Upper Battery''' is a former [[artillery battery]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. It was located on the Upper Ridge of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] at a site south of [[Signal Hill Battery]] and faced east over the Mediterranean. It mounted two 32-pdrs. in 1861. On the other side of the hill, three 24-pdrs. were mounted at Lower Battery. The two batteries were used for signalling and drill purposes.&lt;ref name="Hughes369"&gt;{{cite book|title=Strong as the Rock of Gibraltar|last1=Hughes|first1=Quentin|last2=Migos|first2=Athanassios|publisher=Exchange Publications|year=1995|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name "Upper Battery" was later used as a generic term for the three batteries mounting Gibraltar's main counter-bombardment guns, at [[Lord Airey's Battery|Lord Airey's]], [[O'Hara's Battery|O'Hara's]] and [[Spur Battery|Spur Batteries]].&lt;ref name="Hughes369" /&gt;
