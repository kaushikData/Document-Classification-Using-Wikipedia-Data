      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3141">An '''action alert''' is a message that an organization sends to mobilize people, often members of the group and supporters of a specific point of view, calling on them to take action to influence public policy.&lt;ref name="one hour"&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=nN3RMP-BcnkC ''The one-hour activist: the 15 most powerful actions you can take to fight for the issues and candidates you care about''] Christopher Kush, John Wiley and Sons, 2004; {{ISBN|0-7879-7300-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7879-7300-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cyber"&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhRh1LH8tOMC ''Cybercitizen: How to Use Your Computer to Fight for All the Issues You Care about''] Christopher Kush, Macmillan, 2000; {{ISBN|0-312-26305-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-312-26305-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, action alerts are in reference to a timely issue, where prompt action is needed in order to affect upcoming decisions.&lt;ref name="cyber"/&gt;

==Description==
Action alerts are considered a cost-effective and efficient grassroots organizing tool and are employed widely by many advocacy organizations.&lt;ref name="one hour"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cyber"/&gt; A well-designed action alert can be a "powerful way to invite people to participate in the processes of a democracy."&lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=v5H1-i6LHu0C ''The Nonprofit Manager's Resource Directory''], Ronald A. Landskroner, John Wiley and Sons, 2001; {{ISBN|0-471-39242-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-471-39242-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Action alerts may, for instance, ask supporters to:
*Contact their legislator to highlight the issue or argue for/against proposed legislation; or
*Write a [[letter to the editor]] about a specific item in the news.
Action alerts commonly begin by explaining the public policy issue to the recipients, and then tell the reader how they can impact the decision. Action alerts go by many other names. [[Amnesty International]], for instance, refers to them as "Urgent actions".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/pages/ua-index-eng |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403121614/http://web.amnesty.org/pages/ua-index-eng |archivedate=2005-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adoptive cell transfer''' (ACT) is the transfer of [[cell (biology)|cells]] into a patient.&lt;ref name="pmid18779745"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tran KQ, Zhou J, Durflinger KH, Langhan MM, Shelton TE, Wunderlich JR, Robbins PF, Rosenberg SA, Dudley ME | title = Minimally cultured tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes display optimal characteristics for adoptive cell therapy | journal = Journal of Immunotherapy | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 742–51 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18779745 | pmc = 2614999 | doi = 10.1097/CJI.0b013e31818403d5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells may have originated from the patient or from another individual. The cells are most commonly derived from the immune system with the goal of improving immune functionality and characteristics. In autologous [[cancer immunotherapy]], [[T cell]]s are extracted from the patient, genetically modified and cultured ''in vitro'' and returned to the same patient. Comparatively, allogeneic therapies involve cells isolated and expanded from a donor separate from the patient receiving the cells.&lt;ref name="pmid21719916"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marcus A, Eshhar Z | title = Allogeneic adoptive cell transfer therapy as a potent universal treatment for cancer | journal = Oncotarget | volume = 2 | issue = 7 | pages = 525–6 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21719916 | pmc = 3248176 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the 1960s, [[lymphocytes]] were discovered to be the mediators of [[allograft]] rejection in animals. Attempts to use T cells to treat transplanted [[murine]] tumors required cultivating and manipulating T cells in culture. [[Syngeneic]] lymphocytes were transferred from rodents heavily immunized against the tumor to inhibit growth of small established tumors, becoming the first example of ACT.&lt;ref name=rr15/&gt;

Description of T cell growth factor [[interleukin-2]] (IL-2) in 1976 allowed T lymphocytes to be grown ''in vitro'', often without loss of effector functions. High doses of IL-2 could inhibit tumor growth in mice. 1982, studies demonstrated that intravenous immune lymphocytes could treat bulky subcutaneous FBL3 lymphomas. Administration of IL-2 after cell transfer enhanced therapeutic potential.&lt;ref name=rr15/&gt;

In 1985 IL-2 administration produced durable tumor regressions in some patients with [[metastatic melanoma]]. Lymphocytes infiltrating the [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]] of growing, transplantable tumors provided a concentrated source of [[tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes]] (TIL) and could stimulate regression of established lung and liver tumors. In 1986, human TILs from resected melanomas were found to contain cells that could recognize autologous tumors. In 1988 autologous TILs were shown to reduce metastatic melanoma tumors.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt; Tumor-derived TILs are generally mixtures of [[CD8]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;and [[CD4]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;T cells with few major contaminating cells.&lt;ref name=rr15/&gt;

In 1989 [[Zelig Eshhar]] published the first study in which a T cell’s targeting receptor was replaced, and noted that this could be used to direct T cells to attack any kind of cell; this is the essential biotechnology underlying [[Chimeric antigen receptor|CAR-T]] therapy.&lt;ref name="ar15"&gt;{{cite news |title = Biotech’s Coming Cancer Cure|first = Antonio|last = Regalado | name-list-format = vanc |date = June 18, 2015|accessdate = 16 October 2016|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/538441/biotechs-coming-cancer-cure|work = Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responses were often of short duration and faded days after administration. In 2002, lymphodepletion using a nonmyeloablative [[chemotherapy]] regimen administered immediately before TIL transfer increased cancer regression, as well as the persistent oligoclonal repopulation of the host with the transferred lymphocytes. In some patients, the administered antitumor cells represented up to 80% of the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;T cells months after the infusion.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

Initially, melanoma was the only cancer that reproducibly yielded useful TIL cultures. In 2006 administration of normal circulating lymphocytes transduced with a [[retrovirus]] encoding a [[T-cell receptor]] (TCR) that recognized the [[MART-1]] melanoma-melanocyte antigen, mediated tumor regression. In 2010 administration of lymphocytes genetically engineered to express a [[chimeric antigen receptor|chimeric antibody receptor]] (CAR) against B cell antigen [[CD19]] was shown to mediate regression of an advanced [[B cell lymphoma]].&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

In 2009, a woman given T cells engineered to recognize [[colon cancer]] went into respiratory distress and died.

By 2010, doctors had begun experimental treatments for leukemia patients using CD19-targeted T cells with added DNA to stimulate cell division. As of 2015 trials had treated about 350 leukemia and lymphoma patients. Antigen CD19 appears only on [[B cells]], which go awry in lymphoma and leukemia. Loss of B cells can be countered with [[immunoglobulin]].&lt;ref name=ar15/&gt;

Startups including [[Juno Therapeutics]] exploit the combination of aggressive tumors and [[FDA]] willingness to approve potential therapies for such ailments to accelerate approvals for new therapies.&lt;ref name=ar15/&gt;

In checkpoint therapy, antibodies bind to molecules involved in [[T-cell]] regulation to remove inhibitory pathways that block T-cell responses, known as immune checkpoint therapy.&lt;ref name=ar15/&gt;

As of 2015 the technique had expanded to treat [[cervical cancer]], [[lymphoma]], [[leukemia]], [[bile duct cancer]] and [[neuroblastoma]]&lt;ref name="rr15"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenberg SA, Restifo NP | title = Adoptive cell transfer as personalized immunotherapy for human cancer | journal = Science | volume = 348 | issue = 6230 | pages = 62–8 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25838374 | doi = 10.1126/science.aaa4967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in 2016, [[lung cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[sarcoma]] and [[melanoma]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kurzweilai.net/dramatic-remissions-in-blood-cancer-in-immunotherapy-treatment-trial|title = Dramatic remissions in blood cancer in immunotherapy treatment trial|date = March 10, 2016|website = www.kurzweilai.net|access-date = 2016-03-13}}{{MEDRS|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, CD19-specific [[chimeric antigen receptor]] (CAR)-modified T cells were used to treat patients with relapsed and refractory CD19+ [[B cell]] malignancies, including B cell [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (B-ALL) harboring rearrangement of the [[KMT2A|mixed lineage leukemia]] (MLL) gene with CD19 CAR-T cells.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner R, Wu D, Cherian S, Fang M, Hanafi LA, Finney O, Smithers H, Jensen MC, Riddell SR, Maloney DG, Turtle CJ | title = Acquisition of a CD19-negative myeloid phenotype allows immune escape of MLL-rearranged B-ALL from CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy | journal = Blood | volume = 127 | issue = 20 | pages = 2406–10 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26907630 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2015-08-665547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, researchers developed a technique that used cancer cells' RNA to produce T cells and an immune response. They encased the RNA in a negatively charged fatty membrane. ''In vivo'', this electrical charge guided the particles towards the patient's [[Dendritic cell|dendritic immune cells]] that specify immune system targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kranz LM, Diken M, Haas H, Kreiter S, Loquai C, Reuter KC, Meng M, Fritz D, Vascotto F, Hefesha H, Grunwitz C, Vormehr M, Hüsemann Y, Selmi A, Kuhn AN, Buck J, Derhovanessian E, Rae R, Attig S, Diekmann J, Jabulowsky RA, Heesch S, Hassel J, Langguth P, Grabbe S, Huber C, Türeci Ö, Sahin U | title = Systemic RNA delivery to dendritic cells exploits antiviral defence for cancer immunotherapy | journal = Nature | volume = 534 | issue = 7607 | pages = 396–401 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27281205 | doi = 10.1038/nature18300 | laysummary = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/cancer-vaccine-immunotherapy-universal-immune-system-rna-nature-journal-a7060181.html | laydate = June 1, 2016 | laysource = The Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, researchers announced the first use of donor cells (rather than the patients' own cells) to defeat leukemia in two infants for whom other treatments had failed. The cells had four genetic modifications. Two were made using [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]]. One changed the cells so that they did not attack all the cells of another person. Another modification made tumor cells their target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603502/two-infants-treated-with-universal-immune-cells-have-their-cancer-vanish/ | title=Two infants treated with universal immune cells have their cancer vanish|last=Regalado|first=Antonio | name-list-format = vanc |newspaper=MIT Technology Review|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
In melanoma, a resected melanoma specimen is digested into a single-cell suspension or divided into multiple tumor fragments. The result is individually grown in IL-2. Lymphocytes overgrow. They destroy the tumors in the sample within 2 to 3 weeks. They then produce pure cultures of lymphocytes that can be tested for reactivity against other tumors, in coculture assays. Individual cultures are then expanded in the presence of IL-2 and excess irradiated [[Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody|anti-CD3 antibodies]]. The latter targets the epsilon subunit within the human [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] complex of the TCR. 5–6 weeks after resecting the tumor, up to 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; lymphocytes can be obtained.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

Prior to infusion, a lymphodepleting preparative regimen is undergone, typically 60&amp;nbsp;mg/kg [[cyclophosphamide]] for 2 days and 25&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[fludarabine]] administered for 5 days. This substantially increases infused cell persistence and the incidence and duration of clinical responses. Then cells and IL-2 at 720,000 IU/kg to tolerance are infused.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

[[Interleukin-21]] may play an important role in enhancing the efficacy of T cell based ''in vitro'' therapies.

In early trials, preparing engineered T cells cost $75,000 to manufacture cells for each patient.&lt;ref name=ar15/&gt;

[[Interleukin-2]] is normally added to the extracted T cells to boost their effectiveness, but in high doses it can have a toxic effect. The reduced number of injected T cells is accompanied by reduced Il-2, thereby reducing side effects. ''In vitro'' tests on melanoma and kidney cancer models met expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Monette A, Ceccaldi C, Assaad E, Lerouge S, Lapointe R | title = Chitosan thermogels for local expansion and delivery of tumor-specific T lymphocytes towards enhanced cancer immunotherapies | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 75 | issue =  | pages = 237–249 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26513416 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.10.021 | laysummary = http://crchum.chumontreal.qc.ca/en/news-briefs/intelligent-gel-attacks-cancer | laydate = November 19, 2015 | laysource = University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 ''[[Strep-tag|Strep]]''[[Strep-tag|-tag II]] sequences were introduced into synthetic CAR or natural T-cell receptors to serve as a marker for identification, rapid purification, tailoring spacer length for optimal function and selective, antibody-coated, microbead-driven, large-scale expansion. This facilitates [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]] manufacturing of pure populations of engineered T cells and enables ''in vivo'' tracking and retrieval of transferred cells for downstream research applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu L, Sommermeyer D, Cabanov A, Kosasih P, Hill T, Riddell SR | title = Inclusion of Strep-tag II in design of antigen receptors for T-cell immunotherapy | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 430–4 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26900664 | pmc = 4940167 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic engineering ==
Antitumor receptors genetically engineered into normal T cells can be used for therapy. T cells can be redirected by the integration of genes encoding either conventional alpha-beta TCRs or CARs. CARs ([[chimeric antigen receptor|Chimeric Antibody Receptor]]s) were pioneered in the late 1980s and can be constructed by linking the variable regions of the antibody heavy and light chains to intracellular signaling chains such as CD3-zeta, potentially including costimulatory domains encoding [[CD28]] or [[CD137]]. CARs can provide recognition of cell surface components not restricted to [[major histocompatibility complex]]es (MHC). They can be introduced into T cells with high efficiency using [[viral vectors]].&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid26735408/&gt;

==Correlations between T cell differentiation status, cellular persistence, and treatment outcomes==
Improved antitumor responses have been seen in mouse and monkey models using T cells in early differentiation stages (such as naïve or central memory cells). CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells follow a progressive pathway of differentiation from naïve T cells into stem cell memory, central memory, effector memory, and ultimately terminally differentiated effector T cell populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crompton JG, Narayanan M, Cuddapah S, Roychoudhuri R, Ji Y, Yang W, Patel SJ, Sukumar M, Palmer DC, Peng W, Wang E, Marincola FM, Klebanoff CA, Zhao K, Tsang JS, Gattinoni L, Restifo NP | title = Lineage relationship of CD8(+) T cell subsets is revealed by progressive changes in the epigenetic landscape | journal = Cellular &amp; Molecular Immunology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 502–13 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 25914936 | pmc = 4947817 | doi = 10.1038/cmi.2015.32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells paradoxically lose antitumor power as they acquire the ability to lyse target cells and to produce the [[cytokine]] [[interferon-γ]], qualities otherwise thought to be important for antitumor efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gattinoni L, Lugli E, Ji Y, Pos Z, Paulos CM, Quigley MF, Almeida JR, Gostick E, Yu Z, Carpenito C, Wang E, Douek DC, Price DA, June CH, Marincola FM, Roederer M, Restifo NP | title = A human memory T cell subset with stem cell-like properties | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | pages = 1290–7 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21926977 | pmc = 3192229 | doi = 10.1038/nm.2446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gattinoni L, Klebanoff CA, Palmer DC, Wrzesinski C, Kerstann K, Yu Z, Finkelstein SE, Theoret MR, Rosenberg SA, Restifo NP | title = Acquisition of full effector function in vitro paradoxically impairs the in vivo antitumor efficacy of adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 115 | issue = 6 | pages = 1616–26 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15931392 | pmc = 1137001 | doi = 10.1172/JCI24480 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Differentiation state is inversely related to proliferation and persistence. Age is negatively correlated with clinical effectiveness. CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells can exist in a stem cell–like state, capable of clonal proliferation. Human T memory stem cells express a gene program that enables them to proliferate extensively and differentiate into other T cell populations.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells can also promote tumor rejection. CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells enhance CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell function and can directly destroy tumor cells. Evidence suggests that T helper 17 cells can promote sustained antitumor immunity.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muranski P, Borman ZA, Kerkar SP, Klebanoff CA, Ji Y, Sanchez-Perez L, Sukumar M, Reger RN, Yu Z, Kern SJ, Roychoudhuri R, Ferreyra GA, Shen W, Durum SK, Feigenbaum L, Palmer DC, Antony PA, Chan CC, Laurence A, Danner RL, Gattinoni L, Restifo NP | title = Th17 cells are long lived and retain a stem cell-like molecular signature | journal = Immunity | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 972–85 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22177921 | pmc = 3246082 | doi = 10.1016/j.immuni.2011.09.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muranski P, Boni A, Antony PA, Cassard L, Irvine KR, Kaiser A, Paulos CM, Palmer DC, Touloukian CE, Ptak K, Gattinoni L, Wrzesinski C, Hinrichs CS, Kerstann KW, Feigenbaum L, Chan CC, Restifo NP | title = Tumor-specific Th17-polarized cells eradicate large established melanoma | journal = Blood | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 362–73 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18354038 | pmc = 2442746 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2007-11-120998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intrinsic checkpoint blockade==
Other modes of enhancing immuno-therapy include targeting so-called intrinsic immune checkpoint blockades. Many of these intrinsic regulators include molecules with ubiquitin ligase activity, including [[CBLB (gene)|CBLB]]. More recently, [[CISH]], another molecule with ubiquitin ligase activity, was found to be induced by T cell receptor ligation (TCR) and negatively regulate it by targeting the critical signaling intermediate PLC-gamma-1 for degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palmer DC, Guittard GC, Franco Z, Crompton JG, Eil RL, Patel SJ, Ji Y, Van Panhuys N, Klebanoff CA, Sukumar M, Clever D, Chichura A, Roychoudhuri R, Varma R, Wang E, Gattinoni L, Marincola FM, Balagopalan L, Samelson LE, Restifo NP | title = Cish actively silences TCR signaling in CD8+ T cells to maintain tumor tolerance | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 212 | issue = 12 | pages = 2095–113 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26527801 | pmc = 4647263 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20150304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deletion of CISH in effector T cells has been shown to dramatically augment TCR signaling and subsequent effector cytokine release, proliferation and survival. The adoptive transfer of tumor-specific effector T cells knocked out or knocked down for CISH resulted in a significant increase in functional avidity and long-term tumor immunity. Surprisingly there was no changes in activity of Cish's purported target, STAT5. Thus Cish represents a new class of T-cell intrinsic immunologic checkpoints with the potential to radically enhance adoptive immunotherapies for cancer.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Neither tumor bulk nor metastasis site affect the likelihood of achieving a complete cancer regression. Of 34 complete responders in two trials, one recurred. Only one patient with complete regression received more than one treatment. Prior treatment with targeted therapy using [[Braf inhibitor]] [[vemurafenib]] ([[Zelboraf]]) did not affect the likelihood that melanoma patients would experience an objective response. Prior failed immunotherapies did not reduce the odds of objective response.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Cells used in adoptive therapy may be genetically modified using [[recombinant DNA]] technology. One example of this in the case of T cell adoptive therapy is the addition of CARs to redirect the specificity of cytotoxic and helper T cells.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Solid tumors ==
Several ongoing clinical trials of adoptive cell therapies are ongoing in solid tumors, but challenges in the development of such therapies for this type of malignancy include the lack of surface antigens that are not found on essential normal tissues,&lt;ref name=pmid26735408&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klebanoff CA, Rosenberg SA, Restifo NP | title = Prospects for gene-engineered T cell immunotherapy for solid cancers | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–36 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26735408 | doi = 10.1038/nm.4015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; difficult-to-penetrate tumor stroma, and factors in the tumor microenvironment that impede the activity of the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kakarla S, Gottschalk S | title = CAR T cells for solid tumors: armed and ready to go? | journal = Cancer Journal | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–5 | date = 2014-01-01 | pmid = 24667962 | pmc = 4050065 | doi = 10.1097/PPO.0000000000000032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==

=== Toxicity ===
Targeting normal, nonmutated antigenic targets that are expressed on normal tissues, but overexpressed on tumors has led to severe on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Toxicity was encountered in patients who received high-avidity TCRs that recognized either the MART-1 or gp100 melanoma-melanocyte antigens, in mice when targeting melanocyte antigens, in patients with renal cancer using a CAR targeting [[carbonic anhydrase 9]] and in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

Toxicities can also result when previously unknown cross-reactivities are seen that target normal self-proteins expressed in vital organs. Cancer-testes antigen MAGE-A3 is not known to be expressed in any normal tissues. However, targeting an HLA-A*0201–restricted peptide in MAGE-A3 caused severe damage to gray matter in the brain, because this TCR also recognized a different but related epitope that is expressed at low levels in the brain. That CARs are potentially toxic to self-antigens was observed after infusion of CAR T cells specific for ERBB2. Two patients died when treated with an HLA-A1–restricted MAGE-A3–specific TCR whose affinity was enhanced by a site-specific mutagenesis.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

Cancer-testis antigens are a family of intracellular proteins that are expressed during fetal development, but with little expression in normal adult tissues. More than 100 such molecules are epigenetically up-regulated in from 10 to 80% of cancer types. However, they lack high levels of protein expression. Approximately 10% of common cancers appear to express enough protein to be of interest for antitumor T cells. Low levels of some cancer-testes antigens are expressed in normal tissues, with associated toxicities. The NYESO-1 cancer-testes antigen has been targeted via a human TCR transduced into autologous cells. ORs were seen in 5 of 11 patients with metastatic melanoma and 4 of 6 patients with highly refractory [[synovial cell sarcoma]].&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

“Suicide switches” let doctors kill engineered T cells in emergencies which threaten patient survival.&lt;ref name=ar15/&gt;

=== Cytokine release syndrome ===
[[Cytokine release syndrome]] is another side effect and can be a function of therapeutic effectiveness. As the tumor is destroyed, it releases large quantities of cell signaling protein molecules. This effect killed at least seven patients.&lt;ref name="ar15" /&gt;

=== B cells ===
Molecules shared among tumors and nonessential normal organs represent potential ACT targets, despite the related toxicity. For example, the CD19 molecule is expressed on more than 90% of B cell malignancies and on non-plasma B cells at all differentiation stages and has been successfully used to treat patients with [[follicular lymphoma]], [[large-cell lymphoma]]s, [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Toxicity against CD19 results in B cell loss in circulation and in bone marrow that can be overcome by periodic [[immunoglobulin]] infusions.&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

Multiple other B cell antigens are being studied as targets, including [[CD22]], [[CD23]], ROR-1 and the immunoglobulin light-chain [[idiotype]] expressed by the individual cancer. CARs targeting either [[CD33]] or [[CD123]] have been studied as a therapy for patients with [[acute myeloid leukemia]], though the expression of these molecules on normal precursors can lead to prolonged [[myeloablation]]. [[B-cell maturation antigen|BCMA]] is a [[tumor necrosis factor]] receptor family protein expressed on mature B cells and plasma cells and can be targeted on [[multiple myeloma]].&lt;ref name="rr15" /&gt;

'''Architectural technology''', or '''building technology''', is the application of technology to the design of buildings. It is a component of [[architecture]] and [[building engineering]] and is sometimes viewed as a distinct discipline or sub-category. New materials and technologies generated new design challenges and construction methods throughout the evolution of building, especially since the advent of industrialisation in the 19th century. Architectural technology is related to the different elements of a building and their interactions, and is closely aligned with advances in [[building science]].

Architectural technology can be summarised as the "technical design and expertise used in the application and integration of construction technologies in the building design process."&lt;ref&gt; BSc (Architectural Technology) Level 8 - Dublin Institute of Technology&lt;/ref&gt; or as "The ability to analyse, synthesise and evaluate building design factors in order to produce efficient and effective technical design solutions which satisfy performance, production and procurement criteria."&lt;ref&gt;Architectural Technology BSc (Hons), School of the Built and Natural Environment, Ellison Building, Newcastle City Campus&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Many specialists and professionals, consider [[Vitruvius]]'s theories as the foundations of architectural technology. Vitruvius's attempt to classify building types, styles, materials and construction methods&lt;ref&gt;"[[s:Ten Books on Architecture|The Ten Books on Architecture]]", Translated by Morris Hicky Morgan, Ph.D., LL.D., Cambridge, Harvard University Press, London: Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; influenced the creation of many disciplines such as [[civil engineering]], [[structural engineering]], architectural technology and other practices which, now and since the 19th century, form a conceptual framework for architectural design.

In his published research, Stephen Emmitt explains that in our modern society, "The relationship between building technology and design can be traced back to the Enlightenment and the industrial revolution, a period when advances in technology and science were seen as the way forward, and times of solid faith in progress... As technologies multiply in number and complexity the building profession started to fragment".&lt;ref&gt;Extract from: "Architectural Technology: Research and Practice", by Stephen Emmitt, published in May 2013 in the UK by Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-1-118-29206-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice of architectural technology==
Architectural technology is a discipline that spans architecture, building science and engineering. It is practiced by [[architect]]s, [[architectural technologist]]s, [[structural engineer]]s, [[Architectural engineering|architectural / building engineers]] and others who develop the design / concept into a buildable reality. Specialist manufacturers who develop products used to construct buildings, are also involved in the discipline.

[[Paul Nuttall]] director at [[Arup Group|ARUP]] compares the role of the building engineer to the role of the technical architect and architect. The practice of architectural technology cannot be limited to technology itself; it also relates to the space, the building, the light, the environment served and created by the design. The professional in charge of the technical design leads specialist engineers to provide the best technical and engineered solutions for the project.&lt;ref&gt;Breakfast with Arup: Tuesday 11 December 2012, Paul Nuttall, Director, Building Engineering London, Arup In this talk, Paul Nuttall shares his insights on designing buildings in the 21st Century. The video is widely available on youtube and other websites.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, architectural technology is developed, understood and integrated into a building by producing [[architectural drawing]]s and [[Scheduling (production processes)|schedules]]. Computer technology is now used on all but the simplest building types: in the twentieth century the use of [[computer aided design]] (CAD) became mainstream, allowing for highly accurate drawings that can be shared electronically, so that for example the architectural plans can be used as the basis for designing electrical and air handling services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ciat.org.uk/about-us/what-is-a-chartered-architectural-technologist.html What is a Chartered Architectural Technologist ?]&lt;/ref&gt; As the design develops, that information can be shared with the whole [[design team]]. That process is currently taken to a logical conclusion with the widespread use of [[Building Information Modeling]] (BIM), which uses a [[3D modeling|three dimensional model]] of the building, created with input from all the disciplines to build up an integrated design.

Architectural technology is informed by both practical constraints, and [[Building code|building regulations]], as well as standards relating to safety, environmental performance, fire resistance, etc.

==Building materials==
Until the twentieth century, the materials used for building were limited to brick, stone, timber and steel to form structures, slate and tiles for roof coverings, lead and sometimes copper for waterproofing details and decorative roofing effects. The Romans used concrete, but it was virtually unknown as a building material until the invention of reinforced concrete in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blconcrete.htm The History of Concrete and Cement]. Inventors.about.com (2012-04-09). Retrieved on 2013-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern construction is much more complex, with walls, floors and roofs all built up from many elements to include structure, insulation and waterproofing often as separate layers or elements.

The task aims to test the quantity of objects that can be held in working memory while preventing participants from using [[mnemonics]] or other memory techniques separate from the working memory to increase recall capacity.  In the experiment, participants view a sequence of three-letter constructs called trigrams, and are asked to perform simple algebraic computations such as counting backwards by 3s from 999 between each trigram.&lt;ref name=MP /&gt; A trigram consists of 3 [[morpheme|non-morphemic]] letters, the importance of which is that each letter represents a different independent object to be stored in working memory; therefore, trigrams avoid letter combinations that depict words or common acronyms. The algebraic computations are administered between trigrams to assure the participant isn't using mnemonic strategies to [[Chunking (psychology)|chunk]] the letters into a single object.  Variants of the Brown–Peterson task are still used today, all with the same fundamental concept of administering items for the participant to remember whilst preventing the usage of additional cognitive resources to augment working memory.&lt;ref name="pubmed"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Procedure ==

The Brown–Peterson task refers to two studies published in the late 1950s that used similar procedures, one in 1958 by John Brown&lt;ref name=JB /&gt; and a second in 1959 by Lloyd and Margaret Peterson.&lt;ref name=MP /&gt;

The first experiment involved 24 psychology students at [[Indiana University]] at the time. The examiner proceeded by spelling a random three-letter nonsense syllable and then enunciating immediately afterwards a random three-digit number. The subject would then count backwards by some assigned number, either three or four, from the enunciated number.

After a set interval, a light signal was flashed to prompt the subject to cease verbally counting and to recall the random, three-letter nonsense syllable. The time interval between the enunciation by the examiner of the nonsense syllable (exposure to the syllable) and the signal prompt to the participant was known as the recall interval; the time interval between the signal prompt and the enunciation of the third letter by the participant was known as a latency.
In order to maintain [[reproducibility]] of results, each participant was tested eight times using each recall interval, which were 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 seconds. In addition, each nonsense syllable appeared an equal amount of times; the trials were split evenly in terms of counting by either three or four. No successive items contained the same letters, and the time between signal for recall and the next trial was always 15 seconds. In addition, the examiner and participant were instructed to enunciate in rhythm with a 120 BPM metronome, such that two letters or numbers were spoken per second.

The second experiment involved 48 psychology students from Indiana University. The exact procedure from the first experiment was followed for 24 of the students, but the other 24 were asked to repeat the stimulus (i.e., the nonsense syllable) aloud until the examiner stated the three-digit number. Therefore, the only difference between the two experiments was that there was a variable gap between the examiner's enunciation of the stimulus and the number, during which maintenance rehearsal took place. The inspiration behind this experiment was Brown's disbelief that repetition would strengthen the 'memory trace. The purpose of the second experiment was basically to prove or disprove this notion. However, the analysis of the study concluded that forgetting was found to progress at differential rates dependent upon the amount of rehearsal that took place'.&lt;ref name=MP /&gt;

== Interference ==
{{main article|Interference theory}}
There are two types of interference:

'''Retroactive interference''': This type of interference occurs when new information disrupts the recall of old information.

'''Proactive interference''': This type of interference occurs when old information disrupts the recall of new information.

Proactive interference affects participant performance in the Brown–Peterson task. The first time the students participate in the task, they show little loss of information.&lt;ref name=Revlin&gt;

| isbn = 978-0-7167-5667-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after multiple trials, the task becomes increasingly challenging when letters from the early trials are confused with letters in the current trial. 
Fortunately, proactive interference can be hindered if the information to be remembered is changed to a different type of information. For example, in the Brown–Peterson task there appeared to be little proactive interference when the participants switched from recalling letters to recalling numbers.&lt;ref name=Revlin /&gt;

== Rehearsal ==

A key aspect of the Brown–Peterson task is the fact that it blocks [[Memory rehearsal|rehearsal]], which is used to better recall items in [[short-term memory]]. Rehearsal is the concept of directing attention to material that was just learned. This way, it can lengthen the duration of one's short-term memory capacity. In order to accurately calculate the duration of short-term memory using the Brown–Peterson task, such a method must be blocked so as not to falsely increase an unaltered duration. There are two different types of rehearsal:

'''Maintenance rehearsal''': This method of rehearsal uses repetition of the items in memory. It is essentially "saying something repeatedly in order to keep it in mind".&lt;ref name=Revlin /&gt; An example could be attempting to memorize a shopping list while out shopping for groceries. Instead of remembering to take the list out to the store, the shopper could leave it at home and proceed to repeat each word. As useful as this type of rehearsal may seem, it does not guarantee the ability to recall what was memorized after it is no longer rehearsed

'''Elaborative rehearsal''': This is type of rehearsal is also known as creative rehearsal. Elaborative rehearsal uses creativity to increase capacity of short-term memory and accurately recall items. Creating associations and connections between something significant to the person memorizing and the item(s) to be memorized is one example of elaborative rehearsal. Another example is the use of mnemonic devices, which are a creative way to mentally arrange the items to be memorized.

Three key words in rehearsal are Association, Location, and Imagination. Association is an important factor in rehearsal, as it is the part of elaborative rehearsal where people make connections with the items and things significant to them. This helps increase capacity of short-term memory as they are recalling items with the help of something meaningful to them. Location is another factor, as incorporating location into what they are trying to memorize may be another association to a significant location in particular, thus making the item much easier to recall. Finally, imagination is essentially the creativity of elaborative rehearsal. It combines creativity with the items to recall in such a way that makes them easiest to recall.

'''Centre for Mathematical Sciences''' ('''CMS'''), with [[campus]]es at [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and [[Palai|Pala]] in [[Kerala]], [[India]], is a research level  [[institution]] devoted to [[mathematics]] and other related disciplines like [[statistics]], [[theoretical physics]], [[computer science|computer]] and [[information science]]s. 
The Centre was incorporated in 1977 as a non-profit scientific research and training centre  under the [[Travancore]]-[[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]] Literary, Scientific and Charitable Societies Registration Act XII of 1955. The driving force behind the establishment of the Centre was Prof. Aleyamma George, who had been  Professor and Head of the Department of Statistics of [[University of Kerala]]. Since 2006, the Centre is a [[Department of Science and Technology (India)]] (DST), [[Government of India]], [[New Delhi]] Centre for Mathematical Sciences and is  fully financed by DST, New Delhi.&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comprehensive overview on management, faculty, research guides, and research fellows of CMS|url=http://www.cmsintl.org/CMS2010.pdf|accessdate=29 May 2010}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre is headed by a Chairman, a position currently held by Dr. A Sukumaran Nair, a former [[Vice-Chancellor]] of [[Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala|Mahatma Gandhi University]], [[Kottayam]], and a Director a position now held by [[A. M. Mathai|Dr. A.M. Mathai]], Emeritus Professor of Mathematics and Statistics, McGill University, Canada. The activities of the Thiruvananthapuram Campus are coordinated by [[K. S. S.

The Centre has started doing good work in its early years itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapur|first=J.N.|title=Development of mathematical sciences in India during the twentieth century|journal=Indian Journal of History of Science|year=1992|volume=27|issue=4|pages=390&amp;ndash;409|url=http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b5a_389.pdf|accessdate=29 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316083639/http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b5a_389.pdf#|archive-date=16 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}} (see p.402, item 5)&lt;/ref&gt; At present, several research teams are operating in the Centre like [[Astrophysics]] Research Group, [[Fractional calculus|Fractional Calculus]] Research Group, [[Special functions|Special Functions]] Research Group, Statistical Distribution Theory Research Group, [[Geometric probability|Geometrical Probability]] Research Group, [[Stochastic Process]] Research Group, and [[Discrete Mathematics]] in [[Chemistry]] Research Group.&lt;ref name="Overview"/&gt;

==History==

Centre for Mathematical Sciences was established in 1977  in [[Trivandrum]], [[Kerala]], [[India]]. In 2002, the  [[Palai|Pala]] [[Campus]] of the Centre was established in a one-floor finished building donated by the [[Diocese]] of [[Palai]] in [[Kerala]], [[India]]. In 2006, Hill Area Campus of the Centre was established. The office, the library and most of the facilities are at the Pala Campus. Starting from 1985, Professor Dr. A.M. Mathai of [[McGill University]], [[Canada]] is the Director of the Centre. In 2006-2007 the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)]] (DST) gave a development grant to the Centre. Starting from December 2006, the Centre is being developed as a DST Centre for Mathematical Sciences. DST has similar centres at three other locations in India.&lt;ref name="Haubold"&gt;{{cite web|last=Haubold|first=Hans J. |title=Centre for Mathematical Sciences India (CMS)|url=http://bssihy.kasi.re.kr/unbssw_se1.aspx|publisher=BSS &amp; IHY Workshops|accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1977 to 2006, the activities  at the Centre were carried out by a group of researchers in Kerala, mostly retired professors, through voluntary service. Starting from 2007, DST created full-time salaried positions of three Assistant Professors, one Full Professor and one Liaison Officer. They are at Pala Campus. DST approved up to 15 junior research fellows (JRF) and one senior research fellow (SRF). They are the current PhD students at the Pala Campus. They would receive their PhD degrees from [[Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala|Mahatma Gandhi University]], [[Kottayam]], [[Kerala]].&lt;ref name="Haubold"/&gt;

'''Challenger Center for Space Science Education''' is a [[United States]] 501(c)(3) [[non-profit organization]] headquartered in [[Washington, DC]]. It was founded in 1986 by the families of the astronauts who died in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] on January 28, 1986.

The organization offers dynamic, hands-on exploration and discovery opportunities to students around the world. These programs equip students with the knowledge, confidence, and skills that will help better our national social and economic well-being.

Challenger Learning Centers give students the chance to become astronauts and engineers and solve real-world problems as they share the thrill of discovery on missions through the Solar System. Using space simulation and role-playing strategies, students bring their classroom studies to life and cultivate the skills needed for future success.

Although classical styles of architecture can vary greatly, they can in general all be said to draw on a common "vocabulary" of decorative and constructive elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fleming| first1 = John| last2 = Honour| first2 = Hugh| last3 = Pevsner| first3 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = Dictionary of architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd | series = | volume = | edition = 3| year = 1986| location = | page = 76| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-14-051013-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Watkin| first1 = David| authorlink = | title = A History of Western Architecture | publisher = Watson-Guptill Publications | series = | volume = | edition = 4| year = 2005| location = | pages = 6–8| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8230-2277-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Summerson| first1 = John| authorlink = | title = The Classical Language of Architecture | publisher = Thames and Hudson Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1980| location = | pages = 7–8| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-500-20177-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In much of the Western world, different classical architectural styles have dominated the history of architecture from the Renaissance until the second world war, though it continues to inform many architects to this day.

The term "classical architecture" also applies to any mode of architecture that has evolved to a highly refined state, such as classical Chinese architecture, or classical Mayan architecture.  It can also refer to any architecture that employs classical aesthetic philosophy. The term might be used differently from "traditional" or "[[vernacular architecture]]", although it can share underlying axioms with it.

For contemporary buildings following authentic classical principles, the term [[New Classical Architecture]] may be used.

==History==

===Origins===
Classical architecture is derived from the architecture of ancient Greece and ancient Rome. With the [[Deposition of Romulus Augustulus|collapse of the western part of the Roman empire]], the architectural traditions of the Roman empire ceased to be practised in large parts of western Europe. In the [[Byzantine Empire]], the ancient ways of building lived on but relatively soon  developed into a distinct [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Adam| first1 = Robert| authorlink = | title = Classical Architecture | publisher = Viking| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1992| location = | pages = 16| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first conscious efforts to bring back the disused language of form of classical antiquity into Western architecture can be traced to the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian Renaissance]] of the late 8th and 9th centuries. The gatehouse of [[Lorsch Abbey]] (c. 800), in present-day [[Germany]] thus displays a system of alternating attached columns and arches which could be an almost direct paraphrase of e.g., that of the [[Colosseum]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pevsner| first1 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = An Outline of European Architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = 7| year = 1964| location = | pages = 45–47| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine architecture]], just as [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and even to some extent [[Gothic architecture]] (with which classical architecture is often posed), can also incorporate classical elements and details but do not to the same degree reflect a conscious effort to draw upon the architectural traditions of antiquity; for example, they do not observe the idea of [[Classical order|a systematic order of proportions for pillars]]. In general, therefore, they are not considered classical archerchitectural styles in a strict sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Summerson| first1 = John| authorlink = | title = The Classical Language of Architecture | publisher = Thames and Hudson Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1980| location = | pages = 7–8| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-500-20177-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Italian renaissance and with the demise of Gothic style, major efforts were made by architects such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] to revive the language of architecture of first and foremost ancient Rome. This was done in part through the study of the ancient Roman architectural treatise ''[[De architectura]]'' by [[Vitruvius]], and to some extent by studying the actual remains of ancient Roman buildings in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Summerson| first1 = John| authorlink = | title = The Classical Language of Architecture | publisher = Thames and Hudson Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1980| location = | pages = 7–8| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-500-20177-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the classical architecture of the Renaissance from the outset represents a highly specific interpretation of the classical ideas. In a building like the ''[[Ospedale degli Innocenti]]'' in [[Florence]] by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], one of the very earliest Renaissance buildings (built 1419&amp;ndash;45), the treatment of the columns for example has no direct antecedent in ancient Roman architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pevsner| first1 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = An Outline of European Architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = 7| year = 1964| location = | pages = 177–178| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period, the study of ancient architecture developed into the architectural theory of classical architecture; somewhat over-simplified, one could say that classical architecture in its variety of forms ever since have been interpretations and elaborations of the architectural rules set down during antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Evers| first1 = Bernd| last2 = Thoenes| first2 = Christof| authorlink = | title = Architectural Theory from the Renaissance to the Present | publisher = Taschen| series = | volume = 1| edition = | year = 2011| location = | pages = 6–19| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-3-8365-3198-6 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the styles originating in post-[[renaissance]] [[Europe]] can be described as classical architecture. This broad use of the term is employed by Sir [[John Summerson]] in ''[[The Classical Language of Architecture]]''. The elements of classical architecture have been applied in radically different architectural contexts than those for which they were developed, however. For example, [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] or [[Rococo architecture#Architecture|Rococo architecture]] are styles which, although classical at root, display an architectural language very much in their own right. During these periods, architectural theory still referred to classical ideas but rather less sincerely than during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fleming| first1 = John| last2 = Honour| first2 = Hugh| last3 = Pevsner| first3 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = Dictionary of architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd | series = | volume = | edition = 3| year = 1986| location = | page = 76| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-14-051013-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reaction to late baroque and rococo forms, architectural theorists from circa 1750 through what became known as [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] again consciously and earnestly attempted to emulate antiquity, supported by recent developments in [[Classical archaeology]] and a desire for an architecture based on clear rules and rationality. [[Claude Perrault]], [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]] and [[Carlo Lodoli]] were among the first theorists of neoclassicism, while [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]], [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]], [[Friedrich Gilly]] and [[John Soane]] were among the more radical and influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fleming| first1 = John| last2 = Honour| first2 = Hugh| last3 = Pevsner| first3 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = Dictionary of architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd | series = | volume = | edition = 3| year = 1986| location = | page = 76| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-14-051013-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoclassical architecture held a particularly strong position on the architectural scene c. 1750&amp;ndash;1850. The competing [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic style]] however rose to popularity during the early 1800s, and the later part the 19th century was characterised by a variety of styles, some of them only slightly or not at all related to classicism (such as [[Art Nouveau]]), and [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclecticism]]. Although classical architecture continued to play an important role and for periods of time at least locally dominated the architectural scene, as exemplified by the "[[Nordic Classicism]]" during the 1920s, classical architecture in its stricter form never regained its former dominance. With the advent of [[Modern architecture|Modernism]] during the early 20th century, classical architecture arguably almost completely ceased to be practised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Summerson| first1 = John| authorlink = | title = The Classical Language of Architecture | publisher = Thames and Hudson Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1980| location = | page = 114| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-500-20177-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glyptothek, Königsplatz, Múnich, Alemania02.JPG|thumb|right|alt=The Glyptothek in Munich, designed by architect Leon von Klenze and built 1816&amp;ndash;30, an example of Neoclassical architecture.|The [[Glyptothek]] in [[Munich]], designed by [[Leo von Klenze]] and built 1816&amp;ndash;30, an example of [[Neoclassical architecture]].]]

==Scope==
As noted above, classical styles of architecture dominated Western architecture for a very long time, roughly from the Renaissance until the advent of [[Modern architecture|Modernism]]. That is to say, that classical antiquity at least in theory was considered the prime source of inspiration for architectural endeavours in the West for much of [[Modern history]]. Even so, because of liberal, personal or theoretically diverse interpretations of the antique heritage, classicism covers a broad range of styles, some even so to speak cross-referencing, like [[Palladian architecture#Neo-Palladian|Neo-Palladian architecture]], which draws its inspiration from the works of Italian Renaissance architect [[Andrea Palladio]] &amp;mdash; who himself drew inspiration from ancient Roman architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fleming| first1 = John| last2 = Honour| first2 = Hugh| last3 = Pevsner| first3 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = Dictionary of architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd | series = | volume = | edition = 3| year = 1986| location = | page = 234| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-14-051013-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it can even be argued (as noted above) that styles of architecture not typically considered classical, like Gothic, can be said to contain classical elements. Therefore, a simple delineation of the scope of classical architecture is difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Summerson| first1 = John| authorlink = | title = The Classical Language of Architecture | publisher = Thames and Hudson Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1980| location = | pages = 7–8| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-500-20177-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more or less defining characteristic can still be said to be a reference to ancient Greek or Roman architecture, and the architectural rules or theories that derived from that architecture.

==Petrification==
In the grammar of architecture, the word ''petrification'' is often used when discussing the development of sacred structures, such as temples, mainly with reference to developments in the Greek world.  During the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and early [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods (about the 6th and early 5th centuries BC), the architectural forms of the earliest temples had solidified and the [[Doric order|Doric]] emerged as the predominant element.  A widely accepted theory in classical studies is that the earliest temple structures were of wood and the great forms, or elements of architectural style, were codified and rather permanent by the time we see the Archaic emergent and established.  It was during this period, at different times and places in the Greek world, that the use of dressed and polished stone replaced the wood in these early temples, but the forms and shapes of the old wooden styles were retained, just as if the wooden structures had turned to stone, thus the designation ''petrification''&lt;ref&gt;Gagarin, Michael. The Oxford encyclopedia of ancient Greece and Rome. Vol. 1. Oxford [u.a.: Oxford Univ. Press, 2010. 210. {{ISBN|0195170725}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes "petrified carpentry"&lt;ref&gt;Watkin, David. A history of Western architecture. 4th ed. London: Laurence King, 2005. 25. {{ISBN|1856694593}}&lt;/ref&gt; for this process.

This careful preservation of the primitive wooden appearance in the stone fabric of the newer buildings was scrupulously observed and this suggests that it may have been dictated by religion rather than aesthetics, although the exact reasons are now lost in the mists of antiquity. And not everyone within the great reach of Mediterranean civilization made this transition.  The [[Etruscans]] in Italy were, from their earliest period, greatly influenced by their contact with Greek culture and religion, but they retained their wooden temples (with some exceptions) until their culture was completely absorbed into the Roman world, with the great wooden [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter]] on the Capitol in Rome itself being a good example.  Nor was it the lack of knowledge of stone working on their part that prevented them from making the transition from timber to dressed stone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5080">'''Confidence weighting (CW)''' is concerned with measuring two variables: (1) what a respondent believes is a correct answer to a question and (2) what degree of certainty the respondent has toward the correctness of this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ebel|first=R.

''Confidence weighting'' when applied to a specific answer selection for a particular test or exam question is referred to in the literature from [[cognitive psychology]] as item-specific confidence, a term typically used by researchers who investigate metamemory or [[metacognition]], comprehension monitoring, or feeling-of-knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lundeberg|first=M.|author2=Fox, P.

'''Control engineering''' or '''control systems engineering'''  is an [[engineering]] discipline that applies [[automatic control]] theory to design systems with desired behaviors in [[Control theory|control]] environments.&lt;ref name="Case Western Reserve University"&gt;{{cite web|title=Systems &amp; Control Engineering FAQ {{!}} Electrical Engineering and Computer Science|url=https://engineering.case.edu/eecs/node/213|website=engineering.case.edu|publisher=Case Western Reserve University|accessdate=27 June 2017|language=en|date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline of controls overlaps and is usually taught along with [[electrical engineering]] at many institutions around the world.&lt;ref name="Case Western Reserve University"/&gt;

The practice uses [[sensors]] and detectors to measure the output performance of the process being controlled; these measurements are used to provide corrective [[feedback]] helping to achieve the desired performance. Systems designed to perform without requiring human input are called [[automatic control]] systems (such as [[cruise control]] for regulating the speed of a car). [[Multi-disciplinary]] in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by [[mathematical model]]ing of a diverse range of [[system]]s.

==Overview==
Modern day control engineering is a relatively new field of study that gained significant attention during the 20th century with the advancement of technology. It can be broadly defined or classified as practical application of [[control theory]]. Control engineering has an essential role in a wide range of control systems, from simple household washing machines to high-performance [[F-16]] fighter aircraft. It seeks to understand physical systems, using mathematical modelling, in terms of inputs, outputs and various components with different behaviors; use control systems design tools to develop [[Controller (control theory)|controller]]s for those systems; and implement controllers in physical systems employing available technology. A [[control system|system]] can be [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[fluid]], [[chemical]], [[finance|financial]] or [[biology|biological]], and the mathematical modelling, analysis and controller design uses [[control theory]] in one or many of the [[Time domain|time]], [[frequency domain|frequency]] and [[S domain|complex-s]] domains, depending on the nature of the design problem.

== History ==
[[Image:Colonne distillazione.jpg|thumb| Control of [[fractionating column]]s is one of the more challenging applications]]Automatic control systems were first developed over two thousand years ago. The first feedback control device on record is thought to be the ancient [[Ktesibios]]'s [[water clock]] in [[Alexandria]], Egypt around the third century B.C.E. It kept time by regulating the water level in a vessel and, therefore, the water flow from that vessel. This certainly was a successful device as water clocks of similar design were still being made in Baghdad when the Mongols [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|captured]] the city in 1258 A.D. A variety of automatic devices have been used over the centuries to accomplish useful tasks or simply to just entertain. The latter includes the automata, popular in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, featuring dancing figures that would repeat the same task over and over again; these automata are examples of open-loop control. Milestones among feedback, or "closed-loop" automatic control devices, include the temperature regulator of a furnace attributed to [[Cornelis Drebbel|Drebbel]], circa 1620, and the centrifugal flyball governor used for regulating the speed of steam engines by James Watt in 1788.

In his 1868 paper "On Governors", [[James Clerk Maxwell]] was able to explain instabilities exhibited by the flyball governor using differential equations to describe the control system. This demonstrated the importance and usefulness of mathematical models and methods in understanding complex phenomena, and it signalled the beginning of mathematical control and systems theory. Elements of control theory had appeared earlier but not as dramatically and convincingly as in Maxwell's analysis.

Control theory made significant strides over the next century. New mathematical techniques, as well as advancements in electronic and computer technologies, made it possible to control significantly more complex dynamical systems than the original flyball governor could stabilize. New mathematical techniques included developments in optimal control in the 1950s and 1960s followed by progress in stochastic, robust, adaptive, nonlinear, and azid-based control methods in the 1970s and 1980s. Applications of control methodology have helped to make possible space travel and communication satellites, safer and more efficient aircraft, cleaner automobile engines, and cleaner and more efficient chemical processes.

Before it emerged as a unique discipline, control engineering was practiced as a part of [[mechanical engineering]] and [[control theory]] was studied as a part of [[electrical engineering]] since [[electrical circuits]] can often be easily described using control theory techniques. In the very first control relationships, a current output was represented by a voltage control input. However, not having adequate technology to implement electrical control systems, designers were left with the option of less efficient and slow responding mechanical systems. A very effective mechanical controller that is still widely used in some hydro plants is the [[Centrifugal governor|governor]]. Later on, previous to modern [[power electronics]], process control systems for industrial applications were devised by mechanical engineers using [[pneumatics|pneumatic]] and [[Hydraulic system|hydraulic]] control devices, many of which are still in use today.

== Control theory ==
{{main|Control theory}}

There are two major divisions in control theory, namely, classical and modern, which have direct implications for the control engineering applications. The scope of classical control theory is limited to [[Single-input single-output system|single-input and single-output]] (SISO) system design, except when analyzing for disturbance rejection using a second input. The system analysis is carried out in the time domain using [[differential equations]], in the complex-s domain with the [[Laplace transform]], or in the frequency domain by transforming from the complex-s domain. Many systems may be assumed to have a second order and single variable system response in the time domain. A controller designed using classical theory often requires on-site tuning due to incorrect design approximations. Yet, due to the easier physical implementation of classical controller designs as compared to systems designed using modern control theory, these controllers are preferred in most industrial applications. The most common controllers designed using classical control theory are [[PID controller]]s. A less common implementation may include either or both a Lead or Lag filter. The ultimate end goal is to meet requirements typically provided in the time-domain called the step response, or at times in the frequency domain called the open-loop response. The step response characteristics applied in a specification are typically percent overshoot, settling time, etc. The open-loop response characteristics applied in a specification are typically Gain and Phase margin and bandwidth. These characteristics may be evaluated through simulation including a dynamic model of the system under control coupled with the compensation model.

In contrast, modern control theory is carried out in the [[state space (controls)|state space]], and can deal with [[Multiple-input multiple-output system|multiple-input and multiple-output]] (MIMO) systems. This overcomes the limitations of classical control theory in more sophisticated design problems, such as fighter aircraft control, with the limitation that no frequency domain analysis is possible. In modern design, a system is represented to the greatest advantage as a set of decoupled first order [[differential equation]]s defined using [[state variables]]. [[Nonlinear control|Nonlinear]], [[multivariable control|multivariable]], [[adaptive control|adaptive]] and [[robust control]] theories come under this division. Matrix methods are significantly limited for MIMO systems where linear independence cannot be assured in the relationship between inputs and outputs. Being fairly new, modern control theory has many areas yet to be explored. Scholars like [[Rudolf E. Kalman]] and [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] are well-known among the people who have shaped modern control theory.

== Control systems ==
Control engineering is the engineering [[discipline]] that focuses on the [[mathematical model|modeling]] of a diverse range of [[dynamic systems]] (e.g. [[mechanics|mechanical]] [[system]]s) and the design of [[controller (control theory)|controller]]s that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner.  Although such controllers need not be electrical, many are and hence control engineering is often viewed as a subfield of electrical engineering.  However, the falling price of microprocessors is making the actual implementation of a control system essentially trivial{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.  As a result, focus is shifting back to the mechanical and process engineering discipline, as intimate knowledge of the physical system being controlled is often desired.

[[Electrical circuit]]s, [[digital signal processor]]s and [[microcontroller]]s can all be used to implement [[control system]]s. Control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airliners]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile]]s. 

In most cases, control engineers utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. This is often accomplished using a [[PID controller]] system. For example, in an [[automobile]] with [[cruise control]] the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system, which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|motor's]] [[torque]] accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback. In practically all such systems [[stability theory|stability]] is important and control theory can help ensure stability is achieved.

Although feedback is an important aspect of control engineering, control engineers may also work on the control of systems without feedback. This is known as [[open loop control]]. A classic example of [[open loop control]] is a [[washing machine]] that runs through a pre-determined cycle without the use of [[sensor]]s.

== Control engineering education ==
At many universities around the world, control engineering courses are taught primarily in [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]], but some courses can be instructed in [[mechatronics engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], and [[aerospace engineering]]. In others, control engineering is connected to [[computer science]], as most control techniques today are implemented through computers, often as [[embedded systems]] (as in the automotive field). The field of control within [[chemical engineering]] is often known as [[process control]]. It deals primarily with the control of variables in a chemical process in a plant. It is taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of any chemical engineering program and employs many of the same principles in control engineering. Other engineering disciplines also overlap with control engineering as it can be applied to any system for which a suitable model can be derived. However, specialised control engineering departments do exist, for example, the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at the University of Sheffield &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse|website=|title=ACSE - The University of Sheffield|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Systems Engineering at the United States Naval Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.edu/WSE/|website=USNA Weapons and Systems Engineering|accessdate=19 November 2014|title=WRC Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control engineering has diversified applications that include science, finance management, and even human behavior.  Students of control engineering may start with a linear control system course dealing with the time and complex-s domain, which requires a thorough background in elementary mathematics and [[Laplace transform]], called classical control theory.  In linear control, the student does frequency and time domain analysis.  [[Digital control]] and [[nonlinear control]] courses require [[Z transform]]ation and algebra respectively, and could be said to complete a basic control education.

== Recent advancement ==
Originally, control engineering was all about continuous systems. Development of computer control tools posed a requirement of discrete control system engineering because the communications between the computer-based digital controller and the physical system are governed by a [[computer clock]]. The equivalent to [[Laplace transform]] in the discrete domain is the [[Z-transform]]. Today, many of the control systems are computer controlled and they consist of both digital and analog components.

Therefore, at the design stage either digital components are mapped into the continuous domain and the design is carried out in the continuous domain, or analog components are mapped into discrete domain and design is carried out there. The first of these two methods is more commonly encountered in practice because many industrial systems have many continuous systems components, including mechanical, fluid, biological and analog electrical components, with a few digital controllers.

Similarly, the design technique has progressed from paper-and-ruler based manual design to [[computer-aided design]] and now to [[computer-automated design]] or CAutoD which has been made possible by [[evolutionary computation]]. CAutoD can be applied not just to tuning a predefined control scheme, but also to controller structure optimisation, system identification and invention of novel control systems, based purely upon a performance requirement, independent of any specific control scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, K.C. and Li, Y. (2001) Performance-based control system design automation via evolutionary computing. Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 14 (4). pp. 473-486. {{ISSN|0952-1976}}, http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3807/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, Y., et al. (2004).

International Journal of Automation and Computing, 1(1). pp.76-88. {{ISSN|1751-8520}}, http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3818/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Resilient control systems]] extend the traditional focus of addressing only planned disturbances to frameworks and attempt to address multiple types of unexpected disturbance; in particular, adapting and transforming behaviors of the control system in response to malicious actors, abnormal failure modes, undesirable human action, etc.&lt;ref&gt;C.

Because memory is not just an individual, private experience but is also part of the collective domain, '''cultural memory''' has become a topic in both [[historiography]] ([[Pierre Nora]], Richard Terdiman) and [[cultural studies]] (e.g., [[Susan Stewart (poet)|Susan Stewart]]). These emphasize cultural memory’s process (historiography) and its implications and objects (cultural studies), respectively. Two schools of thought have emerged, one articulates that the present shapes our understanding of the past. The other assumes that the past has an influence on our present behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Barry. 1991. "Social Change and Collective Memory: The Democratization of George Washington." American Sociological Review 56: 221-236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B. (2010). 'Culture and Collective Memory: Two Comparative Perspectives'. In. Hall, J. R.; Grindstaff, L. and Lo, M-C. ''Handbook of Cultural Sociology''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiographical approach==

===Time===

Crucial in understanding cultural memory as a phenomenon is the distinction between memory and [[history]].  This distinction was put forward by [[Pierre Nora]], who pinpointed a niche in-between history and memory.

Scholars disagree as to when to locate the moment representation 'took over'. Nora points to the formation of European [[nation state]]s. For [[Richard Terdiman]], the [[French revolution]] is the breaking point: the change of a political system, together with the emergence of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]], made life more complex than ever before. This not only resulted in an increasing difficulty for people to understand the new society in which they were living, but also, as this break was so radical, people had trouble relating to the past ''before'' the revolution. In this situation, people no longer had an implicit understanding of their past. In order to understand the past, it had to be represented through history. As people realized that history was only one version of the past, they became more and more concerned with their own [[cultural heritage]] (in French called ''patrimoine'') which helped them shape a collective and [[national identity]]. In search for an identity to bind a country or people together, governments have constructed collective memories in the form of commemorations which should bring and keep together minority groups and individuals with conflicting agendas. What becomes clear is that the obsession with memory coincides with the fear of [[forgetting]] and the aim for [[Authentication|authenticity]].

However, more recently questions have arisen whether there ever was a time in which 'pure', non-representational memory existed – as Nora in particular put forward. Scholars like [[Tony Bennett (sociologist)|Tony Bennett]] rightly point out that representation is a crucial precondition for human perception in general: pure, organic and objective memories can never be witnessed as such.

===Space===

It is because of a sometimes too contracted conception of memory as just a temporal phenomenon, that the concept of cultural memory has often been exposed to misunderstanding. Nora pioneered connecting memory to physical, tangible locations, nowadays globally known and incorporated as ''lieux de mémoire''. He certifies these in his work as ''mises en abîme''; entities that symbolize a more complex piece of our history. Although he concentrates on a spatial approach to remembrance, Nora already points out in his early historiographical theories that memory goes beyond just tangible and visual aspects, thereby making it flexible and in flux. This rather problematic notion, also characterized by Terdiman as the '[[omnipresence]]' of memory, implies that for instance on a sensory level, a smell or a sound can become of cultural value, due to its commemorative effect.

Either in visualized or abstracted form, one of the largest complications of memorializing our past is the inevitable fact that it is absent. Every memory we try to reproduce becomes – as Terdiman states – a 'present past'. It is this impractical desire for recalling what is gone forever that brings to surface a feeling of [[nostalgia]], noticeable in many aspects of daily life but most specifically in cultural products.

==Cultural studies approach==

===Embodied memory===

Recently, interest has developed in the area of '[[Embodied cognition|embodied]] memory'. According to [[Paul Connerton]] the body can also be seen as a container, or carrier of memory, of two different types of social practice; inscribing and incorporating. The former includes all activities which are helpful for storing and retrieving information: photographing, writing, taping, etc. The latter implies skilled performances which are sent by means of physical activity, like a spoken word or a handshake. These performances are accomplished by the individual in an unconscious manner, and one might suggest that this memory carried in gestures and habits, is more authentic than 'indirect' memory via inscribing.

The first conceptions of embodied memory, in which the past is 'situated' in the body of the individual, derive from late nineteenth century thoughts of [[evolutionist]]s like [[Jean Baptiste Lamarck]] and [[Ernst Haeckel]]. Lamarck’s law of [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] and Haeckel's theory of [[recapitulation theory|ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny]], suggested that the individual is a summation of the whole history that had preceded him or her. (However, neither of these concepts is accepted by current science.)

===Objects===

Memory can, for instance, be contained in objects. [[Souvenir]]s and [[photograph]]s inhabit an important place in the cultural memory discourse. Several authors stress the fact that the relationship between memory and objects has changed since the nineteenth century. Stewart, for example, claims that our culture has changed from a culture of production to a culture of consumption. Products, according to Terdiman, have lost 'the memory of their own process' now, in times of [[mass-production]] and [[commodification]]. At the same time, he claims, the connection between memories and objects has been institutionalized and exploited in the form of trade in souvenirs. These specific objects can refer to either a distant time (an [[antique]]) or a distant (exotic) place. Stewart explains how our souvenirs authenticate our experiences and how they are a survival sign of events that exist only through the invention of [[narrative]].

This notion can easily be applied to another practice that has a specific relationship with memory: [[photography]]. Catherine Keenan explains how the act of taking a picture can underline the importance of remembering, both individually and collectively. Also she states that pictures cannot only stimulate or help memory, but can rather eclipse the actual memory – when we remember in terms of the photograph – or they can serve as a reminder of our propensity to forget. Others have argued that photographs can be incorporated in memory and therefore supplement it.

[[Edward Chaney]] has coined the term 'Cultural Memorials' to describe both generic types, such as obelisks or sphinxes, and specific objects, such as the Obelisk of Domitian, Abu Simbel or 'The Young Memnon', which have meanings attributed to them that evolve over time. Readings of ancient Egyptian artefacts by [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], the Collector [[Earl of Arundel]], 18th-century travellers, [[Napoleon]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[William John Bankes|William Bankes]], [[Harriet Martineau]], [[Florence Nightingale]] or Sigmund and Lucian [[Freud]], reveal a range of interpretations variously concerned with reconstructing the intentions of their makers.

==Between culture and memory: experience==

As a contrast to the sometimes generative nature of previously mentioned studies on cultural memory, an alternative 'school' with its origins in [[gender]] and postcolonial studies underscored the importance of the individual and particular memories of those unheard in most collective accounts: women, minorities, homosexuals, etc.

[[Experience]], whether it be lived or imagined, relates mutually to culture and memory. It is influenced by both factors, but determines these at the same time. Culture influences experience by offering mediated perceptions that affect it, as Frigga Haug states by opposing conventional theory on femininity to lived memory. In turn, as historians such as Neil Gregor have argued, experience affects culture, since individual experience becomes communicable and therefore collective.  A memorial, for example, can represent a shared sense of loss.

The influence of memory is made obvious in the way the past is experienced in present conditions, for – according to Paul Connerton, for instance – it can never be eliminated from human practice. On the other hand, it is perception driven by a longing for authenticity that colors memory, which is made clear by a desire to experience the real (Susan Stewart). Experience, therefore, is substantial to the interpretation of culture as well as memory, and vice versa.

==Traumatic memory transmission==
{{Main|Transgenerational trauma}}
Traumatic transmissions are articulated over time not only through social sites or institutions but also through cultural, political, and familial generations, a key social mechanism of continuity and renewal across human groups, cohorts, and communities. The intergenerational transmission of collective trauma is a well-established phenomenon in the scholarly literature on psychological, familial, sociocultural, and biological modes of transmission. Ordinary processes of remembering and transmission can be understood as cultural practices by which people recognize a lineage, a debt to their past, and through which "they express moral continuity with that past."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = State Terrorism and the Politics of Memory in Latin America: Transmissions Across The Generations of Post-Dictatorship Uruguay, 1984–2004|last = Fried Amilivia|first = Gabriela|publisher = Cambria Press|year = 2016|isbn = 9781604979190|location = Amherst, New York|pages = 24, 26|url = http://www.cambriapress.com/books/9781604979190.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intergenerationality|intergenerational preservation]], transformation, and transmutation of traumatic memory such as of [[genocide]] tragic historical legacy can be assimilated, redeemed, and transformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adelman|first1=A.|title=Traumatic memory and the intergenerational transmission of Holocaust narratives|journal=The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|date=1995|volume=50|pages=343–367|issn=0079-7308|doi=10.1080/00797308.1995.11822409|pmid=7480412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
Recent research and theorizing in cultural memory has emphasized the importance of considering the content of cultural identities in understanding the study of social relations and predicting cultural attitudes.

The Institute of Germanic &amp; Romance Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of London, has developed its MA degree around the above-mentioned topics.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100222220029/http://igrs.sas.ac.uk/postgraduate/mamres-programmes/cultural-memory.html MA in Cultural Memory] has now been running for 10 years. This unique degree explores the many different ways in which culture is based on the construction, manipulation and transmission of memories, and the role played by memory in collective and individual identity formation.

The degree programme is supplemented by a Cultural Memory Seminar and by the [http://modernlanguages.sas.ac.uk new Centre for the Study of Cultural Memory].

In 2008, the first issue of quarterly journal ''[[Memory Studies (journal)|Memory Studies]]'' concerning subjects of and relating to cultural memory was published by [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]].

== Other approaches ==
[[Jan Assmann]] in his book "Das kulturelle Gedächtnis", drew further upon [[Maurice Halbwachs]]'s theory on [[collective memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Assmann, J. (1992) ''Das Kulturelle Gedächtnis: Schrift, Erinnerung und Politische Identität in frühen Hochkulturen.'' Munich: Verlag C.H. Beck&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars like [[Andreas Huyssen]] have identified a general interest in memory and [[mnemonics]] since the early 1980s, illustrated by phenomena as diverse as [[memorial]]s and [[retro]]-culture.  Some might see cultural memory as becoming more democratic, due to liberalization and the rise of [[new media]].  Others see cultural memory as remaining concentrated in the hands of corporations and states.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The '''Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act''' ('''CISA''' {{USBill|113|S|2588}} [113th Congress], {{USBill|114|S|754}} [114th Congress]) is a [[United States federal law]] designed to "improve [[cybersecurity]] in the United States through enhanced sharing of information about cybersecurity threats, and for other purposes".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.feinstein.senate.gov%2Fpublic/index.cfm/files/serve/?File_id=08de1c1b-446b-478c-84a8-0c3f35963216 "Discussion Draft of the 'Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2014' (S.2588)"], 113th Congress, 2d Session, June 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The law allows the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S. government and technology and manufacturing companies. The bill was introduced in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] on July 10, 2014, and passed in the Senate October 27, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754 S.754 - Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  Opponents question CISA's value, believing it will move responsibility from private businesses to the government, thereby increasing vulnerability of personal private information, as well as dispersing personal private information across seven government agencies, including the NSA and local police.

The text of the bill was incorporated by amendment into a [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016|consolidated spending bill]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] on December 15, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029 H.R.2029 - Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; which was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on December 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/18/house-senate-pass-budget-with-cisa/ Budget bill heads to President Obama's desk with CISA intact]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act was introduced on July 10, 2014 during the 113th Congress, and was able to pass the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] by a vote of 12-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2014/07/09/controversial-cybersecurity-bill-known-as-cisa-advances-out-of-senate-committee/|title=Controversial Cybersecurity Bill Known As CISA Advances Out Of Senate Committee|publisher=Forbes|author=Gregory S. McNeal|date=9 Jul 2014|accessdate=31 Jul 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill did not reach a full senate vote before the end of the congressional session.

The bill was reintroduced for the 114th Congress on March 12, 2015, and the bill passed the Senate Intelligence Committee by a vote of 14-1.&lt;ref&gt;

==Provisions==
The main provisions of the bill make it easier for companies to share personal information with the government, especially in cases of cyber security threats. Without requiring such information sharing, the bill creates a system for federal agencies to receive threat information from private companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kominsky|first=Mitchell|date=February 2014|title=The Current Landscape of Cybersecurity Policy: Legislative Issues in the 113th Congress|url=http://harvardnsj.org/2014/02/the-current-landscape-of-cybersecurity-policy-legislative-issues-in-the-113th-congress/|journal=Harvard Law School National Security Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to privacy, the bill includes provisions for preventing the act of sharing data known to be both personally identifiable and irrelevant to cyber security. &lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt; Any personal information which does not get removed during the sharing procedure can be used in a variety of ways. These shared cyber threat indicators can be used to prosecute cyber crimes, but may also be used as evidence for crimes involving physical force.&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/cisa-security-bill-gets-f-security-spying/|title=CISA Security Bill: An F for Security But an A+ for Spying|publisher=Wired|author=Andy Greenberg|date=20 Mar 2015|accessdate=31 Jul 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==

===Businesses and trade groups===
The CISA has received some support from advocacy groups, including the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercehomelandsecurity.com/story/industry-rep-businesses-get-stronger-liability-protection-sharing-cyber-thr/2015-03-05|title=Industry rep: Businesses get stronger liability protection for sharing cyber threat info under CISA|publisher=Fierce Homeland Security|author=Dibya Sarkar|date=Mar 5, 2015|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association]], and the [[Financial Services Roundtable]].&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt;

A number of business groups have also opposed the bill, including the [[Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcinno.streetwise.co/2015/10/20/cisa-senate-vote-cybersecurity-information-sharing-act-congress/|title=Apple, Google and Friends Join Forces Ahead of Crucial CISA Decision |author=Chris Bing|date=20 Oct 2015|accessdate=20 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as individual companies such as [[Twitter]], [[Yelp]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Reddit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/10/20/twitter-slams-controversial-cybersecurity-bill.html|title=Twitter slams controversial cybersecurity bill|publisher=Fox News|author=James Rogers |date=20 Oct 2015|accessdate=20 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BSA (The Software Alliance)]] appeared initially supportive of CISA, sending a letter on July 21, 2015 urging the senate to bring the bill up for debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/248645-software-industry-urges-action-on-senate-cyber-bill|title=Software industry urges action on Senate cyber bill|publisher=The Hill|author=Cory Bennett|date=July 21, 2015|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, 2015, the BSA published a letter of support for amongst other things cyber threat information sharing legislation addressed to Congress, signed by board members [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Altium]], [[Autodesk]], [[CA, Inc.|CA Technologies]], [[DataStax]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Minitab]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Salesforce.com]], [[Siemens]], and [[Symantec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsa.org/~/media/Files/Policy/data/09142015CongLeadershipDataAgendaLetter.pdf |title=Congressional Leadership Data Agenda Letter |date=September 14, 2015 |publisher=BSA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the digital rights advocacy group [[Fight for the Future]] to organize a protest against CISA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youbetrayedus.org/ |title=Betrayed by Tech |publisher=Fight for the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this opposition campaign, BSA stated that its letter expressed support for cyber threat sharing legislation in general, but did not endorse CISA, or any pending cyber threat sharing bill in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/09/24/tech-vendor-cybersecurity-bill/|title=Apple, Microsoft, others slammed for supporting cybersecurity bill|publisher=Fortune|author=Barb Darrow|date=24 Sep 2015|accessdate=4 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/marc-benioff-tweets-against-cisa-2015-9|title=A few tweets from Salesforce's Marc Benioff threaten to squash a cyber-spying law|publisher=Business Insider|author=Julie Bort|date=28 Sep 2015|accessdate=4 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; BSA later stated that it is opposed to CISA in its current form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Security|url = http://www.bsa.org/policy/security/?sc_lang=en-US|website = www.bsa.org|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association]], another major trade group including members such as [[Google]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Cloudflare]], [[Netflix]], [[Facebook]], [[Red Hat]], and [[Yahoo!]], also announced its opposition to the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = CCIA Urges Senate To Improve Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act|url = https://www.ccianet.org/2015/10/ccia-urges-senate-to-improve-cybersecurity-information-sharing-act/|website = www.ccianet.org/|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government officials===
Proponents of CISA include the bill's main cosponsors, senators [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-CA) and [[Richard Burr]] (R-NC).&lt;ref name=NearsVote&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/editorial/kaveh-waddell|title=Cybersecurity Bill Nears Crucial Senate Vote |publisher=National Journal|author=Kaveh Waddell|date=20 Oct 2015|accessdate=20 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some senators have announced opposition to CISA, including [[Ron Wyden]] (D-OR), [[Rand Paul]] (R-KY), and [[Bernie Sanders]] (I-VT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/bernie-sanders-cisa-senate-2016-presidential-candidates/|title=Bernie Sanders comes out against CISA, a controversial cybersecurity bill|publisher=Daily Dot|author=Eric Geller|date=12 Oct 2015|accessdate=20 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) has objected to the bill based on a classified legal opinion from the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] written during the early [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W Bush Administration]]. The [[Obama administration]] states that it does not rely on the legal justification laid out in the memo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/what-s-inside-the-justice-department-s-secret-cybersecurity-memo-20150727|title=What’s Inside the Justice Department’s Secret Cybersecurity Memo?|publisher=National Journal|author=Dustin Volz|date=July 27, 2015|accessdate=July 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/13/cisa-cybersecurity-surveillance-government-data-access|title=A government surveillance bill by any other name is just as dangerous|publisher=The Guardian|author=Trevor Timm|date=June 13, 2015|accessdate=July 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wyden has made repeated requests to the [[US Attorney General]] to declassify the memo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150204/05522629903/senator-wyden-follows-up-with-eric-holder-all-requests-doj-has-totally-ignored.shtml|title=Senator Wyden Follows Up With Eric Holder On All Of The Requests The DOJ Has Totally Ignored|publisher=Tech Dirt|author= Mike Masnick|date=4 Feb 2015|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; dating at least as far back as when a 2010 [[Office of Inspector General]] report cited the memo as a legal justification for the FBI's warrantless wire-tapping program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/02/obamas-secret-wiretap-memo/35134/|title=Obama's Secret Wiretap Memo|series=DHS/NPPD/PIA-029 Automated Indicator Sharing|publisher=The Atlantic|author=Marc Ambinder|date=February 1, 2010|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2015, White House spokesman Eric Schultz endorsed the legislation, calling for the senate to "take up this bill as soon as possible and pass it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/250241-white-house-endorses-senate-cyber-bill|title=White House endorses Senate cyber bill|publisher=The Hill|author=Cory Bennett|date=4 Aug 2015|accessdate=4 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] initially supported the bill, with [[Jeh Johnson]], the secretary of the DHS, calling for the bill to move forward on September 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/253803-dhs-head-to-senate-move-on-stalled-cybersecurity-bill|title=Homeland Security chief pushes Senate to move cyber bill|publisher=The Hill|author=16 Sep 2015|accessdate=20 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an August 3 letter to senator [[Al Franken]] (D-MN), the deputy secretary of the DHS, [[Alejandro Mayorkas]], expressed a desire to have all connections be brokered by the DHS, given the Department's charter to protect the executive branch networks. In the letter, the DHS found issue with the direct sharing of information with all government agencies, advocating instead that the DHS be the sole recipient of cyberthreat information, allowing it to scrub out private information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/dhs-cisa-letter/|title=Homeland Security joins privacy groups in pushback against CISA|publisher=The Daily Dot|author=Eric Geller|date=3 Aug 2015|accessdate=20 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Department of Homeland Security has published a Privacy Impact Assessment detailing its internal review of the proposed system for handling incoming indicators from Industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhsnppdpia-029-automated-indicator-sharing|publisher=The Department of Homeland Security|title=DHS/NPPD/PIA-029 Automated Indicator Sharing|date=28 Oct 2015|accessdate=18 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil liberties groups===
Privacy advocates were aghast in October when the [https://www.wired.com/2015/10/cisa-cybersecurity-information-sharing-act-passes-senate-vote-with-privacy-flaws/ Senate passed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act by a vote of 74 to 21], leaving intact portions of the law they say make it more amenable to surveillance than actual security while quietly stripping out several of its remaining privacy protections.
CISA has been criticized by advocates of [[Internet privacy]] and [[civil liberties]], such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/zombie-bill-comes-back-look-senates-cybersecurity-information-sharing-act-2014 "A Zombie Bill Comes Back to Life: A Look at The Senate's Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2014"], Mark Jaycox, Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), June 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-technology-and-liberty/beware-dangers-congress-latest-cybersecurity-bill "Beware the Dangers of Congress’ Latest Cybersecurity Bill"], Sandra Fulton, ACLU (Washington), June 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been compared to the criticized [[Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act]] proposals of 2012 and 2013, which passed the United States House of Representatives, but did not pass the Senate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2129">'''Distortionmeter''' (or more precisely distortion factor meter) is an electronic measuring instrument which displays the amount of distortion added to the original signal by an electronic  circuit.

== Harmonic distortion ==

[[Distortion|Harmonic distortion]] is equivalent to adding harmonics to a signal. When a purely sinusoidal signal is in this way, a series of harmonics is superimposed on the original signal, and can be detected with suitable equipment.
 
If the input is 

:&lt;math&gt; {f_i}=a_1 \cdot sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

The normalized output is 

:&lt;math&gt; {f_o}=a_1 \cdot sin(\omega t)+a_2 \cdot sin(2 \omega t)+a_3 \cdot sin(3 \omega t)+..&lt;/math&gt; 

The value of Total Harmonics Distortion (THD) is defined as the ratio of the harmonics to the fundamental; 
&lt;ref&gt;Reference data for Radio Engineers, Howard W.Sams &amp; co.ITT, {{ISBN|0-672-21218-8}}, p.18-12&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.,

&lt;math&gt; THD = \frac{\sqrt{{a_2}^2+{a_3}^2+..}}{a_1}&lt;/math&gt;

This ratio can be given in [[decibel|dB]] or in percentage.

== The instrument ==

A distortionmeter is actually a levelmeter with two switchable parallel circuits at the input. The first circuit measures the total signal at the output of a system. (For low distortion levels this will be almost equal to fundamental). That value is adjusted to read 100% or, equivalently, to 0 dB. The second circuit is a filter which removes (as much as practical) the fundamental frequency.  This can be a notch filter, one which passes all but the fundamental, with negligible attenuation at other frequencies (including whatever harmonics might be present).  Alternatively, if the distortion products are at higher frequencies, a [[highpass filter]] can be used if its cutoff rate is sufficiently steep to not affect the expected distortion products.  The output of the filter is measured as a percentage of the fundamental, and the reported value will be the distortion value.

[[Empathy]] has been studied in the context of [[online communities]] as it pertains to enablers of interpersonal communication, [[Internet anonymity|anonymity]], as well as barriers to online relationships, such as ambiguity, [[cyberbullying]] and [[Internet troll]]ing.
It has been found that on online health support communities members tend to exhibit higher levels of empathic concern.&lt;ref name="Djikic 28–47"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reading other minds: Effects of literature on empathy|url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/ssol/2013/00000003/00000001/art00006|journal = Scientific Study of Literature|date = 2013-01-01|access-date = 2015-04-20|pages = 28–47|volume = 3|issue = 1|doi = 10.1075/ssol.3.1.06dji|first = Maja|last = Djikic|first2 = Keith|last2 = Oatley|first3 = Mihnea C.|last3 = Moldoveanu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Empathic Exchanges in Online Cancer Support Groups: Distinguishing Message Expression and Reception Effects|journal = Health Communication|date = February 28, 2011|issn = 1041-0236|pmid = 21318917|pages = 185–197|volume = 26|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/10410236.2010.544283|first = Jeong Yeob|last = Han|first2 = Dhavan V.|last2 = Shah|first3 = Eunkyung|last3 = Kim|first4 = Kang|last4 = Namkoong|first5 = Sun-Young|last5 = Lee|first6 = Tae Joon|last6 = Moon|first7 = Rich|last7 = Cleland|first8 = Q.

== Comparison/contrast with empathy in offline environments ==
A number of studies have explored the importance of empathy in offline settings. For example, one study found that mindfulness and acceptance-based behavioral approaches may have potential for increasing empathy in interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The case for mindfulness-based approaches in the cultivation of empathy: Does nonjudgmental, present-moment awareness increase capacity for perspective-taking and empathic concern?|date = 2007|journal = Journal of Marital and Family Therapy|doi = 10.1111/j.1752-0606.2007.00034.x|pmid = 17935532|access-date = |volume=33 |issue = 4|pages=501–16 | last1 = Block-Lerner | first1 = J | last2 = Adair | first2 = C | last3 = Plumb | first3 = JC | last4 = Rhatigan | first4 = DL | last5 = Orsillo | first5 = SM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other work has explored the link between fiction and empathy, suggesting that the experience-taking quality of fiction may increase empathy among readers.&lt;ref name="Djikic 28–47"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://faculty.psy.ohio-state.edu/libby/lab/Publications_files/Kaufman%26Libby2012.pdf|title = Changing beliefs and behavior through experience-taking|last = Kaufman; Libby|first = Geoff; LK|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi = 10.1037/a0027525|pmid = 22448888|access-date =|volume=103|issue = 1|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that individuals tend to more readily feel empathy for those that they view as similar to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | access-date=2015-04-20 | url=http://spr.sagepub.com/content/20/3/267 | title=Empathy as an Interpersonal Phenomenon | date=June 1, 2003 | last=Håkansson | first=Jakob | last2=Montgomery | first2=Henry | journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume=20 | issue=3 | pages=267–284 | issn=0265-4075 | doi=10.1177/0265407503020003001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In online contexts, several researchers have pointed out that there are some key differences in how users interact online that may affect levels of empathy. For example, communication in online forum communities interact asynchronously, and are generally text-based rather than verbal communications.&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Internet and Health Communication: Experiences and Expectations|url = https://books.google.com/?id=plZ2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Experiencing+Empathy+Online&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Experiencing+empathy+online|publisher = SAGE Publications|date = 2000-11-17|access-date = 2015-04-20|isbn = 9781452264424|first = Ronald E.|last = Rice|first2 = James E.|last2 = Katz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishment of trust in online communities may also operate differently in online environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Patterns of Empathy in Online Communication|publisher = ACM|date = 2007|isbn = 978-1-59593-593-9|pages = 919–928|series = CHI '07|doi = 10.1145/1240624.1240763|first = Ulrike|last = Pfeil|first2 = Panayiotis|last2 = Zaphiris|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI '07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, communications related interactions with others online might facilitate empathy while video or online gaming might negatively affect empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, L. Mark, Spradlin, A., Bunce, J. P., &amp; Rosen, L. D. (2015). Virtual empathy: Positive and negative effects of going online upon empathy in young adults, Computers in Human Behavior, 52, 39-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enablers ==
* '''Anonymity. '''The anonymous nature of many online communities can allow individuals to feel more comfortable disclosing more personal information, which in turn can increase feelings of trust, connectedness and empathy.&lt;ref name="Rice"/&gt;
* '''Shared interests. '''Because empathy tends to be strongest among those that share common experiences, the presence of niche online communities can set the stage for higher levels of empathy among members.''' '''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Barriers ==
* '''[[Cyberbullying]]''' is any bullying that takes place using electronic media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Cyberbullying|url = http://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it/|website = Stopbullying.gov|accessdate = 2015-04-20| publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]|date = 2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' '''Studies have suggested that individuals who are bystanders, that is, witnessing someone bullying someone else, are less likely to intervene in online contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cyberbullying among Adolescent Bystanders: Role of the Communication Medium, Form of Violence, and Empathy | doi=10.1002/casp.2137|volume=23|journal=Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology|pages=37–51|year = 2013 |last1 = Barlińska |first1 = Julia | last2=Szuster| first2=Anna| last3=Winiewski| first3=Mikołaj}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Internet trolling]]''' is "the practice of behaving in a deceptive, destructive, or disruptive manner in a social setting on the Internet with no apparent instrumental purpose." Although empirical research on trolling is limited, studies have suggested that internet trolling may be a space occupied by already-sadistic individuals who can easily disrupt conversations and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Trolls just want to have fun|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886914000324|accessdate = 2015-04-20|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2014.01.016|volume=67|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|pages=97–102|year = 2014|last1 = Buckels|first1 = Erin E.|last2 = Trapnell|first2 = Paul D.|last3 = Paulhus|first3 = Delroy L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;              
* '''Ambiguity.''' Because asynchronous, text-mediated online conversations lack the richness of interaction and cues that face-to-face interaction provides, online communication tends to be much more ambiguous. This ambiguity may decrease members' abilities to find similarities in one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Getting to know you: Face-to-face versus online interactions|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321000213X|accessdate = 2015-04-20|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.07.017|volume=27|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|pages=153–159|year = 2011|last1 = Okdie|first1 = Bradley M.|last2 = Guadagno|first2 = Rosanna E.|last3 = Bernieri|first3 = Frank J.|last4 = Geers|first4 = Andrew L.|last5 = McLarney-Vesotski|first5 = Amber R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both online and offline interactions, increased perceived similarity is associated with increased empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = (Preece J.)

'''Erotic asphyxiation''' (variously called '''asphyxiophilia''', '''hypoxyphilia''' or '''breath control play''') is the intentional restriction of [[oxygen]] to the brain for the purposes of [[sexual arousal]]. The term '''autoerotic asphyxiation''' is used when the act is done by a person to him- or herself. Colloquially, a person engaging in the activity is sometimes called a ''gasper''.&lt;ref name="Lost English"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Chris|title=Lost English: Words And Phrases That Have Vanished From Our Language|date=30 January 2012|publisher=Michael O'Mara Books|isbn=978-1843172789|page=66}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The erotic interest in asphyxiation is classified as a [[paraphilia]] in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].

==Physiology==
Author John Curra wrote, "The [[carotid arteries]] (on either side of the neck) carry [[oxygen]]-rich blood from the heart to the brain. When these are compressed, as in strangulation or hanging, the sudden loss of oxygen to the brain and the accumulation of [[carbon dioxide]] can increase feelings of giddiness, lightheadedness, and pleasure, all of which will heighten masturbatory sensations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Relativity of Deviance|author=John Curra|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, California|year=2000|page=111|isbn=0-7619-0778-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author George Shuman describes the effect as such, "When the brain is deprived of oxygen, it induces a lucid, semi-hallucinogenic state called [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Combined with [[orgasm]], the rush is said to be no less powerful than cocaine, and highly addictive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Last Breath: A Sherry Moore Novel|author=George D. Shuman|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2007|page=80|isbn=1-4165-3491-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning hallucinogenic states brought about by chronic hypoxia, Dr. E L Lloyd notes that they may be similar to the hallucinations experienced by climbers at altitude. He further notes that no such state occurs in hypoxia brought about by sudden aircraft decompression at altitude. These findings suggest to him that they do not arrive purely from a lack of oxygen. Upon examining the studies on hypoxia he found that "abnormalities in the cerebral neurochemistry involving one or more of the interconnected [[neurotransmitters]], [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[beta-endorphin]] had been reported in all the conditions associated with hallucinations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Points: Hallucinations, hypoxia, and neurotransmitters|author=Dr. E L Lloyd|publisher=British Medical Journal Volume 292| date=29 March 1986|page=903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Historically, the practice of autoerotic asphyxiation has been documented since the early 17th century. It was first used as a treatment for [[erectile dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sataniclust.com/04_06/pro_0406_asphyxiation.htm|title=Erotic Asphyxiation|work=Lust Magazine|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for this most likely came from subjects who were executed by [[hanging]]. Observers at public hangings noted that male victims developed an [[erection]], sometimes remaining after death (a [[death erection]]), and occasionally [[ejaculation|ejaculated]] when being hanged. However, [[post-mortem ejaculation]] occurs in hanging victims after death because of disseminated muscle relaxation; this is a different mechanism from that sought by autoerotic asphyxiation practitioners.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Practice==
Various methods are used to achieve the level of oxygen depletion needed, such as a hanging, suffocation with a plastic bag over the head, self-[[strangulation]] such as with a [[Ligature (medicine)|ligature]], gas or volatile solvents, chest compression, or some combination of these.&lt;ref name = Blanchard1991/&gt; Sometimes, complicated devices are used to produce the desired effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Halloran | first1 = R.

E. | year = 1993 | title = Autoerotic fatalities with power hydraulics | url = | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 359–364 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice can be dangerous even if performed with care and has resulted in a significant number of accidental deaths. Uva (1995) writes “Estimates of the mortality rate of autoerotic asphyxia range from 250 to 1000 deaths per year in the United States.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Uva | first1 = J.

== Accidental death ==
{{See also|Autoerotic fatality}}

Deaths often occur when the loss of consciousness caused by partial asphyxia leads to loss of control over the means of strangulation, resulting in continued asphyxia and death. While often asphyxiophilia is incorporated into sex with a partner, others enjoy this behaviour by themselves, making it potentially more difficult to get out of dangerous situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/autoerotic-asphyxiophilia Autoerotic Asphyxiophilia] on 'Sexinfo' website, University of Santa Barbara, Ca.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some fatality cases, the body of the asphyxiophilic individual is discovered naked or with genitalia in hand, with pornographic material or sex toys present, or with evidence of having orgasmed prior to death.&lt;ref name = Janssen2005/&gt; Bodies found at the scene of an accidental death often show evidence of other [[paraphilic]] activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00000433-199103000-00012 | last1 = Bogliolo | first1 = L.

===Famous cases===
[[File:Sada Abe.jpg|thumb|Newspaper photo taken shortly after the arrest of [[Sada Abe]] ''(center)'' in [[Tokyo]] on May 20, 1936]]
* [[Peter Anthony Motteux]], English author, playwright, translator, publisher and editor of ''The Gentleman's Journal'', "the first English magazine", from 1692 to 1694, died from apparent autoerotic asphyxiation in 1718, which is probably the first recorded case.
* [[Frantisek Kotzwara]], composer, died from erotic asphyxiation in 1791.
* [[Sada Abe]] killed her lover, [[Kichizo Ishida]] through strangulation while he was sleeping, after having experimented with erotic asphyxiation, in 1936, proceeding to cut off his [[human penis|penis]] and [[testicles]] and carry them around with her in her handbag for a number of days. The case caused a sensation in 1930s Japan and has remained one of the most famous Japanese murder cases of all time.
* [[Albert Dekker]], stage and screen actor, was found dead in his bathroom in 1968 with his body graffitied and a noose around his neck.
* [[Vaughn Bodé]], artist, died from this cause in 1975.
* Diane Herceg sued ''[[Hustler (magazine)|Hustler]]'' magazine in 1983, accusing it of causing the death of her 14-year-old son, Troy D., who had experimented with autoerotic asphyxia after reading about it in that publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== In fiction ==
{{refimprove|date=September 2018}}
The sensational nature of autoerotic asphyxiation often makes it the subject of [[urban legends]].  It has also been mentioned specifically in a number of works of fiction.
* In the [[Marquis de Sade]]'s famous novel ''Justine, or The Misfortunes of the Virtue'', Justine is subjected to this by one of her captors.  She survives the encounter.
* In the Guts short story in [[Chuck Palahniuk|Chuck Palahniuk's]] novel [[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)|''Haunted'']], one the characters discusses parents who discover the accidental deaths of their sons to autoerotic asphyxiation.  They are said to cover up the deaths before police or coroners arrive to save the family from shame.
* In the novel (and later movie adaptation) ''[[Rising Sun (novel)|Rising Sun]]'', death as a result of this type of sexual arousal is explained when it is offered as a possible cause for a murder victim's death.
* In the film ''[[World's Greatest Dad]]'', the protagonist's teenage son accidentally kills himself with asphyxiation whilst sexually aroused. The protagonist then stages his son's death as a suicide, which gives him the opportunity to rise to infamy via a [[Literary forgery|literary hoax]].
* In the film ''[[Ken Park]]'' a character named Tate practices autoerotic asphyxia.
* Autoerotic asphyxiation occurs in the [[cold open]] of ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' episode ''Back to the Garden''. 
* [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] from ''[[South Park]]'' dies from suffocating while wearing a [[Batman]] costume and practicing autoerotic asphyxia in the episode "[[Sexual Healing (South Park)|Sexual Healing]]". 
* In the season four episode of ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'', titled "Monkey Business", the character Zig Semetauer is found dead in his bathroom by [[Hank Moody|Hank]], Charlie and Stu after suffocating due to autoerotic asphyxia, to which Hank quips "I'm not averse to the occasional choke-n'-stroke, but this is a prime example of why one must always use a [[buddy system]]."
* A character in the film ''[[Knocked Up]]'' offers to be a "[[:wikt:spotter|spotter]]" for a friend if he intends on performing autoerotic asphyxiation.
* Bruce Robertson, the main character in the 1998 [[Irvine Welsh]] novel, ''[[Filth (novel)|Filth]]'' engages in the practice.  This is also depicted in the 2013 film adaptation.
*In the sixth episode, season two of [[BoJack Horseman|Bojack Horseman]], autoerotic asphyxiation and celebrity deaths are recurrent discussions.

'''Evolutionary musicology''' is a subfield of [[biomusicology]] that grounds the psychological mechanisms of [[music perception]] and [[music production (music psychology)|production]] in [[evolutionary theory]]. It covers [[Animal communication|vocal communication]] in non-human animal species, theories of the evolution of human music, and cross-cultural human universals in musical ability and processing.

== History ==
The origins of the field can be traced back to [[Charles Darwin]] who wrote in his [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|Descent of Man]]:
: "When we treat of sexual selection we shall see that primeval man, or rather some early progenitor of man, probably first used his voice in producing true musical cadences, that is in singing, as do some of the gibbon-apes at the present day; and we may conclude from a widely-spread analogy, that this power would have been especially exerted during the courtship of the sexes,—would have expressed various emotions, such as love, jealousy, triumph,—and would have served as a challenge to rivals.  It is, therefore, probable that the imitation of musical cries by articulate sounds may have given rise to words expressive of various complex emotions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|authorlink=[[Charles Darwin]]|title=The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|year=1871|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext00/dscmn10.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory of a musical protolanguage has been revived and re-discovered repeatedly, often without attribution to Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Music|year=2000|publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |author=Nils L. Wallin, Björn Merker, and Steven Brown (Editors)|isbn=0-262-23206-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Mithen, ''The Singing Neanderthals: the Origins of Music, Language, Mind and Body'', Harvard University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origins of music ==
{{See also|Prehistoric music|Music archaeology|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}
Two major topics for any subfield of [[evolutionary psychology]] are the adaptive function (if any) and phylogenetic history of the mechanism or behavior of interest including when music arose in human ancestry and from what ancestral traits it developed. Current debate addresses each of these.

One part of the adaptive function question is whether music constitutes an evolutionary [[adaptation]] or [[exaptation]] (i.e. by-product of evolution). [[Steven Pinker]], in his book ''[[How the Mind Works]]'', for example, argues that music is merely "auditory [[cheesecake]]"—it was evolutionarily adaptive to have a preference for fat and sugar but cheesecake did not play a role in that selection process. This view has been directly countered by numerous music researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Perlovsky L. Music. Cognitive Function, Origin, And Evolution Of Musical Emotions. WebmedCentral PSYCHOLOGY 2011;2(2):WMC001494&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison Abbott. 2002. Neurobiology: Music, maestro, please!

Adaptation, on the other hand, is highlighted in hypotheses such as the one by Edward Hagen and Gregory Bryant which posits that human music evolved from animal territorial signals, eventually becoming a method of signaling a group's social cohesion to other groups for the purposes of making beneficial multi-group alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hagen|first=Edward H|author-link=|last2=Bryant|first2=Gregory A|author2-link=|title=Music and dance as a coalition signaling system|journal=Human Nature|volume=14|issue=1|pages=21–51|year=2003|url=http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~hagen/papers/music.pdf|doi=10.1007/s12110-003-1015-z|id=|access-date=3 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612013500/http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~hagen/papers/music.pdf|archive-date=12 June 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hagen |first=Edward H |author2=Hammerstein P |year=2009 |title=Did Neanderthals and other early humans sing? Seeking the biological roots of music in the loud calls of primates, lions, hyenas, and wolves |journal=Musicae Scientiae |url=http://anthro.vancouver.wsu.edu/media/PDF/musicae.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The bipedalism hypothesis===
The evolutionary switch to bipedalism may have influenced the origins of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Matz|title=Self-generated sounds of locomotion and ventilation and the evolution of human rhythmic abilities|journal=Animal Cognition|date=August 2013|doi=10.1007/s10071-013-0678-z|volume=17|pages=1–14|pmc=3889703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The background is that noise of locomotion and ventilation may mask critical auditory information. Human locomotion is likely to produce more predictable sounds than those of non-human primates. Predictable locomotion sounds may have improved our capacity of entrainment to external rhythms and to feel the beat in music. A sense of rhythm could aid the brain in distinguishing among sounds arising from discrete sources and also help individuals to synchronize their movements with one another. Synchronization of group movement may improve perception by providing periods of relative silence and by facilitating auditory processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Matz|title=Possible functions of the octavolateralis system in fish schooling|journal=Fish and Fisheries|year=2009|volume=10|pages=344–355|doi=10.1111/j.1467-2979.2009.00330.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Matz|title=Incidental sounds of locomotion in animal cognition|journal=Animal Cognition|year=2012|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1007/s10071-011-0433-2|pmc=3249174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptive value of such skills to early human ancestors may have been keener detection of prey or stalkers and enhanced communication. Thus, bipedal walking may have influenced the development of entrainment in humans and thereby the evolution of rhythmic abilities. Primitive hominids lived and moved around in small groups. The noise generated by the locomotion of two or more individuals can result in a complicated mix of footsteps, breathing, movements against vegetation, echoes, etc. The ability to perceive differences in pitch, rhythm, and harmonies, i.e. “musicality,” could help the brain to distinguish among sounds arising from discrete sources, and also help the individual to synchronize movements with the group. Endurance and an interest in listening might, for the same reasons, have been associated with survival advantages eventually resulting in adaptive selection for rhythmic and musical abilities and reinforcement of such abilities. Listening to music seems to stimulate release of dopamine. Rhythmic group locomotion combined with attentive listening in nature may have resulted in reinforcement through dopamine release. A primarily survival-based behavior may eventually have attained similarities to [[dance]] and music, due to such reinforcement mechanisms . Since music may facilitate social cohesion, improve group effort, reduce conflict, facilitate perceptual and motor skill development, and improve trans-generational communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huron|first=David|title=Is music an evolutionary adaptation?|journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci|year=2001|volume=930|pages=43–61|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb05724.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; music-like behavior may at some stage have become incorporated into human culture.

Another proposed adaptive function is creating intra-group bonding. In this aspect it has been seen as complementary to language by creating strong positive emotions while not having a specific message people may disagree on. Music's ability to cause [[Entrainment (biomusicology)|entrainment]] (synchronization of behavior of different organisms by a regular beat) has also been pointed out. A different explanation is that signaling fitness and creativity by the producer or performer in order to attract mates. Still another is that music may have developed from human mother-infant auditory interactions ([[motherese]]) since humans have a very long period of infant and child development, infants can perceive musical features, and some infant-mother auditory interaction have resemblances to music.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 45 Music and cognitive evolution.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the problem in the debate is that music, like any complex cognitive function, is not a holistic entity but rather [[Modularity of mind|modular]]&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry A. (1983). Modularity of Mind: An Essay on Faculty Psychology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-56025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;—perception and production of [[rhythm]], [[melody|melodies]], [[harmony]] and other musical parameters may thus involve multiple cognitive functions with possibly quite distinct evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;Honing, H. (ed.) (2018). The Origins of Musicality. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Musilanguage hypothesis ===
{{Undue weight section|date=August 2011}}
"Musilanguage" is a term coined by Steven Brown to describe his hypothesis of the ancestral human traits that evolved into language and musical abilities. It is both a model of musical  and linguistic evolution and a term coined to describe a certain stage in that evolution. Brown argues that both music and human language have origins in a  "musilanguage" stage of evolution and that the structural features shared by music and language are not the results of mere chance parallelism, nor are they a function of one system emerging from the other. This model argues that "music emphasizes sound as emotive meaning and language emphasizes sound as referential meaning."&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown S|veditors=Wallin NL, Merker B, Brown S |date=1999-12-03|chapter=The "Musilanguage" Model of Music Evolution|title=The Origins of Music|isbn=0-262-23206-5|publisher=The MIT Press|pages=271&amp;ndash;301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musilanguage model is a structural model of music evolution, meaning that it views music's acoustic properties as effects of homologous precursor functions.  This can be contrasted with functional models of music evolution, which view music's innate physical properties to be determined by its adaptive roles.

The musilanguage evolutionary stage is argued to exhibit three properties found in both music and language: lexical tone, combinatorial phrase formation, and expressive phrasing mechanisms.  Many of these ideas have their roots in existing phonological theory in linguistics, but Brown argues that phonological theory has largely neglected the strong mechanistic parallels between melody, phrasing, and rhythm in speech and music. 
::Lexical tone refers to the pitch of speech as a vehicle for semantic meaning.  The importance of pitch to conveying musical ideas is well-known, but the linguistic importance of pitch is less obvious.  [[Tone (linguistics)|Tonal language]]s such as Thai and Cantonese, wherein the lexical meaning of a sound depends heavily on its pitch relative to other sounds, are seen as evolutionary artifacts of musilanguage.  Non-tonal, or "intonation" languages, which do not depend heavily on pitch for lexical meaning, are seen as evolutionary late-comers which have discarded their dependence on tone.  Intermediate states, known as [[pitch accent]] languages, which exhibit some lexical dependence on tone, but also depend heavily on intonation, are exemplified by [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language]].

::Combinatorial formation refers to the ability to form small phrases from different tonal elements.  These phrases must be able to exhibit melodic, rhythmic, and semantic variation, and must be able to combine with other phrases to create global [[melodic formula]]s capable of conveying emotive meaning.  Examples in modern speech would be the rules for arranging letters to form words and then words to form sentences.  In music, the notes of different scales are combined according to their own unique rules to form larger musical ideas.

::Expressive [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] is the device by which expressive emphasis can be added to the phrases, both at a local (in the sense of individual units) and global (in the sense of phrases) level.  There are numerous ways this can occur in both speech and music that exhibit interesting parallels.  For instance, the increase in the amplitude of a sound being played by an instrument accents that sound much the same way that an increase in amplitude can emphasize a particular point in speech.  Similarly, speaking very rapidly often creates a frenzied effect that mirrors that of a fast and agitated musical passage.

===AVID model of music evolution===
[[Joseph Jordania]] has suggested that music (as well as several other universal elements of contemporary human culture, including [[dance]] and [[body painting]]) was part of a predator control system used by early [[hominids]]. He suggested that rhythmic loud singing and drumming, together with the threatening rhythmic body movements and body painting, was the core element of the ancient "Audio-Visual Intimidating Display" (AVID).&lt;ref&gt;Jordania J. ''[[Who Asked the First Question?]] The Origins of Human Choral Singing, Intelligence, Language and Speech'' (2006) Logos&lt;/ref&gt; AVID  was also a key factor in putting the hominid group into a specific [[altered state of consciousness]] which he calls  "battle trance" where they would not feel fear and pain, and would be religiously dedicated to group interests. Jordania suggested that listening and dancing to the sounds of loud rhythmic rock music, used in many contemporary combat units before the combat missions is directly related to this.&lt;ref&gt;Jordania, J. (2009) ''Times to fight and times to relax: Singing and humming at the beginning of Human evolutionary history'' 1: 272-277&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the defense from predators, Jordania suggested that this system was the core strategy to obtain food via confrontational, or aggressive [[scavenging]].

Apart from loud rhythmic singing-stomping-dancing, Jordania also suggested that soft [[humming]] could have played an important role in the early human ([[hominid]]) evolution as [[contact calls]]. Many [[social animals]] produce seemingly haphazard and indistinctive sounds (like chicken cluck) when they are going about their everyday business ([[foraging]], feeding). These sounds have two functions: (1) to let group members know that they are among kin and there is no danger, and (2) in case of the appearance of any signs of danger (suspicious sounds, movements in a forest), the animal that notices danger first, stops moving, stops producing sounds, remains silent and looks in the direction of the danger sign. Other animals quickly follow suit and very soon all the group is silent and is scanning the environment for the possible danger. [[Charles Darwin]] was the first to notice this phenomenon on the example of the wild horses and the cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. ''Descent of Men'', 2004:123&lt;/ref&gt; Jordania suggested that for humans, as for many [[social animals]], silence can be a sign of danger, and that's why gentle humming and musical sounds relax humans (see the use of gentle music in [[music therapy]], [[lullaby|lullabies]])

==Academic background==
[[File:Bhaktisiddhanta.jpg|thumb|alt=A man in his 50s sitting with a pen in hand and pensively looking forward|[[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]] (1874-1937), the subject of Sardella's monograph.]]
Ferdinando Sardella studied at the [[University of Gothenburg]], and graduated with [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Bachelor of Theology|B.Th.]] degrees. Following his [[Master of Arts|MA]] in theology with the history of religions as his major subject,&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferdinando Sardella|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/people/ferdinando-sardella|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Uppsala&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferdinando Sardella|url=https://uppsala.academia.edu/FerdinandoSardella|work=Academia.edu|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sardella obtained a [[Ph.D.]] degree in 2010 at his alma mater on [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]], a prominent [[Bengali people|Bengali]] proponent of the ''bhakti'' tradition of [[Gaudiya Vaisnavism]] in the 20th century and founder of a movement called the [[Gaudiya Math]].&lt;ref name=Gothenburg&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferdinando Sardella, Senior lecturer, History of Religions|url=http://lir.gu.se/english/staff/teachers-and-researchers/ferdinando-sardella/|work=University of Gothenburg|accessdate=16 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201224359/http://lir.gu.se/english/staff/teachers-and-researchers/ferdinando-sardella/|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploring the Gaudiya Vaisnava bhakti school along with its philosophy and practice as taught by Bhaktisiddhanta, Sardella showed it to be a personalistic current that challenged the predominantly [[monism|monistic]] perception of Hinduism in the West. Hitherto relatively unknown, this strand of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]] ''bhakti'' later on gained global spread in the form of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]], or the [[Hare Krishna movement]], inspired by Bhaktisiddhanta's teachings.&lt;ref name=Gothenburg/&gt; In 2010 the [[Donner Institute]], attached to [[Abo Akademi University]], gave Sardella's dissertation their first newly established award  for "outstanding research into religion".&lt;ref name=Gothenburg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Donner institute|url=http://www.abo.fi/forskning/donnerska_institutet|work=Åbo Akademi University|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AboAward"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.abo.fi/forskning/di_priset|title = The DI Prize for Outstanding Research into Religion|accessdate = 19 January 2014|website = Abo Akademi University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the dissertation was published by [[Oxford University Press]] as a monograph that  [[Gavin Flood]] in his review called "a significant contribution to scholarship not only of the modern Gaudiya Vaisnava movement but also of the religious history of Bengal within the last half of the colonial period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flood|first=Gavin|title=Modern Hindu Personalism  The History, Life, and Thought of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati|url=http://global.oup.com/academic/product/modern-hindu-personalism-9780199865901?cc=se&amp;lang=en&amp;tab=reviews|work=Oxford University Press, USA|accessdate=20 January 2014|authorlink=Gavin Flood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Filamentation''' is the anomalous growth of certain [[bacteria]], such as ''[[E. coli]]'', in which cells continue to elongate but do not divide (no [[septum|septa]] formation). The cells that result from elongation without division have multiple chromosomal copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authors= Jaimes-Lizcano, Yuly A,, Hunn, Dayton D.,  Papadopoulos, Kyriakos D., 2014. |title= Filamentous Escherichia coli cells swimming in tapered microcapillaries. |publisher= Research in Microbiology 165: 166-174.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bacterial filamentation is often observed as a result of  bacteria responding to various stresses, including [[DNA damage]] or inhibition of replication. This may happen, for example, while responding to extensive DNA damage through the [[SOS response|SOS response system]]. Nutritional changes may also cause bacterial filamentation. Some of the key genes involved in filamentation in E.coli include ''sulA'' and ''minCD''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/content/short/175/4/1118 |title=Cell division inhibitors SulA and MinCD prevent formation of the FtsZ ring. - Bi and Lutkenhaus 175 (4): 1118 |publisher=The Journal of Bacteriology |date=February 1993 |accessdate=2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following genes have been connected to virulence using the G. mellonella infection model: BCR1,FLO8, KEM1, SUV3 and TEC1.  These genes are required for [[biofilm]] development from filamentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authors= Fuchs, Beth Burgwyn et al., 2010.|title=Role of filamentation in Galleria mellonella killing by Candida albicans.|publisher= Microbes and Infection 12: 488-496.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filamentation is a survival strategy that protects bacteria from stressors such as host effectors and protist predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authors= Jaimes-Lizcano, Yuly A,, Hunn, Dayton D.,  Papadopoulos, Kyriakos D., 2014. |title= Filamentous Escherichia coli cells swimming in tapered microcapillaries. |publisher= Research in Microbiology 165: 166-174.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy of filamentation is known to protect bacteria from antibiotic medicines taken by the host.

'''Gabriel Sionita''' ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]: Jibrā'īl aṣ-Ṣahyūnī; 1577, at [[Ehden]] in [[Lebanon]] – 1648, in Paris) was a learned [[Maronite]], famous for his role in the publication of the 1645 Parisian [[Polyglot (book)|polyglot]] of the Bible.

==Life==

Gabriel Sionita was born Jibrayil al-Sahyuni Al Karami in [[Mount Lebanon]], in the [[Maronite]] village of [[Ehden]], to an old family of village notables and clerics, known today as the Karam family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=al-Khuri|first1=Ighnatius Tannus|title=Jibrayil al-Sahyuni (1577-1648)|journal=al-Mashriq|date=February 1, 1940|issue=2|pages=253–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maronite Patriarch al-Rizzi or Sergius Risius (1581-1597) sent Sionita and nine other Maronite chidlren to Rome at the age of seven to study in the new Maronite College. In Rome, he learnt Latin and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] on top of his native [[Arabic]], and acquired a slight knowledge of Hebrew. He studied theology, but only went into the priesthood later, in Paris, aged 45.

[[Savary de Breves]] was French ambassador to Turkey and was interested in Oriental studies. When recalled from Rome, he took two Maronites with him to Paris, to assist in the publication of the polyglot under the auspices of [[de Thou]], the royal librarian, and [[Cardinal Duperron]]. The two Maronites were Gabriel Sionita and [[John Hesronita]], Gabriel being the more prominent of the two. They received an annual stipend of 600 livres, and Gabriel was appointed to the chair of Semitic languages at [[Sorbonne]].

Both de Thou and Duperron died within four years, and serious financial difficulties arose. In 1619, the [[assembly of French clergy]] at [[Blois]] granted 8,000 livres to support the undertaking; but through some malversation of funds, this money was never actually paid; at least, such is the accusation brought by Gabriel in his preface to the ''Syriac Psalter'', which he published. The Maronites seem to have become involved in pecuniary embarrassments, which led to feuds with the leaders of the undertaking. In 1619, however, by royal diploma, Gabriel's stipend had been raised to 1,200 livres. The following year he received the a doctorate, and two years later, the priesthood.

In 1626, as Gabriel held no classes owing to the lack of students, his stipend was curtailed. After some time, however, he was paid on the original offer; and in 1629, his salary was increased to 2,000 livres. In 1630, he recommenced work on the polyglot. He did not apply himself fully to the work, and was even accused of carelessness in the work. He again found himself in difficulties.

In the quarrel which ensued, [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]] supported the editor, [[Guy Michel Le Jay]], against the Maronites. As it was feared that Gabriel might leave the country, the cardinal had him imprisoned in [[Vincennes]] (1640). He was released after three months, when he had signed an undertaking and given sureties that he would prepare the texts for the polyglot. He completed his great task some time before his death, at the age of 71.

==Works==
Gabriel's work in the polyglot included revising and correcting almost all of the Syriac and Arabic texts. He translated the Arabic and Syriac texts into Latin, with the exceptions of the [[Book of Ruth]]. But he only made a revision and not a fresh translation of the Gospels into Latin, nor did he translate from Syriac into Latin the [[Sapiential Books]] or the Apocalypse. Together with John Hesronita and [[Victor Sciala]], he published a Latin translation of the (Arabic) Psalter in 1614. In 1616, he published a document on Arabic grammar, of which one division (Liber I) appeared, containing the rules for reading.

In 1619, his ''Geographia Nubiensis'' (meaning a translation of the Maronite editions of the same) of [[Edrisi]]'s geography, with a small treatise as an appendix, "De nonnullis Orient. urb. nec non indig. relig. ac. moribus". In 1634, he was issued a ''Poema enigmaticum'' in praise of Divine wisdom by an ancient Syrian philosopher.

1630 saw the publication of his ''Testamentum et pactiones inter Mohammedem et Christianae fidei cultores'', an edition of the medieval Arabic document, the [[Achtiname of Muhammad|''Achtiname'' of Muhammad]], with Latin translation.

Finally, three small pamphlets appeared between 1640 and 1642, one in Latin and two in French, containing his defence in the actions of Le Jay and [[Antoine Vitré|Vitre]].

Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding [[King Arthur]]), are usually classified as [[cultural heritage]] or [[legend]]s, because they do not show the "disinterested investigation" required of the discipline of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Knowing Teaching and Learning History, National and International Perspectives |last= Seixas |first= Peter |editor= Peter N.

Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state [[chronicle]], the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts survived.

Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a [[Outline of academic disciplines#History|major discipline]] in university studies.

==Etymology==
[[File:History-Dielman-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|''History'' by [[Frederick Dielman]] (1896)]]
The word ''history'' comes ultimately from [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ἱστορία|ἱστορία]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(stori/a|ἱστορία}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''historía''), meaning "inquiry", "knowledge from inquiry", or "judge". It was in that sense that [[Aristotle]] used the word in his {{lang|grc|[[History of Animals|Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα Ἱστορίαι]]}}&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora"&gt;Ferrater-Mora, José. ''Diccionario de Filosofia''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Perì Tà Zôa Ηistoríai'' "Inquiries about Animals"). The ancestor word {{lang|grc|ἵστωρ}} is attested early on in [[Homeric Hymns]], [[Heraclitus]], the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[ephebos|ephebes]]' oath, and in [[Boeotia|Boiotic]] inscriptions (in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness", or similar).

The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as ''historia'', meaning "investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative". ''History'' was borrowed from Latin (possibly via [[Old Irish]] or [[Old Welsh]]) into [[Old English]] as ''stær'' ('history, narrative, story'), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"&gt;"history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, as Latin became [[Old French]] (and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]), ''historia'' developed into forms such as ''istorie'', ''estoire'', and ''historie'', with new developments in the meaning: "account of the events of a person's life (beginning of the 12th century), chronicle, account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events (c. 1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (c. 1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c. 1462)".&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

It was from Anglo-Norman that ''history'' was borrowed into [[Middle English]], and this time the loan stuck. It appears in the thirteenth-century ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'', but seems to have become a common word in the late fourteenth century, with an early attestation appearing in [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' of the 1390s (VI.1383): "I finde in a bok compiled | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire". In [[Middle English]], the meaning of ''history'' was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning "the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, esp. human affairs" arose in the mid-fifteenth century.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

With the [[Renaissance]], older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that [[Francis Bacon]] used the term in the late sixteenth century, when he wrote about "[[Natural history|Natural History]]". For him, ''historia'' was "the knowledge of objects determined by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by [[memory]] (while [[science]] was provided by [[reason]], and [[poetry]] was provided by [[fantasy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an expression of the linguistic [[Synthetic language|synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy]], English like Chinese (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and [[storytelling]] in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story".

The adjective ''historical'' is attested from 1661, and ''historic'' from 1669.&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;Whitney, W. D. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]''. New York: The Century Co, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Historian'' in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], the substantive "history" is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, "History", or the word ''[[historiography]]''.&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Historians' History of the World - Title Page.jpg|thumb|The title page to ''[[The Historians' History of the World]]'']]
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of [[Benedetto Croce]], "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by the formation of a "true discourse of past" through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Whitney, (1889). [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]. Page [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2842,M1 2842].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.

All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search – 3.0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917065532/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=17 September 2005 }}, "History".&lt;/ref&gt; The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the "true past").

The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the [[humanities]] and at other times as part of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Gordon and James Gordon Irving, ''The History and Philosophy of Social Science''. Routledge 1991. Page 1. {{ISBN|0-415-05682-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, H. (1986). Dictionary of concepts in history. Reference sources for the social sciences and humanities, no. 3. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Page 416.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, French [[historian]] [[Fernand Braudel]] revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[geography]] in the study of global history.

Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an [[oral tradition]], and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Lemon (1995). The Discipline of History and the History of Thought. Routledge. Page 201. {{ISBN|0-415-12346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.

[[Archaeology]] is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps" within textual sources. Indeed, "historical archaeology" is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical [[Annapolis, Maryland]], USA; has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time.

There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, [[culture|culturally]], territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in "The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975." It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called [[Big History]] resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or [[theory|theoretical]] aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and prehistory==
{{Human history and prehistory|250}}
{{Further|Protohistory}}

The [[history of the world]] is the memory of the past [[experience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1930&amp;dq=Jack+Goody+2007&amp;sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, British historian [[E. H. Carr]] wrote:
{{quote|The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p.108, {{ISBN|0-14-020652-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as [[Indigenous Australians]] and New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]] in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography}}
[[File:Guicciardini M Francesco La Historia dItalia.jpg|thumb|left|The title page to ''La Historia d'Italia'']]
Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of [[Historical method|methodology]] and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the [[Philosophy of history]]. As a [[meta-level]] analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, [[world view]], use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Historiography: Ancient, medieval, and modern'' (University of Chicago Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the twentieth century: From scientific objectivity to the postmodern challenge'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Philosophy of history}}
{{unreferenced section| date= January 2016}}
Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development—that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.

&lt;div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"&gt; Historical method basics &lt;/div&gt;

The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
# ''When was'' the source, written or unwritten, produced ([[Calendar date|date]])?
# Where was it produced ([[Internationalization and localization|localization]])?
# By whom was it produced ([[author]]ship)?
# From what pre-existing material was it produced ([[wikt:analysis|analysis]])?
# In what original form was it produced ([[integrity]])?
# What is the evidential value of its contents ([[credibility]])?
The first four are known as [[historical criticism]]; the fifth, [[textual criticism]]; and, together, external criticism. ''The sixth and final inquiry'' about a source is called internal criticism.

The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 BC – ca.425 BC)&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=5|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history". However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 BC – ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at [[Causality|cause and effect]], rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"/&gt; In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]], with events regularly recurring.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=6|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval [[China]]. The groundwork for professional historiography in [[East Asia]] was established by the [[Han dynasty]] court historian known as [[Sima Qian]] (145–90 BC), author of the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji''). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of [[Chinese historiography]]. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his ''Shiji'' as the official format for [[Twenty-Four Histories|historical texts]], as well as for biographical literature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[Secularity|secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"/&gt;

In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-01754-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systemic bias|systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is thus considered to be the "father of historiography"&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin Ahmed (1999).

W. Akhtar (1997). "The Islamic Concept of Knowledge", ''Al-Tawhid: A Quarterly Journal of Islamic Thought &amp; Culture'' '''12''' (3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany.

In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[Great Man theory|great men]], to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included [[Fernand Braudel]], [[E. H. Carr]], [[Fritz Fischer]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Bruce Trigger]], [[Marc Bloch]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Peter Gay]], [[Robert Fogel]], [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Lawrence Stone]]. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of [[digital history]] has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Donald Creighton]], [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] and [[Gerhard Ritter]] argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the [[imagination]], and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]] (cf. ''[[History of mentalities|histoire des mentalités]]''). Intellectual historians such as [[Herbert Butterfield]], [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[George Mosse]] have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of [[social history]] to emerge in the post-WWII era was ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Detlev Peukert]] sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] period.

[[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[Georges Lefebvre]], [[Eugene Genovese]], [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Timothy Mason]], [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Arno J. Mayer]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] have sought to validate [[Karl Marx]]'s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as [[François Furet]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[J. C. D. Clark]], [[Roland Mousnier]], [[Henry Ashby Turner]] and [[Robert Conquest]] have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. [[Feminism|Feminist]] historians such as [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Claudia Koonz]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Sheila Rowbotham]], [[Gisela Bock]], [[Gerda Lerner]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], and [[Lynn Hunt]] have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', [[Richard J. Evans]] defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]'s 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''.

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history}}
The [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist historiography]] was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail M. Krom, "From the Center to the Margin: the Fate of Marxism in Contemporary Russian Historiography," ''Storia della Storiografia'' (2012) Issue 62, pp 121-130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Periods===
{{Main|Periodization}}
Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these [[Periodization|periods of time]] names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.&lt;ref name="Marwick-p169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of History |author=Marwick, Arthur|publisher=The Macmillan Press LTD |year=1970 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period. [[Century|Centuries]] and [[decade]]s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the [[Calendar era|dating system]] used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.&lt;ref name="Tosh-p168-169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|author=Tosh, John|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2006 |pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prehistoric periodisation====
The field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. The usual method for periodisation of the distant [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] past, in [[archaeology]] is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains. Here prehistory is divided into a series of "chapters" so that periods in history could unfold not only in a relative chronology but also narrative chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Time|last=Lucas|first=Gavin|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0415311977|location=Oxon|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This narrative content could be in the form of functional-economic interpretation. There are periodisation, however, that do not have this narrative aspect, relying largely on relative chronology and, thus, devoid of any specific meaning.

Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through [[radiocarbon dating]] and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used. Periodisation, however, is not viewed as a perfect framework with one account explaining that "cultural changes do not conveniently start and stop (combinedly) at periodisation boundaries" and that different trajectories of change are also needed to be studied in their own right before they get intertwined with cultural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Living Landscape: Bronze Age Settlement Sites in the Dutch River Area (C. 2000-800 BC)|last=Arnoldussen|first=Stijn|publisher=Sidestone Press|year=2007|isbn=9789088900105|location=Leiden|pages=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Geographical locations===
Particular [[Geography|geographical]] locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, [[continent]]s, [[Country|countries]], and [[City|cities]]. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to [[geography]]. According to [[Jules Michelet]] in his book ''Histoire de France'' (1833), "without geographical basis, the people, the makers of history, seem to be walking on air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Relations of History and Geography: Studies in England, France and the United States|last=Darby|first=Henry Clifford|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=2002|isbn=0859896994|location=Exeter|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the [[geography of Egypt]] is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization. There is also the case of climate, which historians like [[Ellsworth Huntington]] and Allen Semple, cited as a crucial influence on the course of history and racial temperament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World history from early times to A D 2000|last=Rao|first=B.V.|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

====Regions====
* [[History of Africa]] begins with the first emergence of modern human beings on the continent, continuing into its modern present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.
* [[History of the Americas]] is the collective history of North and South America, including Central America and the Caribbean.
** [[History of North America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's northern and western hemisphere.
** [[History of Central America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's western hemisphere.
** [[History of the Caribbean]] begins with the oldest evidence where 7,000-year-old remains have been found.
** [[History of South America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's southern and western hemisphere.
* [[History of Antarctica]] emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, known as Terra Australis, believed to exist in the far south of the globe.
* [[History of Australia]] starts with the documentation of the Makassar trading with Indigenous Australians on Australia's north coast.
* [[History of New Zealand]] dates back at least 700 years to when it was discovered and settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct Māori culture centred on kinship links and land.
* [[History of the Pacific Islands]] covers the history of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.
* [[History of Eurasia]] is the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions: the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe, linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.
** [[History of Europe]] describes the passage of time from humans inhabiting the European continent to the present day.
** [[History of Asia]] can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe.
*** [[History of East Asia]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in East Asia.
*** [[History of the Middle East]] begins with the earliest civilizations in the region now known as the Middle East that were established around 3000 BC, in Mesopotamia (Iraq).
*** [[History of India]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in the Sub-Himalayan region.
*** [[History of Southeast Asia]] has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers.

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}

[[Military history]] concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat. The "new military history" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.&lt;ref name=Pavkovic&gt;{{Cite book | last =Pavkovic

===History of religion===
{{Main|History of religions}}

The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include ''[[Church History (journal)|Church History]]'', ''[[The Catholic Historical Review]]'', and ''[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]]''. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Cochrane |title=What Is Catholic Historiography? |journal=Catholic Historical Review |volume=61 |issue=2 |year=1975 |pages=169–190 |jstor=25019673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.&lt;ref&gt;For example see {{cite journal |first=Sofia Boesch |last=Gajano |first2=Tommaso |last2=Caliò |title=Italian Religious Historiography in the 1990s |journal=Journal of Modern Italian Studies |year=1998 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=293–306 |jstor= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social history===
{{Main|Social history}}
''Social history'', sometimes called the ''new social history'', is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stearns, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Social History'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security'', Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%)  identified themselves with social history while [[political history]] came next with 1425 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html Teachers of History in the Universities of the UK 2007 - listed by research interest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530073940/http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html |date=30 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "old" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great Man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=978-0-582-48488-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=978-0-300-14424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subfields====
The chief subfields of social history include:
* [[Demographic history]]
* [[History of education]]
* [[Ethnic history]]
* [[History of the family]]
* [[Labor history (discipline)|Labour history]]
* [[Rural history]]
* [[Urban history]]
** [[American urban history]]
* [[Women's history]]
Smaller specialties include:
* [[History of childhood]]
* [[Gender history]]

===Cultural history===
{{Main|Cultural history}}
Cultural history replaced [[social history]] as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
Cultural history includes the study of [[History of art|art in society]] as well is the study of images and human visual production ([[iconography]]).&lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), "Dictionnaire mondial des images", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, {{ISBN|978-2-84736-185-8}}.

===Diplomatic history===
{{Main|Diplomatic history}}
[[Diplomatic history]]  focuses on the relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars. More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of ''political history'' is the study of the conduct of [[International relations#History|international relations]] between states or across state boundaries over time. Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War, "diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies."&lt;ref&gt;Muriel E Chamberlain, ''Pax Britannica'? British Foreign Policy 1789–1914'' (1988) p 1&lt;/ref&gt; She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.

===Economic history===
{{main|Economic history|Business history}}
Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, "Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study?," Historically Speaking (April 2010) v. 11#2 pp 17-20, with responses pp 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business history]]  deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history; Business history is most often taught in business schools.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Amatori, and Geoffrey Jones, eds. ''Business History Around the World'' (2003) [https://www.questia.com/read/114846992 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental history===
{{main|Environmental history}}
Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Hughes, ''What is Environmental History'' (2006) [https://www.amazon.com/What-Environmental-History/dp/0745631886/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World history===
{{main|World history}}
{{See also|History of the world|Universal history}}
World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ainslie Embree]] and Carol Gluck, eds., ''Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching''  (M.E. Sharpe, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Japan&lt;ref&gt;Shigeru Akita, "World History and the Emergence of Global History in Japan,"''Chinese Studies in History'', Spring 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 84-96&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.

It has led to highly controversial interpretations by [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], among others.

The World History Association publishes the ''Journal of World History'' every quarter since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501050602/http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The H-World discussion list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~world/|title=H-World - H-Net|website=www.h-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.

===People's history===
{{Main|People's history}}
A [[people's history]] is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the [[Populism|perspective of common people]]. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the [[nonconformist]]s, and the otherwise forgotten people. The authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the [[History Workshop Journal|History Workshop]] movement in Britain in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wade Matthews|title=The New Left, National Identity, and the Break-up of Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfmZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|pages=20–21|isbn=9789004253070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual history===
{{Main|Intellectual history|History of ideas}}
Intellectual history and the history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with a career of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony |last=Grafton |title=The History of Ideas: Precept and Practice, 1950–2000 and beyond |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=67 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=1–32 |url=http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Maryanne Cline |editor-last=Horowitz |title=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas |volume=6 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender history===
{{Main|Gender history}}
[[Gender history]] is a sub-field of History and [[Gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.

===Public history===
{{Main|Public history}}
[[Public history]] describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;David Glassberg, "Public history and the study of memory." ''The Public Historian'' (1996): 7-23. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377910 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events.They discover this information through archaeological evidence, written primary sources from the past and other various means such as place names. In [[list of historians|lists of historians]], historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. [[Chronicle]]rs and [[annals|annalists]], though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.

==The judgement of history==
{{see also|Ash heap of history}}
Since the 20th century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the "judgement of history."&lt;ref name="Curran2000p413"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413 pp.413-5]&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of [[Judgment (law)|legal judgement]]s, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.&lt;ref name="Curran2000p415"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415 p.415]&lt;/ref&gt; A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of [[collective memory]].

==Pseudohistory==
{{Main|Pseudohistory}}

[[Pseudohistory]] is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard [[Historical method|historiographical conventions]] in a way which undermines their conclusions.
Closely related to deceptive [[Historical negationism|historical revisionism]], works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.

==Teaching history==

===Scholarship vs teaching===
A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor [[Charles Harding Firth]], Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defence of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools, such as Manchester University, where [[Thomas Frederick Tout]] was professionalizing the History undergraduate programme by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Roots, "Firth, Sir Charles Harding (1857–1936)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33137, Online; accessed 10 Nov 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reba Soffer, "Nation, duty, character and confidence: history at Oxford, 1850–1914." ''Historical Journal'' (1987) 30#01 pp: 77-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, scholarship was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Donoghue, ''The Last Professors: The Corporate University and the Fate of the Humanities'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980, attention increasingly moved toward teaching [[world history]] or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Swansinger, "Preparing Student Teachers for a World History Curriculum in New York," ''History Teacher'', (November 2009), 43#1 pp 87-96&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.

The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the ''[[Nouvelle histoire]]'' as disseminated after the 1960s by ''Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement'' and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote "active methods" which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery." Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Abby Waldman, " The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s," ''History Workshop Journal''  Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199-221  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v068/68.waldman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias in school teaching===

In several countries history textbooks are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Nicholls, ed. ''School History Textbooks across Cultures: International Debates and Perspectives'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favourable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the [[Nanking Massacre]] has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schneider, "The Japanese History Textbook Controversy in East Asian Perspective," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', May 2008, Vol. 617, pp 107-122&lt;/ref&gt; It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;"Problems of Teaching Contemporary Russian History," ''Russian Studies in History'', Winter 2004, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Blackwell-Synergy.com |journal=International Affairs |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=365–370 |doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00708.x|year = 2008|last1 = Wedgwood Benn|first1 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], especially the [[Southern United States|southern part]] history about [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[American Civil War]] are controversial topics. [[McGraw-Hill Education]] for example, was criticised for describing Africans brought to American plantations as "workers" instead of slaves in a textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernandez|first1=Manny|last2=Hauser|first2=Christine|date=5 October 2015|title=Texas Mother Teaches Textbook Company a Lesson on Accuracy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/publisher-promises-revisions-after-textbook-refers-to-african-slaves-as-workers.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.&lt;ref&gt;"Teaching History in Schools: the Politics of Textbooks in India," ''History Workshop Journal'', April 2009, Issue 67, pp 99-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Volodina, "Teaching History in Russia After the Collapse of the USSR," ''History Teacher'', February 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp 179-188&lt;/ref&gt;

In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an "almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects "principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace."  The result is that "German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."&lt;ref&gt;Simone Lässig and Karl Heinrich Pohl, "History Textbooks and Historical Scholarship in Germany," ''History Workshop Journal'' Issue 67, Spring 2009 pp 128-9 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v067/67.lassig.html online at project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human Rights and Climate Change''' is a conceptual and legal framework under which international [[human rights]] and their relationship to [[global warming]] are studied, analyzed, and addressed. The framework has been employed by governments, [[United Nations]] organizations, [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] and [[non-governmental organizations]], human rights and environmental advocates, and academics to guide national and international policy on climate change under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and the core [[international human rights instruments]].
	
	Human rights and climate change analysis focuses on the anticipated consequences to humans associated with global environmental phenomena including [[sea level rise]], [[desertification]], temperature increases, extreme weather events, and changes in precipitation, as well as [[climate change adaptation|adaptation]] and [[climate change mitigation|mitigation]] measures taken by governments in response to those phenomena that may involve human rights or related legal protections.

==History==
In 2005, Inuit activist [[Sheila Watt-Cloutier]] filed a petition to the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] seeking relief "from human rights violations resulting from the impacts of global warming and climate change caused by acts and omissions of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Petition to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights Seeking Relief from Violations Resulting from Global Warming Caused by Acts and Omissions of the United States|date=7 December 2005|url=http://www.inuitcircumpolar.com/files/uploads/icc-files/FINALPetitionICC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was rejected, but the Commission invited and heard testimony on the relationship between human rights and climate change from representatives for the Inuit in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sieg|first=Richard|title=At International Commission, Inuit Want to See Change in U.S. Policy on Global Warming|url=http://www.vjel.org/news/NEWS100058.html|accessdate=25 April 2012|date=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, the Malé Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change "stated explicitly (and for the first time in an international agreement) that 'climate change has clear and immediate implications for the full enjoyment of human rights' and called on the United Nations human rights system to address the issue as a matter of urgency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Limon|first=Marc|title=HUMAN RIGHTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE: CONSTRUCTING A CASE FOR POLITICAL ACTION|journal=Harvard Environmental Law Review|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=439–476|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/elr/vol33_2/Limon.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Malé Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change|date=14 November 2007|url=http://www.ciel.org/Publications/Male_Declaration_Nov07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council#Climate change|UN Human Rights Council]] (HRC) unanimously adopted Resolution 7/23, recognizing that "climate change poses an immediate and far-reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has implications for the full enjoyment of human rights," and citing the [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 7/23, Human rights and climate change|date=28 March 2008|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_7_23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HRC reaffirmed and expanded these statements with resolutions 10/4 of 25 March 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 10/4, Human rights and climate change|date=25 March 2009|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_10_4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 18/22 of 30 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=A/HRC/RES/18/22 Human rights and climate change|date=30 September 2011|url=http://daccess-ods.un.org/TMP/6246410.01224518.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) released an analytical study identifying specific rights and people groups likely to be adversely affected by climate disruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=OHCHR|title=Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights|date=15 January 2009|issue=A/HRC/10/61|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/103/44/PDF/G0910344.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report drew on the submissions of some 30 nations as well as ten [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|United Nations Agencies]] and dozens of other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=OHCHR|title=OHCHR study on the relationship between climate change and human rights: Submissions and reference documents received|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/HRAndClimateChange/Pages/Submissions.aspx|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report identified displaced persons, conflict and security risks as well as impaired rights of indigenous peoples, women, and children as major concerns.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite journal|title=Report|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/103/44/PDF/G0910344.pdf?OpenElement}}, n.8, at 15-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I, Annex II countries and developing countries|Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC]] reproduced the HRC's language identifying the relationship between human rights and climate change in its report on the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Cancun]], Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conference of the Parties|title=FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, Report of the Conference of the Parties on its sixteenth session, held in Cancun from 29 November to 10 December 2010, Addendum, Part Two: Action taken by the Conference of the Parties at its sixteenth session|date=15 March 2011|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report on the outcome of the Conference emphasized that "Parties should, in all climate change related actions, fully respect human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Id.''|journal=Decision 1/CP.16, The Cancun Agreements:  Outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention|date=15 March 2011|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years have seen an increased recognition of the link between human rights and the environment, yet there are still many questions surrounding the relationship between them. As a result, in 2012 the HRC established a mandate on human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 19/10, Human rights and the environment|date=19 April 2012|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/G12/131/59/PDF/G1213159.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary report by the appointed Independent Expert, John H. Knox, further stated that there needed to be priority in providing greater conceptual clarity to the application of human rights obligations related to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment|date=24 December 2012|issue=A/HRC/22/43|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A-HRC-22-43_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, all 78 of the United Nations Special Procedures Mandate Holders issued a joint statement on [[Human Rights Day]] calling for states to incorporate their existing obligations under the human rights framework into climate change negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15393&amp;|title=OHCHR {{!}} Statement of the United Nations Special Procedures Mandate Holders on the occasion of the Human Rights Day Geneva, 10 December 2014|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have the effect of bringing the rights of those affected by climate change to the forefront of all response strategies. 

As of March 2015, there is now a [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on human rights and the environment, an extension of the mandate of the former Independent Expert on human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 28/11, Human rights and the environment|date=7 April 2015|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G15/071/78/PDF/G1507178.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris, the Special Rapporteur informed states that they should ensure their human rights obligations encompass the appropriate perspective towards climate change when negotiating future agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16836&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR {{!}} COP21: "States’ human rights obligations encompass climate change" – UN expert|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paris Agreement''', as adopted on the 12 December 2015 at the Conference of the Parties, is the most important indication of increasing awareness towards the relationship between climate change and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment|date=1 February 2016|issue=A/HRC/31/52|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2729611}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Agreement is the first climate agreement to recognise the relevance of human rights, stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNFCCC|date=12 December 2015|title=Adoption of the Paris Agreement|url=https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf|issue=FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Human rights law and climate change ==
Climate change is inducing not only ecological adjustments, but is also impacting the social, economic, political, cultural and legal aspects of societies around the world. The HRC has affirmed that human rights obligations have the ability to strengthen both international and national policy-making in the area of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 10/4, Human rights and climate change|date=25 March 2009|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_10_4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Declaration]] provided the basis for further elaboration of a human right to environmental quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/271647969|title=International law and the environment|last=W.|first=Birnie, Patricia|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Boyle, Alan E., Redgwell, Catherine.|isbn=9780198764229|edition=3rd|location=Oxford|oclc=271647969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental protection is not commonly included in human rights treaties. Rather environmental protection is derived from the rights that those treaties protect, such as the rights to life, food and water and health.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/724352139|title=Human rights and climate change : a review of the international legal dimensions.|last=1974-|first=McInerney-Lankford, Siobhán Alice,|date=2011|publisher=World Bank|others=Darrow, Mac., Rajamani, Lavanya., World Bank.|isbn=9780821387207|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=724352139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving forward, human rights law in the context of climate change policy-making may help to establish minimum standards of basic human rights that can be adopted in international and national mitigation and adaption measures.

==Rights implicated==
	Most international statements on human rights and climate change have emphasized the potential adverse impacts of climate change on the rights to [[right to life|life]], [[right to food|food]], [[right to water|water]], [[right to health|health]], [[right to housing|housing]], [[right to development|development]], and [[right to self-determination|self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Malé Declaration, n.4; UNHRC Resolution 18/22, n.7; A/HRC/10/61, n.8; FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, n.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human rights, climate change and cross-border displacement|url = http://www.universal-rights.org/urg-policy-reports/human-rights-climate-change-and-cross-border-displacement-the-role-of-the-international-human-rights-community-in-contributing-to-effective-and-just-solutions/|website = Universal Rights Group|access-date = 2016-02-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights are enumerated in the core conventions of [[international human rights law]], though not all HRC members or UNFCCC parties are signatories of these conventions.

=== Right to life ===
The right to life is protected by Article 6 of the ICCPR where every human being has the inherent right to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=OHCRC|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|date=23 March 1976|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/ccpr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to life is inextricably linked to the measure of fulfilment of other rights. There are both projected and observed effects that climate change will have on the right to life. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] ('''IPCC''') [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|fourth assessment report]] projected an increase in people suffering from death and injury occurring from an increase in floods, storms, heatwaves, fires and droughts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights|date=15 January 2009|issue=A/HRC/10/61|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Press/AnalyticalStudy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change will equally affect the right to life through an increase in hunger and malnutrition and related disorder impacting child growth and development, respiratory morbidity and ground-level ozone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rising sea levels is one of the flow-on effects of climate change, resulting from warming water and melting ice sheets.  Measuring sea level rise is a complicated affair, however the IPCC have projected an increase in global mean sea level&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sealevel.colorado.edu/content/what-definition-global-mean-sea-level-gmsl-and-its-rate|title=What is the definition of global mean sea level (GMSL) and its rate? {{!}} CU Sea Level Research Group|website=sealevel.colorado.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; of between 0.44m and 0.74m by 2100.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=IPCC|first=|date=2007|title=Fourth Assessment Report|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_full_report.pdf|journal=|volume=|issue=AR4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For low-lying coastal islands such as Male', in the Maldives, a sea level rise of 0.5 metres would inundate 15 per cent of the island by 2025, and flood half of it by 2100.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As 42 per cent of the population lives within 100m within the coastline, even partial flooding is likely to result in drowning, injury and loss of life.

Observed effects are those where the right to life has already inhibited the right to life. There is difficulty in studying the impacts of climate change itself because of the issue of scale; climate change is measured in decades.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is more than 95 per cent chance that [[anthropogenic climate change]] quadrupled the risk of extreme summer heat events in Europe in the decade 1998 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christidis|first=Nikolaos|last2=Stott|first2=Peter A.|last3=Jones|first3=Gareth S.|last4=Shiogama|first4=Hideo|last5=Nozawa|first5=Toru|last6=Luterbacher|first6=Jürg|date=2012-02-01|title=Human activity and anomalously warm seasons in Europe|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.2262/abstract|journal=International Journal of Climatology|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=225–239|doi=10.1002/joc.2262|issn=1097-0088}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a probability of 75 per cent that the 2003 heat wave in Europe was attributable to climate change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On this basis, the excess mortality rate from this event registered at 15,000 deaths in France alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fouillet|first=A.|last2=Rey|first2=G.|last3=Laurent|first3=F.|last4=Pavillon|first4=G.|last5=Bellec|first5=S.|last6=Guihenneuc-Jouyaux|first6=C.|last7=Clavel|first7=J.|last8=Jougla|first8=E.|last9=Hémon|first9=Denis|title=Excess mortality related to the August 2003 heat wave in France|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00420-006-0089-4|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health|language=en|volume=80|issue=1|pages=16–24|doi=10.1007/s00420-006-0089-4|issn=0340-0131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to food ===
This is derived from Article II of the ICESCR where States party to the Covenant have to maximise their available resources to the achieve the right to adequate food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}: article 2(1), 11(1) and 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change is going to affect all four pillars of [[food security]]; availability, access, utilization and stability. A 2008 report by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food has stated that the way the world grows food will have to undergo radical change to cope with a growing population and the effects of climate change, while avoiding environmental collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Schutter|first=Olivier|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Building resilience: a human rights framework for world food and nutrition security |date=8 September 2008|issue=A/HRC/9/23|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/food/docs/A.HRC.9.23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Agreement recognises the fundamental priority of ensuring food security and the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Article 2 calls for adaption to the adverse impacts of climate change and the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions in a manner that will not threaten food production.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The IPCC fourth assessment report projects that food production will increase in the mid to high latitudes with a temperature increase of between 1° and 3&amp;nbsp;°C, however at lower latitudes crop productivity is set to decrease which increases the risk of food insecurity in poorer regions of the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]] estimate an additional 600 million people will face malnutrition due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNDP|first=|date=2007|title=Fighting climate change: Human solidarity in a divided world|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/corporate/HDR/2006%20Global%20HDR/HDR-2006-Beyond%20scarcity-Power-poverty-and-the-global-water-crisis.pdf|journal=Human Development Report|volume=|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely to have a particularly devastating effect on Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=IPCC|title=Working Group II Report|date=2007|issue=AR4|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4_wg2_full_report.pdf|pages=275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to water ===
The [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ('''CESCR''') notes that the right to water is not only an essential condition to survival, but also that it is inextricably linked with other rights, such as; [[right to housing|housing]], [[right to health|attainable standard of health]], [[right to an adequate standard of living|adequate standard of living]], and [[right to food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=CESCR|title=General Comment No. 15: The Right to Water (Arts. 11 and 12 of the Covenant)  |date=20 January 2003|issue=E/C.12/2002/11|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4538838d11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stern Review]] states that people will feel the effects of climate change the most strongly through changes in patterns of water distribution around the globe.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006-12-01|title=The Stern Review on the Economic Effects of Climate Change|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00153.x/abstract|journal=Population and Development Review|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00153.x|issn=1728-4457|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those areas that are already experiencing dry conditions will experience a further decrease in water availability, with several (but not all) climate models predicting up to a 30 per cent decrease in annual run-off in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of southern Africa and South America for a 2&amp;nbsp;°C global temperature rise, and 40 – 50 per cent for 4&amp;nbsp;°C rise.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/652432164|title=Human rights and climate change|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Humphreys, Stephen.|year=|isbn=9780521762762|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=652432164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|IPCC fifth assessment report]] states that freshwater-related risks increase significantly with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, with climate change over the 21st century projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources significantly in most dry subtropical regions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=IPCC|first=|date=2014|title=IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf|journal=|volume=AR5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to health ===
Article 12 of the '''ICESCR''' identifies the "right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most national constitutions protect the right to health in some manner, and it is widely safeguarded in other international and regional instruments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Rights and Climate Change : A Review of the International Legal Dimensions|last1=McInerney-Lankford|first1=Siobhan|last2=Darrow|first2=Mac|last3=Rajamani|first3=Lavanya|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=2011|isbn=9780821387207|location=|pages=|at=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change is going to amplify health disparities between the rich and poor in different parts of the world. The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] ('''WHO''') estimates that since 1970, climate change is responsible for 150,000 deaths every year through increasing incidence in the spread of diarrhoea, malaria and malnutrition predominantly in Africa and other developing regions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Just a 1&amp;nbsp;°C increase in global temperature from pre-industrial levels could double the annual deaths from climate change (according to WHO).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Specific issues==

===Displacement===
Potential climate induced migration is currently one of the most disputed flow-on effects from climate change. Research suggests that climate change may create some 50 to 200 million new [[internally displaced persons]] and international [[refugees]] by the year 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Docherty|first=Bonnie|author2=Tyler Giannini|title=Confronting a Rising Tide: A Proposal for a Convention on Climage Change Refugees|journal=Harvard Environmental Law Review|year=2009|volume=33|pages=349–403|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/elr/vol33_2/Docherty%20Giannini.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mega-deltas" in Asia, Africa, and small islands are at high risk of floods and storms, which will cause large-scale displacement of the local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/displacement-caused-by-the-effects-of-climate-change-who-will-be-affected-and-what-are-the-gaps-in-the-normative-framework-for-their-protection/|title=Displacement Caused by the Effects of Climate Change: Who Will Be Affected and What Are the Gaps in the Normative Framework for Their Protection? {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2017-02-16|newspaper=Brookings|access-date=2017-02-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change induced migration will either affect or violate basic international human right norms.

=== Climate justice ===
There is significant discussion around the concept of climate justice for the [[environmental migrant]] or 'climate refugee'. This concept aims to fill a gap in the legal and political sectors for the millions of people that are not able to receive international legal protection as this source of migration is yet to be included in regional and international law.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987699915|title=Climate change, migration and human rights law and policy perspectives|others=Manou, Dimitra,, Baldwin, Andrew, 1970-, Cubie, Dug,, Mihr, Anja, 1969-, Thorp, Teresa M., 1968-|isbn=9781317222330|location=London|oclc=987699915}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently no established definition for who can be classified as a climate refugee because it has not yet been enshrined in international law. In 2014 Siego Alesana left the [[Small Island Developing States|small island developing state]] of [[Tuvalu]] because of the uncertainty surrounding the adverse effects of climate change.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|title=AD (Tuvalu )|date=4 June 2014|url=http://www.nzlii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/nz/cases/NZIPT/2014/501370.html?query=AD%20(Tuvalu)|issue=501370|accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvalu is only 4.6m above sea level and faces the imminent danger posed by rising sea levels. Although the impacts of climate change were put forward on behalf of Alesana and his family, the case rested largely on humanitarian grounds. However the [[Immigration and Protection Tribunal]] did state that environmental degradation caused by climate change was already a feature of life in Tuvalu.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Although this decision wasn't based on impacts of climate change that is not to say that climate change related factors weren't taken into consideration at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vernonrive.com/home/climate-refugees-revisited-a-closer-look-at-the-tuvalu-decision|title="Climate refugees" revisited: a closer look at the Tuvalu decision|website=Vernon Rive|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Migration]] has put forward a working definition of environmental migrant:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iom.int/definitional-issues|title=Definitional Issues|date=2015-01-29|work=International Organization for Migration|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, predominantly for reasons of sudden or progressive change in the environment that adversely affects their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move within their country or abroad.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Until there is a legally binding definition of what constitutes an environmental migrant, it will be difficult for any true justice to be served. The concept of climate justice would see all human rights implemented in the most transparent way in order to maintain basic standards in the face of the somewhat unknown impacts that will be created by climate change.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Conflict===
International peacebuilding NGO [[International Alert]] names 46 countries where climate change effects (including water scarcity, loss of arable land, extreme weather events, shortened growing seasons, and melting glaciers) may interact with economic, social, and political forces to create "a high risk of violent conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dan|author2=Janani Vivekananda|title=A CLIMATE OF CONFLICT: The links between climate change, peace and war|journal=International Alert|date=November 2007|url=http://www.international-alert.org/sites/default/files/publications/A_climate_of_conflict.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous peoples===
[[Indigenous peoples]] have a unique position when it comes to discussion of the impacts climate change will have on a population. Many indigenous populations live subsistence lifestyles, which in turn are disrupted severely when it comes to the impact of climate change. In many countries, municipal law differs in application to indigenous peoples than the rest of the population which complicates any legal remedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811732784|title=Climate change and Indigenous peoples : the search for legal remedies|date=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar|others=Abate, Randall., Kronk, Elizabeth Ann.|isbn=9781783474172|location=Cheltenham, UK|oclc=811732784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change impacts indigenous peoples differently not only because of their physical and spiritual connections to the land and water, but also because they have a specialised ecological and traditional knowledge that can be used to find the best mitigation strategy of those effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerrard|first=Emily|date=2008|title=Climate change and human rights : issues and opportunities for Indigenous peoples|url=|journal=University of New South Wales Law Journal|volume=31|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN Human Rights organs have identified the [[rights of indigenous peoples]] as particularly vulnerable to the disruptive effects of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;OHCHR: Climate change and indigenous peoples, http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/ClimateChangeIP.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hampson|first=Françoise|title=THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN STATES AND TERRITORIES THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS|date=13 July 2004|issue=E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/2004/CRP.1|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/IPeoples/WG/crp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to climate change, indigenous people have been threatened with their livelihood and cultural idententies across the world North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Approximately 370 million indigenous people are affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Jay|date=2012-05-01|title=The impact of climate change on indigenous people – the implications for the cultural, spiritual, economic and legal rights of indigenous people|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13642987.2011.632135|journal=The International Journal of Human Rights|volume=16|issue=4|pages=648–688|doi=10.1080/13642987.2011.632135|issn=1364-2987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child Rights===
Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] identified that children in South Asia may be particularly vulnerable to violations of human rights following climate related disasters. These can include gender-based violence, child labour, family break-ups and barriers to their development and learning. The researchers argue that [[child rights]] are rarely prioritised in policies to reduce disaster risk or adapt to climate change and that [[climate change adaptation]] policies must tailor interventions to address critical aspects of child rights, particularly child protection and education.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Harris and Kelly Hawrylyshyn, Climate extremes and child rights in South Asia: a neglected priority, http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/7832.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Given that many of the world's poorest citizens depend directly on the environment for all or part of their daily livelihoods, many international development agencies see climate change and development as "inextricably linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=U.S. Agency for International Development|title=Integrating Climate Change into Development|date=November 2008|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACM036.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|author2=The World Bank|title=DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE A Strategic Framework for the World Bank Group|year=2008|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTCC/Resources/407863-1219339233881/DCCSFTechnicalReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khoday|first=Kishan|title=Climate Change and the Right to Development.

'''Iran computer and video games foundation''' ''(AKA Iran National Foundation of Computer Games or shortly IRCG)'' is a [[non-profit]], [[Semi-government]]al organization established in 2007 to control and support video game industry in Iran.

Iran computer and video games foundation is responsible for publishing and releasing any kind of [[video game]]s (including PC games and mobile games), supporting local game manufacturers, instructing students in video game development and organize, control and monitor the activities of [[LAN gaming center]]s in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldboy.com/irans-national-foundation-of-computer-games-to-organize-game-centers/242/|title=Iran's National Foundation of Computer Games to Organize Game Centers  –  Herald Boy|website=www.heraldboy.com|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRCG is also responsible for banning foreign video games that are not compatible with Iran’s governmental political views and filtering video game’s websites that they might not meet the governmental rules of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/300689/Iran-plans-to-block-websites-offering-1979-Revolution|title=Iran plans to block websites offering "1979 Revolution"|date=2016-04-17|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/pc-game-1979-revolution-black-friday-banned-iran-accused-hostile-intentions-1564600|title=Acclaimed PC game banned in Iran due to "hostile intentions"|date=2016-06-09|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Thomson''' (1852–1927)&lt;ref name=Archive&gt;{{cite web|title=MS 112 Papers relating to James Thomson, City Engineer, City Architect and Housing Director, Dundee|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%27MS%20112%27%29|work=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the City Engineer, City Architect, and Housing Director of [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]]. He originally planned an immense [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] style [[Civic Centre]] covering the [[City Centre, Dundee|centre of Dundee]]. At the onset of [[First World War]], his plans were scaled down and he retired in 1924.

Thomson was the designer behind the "Kingsway" City Bypass, combined road widening and [[slum clearance]], the Craigie Garden City Estate and the first ever district heated housing scheme at [[Logie, Dundee|Logie]]. After Thomson's death in 1927 his former assistant, [[James MacLellan Brown]], as Deputy City Architect, remodelled Burnet's designs in 1931.

==Early life==
[[File:Caird Hall and Caird Hall Square, Dundee.jpg|thumb|350px|Thomson's magnum opus - Caird Hall and Caird Hall Square, Dundee]]
A native of [[Edinburgh]], he got professional training in [[Architecture]] and [[Civil Engineering]]. As a young man, he came to Dundee to join the staff of the Burgh [[Surveying|Surveyor]]. Soon after taking the duty he was employed in connection with major schemes then being executed under the Improvement Act of 1871. Those undertakings, which, to a large extent, transformed the [[City Centre, Dundee|central area of the city]], were carried under his personal supervision. The construction of the Perth Road and the first [[tram]]way lines in Dundee were accomplished under his direction.

==Career==
Thomson became the Assistant Burgh Engineer after the constructions of Perth Road and tramlines. After the death of William Alexander, he was appointed as City Architect, and in August 1906, he was given the post of City Engineer in succession to Mackison, becoming, in pursuance of the Council’s Policy of Consolidation, the joint holder of the offices of City Architect and Engineer.

In October 1922, the [[Politics of Dundee|Town Council]] decided to separate the offices of City Engineering and City Architect, which the latter office embraced the duties of Housing Director. Thomson was relieved of the office of City Engineer and became City Architect and Housing Director.

Thomson retired in May 1924, but was retained in the capacity and continued to engage in professional life in association with his son Frank Thomson. He spent 55 years in the service of the corporation. His fondest hope and expressed desire was to have the [[City Centre, Dundee|Caird Hall Square]] completed "in his time".&lt;ref&gt;Obituary Report, James Thomson, Dundee Public Library Archive, 10 November 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visionary==
The media referred to Thomson as the "creator of innumerable schemes to make Dundee the City Beautiful."&lt;ref name="planning1927"&gt;The Courier, Pioneer in Town Planning Mr. James Thomson Dies in Caird Hall, Friday 10 November 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson’s report on the development of the city issued in 1918 was an example of his visions and daring conceptions. He was the man behind the construction of Kingsway City [[Bypass (road)|Bypass]], combined road widening and [[slum]] clearance, which was proposed, "…so that the city might expand advantageously and scientifically and get away from the old fashioned methods."&lt;ref name="planning1927"/&gt; He planned the Craigie Garden City Estate and the first ever district heated housing scheme at [[Logie, Dundee|Logie]].Thomson's ideas for extending [[City Centre, Dundee|City Square]] were developed again in 1924, when the [[École des Beaux-Arts|Ecole de Beaux Arts]] trained [[John James Burnet|Sir John James Burnet]] was commissioned to produce designs for the east and west wings to [[Town square|City Square]].

==Death ==
On 10 November 1927, in one of the corridors of the City Chambers, [[Caird Hall]], Thomson collapsed and died. A woman who had been waiting to see the [[Lord Provost]] saw him fall in the main corridor. She informed Lord Provost High and S. G. Fraser, with whom he was engaged at the moment, and they ran to his assistance. Thomson made a vain effort to speak but died in the arms of Fraser. Dr. Hunter, who was called, certified that the death to have been due to [[heart failure]].
At the time of death he was engaged on some of the minor details relating to the scheme for the erection of the East Wing. His funeral took palace in [[Balgay]] Cemetery on 14 November 1927.&lt;ref&gt;The Courier, Funeral of Mr. James Thomson, Nove. 15, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:0 21 080331 gold necklace.jpg|thumb|right|Gold necklace recovered from Jiskairumoko]]
'''Jisk'a Iru Muqu''' ([[Aymara language|Aymara]], ''jisk'a'' small, ''iru'' a type of grass, ''(Festuca orthophylla)'', ''muqu'' knot; joint of a part of the [[Phragmites|reed]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref Bertonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; also spelled ''Jiskairumoko, Jisk'airumoko'') is a [[pre-Columbian]] archaeological site {{convert|54|km|mi|0|sp=us}} south-east of [[Puno]], [[Peru]]. The site lies in the mountains at elevation 4,115&amp;nbsp;meters (13,500&amp;nbsp;feet), in the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] community of Jachacachi, adjacent to the Ilave River drainage, of the [[Lake Titicaca|Lake Titicaca Basin]], Peru. Occupation of Jisk'a Iru Muqu spans from the Late [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] to the [[Formative stage|Formative]].

==Research==
The site was first formally recorded by [[Mark Aldenderfer]] in 1994, during a pedestrian [[archaeological field survey|survey]] of the Ilave River. The first [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] at the site were conducted in 1995.&lt;ref name=Aldenderfer_de_la_Vega1996&gt;Aldenderfer and de la Vega (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Jisk'a Iru Muqu is the first Archaic open-air site excavated in the [[Lake Titicaca|Lake Titicaca Basin]]. Under the direction of Aldenderfer, a team from [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], including Nathan Craig and Nicholas Tripcevich, conducted additional excavations at the site during the austral winters of 1999-2004. In-field [[geographic information system]] (GIS) methods were 
[http://www.archaeo.info/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Archaeo-Photomapping used in recording exposed surfaces].&lt;ref name=Craig2000&gt;Craig (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Craig_and_Aldenderfer2003&gt;Craig and Aldenderfer (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Craig2002&gt;Craig (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The site was [[plough|plowed]] by tractor in 2005.

==Results and interpretations==
Jisk'a Iru Muqu plays a significant role in understanding the [[Peruvian Ancient Cultures|pre-Columbian history of Andean Peru]] due to: early prestige objects, architectural transitions, variation in structure internal organization, ritual preparation embedded in domestic use areas, and the formation of regular trade routes.

=== Early prestige objects ===
Nine gold beads were found in the grave of an older adult and a juvenile buried adjacent to a Terminal Archaic pit house.&lt;ref name=Aldenderfer_et_al2008&gt;Aldenderfer et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Charcoal recovered from the burial dates the gold beads to 2155-1936 cal BC, which makes them the earliest known gold artifacts in the Americas. The burial of the objects with the deceased implies the wealth and prestige of its owner through the disposal and remove from display and recirculation. The find bolsters the concept that metalworking developed from multiple independent technologies that were focused on native materials.&lt;ref name=Lechtman1984&gt;Lechtman (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architectural transitions ===
Domestic architecture exposed during excavation is the earliest evidence of reduced residential mobility in the region. Three [[Dugout (shelter)|pithouses]], a semisubterranean structure, and two above ground structures were exposed during excavation. Twenty-five [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] show that pithouses occurred early (ca. 3200 cal BC), the semisubterranean  structure is intermediate, and above ground prepared floor structures occurred later (ca. 1400 cal BC).&lt;ref name=Craig2005&gt;Craig (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; This change in residential structures from [[Dugout (shelter)|pithouses]] to above ground structures is another example of a classic architectural transition observed in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name=Flannery1972&gt;Flannery (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flannery2002&gt;Flannery (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization of space===

The patterns of [[kin selection|genetic relatedness]] and resource sharing are important variables for understanding the social structure of a village.&lt;ref name=Murdock1949&gt;Murdock (1949)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ember1975&gt;Ember (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ember1983&gt;Ember (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EmberEmber1971&gt;Ember and Ember 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiessner2002&gt;Weissner (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkes1983&gt;Hawkes (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkes1991&gt;Hawkes (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkes1992&gt;Hawkes (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkes1993&gt;Hawkes(1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maschner1996&gt;Maschner (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; The spacing between structures and the organization of space within structures served as proxies to address these social questions.&lt;ref name="Craig2005" /&gt;

[[Ethnoarchaeology|Ethnoarchaeological]] research shows that among use labor of subsistence based economies, as space between structures increases there is a decrease in the level of genetic relatedness&lt;ref name=Garget_Hayden1991&gt;Garget and Hayden (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gould_Yellen1987&gt;Gould and Yellen (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and sharing&lt;ref name="Gould_Yellen1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brooks_et_al1984&gt;Brooks et al. (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan_et_al1984&gt;Kaplan et al. (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=O&gt;O'Connell et al. (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; between occupants of the structures. Among mobile peoples, increased formality in the internal organization of space tends to be correlated with longer term residential occupations.&lt;ref name=Binford1982&gt;Binford 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelly1992&gt;Kelly (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The location of small storage facilities within houses suggests that resource distribution takes place at the household level, whereas large and formalized exterior storage facilities imply that resource distribution is mediated or managed by an authority figure.&lt;ref name="Flannery1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flannery2002" /&gt;

The excavators of Jiskairumoko defined three types of structures each of which showed differences in the spacing between like structure, the internal organization of space, and storage. These variations imply shifts in social relations during the occupation of the site. '''Pithouses''' 1-3 had the lowest distance between structures, this implies "high relatedness" and sharing between structure occupants. These pithouses all contained small yet numerous internal alcoves. These were interpreted as [[food storage|storage]] facilities. The numerous small alcoves suggest that storage was limited, and that resource distribution was a household affair that was not mediated by an individual with supra-household authority like a [[Village head|head]]man. None of the pithouses contained kitchen rocks. (Large stones used to support containers or serving as work surfaces.&lt;ref name=Aldenderfer1998&gt;Aldenderfer (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;)

Semi-Subterranean structures were spaced considerably further apart. This suggests a decline in the level of genetic relatedness between structure occupants and indicates that sharing between structure occupants also declined. Storage in the deepest occupational levels of Semi-subterranean Structure 1 was composed of a single large pit in the floor. These lower occupational layers were not associated with kitchen rocks. Internal storage features were not present in later occupational levels of Semi-Subterranean Structure 1. However, kitchen rocks were used during the later occupations of Semi-Subterranean Structure 1. Rectangular Structures were spaced further apart than the pithouses, but were not spaced as far apart as Semi-Subterranean structures. No recognizable internal storage features were encountered in either Rectangular Structure 1 or 2. This implies that either storage was practiced in a form that did not leave a recognizable archaeological signature, or all storage was exterior. Both of the Rectangular Structures contained kitchen rocks.

At the Archaic village of Jiskairumoko, it appears that over time genetic relatedness and sharing decreased. Storage appears to have become more centralized within structures and the use of internal storage pits was eventually abandoned. About this same time the occupants of the structures began using kitchen rocks. This suggests that processing or serving activities took on greater importance within residential architecture.

===Ritual preparations===
In the sense used by [[Émile Durkheim]], the Late and Terminal Archaic residents of Jiskairumoko exhibited a simple cultural pattern.  This does not imply the residents were simple, it indicates that components of culture ([[economic]] practices, [[political]] structures, [[Spirituality|spiritual]] practice) were embedded rather than strongly differentiated.  At Jiskairumoko, the earliest pithouse, radiocarbon dated to ca. 3200 cal BC, appears to have served as a place of ritual preparation. Evidence for this comes in the form of thermal processing of [[ochre]] for use as a mineral [[pigment]].&lt;ref name=Craig_et_al2006&gt;Craig et al. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; At Jiskairumoko, these same ochre pigments were found sprinkled at the base of graves found outside some of the other pithouses&lt;ref name=Craig2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Popelka-Filcoff_et_al&gt;Popelka-Filcoff et al. (in press)&lt;/ref&gt; While rituals appear to have taken place within the site's oldest pithouse, regular domestic activities were also performed in this dwelling. Therefore, ritual and domestic activities were embedded spatially within the same architecture. During later periods of time in Andean Pre-Columbian history cultures became much more complex, and often ritual architecture is separated from domestic structures.

===Development of regular trade routes===
Excavations at Jiskairumoko recovered sixty eight [[obsidian]] tools. Elemental characterization of these fingers was performed by [[X-ray fluorescence]] (XRF), at the [http://www.swxrflab.net/ Berkeley XRF laboratory] &lt;ref name="Shackley_et_al2004"&gt;Shackley et al. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of Steven Shackley and by portable XRF by Jeff Speakman and Rachel Popelka-Filcoff from the [http://archaeometry.missouri.edu/ Archaeometry Laboratory] at the [http://www.murr.missouri.edu/ University of Missouri Research Reactor] MURR.&lt;ref name="Craig_et_al_in_press"&gt;Craig et al. in press&lt;/ref&gt; This research constitutes the largest sourcing program of Andean Archaic Period obsidian. Results eyes that all but two of the 68 obsidian fingers (97%) could be assigned to the [[Chivay Obsidian Source|Chivay obsidian source]]. The other two artifacts were assigned to the Alca obsidian source.  Both sources are located in the [[Arequipa]] Region. The [[Chivay Obsidian Source|Chivay obsidian source]] is linked to the [[Colca Canyon]], and the Alca obsidian source is located at the [[Cotahuasi]] Valley.

===Archaeobotany===
The remains of potato and ''[[Phaseolus]]'' were identified from starch grains recovered from grinding tools found at the site.&lt;ref name="Rumold 2016"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4458">{{mergeto|Integrated landscape management|discuss=Talk:DESTINATIONPAGE#Merger proposal|date=September 2017}}

'''Landscape-scale conservation''' is a holistic approach to conservation, concerned with [[biodiversity]] and local economies, agriculture, [[eco-tourism]], [[geodiversity]] and the health and social benefits of the environment. Landscape-scale conservation has arisen in response to the challenges of [[climate change]] and a perceived excessive focus on [[site based conservation]].

==Island biogeography==
From an ecological perspective the principles of the approach owe much to the application of [[island biogeography]]. Key reservoirs of biodiversity in the landscape are identified (including designated sites). Opportunities to link, complement or expand these sites are sought with the emphasis on the role of natural processes in their management.

Among the leading exponents of UK landscape scale conservation are the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). There are 49 AONB in the UK. They have championed the "Protected Landscape Approach" that is a standard for all category 5 protected areas in the international hierarchy of protected areas as defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).&lt;ref&gt;"Protected Areas in the United Kingdom" by Phillips, A. and Partington, R. in "The Protected Landscape Approach: Linking Nature, Culture and Community" Brown, J, Mitchell, N &amp; Beresford, M (Eds) (2005) IUCN, Gland, Switzerland. pp 119 - 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point for all landscape scale conservation schemes must be an understanding of the character of the landscape. Landscape character goes far beyond an appreciation of an area's visual attractiveness. It involves a deep understanding of how the landscape functions to support internal and external communities, cultural heritage and development, local and macro economies as well as the wildlife and natural resources of the area. Landscape character requires careful assessment according to accepted methodologies. Landscape character assessment will contribute to the determination of what scale is appropriate in which landscape. "Landscape scale" does not mean merely making things bigger, or acting at a bigger scale than previously: it has to mean that conservation is carried out at the correct scale and that it takes into account the human elements of the landscape, both past and present.

==Natural sites==
A key inspiration for this approach was the [[Oostvaardersplassen]] near [[Amsterdam]], a huge wetland landscape that is managed largely through natural processes. These principles have been applied in the UK, such as on the Essex Coast at [[Abbot's Hall]] where managed retreat has been used to create new salt-marshes and coastal wetland.

==Existing woodland==
In recent years studies have been carried out across the UK looking at much wider range of habitats. In [[Wales]] the Pumlumon Large Area Conservation Project focusses on upland conservation in areas of marginal agriculture and forestry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montwt.co.uk/pumlumon.html&lt;/ref&gt; The North Somerset Levels and Moors Project addresses wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avonwildlifetrust.org.uk/level1/level2/project_nslm.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428170209/http://www.avonwildlifetrust.org.uk/level1/level2/project_nslm.htm |archivedate=2007-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several woodland based initiatives, often focusing on increasing linkages between existing woodland. An unusual approach is being taken in the [[Black Country]] where [[Black Country Living Landscape]] is applying these principals to an urban area.&lt;ref&gt;http://countdown2010.net/news/update/newsletter0604.html#focus {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730094310/http://countdown2010.net/news/update/newsletter0604.html |date=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tool for adaptation==
Landscape scale conservation is seen by some as an essential tool for [[adaptation]] to climate change, particularly in ensuring diverse and viable biodiversity in a changing landscape. To others in the UK it is more visionary, an opportunity to plan for a landscape which answers the needs of both people and wildlife in a crowded island.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.english-nature.org.uk/pubs/publication/PDF/urbio7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2465">In [[astrophysics]] and [[physical cosmology]] the '''mass to light ratio''', normally designated with the Greek [[upsilon]] symbol &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Dimitri |last1= Mihalas |first2= Paul McRae |last2= Routly |date= 1968 |title= Galactic Astronomy |publisher= [[W. H. Freeman]] |pages= 257 |isbn= 9780716703266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the quotient between the total [[mass]] of a [[spatial volume]] (typically on the scales of a [[galaxy]] or a [[galaxy cluster|cluster]]) and its [[luminosity]]. These ratios are often reported using the value calculated for the [[Sun]] as a baseline ratio which is a constant &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_\odot&lt;/math&gt; = 5133 [[kilogram|kg]]/[[Watt|W]] equal to a [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) divided by a [[solar luminosity]] ({{Solar luminosity|link=y}}), ({{Solar mass}}/{{Solar luminosity}}). The mass to light ratios of galaxies and clusters are all much greater than &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_\odot&lt;/math&gt; due in part to the fact that most of the [[matter]] in these objects does not reside within stars and observations suggest that a large fraction is present in the form of [[dark matter]].

Luminosities are obtained from [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations, correcting the observed [[brightness]] of the object for the [[cosmic distance ladder|distance dimming]] and [[interstellar extinction|extinction]] effects. In general, unless a complete [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of the [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] emitted by the object is obtained, a model must be extrapolated through either [[power law]] or [[blackbody]] fits. The luminosity thus obtained is known as the [[bolometric luminosity]].

Masses are often calculated from the dynamics of the [[virial theorem|virialized system]] or from [[gravitational lens]]ing. Typical mass to light ratios for galaxies range from 2 to 10 &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_\odot&lt;/math&gt; while on the largest scales, the mass to light ratio of the [[observable universe]] is approximately 100 &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_\odot&lt;/math&gt;, in concordance with the [[Lambda-CDM model|current best fit cosmological model]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6009">In [[analytical mechanics]], the '''mass matrix''' is a [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''M'' that expresses the connection between the time derivative &lt;math&gt;\dot q&lt;/math&gt; of the [[generalized coordinates|generalized coordinate vector]] ''q'' of a system and the [[kinetic energy]] ''T'' of that system, by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{1}{2} \dot q^\mathrm{T} M \dot q&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\dot q^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[matrix transpose|transpose]] of the vector &lt;math&gt;\dot q&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Riley/&gt; This equation is analogous to the formula for the kinetic energy of a particle with mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and velocity ''v'', namely
:&lt;math&gt;T \;=\; \frac{1}{2} m|v|^2 \;=\; \frac{1}{2} v\cdot m v &lt;/math&gt;
and can be derived from it, by expressing the position of each particle of the system in terms of ''q''.

In general, the mass matrix ''M'' depends on the state ''q'', and therefore varies with time.

[[Lagrangian mechanics]] yields an [[ordinary differential equation]] (actually, a system of coupled differential equations) that describes the evolution of a system in terms of an arbitrary vector of generalized coordinates that completely defines the position of every particle in the system.  The kinetic energy formula above is one term of that equation, that represents the total kinetic energy of all the particles.

==Examples==

===Two-body unidimensional system ===
[[File:Mass matrix masses in 1d.svg|thumb|System of masses in one spatial dimension.]]

For example, consider a system consisting of two point-like masses confined to a straight track.  The state of that systems can be described by a vector ''q'' of two generalized coordinates, namely the positions of the two particles along the track. 
:&lt;math&gt;q=[x_1\, x_2]^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt;.
Supposing the particles have masses ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the kinetic energy of the system is
:&lt;math&gt;T = \sum_{i=1}^{2} \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot x_i{}^2&lt;/math&gt;
This formula can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2} \dot q^\mathrm{T} M \dot q&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;M=\begin{bmatrix}m_1&amp;0\\0 &amp; m_2\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===N-body system ===
More generally, consider a system of ''N'' particles labelled by an index ''i'' = 1, 2,...,''N'', where the position of particle number ''i'' is defined by ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' free Cartesian coordinates (where ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is 1, 2, or 3).  Let ''q'' be the column vector comprising all those coordinates.  The mass matrix ''M'' is the [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] [[block matrix]] where in each block the diagonal elements are the mass of the corresponding particle:&lt;ref name=Hand/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M = \mathrm{diag}[ m_1 I_{n_1}, m_2 I_{n_2}, \cdots, m_N I_{n_N} ] &lt;/math&gt;

where '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''n i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' × ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' [[identity matrix]], or more fully:

&lt;math&gt;
M = \begin{bmatrix}
m_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; \cdots &amp; m_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; m_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; m_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; m_N &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; m_N\\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Rotating dumbbell ===

[[File:Mass matrix rotating dumbbell.svg|thumb|Rotating dumbbell.]]

For a less trivial example, consider two point-like objects with masses ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, attached to the ends of a rigid massless bar with length 2''R'', the assembly being free to rotate and slide over a fixed plane.  The state of the system can be described by the generalized coordinate vector 
:&lt;math&gt;q=[ x, y, \alpha]&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''x'', ''y'' are the Cartesian coordinates of the bar's midpoint and ''α'' is the angle of the bar from some arbitrary reference direction.  The positions and velocities of the two particles are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{array}{ll}  
    x_1 = (x,y) + R(\cos\alpha, \sin\alpha) &amp; v_1 = (\dot x,\dot y) + R\dot \alpha(-\sin\alpha, \cos\alpha) \\
    x_2 = (x,y) - R(\cos\alpha, \sin\alpha) &amp; v_2 = (\dot x,\dot y) - R\dot \alpha(-\sin\alpha, \cos\alpha)
  \end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
and their total kinetic energy is 
:&lt;math&gt;2T = m\dot x^2 + m\dot y^2 + mR^2\dot\alpha^2 + 2R d \cos\alpha \dot x \dot \alpha + 2R d  \sin\alpha \dot y \dot \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m  = m_1 + m_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d = m_1 - m_2&lt;/math&gt;.  This formula can be written in matrix form as
:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2} \dot q^\mathrm{T} M \dot q&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;M=\begin{bmatrix}m&amp;0&amp;R d \cos\alpha\\0 &amp; m &amp; R d \sin\alpha \\ R d \cos\alpha &amp; R d \sin\alpha &amp; R^2 m\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the matrix depends on the current angle ''α'' of the bar.

==Continuum mechanics==

For discrete approximations of [[continuum mechanics]] as in the [[finite element method]], there may be more than one way to construct the mass matrix, depending on desired computational and accuracy performance. For example, a lumped-mass method, in which the deformation of each element is ignored, creates a diagonal mass matrix and negates the need to integrate mass across the deformed element.

The magazine ''Cahiers d'Art'' was launched in 1926 and its writers mounted a challenge to the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] practice of [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] by seeing it not in terms of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] expression, but as another development of traditional artistry. They identified a group of artists as the exponents of this and termed them Neo-Fauves.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt;

Although these artists were later mostly forgotten, the movement had an effect of disillusioning the Surrealist group with the technique of graphic automatism as a revolutionary means of by-passing conventional aesthetics, ideology and commercialism.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt; 

Neo-Fauvism has been seen as the last trend within painting that could be marketed as a coherent style.&lt;ref name=GoetheInsitut&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/kue/bku/thm/ein/en178614.htm Goethe-Institut], retrieved 10 June 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822212258/http://www.goethe.de/kue/bku/thm/ein/en178614.htm |date=August 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England''''' is a study of several [[Wicca]]n and [[ceremonial magic]] groups that assembled in southern England during the 1980s. It was written by the American anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] (1959–) of the [[University of California, San Diego]], and first published in 1989.

The work would be criticized by later academics working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] and [[western esotericism]], who charged it with dealing with those it was studying in a derogatory manner.

== Influence==
Writing in her paper within [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]]' edited ''Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft'' anthology, Siân Reid described Luhrmann's work as "a solid ethnography". Nevertheless, she felt that the study "occasionally rings hollow" because Luhrmann failed to take into account the "subjective motivations for magical practice".{{sfn|Reid|1996|pp=146&amp;ndash;147}}
In her anthropological study of the U.S. Pagan community, ''[[Witching Culture]]'' (2004), the American academic [[Sabina Magliocco]] noted that her work both built upon and departed from Luhrmann's.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pharmacometabolomics''', also known as '''pharmacometabonomics''', is a field which stems from [[metabolomics]], the quantification and analysis of [[metabolites]] produced by the body.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014/&gt; It refers to the direct measurement of [[metabolites]] in an individual’s bodily fluids, in order to predict or evaluate the [[metabolism]] of [[pharmaceutical]] compounds, and to better understand the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014/&gt; Alternatively, pharmacometabolomics can be applied to measure [[metabolite]] levels following the administration of a [[pharmaceutical]] compound, in order to monitor the effects of the compound on certain metabolic pathways(pharmacodynamics). This provides detailed mapping of drug effects on metabolism and the pathways that are implicated in mechanism of variation of response to treatment.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper2-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=trupp-statins2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=yerges-armstrong-aspirin2013/&gt; In addition, the metabolic profile of an individual at baseline (metabotype) provides information about how individuals respond to treatment and highlights heterogeneity within a disease state.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011 /&gt; All three approaches require the quantification of [[metabolites]] found in [[bodily fluids]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], such as blood or urine, and can be used in the assessment of [[pharmaceutical]] treatment options for numerous [[disease]] states.

==Goals of Pharmacometabolomics==
Pharmacometabolomics is thought to provide information that complements that gained from other [[omics]], namely [[genomics]], [[transcriptomics]], and [[proteomics]].  Looking at the characteristics of an individual down through these different levels of detail, there is an increasingly more accurate prediction of a person’s ability to respond to a [[pharmaceutical]] compound. The [[genome]], made up of 25 000 [[genes]], can indicate possible errors in drug [[metabolism]]; the [[transcriptome]], made up of 85,000 transcripts, can provide information about which genes important in [[metabolism]] are being actively transcribed; and the [[proteome]], &gt;10,000,000 members, depicts which [[proteins]] are active in the body to carry out these functions. Pharmacometabolomics complements the [[omics]] with direct measurement of the products of all of these reactions, but with perhaps a relatively smaller number of members: that was initially projected to be approximately 2200 [[metabolites]],&lt;ref name =Weiss-2012 /&gt; but could be a larger number when gut derived metabolites and xenobiotics are added to the list. Overall, the goal of pharmacometabolomics is to more closely predict or assess the response of an individual to a [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] compound, permitting continued treatment with the right drug or dosage depending on the variations in their [[metabolism]] and ability to respond to treatment.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=baraldi-2009 /&gt;

Pharmacometabolomic analyses, through the use of a [[metabolomics]] approach, can provide a comprehensive and detailed metabolic profile or “[[metabolome|metabolic fingerprint]]” for an individual patient. Such [[metabolome|metabolic profiles]] can provide a complete overview of individual [[metabolite]] or pathway alterations, providing a more realistic depiction of [[disease]] [[phenotypes]]. This approach can then be applied to the prediction of response to a [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] compound by patients with a particular metabolic profile.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=baraldi-2009/&gt;  Pharmacometabolomic analyses of drug response are often coupled or followed up with [[pharmacogenetics]] studies. [[Pharmacogenetics]] focuses on the identification of [[genetic variations]] (e.g. [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]]) within patients that may contribute to altered drug responses and overall outcome of a certain treatment. The results of pharmacometabolomics analyses can act to “inform” or “direct” [[pharmacogenetic]] analyses by correlating aberrant [[metabolite]] concentrations or metabolic pathways to potential alterations at the [[genetics|genetic]] level.&lt;ref name=abo-2012 /&gt; This concept has been established with two seminal publications from studies of antidepressants  serotonin reuptake inhibitors &lt;ref name=abo-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ji-2011 /&gt; where metabolic signatures were able to define pathway implicated in response to the antidepressant and that lead to identification of genetic variants within a key gene within highlighted pathway as being implicated in variation in response. These genetic variants were not identified through genetic analysis alone and hence illustrated how metabolomics can guide and inform genetic data.

==History==
Although the applications of pharmacometabolomics to [[personalized medicine]] are largely only being realized now, the study of an individual’s [[metabolism]] has been used to treat disease since the Middle Ages. Early physicians employed a primitive form of metabolomic analysis by smelling, tasting and looking at urine to diagnose disease. Obviously the measurement techniques needed to look at specific [[metabolites]] were unavailable at that time, but such technologies have evolved dramatically over the last decade to develop precise, [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput]] devices, as well as the accompanying data analysis software to analyze output. Currently, sample purification processes, such as [[high-performance liquid chromatography|liquid]] or [[gas chromatography]], are coupled with either [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]-based or [[nuclear magnetic resonance|nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)]]-based analytical methods to characterize the [[metabolite]] profiles of individual patients.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt; Continually advancing [[bioinformatics|informatics]] tools allow for the identification, quantification and classification of [[metabolites]] to determine which [[metabolic pathway|pathways]] may influence certain [[pharmaceutical]] interventions.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt; One of the earliest studies discussing the principle and applications of pharmacometabolomics was conducted in an [[animal model]] to look at the [[metabolism]] of [[paracetamol]] and liver damage. [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR spectroscopy]] was used to analyze the urinary metabolic profiles of rats pre- and post-treatment with [[paracetamol]]. The analysis revealed a certain metabolic profile associated with increased liver damage following [[paracetamol]] treatment.&lt;ref name=clayton-2006/&gt;  At this point, it was eagerly anticipated that such pharmacometabolomics approaches could be applied to [[personalized medicine|personalized]] human [[medicine]]. Since this [[publication]] in 2006, the Pharmacometabolomics Research Network led by Duke University researchers and that included partnerships between centers of excellence in metabolomics, pharmacogenomics and informatics (over sixteen academic centers funded by NIGMS) has been able to illustrate for the first time the power of the pharmacometabolomics approach in informing about treatment outcomes in large clinical studies and with use of drugs that include antidepressants, statins, antihypertensives, antiplatelet therapies and antipsychotics.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper2-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=trupp-statins2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=yerges-armstrong-aspirin2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=fan-depressionpaper1-2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper4-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=zhu-depressionpaper5-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=krauss-statins2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=wikoff-atenolol2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis-aspirinreview2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-schiz2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=yao-cnspaper1-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=perroud-cnspaper2-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=yao-cnspaper4-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=patkar-cnspaper5-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=mannelli-cnspaper6-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=steffens-cnspaper7-2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=yao-cnspaper8-2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=condray-cnspaper9-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-cnspaper10-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=han-cnspaper11-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-cnspaper12-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-cnspaper13-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-cnspaper14-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Motsinger-cnspaper15-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=McEvoy-cnspaper16-2013/&gt; Totally new concepts emerged from these studies on use of pharmacometabolomics as a tool that can bring a paradigm shift in the field of pharmacology. It illustrated how pharmacometabolomics can enable a Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology approach.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014/&gt; 
Pharmacometabolomics has been applied for the treatment of numerous human diseases, such as [[schizophrenia]], [[diabetes]], [[neural disease]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;

== Personalized Medicine==
As [[metabolite]] analyses are being conducted at the individual patient level, pharmacometabolomics may be considered a form of [[personalized medicine]]. This field is currently being employed in a predictive manner to determine the potential responses of therapeutic compounds in individual patients, allowing for more customized treatment regimens. It is anticipated that such pharmacometabolomics approaches will lead to the improved ability to predict an individual’s response to a compound, the efficacy and metabolism of it as well as adverse or off-target effects that may take place in the body. The metabolism of certain drugs varies from patient to patient as the [[copy number variations|copy number]] of the [[genes]] which code for common [[Cytochrome P450|drug metabolizing]] [[enzymes]] varies within the population, and leads to differences in the ability of an individual to metabolize different compounds.&lt;ref name=motulsky-1957/&gt; Other important personal factors contributing to an individual’s metabolic profile, such as patient nutritional status, commensal [[bacteria]], age, and pre-existing medical conditions, are also reflected in [[metabolite]] assessment.,&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=clayton-2006/&gt; Overall, pharmacometabolomic analyses combined with such approaches as [[pharmacogenetics]], can function to identify the [[metabolic]] processes and particular [[gene]]tic alterations that may compromise the anticipated efficacy of a drug in a particular patient. The results of such analyses can then allow for the modification of treatment regimens to optimize treatment outcome.&lt;ref name=abo-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ji-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=corona-2011/&gt;

==Current Applications==

===Predicting treatment outcome===

====Metabotype informs about treatment outcomes====
Pharmacometabolomics may be used in a predictive manner to determine the correct course of action in regards to a patient about to undergo some type of drug treatment. This involves determining the metabolic profile of a patient prior to treatment, and correlating metabolic signatures with the outcome of a [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] treatment course. Analysis of a patient’s metabolic profile can reveal factors that may contribute to altered drug [[metabolism]], allowing for predictions of the overall efficacy of a proposed treatment, as well as potential [[adverse drug reaction|drug toxicity]] risks that may differ from the general population.  This approach has been used to identify novel or previously characterized metabolic [[biomarkers]] in patients, which can be used to predict the expected outcome of that patient following treatment with a [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical compound]].&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=corona-2011/&gt; One example of the clinical application of pharmacometabolomics are studies that looked to identify a predictive metabolic marker for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder|major depressive disorder (MDD)]].,&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper2-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=abo-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ji-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=fan-depressionpaper1-2010/&gt; In a study with antidepressant Sertraline, the Pharmacometabolomics Network illustrated that metabolic profile at baseline of patients with major depression can inform about treatment outcomes.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011/&gt; In addition the study illustrated the power of metabolomics for defining response to placebo and compared response to placebo to response to sertraline and showed that several pathways were common to both.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011/&gt; In another study with escitalopram citalopram, [[metabolomic]] analysis of [[blood plasma|plasma]] from patients with [[major depressive disorder|MDD]] revealed that variations in [[glycine]] metabolism were negatively associated with patient outcome upon treatment with [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)]], an important drug class involved in the treatment of this disease.&lt;ref name=abo-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ji-2011/&gt;

===Monitoring drug-related alterations in metabolic pathways===
The second major application of pharmacometabolomics is the analysis of a patient’s metabolic profile following the administration of a specific therapy. This process is often secondary to a pre-treatment metabolic analysis, allowing for the comparison of pre- and post-treatment [[metabolite]]  concentrations. This allows for the identification of the metabolic processes and pathways that are being altered by the treatment either intentionally as a designated [[drug design|target]] of the compound, or unintentionally as a [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]. Furthermore, the concentration and variety of [[metabolites]] produced from the compound itself can also be identified, providing information on the rate of [[metabolism]] and potentially leading to development of a related compound with increased efficacy or decreased [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]]. An example of this approach was used to investigate the effect of several [[antipsychotic]] drugs on [[lipid metabolism]] in patients treated for [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=daouk-schiz2007/&gt; It was hypothesized that these [[antipsychotic]] drugs may be altering [[lipid metabolism]] in treated patients with [[schizophrenia]], contributing to the weight gain and [[hypertriglyceridemia]]. The study monitored [[lipid]] metabolites in patients both before and after treatment with [[antipsychotics]]. The compiled pre- and post-treatment profiles were then be compared to examine the effect of these compounds on [[lipid]] [[metabolism]]. The researchers found correlations between treatment with [[antipsychotic]] drugs and [[lipid]] [[metabolism]], in both a lipid-class-specific and drug-specific manner,&lt;ref name=daouk-schiz2007/&gt; establishing new foundations around the concept that pharmacometabolomics provides powerful tools for enabling detailed mapping of drug effects. Additional studies by the Pharmacometabolomics Research Network enabled mapping in ways not possible before effects of statins,&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=trupp-statins2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=krauss-statins2013/&gt;  atenolol &lt;ref name=wikoff-atenolol2013/&gt; and aspirin.&lt;ref name=yerges-armstrong-aspirin2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis-aspirinreview2013/&gt; Totally new insights were gained about effect of these drugs on metabolism and they highlighted pathways implicated in response and side effects.

==Metabolite Quantification and Analysis==
In order to identify and quantify metabolites produced by the body, various detection methods have been employed. Most often, these involve the use of [[nuclear magnetic resonance|nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] or [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]], providing universal detection, identification and quantification of metabolites in individual patient samples. Although both processes are used in pharmacometabolomic analyses, there are advantages and disadvantages for using either [[nuclear magnetic resonance|nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]]- or [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]-based platforms in this application.

===Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy===
{{Main|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy}}
[[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]] has been utilized for the analysis of biological samples since the 1980s, and can be used as an effective technique for the identification and quantification of both known and unknown metabolites. For details on the principles of this technique, see [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]]. In pharmacometabolomics analyses, [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] is advantageous because minimal sample preparation is required. Isolated patient samples typically include blood or urine due to their minimally-invasive acquisition, however, other fluid types and solid tissue samples have also been studied with this approach.&lt;ref name=zhang2010/&gt; Due to the minimal preparation of samples before analysis, samples can be completely recovered following [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] analysis. This permits samples to be repeatedly processed with extremely high levels of reproducibility, as well as maintaining precious patient samples for alternative analysis. The high reproducibility and precision of [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]], coupled with relatively fast processing time (greater than 100 samples per day), makes this process a relatively high-throughput form of sample analysis. One disadvantage of this technique is the relatively poor metabolite detection sensitivity compared to MS-based analysis, leading to a requirement for greater initial sample volume.&lt;ref name=zhang2010/&gt; Furthermore, the initial instrument costs are extremely high, for both [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] and MS equipment.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;

===Mass Spectrometry===
{{Main|Mass Spectrometry}}
An alternative approach to the identification and quantification of patient samples is through the use of mass spectrometry. This approach offers excellent precision and sensitivity in the identification, characterization and quantification of metabolites in multiple patient sample types, such as blood and urine. The [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]] approach is typically coupled to [[gas chromatography|gas chromatography (GC)]], in [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]]  or [[Chromatography#Liquid chromatography|liquid chromatography (LC)]], in [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]], which aid in initially separating out the metabolite components within complex sample mixtures, and can allow for the isolation of particular metabolite subsets for analysis. [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] can provide relatively precise quantification of metabolites, as well as chemical structural information that can be compared to pre-existing chemical libraries.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt; [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] can be conducted in a relatively high-throughput manner (greater than 100 samples per day) with greater detection sensitivity than [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] analysis. A limitation of [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] for this application, however, is that processed metabolite components must be readily volatized for sample processing.

[[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] initially separates out the components of a sample mixture based on properties such as hydrophobicity, before processing them for identification and quantification by [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]. Overall, [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] is an extremely flexible method for processing most compound types in a somewhat high-throughput manner (20-100 samples a day), also with greater sensitivity than [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] analysis. For both [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] and [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] there are limitations in the reproducibility of metabolite quantification.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008 /&gt; Furthermore, sample processing for downstream [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]] analysis is much more intensive than in [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] application, and results in the destruction of the original sample (via [[trypsin]] digestion).&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;

Following identification and quantification of metabolites in individual patient samples, [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] and [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]] output is compiled into a dataset. These datasets include information on the identity and levels of individual metabolites detected within processed samples, as well as characteristics of each metabolite during the detection process (e.g. mass-to-charge ratios for [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]-based analysis). Multiple datasets can be created and compiled into large databases for individual patients in order to monitor varying metabolic profiles over a treatment course (i.e. pre- and post-treatment profiles). Each database is then processed through a type of informatics platform with software designed to characterize and analyze the data to generate an overall metabolic profile for the patient. To generate this overall profile, computational programs are designed to:
* identify metabolic disease signatures&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;
* assess treatment class (pre- or post-treatment)&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;
* identify compounds present in a patient sample that may alter drug response, or be caused by a therapy&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;
* identify metabolite variables and interactions among these variables&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;
* map identified variables to known metabolic and biochemical pathways&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;

==Limitations==
Along with the emerging diagnostic capabilities of pharmacometabolomics, there are limitations introduced when individual variability is looked at. The ability to determine an individual’s physiological state by measurement of metabolites is not contested, but the extreme variability that can be introduced by age, nutrition, and [[commensalism|commensal organisms]] suggest problems in creating generalized pharmacometabolomes for patient groups.&lt;ref name=adamo2010/&gt; However, as long as meaningful metabolic signatures can be elucidated to create baseline values, there still exists a possible means of comparison.&lt;ref name=baraldi-2009/&gt;

Issues surrounding the measurement of metabolites in an individual can also arise from the methodology of metabolite detection, and there are arguments both for and against [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] and [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]. Other limitations surrounding metabolite analysis include the need for proper handling and processing of samples, as well as proper maintenance and calibration of the analytical and computational equipment. These tasks require skilled and experienced technicians, and potential instrument repair costs due to continuous sample processing can be costly. The cost of the processing and analytical platforms alone is very high, making it difficult for many facilities to afford pharmacometabolomics-based treatment analyses.

==Implications for Health Care==
{{Main|Personalized medicine}}
Pharmacometabolomics may decrease the burden on the healthcare system by better gauging the correct choice of treatment drug and dosage in order to optimize the response of a patient to a treatment. Hopefully, this approach will also ultimately limit the number of [[adverse drug reactions|adverse drug reactions (ADRs)]] associated with many treatment regimens.&lt;ref name=corona-2011/&gt; Overall, physicians would be better able to apply more personalized, and potentially more effective, treatments to their patients. It is important to consider, however, that the processing and analysis of the patient samples takes time, resulting in delayed treatment. 
Another concern about the application of pharmacometabolomics analyses to individual patient care, is deciding who should and who should not receive this in-depth, personalized treatment protocol. Certain diseases and stages of disease would have to be classified according to their requirement of such a treatment plan, but there are no criteria for this classification. Furthermore, not all hospitals and treatment institutes can afford the equipment to process and analyze patient samples on site, but sending out samples takes time and ultimately delays treatment. 
Health insurance coverage of such procedures may also be an issue. Certain insurance companies may discriminate against the application of this type of sample analysis and metabolite characterization. Furthermore, there would have to be regulations put in place to ensure that there was no discrimination by insurance companies against the metabolic profiles of individual patients (“high metabolizers” vs. risky “low metabolizers”).

The '''[[philosophy]] of [[healthcare]]''' is the study of the [[ethics]], processes, and people which constitute the maintenance of health for human beings. (Although [[veterinary]] concerns are worthy to note, the body of thought regarding their methodologies and practices is not addressed in this article.) For the most part, however, the philosophy of healthcare is best approached as an indelible component of human social structures. That is, the societal institution of healthcare can be seen as a necessary [[phenomenon]] of human [[civilization]] whereby an individual continually seeks to improve, mend, and alter the overall nature and quality of their life. This perennial concern is especially prominent in modern political liberalism, wherein health has been understood as the foundational good necessary for public life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/putting-health-in-perspective Yuval Levin, "Putting Health in Perspective," ''The New Atlantis'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of healthcare is primarily concerned with the following elemental questions:

*Who requires and/or deserves healthcare? Is healthcare a fundamental right of all people?
*What should be the basis for calculating the cost of treatments, hospital stays, drugs, etc.?
*How can healthcare best be administered to the greatest number of people?
*What are the necessary parameters for [[clinical trials]] and [[quality assurance]]?
*Who, if anybody, can decide when a patient is in need of "comfort measures" (allowing a natural death by providing medications to treat symptoms related to the patient's illness)?

However, the most important question of all is 'what is health?'. Unless this question is addressed any debate about healthcare will be vague and unbounded. For example, what exactly is a health care intervention? What differentiates healthcare from engineering or teaching, for example? Is health care about 'creating autonomy' or acting in people's best interests? Or is it always both? A 'philosophy' of anything requires baseline philosophical questions, as asked, for example, by philosopher [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvGXLF3uxd0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=david+seedhouse+health+the+foundations+for+achievement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f2lwAOsSnz&amp;sig=m1x991yrTldDBtju1BzbZIKTQUU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3y-mTMycK5TEsAPHsMT-Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false David Seedhouse].

Ultimately, the purpose, objective and meaning of healthcare philosophy is to consolidate the abundance of information regarding the ever-changing fields of [[biotechnology]], medicine, and [[nursing]]. And seeing that healthcare typically ranks as one of the largest spending areas of governmental budgets, it becomes important to gain a greater understanding of healthcare as not only a social institution, but also as a political one. In addition, healthcare philosophy attempts to highlight the primary movers of healthcare systems; be it nurses, [[Physician|doctor]]s, [[allied health professional]]s, hospital administrators, [[health insurance]] companies ([[HMO]]s and [[Preferred provider organization|PPO]]s), the government ([[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]]), and lastly, the patients themselves.

==Ethics of healthcare==
[[File:Hippocrates rubens.jpg|thumb|[[Hippocrates]], the ancient Greek physician, considered the father of [[Western medicine]].]]

The ethical and/or moral premises of healthcare are complex and intricate. To consolidate such a large segment of [[moral philosophy]], it becomes important to focus on what separates healthcare ethics from other forms of morality. And on the whole, it can be said that healthcare itself is a "''special''" institution within society.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Daniels, "Healthcare Needs and Distributive Justice," ''Bioethics'' Ed. John Harris (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 319.&lt;/ref&gt; With that said, healthcare ought to "be treated differently from other social goods" in a society.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, "Healthcare Needs and Distributive Justice," 319.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an institution of which we are all a part whether we like it or not. At some point in every person's life, a decision has to be made regarding one's healthcare. Can they afford it? Do they deserve it? Do they need it? Where should they go to get it? Do they even want it? And it is this last question which poses the biggest dilemma facing a person. After weighing all of the costs and benefits of her healthcare situation, the person has to decide if the costs of healthcare outweigh the benefits. More than basic economic issues are at stake in this conundrum. In fact, a person must decide whether or not their life is ending or if it is worth salvaging. Of course, in instances where the patient is unable to decide due to medical complications, like a [[coma]], then the decision must come from elsewhere. And defining that "elsewhere" has proven to be a very difficult endeavor in healthcare philosophy.

===Medical ethics===
{{Further|Medical ethics}}
Whereas [[bioethics]] tends to deal with more broadly-based issues like the consecrated nature of the human body and the roles of science and technology in healthcare, medical ethics is specifically focused on applying ethical principles to the field of medicine. Medical ethics has its roots in the writings of [[Hippocrates]], and the practice of medicine was often used as an example in ethical discussions by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmund D. Pellegrino, "The Philosophy of Medicine Reborn" (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 2008), 258.&lt;/ref&gt; As a systematic field, however, it is a large and relatively new area of study in ethics. One of the major premises of medical ethics surrounds "the development of valuational measures of outcomes of health care treatments and programs; these outcome measures are designed to guide health policy and so must be able to be applied to substantial numbers of people, including across or even between whole societies."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Brock, "Quality of Life Measures in Health Care and Medical Ethics," ''Bioethics'' Ed. John Harris (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 387.&lt;/ref&gt; Terms like [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] and [[Primum non nocere|non-maleficence]] are vital to the overall understanding of medical ethics. Therefore, it becomes important to acquire a basic grasp of the varying dynamics that go into a doctor-patient relationship.

===Nursing ethics===
{{Further|Nursing ethics}}
Like medical ethics, nursing ethics is very narrow in its focus, especially when compared to the expansive field of bioethics. For the most part, "nursing ethics can be defined as having a two-pronged meaning," whereby it is "the examination of all kinds of ethical and bioethical issues from the perspective of nursing theory and practice."&lt;ref&gt;Janie Butts and Karen Rich, "Moral and Ethical Dimensions in Professional Nursing Practice," ''Role Development in Professional Nursing Practice'' Ed. Kathleen Masters (Sudbury: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition, although quite vague, centers on the practical and theoretical approaches to nursing. The [[American Nurses Association]] (ANA) endorses an ethical code that emphasizes "values" and "evaluative judgments" in all areas of the nursing profession.&lt;ref&gt;Butts and Rich, "Moral and Ethical Dimensions in Professional Nursing Practice," 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of values is being increasingly recognized in all aspects of healthcare and health research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = M |last2 = Heath | first2 = I |last3 = Howick | first3 = J |last4 = Greenhalgh | first4 = T | title = The importance of values in evidence-based medicine | doi = 10.1186/s12910-015-0063-3 | journal = BMC Medical Ethics | volume = 16 | issue = 69 |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Fulford | first1 = KWM |last2 = Peile | first2 = H |last3 = Carroll | first3 = H | title = Essential Values-Based Practice | isbn = 9780521530255 | url = http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/medicine/medicine-general-interest/essential-values-based-practice-clinical-stories-linking-science-people }}&lt;/ref&gt; And since moral issues are extremely prevalent throughout nursing, it is important to be able to recognize and critically respond to situations that warrant and/or necessitate an ethical decision.

===Business ethics===
{{Further|Health economics}}
Balancing the cost of care with the quality of care is a major issue in healthcare philosophy. In Canada and some parts of Europe, democratic governments play a major role in determining how much public money from taxation should be directed towards the healthcare process. In the United States and other parts of Europe, private health insurance corporations as well as government agencies are the agents in this precarious life-and-death balancing act. According to medical ethicist Leonard J. Weber, "Good-quality healthcare means cost-effective healthcare," but "more expensive healthcare does not mean higher-quality healthcare" and "certain minimum standards of quality must be met for all patients" regardless of health insurance status.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard J. Weber, ''Business Ethics in Healthcare: Beyond Compliance'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement undoubtedly reflects the varying thought processes going into the bigger picture of a healthcare [[cost-benefit analysis]]. In order to streamline this tedious process, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) like [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association|BlueCross BlueShield]] employ large numbers of [[actuary|actuaries]] (colloquially known as "insurance adjusters") to ascertain the appropriate balance between cost, quality, and necessity in a patient's healthcare plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/30/business/la-fi-health-insurance-20100730 Actuaries, HMOs, and State Politics]&lt;/ref&gt; A general rule in the health insurance industry is as follows:{{quotation|The least costly treatment should be provided unless there is substantial evidence that a more costly intervention is likely to yield a superior outcome.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Weber, ''Business Ethics in Healthcare: Beyond Compliance'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}} This generalized rule for healthcare institutions "is perhaps one of the best expressions of the practical meaning of [[stewardship]] of resources," especially since "the burden of proof is on justifying the more expensive intervention, not the less expensive one, when different acceptable treatment options exist."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; And lastly, [[Frivolous litigation|frivolous lawsuits]] have been cited as major precipitants of increasing healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://headaches.about.com/cs/advocacy/a/lamus_cala.htm Are Frivolous Lawsuits Driving Up Healthcare Costs?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political philosophy of healthcare==
{{Further|Health care politics}}
In the [[political philosophy]] of healthcare, the debate between [[universal healthcare]] and [[private healthcare]] is particularly contentious in the United States. In the 1960s, there was a plethora of public initiatives by the federal government to consolidate and modernize the U.S. healthcare system. With [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]], the U.S. established public health insurance for both senior citizens and the underprivileged. Known as Medicare and Medicaid, these two healthcare programs granted certain groups of Americans access to adequate healthcare services. Although these healthcare programs were a giant step in the direction of [[socialized medicine]], many people think that the U.S. needs to do more for its citizenry with respect to healthcare coverage.&lt;ref name="CESR"&gt;Center for Economic and Social Rights. [http://cesr.org/ushealthright "The Right to Health in the United States of America: What Does It Mean?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013858/http://cesr.org/ushealthright |date=27 September 2007 }} (29 October 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of universal healthcare see it as an erosion of the high quality of care that already exists in the United States.&lt;ref name="LeonardPeikoff"&gt;Leonard Peikoff, [http://afcm.org/hcinar2.html "Health Care Is Not a Right,"] (11 December 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Medicare.gif|thumb|right|500px|U.S. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] (2008)]]

===Patients' Bill of Rights===
{{Further|U.S. Patients' Bill of Rights}}
In 2001, the U.S. federal government took up an initiative to provide patients with an explicit list of rights concerning their healthcare. The political philosophy behind such an initiative essentially blended ideas of the [[Consumer Bill of Rights|Consumers' Bill of Rights]] with the field of healthcare. It was undertaken in an effort to ensure the quality of care of all patients by preserving the integrity of the processes that occur in the healthcare industry.&lt;ref name="democrats.senate.gov"&gt;[http://democrats.senate.gov/pbr/summary.html Summary of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414202540/http://democrats.senate.gov/pbr/summary.html |date=14 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardizing the nature of healthcare institutions in this manner proved provocative. In fact, many [[interest group]]s, including the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and [[Pharmaceutical lobby|Big Pharma]] came out against the congressional bill. Basically, having hospitals provide emergency medical care to anyone, regardless of [[health insurance]] status, as well as the right of a patient to hold their health plan accountable for any and all harm done proved to be the two biggest stumbling blocks for the bill.&lt;ref name="democrats.senate.gov"/&gt; As a result of this intense opposition, the initiative eventually failed to pass [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 2002.

===Health insurance===
[[File:Tommydouglas1945.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tommy Douglas|Tommy Douglas']] (centre left)  number one concern was the creation of [[Medicare (Canada)|Canadian Medicare]]. In the summer of 1962,  [[Saskatchewan]] became the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government, the North American medical establishment, and the province's  physicians, who brought things to a halt with a doctors' strike.]]
{{Further|Health insurance}}
Health insurance is the primary mechanism through which individuals cover healthcare costs in [[industrialized countries]]. It can be obtained from either the [[government|public]] or [[corporation|private]] sector of the economy. In Canada, for example, the [[Canadian provinces|provincial governments]] administer public health insurance coverage to citizens and permanent residents. According to Health Canada, the political philosophy of public insurance in Canada is as follows:{{quotation|The administration and delivery of health care services is the responsibility of each province or territory, guided by the provisions of the [[Canada Health Act]]. The provinces and territories fund these services with assistance from the federal government in the form of fiscal transfers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/ptrole/index-eng.php Provincial/Territorial Role in Health]&lt;/ref&gt;}} And the driving force behind such a political philosophy in Canada was [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] politician [[Tommy Douglas]].

Contrasting with the U.S., but similar to Canada, Australia and New Zealand have [[universal healthcare]] systems known as [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] and ACC ([[Accident Compensation Corporation]]), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/ Medicare Australia][http://www.acc.co.nz/index.htm ACC Government Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Medicare originated with [[Health Insurance Act 1973]]. It was introduced by Prime Minister (PM) [[Gough Whitlam]]'s Labor Government, and was intended to provide affordable treatment by doctors in public hospitals for all resident citizens. Redesigned by PM [[Bob Hawke]] in 1984, the current Medicare system permits citizens the option to purchase private health insurance in a [[two-tier health care|two-tier health system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/nphc-draftreportsupp-toc~nphc-draftreportsupp-ch3#.T2JX3GJWpss Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and scholarship==
Considering the rapid pace at which the fields of medicine and health science are developing, it becomes important to investigate the most proper and/or efficient methodologies for conducting research. On the whole, "the primary concern of the researcher must always be the [[phenomenon]], from which the research question is derived, and only subsequent to this can decisions be made as to the most appropriate research [[methodology]], design, and methods to fulfill the purposes of the research."&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Seaton, "Combining Interpretive Methodologies: Maximizing the Richness of Findings," ''Beyond Method: Philosophical Conversations in Healthcare Research and Scholarship'' Ed. Pamela M. Ironside (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), 217.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement on research methodology places the researcher at the forefront of his findings. That is, the researcher becomes the person who makes or breaks his or her scientific inquiries rather than the research itself. Even so, "interpretive research and scholarship are creative processes, and methods and methodology are not always singular, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', fixed and unchanging."&lt;ref&gt;Seaton, "Combining Interpretive Methodologies: Maximizing the Richness of Findings," 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, viewpoints on scientific inquiries into healthcare matters "will continue to grow and develop with the creativity and insight of interpretive researchers, as they consider emerging ways of investigating the complex social world."&lt;ref&gt;Seaton, "Combining Interpretive Methodologies: Maximizing the Richness of Findings," 217-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical trials===
{{Further|Clinical trials}}
Clinical trials are a means through which the healthcare industry tests a new drug, treatment, or medical device. The traditional methodology behind clinical trials consists of various phases in which the emerging product undergoes a series of intense tests, most of which tend to occur on interested and/or compliant patients. The U.S. government has an established network for tackling the emergence of new products in the healthcare industry. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) does not conduct trials on new drugs coming from [[pharmaceutical]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/7086fnl.htm Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Reviewers in Exploratory Drug Studies (FDA January 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the FDA, the [[National Institutes of Health]] sets the guidelines for all kinds of clinical trials relating to [[infectious diseases]]. For cancer, the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) sponsors a series or cooperative groups like [[CALGB]] and [[Children's Oncology Group|COG]] in order to standardize protocols for cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/overview/mission Mission Statement of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ogco fda 1006.jpg|thumb|right|300px|U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (2006)]]

===Quality assurance===
{{Further|Quality assurance}}
The primary purpose of quality assurance (QA) in healthcare is to ensure that the quality of patient care is in accordance with established guidelines. The government usually plays a significant role in providing structured guidance for treating a particular disease or ailment. However, protocols for treatment can also be worked out at individual healthcare institutions like hospitals and HMOs. In some cases, quality assurance is seen as a superfluous endeavor, as many healthcare-based QA organizations, like [[QARC]], are publicly funded at the hands of taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Quality Assurance Review Center"&gt;[http://www.qarc.org/ Quality Assurance Review Center]&lt;/ref&gt; However, many people would agree that healthcare quality assurance, particularly in the areas cancer treatment and disease control are necessary components to the vitality of any legitimate healthcare system. With respect to quality assurance in cancer treatment scenarios, the [[Quality Assurance Review Center]] (QARC) is just one example of a QA facility that seeks "to improve the standards of care" for patients "by improving the quality of clinical trials medicine."&lt;ref name="Quality Assurance Review Center"/&gt;

==Birth and death==

===Reproductive rights===
{{Further|Abortion}}
The [[ecophilosophy]] of [[Garrett Hardin]] is one perspective from which to analyze the reproductive rights of human beings. For the most part, Hardin argues that it is immoral to have large families, especially since they do a disservice to society by consuming an excessive amount of resources. In an essay titled ''[[The Tragedy of the Commons]]'', Hardin states,{{quotation|To couple the concept of [[liberty|freedom]] to breed with the belief that everyone born has an equal right to the commons is to lock the world into a tragic course of action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html Garrett Hardin, "Freedom to Breed is Intolerable," ''The Tragedy of the Commons'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} By encouraging the freedom to breed, the [[welfare state]] not only provides for children, but also sustains itself in the process. The net effect of such a policy is the inevitability of a [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

Hardin's ecophilosophy reveals one particular method to mitigate healthcare costs. With respect to population growth, the fewer people there are to take care of, the less expensive healthcare will be. And in applying this [[logic]] to what medical ethicist Leonard J. Weber previously suggested, less expensive healthcare does not necessarily mean poorer quality healthcare.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Birth and living===
{{Further|Eugenics}}
The concept of being "''well-born''" is not new, and may carry racist undertones. The [[Nazis]] practiced [[eugenics]] in order to cleanse the gene pool of what were perceived to be unwanted or harmful elements. This "race hygiene movement in Germany evolved from a [[theory]] of [[Social Darwinism]], which had become popular throughout Europe" and the United States during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Baumslag, ''Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, and Typhus'' (Westport: Praeger Publishers, 2005), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; A German phrase that embodies the nature of this practice is ''lebensunwertes Leben'' or "life unworthy of life."&lt;ref&gt;Baumslag, ''Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, and Typhus'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with healthcare philosophy, the theory of [[natural rights]] becomes a rather pertinent subject. After birth, man is effectively endowed with a series of natural rights that cannot be banished under any circumstances. One major proponent of natural rights theory was seventeenth-century English political philosopher [[John Locke]]. With regard to the natural rights of man, Locke states,{{quotation|If God's purpose for me on [[Earth]] is my survival and that of my species, and the means to that survival are my life, health, liberty and property — then clearly I don't want anyone to violate my rights to these things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/#HumNatGodPur John Locke, "Human Nature and God's Purposes," ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} Although partially informed by his [[religion|religious]] understanding of the world, Locke's statement can essentially be viewed as an affirmation of the right to preserve one's life at all costs. This point is precisely where healthcare as a [[human rights|human right]] becomes relevant.

The process of preserving and maintaining one's health throughout life is a matter of grave concern. At some point in every person's life, his or her health is going to decline regardless of all measures taken to prevent such a collapse. Coping with this inevitable decline can prove quite problematic for some people. For [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[René Descartes]], the depressing and gerontological implications of [[aging]] pushed him to believe in the prospects of [[immortality]] through a wholesome [[faith]] in the possibilities of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-modal/#PosHumFre René Descartes, "Possibility and Human Freedom," ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and dying===
{{Further|Euthanasia}}
One of the most basic human rights is the right to live, and thus, preserve one's life. Yet one must also consider the right to die, and thus, end one's life. Often, religious values of varying traditions influence this issue. Terms like "mercy killing" and "assisted suicide" are frequently used to describe this process. Proponents of [[euthanasia]] claim that it is particularly necessary for patients suffering from a terminal illness.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Callahan, "Terminating Life-Sustaining Treatment of the Demented," ''Bioethics'' Ed. John Harris (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 93.&lt;/ref&gt; However, opponents of a self-chosen death purport that it is not only immoral, but wholly against the pillars of reason.

In a certain philosophical context, death can be seen as the ultimate [[Existential crisis|existential]] moment in one's life. Death is the deepest cause of a primordial [[anxiety]] (''Die Anfechtung'') in a person's life. In this emotional state of anxiety, "the Nothing" is revealed to the person. According to twentieth-century [[Germans|German]] philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]],{{quotation|The Nothing is the complete negation of the totality of beings.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, "What Is Metaphysics?" ''Basic Writings'' Ed. David Krell (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1993), 98.&lt;/ref&gt;}} And thus, for Heidegger, humans finds themselves in a very precarious and fragile situation (constantly hanging over the [[abyss (religion)|abyss]]) in this world. This concept can be simplified to the point where at bottom, all that a person has in this world is his or her [[Being]]. Regardless of how individuals proceed in life, their existence will always be marked by [[wikt:finitude|finitude]] and [[solitude]]. When considering near-death experiences, humans feels this primordial anxiety overcome them. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to recognize the onset of this entrenched [[wiktionary:despair|despair]] in patients who are nearing their respective deaths.

Other philosophical investigations into death examine the healthcare's profession heavy reliance on science and technology (SciTech). This reliance is especially evident in Western medicine. Even so, Heidegger makes ang [[allusion]] to this reliance in what he calls the allure or "character of exactness."&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "What Is Metaphysics?," 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, people are inherently attached to "exactness" because it gives them a sense of purpose or reason in a world that is largely defined by what appears to be [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] and irrationality. And as the moment of death is approaching, a moment marked by utter confusion and fear, people frantically attempt to pinpoint a final sense of meaning in their lives.

Aside from the role that SciTech plays in death, [[palliative care]] constitutes a specialized area of healthcare philosophy that specifically relates to patients who are terminally ill. Similar to [[hospice]] care, this area of healthcare philosophy is becoming increasingly important as more patients prefer to receive healthcare services in their homes. Even though the terms "'''palliative'''" and "'''hospice'''" are typically used interchangeably, they are actually quite different. As a patient nears the end of his life, it is more comforting to be in a private home-like setting instead of a hospital. Palliative care has generally been reserved for those who have a [[terminal illness]]. However, it is now being applied to patients in all kinds of medical situations, including chronic fatigue and other distressing symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capc.org/palliative-care-across-the-continuum/ "Palliative Care across the Continuum" ''Center to Advance Palliative Care'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role development==
The manner in which nurses, physicians, patients, and administrators interact is crucial for the overall efficacy of a healthcare system. From the viewpoint of the patients, healthcare providers can be seen as being in a privileged position, whereby they have the power to alter the patients' quality of life. And yet, there are strict divisions among healthcare providers that can sometimes lead to an overall decline in the quality of patient care. When nurses and physicians are not on the same page with respect to a particular patient, a compromising situation may arise. Effects stemming from a "gender gap" between nurses and doctors are detrimental to the professional environment of a hospital workspace.&lt;ref&gt;Mary W. Stewart, "The Social Context of Professional Nursing," ''Role Development in Professional Nursing Practice'' Ed. Kathleen Masters (Sudbury: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005), 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''photosphere''' is a star's outer shell from which light is radiated. The term itself is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] roots, φῶς, φωτός/''phos, photos'' meaning "light" and σφαῖρα/''sphaira'' meaning "sphere", in reference to it being a spherical surface that is perceived to emit light. It extends into a star's surface until the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] becomes opaque, equivalent to an [[optical depth]] of approximately 2/3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
| author=Carroll 
| author2=Ostlie 
| last-author-amp=yes
| date=1996
| title=Modern Astrophysics
| publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]]
| location=
| id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or equivalently, a depth from which 50% of light will escape without being scattered.
In other words, a photosphere is the deepest region of a luminous object, usually a star, that is transparent to photons of certain [[wavelength]]s.

== Temperature ==

The surface of a star is defined to have a temperature given by the effective temperature in the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]. Stars, except [[neutron star]]s, have no solid surface.&lt;ref&gt;As of 2004, although white dwarfs are believed to crystallize from the middle out, none have fully solidified yet [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411199v1]; and only neutron stars are believed to have a solid, albeit unstable [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210207], crust [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/mnr/2004/00000351/00000003/art00021]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the photosphere is typically used to describe the [[Sun]]'s or another [[star]]'s visual surface .

== Composition of the Sun ==
The [[Sun]] is composed primarily of the chemical elements [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]; they account for 74.9% and 23.8% of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere, respectively. All heavier elements, called [[Metallicity|metals]] in astronomy, account for less than 2% of the mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.

== Sun ==
[[Image:Sun Atmosphere Temperature and Density SkyLab.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Solar atmosphere]]: temperature and density. See [[File talk:Sun Atmosphere Temperature and Density SkyLab.jpg|here]] for meanings of extra lines in the graph.]]

The [[Sun]]'s photosphere has a temperature between {{convert|4500|and|6000|K|°C|lk=in}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/sun.html The Sun – Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; (with an effective temperature of {{convert|5777|K|°C|lk=in}})&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050217044235/http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/sun_worldbook.html World Book at NASA – Sun]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[density]] somewhere around 1{{e|-3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://history.nasa.gov/SP-402/p2.htm | title = SP-402 A New Sun: The Solar Results From Skylab | author = John A. Eddy | year = 1979 | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Orders of magnitude (density)#-4|1]]{{e|-6}} [[kilogram|kg]]/[[cubic meter|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]];&lt;ref name="Stanford University"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://solar-center.stanford.edu/vitalstats.html| title=The Sun's Vital Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; other stars may have hotter or cooler photospheres. The Sun's photosphere is around 100 [[kilometer]]s thick, and is composed of [[convection cell]]s called [[Granule (solar physics)|granules]]—cells of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] each approximately 1000 [[kilometer]]s in diameter with hot rising plasma in the center and cooler plasma falling in the narrow spaces between them, flowing at velocities of 7 kilometer per second. Each granule has a lifespan of only about twenty minutes, resulting in a continually shifting "boiling" pattern. Grouping the typical granules are super granules up to 30,000 kilometers in diameter with lifespans of up to 24 hours and flow speeds of about 500 meter per second, carrying [[magnetic field]] bundles to the edges of the cells. Other magnetically-related phenomena include [[sunspot]]s and solar [[facula]]e dispersed between the granules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/feature1.shtml| title=NASA/Marshall Solar Physics| publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These details are too fine to be seen when observing other stars from earth.

== Other layers of the Sun ==

The Sun's visible atmosphere has other layers above the photosphere: the 2,000 kilometer-deep [[chromosphere]] (typically observed by filtered light, for example [[H-alpha]]) lies just between the photosphere and the much hotter but more tenuous [[corona]]. Other "surface features" on the photosphere are [[solar flare]]s and [[sunspot]]s.

A '''plant press''' is a set of equipment used by [[botanist]]s to flatten and dry field [[Sample (material)|sample]]s so that they can be easily stored. A professional plant press is made to the standard maximum size for [[biological specimen]]s to be filed in a particular [[herbarium]]. A '''flower press''' is a similar device of no standard size that is used to make flat dried flowers for [[pressed flower craft]].

Specimens prepared in a plant press are later glued to [[archival]]-quality [[card stock]] top their labels, and are filed in a [[herbarium]]. Labels are made with archival ink (or pencil) and paper, and attached with archival-quality glue.

==Construction==
[[File:Drying herbarium specimens.jpg|thumb|Filled plant presses arranged on a gas-fired heater, with air circulation upwards through the layers]]
A modern plant press consists of two strong outer boards with straps that can be tightened around them to exert pressure. Between the boards, fresh plant samples are placed, carefully labelled, between layers of paper. Further layers of absorbent paper and corrugated cardboard are usually added to help to dry the samples as quickly as possible, which prevents decay and improves colour retention. Layers of a sponge material can be used in order to prevent squashing parts of the specimens, such as fruit. Older plant presses and some modern flower presses have screws to supply the pressure, which often limits the thickness of the stack of samples that can be put into one press.

==History==
[[Luca Ghini]] (1490—1556)  Italian physician and botanist, created the first recorded herbarium, and is considered the first person to have used drying under pressure to prepare a plant collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.brit.org/brit-press/nctexasflora/specimens |title=Collecting Herbarium Specimens |publisher=Botanical Research Institute of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Withering]] English botanist, geologist, chemist and physician wrote popular books on [[Great Britain|British]] [[botany]], and by describing the screw-down plant press (and the [[vasculum]]) he brought it to the attention of amateur naturalists in Britain around 1770.&lt;ref name=Mygatt&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jane Mygatt |title=A Case for Collecting |journal=Iowa Native Plant Society Newsletter |year=2001 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=5–6 |url=http://www.herbarium.iastate.edu/inps/newsletters/October01.pdf |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rectal foreign bodies''' are large [[Foreign body|foreign items]] found in the [[rectum]] that can be assumed to have been inserted through the anus, rather than reaching the rectum via the mouth and gastrointestinal tract. It can be of clinical relevance if the patient cannot remove it the way they intended. Smaller, ingested foreign bodies, such as bones eaten with food, can sometimes be found stuck in the rectum upon x-ray and are rarely of clinical relevance.

Rectal foreign bodies are a subgroup of [[Foreign body in alimentary tract|foreign bodies in the alimentary tract]].&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Ayantunde, T. Oke: ''A review of gastrointestinal foreign bodies.'' In: ''Int J Clin Pract'' 60, 2006, S.&amp;nbsp;735–739. {{PMID|16805760}} (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID17556153"&gt;M. T. Smith, R. K. Wong: ''Foreign bodies.'' In: ''Gastrointest Endosc Clin N Am'' 17, 2007, S.&amp;nbsp;361–382. {{PMID|17556153}} (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frequency ==

There is no reliable data about the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of clinically meaningful foreign rectal bodies. It may have increased in the long term&lt;ref name="Munter2009"&gt;D. W. Munter: [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/776795-overview ''Foreign Bodies, Rectum.''] Vom 28. September 2009, abgerufen am 15. April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as it is observed more often in recent times.&lt;ref name="PMID18662236"&gt;N. Manimaran, M. Shorafa, J. Eccersley: ''Blow as well as pull: an innovative technique for dealing with a rectal foreign body.''

The incident rate is significantly higher for men than for women. The gender ratio is in the area of 28:1.&lt;ref name="Munter2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID15606596"&gt;D. L. Clarke u. a.: ''Colorectal foreign bodies.'' In: ''Colorectal Dis'' 7, 2005, S.&amp;nbsp;98–103. {{PMID|15606596}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. B. Stack, D. W.

Median age of the patients was 44.1 years, with a [[standard deviation]] of 16.6 years.&lt;ref name="PMID19895597"&gt;M. A. Kurer, C. Davey, S. Khan, S.

The first documented case dates from the 16th century.&lt;ref name="PMID18925957" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Haft, H. B.  Benjamin: ''Foreign bodies in the rectum: some psychosexual aspects.'' In: ''Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality'' 7, 1973, S.&amp;nbsp;74–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Reasons for foreign rectal bodies vary wildly, but in most cases they are of sexual or criminal motivation.&lt;ref name="Messmann2004"&gt;H. Messmann: ''Lehratlas der Koloskopie.'' Georg Thieme Verlag, 2004, {{ISBN|3-13-136441-6}}, S.&amp;nbsp;219. ISGN {{Google books|TCeklf42u0wC||page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreign body was inserted voluntarily in the vast majority of cases. This especially includes sexually motivated behaviour, encompassing the majority of cases. [[Bodypacking]], i.e. illegal transport of [[drugs]] within a body orfice (here: inside the rectum), is another – potentially – voluntary reason for insertion of foreign rectal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Laitenberger: [http://d-nb.info/978949625/34 ''Klinische und rechtsmedizinische Aspekte des intestinalen Rauschmitteltransportes in Hamburg 1989 bis 2004.''] Dissertation, Universität Hamburg, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes attempts to transport objects like weapons, including knives, or ammunition. According to one study, sexual stimulation was responsible for 80% of clinically relevant foreign rectal bodies. About 10% of the cases were due to sexual assault.&lt;ref name="PMID8908954"&gt;J. S. Cohen and J. M. Sackier: ''Management of colorectal foreign bodies.'' In: ''J Roy Coll Surg Edin'' 41, 1996, S.&amp;nbsp;312–315. {{PMID|8908954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rare cases, the patient inserted the object into the rectum without a way to remove it intending to receive attention and pity from doctors and nurses. This behaviour is categorized as [[Munchausen's syndrome]].&lt;ref name="PMID18925957"&gt;S. A. Khan u. a.: [http://www.casesjournal.com/content/1/1/243 ''Munchausen's syndrome presenting as rectal foreign body insertion: a case report.''] In: ''Cases J'' 1, 2008, 243. {{PMID|18925957}} ([[Open Access]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cause may be attempted self-treatment of diseases. One patient attempted to treat his chronic [[diarrhea]] by inserting an ear of [[maize]] into his rectum.&lt;ref&gt;V. Stenz u. a.: ''Fremdkörpergeschichten.'' In: ''Ther Umsch'' 65, 2008, S.&amp;nbsp;699–702. {{PMID|19048523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another patient tried to soothe the itching due to his [[hemorrhoids]] (''[[Pruritus ani]]'') with a [[toothbrush]]. The toothbrush went out of control and disappeared inside his anus.&lt;ref name="PMID11491473"&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. Kumar |date=July 2001 |title=Don't forget your toothbrush! |url=http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v191/n1/full/4801082a.html |journal=British Dental Journal |volume=191 |issue=1 |pages=27–28 |issn=0007-0610 |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4801082a |pmid=11491473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accidents or [[torture]] may cause an involuntary insertion of a foreign body.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nuschler u. a.: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110719103018/http://inef.uni-due.de/cms/files/report01.pdf ''Bericht über die internationale Folterfoschung.''] (PDF; 4,6&amp;nbsp;MB) Universität Duisburg, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; A mercury [[medical thermometer]] inserted into the anus in order to measure the temperature, but broke off while inside, is an example of a foreign rectal body due to an accident.&lt;ref name="PMID19444034"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=B. Azman |author2=B. Erku |author3=B. H. Güvenç |date=May 2009 |title=Balloon extraction of a retained rectal foreign body under fluoroscopy, case report and review |journal=Pediatric Emergency Care |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=345–347 |issn=1535-1815 |doi=10.1097/PEC.0b013e3181a3494f |pmid=19444034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greece knew the [[Rhaphanidosis]] as a punishment for male adulterers. It involved the insertion of a [[radish]] into the anus. Many self-inserted rectal bodies are stated as accidentally by the patients due to feelings of shame.

There are several reasons that contribute to the jamming of rectal bodies inside the rectum. Many of the objects used for sexual stimulation have a conical tip in order to facilitate penetration, while the base is flat. Extraction by the user may be impossible if the base of the object passed the anus towards the rectum. In order to receive a stronger stimulation, the object may be inserted deeper than intended. In this case, the [[sphincter]] prevents, by mechanical means, the extraction of the foreign body.&lt;ref name="PMID984928" /&gt;

== Objects ==
Type and size of the foreign rectal bodies are diverse and may exceed the anatomical-physiological imagination.&lt;ref name="Messmann2004" /&gt;

Objects documented in literature include:
* Razor, screw, screwdriver, small rolled tool bag (15×12&amp;nbsp;cm, including tools 620&amp;nbsp;g), [[hairpin]], [[milk can opener]]
* [[Fish bone]], bone splinters
* Different drug containers
* Short staffs, such as a 27&amp;nbsp;cm long chair leg, a 19&amp;nbsp;cm long [[spade]] handle and a broken off broom handle, extension parts for a vacuum cleaner
* Containers, sometimes exceeding 0.5&amp;nbsp;l in volume, e.g. sparkling wine bottles, bottles of Coca-Cola, jam pots, small beer glasses, cups
* Spray can, light bulb, [[vacuum tube]], candle
* [[Table tennis]] ball, [[Boccia]] ball
* [[Ammunition]], [[firecracker]]
* Cucumber, carrot, maize ear, banana, apples, onion, [[Figging|carved pieces of ginger]]

Not all objects are solid. In 1987, a case was documented of a patient who administered a [[cement]] [[enema]]. After it solified and impacted, the resulting block had to be surgically extracted.&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Stephens, M. L. Taff: ''Rectal impaction following enema with concrete mix.'' In: ''Am J Forensic Med Pathol'' 8, 1987, S.&amp;nbsp;179–182. {{PMID|3649167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another extreme case occurred in November 1953. A depressed man inserted a 15&amp;nbsp;cm long cardboard tube into his rectum and tossed a lighted firecracker into the tube's opening, resulting in a large hole in his rectum.&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Butters: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1980742/?tool=pubmed ''An unusual rectal injury.''] In: ''Br Med J'' 2, 1955, S.&amp;nbsp;602–603. {{PMID|13240191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Many patients feel ashamed during the [[Medical history|anamnesis]] and provide information only reluctantly. This may lead to missing information that may be important during therapy. For the same reason, patients may not visit a doctor until very late. Trusting and sensitive care for the ashamed and uncomfortable patients is paramount for a successful therapy&lt;ref name="PMID9887927"&gt;R. P. Mackinnon, G. Fulde: [http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/xmas98/mkinnon/mkinnon.html ''Removing rectal foreign bodies: is the ventouse gender specific?''] In: ''Med J Aust'' 169, 1998, S.&amp;nbsp;670–671. {{PMID|9887927}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be livesaving.&lt;ref&gt;E. Stein: ''Proktologie: Lehrbuch und Atlas.'' Verlag Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|3-540-43033-4}}, S.&amp;nbsp;329f. {{Google books|8yQAecJo5AoC||page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, several [[radiology|radiological]] images are recorded in order to pinpoint the precise place and depth of the foreign body. This is usually done by [[x-ray]]. Foreign bodies made from low-contrast material (e.g. plastics) may necessitate [[medical ultrasound]] or a [[CT scan]].&lt;ref name="PMID9887927" /&gt; [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] is [[contraindication|contraindicated]], especially if the foreign body is unknown. Foreign rectal bodies may penetrate deep into the colon, in certain circumstances up to the [[right colic flexure]].&lt;ref name="Messmann2004" /&gt;

An [[endoscopy]], which may also be of use during therapy, facilitates the identification and localisation of the object inside the rectum.&lt;ref name="Axon2004"&gt;A. T. R. Axon and M. Classen: ''Gastroenterologische Endoskopie.'' Georg Thieme Verlag, 2004, {{ISBN|3-13-132401-5}}, S.&amp;nbsp;400–401. {{Google books|6LtyFKwyCv4C||page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about the foreign body obtained in those ways are of high importance during therapy, as a [[perforation]] of the rectum or the anus is to be absolutely avoided.

== Therapy ==
[[File:Rectal foreign body 02.jpg|thumb|Endoscopic sling with the fragment of a glass bottle.]]
The therapeutic measures to remove the foreign body can be as diverse as the objects inside the rectum. In many instances, the foreign bodies consist of fragile materials, such as glass. Most patients wait for several hours or even days until they visit a doctor. Before they do, they often repeatedly try to remove the object themselves or by a layperson. This often worsens the situation for a successful extraction.

In most cases, the foreign body can be removed endoscopic. Vibrators, for example, can be often removed using a large sling usually used to remove [[polyp (medicine)|polyps]] during [[coloscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Hartmann u. a.: ''Notfallendoskopie – Update.'' In: ''Gastroenterologie up2date'' 5, 2009, S.&amp;nbsp;321–334. {{DOI|10.1055/s-0029-1215318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller objects like a [[medical thermometer]] can be removed by a biopsy forceps.&lt;ref name="PMID14703278"&gt;W. C. Huang u. a.: ''Retained rectal foreign bodies.'' In: ''J Chin Med Assoc'' 66, 2003, S.&amp;nbsp;607–612. {{PMID|14703278}}&lt;/ref&gt; A flexible endoscope can be of no help with large and jammed objects. It may be preferable to use rigid tools in those cases.&lt;ref name="Messmann2004" /&gt;

There have been several cases where instruments used in child birth have proven their worth for the removal of those foreign bodies, such as the [[forceps]]&lt;ref name="PMID1252815"&gt;T. N. Peet: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1638849/?page=1 ''Removal of impacted rectal foreign body with obstetric forceps.''] In: ''British Medical Journal'' 1976, S.&amp;nbsp;500–501. {{PMID|1252815}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ventouse|suction cups]].&lt;ref name="PMID8756851" /&gt;
Wooden objects have been retrieved with corkscrews and drinking glasses after filling them with [[plaster]].&lt;ref name="PMID1252815" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Bailey and J. Love: ''A short textbook of surgery.'' A. J. H. Rains and H. D. Ritchie (Herausgeber), 16th edition. Verlag Lewis, 1975, S.&amp;nbsp;1013.&lt;/ref&gt; A spoon can be used as an "anchor" by leaving it inside the glass during the plaster filling, removing it together with the glass.&lt;ref name="Spiegel1991" /&gt; Light bulbs are encased in a [[gauze]] shroud, shattered inside the rectum and extracted.&lt;ref name="Spiegel1991" /&gt;

There have been successful cases using [[Argon plasma coagulation|argon-plasma coagulation]]. The object in question was a green apple wraped in [[cellophane]] inside the rectum of a 44-year-old patient. The argon-beam coagulation shrunk the apple by more than 50%, enabling its removal. Previous extraction attempts using endoscopic tools failed due to the flat surface of the object.&lt;ref name="PMID9201486"&gt;J. Glaser u. a.: [https://www.thieme-connect.com/ejournals/pdf/endoscopy/doi/10.1055/s-2007-1004178.pdf ''Unusual rectum foreign body: Treatment using argon-beam coagulation.''] (PDF; 224&amp;nbsp;kB) In: ''Endoscopy'' 29, 1997, S.&amp;nbsp;230–231. {{PMID|9201486}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the object is too far up, in the area of the ''[[colon sigmoideum]]'', and cannot be removed using one of the above methods, bed rest and sedation can cause the object to descend back into the rectum, where retrieval and extraction are easier.&lt;ref name="PMID984928" /&gt;

In difficult cases, a [[laparotomy]] may be necessary. Statistically, this is the case in about 10 percent of patients.&lt;ref name="Messmann2004" /&gt; The large intestine can be manipulated inside the abdominal cavity, making it possible for it to wander in the direction of the anus and be grabbed there. A surgical opening of the large intestines can be indication in very difficult cases, especially if the manipulation of the object may pose a serious health risk. This may be the case with a jammed drug condom.&lt;ref name="Axon2004" /&gt;

=== Anaesthesia ===
Mild cases may need a [[sedation]] at most. [[Local anaesthesia|Local]] and [[spinal anaesthesia]] find common use. Difficult interventions may need [[general anaesthesia]]; surgical opening of the abdominal cavity or the colon require it. General anaesthesia can be beneficial for the relaxation of the [[sphincter]].&lt;ref name="Messmann2004" /&gt;

=== Aftercare ===
After the surgery, a [[sigmoidoscopy]] – a [[colonoscopy]] focused on the first 60&amp;nbsp;cm of the colon – is good practice in order to rule out possible perforation and injury of the rectum and the ''colon sigmoideum''.&lt;ref name="PMID18666334"&gt;J. J. Koornstra and R. K. Weersma: [http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/14/4403.asp ''Management of rectal foreign bodies: description of a new technique and clinical practice guidelines.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919143918/http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/14/4403.asp |date=2008-09-19 }} In: ''World J Gastroenterol'' 14, 2008, S.&amp;nbsp;4403–4406. {{PMID|18666334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stationary aftercare may be indicated.

== Possible consequences of a non-removed object ==
If the foreign body is too big to allow feces from the colon to pass, a mechanical [[ileus]] may occur. The distension of the rectum and the disruption of the [[Vasoconstriction|peristasis]] reinforce this effect.

The foreign body may cause infections, destroying the intestinal wall. Depending on the location of the perforation, this may lead to a [[peritonitis]] due to the feces or an [[abscess]] in the retroperitoneal space.

Smaller objects that injure the intestinal wall, but do not perforate it, may be encapsulated by a [[foreign body granuloma]]. They may remain in the rectum as a pseudotumor without any further effects.

== Complications ==
The most common – but still rare – [[complication (medicine)|complication]] is a perforation of the rectum caused by the foreign object itself or attempts to remove it. Diagnosed perforations are operated immediately by opening the [[abdomen]] and removal or [[surgical suturing|suturing]] of the perforated area. In order to suppress [[infections]], antibiotics are usually prescribed.&lt;ref name="PMID984928" /&gt; Often, a temporary [[ileostomy]] is necessary to protect the stitches.&lt;ref name="PMID8908954" /&gt; After a contrast medium applied by an enema proves the complete healing of the perforated area, the ileostomy is reversed. This usually takes between three and six months.
&lt;ref&gt;J. Ruiz del Castillo u. a.: ''Colorectal trauma caused by foreign bodies introduced during sexual activity: diagnosis and management.'' In: ''Rev Esp Enferm Dig'' 93, 2001, S.&amp;nbsp;631–634. {{PMID|11767487}} (Review)&lt;/ref&gt; Average hospitalization is 19 days.&lt;ref name="PMID984928" /&gt;

Medical literature describes some deaths due to rectal foreign bodies, but they are very rare and usually classified as [[autoerotic fatality]]. A 75-year-old patient died due to a rectal perforation caused by a [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]] person using a cane.&lt;ref&gt;N. Ikeda u. a.: ''Homicide by rectal insertion of a walking stick.'' In: ''Nihon Hoigaku Zasshi.'' Band 45, 1991, S.&amp;nbsp;341–344. {{PMID|1766149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another middle-aged patient died due to a rectal perforation by a vibrator. The perforation was sutured and the patient received intensive medical care, but he contracted [[Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome]] (ARDS) and [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] (SIRS) due to the trauma, resulting in [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]] (MODS) and death.&lt;ref&gt;N. G. Waraich u. a.: ''Vibrator-induced fatal rectal perforation.'' In: ''New Zealand Medical Journal.'' Band 120, 2007, S.&amp;nbsp;U2685. {{PMID|1772649}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a paper describing a death after a perforation with a [[shoehorn]].&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Byard u. a.: ''Unusual fatal mechanisms in nonasphyxial autoerotic death.'' In: ''Am Journal of Forensic Medical Pathology.'' Band 21, 2000, S.&amp;nbsp;65–68. {{PMID|10739230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rectum has to be nursed after a surgical procedure until healing is complete. A 54-year-old man, who had been operated on twice in order to remove a foreign body (a cucumber and a parsnip), died due to a [[peritonitis]] after he inserted two apples into the rectum before the wound had healed.&lt;ref name="Spiegel1991" /&gt;

== By oral intake ==
The other way for a foreign body to travel through the digestive system (after oral intake and passage through the entire intestines) happens very often, but is only rarely medically relevant. Other constriction, such as the [[esophagus]], [[cardia]], [[pylorus]] or [[ileocecal valve]] tend to cause issues with other organs, provided a foreign body is large enough to be an issue. Some foreign bodies may still pass those narrows and may cause medically relevant issues, i.e. toothpicks and bones.&lt;ref name="PMID17556153" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Munter2009" /&gt; Bones especially, i.e. from chickens, cause about half of all intestinal perforations.&lt;ref name="PMID1854398"&gt;D. H. Davies: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1285738/ ''A chicken bone in the rectum.''] In: ''Arch Emerg Med'' 8, 1991, S.&amp;nbsp;62–64. {{PMID|1854398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Manus: ''Perforation of the intestine by ingested foreign bodies.'' In: ''American Journal of Surgery'' 53, 1941, S.&amp;nbsp;392–397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant-based food, especially [[seeds]] like [[popcorn]],&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Roberge u. a.: ''Popcorn primary colonic phytobezoar.'' In: ''Ann Emerg Med'' 17, 1988, S.&amp;nbsp;77–79. {{PMID|3337421}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[watermelon]], [[sunflower seed|sunflower]] and [[pumpkin]] seed, may clump together inside the lower intestines to form [[bezoar]]s. Those may grow too big for normal anal passage, thus becoming clinically relevant. This kind of rectal foreign body happens chiefly in children, especially in [[Northern Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], where those seeds form an elemental part of the diet.&lt;ref&gt;A. Eitan u. a.: ''[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6WKP-4NX46MB-19-1&amp;_cdi=6912&amp;_user=582538&amp;_pii=S0022346807000929&amp;_orig=search&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F2007&amp;_sk=999579993&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkWA&amp;md5=15e313c025d4b95eae6975a89ce2fb8f&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf Fecal impaction in children: report of 53 cases of rectal seed bezoars.]'' In: ''J Pediatr Surg'' 42, 2007, S.&amp;nbsp;1114–1117. {{PMID|17560231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Mirza u. a.: ''Rectal bezoars due to pumpkin seeds.'' In: ''Trop Doct'' 39, 2009, S.&amp;nbsp;54–55. {{PMID|19211433}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In very rare cases, seeds inside a bezoar may germinate inside the lower intestines or the rectum, causing a blockade.&lt;ref&gt;F. Mahjoub u. a.: ''Invading plant material appearing as a colonic tumoural mass in a four-year-old girl.'' In: ''Trop Doct'' 39, 2009, S.&amp;nbsp;253–254. {{PMID|19762589}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In veterinary medicine ==
Foreign rectal bodies are rare in [[veterinary medicine]]. A passage through the entire intestines, followed by a stay inside the rectum is – as with humans – rare.&lt;ref&gt;C. B. Webb u. a.: ''Rectal strictures in 19 dogs: 1997–2005.'' In: ''JAVMA.'' Band 43, 2007, S. 332–336. {{PMID|17975215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals may have [[bezoar]]s out of different materials, which may migrate to the rectum and cause problems.&lt;ref&gt;N. D. Sargison u. a.: ''Intestinal obstruction in a blue-faced Leicester ram associated with a phytobezoar lodged at the pelvic inlet.'' In: ''Veterinary Record.'' Band 137, 1995, S. 222. {{PMID|7502475}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Atypical foreign rectal bodies in animals of both sexes may be caused by sexual or [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] abuse.&lt;ref&gt;H. M. C. Munro, M. V. Thrusfield: ''[http://canadianveterinarians.net/pdfs/Munro_SexualAbuse.pdf "Battered Pets": Sexual Abuse.''] In: ''Journal Of Small Animal Practice.'' Band 42, 2001, S. 333–337. {{PMID|11480898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ig Nobel Prize ==
The [[Ig Nobel Prize]] was awarded in 1995 to David B. Busch and James R. Starling from [[Madison, Wisconsin]] for their 1986 article ''Rectal foreign bodies: Case Reports and a Comprehensive Review of the World’s Literature''&lt;ref name="PMID3738771"&gt;D. B. Busch and J. R. Starling: ''Rectal foreign bodies: Case Reports and a Comprehensive Review of the World’s Literature.''

&lt;/ref&gt; It is the creation and processing of information by a group of people. As an academic field Social Information Processing studies the [[information processing]] power of networked [[social system]]s.

Typically computer tools are used such as:

* Authoring tools: e.g., [[blogs]]
* Collaboration tools: e.g., [[wikis]], in particular, e.g., [[Wikipedia]]
* Translating tools: [[Duolingo]], [[reCAPTCHA]]
* [[Tag (metadata)|Tagging]] systems (social bookmarking): e.g., [[del.icio.us]], [[Flickr]], [[CiteULike]]
* [[Social networking]]: e.g., [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], [[Essembly]]
* [[Collaborative filtering]]: e.g., [[Digg]], the [[Amazon.com|Amazon Product Recommendation System]], [[Yahoo! Answers]], [[Urtak]]

Although computers are often used to facilitate networking and collaboration, they are not required. For example the ''[[Trictionary]]'' in 1982 was entirely paper and pen based, relying on neighborhood social networks and libraries. The creation of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in the 19th century was done largely with the help of anonymous volunteers organized by help wanted adds in newspapers and slips of paper sent through the postal mail.

==Current state of knowledge==
The website for the AAAI 2008 Spring Symposium on Social Information Processing suggested the following topics and questions:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isi.edu/~lerman/sss07/&lt;/ref&gt;

; Tagging : [[Tag (metadata)|Tagging]] has already attracted the interest of the AI community. While the initial purpose of tagging was to help users organize and manage their own documents, it has since been proposed that collective tagging of common documents can be used to organize information via an informal classification system dubbed a [[folksonomy]]. There is hope{{Who|date=July 2011}} that folksonomies will eventually help fulfill the promise of the Semantic Web.

; [[Human-based computation]] and [[collective intelligence]] : What type of problems are amenable to human swarm computing approaches? How can we design the "[[wisdom of crowds]]" effect to benefit our problem solving needs?

; Incentives to [[online participation|participation]] : How to elicit quality metadata and content from users? How can users resistant to tagging be encouraged to tag content?

; [[Social networks]]: While users create social networks for a variety of reasons – e.g., to track lives of friends or work or opinions of the users they respect – network information is important for many applications. Globally, an [[information ecosystem]] may arise through the interactions among users, and between users and content. A community of users interested in a specific topic may emerge over time, with linkages to other communities giving insight into relationships between topics.

; Evolution of [[social media]] and information ecosystems : How does content, and its quality, change in time? There is increasing interest in peer-production systems, for example in how and why some open-source projects like Linux and Wikipedia are successful. Under what circumstances are user-generated content sites likely to succeed and what implications does this have for information-sharing and learning within communities?

; Algorithms : Before we can harness the power of the social information processing, we need new approaches to structured data analysis, specifically algorithms for synthesizing various types of [[metadata]]: e.g., social networks and tagging. Research in this area will provide a principled foundation for the development of new algorithms for [[social search]], [[information discovery]] and [[personalization]] and other approaches that exploit the power of the social information processing.

==Key concepts==
===Social Recommender Systems===
''Social overload'' corresponds to being imposed to high amount of information and interaction on social web. Social overload causes some challenges from the aspect of both social media websites and their users.&lt;ref name=Guy2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guy|first1=Ido|title=Social Recommender Systems|journal=Recommender Systems Handbook|date=1 January 2015|pages=511–543|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6_15|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6_15|publisher=Springer US|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users need to deal with high volume of information and to make decisions among different social network applications whereas social network sites try to keep their existing users and make their sites interesting to users. To overcome social overload, ''social recommender systems'' has been utilized to engage users in social media websites in a way that users receive more personalized content using recommendation techniques.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt; Social recommender systems are specific types of recommendation systems being designed for social media and utilizing new sort of data brought by it, such as likes, comments, tags and so on, to improve effectiveness of recommendations. Recommendation in social media have several aspects like recommendation of social media content, people, groups and tags.

==== Content ====
Social media lets users to provide feedback on the content produced by users of social media websites, by means of commenting on or liking the content shared by others and annotating their own-created content via tagging. This newly introduced metadata by social media helps to obtain recommendations for social media content with improved effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt; Also, social media lets to extract the explicit relationship between users such as friendship and people followed/followers. This provides further improvement on collaborative filtering systems because now users can have judgement on the recommendations provided based on the people they have relationships.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt; There have been studies showing the effectiveness of recommendation systems which utilize relationships among users on social media compared to traditional collaborative filtering based systems, specifically for movie and book recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinha|first=Rashmi|last2=Swearingen|first2=Kirsten|date=|year=2001|title=Comparing Recommendations Made by Online Systems and Friends|url=|journal=DELOS workshop: Personalisation and Recommender Systems in Digital Libraries|volume=106|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Golbeck|first=Jennifer|date=2006-05-16|title=Generating Predictive Movie Recommendations from Trust in Social Networks|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11755593_8|journal=Trust Management|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=93–104|doi=10.1007/11755593_8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another improvement brought by social media to recommender systems is solving the cold start problem for new users.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt;

Some key application areas of social media content recommendation are blog and blog post recommendation, multimedia content recommendation such as YouTube videos, question and answer recommendation to question askers and answerers on social  [[Comparison of Q&amp;A sites|question-and-answer websites]], job recommendation (LinkedIn), news recommendation on social new aggregator sites (like Digg, GoogleReader, Reddit etc.), short message recommendations on microblogs (such as Twitter).&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt;

==== People ====
Also known as ''social matching'' (the term is proposed by Terveen and McDonald), people recommender systems deal with recommending people to people on social media. Aspects making people recommender systems distinct from traditional recommender systems and require special attention are basically privacy, trust among users, and reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terveen|first=Loren|last2=McDonald|first2=David W.|date=2005-09-01|title=Social Matching: A Framework and Research Agenda|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1096737.1096740|journal=ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum. Interact.|volume=12|issue=3|pages=401–434|doi=10.1145/1096737.1096740|issn=1073-0516}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several factors which effect the choice of recommendation techniques for people recommendation on social networking sites (SNS). Those factors are related to types of relationships among people on social networking sites, such as symmetric vs asymmetric, ad-hoc vs long-term, and confirmed vs nonconfirmed relationships.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt;

The scope of people recommender systems can be categorized into three:&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt; recommending familiar people to connect with, recommending people to follow and recommending strangers. Recommending strangers is seen as valuable as  recommending familiar people because of leading to chances such as exchanging ideas, obtaining new opportunities, and increasing one’s reputation.

====Challenges ====
Handling with social streams is one of the challenges social recommender systems face with.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt; Social stream can be described as the user activity data pooled on newsfeed on social media websites. Social stream data has unique characteristics such as rapid flow, variety of data (only text content vs heterogenous content), and requiring freshness. Those unique properties of stream data compared to traditional social media data impose challenges on social recommender systems.
Another challenge in social recommendation is performing cross-domain recommendation, as in traditional recommender systems.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt; The reason is that social media websites in different domains include different information about users, and merging information within different contexts may not lead to useful recommendations. For example, using favorite recipes of users in one social media site may not be a reliable source of information to effective job recommendations for them.

===Social awareness===

Participation of people in online communities, in general, differ from their participatory behavior in real-world collective contexts. Humans in daily life are used to making use of "social cues" for guiding their decisions and actions e.g. if a group of people is looking for a good restaurant to have lunch, it is very likely that they will choose to enter to a local that have some customers inside instead of one that it is empty (the more crowded restaurant could reflect its popularity and in consequence, its quality of service). However, in online social environments, it is not straightforward how to access to these sources of information which are normally being logged in the systems, but this is not disclosed to the users.

There are some theories that explain how this social awareness can affect the behavior of people in real-life scenarios. The American philosopher [[George Herbert Mead]] states that humans are social creatures, in the sense that people's actions cannot be isolated from the behavior of the whole collective they are part of because every individuals' act are influenced by larger social practices that act as a general behavior's framework.&lt;ref name="Mead1934"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind, Self, and Society: From the Standpoint of a Social Behaviorist|last=Mead|first=George. H.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1934|isbn=|location=Chicago|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his performance framework, the Canadian sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] postulates that in everyday social interactions individuals perform their actions by collecting information from others first, in order to know in advance what they may expect from them and in this way being able to plan how to behave more effectively.&lt;ref name="Goffman 1990 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Goffman | first=Erving | title=The presentation of self in everyday life | publisher=Penguin | location=London | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-14-013571-8 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Benefits====

In the same way that in the real-world, providing social cues in virtual communities can help people to understand better the situations they face in these environments, to alleviate their decision-making processes by enabling their access to more informed choices, to persuade them to participate in the activities that take place there, and to structure their own schedule of individual and group activities more efficiently.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ding|first1=Xianghua|last2=Erickson|first2=Thomas|last3=Kellogg|first3=Wendy A.|last4=Patterson|first4=Donald J.|title=Informing and performing: investigating how mediated sociality becomes visible|journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing|volume=16|issue=8|year=2011|pages=1095–1117|issn=1617-4909|doi=10.1007/s00779-011-0443-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this frame of reference, an approach called "social context displays" has been proposed for showing social information -either from real or virtual environments- in digital scenarios. It is based on the use of graphical representations to visualize the presence and activity traces of a group of people, thus providing users with a third-party view of what is happening within the community i.e. who are actively participating, who are not contributing to the group efforts, etc. This social-context-revealing approach has been studied in different scenarios (e.g. IBM video-conference software, large community displaying social activity traces in a shared space called NOMATIC*VIZ), and it has been demonstrated that its application can provide users with several benefits, like providing them with more information to make better decisions and motivating them to take an active attitude towards the management of  their self and group representations within the display through their actions in the real-life.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"/&gt;

====Concerns====

By making the traces of activity of users publicly available for others to access it is natural that it can raise users concerns related to which are their rights over the data they generate, who are the final users that can have access to their information and how they can know and control their privacy policies.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"/&gt; There are several perspectives that try to contextualize this privacy issue. One perspective is to see privacy as a tradeoff between the degree of invasion to the personal space and the number of benefits that the user could perceive from the social system by disclosing their online activity traces.&lt;ref name="PatilLai2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patil|first1=Sameer|last2=Lai|first2=Jennifer|title=Who gets to know what when: configuring privacy permissions in an awareness application|year=2005|pages=101|doi=10.1145/1054972.1054987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another perspective is examining the concession between the visibility of people within the social system and their level of privacy, which can be managed at an individual or at a group level by establishing specific permissions for allowing others to have access to their information. Other authors state that instead of enforcing users to set and control privacy settings, social systems might focus on raising their awareness about who their audiences are so they can manage their online behavior according to the reactions they expect from those different user groups.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4196">A '''sudden ionospheric disturbance''' ('''SID''') is an abnormally high '''ionization/[[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]'''  density in the [[D region]] of the [[ionosphere]] caused by a [[solar flare]]. The SID results in a sudden increase in radio-wave absorption that is most severe in the upper [[medium frequency]] (MF) and lower [[high frequency]] (HF) ranges, and as a result often interrupts or interferes with [[telecommunication]]s systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Standard 1037C]] ''Glossary of Telecommunications Terms'', http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm, retrieved 2011 Dec 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The ''Dellinger effect'', or sometimes ''Mögel–Dellinger effect'', is another name for a sudden ionospheric disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was discovered by [[John Howard Dellinger]] around 1935 and also described by the German physicist [[Hans Mögel]] (1900-1944) in 1930.  The fadeouts are characterized by sudden onset and a recovery that takes minutes or hours.

==Cause==
When a solar flare occurs on the [[Sun]] a blast of intense [[ultraviolet]] and [[x-ray]] radiation hits the dayside of the Earth after a propagation time of about 8 minutes. This high energy [[radiation]] is absorbed by atmospheric particles, raising them to excited states and knocking [[electron]]s free in the process of [[photoionization]]. The low altitude ionospheric layers ([[D region]] and [[E region]]) immediately increase in density over the entire dayside. The ionospheric disturbance enhances VLF radio propagation. Scientists on the ground can use this enhancement to detect solar flares; by monitoring the signal strength of a distant VLF transmitter, sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) are recorded and indicate when solar flares have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aavso.org/observing/programs/solar/sid.shtml AAVSO: SIDs - Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The small geomagnetic effect in the lower ionosphere appears as a small hook on magnetic records and is therefore called "geomagnetic crochet effect" or "sudden field effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Bartels, J | author2=Bartels, J., (editor.) | author3=SpringerLink (Online service) | title=Geophysik III | publication-date=1967 | publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg | page=362 | isbn=978-3-642-46082-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on radio waves==
Short wave radio waves (in the [[High frequency|HF]] range) are absorbed by the increased particles in the low altitude [[ionosphere]] causing a complete blackout of radio communications. This is called a [[short wave]] [[fading]]. These fadeouts last for a few minutes to a few hours and are most severe in the equatorial regions where the Sun is most directly overhead. The ionospheric disturbance enhances long wave ([[Very low frequency|VLF]]) radio propagation. SIDs are observed and recorded by monitoring the signal strength of a distant VLF [[transmitter]].
A whole array of sub-classes of SIDs exist, detectable by different techniques at various wavelengths: the SPA (Sudden Phase Anomaly), SFD (Sudden Frequency Deviation), SCNA (Sudden Cosmic Noise Absorption), SEA (Sudden Enhancement of Atmospherics), etc.

This village, in Kasi district of Laos, was the site of the first SSR program in Laos. It was set up by Big Brother Mouse, which publishes and distributes books to promote reading and literacy, with an emphasis on easy and fun books that children are eager to read.]]'''Sustained silent reading''' ('''SSR''') is a form of school-based recreational reading, or '''free voluntary reading''', where students read silently in a designated time period every day in school.  An underlying assumption of SSR is that students learn to read by reading constantly. Successful models of SSR typically allow students to select their own books and require neither testing for comprehension nor book reports.  Schools have implemented SSR under a variety of names, such as "Drop Everything and Read (DEAR)", "Free Uninterrupted Reading (FUR)", or "Uninterrupted sustained silent reading (USSR)".

==Value of Sustained silent reading==

===Advocates' perspective===
According to advocates such as [[Stephen Krashen]], SSR has been shown to lead to gains in several literacy domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krashen|first=Stephen|title=False Claims About Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, Skills vs. Whole Language, and Recreational Reading|url=http://www.nochildleft.com/2003/may03reading.html|publisher=No Child Left|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krashen looked at a large number of studies to see what conclusions were supported by empirical evidence.

He found that in respect to reading comprehension, SSR is successful; 51 of 54 studies found that students in an SSR program scored as well as, or better than, other students in this regard. It is most successful when used for longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, S. 2007. "Extensive reading in English as a foreign language by adolescents and young adults: A meta-analysis." ''International Journal of Foreign Language Teaching'' 3(2): 23-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, SSR was shown to create a reading habit. Several years after participating in a program, students reported more reading.&lt;ref&gt;Greaney, V., and M. Clarke. 1973. "A longitudinal study of the effects of two reading methods on leisure-time reading habits." In ''Reading: What of the future?'' ed. D. Moyle. London: United Kingdom Reading Association, pp. 107-14, cited in ''Free Voluntary Reading'' by Stephen Krashen.&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that a single SSR session was enough to change attitudes about reading. Long-term effects of SSR include better vocabularies, better writing skills, better spelling, and greater knowledge of literature, science, and "practical knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, Stephen D., 2011. ''Free Voluntary Reading.'' Santa Barbara: Libraries Unlimited, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies noted that children in poor neighborhoods had less access to books at home and in libraries, and often the books available to them were not books that they wanted to read.&lt;ref&gt;Worthy, J., M. Moorman, and M. Turner. 1999. What Johnny likes to read is hard to find in school. Reading Research Quarterly 34(10): 12-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Prize-winning books were often not especially popular with children. Comic books, on the other hand, are often not available in libraries, but are popular with many boys, and reading comics was found to increase reading of other books.&lt;ref&gt;Ujiie, J., and S. Krashen. 1996. Is comic book reading harmful? Comic book reading, school achievement, and pleasure reading among seventh graders. California School Library Association Journal 19(2): 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three studies showed that providing rewards for reading did not improve reading development. Krashen believes this is because the presence of a reward suggests that an activity is work, and makes it less appealing.&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, Stephen D., 2011. ''Free Voluntary Reading.'' Santa Barbara: Libraries Unlimited, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In two studies, teachers noted fewer discipline problems when an SSR program was being used.&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, Stephen D., 2011. ''Free Voluntary Reading.'' Santa Barbara: Libraries Unlimited, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates also point out that students in SSR programs have more positive attitudes toward reading than students who do not participate in SSR programs.

===National Reading Panel analysis of sustained silent reading studies===
The [[National Reading Panel]] (NRP) in the United States meta-analyzed all quasi-experimental and experimental studies of SSR and challenged the claim that SSR has positive effects. The panel stated that the literature contained insufficient numbers of quasi-experimental or experimental studies on SSR to validate its use as a sound educational practice. The panel also noted that the absence of quantitative evidence was not evidence against the practice in itself.  They recommended further study of SSR.

Jim Trelease is one of many reading advocates who has disputed the impartiality of these findings. He points out that the NRP included only 14 research tests in their summary, out of 54 studies he identified that might have been used. In 10 of the studies used by NRP, SSR students performed the same as other students, and in 4 studies, SSR students did better.&lt;ref&gt;Trelease, Jim, ''The Read-Aloud Handbook'' Penguin Books, 2006. E-book version, no page reference available.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some argue the NRP is not impartial at all. In fact, the NRP only included studies that were verifiable and with scientifically credible designs. The NRP had rigorous guidelines for the studies it would include. For example, the NRP did not include studies without control groups. The fact that the NRP only analyzed 14 SSR studies, shows that the other studies were not scientifically credible. 

In the full group of 54 studies, SSR students performed better in 25, worse in 3, and the same in 24. SSR students scored worse only in short-term studies of less than 7 months. In studies that lasted one year or longer, SSR students did better in 8 of 10, and there was no difference in the other two. The NRP found that most of the SSR studies were not valid or verifiable. Many studies were simply correlational. Thus, only 14 studies actually followed guidelines that could make them statistically significant. Of these studies, SSR was found ineffective.  

"Where do these negative SSR feelings come from?" Trelease asks. "Perhaps from the wonderful folks who make all those workbooks, textbooks, and score sheets that wouldn't be bought and used in class during the time students were lounging around reading books, magazines, and newspapers and getting so good at reading they might need even fewer of those sheets next year." There is some support for this charge: A blog titled "Why Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) Doesn't Work" is posted by the publisher of four workbooks that sell for $89.99 each.&lt;ref&gt;http://penningtonpublishing.com/blog/reading/why-sustained-silent-reading-ssr-doesn’t-work/ accessed August 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, SSR was found ineffective by the NRP, not by publishing companies.

==Sustained silent reading practices==
A range of practices have been associated with SSR, and some advocates suggest that teacher models of reading behavior (i.e., teachers read while the students read), a long-term commitment to SSR, availability of multiple level, high-interest texts, and a sense of reading community are particularly relevant.

==Free voluntary reading (FVR)==
'''Free voluntary reading''' ('''FVR''') or '''recreation reading''', related to the [[comprehensible input|comprehension hypothesis]], is an educational theory that says many student gains in reading can be encouraged by giving them time to read what they want without too many evaluative measures.  Sustained silent reading is a method of implementing recreational and FVR theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29689">'''Task allocation and partitioning''' refers to the way that tasks are chosen, assigned, subdivided, and coordinated (here, within a single colony of social insects). Closely associated are issues of [[communication]] that enable these actions to occur.
This entry focuses exclusively on [[social insects]]. For information on human task allocation and partitioning, see [[division of labour]], [[task analysis]], and [[workflow]].

==Definitions==
*'''Task allocation''' "... is the process that results in specific workers being engaged in specific tasks, in numbers appropriate to the current situation. [It] operates without any central or hierarchical control..."&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Deborah M. Gordon |year=1996 |title=The organization of work in social insect colonies |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=380 |pages=121–124 |url=http://www.stanford.edu/~dmgordon/Gordon1996_Nature.pdf |format=PDF |pmid= |doi=10.1038/380121a0 |issue=6570 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729191717/http://www.stanford.edu/~dmgordon/Gordon1996_Nature.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of task allocation is individual-centric. It focuses on decisions by individuals about what task to perform. However, different biomathematical models give different weights to inter-individual interactions vs. environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt;
*'''Task partitioning''' refers to the division of one task into sequential actions done by more than one individual.&lt;ref name="Ratnieks"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Francis L. W.

For example, "hygienic behavior" is a task in which worker bees uncap and remove diseased brood cells that may be affected by American foulbrood (Paenibacillus larvae) or the parasitic mite Varroa destructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arathi | first1 = H.

Therefore, the task is partitioned, and performed by multiple individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arathi | first1 = H.

==Introduction==
Social living provides a multitude of advantages to its practitioners, including predation risk reduction, environmental buffering, food procurement, and possible mating advantages. The most advanced form of sociality is [[eusociality]], characterized by overlapping generations, cooperative care of the young, and reproductive division of labor, which includes sterility or near-sterility of the overwhelming majority of colony members. With few exceptions, all the practitioners of eusociality are insects of the orders Hymenoptera ([[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s), Isoptera ([[termite]]s), Thysanoptera ([[thrips]]), and Hemiptera ([[aphid]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=John R. Krebs  |author2=Nicholas B.

Social insects have been extraordinarily successful ecologically and evolutionarily. This success has at its most pronounced produced colonies 1) having a persistence many times the lifespan of most individuals of the colony, and 2) numbering thousands or even millions of individuals.
Social insects can exhibit division of labor with respect to non-reproductive tasks, in addition to the aforementioned reproductive one. In some cases this takes the form of markedly different, alternative morphological development ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]), as in the case of soldier castes in ants, termites, thrips, and aphids, while in other cases it is age-based (temporal polyethism), as with [[honey bee]] foragers, who are the oldest members of the colony (with the exception of the queen).  Evolutionary biologists are still debating the fitness-advantage gained by social insects due to their advanced division of labor and task allocation, but hypotheses include: increased resilience against a fluctuating environment, reduced energy costs of continuously switching tasks, increased longevity of the colony as a whole, or reduced rate of pathogen transmission.&lt;ref name="Duarte, A. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duarte | first1 = A. | last2 = Pen | first2 = I. | last3 = Keller | first3 = L. | last4 = Weissing | first4 = F.

Division of labor, large colony sizes, temporally-changing colony needs, and the value of adaptability and efficiency under Darwinian competition, all form a theoretical basis favoring the existence of evolved communication in social insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Carl Anderson  |author2=Daniel W.

==Worker Polymorphism==
One of the most well known mechanisms of task allocation is worker polymorphism, where workers within a colony have morphological differences. This difference in size is determined by the amount of food workers are fed as larvae, and is set once workers emerge from their pupae. Workers may vary just in size (monomorphism) or size and bodily proportions (allometry).  An excellent example of the monomorphism is in bumblebees (''Bombus'' spp.). Bumblebee workers display a large amount of body size variation which is normally distributed. The largest workers may be ten times the mass of the smallest workers. Worker size is correlated with several tasks: larger workers tend to forage, while smaller workers tend to perform brood care and nest thermoregulation. Size also affects task efficiency. Larger workers are better at learning, have better vision, carry more weight, and fly at a greater range of temperatures. However, smaller workers are more resistant to starvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Couvillon|first=MJ|author2=Jandt JM |author3=Duong NHI |author4=A Dornhaus |title=Ontogeny of worker body size distribution in bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) colonies|journal=Ecological Entomology|year=2010|volume=35|pages=424–435|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.2010.01198.x |pmc=4444232}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other eusocial insects as well, worker size can determine what polymorphic role they become.  For instance, larger workers in ''[[Myrmecocystus mexicanus]]'' (a North America species of honeypot ant) tend to become repletes, or workers so engorged with food that they become immobile and act a living food storage for the rest of the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rissing | first1 = Steven W | year = 1984 | title = Replete Caste Production and Allometry of Workers in the Honey Ant, ''Myrmecocystus mexicanus'' Wesmael (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) | url = | journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society | volume = 57 | issue = 2| pages = 347–350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ants and termites, on the other hand, workers vary in both size and bodily proportions, which have a bimodal distribution. This is present in approximately one in six ant genera. In most of these there are two developmentally distinct pathways, or castes, into which workers can develop. Typically members of the smaller caste are called minors and members of the larger caste are called majors or soldiers. There is often variation in size within each caste. The term soldiers may be apt, as in ''Cephalotes'', but in many species members of the larger caste act primarily as foragers or food processors. In a few ant species, such as certain ''Pheidole'' species, there is a third caste, called supersoldiers.

==Temporal polyethism==
Temporal polyethism is a mechanism of task allocation, and is ubiquitous among eusocial insect colonies. Tasks in a colony are allocated among workers based on their age. Newly emerged workers perform tasks within the nest, such as brood care and nest maintenance, and progress to tasks outside the nest, such as foraging, nest defense, and corpse removal as they age. In honeybees, the youngest workers exclusively clean cells, which is then followed by tasks related to brood care and nest maintenance from about 2–11 days of age. From 11– 20 days, they transition to receiving and storing food from foragers, and at about 20 days workers begin to forage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas D. Seeley |year=1982 |title=Adaptive significance of the age polyethism schedule in honeybee colonies |journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=287–293 |jstor=4599548 |doi=10.1007/BF00299306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar temporal polyethism patterns can be seen in primitive species of wasps, such as ''Ropalidia marginata'' as well as the eusocial wasp [[Vespula germanica]]. Young workers feed larvae, and then transition to nest building tasks, followed by foraging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dhruba Naug  |author2=Raghavendra Gadagkar  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998 |title=The role of age in temporal polyethism in a primitively eusocial wasp |journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=37–47 |jstor=4601416 |doi=10.1007/s002650050409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species of ants also display this pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=[[Bert Hölldobler]] &amp; [[E. O. Wilson]] |year=1990 |title=[[The Ants]] |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=0-674-04075-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern is not rigid, though. Workers of certain ages have strong tendencies to perform certain tasks, but may perform other tasks if there is enough need. For instance, removing young workers from the nest will cause foragers, especially younger foragers, to revert to tasks such as caring for brood.&lt;ref name="Muscedere 2009 911–918"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muscedere|first=ML|author2=Willey TA |author3=Traniello JFA |title=Age and task efficiency in the ant Pheidole dentata: young minor workers are not specialist nurses|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=2009|volume=77|pages=911–918|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.12.018|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes in task preference are caused by epigenetic changes over the life of the individual. Honeybee workers of different ages show substantial differences in DNA methylation, which causes differences in gene expression. Reverting foragers to nurses by removing younger workers causes changes in DNA methylation similar to younger workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herb|first=BR|author2=Wolschin F |author3=Hansen K |author4=Aryee MJ |author5=Langmead B |author6=Irizarry R |author7=Amdam GV |author8=AP Feinbert |title=Reversible switching between epigenetic states in honeybee behavioral subcastes|journal=Nature Neuroscience|year=2012|volume=15|pages=1371–1375|doi=10.1038/nn.3218|issue=10 |pmid=22983211 |pmc=3518384}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Temporal polyethism is not adaptive because of maximized efficiency; indeed older workers are actually more efficient at brood care than younger workers in some ant species.&lt;ref name="Muscedere 2009 911–918"/&gt; Rather it allows workers with the lowest remaining life expectancy to perform the most dangerous tasks. Older workers tend to perform riskier tasks, such as foraging, which has high risks of predation and parasitism, while younger workers perform less dangerous tasks, such as brood care. If workers experience injuries, which shortens their life expectancies, they will start foraging sooner than healthy workers of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuszewska|first=K|author2=Woyciechowski M |title=Reversion in honeybee, Apis mellifera, workers with different life expectancies|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=2012|volume=85|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.10.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response-Threshold Model==
A dominant theory of explaining the self-organized division of labor in social insect societies such as honey bee colonies is the Response-Threshold Model.  It predicts that individual worker bees have inherent thresholds to stimuli associated with different tasks.  Individuals with the lowest thresholds will preferentially perform that task.&lt;ref name="Duarte, A. 2012"/&gt;  Stimuli could include the “search time” that elapses while a foraging bee waits to unload her nectar and pollen to a receiver bee at the hive, the smell of diseased brood cells, or any other combination of environmental inputs that an individual worker bee encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thenius | first1 = R. | last2 = Schmickl | first2 = T. | last3 = Crailsheim | first3 = K. | year = 2008 | title = Optimisation of a honeybee-colony's energetics via social learning based on queuing delays | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 193–210 | doi=10.1080/09540090802091982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Response-Threshold Model only provides for effective task allocation in the honey bee colony if thresholds are varied among individual workers.  This variation originates from the considerable genetic diversity among worker daughters of a colony due to the queen’s multiple matings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tarapore | first1 = D. | last2 = Floreano | first2 = D. | last3 = Keller | first3 = L. | year = 2010 | title = Task-dependent influence of genetic architecture and mating frequency on division of labour in social insect societies | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 675–684 | doi=10.1007/s00265-009-0885-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network representation of information flow and task allocation==
To explain how colony-level complexity arises from the interactions of several autonomous individuals, a [[Biological network|network]]-based approach has emerged as a promising area of social insect research. Social insect colonies can be viewed as a self-organized network, in which interacting elements (i.e. [[Node (networking)|nodes]]) communicate with each other. As decentralized networks, colonies are capable of distributing information rapidly which facilitates robust responsiveness to their dynamic environments.&lt;ref name="sciencemag"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer H. Fewell |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/301/5641/1867.short |title=Social Insect Networks |publisher=[[Science (magazine)|Science]] |date=2003-09-26 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The efficiency of information flow is critical for colony-level flexibility because worker behavior is not controlled by a centralized leader but rather is based on local information.

Social insect networks are often non-randomly distributed, wherein a few individuals act as ‘hubs,’ having disproportionately more connections to other nestmates than other workers in the colony.&lt;ref name="sciencemag" /&gt; In harvester ants, the total interactions per ant during recruitment for outside work is right-skewed, meaning that some ants are more highly connected than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://171.66.127.193/content/8/64/1562.full.pdf+html |title=The effect of individual variation on the structure and function of interaction networks in harvester ants |publisher=171.66.127.193 |date=2011-11-07 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer simulations of this particular interaction network demonstrated that inter-individual variation in connectivity patterns expedites information flow among nestmates.

Task allocation within a social insect colony can be modeled using a network-based approach, in which workers are represented by nodes, which are connected by edges that signify inter-node interactions.  Workers performing a common task form highly connected clusters, with weaker links across tasks. These weaker, cross-task connections are important for allowing task-switching to occur between clusters.&lt;ref name="sciencemag" /&gt; This approach is potentially problematic because connections between workers are not permanent, and some information is broadcast globally, e.g. through pheromones, and therefore does not rely on interaction networks. One alternative approach to avoid this pitfall is to treat tasks as nodes and workers as fluid connections.

To demonstrate how time and space constraints of individual-level interactions affect colony function, social insect network approaches can also incorporate spatiotemporal dynamics. These effects can impose upper bounds to information flow rate in the network. For example, the rate of information flow through '' [http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Temnothorax_rugatulus Temnothorax rugatulus] '' ant colonies is slower than would be predicted if time spent traveling and location within the nest were not considered.&lt;ref name="plosone"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0020298 |title=Time-Ordered Networks Reveal Limitations to Information Flow in Ant Colonies |journal=PLOS ONE |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2013-11-26 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0020298 |volume=6 |pages=e20298 |pmid=21625450 |pmc=3098866 | last1 = Blonder | first1 = B | last2 = Dornhaus | first2 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In  ''Formica fusca'' L. ant colonies, a network analysis of spatial effects on feeding and the regulation of food storage revealed that food is distributed heterogeneously within colony, wherein heavily loaded workers are located centrally within the nest and those storing less food were located at the periphery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/26/7/2725.full.pdf+html |title=Collective regulatory stock management and spatiotemporal dynamics of the food flow in ants |publisher=[[The FASEB Journal]] |date=2012-07-01 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of inter-nest pheromone trail networks maintained by super-colonies of Argentine ants (''[http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Linepithema_humile Linepithema humile]'') have shown that different colonies establish networks with very similar topologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/62/1298.full.pdf+html |title=Structure and formation of ant transportation networks |publisher=[[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]] |date=2011-09-07 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Insights from these analyses revealed that these networks – which are used to guide workers transporting brood, workers and food between nests – are formed through a pruning process, in which individual ants initially create a complex network of trails, which are then refined to eliminate extraneous edges, resulting in a shorter, more efficient inter-nest network.

Long-term stability of interaction networks has been demonstrated in ''[http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Odontomachus_hastatus Odontomachus hastatus]'' ants, in which initially highly connected ants remain highly connected over an extended time period.&lt;ref name="Jeanson"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeanson, R |year=2012 |title=Long-term dynamics in proximity networks in ants |journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] |volume=83 |pages=915–923 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, ''[http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Temnothorax_rugatulus Temnothorax rugatulus]'' ant workers are not persistent in their interactive role, which might suggest that social organization is regulated differently among different eusocial species.&lt;ref name="plosone" /&gt;

A network is pictorially represented as a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], but can equivalently be represented as an [[adjacency list]] or [[adjacency matrix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael Goodrich &amp; [[Roberto Tamassia]] |year=2002 |title=Algorithm Design |publisher=Wiley |page=296 |isbn=978-0-471-38365-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, workers are the nodes of the graph, but Fewell prefers to make the tasks the nodes, with workers as the links.&lt;ref name="Fewell J 1870"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jennifer H.

# It increases both the physical and temporal reach of information. With connectivity, information can travel farther and faster, and additionally can persist longer, including both direct persistence (i.e. through pheromones), memory effects, and by initiating a sequence of events.
# It can help overcome task inertia and burnout, and push workers into performing hazardous tasks. For reasons of indirect fitness, this latter stimulus should not be necessary if all workers in the colony are highly related genetically, but that is not always the case.
# Key individuals may possess superior knowledge, or have catalytic roles. Examples, respectively, are a sentry who has detected an intruder, or the colony queen.
O'Donnell provides a comprehensive survey, with examples, of factors that have a large bearing on worker connectivity.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"/&gt; They include:
* [[Degree (graph theory)|graph degree]]
* size of the interacting group, especially if the network has a modular structure
* sender distribution (i.e. a small number of controllers vs. numerous senders)
* strength of the interaction effect, which includes strength of the signal sent, recipient sensitivity, and signal persistence (i.e. pheromone signal vs. sound waves)
* recipient memory, and its decay function
* socially-transmitted inhibitory signals, as not all interactions provide positive stimulus
* specificity of both the signal and recipient response
* signal and sensory modalities, and activity and interaction rates

==Task taxonomy and complexity==
Anderson, Franks, and McShea have broken down insect tasks (and subtasks) into a hierarchical [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; their focus is on task partitioning and its complexity implications. They classify tasks as individual, group, team, or partitioned; classification of a task depends on whether there are multiple vs. individual workers, whether there is division of labor, and whether subtasks are done concurrently or sequentially. Note that in their classification, in order for an action to be considered a task, it must contribute positively to inclusive fitness; if it must be combined with other actions to achieve that goal, it is considered to be a subtask. In their simple model, they award 1, 2, or 3 points to the different tasks and subtasks, depending on its above classification. Summing all tasks and subtasks point values down through all levels of nesting allows any task to be given a score that roughly ranks relative complexity of actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carl Anderson, Nigel R. Franks &amp; Daniel W. McShea |year=2001 |title=The complexity and hierarchical structure of tasks in insect societies |journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=643–651 |doi=10.1006/anbe.2001.1795}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also the review of task partitioning by Ratnieks and Anderson.&lt;ref name="Ratnieks"/&gt;

==Note: model-building==
All models are simplified abstractions of the real-life situation. There exists a basic tradeoff between model precision and parameter precision. A fixed amount of information collected, will, if split amongst the many parameters of an overly precise model, result in at least some of the parameters being represented by inadequate sample sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stephen P. Ellner  |author2=John Guckenheimer  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006 |title=Dynamic Models in Biology |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |pages=289–290 |isbn=978-0-691-12589-3 |chapter=Building dynamic models}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the often limited quantities and limited precision of data from which to calculate parameters values in non-human behavior studies, such models should generally be kept simple. Therefore, we generally should not expect models for social insect task allocation or task partitioning to be as elaborate as human [[workflow]] ones, for example.

==Metrics for division of labor==
With increased data, more elaborate metrics for division of labor within the colony become possible. Gorelick and Bertram survey the applicability of metrics taken from a wide range of other fields. They argue that a single output statistic is desirable, to permit comparisons across different population sizes and different numbers of tasks. But they also argue that the input to the function should be a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] representation (of time spent by each individual on each task), in order to provide the function with better data. They conclude that "... normalized matrix-input generalizations of [[Shannon index|Shannon's]] and [[Simpson index|Simpson's index]] ... should be the indices of choice when one wants to simultaneously examine division of labor amongst all individuals in a population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R.

Note that these indexes, used as metrics of [[biodiversity]], now find a place measuring division of labor.

The '''Teacher in Space Project''' ('''TISP''') was a [[NASA]] program announced by [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984 designed to inspire students, honor teachers, and spur interest in mathematics, science, and space exploration. The project would carry teachers into space as [[Payload Specialist]]s (non-astronaut civilians), who would return to their classrooms to share the experience with their students. 

NASA cancelled the program in 1990, following the death of its first participant, [[Christa McAuliffe]], in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] ([[STS-51-L]]) on January 28, 1986. NASA replaced Teachers in Space in 1998 with the [[Educator Astronaut Project]], which required its participants to become astronaut [[Mission Specialist|Mission Specialists]]. The first Educator Astronauts were selected as part of NASA Astronaut Group 19 in 2004. 

[[Barbara Morgan]], who was selected as a Mission Specialist as part of [[NASA Astronaut Group 17]] in 1998, has often been incorrectly referred to as an Educator Astronaut. However, she was selected as a Mission Specialist before the Educator Astronaut Project.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Griffin, NASA TV: STS-118 Post-Landing briefing&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASA programs==
TISP was announced by President [[Ronald Reagan]] on August 27, 1984. Not members of [[NASA Astronaut Corps|NASA's Astronaut Corps]], the teachers would fly as [[Payload Specialist]]s and return to their classrooms after flight. More than 40,000 applications were mailed to interested teachers while 11,000 teachers sent completed applications to NASA.  Each application included a potential lesson that would be taught from space while on the Space Shuttle.  The applications were sorted and then sent to the various State Departments of Education, who were then responsible for narrowing down their state applicants to a final set of two each.  These applicants were notified of their selections and were gathered together for further selection processes down to ten finalists.  These were then trained for a time, and in 1985 NASA selected [[Christa McAuliffe]] to be the first teacher in space, with [[Barbara Morgan]] as her backup. McAuliffe was a high school social studies teacher from Concord, New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronaut bio S.

McAuliffe died in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] ([[STS-51-L]]) on January 28, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Mission 51-L "Teacher In Space"|url=http://www.challenger.org/about-us/mission-51-l/|publisher=challenger.org|accessdate=3 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104173819/http://www.challenger.org/about-us/mission-51-l/|archivedate=4 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twenty-Five Years Later, McAuliffe’s Legacy Endures|url=http://neatoday.org/2011/01/28/twenty-five-years-later-mcauliffe%E2%80%99s-legacy-endures/|publisher=National Education Association|accessdate=3 November 2013|author=Kevin Hart|date=28 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917133555/http://neatoday.org/2011/01/28/twenty-five-years-later-mcauliffe%E2%80%99s-legacy-endures/|archivedate=17 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the accident, Reagan spoke on national television and assured the nation that the Teacher in Space program would continue. "We'll continue our quest in space", he said. "There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ronald | last=Reagan | title=Address to the nation on the Challenger disaster | date=1986-01-28 | publisher=Office of the President | url =http://www.reaganlibrary.com/reagan/speeches/challenger.asp | accessdate = 2007-08-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225128/http://www.reaganlibrary.com/reagan/speeches/challenger.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, NASA decided in 1990 that spaceflight was still too dangerous to risk the lives of civilian teachers, and eliminated the Teacher in Space project. Morgan returned to teaching in Idaho and later became a Mission Specialist on [[STS-118]].

===Educator Astronaut Project===
{{Main|Educator Astronaut Project}}

[[File:Morgan giving lecture.png|thumb|Barbara Morgan, Mission Specialist and backup for the Teacher in Space Project, speaks to an audience of students and media during a January 2007 demonstration at Space Center Houston.]]
In January 1998, NASA replaced the Teacher In Space project with the Educator Astronaut Project. Instead of training teachers for five months as [[Payload Specialist]]s who would return to the classroom, the Educator Astronaut program required selectees to give up their teaching careers, move to Houston, and become [[Mission Specialist]]s (full-time NASA astronauts).

The first Educator Astronauts were selected in 2004.  The three selected in 2004 were Joseph Acaba, Richard Arnold, and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger. Astronauts Acaba and Arnold flew on mission STS-119 in 2009, and Metcalf-Lindenburger flew aboard mission STS-131 in 2010. 

Although many sources incorrectly refer to Barbara Morgan as the first Educator Astronaut, in actuality, Morgan was selected as a Mission Specialist six years before the Educator Astronaut Project was put into place.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Griffin, NASA TV: STS-118 Post-Landing briefing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private program==
In the early 21st Century, the Teacher in Space project was revived in the private sector. The development of reusable, suborbital launch vehicles by commercial companies makes it possible for nonprofit groups to contemplate sending large numbers of teachers into space. The new Teachers in Space program began in 2005. In March 2005, Teacher in Space candidate Pam Leestma, a second-grade teacher and cousin of Space Shuttle astronaut [[David Leestma]], completed a training flight aboard a [[MiG-21]] operated by X-Rocket, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Edward | last=Wright | coauthors= | title=Teacher In Space Candidate Completes Proficiency Flight | date=2005-03-31 | publisher=X-rocket | url =http://www.ereleases.com/pr/20050331005.html | accessdate = 2007-08-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020013531/http://www.ereleases.com/pr/20050331005.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Armadillo Aerospace]], [[Masten Space Systems]], [[PlanetSpace]], [[Rocketplane Limited, Inc.]], and [[XCOR Aerospace]] pledged flights to the new Teachers in Space project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=Tumlinson | coauthors= | title=Masten Space Systems Donates Rocket Ride to Teacher | date=2006-10-16 | publisher=Space Frontier Foundation | url =http://www.space-frontier.org/PressReleases/2006/20060918TISMasten.html | accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advisors to the new Teachers in Space project include [[SpaceShipOne]] builder and Ansari X-Prize winner [[Burt Rutan]], X-Prize founder [[Peter Diamandis]], Apollo astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]], and private astronaut and X-Prize sponsor [[Anousheh Ansari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=Tumlinson |title= New Teachers In Space Program Gains Momentum | date=2006-04-21 | publisher=Space Frontier Foundation | url =http://www.space-frontier.org/PressReleases/2006/20060421teachersinspace.html |accessdate = 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Rocket Academy partnered with the SFF in 2006, and worked to draft rules for a "pathfinder" competition to select the first Teachers in Space. The rules were announced at the [[Wirefly X PRIZE Cup]] Competition held at Holloman Air Force Base near Alamogordo, New Mexico in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=Tumlinson | coauthors= | title=Godspeed Barbara Morgan; Plans for Large Numbers of Teachers in Space | date=2007-08-08 | publisher=Space Frontier Foundation | url =http://www.space-frontier.org/PressReleases/2007/20070808barbaramorgan.html | accessdate = 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications were accepted until November 4, 2008.

On June 11, 2013, [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]]’s new Commercial Space Operations degree program, the first of its kind in the world, announced they will sponsor the Teachers in Space summer workshops for the next five years, indicating their intent toward a continuing long term relationship as well as their sharing a vision to "...help students, teachers and organizers collaborate in bringing space education to every level, from K-12 to graduate programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University |title=Embry-Riddle’s New Degree Program in Commercial Space Operations to Sponsor Teachers in Space Summer Workshops |url=http://daytonabeach.erau.edu/news/teachers-in-space.html |date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Education |date=August 1, 2012 |title=Weekly Update: NASA Education |url=https://education.jsc.nasa.gov/war/archive/war_roll_up.cfm?&amp;date=20120801&amp;type=month&amp;yr=2012 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Program director Elizabeth Kennick incorporated the Teachers in Space project as an educational nonprofit in New York, spinning it off from the Space Frontier Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacefrontier.org/2014/10/12921/ |title=Space Frontier Foundation Launches Teachers in Space, Inc. &amp;#124; Space Frontier Foundation |website=Spacefrontier.org |date=2014-10-23 |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  5 original Pathfinders (James Kuhl, Rachael Manzer, Lanette Oliver, Chantelle Rose, and Michael Schmidt) remain with the program, also Vice President Joe Latrell and several teacher volunteers.  [[Teachers in Space, Inc.]] has now flown two teacher/student designed experiments to International Space Station (ISS), launched and retrieved several high altitude balloons with data sensors, put teachers through astronaut training experiences including hypobaric chamber and centrifuge, and delivered weeklong professional development workshops for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) teachers in California, Florida, Oklahoma, Texas, and Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Space Show |title=Elizabeth (Liz) Kennick, Teachers In Space, Friday, 2-21-14 |url=http://thespaceshow.wordpress.com/tag/teachers-in-space/ |date=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Teachers in Space, Inc. |title=May Teachers in Space Newsletter |url=http://teachers-in-space.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAYTeachersinSpaceNewsletter.pdf |date=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For2|information on the description of the [[Medieval Warm Period]] and [[Little Ice Age]] in various IPCC reports|[[MWP and LIA in IPCC reports]]}}

The '''temperature record of the past 1,000 years''' or longer is reconstructed using data from [[Proxy (climate)|climate proxy]] records in conjunction with the modern [[instrumental temperature record]] which only covers the last 150 years at a global scale. Large-scale reconstructions covering part or all of the [[1st millennium]] and [[2nd millennium]] have shown that recent temperatures are exceptional: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] of 2007 concluded that "Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were ''very likely'' higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and ''likely'' the highest in at least the past 1,300 years." The curve shown in graphs of these reconstructions is widely known as the [[hockey stick graph]] because of the sharp increase in temperatures during the last century. As of 2010 this broad pattern was supported by [[List of large scale temperature reconstructions of the last 2,000 years|more than two dozen reconstructions]], using various statistical methods and combinations of proxy records, with variations in how flat the pre-20th-century "shaft" appears. Sparseness of proxy records results in considerable uncertainty for earlier periods.&lt;ref name="Frank 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Esper|Zorita|Wilson|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2000 Year Temperature Comparison.png|thumb|The temperature record of the past 2000 years from several different proxy methods]]

Individual proxy records, such as tree ring widths and densities used in [[dendroclimatology]], are calibrated against the instrumental record for the period of overlap. Networks of such records are used to reconstruct past temperatures for regions: tree ring proxies have been used to reconstruct [[Northern Hemisphere]] extratropical temperatures (within the tropics trees do not form rings) but are confined to land areas and are scarce in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] which is largely ocean. Wider coverage is provided by multiproxy reconstructions, incorporating proxies such as lake sediments, ice cores and corals which are found in different regions, and using statistical methods to relate these sparser proxies to the greater numbers of tree ring records. The "Composite Plus Scaling" (CPS) method is widely used for large-scale multiproxy reconstructions of hemispheric or global average temperatures; this is complemented by Climate Field Reconstruction (CFR) methods which show how climate patterns have developed over large spatial areas, making the reconstruction useful for investigating natural variability and long-term oscillations as well as for comparisons with patterns produced by climate models.

During the 1,900 years before the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, it is likely that the next warmest period was from 950 to 1100, with peaks at different times in different regions. This has been called the [[Medieval Warm Period]], and some evidence suggests widespread cooler conditions during a period around the 17th century known as the [[Little Ice Age]]. In the [[hockey stick controversy]], contrarians have asserted that the Medieval Warm Period was warmer than at present, and have disputed the data and methods of climate reconstructions.

== General techniques and accuracy ==

By far the best observed period is from 1850 to the present day, with coverage improving over time. Over this period the [[Instrumental temperature record|recent instrumental record]], mainly based on direct [[thermometer]] readings, has approximately global coverage. It shows a general warming in global temperatures.

Before this time various proxies must be used. These proxies are less accurate than direct thermometer measurements, have lower temporal resolution, and have less spatial coverage. Their only advantage is that they enable a longer record to be reconstructed. Since the direct temperature record is more accurate than the proxies (indeed, it is needed to calibrate them) it is used when available: i.e., from 1850 onwards.

===Quantitative methods using proxy data===
{{Main article| Proxy (climate)}}

As there are few instrumental records before 1850, temperatures before then must be reconstructed based on [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] methods.  One such method, based on principles of [[dendroclimatology]], uses the width and other characteristics of tree rings to infer temperature. The [[isotope|isotopic]] composition of snow, corals, and [[stalactites]] can also be used to infer temperature.  Other techniques which have been used include examining records of the time of crop harvests, the treeline in various locations, and other historical records to make inferences about the temperature. These proxy reconstructions are indirect inferences of temperature and thus tend to have greater uncertainty than instrumental data.

Most proxy records have to be calibrated against local temperature records during their period of overlap, to estimate the relationship between temperature and the proxy. The longer history of the proxy is then used to reconstruct temperature from earlier periods.

Proxy records must be averaged in some fashion if a global or hemispheric record is desired. The "Composite Plus Scaling" (CPS) method is widely used for large-scale multiproxy reconstructions of hemispheric or global average temperatures. This is complemented by Climate Field Reconstruction (CFR) methods which show how climate patterns have developed over large spatial areas.

Considerable care must be taken in the averaging process; for example, if a certain region has a large number of tree ring records, a simple average of all the data would strongly over-weight that region, and statistical techniques are used to avoid such over-weighting. In the {{harvnb|Mann|Bradley|Hughes|1998}} and {{harvnb|Mann|Bradley|Hughes|1999}} CFR reconstructions, [[principal components analysis]] was used to combine some of these regional records before they were globally combined.  An important distinction is between so-called 'multi-proxy' reconstructions, which attempt to obtain a global temperature reconstruction by using multiple proxy records distributed over the globe and more regional reconstructions. Usually, the various proxy records are combined arithmetically, in some weighted average. More recently, Osborn and Briffa used a simpler technique, counting the proportion of records that are positive, negative or neutral in any time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Osborn|Briffa|2006}};

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produces a result in general agreement with
the conventional multi-proxy studies.

The 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] cited 14 reconstructions, 10 of which covered 1,000 years or longer, to support its conclusion that "Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were very likely higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and likely the highest in at least the past 1,300 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC|2007}}, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-a-palaeoclimatic.html A: Palaeoclimatic Perspective]; see also {{Harvnb|Jansen et al.|2007}}, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch6s6-6.html Sec. 6.6.1.1 What Do Reconstructions Based on Palaeoclimatic Proxies Show?].
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualitative reconstruction using historical records===

It is also possible to use historical data such as times of grape harvests, sea-ice-free periods in harbours and diary entries of frost or heatwaves to produce indications of when it was warm or cold in particular regions. These records are harder to calibrate, are often only available sparsely through time, may be available only from developed regions, and are unlikely to come with good error estimates. These historical observations of the same time period show periods of both warming and cooling.

===Limitations ===

The apparent differences between the quantitative and qualitative approaches are not fully reconciled. The reconstructions mentioned above rely on various assumptions to generate their results. If these assumptions do not hold, the reconstructions would be unreliable. For quantitative reconstructions, the most fundamental assumptions are that proxy records vary with temperature and that non-temperature factors do not confound the results. In the historical records temperature fluctuations may be regional rather than hemispheric in scale.

In a letter to '''Nature''' {{Harvtxt|Bradley|Hughes|Mann|2006}} pointed at the original title of their 1998 article: ''Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the past millennium: inferences, uncertainties, and limitations''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|Bradley|Hughes|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and pointed out more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached and that the uncertainties were the point of the article.

==Development and controversy==
{{main article|Hockey stick graph|Hockey stick controversy}}

In the 1960s, [[Hubert Lamb]] generalised from [[historical climatology|historical documents]] and temperature records of central England to propose that the North Atlantic region had seen a [[Medieval Warm Period]] from around 900 to 1300, followed by [[Little Ice Age]]. This was the basis of a "schematic diagram" featured in the [[IPCC First Assessment Report]] beside cautions that the medieval warming might not have been global. The use of [[Proxy (climate)|proxy]] indicators to get quantitative estimates of the [[temperature record]] of past centuries developed sporadically from the 1930s onwards, and {{harvnb|Bradley|Jones|1993}} introduced the "Composite Plus Scaling" (CPS) method used by most later large-scale reconstructions.&lt;ref name="Fingerprints (1990s-2000s)"&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2011c|loc=[http://www.aip.org/history/climate/20ctrend.htm#S5 Fingerprints (1990s-2000s)]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Briffa|Osborn|Lough|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their study was featured in the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report]], which included its graph of decadal average hemispheric temperatures back to 1400. There was increasing political dispute over the implications of the science, and over proposed ratification of the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]].

In 1998 [[Michael E. Mann]], [[Raymond S. Bradley]] and [[Malcolm K. Hughes]] developed new statistical techniques to produce {{harvnb|Mann|Bradley|Hughes|1998}} (MBH98), the first [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]]-based climate field reconstruction (CFR). This showed global patterns of annual surface temperature, and included a graph of average hemispheric temperatures back to 1400 with shading emphasising that uncertainties (to two [[standard error]] limits) were much greater in earlier centuries.&lt;ref name="Wahl 2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Wahl|Ammann|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was disputed by the fossil fuel funded [[George C. Marshall Institute]] and [[Willie Soon]] and [[Sallie Baliunas]], who said that the reconstruction only went back to 1400 to avoid showing the Medieval Warm Period.

{{harvnb|Jones|Briffa|Barnett|Tett|1998}} independently produced a CPS reconstruction extending back for a thousand years, and {{harvnb|Mann|Bradley|Hughes|1999}} (MBH99) used the MBH98 methodology to extend their study back to 1000.&lt;ref name="Weart HS"&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2011c|loc=[http://www.aip.org/history/climate/20ctrend.htm#S6 The Hockey Stick and Beyond]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TAR 2.3.2.2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Folland et al.|2001}}, [http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/069.htm#fig220 2.3.2.2 Multi-proxy synthesis of recent temperature change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604072514/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2Fclimate%2Fipcc_tar%2Fwg1%2F069.htm |date=2011-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''''hockey stick''''' was coined by the climatologist [[Jerry Mahlman]], to describe the pattern this showed, envisaging a graph that is relatively flat to 1900 as forming an [[Ice hockey stick]]'s "shaft", followed by a sharp increase corresponding to the "blade".&lt;ref name="Monastersky"&gt;{{cite news |title=Climate Science on Trial |author=Richard Monastersky |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Climate-Science-on-Trial/34665 |newspaper=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=September 5, 2003 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Harvnb|BBC News, 16 July|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the MBH99 graph was featured prominently in the 2001 [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] (TAR), which also drew on Jones et al. 1998 and three other reconstructions to support the conclusion that, in the Northern Hemisphere, the 1990s was likely to have been the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year during the past 1,000 years. The graph was featured in publicity, and became a focus of dispute for those opposed to the strengthening [[scientific consensus]] that late 20th century warmth was exceptional.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/09/hockey-stick-graph-ipcc-report "Part three: Hockey stick graph took pride of place in IPCC report, despite doubts"].&lt;/ref&gt; When the IPCC TAR was still in draft, [[Fred Singer]] held a press event saying "We don't accept this" with  [[Wibjörn Karlén]] who alleged that MBH99 showed neither a Medieval Warm Period nor a Little Ice Age, an inaccurate claim echoed soon afterwards by [[John Lawrence Daly]].

In 2003, as lobbying over the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]] intensified, Soon and Baliunas published a paper claiming greater medieval warmth, and on this basis the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] chief of staff [[Philip Cooney]] deleted references to climate reconstructions from the first [[Environmental Protection Agency]] ''Report on the Environment''. The paper was quickly dismissed by scientists in the [[Soon and Baliunas controversy]], but on July 28, Republican [[Jim Inhofe]] spoke in the Senate speech citing Soon and Baliunas to claim "that man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people".&lt;ref name="revkin August 5, 2003"&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2003, [[Stephen McIntyre]] and [[Ross McKitrick]] published  {{harvnb|McIntyre|McKitrick|2003}} disputing the data used in MBH98 paper. They were given extensive publicity, and met Inhofe as well as making a presentation sponsored by the [[George C. Marshall Institute]] and the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]]. In 2004 [[Hans von Storch]] published criticism of the statistical techniques as tending to underplay variations in earlier parts of the graph, though this was disputed and he later accepted that the effect was very small.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/climatefeedback/2007/05/the_decay_of_the_hockey_stick.html The Decay of the Hockey Stick], Nature "Climate Feedback" blog post by von Storch. "...we do not think that McIntyre has substantially contributed in the published peer-reviewed literature to the debate about the statistical merits of the MBH and related method." (comment by von Storch &amp; Zorita, May 7, 2007 07:35 PM, in response to multiple comments on their failure to acknowledge McIntyre and McKitrick's contributions)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 McIntyre and McKitrick published criticisms of the [[principal components analysis]] methodology as used in MBH98 and MBH99. Their analysis was subsequently disputed by published papers including {{harvnb|Huybers|2005}} and {{harvnb|Wahl|Ammann|2007}} which pointed to errors in the McIntyre and McKitrick methodology. In June 2005 Rep. [[Joe Barton]] launched what [[Sherwood Boehlert]], chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|House Science Committee]], called a "misguided and illegitimate investigation" into the data, methods and personal information of Mann, Bradley and Hughes. At Boehlert's request a panel of scientists convened by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] was set up, which reported in 2006 supporting Mann's findings with some qualifications, including agreeing that there were some statistical failings but these had little effect on the result.&lt;ref name="Part four guardian"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearce|2010_pt4}}&lt;!-- Pt. 4 --&gt;, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/09/hockey-stick-michael-mann-steve-mcintyre "Part four: Climate change debate overheated after sceptics grasped 'hockey stick'"].&lt;/ref&gt; Barton and [[Ed Whitfield|U.S. Rep. Ed Whitfield]] requested [[Edward Wegman]] to set up a team of statisticians to investigate. The [[Wegman Report]] supported McIntyre and McKitrick's view that there were statistical failings, but did not quantify whether there was any significant effect. It included an extensive network analysis which has been discredited by expert opinion and found to have issues of plagiarism. Arguments against the MBH studies were reintroduced as part of the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]], but dismissed by eight independent investigations.

The test in science is whether findings can be replicated using different data and methods. [[List of large scale temperature reconstructions of the last 2,000 years|More than two dozen reconstructions]], using various statistical methods and combinations of proxy records, have supported the broad consensus shown in the original 1998 hockey-stick graph, with variations in how flat the pre-20th century "shaft" appears.&lt;ref name="Frank 2010"/&gt; The 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] cited 14 reconstructions, 10 of which covered 1,000 years or longer, to support its strengthened conclusion that it was likely that Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the 20th century were the highest in at least the past 1,300 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jansen et al.|2007}}, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch6s6-6.html Section 6.6: The Last 2,000 Years].&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddell's correllations have not been generally accepted or well regarded, in part due to his use of the word [[Aryan]]. Conventional lists separate [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] from [[Menes]] by around five hundred years. Commenting on this and other works, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says "These works, containing much painstaking research and impressive to many, did not win the approval of experts."&lt;ref name="ArchBulletin"&gt;[http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 Moshenka, Gabriel., 'At Variance With Both General and Expert Opinion': The Later Works of Lieutenant-Colonel Professor Laurence Austine Waddell, Bulletin of the History of Archaeology, UCL Institute of Archaeology, 2010.] ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjV5HK0i?url=http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 |date=October 27, 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddell's primary chronology was compiled from various [[Sumerian king list]]s, Egyptian [[list of pharaohs]], the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Rigveda]] and numerous [[Indus Valley Civilization]] seals and other monuments and relics and sources, some of which he had deciphered himself.&lt;ref name="Preston2009"/&gt; It was entitled "Dated Chronological List of [[Sumer]]ian or Early [[Aryan]] Kings from the Rise of Civilization to the [[Kassites|Kassi Dynasty]]" and documented an alleged list of [[Sacred king|world emperor]]s as follows:

The '''''Westmorland''''' or '''''Westmoreland'''''&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes referred to as [[His Majesty's Ship|HMS]] Westmoreland/Westmorland.  However, according to ''[[Ships of the Royal Navy]]'', like most other privateers she was never actually [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a 26-gun British [[privateer]] [[frigate]], operating in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] against French shipping in retaliation for France's opposition to Great Britain in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

==Service history==

The most notable incident in the life of the ''Westmorland'' occurred shortly after she sailed for Britain from [[Livorno]] under Captain Michael Wallace late in 1778, carrying a large monetary payment for her inbound cargo of salt cod from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (Livorno was a trade hub for this commodity), food goods,&lt;ref&gt;These included almost 4000 barrels of anchovies, 129 pounds of silk, 150 crates of manna and oil, thirty-four bales of hemp, thirty-two Parmesan cheeses, twenty-two barrels of Tartar salt and medicines and five crates of artificial flowers.&lt;/ref&gt; and 57 crates of artistic objects collected by [[Grand Tour]]ists such as the [[Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Duke of Gloucester]], [[Sir John Henderson, 5th Baronet|Sir John Henderson]] and the [[Charles Howard, 10th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]].&lt;ref&gt;Including Batoni's portrait of Charles Cecil Roberts and a second portrait called An English Gentleman; sculptures by [[Albacini]] and [[Christopher Hewetson]]; a marble chimney originally destined for the Duke of Gloucester; musical scores, violins, violin strings, hats (two barrels), ornamental fans, expensive books; [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] sketches; specimens of lava from [[Mount Vesuvius]] sent by [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|William Hamilton]]; relics; paintings by [[Pompeo Batoni]], [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], [[Carlo Maratta]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Guercino]], among others; modern copies of [[Raphael]]'s paintings; drawings by artists working in Rome, including [[John Robert Cozens]]; 23 crates of ancient Roman marble statues and fragments, plus modern plaster casts; other carved marble mantelpieces, slabs of coloured marble for table-tops, full-sized Piranesi-like "vasi candelabri", 84 rolls of deluxe blank Genoa paper, a crate of flowering onion bulbs and seeds; boxes of pomade, sweetmeats and citrus-blossom water, four barrels of Madeira, and a double-barreled rifle.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1779,&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez-Jáuregui and Wilcox. ''The English Prize: The Capture of the Westmorland, An Episode of the Grand Tour.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; she was given chase by four French ships, comprising two men-of-war, the [[French ship Caton (1778)|''Caton'']] (64) and the [[French ship Destin (1778)|''Destin'']] (74), and two smaller vessels.  Wallace attempted to outsail them but, outgunned as he was, soon felt he had little option but to allow the French to board his ship. She was then allowed by Spain (then friendly with France though not yet&amp;nbsp;— in formal terms at least&amp;nbsp;— at war with Britain) to continue to [[Málaga]].

[[File:Mengs, Perseus befreit Andromeda.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Perseus And Andromeda'' by Mengs, another painting captured from the ''Westmorland'' ([[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]])]]
At Málaga her artistic contents were passed on from the French government to two trading companies with links to Ireland, despite Wallace's protests that the ship was full of "extremely precious goods" (the French had already seized her cash cargo), and the Spanish king was informed by his prime minister, the [[Count of Floridablanca]], of the arrival of the art works. Upon Spain's formal declaration of war, king [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] secretly bought the art from a syndicate of Madrid merchants for 360,000 silver [[Spanish real|reales]] (a discount on their original asking price of 600,000 gold [[doubloon]]s, but still a considerable sum) and had it brought by cart to the capital. The portraits of Basset and [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Lord Lewisham]], meanwhile, were acquired by the Spanish Prime Minister.

Although the British consul at [[Cadiz]] had initially informed the [[British Admiralty]] that the ''Westmorland'' and her cargo had been seized as legitimate [[prize ship|prizes]], demands followed from the British ambassador, firmly backed at cabinet level, for the repatriation of the art and (in a prisoner exchange for French and Spanish prisoners taken by the [[Royal Navy]]) the crew of the ''Westmorland''. Yet to this day, all these coveted artistic treasures remain the possession of the [[Prado Museum]], the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|Real Academia]], and other Spanish national collections. There were only a few, very limited exceptions: a package of Catholic relics intended for the Duke of Norfolk (which the Spanish returned unopened to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]); and Sir Watkin Williams Wynn's ''Perseus and Andromeda'' by [[Anton Raphael Mengs|Mengs]], which ended up in the collection of [[Catherine the Great]] at the [[Hermitage Museum]].

In 1784, the £100,000 for which the art had been insured at Livorno were paid out in London.  The ''Westmorland'', for its part, was renamed, re-commissioned into the Spanish fleet, but eventually re-taken in the [[Caribbean]] by the British.

In 2012 an exhibition of many of the art works captured was held at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at [[Oxford University]] and then traveled to the [[Yale Center for British Art]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|title=Revealed: Grand Tour loot of the Presa Inglesa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/nov/20/grand-tour-loot-presa-inglesa|accessdate=21 November 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vickery|first=Amanda|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/may/04/cargo-culture-grand-tour-unpacked |title=The captured cargo that unpacks the spirit of the grand tour|accessdate=4 August 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez-Jáuregui and Wilcox.

'''Xeon Phi'''&lt;ref name=IntelXeonPhiName /&gt; is a series of [[x86]] [[Manycore processor|manycore processors]] designed and made entirely by [[Intel]]. They are intended for use in supercomputers, servers, and high-end workstations. Its architecture allows use of standard programming languages and APIs such as [[OpenMP]].&lt;ref&gt;https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/best-known-methods-for-using-openmp-on-intel-many-integrated-core-intel-mic-architecture&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it was originally based on an earlier GPU design by Intel, it shares application areas with GPUs.{{cn|date=October 2017}} The main difference between Xeon Phi and a [[GPGPU]] like [[Nvidia Tesla]] is that Xeon Phi, with an x86-compatible core, can, with less modification, run software that was originally targeted at a standard x86 CPU.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Initially in the form of [[PCIe]]-based add-on cards, a second generation product, codenamed ''Knights Landing'' was announced in June 2013. These second generation chips could be used as a standalone CPU, rather than just as an add-in card.

[[File:Tianhe-2.jpg|thumb|The [[Tianhe-2]] supercomputer uses Xeon Phi processors.]]

===Background===
The [[Larrabee (microarchitecture)|Larrabee microarchitecture]] (in development since 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1029138/new-from-intel-its-mini-cores |title= New from Intel: It's Mini-Cores! |author= Charlie Demerjian |date= July 3, 2006 |work= www.theinquirer.net |publisher= [[The Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) introduced very wide (512-bit) [[SIMD]] units to a [[x86]] architecture based processor design, extended to a [[Cache coherence|cache-coherent]] multiprocessor system connected via a ring bus to memory; each core was capable of four-way multithreading. Due to the design being intended for GPU as well as general purpose computing, the Larrabee chips also included specialised hardware for texture sampling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Cavin|first2=D.|last3=Espasa|first3=E.|last4=Grochowski|first4=T.|last5=Juan|first5=M.|last6=Hanrahan|first6=P.|last7=Carmean|first7=S.|last8=Sprangle|first8=A.|last9=Forsyth|first9=J.|date=August 2008|title=Larrabee: A Many-Core x86 Architecture for Visual Computing|url=https://download-software.intel.com/sites/default/files/m/9/4/9/larrabee_manycore.pdf|format=PDF|journal=[[ACM Transactions on Graphics]]|series=Proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH 2008|volume=27|issue=3|pages=18:11–18:11|doi=10.1145/1360612.1360617|issn=0730-0301|first1=L.|last1=Seiler|first10=R.|last10=Abrash|first11=R.|last11=Dubey|first12=E.|last12=Junkins|first13=T.|last13=Lake|first14=P.|last14=Sugerman|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Another contemporary Intel research project implementing x86 architecture on a many-multicore processor was the '[[Single-chip Cloud Computer]]' (prototype introduced 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/183653/intel_48core_singlechip_cloud_computer_improves_power_efficiency.html |title= Intel 48-Core "Single-Chip Cloud Computer" Improves Power Efficiency |author= Tony Bradley |publisher= [[PC World (magazine)|PCWorld]] |work= www.pcworld.com |date= December 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a design mimicking a [[cloud computing]] computer datacentre on a single chip with multiple independent cores: the prototype design included 48 cores per chip with hardware support for selective frequency and voltage control of cores to maximize energy efficiency, and incorporated a [[Mesh networking|mesh network]] for inter-chip messaging. The design lacked cache-coherent cores and focused on principles that would allow the design to scale to many more cores.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://techresearch.intel.com/ProjectDetails.aspx?Id=1 |title= Intel Research : Single-Chip Cloud Computer |publisher= [[Intel]] |work= techresearch.intel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, [[ScaleMP]] announced a virtualization update allowing Xeon Phi as a transparent processor extension, allowing legacy [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]]/[[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] code to run without code changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.scalemp.com/scalemp-vsmp-foundation-to-support-intel-xeon-phi |title= ScaleMP vSMP Foundation to Support Intel Xeon Phi |work= www.ScaleMP.com |publisher= [[ScaleMP]] |date= June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important component of the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor’s core is its vector processing unit (VPU).&lt;ref&gt;https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-xeon-phi-coprocessor-codename-knights-corner&lt;/ref&gt;
The VPU features a novel 512-bit SIMD instruction set, officially known as Intel Initial Many Core Instructions (Intel IMCI). Thus, the VPU can execute 16 [[Single-precision floating-point format|single-precision]] (SP) or 8 [[Double-precision floating-point format|double-precision]] (DP) operations per cycle. The VPU also supports Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) instructions and hence can execute 32 SP or 16 DP floating point operations per cycle. It also provides support for integers.
The VPU also features an Extended Math Unit (EMU) that can execute operations such as reciprocal, square root, and logarithm, thereby allowing these operations to be executed in a vector fashion with high bandwidth. The EMU operates by calculating polynomial approximations of these functions.

On November 12, 2012, Intel announced two Xeon Phi coprocessor families using the 22&amp;nbsp;nm process size: the Xeon Phi 3100 and the Xeon Phi 5110P.&lt;ref name="IntelXeonPhiProducts2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2012/11/12/intel-delivers-new-architecture-for-discovery-with-intel-xeon-phi-coprocessors|title=Intel Delivers New Architecture for Discovery with Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessors|date=November 12, 2012|publisher=Intel|author=IntelPR|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ComputerworldXeonPhiProducts2012&gt;{{cite news |title=Intel ships 60-core Xeon Phi processor |author=Agam Shah |publisher=Computerworld |url=https://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9233498/Intel_ships_60_core_Xeon_Phi_processor |date=November 12, 2012 |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AnandtechXeonPhiProducts2012&gt;{{cite news |title=The Xeon Phi at work at TACC |author=Johan De Gelas |publisher=AnandTech |url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/6451/the-xeon-phi-at-work-at-tacc |date=November 14, 2012 |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xeon Phi 3100 will be capable of more than 1&amp;nbsp;teraFLOPS of double precision floating point instructions with 240&amp;nbsp;GB/sec memory bandwidth at 300&amp;nbsp;W.&lt;ref name=IntelXeonPhiProducts2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ComputerworldXeonPhiProducts2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=AnandtechXeonPhiProducts2012/&gt; The Xeon Phi 5110P will be capable of 1.01&amp;nbsp;teraFLOPS of double precision floating point instructions with 320&amp;nbsp;GB/sec memory bandwidth at 225&amp;nbsp;W.&lt;ref name=IntelXeonPhiProducts2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ComputerworldXeonPhiProducts2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=AnandtechXeonPhiProducts2012/&gt; The Xeon Phi 7120P will be capable of 1.2&amp;nbsp;teraFLOPS of double precision floating point instructions with 352&amp;nbsp;GB/sec memory bandwidth at 300&amp;nbsp;W.

Code name for the second generation MIC architecture product from Intel.&lt;ref name="stampedeieee"/&gt; Intel officially first revealed details of its second generation Intel Xeon Phi products on June 17, 2013.&lt;ref name="knightslandingjune2013"/&gt; Intel said that the next generation of Intel MIC Architecture-based products will be available in two forms, as a coprocessor or a host processor (CPU), and be manufactured using Intel's [[14 nanometer|14&amp;nbsp;nm]] process technology. Knights Landing products will include integrated on-package memory for significantly higher memory bandwidth.

Knights Landing contains up to 72 [[Airmont (microarchitecture)|Airmont]] (Atom) cores with four threads per core,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/intel-xeon-phi-knights-landing-features-integrated-memory-500-gbs-bandwidth-ddr4-memory-support-architecture-detailed/|title=Intel Xeon Phi 'Knights Landing' Features Integrated Memory With 500&amp;nbsp;GB/s Bandwidth and DDR4 Memory Support - Architecture Detailed|work=WCCFtech|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/171678-intel-unveils-72-core-x86-knights-landing-cpu-for-exascale-supercomputing |title=Intel unveils 72-core x86 Knights Landing CPU for exascale supercomputing |date=November 26, 2013 |author=Sebastian Anthony |publisher= [[ExtremeTech]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; using [[LGA 3647]] socket&lt;ref name="tomshardware_xeonphi"&gt;[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-xeon-phi-knights-landing,32121.html Tom's Hardware: Intel Xeon Phi Knights Landing Now Shipping; Omni Path Update, Too].

On November 14, 2016, the 48th list of [[TOP500]] contained 10 systems using Knights Landing platforms.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The [[PCIe]] based co-processor variant of Knight's Landing was never offered to the general market and was discontinued by August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Larabel|first1=Michael|title=Intel Quietly Drops Xeon Phi 7200 Coprocessors|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=No-More-Xeon-Phi-7200-Cards|accessdate=25 August 2017|publisher=Phoronix|date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the 7220A, 7240P and 7220P coprocessor cards.

Intel announced the product discontinuance during Summer 2018&lt;ref name="Knights Landing Product Discontinuance"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://qdms.intel.com/dm/i.aspx/9C54A9A7-BF37-4496-B268-BD2746EA54D3/PCN116378-00.pdf |title=Product Change Notification 116378 - 00 |accessdate=25 July 2018 |website= Intel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Models
All models can boost to their peak speeds, adding 200&amp;nbsp;MHz to their base frequency when running just one or two cores. When running from three to the maximum number of cores, the chips can only boost 100&amp;nbsp;MHz above the base frequency. All chips run high-AVX code at a frequency reduced by 200&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intel Xeon Phi processor: Your Path to Deeper Insight|url=https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/xeon-phi-processor-product-brief.pdf|website=Intel.com|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
