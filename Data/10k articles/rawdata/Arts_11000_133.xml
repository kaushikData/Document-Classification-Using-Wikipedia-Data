In the first decade of the 21st century, the rise of computers as the primary means to record, distribute, store, and play music caused widespread economic changes in the [[music industry]], fundamentally changing the relationships between artists, record companies, promoters, retail music stores, the technology industry, and consumers. The rise of digital music consumption options contributed to a few fundamental changes in consumption. First the decline of album sales. With the A la carte sales models increasing in popularity, consumers no longer download entire albums but rather choose single songs.

&lt;!-- TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES --&gt;
The initial stage (from approximately 1998 to 2001) of the [[digital music]] revolution was the emergence of [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) networks that allowed the free exchange of music files (such as [[Kazaa]] and [[Napster (peer-to-peer)|Napster]]). By 2001, the cost of [[hard drive]] space had dropped to a level that allowed pocket-sized computers to store large libraries of music. The [[iPod]] and [[iTunes]] system for music storage and playback became immensely popular, and many consumers began to transfer their physical recording media (such as [[CD]]s) onto computer hard drives. The [[iTunes Music Store]] offered legal downloads beginning in 2003, and competitors soon followed, offering a variety of online music services, such as [[internet radio]]. Digital music distribution was aided by the widespread acceptance of [[broadband]] in the middle of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.shellypalmermedia.com/2008/12/07/broadband-and-retail-black-friday-and-cyber-247365/|title = Broadband and Retail: Black Friday and Cyber-24/7/365|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = Palmer|first = Shelley|date = 7 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, recording software (such as [[Avid Technology|Avid]]'s [[Pro Tools]]) began to be used almost exclusively to make records, rendering expensive multitrack tape machines (such as the 1967 [[Studer]]) almost obsolete.

&lt;!-- DECLINE IN REVENUE --&gt;
The chief economic impact of these changes was a dramatic decline in revenues from recorded music. In the 21st century, consumers spent far less money on recorded music than they had in 1990s, in all formats. Total revenues for [[CD]]s, [[Gramophone record|vinyl]], [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] and [[music download|digital downloads]] in the U.S. dropped from a high of $14.6 billion in 1999 to $9 billion in 2008.

The popularity of [[Music download|internet music distribution]] has increased and by 2007 more units were sold over the internet than in any other form.&lt;ref name="NYT2008"&gt;{{cite news

However, as ''[[The Economist]]'' reported, "paid digital downloads grew rapidly, but did not begin to make up for the loss of revenue from CDs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The 2000s period stands in stark contrast from the "CD boom" of 1984-1995, when profit margins averaged above 30% and industry executives were notorious for their high profile, even frivolous spending.&lt;ref name=Knopper&gt;{{cite book| last=Knopper | first=Steve | year=2009 | title=Appetite for Self-Destruction: the Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry in the Digital Age | publisher=Free Press | ISBN=978-1-4165-5215-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- FAILURE IN THE INDUSTRY --&gt;
The major record labels consistently failed to heed warnings or to support any measures that embraced the change in technology.&lt;ref name=Knopper/&gt; In the early years of the decade, the industry fought illegal [[file sharing]], successfully shutting down [[Napster (peer-to-peer)|Napster]] in 2001 and threatening thousands of individuals with legal action. This failed to slow the decline in revenue and was a public relations disaster.&lt;ref name=Knopper/&gt; Some academic studies have even suggested that downloads were not the true cause of the decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--CHANGING RELATIONSHIPS ---&gt;
The turmoil in the industry changed the balance of power among all the various players. The major music-only stores such as [[Tower Records]] (which once wielded considerable influence in the industry) went bankrupt, replaced by [[box stores]] (such as [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Best Buy]]). Recording artists began to rely primarily on [[concert|live performance]]s and [[merchandise]] for their income, which in turn made them more dependent on [[music promoter]]s such as [[Live Nation]] (which dominates tour promotion and owns a large number of [[music venue]]s.)&lt;ref name="Live Nation"&gt;

| accessdate= 15 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to benefit from all of an artist's income streams, record companies began to rely on the "[[360 deal]]", a new business relationship pioneered by [[Robbie Williams]] and [[EMI]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the other extreme, record companies also used simple manufacturing and [[distribution deal]]s, which gives a higher percentage to the artist, but does not cover the expense of marketing and promotion. Many newer artists no longer see any kind of "[[record deal]]" as an integral part of their [[business plan]] at all. Inexpensive recording hardware and software made it possible to create high quality music in a bedroom and distribute it over the internet to a worldwide audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

This, in turn, caused problems for [[recording studio]]s, [[record producer]]s and [[audio engineer]]s: the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that, by 2009, as many as half of the recording facilities in that city had failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Consumers benefited enormously from the ease with which music can be shared from computer to computer, whether over the internet or by the exchange of physical CDs. This has given consumers unparalleled choice in music consumption and has opened up performers to [[niche market]]s to which they previously had little access.&lt;ref name=Kusek/&gt; According to a Nielsen and Billboard report, in 2012 digital music sales topped the physical sale of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/05/technology/digital_music_sales/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Digital music sales top physical sales | date=5 January 2012 | accessdate=24 April 2012 | first1=Laurie | last1=Segall|authorlink=Laurie Segall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peer-to-peer (P2P) downloading==
===Dawn of P2P: Napster===

[[Napster (peer-to-peer)|Napster]] was an online music [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|file sharing]] service created by [[Shawn Fanning]] while he was attending [[Northeastern University]] in [[Boston]] and operating between June 1999 and July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_33/b3694003.htm Napster's High and Low Notes] - ''Businessweek'' - 14 August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Its technology allowed people to easily copy and distribute [[MP3]] files among each other, bypassing the established market for such songs and thus leading to the music industry's accusations of massive [[copyright violation]]s.

The first peer-to-peer case was ''[[A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.]]'', 239&amp;nbsp;F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001). The court found that Napster was contributory liable for the [[copyright infringement]] of its end-users because it "knowingly encourages and assists the infringement of plaintiffs' copyrights."&lt;ref&gt;Napster, at 1020.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original service was shut down by court order, it paved the way for larger decentralized peer-to-peer file-distribution programs such as [[Kazaa]], [[Morpheus (computer program)|Morpheus]], [[Grokster]], [[iMesh]], and [[Limewire]], which have been much harder to control because they practice more technically and legally creative approaches.&lt;ref name = Kusek&gt;David Kusek and Gerd Leonhard. (2005). "The Future of Music: Manifesto for the Digital Music Revolution". Berklee Press: Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

===File sharing and its effects===
{{Main|File sharing#Effects of file sharing|l1=Effects of file sharing}}
A number of studies have found that file sharing has a negative impact on record sales. Examples of such studies include three papers published in the April 2006 issue of the ''Journal of Law and Economics'' (Liebowitz, Rob and Waldfogel, Zentner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Stan J. |last=Liebowitz |title=File Sharing: Creative Destruction or Just Plain Destruction? |journal=[[The Journal of Law &amp; Economics]] |volume=49 |number=1 |date=April 2006 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1086/503518 |jstor=10.1086/503518 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Rafael |last1=Rob |first2=Joel |last2=Waldfogel |title=Piracy on the High C's: Music Downloading, Sales Displacement, and Social Welfare in a Sample of College Students |journal=[[The Journal of Law &amp; Economics]] |volume=49 |number=1 |date=April 2006 |pages=29–62 |doi=10.1086/430809 |jstor=10.1086/430809 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Alejandro |last=Zentner |title=Measuring the Effect of File Sharing on Music Purchases |journal=[[The Journal of Law &amp; Economics]] |volume=49 |number=1 |date=April 2006 |pages=63–90 |doi=10.1086/501082 |jstor=10.1086/501082 |subscription=yes|citeseerx=10.1.1.571.6264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alejandro Zentner]] notes in another paper published in 2005, that music sales had globally dropped from approximately $38 billion in 1999 to $32 billion in 2003, and that this downward trend coincides with the advent of [[Napster (peer-to-peer)|Napster]] in June 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Alejandro Zentner, [http://www.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1452&amp;context=bejeap "File Sharing and International Sales of Copyrighted Music: An Empirical Analysis with a Panel of Countries"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis &amp; Policy'', Vol. 5, Issue 1 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Using aggregate data [[Stan J. Liebowitz]] argues in a series of papers (2005, 2012) that file sharing had a significant negative impact on record sales.

In March 2007 the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' found that [[CD]] sales had dropped 20 percent in one year, which it interpreted as the latest sign of the shift in the way people acquire their music. BigChampagne LLC has reported that around one billion songs a month are being traded on illegal file-sharing networks. As a result of this decline in CD sales, a significant amount of record stores are going out of business and “...making it harder for consumers to find and purchase older titles in stores.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117444575607043728|title = Sales of Music, Long in Decline, Plunge Sharply|last = The Wall Street Journal|date = 21 March 2007 |accessdate = 12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 19 December 2008, the ''Wall Street Journal'' reported the following:&lt;ref name = NoSuit&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122966038836021137?mod=googlenews_wsj|title = Music Industry to Abandon Mass Suits|accessdate = 23 December 2008|last = Sarah McBride and Ellen Smith|date = 19 December 2008 | work=The Wall Street Journal| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221233718/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122966038836021137.html?mod=googlenews_wsj| archivedate= 21 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
After years of suing thousands of people for allegedly stealing music via the Internet, the recording industry is set to drop its legal assault as it searches for more effective ways to combat online music piracy. The decision represents an abrupt shift of strategy for the industry, which has opened legal proceedings against about 35,000 people since 2003. Critics say the legal offensive ultimately did little to stem the tide of illegally downloaded music. And it created a public-relations disaster for the industry, whose lawsuits targeted, among others, several single mothers, a dead person and a 13-year-old girl. Instead, the Recording Industry Association of America said it plans to try an approach that relies on the cooperation of Internet-service providers.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Digital business models==
With the explosion of formats and the creation of legitimate digital content, the [[IFPI]] observed that three main business models have risen to dominance. They are a-la-carte, [[subscription]] service, and [[advertisement]]-based.&lt;ref name = IFPI/&gt;

===A-la-carte (Download Store)===
A-la-carte is a service that sells individual songs, typically for $0.99 and now $1.29. They are known to consumers as "Download Stores". The leading provider is [[iTunes Store]] ([[Apple Inc.]]), who surpassed [[Wal-Mart]] to become the US’s largest music retailer in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/04/03itunes.html|title = iTunes Store Top Music Retailer in the US|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = Apple Inc.|date = 3 April 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081123015344/http://www.apple.com./pr/library/2008/04/03itunes.html|archivedate = 23 November 2008|deadurl = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sector leaders include:
* [[iTunes Store]]
* [[Amazon.com]]
* [[7digital]]
* [[EMusic]]
* [[TuneTribe]]

Many hundreds more stores operate worldwide, often prominent only in particular countries or specialist genres. A third kind of operator never retails directly to the public, instead offering branded whitelabel stores and portals for organisations including bricks-and-mortar music stores, mobile telephony operators and ISPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/digital-music/article/where-can-i-get-music-online.aspx|title=BPI &amp;#124; Where can I get music online?|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whymusicmatters.org/find-music |title=Find Music &amp; Offers &amp;#124; Why Music Matters |accessdate=20 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65gMwicJb?url=http://www.whymusicmatters.org/find-music |archivedate=24 February 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some services which initially only offered streaming of tracks now also offer a-la-carte downloads, either through third parties (e.g. [[Spotify]]) or fully integrated ([[Deezer]], [[Juno Records|Juno Digital]], [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] etc.).

In 2009 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reported a [[price war]] between [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] and [[Amazon Music|Amazon MP3]]. Bill Carr, vice president of [[digital media]] for [[Amazon.com]] mentioned the following of [[digital music]] "one of the great benefits of the digital business versus the CD business is that we can experiment with price changes for an hour, a day or however long we like, with no impact on inventory".&lt;ref name = PriceWar&gt;Rolling Stone, Issue #1071, 2 February 2009, "Digital Albums Prices Slashed" p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subscription service===
A [[subscription]] service offers the consumer unlimited downloads for a monthly fee. This approach, according to the [[Open Music Model]], is theorized to maximize revenues in the long run. The sector leader is [[Napster (pay service)|Napster]],&lt;ref name = IFPI/&gt; which costs $12.95/month and offers 6 million downloads and now offers a $5 a month program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.napster.com|title=napster.com|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = Napster, LLC| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080905101348/http://www.napster.com./| archivedate=5 September 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napster's net revenue for the quarter ending on 30 June 2008 was $30.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://investor.napster.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=327525|title = Napster Reports $30.3 Million in First Quarter Sales and Positive Results From New MP3 Initiative|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = Napster, LLC|date = 11 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080916205901/http://investor.napster.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=327525 |archivedate = 16 September 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sector leaders include:
* [[Napster (pay service)|Napster]]
* [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]

===Advertisement-based service===
[[Advertisement]]-based services offer [[music]] free of charge to the consumer, while funding is derived from advertisement. The model is widespread as seen by the success of [[AOL Music]], [[Yahoo! Music]] and [[YouTube]] (multimedia provider). Many of these services are internet radio stations, as they offer continuous streaming music, while others are not continuously streaming. Many of these services offer multimedia or additional services. For example, [[MySpace]] (owned by [[Fox Interactive Media]]) offers [[social-networking]] as its flagship service. [[comScore]] reports the top 10 in internet radio viewership in the United States:

[[YouTube]] (owned by [[Google Inc.]]) is the premier site for finding music videos for both independent bands and mainstream bands that have released their music on CD or digitally, while also being useful for finding rare songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10125016-52.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1040_3-0-5|title = Finding rare songs on YouTube|accessdate = 23 December 2008|last = Terdiman|first = Daniel|date = 23 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube is a multimedia provider, so it is difficult to say how much entertainment it has provided to music consumers, however it did provide about one-third of all 11 billion online video views in the US in the month of April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://venturebeat.com/2008/06/17/online-video-continues-to-explode-googles-grip-tightens/|title = Online video continues to explode, Google’s grip tightens|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = Kaplan|first = Dan|date = 17 June 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202151657/http://venturebeat.com/2008/06/17/online-video-continues-to-explode-googles-grip-tightens/| archivedate= 2 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is also testing three new landing pages dedicated to the popular categories of news, movies, and music. Each page will be populated with the most popular content on the site related to that category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10126837-93.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1023_3-0-5|title = YouTube Launches HD Video Page|accessdate = 23 December 2008|last = Musil|first = Steven|date = 18 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have even hailed YouTube as being the "digital successor to [[MTV]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sci-tech-today.com/news/YouTube-Could-Become-Digital-MTV/story.xhtml?story_id=011001CEHOR9&amp;full_skip=1|title = YouTube Negotiating To Become a Digital MTV|accessdate = 9 March 2009|last = Jennifer LeClaire|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they seem to be positioning themselves in that manner. Currently, they have mixed relations with labels as evidenced by their icy relationship with [[Warner Music Group]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.macworld.co.uk/digitallifestyle/news/index.cfm?newsid=24110&amp;pagtype=allchandate|title = Warner threatens YouTube on music, pulls videos|accessdate = 9 March 2009|last = Lexton Snol|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more optimistic relationship with [[Universal Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10126439-93.html|title = Universal Music seeing 'tens of millions' from YouTube|accessdate = 9 March 2009|last = Greg Sandoval|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MySpace]] (owned by [[Fox Interactive Media]]) is also a key player and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reports that it hosts more than 70 million users monthly and that “visitors to the site can hear both [[Bob Dylan]]’s or [[The White Stripes]]' entire catalogue”. Unlike many services, MySpace has been successful in making copyright deals with the [[List of RIAA member labels#"Big Four" RIAA members|RIAA's "Big Four"]], which is [[Sony BMG]], [[Warner Music Group]], [[Universal Music]] and [[EMI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/23356455/myspace_music_takes_on_itunes|title = MySpace Music Takes on iTunes: Social-networking giant's new service streams millions of songs for free|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = Browne|first = David|date = 16 October 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081003194554/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/23356455/myspace_music_takes_on_itunes |archivedate = 3 October 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; in September 2008. In January 2009, MySpace made partnerships with the following independent labels: [[Nettwerk]], INgrooves, Iris Distribution, RoyaltyShare, and Wind-up Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10143398-36.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1023_3-0-5|title = New indie partnerships for MySpace Music|accessdate = 18 January 2009|last = Caroline McCarthy|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, [[CNET News]] reported that there are more than 5 million bands with music on the streaming-and-discovery music service, and more than 100 million playlists have been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10194538-36.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1023_3-0-5|title = Catching up with MySpace Music|accessdate = 12 March 2009|last = Caroline McCarthy|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pandora Radio|Pandora Internet Radio]] is distinctive from both YouTube and MySpace in that it offers consumers continuously [[streaming media]] rather than non-continuous music, which makes it highly similar to [[radio|terrestrial radio]] or [[television]]. However, it can be contrasted with radio in that it offers [[recommender system|music recommendation]]. YouTube is similar to Pandora in that it also offers recommendation, but is distinct in that content is [[User-generated content|user-generated]].

A new type of service that has also become popular is sites that allow consumers to pay what they wish or pay by advertising on social networking sites. Sites like [[NoiseTrade.com]] and comeandlive.com are examples of sites that sponsor artists and allow users to download music in exchange for advertising for the artist. Music is essentially free to users essentially costing only the time it takes to post information about the artist downloaded on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], or email. Another example was the release of the [[Radiohead]] album ''In Rainbows'' in which users could download the album and name their own price. The idea of [[pay what you want]] music consumption is new, but catching on with users and growing.

''Note: These figures represent data collected only from RIAA member labels, which constitutes only a portion of total online music exchanged.''

Statistical analysis suggests the large-scale change in distribution:
* Full-length CD distribution (by percentage of total music revenue) peaked in 2004.
* Between 2004 and 2007, Full-length CD sales have experienced a linear decline of around 2% annually. During this time period, Digital Download has increased from 0.9% to 11.2%.
* Of the over 10% of total market growth taken by Digital Download, roughly 8% came from losses in Full-length CD sales.
* Full-length cassettes experienced the most loss (-14.5% market share) in the 10-Year period, although most of the loss (-13.1%) was experienced from 1998-2003. In 2007, they were outsold by Vinyl.
* {{as of|2007}}, only two formats had greater than 10% of the market: Full-length CDs and Digital Download.
* The ratio of digital to analog sales in 2004 it was roughly 1:99, but by 2007 it was roughly 1:9.

In 2008, physical album sales fell 20 percent to 362.6 million from 450.5 million, while digital album sales rose 32 percent to a record 65.8 million units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tahoedailytribune.com/article/20090108/ENTERTAINMENT/901079974/1005/NONE&amp;parentprofile=1056&amp;title=Another%20tough%20year%20for%20music%20industry|title = Another tough year for music industry|accessdate = 12 January 2009|last = John Gerome|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proliferation of formats===
The advent of digital media has led to the sudden creation of many new music formats available to the average consumer. In 2003 there were less than 10 formats available, but by 2007 there were over 100. Today a single artist release can be packaged in multiple formats including video downloads, ringtones or mobile full tracks. As the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 2003, music distribution formats were numbered in single figures – today, they number in the hundreds…In the digital era, record companies are licensing music across a multitude of platforms, in scores of different formats and with hundreds of different partners.&lt;ref name = "IFPI"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_statistics/index.html|title = Digital Music Report_2008|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|date=January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081205010520/http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_statistics/index.html| archivedate= 5 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mobile music==
===MP3 players===
Rise of [[MP3 players]], which are [[consumer electronics]] devices that stores, organizes and plays [[audio file format|audio files]]. Some DAPs (digital audio players) are also referred to as [[portable media player]]s as they have image-viewing and/or video-playing support. The first mass-produced DAP was created in 1997 by SaeHan Information Systems, which domestically sold its “MPMan” player in the middle of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6450_7-5622055-1.html |title=Introducing the world's first MP3 player |last=Van Buskirk |first=Eliot |publisher=[[CNET]] |accessdate=30 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121150259/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6450_7-5622055-1.html |archivedate=21 January 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2001, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] (now known as Apple Inc.) unveiled the [[iPod classic#First generation|first generation]] [[iPod]], the 5&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive based DAP with a 1.8" [[Toshiba]] drive. With the development of a minimalistic [[user interface]] and a smaller form factor, the iPod was initially notable within users of the [[Macintosh]] community. In July 2002, Apple introduced the second generation update to the iPod. It was compatible with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] computers through [[Musicmatch Jukebox]] (now known as Y!Music Musicmatch Jukebox). The iPod series, which grew to include [[microdrive]] and flash-based players, has become the market leader in DAPs.

===Smartphones===
The 21st century saw the birth of [[3G|3G enabled mobile phones]], which enables network operators to offer users a wider range of more advanced services while achieving greater network capacity through improved [[spectral efficiency]].

The key advantage of 3G enabled phones over MP3 players is their greater web integration. This enables users to readily access a far larger quantity of songs than MP3 player users can. For an MP3 player, songs must be stored before the user leaves their computer, but with 3G enabled phones the device is not separated from the source. In 2009, it was projected that revenue from mobile media and entertainment (MME) services in the US would more than double by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.digmedia.org/content/mediacenter.cfm?content=industrytrends|title = US mobile media and entertainment market to see stronger growth from 2010 onward, says Analysys|accessdate = 17 February 2009|last = Digital Media Association|date=April 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090221021349/http://www.digmedia.org/content/mediacenter.cfm?content=industrytrends |archivedate = 21 February 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other noteworthy developments==
===In the courtroom===
* On 19 December 2008, the [[RIAA]] announced that it would stop suing file sharers, because the strategy is not working to stop the flow of illegal downloads. Instead, the RIAA is trying to work with [[ISP]]s to prevent P2P piracy. "The decision represents an abrupt shift of strategy for the industry, which has opened legal proceedings against about 35,000 people since 2003".&lt;ref name = NoSuit/&gt;
* On 18 June 2009 [[CNET News]] reported [[Jammie Thomas-Rasset]] was found guilty of willful copyright infringement in a Minneapolis federal court and must pay the recording industry $1.92 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10268199-93.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1023_3-0-5|title = Court orders Jammie Thomas to pay RIAA $1.92 million|accessdate = 18 June 2009|last = Sandoval|first = Greg|date = 18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legal battle, ''[[Capitol Records, Inc. v. Thomas-Rasset]]'', marked the first time the recording industry has argued a [[file-sharing]] case before a jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9791383-7.html?tag=mncol;txt|title = RIAA Winds Key Victory; Accused Fire Sharer Must Pay $220,000|accessdate = 18 June 2009|last = Sandoval|first = Greg|date = 4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In France, a new law regarding illegal downloading, called [[HADOPI]], is being debated. If passed, it would force the Internet provider to shut down the subscription while still receiving monthly payment. This double punishment is highly criticized.

===In politics===
* On 5 January 2009, president-elect [[Barack Obama]] appointed [[Thomas J. Perrelli]] to the position of [[United States Associate Attorney General]]. Perrelli represented the [[RIAA]] in a slew of cases, including a high-profile bid to unmask file sharers without the requirement of a judge reviewing the evidence first. Obama's selection of [[Joe Biden]] as [[vice president]] showed that the presidential hopeful was comfortable with someone with firmly pro-RIAA views. Biden urged the criminal prosecutions of copyright-infringing [[peer-to-peer]] users and tried to create a new federal [[felony]] involving playing unauthorized music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10133425-38.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1023_3-0-5|title = Obama picks RIAA's favorite lawyer for a top Justice post|accessdate = 9 January 2009|last = Declan McCullagh|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In video games===
* In the [[video game industry]], the music category overtook the sports category as no. 2 top category in sales, behind action. 58 percent of players played music games, second only to 65 percent who played action games. About 50 percent played sports games, down from 55 percent in 2007 and 62 percent in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://venturebeat.com/2008/10/20/music-video-games-overtake-sports-and-game-console-growth|title = Music video games overtake sports and game console growth|accessdate = 29 December 2008|last = Dean Takahashi|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video game industry was worth $22 billion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://venturebeat.com/2008/12/11/video-game-sales-defy-recession-rise-10-percent-in-november|title = Video game sales defy recession, rise 10 percent in November|accessdate = 29 December 2008|last = Dean Takahasahi|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'', which launched in 2007, has become the first single game to surpass $1 billion in sales. The announcement came during a [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] keynote by [[Activision]] Publishing CEO, Mike Griffith, and follows an announcement that the entire franchise had broken the same mark a year ago. Griffith said that ''[[Guitar Hero]]'''s monumental success has trickled down to other industries, most especially the struggling [[music industry]]. According to Griffith, sales of everything connected to ''Guitar Hero'', from music to real [[guitar]]s, has gone up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3172218|title = Guitar Hero 3 Surpasses $1 billion|accessdate = 12 January 2009|last = Kat Bailey|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work===
Rorty has primarily worked on problems in moral psychology and moral education. She is especially interested in the many distinctive –-and often conflicting—functions of morality as a social practice, as it sets prohibitions, projects ideals, defines duties, characterizes virtues. Exploring the dark side of some of the virtues—courage as bravado, integrity as moral narcissism, the ambivalence of love--, she has also analyzed the advantages of resistance to the obligations of morality: the benefits of self-deception, the lures of moral weakness, the wisdom of ambivalence, the hidden rationale of allegedly irrational emotions. She approaches many of these issues historically (through Aristotle, Spinoza, Hume and Freud) and anthropologically (projecting a study of exiles, immigrants, refugees. who perforce absorb a new set of ‘moral’ values.) She is presently finishing a book provisionally entitled ''On the Other Hand: The Ethics of Ambivalence''.

Rorty is the author of over 120 scholarly articles and the author or editor of more than a dozen scholarly books of original essays. A monograph, ''Mind in Action: Essays in Philosophy of Mind'', was published by Beacon Press in 1988 (paperback edition 1991). She also edited and contributed to ''Explaining Emotions'' (U. California Press, 1980), ''Essays on Aristotle’s Ethics'' (1980, U.California Press), and co-edited ''Essays on Aristotle’s De Anima'' (Oxford, 1992) with Martha Nussbaum. She initiated and served as general editor of ''Modern Studies in Philosophy'' (Doubleday-Anchor) and of ''Major Thinkers'' (University of California Press). Other notable books she edited include ''The Many Faces of Evil'' (Routledge, 2001), ''The Identities of Persons'' (1976, U. California Press) and ''The Many Faces of Philosophy'' (Oxford, 2000).

==Personal life==
Oksenberg Rorty, daughter of Polish Jews Klara and Israel Oksenberg, was born in Belgium  and emigrated with her parents to Virginia, where she was raised on a farm.&lt;ref name="My Life"&gt;{{cite web|title=My Life |url=http://www.mylife.com/l-amelie-rorty-e730609094322 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="American Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web |title=American Philosophy excluding Pragmatism |url=http://www.gach.com/gach/L1941-02.HTM |publisher=John Gach Books |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She enrolled at a young age at the University of Chicago, and went on to pursue a doctorate at Yale, where she married [[Richard Rorty]], a fellow graduate student.&lt;ref name="Critical Theory Archive"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Guide to the Richard Rorty Papers MS.C.017 |journal=UC Irvine, Critical Theory Archive, Online Archive of California |volume=MS.C.017 |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt9p3038mq/dsc/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They had a son, Jay, and divorced in 1972.&lt;ref name="Richard Rorty Obit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sanford |first=John |title=Richard M.

'''An Túr Gloine''' ({{IPA-ga|ənˠ ˈt̪ˠuːɾˠ ˈɡlˠɪnʲə|}}; [[Irish language|Irish]] for "The Glass Tower") was a [[cooperative]] [[studio]] for [[stained glass]] and ''[[opus sectile]]'' artists from 1903 until 1944,&lt;ref name="Gordon Bowe BC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon Bowe|first1=Nicola|title=The Tower of Glass An Túr Gloine and the early 20th century stained glass revival in Ireland|url=http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/towerofglass/towerofglass.htm|website=Building Conservation|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

==History==
An Túr Gloine was conceived of in late 1901 and established January 1903 at 24 Pembroke Street, [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], on the site of two former tennis courts.It was active throughout the first half of the 20th century. Affiliated artists included [[Michael Healy (artist)|Michael Healy]], [[Evie Hone]], [[Beatrice Elvery]], [[Wilhelmina Geddes]], [[Harry Clarke]], [[Catherine Amelia O’Brien|Catherine O'Brien]], [[Kathleen Quigly]], and founder [[Sarah Purser]].&lt;ref name="Gordon Bowe BC" /&gt; The original impetus for the project, spurred by the Irish cultural activist [[Edward Martyn]], was the building of the [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral in [[Loughrea]], [[County Galway]], which was to become St. Brendan's.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wallace, ''100 Irish Lives'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1983), p. 122 [https://books.google.com/books?id=lbv5ZSsoVHMC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22An+Tur+Gloine%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Purser and Martyn hoped to provide an alternative to the commercial stained glass imported from England and Germany for Irish churches and other architectural projects.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on stained glass, ''The Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture'', edited by W.J. McCormack (Wiley-Blackwell, 2001), p. 542 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ANgdh-3cMowC&amp;pg=PA542&amp;dq=%22An+Tur+Gloine%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Purser's knowledge of French and English medieval glass, together with her social connections and organizational skills, were crucial to the success of the cooperative.&lt;ref name="Gordon Bowe BC" /&gt;

A writer for ''[[Studio Magazine|The Studio]]'', a magazine of [[fine art|fine]] and [[applied art]], called the recently formed An Túr Gloine "perhaps the most noteworthy example of the newly awakened desire to foster Irish genius," describing it as "at once a craft school, where instruction in every detail connected with the designing and production of stained glass is given to the workers, and a factory from which some beautiful work has already appeared." The writer also extolled the economic benefits of an Irish glass industry to supply churches.&lt;ref&gt;E.D. (initials only), ''The Studio'' 33 (15 October 1904), pp. 260 and 262 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7fwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA260&amp;dq=%22foster+Irish+artistic%22+intitle:Studio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The studio is regarded as part of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]],&lt;ref name="online"&gt;Ellen Mary Easton McLeod, ''In Good Hands: The Women of the Canadian Handicrafts Guild'' (McGill-Queen's Press, 1999), pp. 55 and 68 (note 24) [https://books.google.com/books?id=npppnhZSmIIC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=ottawa+window+intitle:in+intitle:good+intitle:hands&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; but was infused also with the contemporary spirit of [[Celtic Revival|Irish revivalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Characterized, perhaps dismissively, as "[[Romanticism|romantic]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] fervour" in ''The Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture'', p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt; and drew on the [[Celtic art#Ireland|artistic tradition of Celtic]] [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]]. Ireland became an internationally renowned center of stained-glass art at this time, to a large extent as a result of An Túr Gloine.&lt;ref&gt;Terence Brown, ''Ireland: A Social and Cultural History, 1922 to the Present'' (Cornell University Press, 1985), p. 78 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1xwLMi6RaQcC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22An+Tur+Gloine%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online]; ''The Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture'', p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt; The studio was run by Purser until 1940, and she was succeeded by Catherine O'Brien who ran it until 1944.&lt;ref name="Gordon Bowe BC" /&gt; After which time O'Brien bought the studio and leased a large section of it to [[Patrick Pollen]].&lt;ref name=Doyle&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=Carmel|editor1-last=McGuire|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=James|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapter=O'Brien, Catherine Amelia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to literary culture==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
A commission for An Túr Gloine occasioned an outburst of criticism in [[Samhain magazine|''Samhain'' magazine]] from the [[Irish poetry|Irish poet]] [[W.B. Yeats]] on how the "[[Bourgeois personality|bourgeois mind]] is never sincere in the arts":

{{cquote|[[Galway]] [[convent]] a little time ago refused a fine design for stained glass, sent from Miss Sarah Purser's studio, because of the personal life in the faces and in the [[Attitude (art)|attitudes]], which seemed to them ugly, perhaps even impious. They sent to Miss Purser an insipid German [[Chromolithography|chromo-lithograph]], full of faces without expression or dignity, and gestures without personal distinction, and Miss Purser, doubtless because her enterprise was too new, too anxious for success, to reject any order, has carried out this ignoble design in glass of beautiful colour and quality.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Letters of W.B. Yeats'', edited by John Kelly and Ronald Schuchard (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 259, note 2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=k-DdGwpJb_wC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=%22An+Tur+Gloine%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''BRIC Arts Media''', usually styled '''BRIC Arts | Media''' or '''BRIC Arts | Media | Bklyn''' and best known as '''BRIC''' (standing for '''Brooklyn Information &amp; Culture'''), is a [[non-profit]] arts organization based in [[Brooklyn, New York]] founded in 1979 as the "Fund for the Borough of Brooklyn". Among its best known programming is the annual [[Celebrate Brooklyn]] summer concert series. Since the opening of their first permanent home, BRIC has played host to the ''On Air Readings'' and ''Look &amp; Listen Festival''.&lt;ref name=oar&gt;{{cite news|title=Bobby Cannavale, John Leguizamo, Rosie Perez &amp; More Set for Playing on Air Readings at BRIC House Next Month|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Bobby-Cannavale-John-Leguizamo-Rosie-Perez-More-Set-for-Playing-on-Air-Readings-at-BRIC-House-Next-Month-20140220#.Ux-9_V4m2Jg|accessdate=2014-03-12|newspaper=[[BroadwayWorld.com]]|date=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=akoz&gt;{{cite news|last=Kozinn|first=Allan|title=Look &amp; Listen Music Festival to Spread to Brooklyn|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/28/look-listen-music-festival-to-spread-to-brooklyn/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|accessdate=2014-03-14|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; BRIC also provides community access television for Brooklyn.&lt;ref name=dtwn&gt;{{cite news|title=BRIC House Set to Open Next Month|url=http://downtownbrooklyn.com/posts/arts-entertainment/bric-house-set-to-open-next-month|accessdate=2014-03-13|newspaper=Downtown Brooklyn|date=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leeser Architecture]]’s renovation and expansion of this existing, under-utilized building involves two user groups, BRIC Arts | Media |Brooklyn and UrbanGlass. The project includes a full renovation of the interior space to create new theaters, television broadcasting studios, art galleries, glass workshops, media labs, classrooms, administrative and operation offices, and support spaces.

==BRIC House==
Prior to the opening of BRIC House (in the former [[Strand Theatre (Brooklyn)|Strand Theater]] building on Fulton Street) in 2013, BRIC Arts Media (as BRIC) programmed in a number of locations around Brooklyn including the Rotunda Gallery&lt;ref name=dtwn/&gt; in [[Brooklyn Heights]]. The 40,000 square foot BRIC House allowed BRIC to present their music, arts and media programming under the same roof for the first time with a 3,000-square-foot public gallery, flexible performance space, and artist studios.&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite news|last=Dailey|first=Jessica|title=Inside the Brooklyn Cultural District's Newest Addition, BRIC House|url=http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2013/10/03/inside_the_bam_cultural_districts_newest_addition_bric_house.php|accessdate=2014-03-14|newspaper=[[Curbed]]|date=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hypa&gt;{{cite news|last=Meier|first=Allison|title=A Look Inside BRIC House, a New Arts Center in the booming Downtown Brooklyn Scene|url=http://hyperallergic.com/90790/a-look-inside-bric-house-a-new-arts-center-in-the-booming-downtown-brooklyn-scene/|accessdate=2014-03-12|newspaper=[[HyperAllergic]]|date=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also home to one of Brooklyn's three [[Hungry Ghost Cafe]] locations.&lt;ref name=hgb&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungry Ghost Brooklyn|url=http://hungryghostbrooklyn.com/|accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bjelaj Fortress''' locally known as ''Stari Grad Bjelaj'', is a Medievil town-fortress complex near the Village of [[Bjelaj]], [[Bosanski Petrovac]][[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

==Location==
Located on the edge of [[the Petrovac plain]] (or part thereof Bjelajsko fields), on the northern slope of the [[Osječenica]] mountain. The area around the city is uninhabited and lean. The whole complex is situated on a plateau about {{convert|850|m}} long.

==History==
On the south end of the northern half, there is a great fort, a prehistoric site from the Bronze and Iron Age. On the north end, there is a small fort. The fort itself has two parts: a medieval southern and northern [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] part. The medieval town has a ground plan of an irregular rectangle over 40 meters long and a width of about 35 meters.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalpark-una.ba/addDocuments/uploads/14666750291810023626.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; From the tower on the west side is the beginning of the remains of a large pen that was added along with the medieval city in the Ottoman period.

First mentioned in written sources in 1495 and named after the whiteness (or tint) by which it stood out above Bjelajsko field. Ownership is attributed to of King Vladislav II Treasurer, who in 1495 is recorded paying to [[Gašpar Perušić]] the sum of 30 [[forint]]s "to preserve his city of Belaj" (''egregio Caspar Perusyth pro conservatione castri sui Belay dati sunt 30 fl.''). This clearly shows the settlement was defended by this point. Ten years later, in 1505 had most of the city together with the [[Sokolac fortress]] and Ripač by Princess [[Beatrice Frankopan]], limbs Duke Johannes Corvinus, and is in her name all three cities managed kaštelan Dujam Orlovčić.

Between 1530 and 1537, Bjelaj (Bilaj) came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], becoming part of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]], the villagers and the cadillac Neretva. Already in 1540, it is mentioned for the first time on Bjelaj nahija, and later it is mentioned as Nahija Bjelaj-Blagaj, but soon falls under the cadiluk Kamengrad, which is mentioned as a cadil in the Bosnian or Klis sandbag. From 1562, Nađija Bjelaj was connected to the cadillac Novosel, who was in the cliché sandžak. It was noted that in 1577 a crew of 370 Ottoman mercenaries was placed in the fortress under the dizdar command. From 1592, the city was part of the Bihac captaincy, and from the 18th century to the composition of the Petrovac captaincy. Dizdar Bjelaj (Bilaja) Alijaga was in the demining commission with the Republic of Venice. In 1747 in Bjelaj there was a crew of 30 members and Dizdar Hasanag. According to the list of fortifications and weapons in them from 1833, in Bjelaj (Bilaj) there was 1 top of 12 pedals and 3 small canopies of 6 pedals.&lt;ref&gt;https://bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stari_grad_Bjelaj#cite_note-Kre%C5%A1evljakovi%C4%87-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description== 
Old town Bjelaj (Bilaj) has two parts: the southern medieval and northern Ottoman part. The medieval city has a layout of irregular rectangles over 40 m long (north-south) and about 35 m wide (east-west). The entrance to the city is in the northward.

===Medieval part=== 
It is half-closed, with partially preserved arches and doorways. In the northwest corner, there is a massive round tower 2/3 off the ramparts, about 16 m high. The entrance to the tower is at a height of about 4 m above the current level of the land. According to the outer form, it is assumed that the inside of the tower was divided into three levels: the ground floor or basement, the level at the entrance level, and the space above the entrance because the ceiling can be seen on the canvas wall continuously. East of the entrance are the remains of a narrow, hollow, heavily-walled area as high as the ramparts (15-16m). That space was built up beside the rampart. Only the upper part of it was preserved and probably served for the rise of soldiers to the top of the wall on which they were coarse, and sometimes small loopholes. On the ground are the remains of the eastern part of the longitudinal wall that forms a whole with the vertical rest of the described wall beside the wall. These remains of a wall on the ground share the easternmost part of the interior of the city from the west. After a few meters they are lost to the south, and on the west side towards the tower, they do not see traces. The impression is that it was part of some enclosure that protected the penetration into the city. The western side of the city was harder defensive because the enemy could draw from the back. The western ramparts are therefore monolithic and end up with clods, of which only a very small part has been preserved. Beneath the level of the chestnut tree, there are a number of stone consoles on the top of the ramparts that served as a wooden backbone. Below them is a series of shorter brackets embedded in a rampart. The eastern rampart was facing Bjelaysko polje. On it are 4 large loopholes semi-rounded. and on the west side towards the tower, they do not see traces. The impression is that it was part of some enclosure that protected the penetration into the city. The western side of the city was harder defensive because the enemy could draw from the back. The western ramparts are therefore monolithic and end up with clods, of which only a very small part has been preserved. Beneath the level of the chestnut tree, there are a number of stone consoles on the top of the ramparts that served as a wooden backbone.

Beneath the level of the chestnut tree, there are a number of stone consoles on the top of the ramparts that served as a wooden backbone. Below them is a series of shorter brackets embedded in a rampart. The eastern rampart was facing Bjelaysko polje. On it are 4 large loopholes semi-rounded.

They are designed to shoot from a wooden or stone platform in a standing position. On some of them, the vertical and horizontal, nicely carved stone blocks and slabs that were used as frames are still on the inside of the ramparts. Above the loophole is a horizontal array of holes for the ceiling beams above which there are stone consoles. From the ramparts, there is a view of the entire Bjelas field and the surrounding area. The southern slum is completely demolished. Towards the tower next to the western ramparts is the remains of the tank. The fortresses and towers of an older fortress were built of travertine blocks and broken stone. In front of the northern rampart and entrance to the old part of the city, there is a ditch that is saturated, but its contours can be identified.

===Ottoman part=== 
From the tower on the west side are the remains of a large patch which was built alongside the medieval city in the Ottoman era. The precinct is located north of the older part of the city, almost regular in a four-legged shape, 110 m long, about 40 m wide. Only parts of the western ramparts are preserved, up to a height of 2 m. According to the material, they are completely different from the walls of the medieval city. They were built from a finely broken stone blended with plenty of plaster. There was a small mosque in the backyard. Today, at its place, the hollow is filled with a bunch of stones. The entrance to the pavement was on the north wall. He was overwhelmed by a "shaggy bow". In this place, the overhead remains of the ramparts are barely visible or only its traces. The most well-preserved part of the Ottoman times is south and north of the medieval trench, along with the west side of the plateau. At the end of one section of the western ramparts, another entry appeared to be in that wall north of the ditch. Along the eastern side of the fortress is not preserved.

==Current state==
On-site inspection in February 2007, found that the medieval city was still quite well preserved, while only parts of the western wall remained from the Ottoman peninsula. In the walls of the medieval city, the holes from which the stone was taken were seen. It is exposed to deterioration due to neglect, lack of maintenance and absence of an appropriate management plan.

Today Old town Bjelaj is located in the contact zone with the National Park "Una", and in 2007 it was declared a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

A '''blacklight poster''' is a poster printed with inks which [[Fluorescence|fluoresce]] under a [[black light]].&lt;ref name=lincoln2004/&gt; The inks used contain [[phosphor]]s which cause them to glow when exposed to [[ultraviolet]] light emitted from black lights.&lt;ref name=mccleary2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harris2002/&gt; 

Although black lights date to 1903 with the development of [[Wood's glass]], fluorescent ink was not developed until 1932 when the Switzer brothers were inspired by a &lt;i&gt;Popular Science&lt;/i&gt; article to experiment in their father's pharmacy. Their [[Day-Glo Color Corp.]] marketed the ink chiefly to the military before a counterculture emerged to embrace the aesthetic.&lt;ref name="Ensminger"&gt;Ensminger, David. "Black Light Panthers: The Politics of Fluorescence," &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt; Vol. 5 No. 2 (July-August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s saw the pervasive use of illegal drugs, especially mass use of hallucinogenics such as LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), mescaline, and marijuana for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moss|first1=Gary|title=Hippie Artifacts:Mind Blowing Stuff to Collect|date=2003|publisher=Shiffer Publishing LTD&amp;Design|isbn=0-7643-1758-X|page=72url=http://www.schifferbooks.com/hippie–artifacts–mind–blowing–stuff–to–collect–1573.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the ability to glow and vibrate under ultraviolet light, the posters could simulate the sensations and visual distortions one experienced during an acid trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donahue|first1=Daniel|title=Ultraviolet 69 Classic Blacklight Posters from the Aquarian Age and Beyond|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=Abrams Image|location=China|isbn=0-8109-7999-3|page=6|url=http://www.abramsbooks.com/product/ultraviolet_9780810979994/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, blacklight posters emerged as part of the [[Psychedelia|psychedelic fashion scene]] between 1967 and 1969.&lt;ref name=menand2003/&gt; The style was popular in advertisements for concerts at venues like [[the Fillmore]] and [[Avalon Ballroom]], and further promoted and commercialized by companies like Pandora Productions (established in Minneapolis, 1964) and the Houston Black Light Company (Houston, 1969). Designs ranged from respectful copies of concert posters to prurient adolescent fantasies. At its height radical black artists found inspiration in the aesthetic, such as [[Faith Ringgold|Faith Ringgold's]] series of &lt;i&gt;Black Light&lt;/i&gt; paintings that eschewed any white pigment, or [[Barbara Jones-Hogu|Barbara Jones-Hogu's]] prints (especially &lt;i&gt;Relate to Your Heritage&lt;/i&gt;). Commercial producers happily reciprocated by incorporating [[blaxploitation]] themes into their posters, as in George Goode's series for the Houston Black Light Company and George Stowe Jr.'s work for One Stop Posters.&lt;ref name="Ensminger"/&gt;

Since then, the art form has gone out of fashion and is generally viewed as a relic of the 1970s.&lt;ref name=campbell2004/&gt; 

Although blacklight posters have continually been produced since the 1960s, there has been a resurgence in popularity since 2007 as blacklight and glow-in-the-dark parties have become more popular{{Citation needed|reason=Proof of increased glow-in-the-dark parties needed, as well as a location of the increase.|date=October 2017}}.  As of 2014, there are five companies actively producing new and classic flocked blacklight posters in a wide range of content, including music, nature, and pop culture.  The black parts of these posters are overlaid with black flocking, which gives it a velvet feel, and these are often referred to as velvet posters.
[[File:Mr. Experience.JPG|thumb|right|Poster using black light fluorescent inks.]] Artists continue to make use of the material, notably [[Dorothy Cross|Dorothy Cross']] 1998 &lt;i&gt;Ghost Ship&lt;/i&gt; (a decommissioned light ship painted to glow at night, evoking the pigment's original military purposes), or [[Hank Willis Thomas|Hank Willis Thomas']] 2014 screenprints &lt;i&gt;And I Can't Run&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Blow the Man Down&lt;/i&gt; (exposing black victims under fluorescent light, evoking the pigment's historic association with black radicalism).&lt;ref name="Ensminger"/&gt;

'''''Christina's World''''' is a 1948 painting by American painter [[Andrew Wyeth]] and one of the best-known American paintings of the middle 20th century. It is a [[tempera]] work done in a realist style, depicting a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house.&lt;ref name="moma"/&gt; It is on display at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York as part of its permanent collection.&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78455''Christina's World''] in the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The woman in the painting is Anna Christina Olson (3 May 1893 – 27 January 1968). She probably suffered from [[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease]], a genetic [[polyneuropathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hold-ho-woman-famous-painting-christinas-world-suffered-charcot-marie-tooth-disease-1558609 |title=Christina's World: Mystery illness of Andrew Wyeth's most famous painting discovered|date=6 May 2016|accessdate= 6 May 2016|first=Léa |last=Surugue|website=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 23rd Historical Clinicopathological Conference, University of Maryland School of Medicine, May 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Wyeth was inspired to create the painting when he saw her crawling across a field while he was watching from a window in the house. He had a summer home in the area and was on friendly terms with Olson, using her and her younger brother as the subjects of paintings from 1940 to 1968.&lt;ref name="timemag"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,962060,00.html| title=Andrew Wyeth's Stunning Secret| last=Corliss| first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Corliss| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date=1986-08-18|accessdate=2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olson was the inspiration and subject of the painting but she was not the primary model; Wyeth's wife Betsy posed as the torso of the painting.&lt;ref name="timemag"/&gt; Olson was 55 at the time that Wyeth created the work.&lt;ref name="timemag"/&gt;

The house depicted in the painting is known as the [[Olson House (Cushing, Maine)|Olson House]] in [[Cushing, Maine]] and is open to the public, operated by the [[Farnsworth Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.farnsworthmuseum.org/olson-house| title=The Olson House|publisher=Farnsworth Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Maine|National Historic Landmark]] and has been restored to match its appearance in the painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freepressonline.com/Content/Community-Events/Community-Events/Article/Olson-House-and-Farnsworth-Homestead-Open-for-Season-/128/787/45902 |title=Olson House and Farnsworth Homestead Open for Season  |last1=Museum |first1=Farnsworth |date=June 2, 2016 |website=www.freepressonline.com |publisher=The Free Press |access-date=October 28, 2016 |quote="The house’s exterior woodwork was restored...

==Reception and history==
''Christina's World'' was first exhibited at the Macbeth Gallery in Manhattan in 1948.&lt;ref name=Kimmelman&gt;{{cite news|last=Kimmelman|first=Michael|title=Andrew Wyeth, Painter, Dies at 91|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/arts/design/17wyeth.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=May 5, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received little attention from critics at the time, but [[Alfred Barr]], the founding director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA), bought the painting for $1,800. He promoted it at MoMA and it gradually grew in popularity over the years. Today, it is considered an icon of American art and is rarely loaned out by the museum.&lt;ref name=Esaak&gt;{{cite web|last=Esaak|first=Shelley|title=Christina's World by Andrew Wyeth|url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/famous_paintings/ss/andrew_wyeth_christinas_world.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', Christina's World is one of the two paintings hanging on the living room wall of "an elegant, anonymous hotel suite” to which the astronaut David Bowman is transported after passing through the Star Gate.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Arthur, C.

[[National Register of Historic Places]], Registration Form, Section 8, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; It does not appear in the [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|film adaptation]] of the novel.

The painting appears as a symbolic [[Theatrical property|prop]] in the film ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'' starring [[Tom Cruise]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/trivia Oblivion Trivia]. [[IMDb]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The life of Olson and her encounter with Wyeth is portrayed in  the novel ''A Piece of the World'' by [[Christina Baker Kline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/books/review/piece-of-the-world-christina-baker-kline.html |title=Mystery Woman: A Novel Explores the Story of Andrew Wyeth’s ‘Christina’s World’ |last=Aikman |first=Becky |work=The New York Times|date=Feb 24, 2017 |access-date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting appears in the 2016 British film ''[[War on Everyone]]'' during a scene where Terry looks at a reproduction hanging on a wall in Jackie's house, and comments: "It's kinda creepy. It's like something bad's gonna happen but there's nothing she can do about it."

The painting also briefly appears in the 2018 American film ''[[The Kindergarten Teacher (2018 film)|The Kindergarten Teacher]]'' during a scene where Lisa and Jimmy are touring the Museum of Modern Art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n1NP6w5lXs YouTube at 1:55]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Serbian culture}}
The '''Cinema of Serbia''' comprises the art of [[film]] and creative movies made within the nation of [[Serbia]] or by Serbian filmmakers abroad.

[[Serbia]] (both as an independent country and as of [[former Yugoslavia]]) has been home to many internationally acclaimed films and directors, and is considered to be the most successful Balkan nation in term of filming. Most of the prominent films from the Balkans are mainly from Serbia, and have acquired a great level of commercial successes.

==Serbian theatre and cinema==
Serbia has a well-established theatrical tradition with many theatres. The [[Serbian National Theatre]] was established in 1861 with its building dating from 1868. The company started performing opera from the end of the 19th century and the permanent opera was established in 1947. It established a ballet company.

[[Bitef]], Belgrade International Theatre Festival, is one of the oldest theatre festivals in the world. New Theatre Tendencies is the constant subtitle of the Festival. Founded in 1967, Bitef has continually followed and supported the latest theater trends. It has become one of five most important and biggest European festivals. It has become one of the most significant culture institutions of Serbia.

Serbian cinema dates back to 1896. with the release of the oldest movie in the Balkans, ''[[The Life and Deeds of the Immortal Vožd Karađorđe]]'', a biography about Serbian revolutionary leader, [[Karađorđe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/magazine/sr/story/411/Film/998168/Restauriran+najstariji+srpski+igrani+film.html |title=Restauriran najstariji srpski igrani film |language=sr |publisher=Rts.rs |date=26 November 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netsrbija.net/srpska-kultura-film-i-kinematografija.html |title=Razvoj filma i kinematografije u Srbiji |publisher=Netsrbija.net |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cinema was established reasonably early in Serbia with 12 films being produced before the start of [[World War II]]. The most notable of the prewar films was Mihailo Popovic's The Battle of Kosovo in 1939.

Cinema prospered after World War II. The most notable postwar director was [[Dušan Makavejev]] who was internationally recognised for ''[[Love Affair: Or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator]]'' in 1969 focusing on Yugoslav politics. Makavejev's ''Montenegro'' was made in Sweden in 1981. [[Zoran Radmilovic|Zoran Radmilović]] was one of the most notable actors of the postwar period.

Serbian cinema continued to make progress in the 1990s and today despite the turmoil of the 1990s. [[Emir Kusturica]] won two Golden Palms for Best Feature Film at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], for ''[[When Father Was Away on Business]]'' in 1985 and then again for ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'' in 1995. In 1998, Kusturica won a Silver Lion for directing ''[[Black Cat, White Cat]]''.

As at 2001, there were 167 cinemas in Serbia (excluding [[Kosovo]]) and over 4 million Serbs went to the cinema in that year. In 2005, ''[[San zimske noći]]'' (A Midwinter Night's Dream ) directed by [[Goran Paskaljevic|Goran Paskaljević]] caused controversy over its criticism of Serbia's role in the [[Yugoslav wars]] in the 1990s.

Several Serbian-American filmmakers have established a loose, intellectual multi-mediamaking tradition, working within prominent academic institutions and also creating works marked by high stylistic experimentation.  Three figures here would include [[Slavko Vorkapic]], creator of famed montage sequences for Hollywood films and Dean of the USC Film School; Vlada Petric, television and film director, archivist, and founding curator of the [[Harvard Film Archive]]; and [[Vladan Nikolic]], creator of the [[Zenith (film)|Zenith film]] and transmedia project as well as Professor at the New School for Social Media in New York City.

'''Classical Realism''' refers to an artistic movement in late-20th and early 21st century in which [[drawing]] and [[painting]] place a high value upon [[skill]] and [[beauty]], combining elements of 19th-century [[neoclassicism]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]].

==Origins==

[[Image:Jean-Leon Gerome Pollice Verso.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. ''[[Pollice Verso]]'' (1872). Classical Realism traces its lineage from Gérôme.]]

The term "Classical Realism" first appeared as a description of literary style, as in an 1882 criticism of [[John Milton|Milton]]'s poetry.&lt;ref&gt;S. Birch, ''The Educational Times''. Vol. 35, No. 249, January 1, 1882, page 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Its usage relating to the visual arts dates back to at least 1905 in a reference to [[Masaccio]]'s paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, Arthur; Blacker; Carlos; Slater, William Albert. ''Paintings of the Louvre, Italian and Spanish'', Doubleday, 1905, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It originated as the title of a contemporary but traditional artistic movement with Richard Lack (1928–2009), who was a pupil of Boston artist [[R. H. Ives Gammell]] (1893–1981) during the early 1950s. Ives Gammell had studied with [[William McGregor Paxton]] (1869–1941) and Paxton had studied with 19th-century French artist, [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904). In 1967 Lack established Atelier Lack, a studio-school of fine art patterned after the ateliers of 19th-century Paris and the teaching of the Boston impressionists. By 1980 he had trained a significant group of young painters. In 1982, they organized a traveling exhibition of their work and that of other artists within the artistic tradition represented by Gammell, Lack and their students. Lack was asked by Vern Swanson, director of the [[Springville Museum of Art]], [[Springville, Utah]], (the exhibition's originating venue), to coin a term that would differentiate the realism of the heirs of the Boston tradition from that of other representational artists. Although he was reluctant to label this work, Lack chose the expression "Classical Realism." It was first used in the title of that exhibition: ''Classical Realism: The Other Twentieth Century''. The term, "Classical Realism", was originally intended to describe work that combined the fine drawing and design of the European academic tradition as exemplified by Gérôme with the observed color values of the American Boston tradition as exemplified by Paxton.

In 1985 Atelier Lack began publishing the ''Classical Realism Quarterly'', featuring articles written by Richard Lack and his students to educate and inform the public about traditional representational painting. In 1988 Lack and several associates founded The American Society of Classical Realism, a society organized to preserve and promote fine representational art. The ASCR functioned until 2005 and published the influential ''Classical Realism Journal'' and ''Classical Realism Newsletter.''

In a separate vein, another major contributor to the revival of traditional drawing and painting knowledge is the painter and  art instructor Ted Seth Jacobs (born 1927), who taught students at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] and the New York Academy of Art in New York City.&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, Ted Seth.  ''Light for the Artist'',  Watson-Guptill Pubns (June 1988), {{ISBN|0-8230-2768-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their lineage is rooted in the [[Académie Julian]], the Golden Age of Illustration in New York, and the School of Paris. In 1987 Ted Seth Jacobs created his own art school, L'Ecole Albert Defois in Les Cerqueux sous Passavant, France (49).  Many of Jacobs' students such as Anthony Ryder and Jacob Collins became influential teachers and acquired their own student following.&lt;ref name="ryder"&gt;Ryder, Anthony.  ''The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing: A Contemporary Perspective on the Classical Tradition'',  Watson-Guptill; 1st edition (June 1, 1999), {{ISBN|0-8230-0303-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and philosophy==

Classical Realism is characterized by love for the visible world and the great traditions of Western art, including [[Classicism]], [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and [[Impressionism]].  The movement's aesthetic is Classical in that it exhibits a preference for order, beauty, harmony and completeness; it is Realist because its primary subject matter comes from the representation of nature based on the artist's observation.&lt;ref name="lack"&gt;Gjertson, Stephen.  ''Richard F. Lack: An American Master'',  American Society of Classical Realism: 2001, {{ISBN|0-9636180-3-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists in this genre strive to draw and paint from  the direct observation of nature, and eschew the use of photography or other mechanical aids. In this regard, Classical Realism differs from the art movements of [[Photorealism]] and  [[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealism]]. Stylistically, classical realists employ methods used by both [[Impressionist]] and [[Academic art]]ists.

Classical Realist painters have attempted to restore curricula of training that develop a sensitive, artistic eye and methods of representing nature that pre-date [[Modern Art]].  They seek to create paintings that are personal, expressive, beautiful, and skillful.  Their subject matter includes all of the traditional categories within Western Art: [[figurative art|figurative]], landscape, portraiture, indoor and outdoor genre and [[still life]] paintings.

A central idea of Classical Realism is the belief that the [[Modern Art]] movements of the 20th century opposed the tenets and production of traditional art and caused a general loss of the skills and methods needed to produce it. Modernism was antagonistic to art as it was conceived by the Greeks, resurrected in the [[Renaissance]], and carried on by the academies of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Panero|first=James|title=The New Old School|work=[[The New Criterion]]|volume=25|date=September 2006|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Classical Realist artists attempt to revive the idea of art production as it was traditionally understood: mastery of a craft in order to make objects that gratify and ennoble those who see them.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Roger:  "Why the Art World Is a Disaster", ''The New Criterion'', Volume 25, June 2007, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This craftsmanship is then applied to drawing, painting or sculpting contemporary subjects which the artist observes in the modern world.

Like the 19th-century academic models from which it derives inspiration, the movement has drawn criticism for the premium placed upon technical performance, a tendency toward contrived and idealized depictions of the figure, and rhetorical overstatement when applied to epic narrative.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; Maureen Mullarkey of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' referred to the school as "a contemporary style with retro appeal—like Chrysler's PT Cruiser".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/nothing-left-to-hide/41413/|author=Maureen Mullarkey|title=Nothing Left To Hide|work=[[New York Sun]]|date=October 12, 2006|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==

The Classical Realist movement is currently sustained through art schools based on the [[Atelier Method]]. Many present-day academies and ateliers follow the [[Charles Bargue]] drawing course. Richard Lack is generally regarded as the founder of the contemporary atelier movement. His school, Atelier Lack, was founded in 1969 and became a model for similar schools.&lt;ref name="atelier"&gt;Aristedes, Juliette.  ''Classical Drawing Atelier: A Contemporary Guide to Traditional Studio Practice'', Watson-Guptill Publications: 2006.  {{ISBN|0-8230-0657-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These modern ateliers are founded with the goal of revitalizing art education by reintroducing rigorous training in traditional drawing and painting techniques, employing teaching methodologies that were used in the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. These schools pass on a method of instruction which melds formal [[academic art]] training with the influence of the French [[Impressionists]].

Under the atelier model, art students study in the studio of an established master to learn how to [[drawing|draw]] and [[paint]] with realistic accuracy and an emphasis on rendering form convincingly. The foundation of these programs rests on an intensive study of the human figure, renderings of plaster casts of [[classical sculpture]], and the emulation of their instructors. The goal is to make students adept at observation, theory, and craft while absorbing classical ideals of beauty.&lt;ref name="atelier"/&gt;

'''Ecoarttech''' is an experimental, postdisciplinary, [[mixed media]] [[environmental art]] collaborative founded in 2005 by artist [[Cary Peppermint]] and literary writer/critic [[Leila Christine Nadir]]. The collaborative explores the complex relationships between modernity, technologies, networks, and concepts of nature and culture. Merging primitive with emergent technologies, ecoarttech’s work investigates the overlapping terrain between “nature,” built environments, mobility, and electronic spaces.&lt;ref name="ecoarttech"&gt;[http://ecoarttech.org/about Ecoarttech website.]&lt;/ref&gt; In furtherfield.org, Sophia Kosmaoglou writes, "Refusing to regard technology merely as a tool, Ecoarttech expand the uses of mobile technology and digital networks revealing them to be fundamental components of the way we experience our environment... By drawing our attention to the increasing replacement or mediation of physical experiences by technology, Ecoarttech challenge the widely reproduced distinction between nature and culture." &lt;ref&gt;Sophia Kosmaoglou, [http://www.furtherfield.org/features/interviews/interview-leila-nadir-and-cary-peppermint-ecoarttech "Interview with Leila Nadir and Cary Peppermint of Ecoarttech," Furtherfield.org] (April 20, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''visualMAG'', Teresa de Andrés describes the artists as "determined to blur the frontiers between city and countryside by using technologies in a creative way... they invite us to lose ourselves in unexplored lands, sinuous urban alleys and arid mountains to the south of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://visualmag.net/interviews/ecoarttech-the-wildness-in-the-city "The wildness in the city,"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130222091256/http://visualmag.net/interviews/ecoarttech-the-wildness-in-the-city |date=2013-02-22 }} Interview with Teresa de Andrés, ''visualMAG'' (June 13, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eclipse==

In 2009, ecoarttech launched "Eclipse," an internet-based work commissioned by Turbulence of New Radio and Performing Arts, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turbulence.org/Works/eclipse/ Eclipse], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and Untitled Landscape #5, a digital environmental artwork commissioned by the [[Whitney Museum of Art]], as part of the Sunrise/Sunset series inaugurated in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Untitled Landscape #5, [http://whitney.org/Sunset Whitney Museum of American Art Sunrise/Sunset Series], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ecoarttech worked with the University of North Texas on a work exploring the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] Basin of [[North Texas]] and unique, man-made waterbody called [[Soil Conservation Services Hickory Creek Basin Retarding Pond 16]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.unt.edu/news/ecoarttech-lecture-launches-waterways-2010-and-fluid-frontier-initiatives "EcoArtTech lecture launches WaterWays 2010 and Fluid Frontier initiatives," UNT News and Events]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indeterminate Hikes+==

In 2011, ecoarttech released Indeterminate Hikes+, a mobile phone app that they say "imports" the rhetoric of wilderness into everyday life through Google-mapped hiking trails, the app attempts to inspire a sense of ecological wonder at usually disregarded spaces, such as city sidewalks, alleyways, and apartment buildings." In an interview, they reported their goal to be the following: "We wanted to see what would happen if a walk down a sidewalk were treated as a wilderness excursion. What if we consider the water dripping off an air-conditioner with the same attention that we give a spectacular waterfall in the wilderness?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.furtherfield.org/features/interviews/interview-leila-nadir-and-cary-peppermint-ecoarttech "Interview with Leila Nadir and Cary Peppermint of Ecoarttech."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

The '''European Academy of Music Theatre''' ({{lang-de|Europäische Musiktheater-Akademie}}, abbreviated '''EMA''') is a [[Vienna]] based, non-profit institute which seeks to promote not only a pan-European but also international network for those active in the theory and praxis of [[Music theatre|Music Theatre]]. The organisation frequently holds symposia at various European cities and publishes their proceedings. The Academy cultivates and optimises the collaboration of professional activities throughout [[Europe]] and beyond.

== History ==
On 26 May 1992 the European Academy of Music Theatre  was founded in Prague's Ständetheater by the [[Forschungsinstitut für Musiktheater|Research Institute for Music Theatre Thurnau]] ([[Germany]]), [[Vanemuine]] Theatre, [[Tartu]] ([[Estonia]]), Academy of Sciences, [[Prague]] ([[Czech Republic]]) and the Department for Theatre, Film and Media Studies, [[University of Vienna]] ([[Austria]]).

During its period of gestation the Academy's main task was to provide support and knowledge to partners from Eastern Europe. After the completion of numerous projects and collaborations, the EMA increasingly positioned itself as a dialogue board for those professionally active in Music Theatre. This is achieved by establishing contacts between scientific researchers and those involved in music theatre affiliated domains. At its regular symposia EMA provides its members and associates a high-profile forum for exchanging experience and knowledge as well as for presenting latest developments in research, documentation and music theatre.

Since 1992 the European Academy of Music Theatre held fourteen symposia in different European countries, e.g. [[Russia]], [[Portugal]], [[France]] and [[Switzerland]]. Some of the analysed subjects have been organising and managing opera houses, historiography, as well as aspects of contemporary staging concepts.

At the 2011 general meeting [[:de:Dominique Meyer|Dominique Meyer]] and [[Kasper Holten]] have been appointed President and Vice President, respectively, and British musicologist [[John Deathridge]] has been elected new Member of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiktheater-akademie.eu/new-board-elected-meyer-p-holten-vp-deathridge-schade-new-members/ "New Board elected: Meyer (P), Holten (VP); Deathridge, Schade new Members"], European Academy of Music Theatre, 7 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2013 general meeting in London the director of De Vlaamse Opera (Antwerp), Aviel Cahn, has been elected new Member of the Board.

At the 2015 general meeting, held in Vienna, English composer [[Thomas Adès]], Maltese Tenor [[Joseph Calleja]], and Italian musicologist Alessandro Di Profio have been elected into the Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiktheater-akademie.eu/17995/ "New board elected: Thomas Adès, Joseph Calleja and Alessandro Di Profio new members"] European Academy of Music Theatre, 10 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016 the Australian Conductor [[Simone Young]] was appointed Member of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiktheater-akademie.eu/conductor-simone-young-new-member-of-the-board/ Simone Young new Member of the Board, 16 March 2016]; Retrieved 16 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Co-operation Partners ==
To emphasise each symposium's key aspect, the EMA co-operates with select organisations. Thus conferences with renowned partners such as the [[Vienna State Opera]], the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] in [[Paris]] and the [[Teatro Nacional de São Carlos]] in [[Lisbon]] as well as the [[European Forum Alpbach]] and the [[University of Zurich]] could be held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiktheater-akademie.eu/partners/ "Partners"] European Academy of Music Theatre, 20 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''F-rating''' is a rating to highlight women on screen and behind the camera.&lt;ref&gt;http://f-rated.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;
Developed at [[Bath Film Festival]] in 2014, the '''F-rating''' was inspired by the [[Bechdel test|Bechdel Test]] based on a 1985 cartoon strip&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/the-rule|title=dykestowatchoutfor.com  » Blog Archive   » The Rule|website=dykestowatchoutfor.com|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Alison Bechdel]], and popularised in the 2010s by [[Anita Sarkeesian]]'s Feminist Frequency blog, and by Ellen Tejle's A-rating&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-listfilm.com/ A-rating]&lt;/ref&gt; in Swedish cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bechdeltestfest.com/2015/04/10/we-talk-to-ellen-tejil-founder-of-a-rate/ |title=We talk to: Ellen Tejle founder of A Rate! |work=The Bechdel Test Fest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521164412/http://bechdeltestfest.com/2015/04/10/we-talk-to-ellen-tejil-founder-of-a-rate/ |archivedate=2015-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticisms of the A-rating, Swedish film theorists Ingrid Ryberg, Anu Koivunen and Laura Horak wrote, "The A rating has proved to be an activist provocation that works, and it is important to ask why... The A rating is not about classifying films as feminist or not feminist. It aims to alert viewers who find female sociality compelling to films they might like, and so challenge the industry to make more such films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/27/swedish-cinema-bechdel-test-works|title=Swedish cinema's use of the Bechdel test is a provocation that works|author=Anu Koivunen|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival developed the F-rating in October 2014 "to take it a step further and highlight films which either had a senior figure in production who was female—a director or a screenwriter—or had very strong female leads or women's issues," according to festival director and F-rating founder Holly Tarquini.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/bath-film-festival-2014-movies-with-strong-female-credentials-to-receive-special-frated-certificate-9849238.html|title=Bath Film Festival 2014: Movies with strong female credentials to receive special F-rated certificate|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarquini told the [[BBC]] that films had to meet at least one of three criteria to receive the rating: "If our films have a female director, a female lead who is not simply there to support the male lead, or are specifically about women then they will receive an F-rated stamp of approval." &lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-29739874|title='F-rated' films shown at Bath Film Festival|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the F-rated founder, Holly Tarquini was invited to deliver a TED talk at TEDxYouth@Bath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Stories Shape Us {{!}} Holly Tarquini {{!}} TEDxYouth@Bath|date=2016-12-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMEajG_cvC0&amp;t=1s|accessdate=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==

The F-rating is a reaction to a phenomenon known as the [[celluloid ceiling]], which has been documented internationally. "[[British Film Institute|BFI]] figures showed that in 2011, 15% of all UK films released were directed by women, but in 2012, this went down to 7.8%.",&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; while a study by "the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University found females made up 15 per cent of protagonists, 29 per cent of major characters and 30 per cent of all speaking characters in the 100 top-grossing films of 2013."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

==Bath Film Festival 2014: first implementation==

Seventeen of the forty-two films received the F-rating, included the First World War drama [[Testament of Youth]], based on [[Vera Brittain]]’s memoir, and director Jean-Marc Vallée’s true-life tale Wild, starring [[Reese Witherspoon]].

==Subsequent implementation==

In February 2015, the Bath Comedy Festival announced that it would be the UK's first F-rated comedy festival, with performers including [[Viv Groskop]] and [[Helen Lederer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bathcomedy.com/f-rating|title=Bath Comedy Festival - F-Rating|work=bathcomedy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, Komedia Bath arranged a meeting to encourage all Bath festivals, including the [[Bath Festival of Children's Literature]] and [[Bath International Music Festival]], and arts organisations to make [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] the first F-rated city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komedia.co.uk/bath/komedia-bath-bids-to-make-bath-the-first-f-rated-city/ |title=Komedia  » Blog Archive   » Komedia Bath bids to make Bath the first F-Rated city |work=komedia.co.uk }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 Bath Film Festival programme was 45% F-rated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bathfilmfestival.org.uk/content/uploads/2014/07/Bath-Film-Festival-2015.pdf|title=Bath Film Festival 2015 programme|last=|first=|date=November 2015|website=bathfilmfestival.org.uk/|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted more attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34982615|title=Can F-rated films help overcome sexism in Hollywood?|last=Youngs|first=Ian|date=2015-12-04|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 all the independent cinemas and film festivals in the UK were invited to join the F-rating with dozens signing up to F-rated their programme.&lt;ref&gt;http://f-rated.org/we-f-rate/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 The Barbican became the 40th organisation to adopt the rating.

==F-rated keyword added to IMDb==

In January 2017, the F-rated keyword was added to [[IMDb]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-39132867&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 2017, there were over 22,400 films on IMDb tagged with the F-rated keyword.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/search/keyword?keywords=f-rated&lt;/ref&gt;

The rating was defended by [[GQ|GQ Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gq.com/story/please-dont-use-imdbs-new-feature-to-be-a-dick&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fritz Hansen''', also known as '''Republic of Fritz Hansen''', is a Danish furniture design company. Designers who have worked for Fritz Hansen include [[Arne Jacobsen]] (1902–1971), [[Poul Kjærholm]] (1929–1980), [[Hans J. Wegner]] (1914–2007) and [[Piet Hein (Denmark)|Piet Hein]] (1905–1996).

==History==

Fritz Hansen was founded in 1872, when Fritz Hansen, a Danish carpenter, founded his own furniture company and in 1915 introduced his first chair in steam bent wood. In 1934, Fritz Hansen began his collaboration with [[Arne Jacobsen]] resulting in some of the famous, classic icons of Danish Design including the '[[Ant (chair)|Ant]]' (1952), the '[[Model 3107 chair|Series 7]]' (1955), the '[[Grand Prix (chair)|Grand Prix]]' (1957) the '[[Swan (chair)|Swan]]' (1958), and the '[[Egg (chair)|Egg]]' (1958).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/arne-jacobsen-the-man-who-invented-a-golden-egg-454283.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous collaborations have resulted in [[Piet Hein (Denmark)|Piet Hein]]'s super-elliptical table from 1968 and in 1982 Fritz Hansen acquired the rights to a major part of [[Poul Kjærholm]]'s furniture collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danishwayofliving.com/Fritz_hansen/Fritz1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s continuing into the new millennium, Fritz Hansen has added new designs to the collection including the Essay table by Cecilie Manz, T-NO1 by [[Todd Bracher]], RIN chair by Hiromichi Konno, Plano tables by [[Pelikan Design]] and the Ice series by Kasper Salto.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dexigner.com/news/15302&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gyula Benczúr - Self-portrait.jpg|thumb|215px|Self-portrait (1917)]]
'''Gyula Benczúr''' (28 January 1844, [[Nyíregyháza]] - 16 July 1920, [[Szécsény]]) was a [[List of Hungarian painters|Hungarian painter]] and art teacher. He specialized in portraits and historical scenes.

==Biography==
His family moved to [[Košice|Kassa]] when he was still very young and he displayed an early talent for drawing. He began his studies in 1861 with [[Hermann Anschutz]] and Johann Georg Hiltensperger (1806-1890). From 1865 to 1869, he studied with [[Karl von Piloty]].

He achieved international success in 1870 when he won the Hungarian national competition for historical painting with his depiction of King Stephen's baptism. He then assisted Piloty with the [[fresco]]es at the [[Maximilianeum]] and the [[Rathaus]] in [[Munich]] and illustrated books by the great German writer, [[Friedrich Schiller]]. King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig II]] of Bavaria gave him several commissions.

He was named a Professor at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]], in 1875. Soon after, he built a home in Ambach on [[Lake Starnberg]]; designed by his brother Béla. In 1883, he returned to Hungary, where he continued to be an art teacher. One of his most distinguished pupils was the Swiss-born American painter [[Adolfo Müller-Ury]]. Benczúr was later a favorite among the Hungarian upper-class, painting numerous portraits of kings and aristocrats. He also created some religious works; notably altarpieces for [[St. Stephen's Basilica]] and [[Buda Castle]].

He was an honorary member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. Streets have been named after him in [[Balassagyarmat]], [[Balatonkenese]], [[Berettyóújfalu]], [[Bonyhád]], Budapest, [[Debrecen]], [[Jászberény]], [[Komló]], [[Pécs]], [[Szabadszállás]], [[Szeged]] and Košice.  His daughters Olga (1875-1962) and Ida (1876-1970) also became well-known artists.

==Education==
Huxley was born in [[Surrey]] in 1965.  He studied at [[Berkshire College of Art and Design]] (1985&amp;ndash;1986) and [[Nottingham Trent Polytechnic]] (1986&amp;ndash;1989) and graduated from the latter with a BA (Hons) in Fine Art in 1989.  He studied for a Diploma in Fine Art at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] (1989&amp;ndash;1992).

==Professional life==
Huxley's work is featured by Galerie Olivier Waltman&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galeriewaltman.com/Jonathan_Huxley.html Huxley entry, Galerie Olivier Waltman]&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris, the Crane Kalman Gallery&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cranekalman.com/artist/jonathan-huxley Huxley entry, Crane Kalman Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; in London and Waltman Ortega Fine Art&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waltmanortega.com/Jonathan_Huxley.html Huxley entry, Waltman Ortega Fine Art]&lt;/ref&gt; in Miami.

==Works==
The partnership between Edward Birchall, who had practised in Leeds since the early 1860s,&lt;ref name="Birchall bio"/&gt; and John Kelly, who had previously been in partnership with Richard Life Adams (1840–83), was established in 1886.&lt;ref name="Victorian"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/leeds/13.html | title=Former Church Institute, corner of Albion Place and Lands Lane | work=The Victorian Web | date= 14 March 2012|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church of St Mary of Bethany, [[New Wortley]], Leeds was one of Kelly &amp; Birchall's earliest projects. Initially worked on by [[Adams &amp; Kelly]], Kelly &amp; Birchall took it to completion. Built in 1885 at a cost of £5,600, it featured a [[spire]] of 135 feet and a brick-lined interior. St Mary of Bethany was demolished in 1975.&lt;ref name="Leodis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leodis.net/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=2003520_14544314| title=St Mary of Bethany Church, demolition |work=Leodis&amp;nbsp;– a photographic archive of Leeds |accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more of Kelly &amp; Birchall's Leeds buildings have also since been demolished. The original All Hallows Church, on the corner of Hyde Park Road and Regent Terrace, Leeds, built in 1876 at an estimated cost of £10,585, was destroyed by fire on 27 April 1970, though the [[vicarage]] remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allhallowsleeds.org/about/history/|title=History|publisher=All Hallows Church, Leeds |accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic church of St Francis of Assisi, Manor Road, [[Holbeck]], built in 1896, was closed and demolished in 1979.&lt;ref name="Minnis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://services.english-heritage.org.uk/ResearchReportsPdfs/020_2008WEB.pdf |title=religion and place in Leeds&amp;nbsp;– A Survey and Gazetteer of Places of Worship 1900–2005 |first=John |last=Minnis |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |year=2008 |issn=1749-8775 |accessdate=27 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323162640/http://services.english-heritage.org.uk/ResearchReportsPdfs/020_2008WEB.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Kelly''' went on to design several notable churches, including [[All Saints' Church, Petersham (London)|All Saints' Church, Petersham]]&lt;ref name="Petersham"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[The Buildings of England]]&amp;nbsp;– London 2: South | publisher=[[Penguin Books]] | author=[[Bridget Cherry|Cherry, Bridget]] and [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner, Nikolaus]]| year=1983 | location=London | page=514 | isbn=0-14-0710-47-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]] (Grade II listed, and now a private residence).

Towards the end of his career, Kelly was short-listed for, but failed to win, the contract for the [[Leeds Cathedral|Cathedral Church of St Anne's, Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taking-stock.org.uk/Home/Dioceses/Diocese-of-Leeds/Cathedral-Church-of-St-Anne-Leeds |title=Leeds&amp;nbsp;– Cathedral Church of St Anne |work = Taking Stock: Catholic Churches of England &amp; Wales|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approaching retirement, Kelly established a new practice, ''John Kelly &amp; Sons'', in [[Oxford Street]], London. The church of St Alban and St Stephen in [[St Albans]] dates from this time.&lt;ref name="StAlbans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taking-stock.org.uk/Home/Dioceses/Archdiocese-of-Westminster/St-Alban-and-St-Stephen-St-Albans| title=St Alban and St Stephen&amp;nbsp;– St Albans |work = Taking Stock: Catholic Churches of England &amp; Wales|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following John Kelly's death in 1904, his son Claude Kelly took over the practice. The design of [[St Peter's Church, Aldrington]] in [[Hove]] (Grade II listed), attributed to Claude, is believed to have also been worked on by his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1209728|desc=St Peter's Church, Aldrington|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Birchall''''s other work includes the country house Tylney Hall in [[Hampshire]], built in 1879, which is Grade II listed&lt;ref name="Tylney Hall"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1000176 |desc=Tylney Hall |accessdate=27 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now a hotel,&lt;ref name="Tylney Hall Hotel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tylneyhall.co.uk/history-tylney-hall | title=History | publisher=Tylney Hall Hotel | accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carlton Hill [[Friends Meeting House]] (1868) which was the principal [[Quaker]] Meeting House in Leeds.

'''Khorramabad''' {{pronunciation|Khorramabad.ogg}} ({{lang-fa|خرم‌آباد}} -  also [[Romanize]]d as '''Khorramābād''', '''Khoramabad''', '''Khurramabad''', '''Khorram Abad''' and '''Khur Ramābād''')&lt;ref&gt;{{GEOnet3|-3071194}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a city and capital of [[Lorestan Province]], [[Iran]]. At the time of the 2006 census, its population was 328,544, in 75,945 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{IranCensus2006|15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khorramabad is situated in the [[Zagros Mountains]]. [[Khorramabad Airport]] is 3&amp;nbsp;km south of the city proper.

The city population is predominantly [[Lurs|Lur]] and [[Lak people (Iran)|Lak]], although the two groups are closely related.&lt;ref&gt;Anonby, Erik John [http://anonby.balafon.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/jra-172-171-197.pdf "Update on Luri: How many languages"] ''JRAS (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society) Series 3'' 13(2): pp.&amp;nbsp;171&amp;ndash;197, p.183, {{doi|10.1017/S1356186303003067}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although not a major tourist destination, it is quite scenic and possesses several attractions, such as five [[Paleolithic]] cave-dwelling sites.&lt;ref&gt;Baumler, Mark F. and Speth, John D. (1993) "A Middle Paleolithic Assemblage from Kunji Cave, Iran" pp. 1&amp;ndash;74 ''In'' Olszewski, Deborah and Dibble, Harold Lewis (editors) (1993) ''The Paleolithic prehistory of the Zagros-Taurus'' The University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{ISBN|978-0-924171-24-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the city center, a tall citadel called [[Falak-ol-Aflak]] (''The Heaven of Heavens''), a relic of the [[Sassanid]] era, is now a nationally popular museum.

Economically, it is the regional base of the [[agriculture|agricultural]] industry.

==History==

===Pre-Islamic era===
[[File:Susa-destruction.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Elam]] and Khaydalu destruction by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]]]

====Khaydalu====
Khaydalu was an important city of the [[Elam]] civilization. The city of Shapurkhast was built on the ruins of Khaydalu on the orders of [[Shapur I]] [[Sasanid]]. Many experts believes that the ancient city of Khaydalu was the core of modern
Khorramabad.

====Shapurkhast====
In the texts of historians Shapurkhast has been considered one of the most important and developed cities of the region during this period. [[Falak-ol-Aflak]] castle ( Dež-e Shāpūr-Khwāst) was built by [[Shapur I]] the [[Sasanid]].

===Islamic era===
Probably in the late seventh century CE, Shapurkhast was destroyed and the people of Shapurkhast moved to the western part of Falak-ol-Aflak Castle, which offered plenty of water as well as safety.

[[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] writes: Khorramabad was a beautiful city, now it is destroyed.

====Hazaraspids====
The founder of the Hazaraspid dynasty was [[Abu Tahir ibn Muhammad]], a descendant of the [[Shabankara]] chieftain [[Fadluya]]. Fadluya was initially a commander of the [[Salghurids]] of Fars and was appointed governor of [[Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province|Kuhgiluya]]&lt;ref&gt;B. Spuller,[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v2f8/v2f8a075.html Atabakan-e Lorestan]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Encyclopædia Iranica.&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually gained independence in [[Luristan]] and extended his realm as far as [[Isfahan]]. He assumed the prestigious title of ''[[atabeg]].

====Safavid dynasty====
During the reign of the [[Safavid dynasty]], Khorramabad was the administrative center of [[Luristan]] Province. In the wake of the demise of the Safavids, after the signing of the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)]] with [[Imperial Russia]], the [[Ottomans]] conquered Khorramabad on 6 September 1725.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somel|first1=Selcuk Aksin|title=Historical Dictionary of the Ottoman Empire|date=2003|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810866065|page=xlvi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGZQL41tg_oC&amp;pg=RA1-PR46&amp;dq=ottomans+khoy&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwia9Zizp4nLAhUFkiwKHTtBCDYQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ottomans%20khoy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Xuramabad city.jpg|left|thumb|Khorramabad city - [[Luristan]]]]

====Qajar dynasty====
In this period, the city of Khorramabad was limited to environs of [[Falak-ol-Aflak Castle]].This period was the beginning of a migration of people from small villages into Khorramabad. The increase in population led to the expansion of the city and the creation of new districts.

====Pahlavi dynasty====
Khorramabad Municipality was formed in 1913 and the first city council, consisting of seven members, was formed in 1916.

== Geography and climate ==
Khorramabad has what is classed under the [[Köppen climate classification]] as a [[semi-arid]] (''BSh'') climate with continental influences, owing to its high altitude making it much wetter than lowland cities like Baghdad or cities more shielded from the [[Zagros Mountains]] like [[Esfahan]] and [[Tehran]]. It remains extremely hot in the summer even with very low humidity, but the winter is sufficiently wet for rainfed agriculture.

=== Falak-ol-Aflak Castle ===
[[File:Falak ol aflak night.jpg|thumbnail|[[Falak-ol-Aflak Castle]]]]
[[Falak-ol-Aflak Castle]], Dež-e Shāpūr-Khwāst, Falak-ol-Aflak Castle, known in ancient times as Dezbaz as well as Shapur-Khast, is one of the most impressive castles in Iran. It is situated on the top of a large hill with the same name within the city of Khorramabad, the regional capital of Lorestan province. The Khorramabad River runs past the eastern and south-western side of the Falak-ol-Aflak hill providing the fortress with an element of natural protection. Today, the western and northern sides of the hill are bordered by the residential districts of Khorramabad.
This gigantic structure was built during the [[Sassanid era]] (226–651). It has been known by a number of names since it was built over 1800 years ago. Recorded names have referred to it as Shapur-Khast or Sabr-Khast fortress, Dezbaz, Khorramabad castle, and ultimately the Falak ol-Aflak Castle.
The foundations of the actual castle measure approximately 300 meters by 400 meters. The height of the entire structure, including the hill, reaches up to 40 meters above the surrounding area. This space is divided into four large halls, and their associated rooms and corridors. The rooms all surround two courtyards with the following measurements: the first courtyard measures 31×22.50 meters and the second 29x21 meters. . When originally built the castle used to have 12 towers, but only 8 remain standing today. The building's entrance is situated towards the north, within the body of the north-western tower.

=== Gerdab sangi ===
[[Gerdab Sangi]] is located in Takhti Square in Khorramabad, Lorestan and is made of stones and plaster. It dates back to the Sassanid era (224-651 CE) and is a circular whirlpool built for the purpose of accurate and optimal distribution of water. Encircling several springs, the edifice sits near the prehistoric Qomri Cave. The construction was once used for rationing and distributing potable and agricultural water among local population and farmers. Its surrounding cylindrical stone wall has a height of 10 meters and a diameter of 18 meters.
There are a few different-sized outlets in the wall for controlling the flow of water into a canal on the west of the structure. While originally there were 7 of such outlets, however, today only one is functional. This outlet measures 160 x 90 centimeters and opens and closes like a drawer. The water flowing out of this outlet, after a path of approximately 12 kilometers, would eventually make its way to a valley called Baba Abbas. In the vicinity of this valley, and the location of the ancient city of Shapurkhast, the remnants of an old mill, which was run using water from the springs, can be observed.
Gerdab Sangi was registered on the National Heritage List in 1976.

=== Brick minaret ===
[[Brick Minaret]] is a 900-year-old brick tower located beside the ancient city of Shapur khawst, south of Khorramabad, Lorestan province. It was built as a guidepost for caravans in ancient times. The minaret is about 30 meters tall with a circumference of 17.5 meters. Inside the tower there is a spiral staircase of 99 stairs.

=== Inscribed stone ===
In a stone-edged circle beside thundering Shari’ati St is an inscribed stone from around AD 1150, apparently setting out details of local grazing rights.

=== Shapoori bridge ===
[[File:(پل شکسته (پل شاپوری.jpg|thumbnail|[[Shapoori Bridge]]]]

[[Shapoori Bridge]] is located in southern KhorramAbad. It has been used to connect the western part of [[Lorestan]] ([[Tarhan District|Tarhan]]) to the east, and then on to Khoozestan province and Taysafun, the capital city of the Sassanian. The bridge is 312 meters long and 10.75 meters high. It has 28 arches and 27 piles. The area of each pile is 61 square meters, and the distance between the two piles is 7.5 meters. Five of its arches are intact; the others have been destroyed by natural factors. The arches of the bridge are made in the form of a wishbone. The piles and breakwaters of the bridge are in the form of six lateral lozenges made of stone. Probably the bridge also was used to distribute water. Materials of the bridge are river stones and stone chips in the arches and truncated stones in the piles. The bridge floor is paved in red block stones that have lost their square shape due to erosion. This attractive, huge bridge belongs to Sassanian era, and it is registered as number 1058 in the list of Iranian national monuments.

=== Akhoond Aboo house ===
[[Akhoond Aboo house]] is located in the west of Falak-ol-Aflak Castle, in Khorramabad.

=== Keeyow lake ===
[[Keeyow lake]]   is a natural lake located in the Northwest of Khorramabad. This lake spans a seven-hectare area and has a depth of 3 to 7 meters. There is an amusement park as well as other recreational facilities next to this lake. Keeyow lake, which is the only natural city lake in Iran, is a habitat for native and migratory Birds and Aquatic animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=دریاچه کیو خرم‌آباد تنها دریاچه طبیعی درون‌شهری ایران|url=http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/5543425/%D8%AF%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7%DA%86%D9%87-%DA%A9%DB%8C%D9%88-%D8%AE%D8%B1%D9%85-%D8%A2%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7%DA%86%D9%87-%D8%B7%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%B9%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%B1|publisher=Young Jouranalists Club|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Light painting, painting with light,''' '''light drawing''', or '''light art performance photography''' are terms that describe [[photography|photographic]] techniques of moving a light source while taking a [[long exposure]] photograph, either to illuminate a subject or space, or to shine light at the [[camera]] to 'draw', or by moving the camera itself during exposure of light sources. Practised since the 1880s, the technique is used for both scientific and artistic purposes, as well as in commercial photography.

== History ==

Light painting (also called light drawing) dates back to 1889 when [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] and [[Georges Demenÿ|Georges Demeny]] traced human motion in the first known light painting ''Pathological Walk From in Front''.&lt;ref name="lightphoto"&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://lightpaintingphotography.com/light-painting-history/ |website=Light Painting Photography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique was used in [[Frank Gilbreth]]'s work with his wife [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] in 1914, when the pair used small lights and the open shutter of a camera to track the motion of manufacturing and clerical workers.

[[Man Ray]], in his 1935 series "Space Writing," was the first known art photographer to use the technique. He made a self-portrait with a time exposure and while the shutter was open, with a penlight he inscribed his name in cursive script in the space between him and the camera, overwriting the letters with more cryptic marks.&lt;ref&gt;Foresta, M. (1991). Tracing the Line: Art and Photography in the Age of Contact. Aperture (Archive : 1952-2005) (125), 16-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Anne Collins Goodyear | author2=Jonathan Frederick Walz | author3=Kathleen Merrill Campagnolo |others=Contribution by Dorinda Evans | title=This is a portrait if I say so : identity in American art, 1912 to today | publication-date=2016 | publisher=[[Bowdoin College Museum of Art]] in association with [[Yale University Press]] | oclc=989165304 | isbn=978-0-300-21193-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of photography Ellen Carey (*1952) describes her discovery of the artist's signature in this image while examining it in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Carey |first=Ellen |date=Fall 2011 |title=At Play With Man Ray |url=http://www.ellencareyphotography.com/pictus-writ-man-ray/ |magazine=Aperture |issue=204 |page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pure Energy and Neurotic Man 1940.jpg|thumb|right|''Pure Energy and Neurotic Man,'' a light painting by [[Barbara Morgan (photographer)|Barbara Morgan]] (1940)]]
Photographer [[Barbara Morgan (photographer)|Barbara Morgan]] began making light paintings in 1935-1941.&lt;ref&gt;Franks, Elizabeth Ellen. “Capturing Motion: A Catalog Raisonné of the Photomontage Works of Barbara Morgan 1935-1980.” MA Thesis, University of California Riverside, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Her 1941 photomontage ''Pure Energy and Neurotic Man'' incorporates light drawing and realises her stated aim; "that if I should ever seriously photograph, it would be...the flux of things. I wanted then, and still do, to express the ‘thing’ as part of total flow."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Barbara, and Marianne F. Margolis. Barbara Morgan: Photomontage. Dobbs Ferry, N.Y: Morgan &amp; Morgan, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; In making innovative photographs of dancers, including [[Martha Graham]] and [[Erick Hawkins]] she would have them move while holding lights.

In 1949 [[Pablo Picasso]] was visited by [[Gjon Mili]], a photographer and lighting innovator, who introduced Picasso to his photographs of ice skaters with lights attached to their skates.  Immediately Picasso started making images in the air with a small flashlight in a dark room.  This series of photos became known as Picasso's "light drawings."  Of these photos, the most celebrated and famous is known as ''Picasso draws a Centaur''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vpphotogallery.com/photog_mili_picasso.htm |title="Pablo Picasso" by Gjon Mili |publisher=VP Gallery |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126215646/http://www.vpphotogallery.com/photog_mili_picasso.htm |archivedate=2009-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Keetman (1916–2005), who studied photography in [[Munich]] from 1935 to 1937, was the 1949 co-founder of [[Fotoform|FotoForm]] (together with [[Otto Steinert]], Toni Schneiders et al.), a group with great impact on the new photography in the 50s and 60s in Germany and abroad. He produced a series ''Schwingungsfigur'' (oscillating figures) of complex linear meshes, often with moiré effects, using a point-source light on a pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Jäger, Gottfried | author2=Reese, Beate | author3=Krauss, Rolf H | title=Concrete photography = Konkrete fotografie | publication-date=2005 | publisher=Kerber Verlag | isbn=978-3-936646-74-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 80's [[Eric Staller]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ericstaller.com/studio%20work/light%20drawings/ Eric Staller - Light Drawings]&lt;/ref&gt; used this technology for numerous photo projects that were called "Light Drawings". Light paintings up to 1976 are classified as light drawings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 1977 [[Dean Chamberlain]] extended the technique using handheld lights to selectively illuminate and/or colour parts of the subject or scene with his image ''Polyethylene Bags On Chaise Longue'' at The [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]. Dean Chamberlain was the first artist to dedicate his entire body of work to the light painting art form.&lt;ref name="lightphoto" /&gt; The artist photographer [[Jacques Pugin]] made several series of images with the light drawing technique in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lpwalliance.com/index2.php?type=publicationview&amp;id=41 |title=Light Painting Historical Catalogue (part two) |website=[[Light Painting World Alliance]] (LPWA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, with modern light painting, one uses more frequently choreography and performance to photograph and organize.

Since the 1980s, [[Vicki DaSilva]] has been working exclusively in light painting and light graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McRee |first=Claire |date=2016 |title=Allentown X7 Photographic Explorations |publisher=Allentown Art Museum of the Lehigh Valley |chapter=The Multivalent Subject: Photographic Approaches to Allentown |isbn=978-1-882011-65-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, DaSilva&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vickidasilva.com/ Vicki DaSilva]&lt;/ref&gt; started making deliberate text light graffiti works, the first being "Cash".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vickidasilva.com/light-gra/ Vicki DaSilva - Light Graffiti]&lt;/ref&gt; She continued these light graffiti photographs throughout the 1980s and eventually started using 4 foot fluorescent bulbs hooked up to pulley systems to create sheets of light. In the early 2000s she began making work with 8 foot fluorescent lamps, holding the lamp vertically and walking through spaces with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vickidasilva.com/interiors/ Vicki DaSilva - Light Painting - Interiors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vickidasilva.com/exteriors/ Vicki DaSilva - Light Painting - Exteriors]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1980s [[Tokihiro Satō]]'s photographs combine light, time and space in recording his movements in a series beginning with his “photo respirations” where his use of an 8 x 10-inch [[view camera]] fitted with a strong [[neutral-density filter]] to achieve lengthy exposures lasting one to three hours provide the opportunity for him to move through the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1=Satō, Tokihiro | author2=Siegel, Elizabeth | title=Photo respiration : Tokihiro Sato photographs | publication-date=2005 | publisher=Art Institute of Chicago | location=Chicago | edition= 1st | oclc=718345388 | isbn=978-0-86559-217-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When shooting in daylight, with a mirror he flashed light from the sun into the camera lens, resulting in points of light and flares that punctuate the image and track his movements, though his presence is not seen directly. For nocturnal or interior views he “draws” with a small torch.

Light painting as an artform enjoyed a surge in popularity in the 21st century, partly due to the increasing availability of [[dSLR]] cameras and [[Camera phone|mobile phone cameras]] enabling immediate feedback for adjustments of lights and exposure; advances in portable light sources such as LEDs; and the advent of media sharing websites by which practitioners can exchange images and ideas.

In March 2007, [[JanLeonardo]] coined the term ''light art performance photography (LAPP)''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;JanLeonardo Woellert &amp; Joerg Miedza - Faszination Lichtmalerei: Die Kunst der Light Art Performance Photography, 09/2010, dpunkt Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-89864-669-7}} (German)&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasises the performative aspect that is evident earlier in [[Tokihiro Satō|Satō]]'s work,&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (2016). IN TERMS OF ART. Art and AsiaPacific (100), 98-109.&lt;/ref&gt; and used it to describe the creation of new figures and structures only with light. Following the original [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] meaning of [[Photography]] (Greek φῶς, phos, genetive: φωτός, photos, "light" (of the luminary), "brightness" and γράφειν, graphein, "drawing", "carve", "create", "write") it is a [[symbiosis]] of [[light art]] and photography. The main difference from other ''light painting'' or ''light writing'', it has been claimed,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is the role of the background in the photo.{{Clarify|clarification needed=|date=July 2018}} Locations in the natural landscape or amongst buildings, such as industrial ruins, are carefully researched for distinctive backgrounds for each composition and [[LED]]-lamps are often used for contrasting cold and warm light to emphasise the existing structures. Collaboration is usually required in the performance of the work, with one person creating light figures and structures while the other operates the camera. In collaboration with Jörg Miedza, JanLeonardo founded the project LAPP-PRO.de that further developed the technique until in 2011, the pair disassociated. LAPP has grown internationally since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview |url=http://cpn.canon-europe.com/content/interviews/light_art_performance_photography.do |date=February 2009 |website=Canon Professionell Network |publisher=Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

[[File:Light painting screw.jpg|thumb|right|''Light Painting Screw'', by Karsten Knöfler]]
Light painting using handheld lights to selectively illuminate or colour parts of the subject or scene or to evenly light large architectural interiors has been used in professional photography since the 1930s as described by Leslie Walker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Walker, Leslie C | title=The technique of painting with light | publication-date=1940 | publisher=The Nash-Jones publishing company | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/32824743 | accessdate=17 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ansel Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Adams, Ansel | author2=Baker, Robert | publisher=New York Graphic Society | title=The negative | publication-date=1981 | edition= 1st | page= 174| isbn=978-0-8212-1131-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Light painting requires a slow [[shutter speed]], usually at least a second in duration. Light painting can imitate characteristics of traditional painting; superimposition and transparency can easily be achieved by moving, adding or removing lights or subjects during or between exposures.

Projector light painting, by waving a white translucent flash diffuser in the light path of a portable projector, the continuous motion creates a invisible screen in air for the projected image in the photo.

Light paintings can be created using a [[webcam]].{{Clarify|clarification needed=|date=March 2016}} The painted image can already be seen while drawing by using a monitor or projector. Another technique is the projection of images on to irregular surfaces (such as faces or buildings), in effect "painting" them with light.  A photograph or other fixed portrayal of the resulting image is then made.

Kinetic light painting is achieved by moving the camera, and is the antithesis of traditional photography. At night, or in a dark room, the camera can be removed from the tripod and used like a [[paintbrush]]. An example is using the night sky as the canvas, the camera as the brush and artificially-lit cityscapes as the palette. Putting energy into moving the camera by stroking lights,{{clarify|date=October 2014}} making patterns and laying down backgrounds can create abstract artistic images.

A variety of light sources can be used, ranging from simple [[flashlight]]s to dedicated devices like the Hosemaster, which uses a [[fiber optic]] light pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://photo.net/learn/studio/primer | title=Studio Photography | first=Philip | last=Greenspun | date=January 2007 | publisher=Photo.net | accessdate=2007-09-26 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104533/http://photo.net/learn/studio/primer | archivedate=2007-09-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of light including candles, matches, fireworks, lighter flints, [[glowsticks]], and [[Poi (juggling)|poi]] are also popular.

A [[tripod (photography)|tripod]] is usually necessary due to the long exposure times involved. Alternatively, the camera may be placed on or braced against a table or other solid support. A [[Bulb (photography)|shutter release cable]] or [[self timer]] is generally employed in order to minimize camera shake. [[Color gel]]s can also be used to color the light sources.

Some light painters make their own dedicated devices to create light trails over the photo background; this can include computer-controlled devices like the Pixelstick. These devices are often Arduino-controlled LED arrays that can render images that could not be made by drawing in the air with a single light source alone. LED lights, [[Luminescence|luminescent]] materials, [[pyrotechnics]], [[fireworks]] and [[flashlight]]s are also used.

The city of [[Liverpool]] has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from [[City of Westminster|Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Britain: Liverpool |publisher=HistoricBritain.com |url=http://www.historicbritain.com/results.aspx?showmessage=true&amp;location=liverpool&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples include works by [[George Frampton]], [[Goscombe John]], [[Thomas Thornycroft]], [[Charles Bell Birch]], [[Richard Westmacott]], [[Francis Chantrey]], [[John Gibson (sculptor)|John Gibson]], [[Thomas Brock]] and [[F.W. Pomeroy]], while [[Barbara Hepworth]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Mitzi Cunliffe]] and [[Elizabeth Frink]] provide some of the modern offerings. More recently, local artist [[Tom Murphy (artist)|Tom Murphy]] has created a dozen sculptures in Liverpool.

While statues and sculpture are dotted throughout the inner city, there are four primary groupings: inside and around [[St George's Hall, Liverpool|St George's Hall]]; in [[St John's Gardens]];&lt;ref&gt;dubbed "Liverpool's alfresco [[Valhalla]]", every statue inside is listed, together with the walls and gatepiers&lt;/ref&gt; around the [[Pier Head]]; and around the Palm House at [[Sefton Park]]. Smaller groups are found in Old Hall Street/Exchange Flags and in and around [[The Oratory]].

The ''[[Victoria Monument (Liverpool)|Queen Victoria Monument]]'' at Derby Square, an ensemble of 26 bronze figures by [[C. J. Allen (sculptor)|C. J. Allen]], is described in the Liverpool ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guide]]'' as one of the most ambitious British monuments to the Queen.&lt;ref name=Pevsner&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sharples |first1=Joseph |last2=Pollard |first2=Richard |title=Liverpool |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZQLDM9oekgC&amp;pg=PA149 |accessdate=February 4, 2013 |year=2004 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0300102581 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Little Britain Live''''' is a stage show based on the TV sketch series ''[[Little Britain]]'', performed by its stars, [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] and [[David Walliams]], and directed by [[Jeremy Sams]]. Supporting characters are played by [[Paul Putner]] and Samantha Power (with [[Anthony Head]] and [[Ruth Jones]] in certain performances). As in the TV show, [[Tom Baker]] is the narrator, although his lines are pre-recorded. The show toured the United Kingdom from October 2005 until December 2006, and Australia from January–March 2007.

==Development==
In an interview in the show's program, Lucas and Walliams state that they had always wanted ''Little Britain'' to be a radio programme, a television series and live stage show.

After production of the third series of the television show, the duo settled down to write and plan the show. In rehearsals, the sketches were tweaked, re-ordered and re-written in order to accommodate the rapid costume and make-up changes required by the principal performers. To remove the need for stagehands to make set and prop changes, an elaborate stage floor was designed with track lines for the props. Sets were projected onto the background of the stage, with computer animated transitions designed by video and lighting designer [[Willie Williams (lighting designer)|Willie Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;''Little Britain Live'' programme&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain sketches required elaborate technical mechanisms, such as the vomit machine for the Judy and Maggie "Village Fete" sketch, and oversized props for the [[Dennis Waterman (Little Britain)|Dennis Waterman]] sketch.

During the show's UK run, several sketches were rewritten to improve the pacing, or removed in cases where the sketch was the same as the TV series.

==Performances==
The show's run began at the [[Portsmouth Guildhall]] in [[Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]] on 23 October 2005. The show toured for 49 performances in 18 cities: [[Bournemouth]], [[Southend]], [[Plymouth]], [[Sheffield]], [[Manchester]], [[Nottingham]], [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Liverpool]], [[Oxford]], [[Bristol]], [[Ipswich]], [[Birmingham]], [[Blackpool]], [[Brighton]] and ending in [[Manchester]] on 20 December.

Lucas and Walliams took a month off, before resuming the UK tour and returning to the previously-toured cities. A month-long residency at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] in London in October and November 2006 followed, with two shows at the [[Brixton Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidwalliams.com/LittleBritainTour2005.htm Little Britain Tour 2005], DavidWalliams.com.&lt;/ref&gt; There were 3 live shows in Ireland during the summer of 2006, shown at the [[Point Theatre]] in Dublin. The show was eventually seen by nearly one million people on its UK tour from November 2005 to December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article2114991.ece Matt Lucas: Littler Britain], ''[[The Independent]]'', 1 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Little Britain Live'' toured Australia in early 2007. Initial bookings were made in Sydney, with other cities added as ticket sales soared. Eventually the show sold out six performances in [[Melbourne]] and [[Brisbane]], seven in [[Sydney]] and [[Perth]], and two in [[Adelaide]]. Performances were also held in [[Canberra]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]].

The show also featured cameo appearances from [[Russell Brand]], [[Patsy Kensit]], [[Kate Thornton]] and DJ [[Chris Moyles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6175608.stm Model Moss joins Little Britain], ''[[BBC News]]'', 23 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sketches are adjusted to reflect local content, such as the locality referred to as a 'shithole' by travel agent Carol Beer ([[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in Blackpool, [[Bolton]] in Manchester,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.littlebritainonline.com/?go=tourreview Little Britain Live tour review], Little Britain Online, 12 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolverhampton]] or [[Chelmsley Wood]] in Birmingham,  [[Derby]] in Nottingham, [[Strabane]] in Belfast, Shepherd's Bush in London, [[Broadmeadows, Victoria|Broadmeadows]] in Melbourne, [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]] in Adelaide, [[Balga, Western Australia|Balga]] in Perth, [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in Brisbane, [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] in [[Tyne and Wear]], [[Dapto, New South Wales|Dapto]] in Wollongong and [[Charnwood, Australian Capital Territory|Charnwood]] in Canberra), or retail outlets frequented by Vicky Pollard. In Australia, Lucas and Walliams were assisted by local comedians such as [[Gina Riley]] and [[Jane Turner]] (creators of ''[[Kath &amp; Kim (Australian TV series)|Kath &amp; Kim]]'') for Melbourne references and [[Andrew Denton]] for Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Cameron: [http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21145425-2902,00.html Look at moi, Britain], ''[[Herald Sun]]'', 31 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lorna Cartwright''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Janet Dibley]] intermittently between 31 July 1997 and 23 April 1998.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://iccoventry.icnetwork.co.uk/whatson/entertainments/tm_headline=janet-has-a-head-for-dark-humour&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=19977191&amp;siteid=50003-name_page.html Janet has a head for dark humour]", ''Coventry Telegraph ''. . Retrieved 2007-11-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorna was introduced primarily as a catalyst to break up [[Phil Mitchell]]'s ([[Steve McFadden]]) marriage to [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]). Although producers reportedly wanted to develop the character further, actress Janet Dibley declined their offer of an extended contract, as she disagreed with a proposed storyline that would see Lorna [[gang rape]]d. The character returned on 17 March 2016, as part of Phil's [[cirrhosis]] storyline&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07471cq&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
Lorna is an alcoholic who [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) meets at his AA meetings. She bumps into Phil at a café one afternoon and is openly attracted to him. Phil, whose marriage is suffering due to his alcoholism, finds a kindred spirit in Lorna. She understands his struggles with addiction in a way that his wife can not. When Lorna invites Phil back to her place, she is shocked to discover that he is married, as in her experience, alcoholism destroys marriages - her alcoholism had destroyed hers and her ex-husband was awarded custody of their children after she went to court, drunk. However, Lorna is not perturbed, and the following meeting, she invites Phil back to her place again; he cannot resist her advances and they have sex.

Phil is plagued with guilt, he tries several times to end his affair with Lorna, but he cannot and always ends up having sex with her again. However, Lorna begins expecting more than he is prepared to give. He ends their affair when she starts coming to his home in [[Albert Square]] but this infuriates Lorna. She phones Phil's house and makes herself known to his wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]). With Kathy's suspicions raised, Phil concocts a story that Lorna is an obsessive alcoholic, who has merely taken his rejection badly. However, when Phil goes to Paris, he is given a hand-written suicidal letter from Lorna, ridiculing his skills in bed. Kathy demands to know what is in the letter, leaving Phil no choice but to admit to the affair. Kathy's response is to throw her wedding ring in the River Seine, telling Phil that marrying him is the worst mistake of her life.

Lorna arrives drunk and homeless at The Reverend [[Alex Healy (EastEnders)|Alex Healy]]'s (Richard Driscoll) refuge centre, Bridge House. Lorna's suicidal threats cause concern in good samaritan [[Sarah Hills]] ([[Daniela Denby-Ashe]]), but she cannot cope with Lorna's constant binge drinking. Sarah seeks help from her Aunt Kathy, Phil's estranged wife. Kathy, a former [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritan]], tries talking some sense into Lorna, unaware that she is talking to the woman who caused the breakdown of her marriage. After listening to Lorna's tales of woe, Kathy realises the truth and exploded at Lorna for breaking up her family. Lorna is incensed to discover that, even after Kathy dumped him, Phil did not want her. Phil struggles to cope with Lorna's suicidal threats but Kathy is more supportive. She visits Lorna and is told that she has turned to prostitution, and when Lorna is assaulted — allegedly by a client — Kathy allows her to move in with her to recuperate. Phil is furious.

Lorna makes various attempts to reignite her affair with Phil, hampering any reconciliation between him and Kathy. When Lorna discovers that Kathy is planning to emigrate to South Africa, she immediately tells Phil, just to cause trouble between them. Kathy turns on her, and following rejection from Phil, Lorna decides to take her own life by swallowing a cocktail of pills and gin in Phil's bathroom. Phil breaks the door down and calls an ambulance, stalling his attempt to win Kathy back. She leaves for South Africa before Phil has a chance to persuade her to stay. Lorna survives her suicide attempt and with the help of Rev. Healy, she admits herself into a detox programme.

Eighteen years later, Phil is surprised to meet Lorna at an alcoholic support group and asks her to leave. When she reveals she is leading the session, he leaves, despite her claims she wants to help him like he helped her many years ago. A few weeks later, Phil goes to the support group with the persuasion and support of his daughter, [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]). Lorna allows Phil into the group when he says he wants to stop drinking.

==Character creation and development==
Lorna Cartwright was introduced in July 1997 under Series Producer [[Jane Harris (director)|Jane Harris]]. Yorkshire actress [[Janet Dibley]] was cast in the role, previously known for her starring role opposite [[Nicholas Lyndhurst]] in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] sitcom ''[[The Two of Us (1986 TV series)|The Two of Us]]''.

Lorna, described as "a drunken loner", was part of a storyline that centred on the character [[Phil Mitchell]] (Steve McFadden) and his ongoing struggles with [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name="lorna"&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/07_july/12/chase_cast3.shtml The Chase]", "BBC" . . Retrieved 2007-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt; A fellow alcoholic, Lorna met Phil at an [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meeting and "became attached to him"; they began a torrid affair, which ended badly.&lt;ref name="lorna"/&gt;  Lorna’s principal purpose was to break up the marriage of Phil and his wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] (Gillian Taylforth), which eventually happened in a special set of episodes, that was broadcast in August 1997 and was filmed in Paris, France. A critic for ''[[The Independent]]'' commented on the Paris episodes: "Phil is jumpy because he expects Lorna to emerge shrieking from the bushes at any moment; stabbing wildly about her with a carving knife (she gave a tiny clue to her highly strung nature the other night, by stubbing a cigarette out on his chest). He was so nervous, indeed, that he eventually confessed his infidelity to Kathy. If he thought that this was going to buy him a quiet few days of remorse and mutual weeping, he was wrong. The wedding ring went straight in the [[Seine]] in the middle of a blazing soap aria from [[Gillian Taylforth]]." &lt;ref&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970828/ai_n14119830 Television review]", ''The Independent''. . Retrieved 2007-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

After being absent from August 1997, Lorna reappeared once again in February 1998. Lorna was involved in the storyline that saw the character Kathy depart the serial after 13 years; her suicide bid helped to ruin Phil and Kathy's chance of patching up their marriage, and Kathy left for a new life in South Africa. Following the climax of this storyline, Lorna departed. The producers of ''EastEnders'' had wanted to keep the character in the show, but Janet Dibley reportedly turned down the BBC's £130,000 pay offer after discovering they were planning to turn Lorna into a prostitute who was to be gang-raped.&lt;ref name="dibley"&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19980301/ai_n14473732 EASTENDER QUITS OVER GANG RAPE]", ''Sunday Mirror''. . Retrieved 2007-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

It would have been the first time the soap had shown such an attack, but Dibley feared the "harrowing scenes" would lead to her six-year-old son being taunted.&lt;ref name="dibley"/&gt;  She reportedly commented, "It just doesn't feel right. I don't care how much money is on offer. I can't do those scenes…I am terrified about how it might affect [my son]. I don't want him getting taunted at school." &lt;ref name="dibley2"&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19980301/ai_n144737I can't do those scenes ... I don't want my son taunted at school]", ''Sunday Mirror''. . Retrieved 2007-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Dibley allegedly heard about Lorna’s intended storyline from rumours on set, and approached series producer [[Mike Hudson (producer)|Mike Hudson]] to talk it through. After several meetings, Dibley told Hudson she was unsatisfied with the storyline and refused to sign a new contract. The producers were reportedly upset over her decision, "because they saw Janet becoming one of the most important stars of the show." The scripts were subsequently re-written and Lorna made her final appearance in April 1998.&lt;ref name="dibley2"/&gt;

Dibley’s decision was supported by MPs and women’s groups, who condemned the BBC for planning to screen gang rape scenes, which would have been shown 90 minutes before the 9&amp;nbsp;pm watershed. Philippa Chipping, of the Domestic Violence Intervention Project, said the storyline was irresponsible: "I completely understand Janet's fear of playing what would be a very traumatic scene. ''EastEnders'' would not be able to give a sensible and responsible handling of the issue." A counsellor at the London Rape Crisis centre added: "The scriptwriters are using the traumatic experience that many women have gone through just to increase their ratings. They should speak to victims before doing something like this. Janet deserves full credit for the stand she has taken."  Tory MP [[Ann Widdecombe]] also praised Dibley’s decision: "Well done to her. It's high time somebody took a stand. ''EastEnders'' is watched by an awful lot of children and something like this should not be shown." Labour MP [[Ronnie Campbell]] added, "to show a gang-rape in a soap opera is entirely wrong. I am pleased that this actress has taken a stand. It is a very bold move." [[Mary Whitehouse]], of the [[National Viewers' and Listeners' Association]], said: "I think her actions are very commendable. It's splendid that she has turned down the offer of more money to stand by her principles. There is far too much sex and violence screened on TV when children are watching." Conservative MP [[Teddy Taylor]] said, "Janet will lose a great deal of money by the action she has taken, but she will gain a great deal in helping to improve standards in British broadcasting."&lt;ref name="dibley3"&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19980301/ai_n14473724/pg_2 'YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING']", ''Sunday Mirror''. . Retrieved  2007-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dibley also received praise from the media. Pam Francis of the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' commented, "If it were not for the fact that Janet Dibley plays such a tragic alcoholic in ''EastEnders'', I'd send her a bottle of bubbly to toast her protest.  It takes a brave performer to fight for what she believes in, particularly a single mother like Janet who is sacrificing a lucrative contract. But you can't put a price on the damage caused by exposing young viewers to brutal scenes. It is known that children as young as Janet's son Bobby, six, tune in to the soap…. By standing her ground, Janet Dibley is giving what I consider the performance of a lifetime."&lt;ref name="dibley6"&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19980301/ai_n14473723 JANET SACRIFICES CASH FOR PERFORMANCE OF A LIFETIME]", ''Sunday Mirror''. . Retrieved 2007-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  While Dibley was praised, ''EastEnders'' was heavily criticised in the media for planning the storyline. One reporter questioned the competency of the programme makers, saying, "Are producers of ''EastEnders'' so unimaginative that they couldn't think of a future for Janet's character Lorna other than turn her into the tart…" Another accused the show’s producers of being prepared to expose "children to scenes of violence and sex, which are both gratuitous and offensive", merely to bring in higher ratings, and beat their biggest soap rival, ''[[Coronation Street]]''.&lt;ref name="dibley4"&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19980301/ai_n14473749 Leader: Shameful TV soap scenes our children mustn't see]", "Sunday Mirror". . Retrieved 2007-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  John Blunt, from the ''[[Lancashire Evening Telegraph]]'', accused the gang rape storyline of being the latest novelty wretchedness to be gratuitously used by soap scriptwriters "in the name of family entertainment". He criticised the UK broadcasting watchdog’s efficiency at protecting young children who routinely watch soap operas, commenting:  "Short of parents having the good sense to turn the TV off and spare their children from exposure to such coarse assaults on their innocence, a much firmer line needs to be taken by our broadcasting standards watchdogs - whose evident ineffectiveness is brought home by Janet Dibley showing what ought to be done in the name of common decency and family values."&lt;ref name="dibley5"&gt;"[http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/1998/3/4/806609.html Blunder-land!]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}", " thisislancashire.co.uk " . . Retrieved 2007-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the controversy surrounding her departure, actress Janet Dibley has since been complimentary about her role in ''EastEnders''. In 2006 she commented, "It was a great part…[Lorna] wreaked havoc and left."&lt;ref name="lorna"/&gt;

The '''''Manuel de civilité pour les petites filles à l'usage des maisons d'éducation''''' (English: ''Handbook of behaviour for little girls to be used in educational establishments'')&lt;ref&gt;There is no punctuation in the French title and therefore not in the English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;tr. Sabine D’Estrée, ''A Handbook...''&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[erotic literature|erotic literary work]] by the French writer [[Pierre Louÿs]], written in 1917 and published posthumously and anonymously in 1927.

It takes the form of a parody of the rigorous educational handbooks of the time, and is thus composed of short pieces of advice (generally a sentence or two) arranged into topics: "At home", "Duties towards your mother", "In class", etc. The tone of the work is sharp, even concise, the style particularly believable and chatty. Pierre Louÿs uses irony readily to evoke the cheap loves of the perverse young girls, and this relative distance enables him to despise any moral censure ([[incest]], [[paedophilia]]...). In fact, one is far from the invaluable refinement of the ''[[Songs of Bilitis]]'' for example.  The ''Handbook of civility'' is undoubtedly the most [[subversive]] work of Louÿs, a true attack against the middle-class [[Religious fanaticism|puritanism]] of the [[Belle Époque]].

By the way of illustration, the "[[Glossary]]" which opens the work comprises this warning:&lt;blockquote&gt;We have considered it useless to explain the words: [[cunt]], slit, [[wikt:fanny|fanny]], mound, [[penis|cock]], tail, [[bollock]], [[testicle]], [[orgasm|cum]] (verb), [[semen|cum]] (noun), [[erection]], [[masturbate]], suck, [[licking|lick]], [[pump]], [[kiss]], [[fellate]], [[screw]], [[fuck]], [[Anal sex|ass-fuck]], [[ejaculate]], [[dildo]], [[lesbian]], [[dyke (slang)|dyke]], [[69 (sex position)|sixty-nine]], [[cunnilingus]], [[cuteness|cute]], [[whore]], [[brothel]]. These words are familiar to all little girls.&lt;ref&gt;French: ''Nous avons jugé inutile d'expliquer les mots : con, fente, moniche, motte, pine, queue, bitte, couille, foutre (verbe), foutre (subst.), bander, branler, sucer, lécher, pomper, baiser, piner, enfiler, enconner, enculer, décharger, godmiché, gougnotte, gousse, soixante-neuf, minette, mimi, putain, bordel. Ces mots-là sont familiers à toutes les petites filles.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The edition of the work published at Librio is marked "for informed readers". Some of the book’s counsels were illustrated by cartoonist [[Loïc Dubigeon]] under the title of ''Handbook of behaviour for the use of "big" girls''.

'''''Marid''''' ({{lang-ar|مارد}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|mārid}}'') is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word meaning ''rebellious'', which is sometimes applied to supernatural beings.

==In Arabic sources ==

The word ''mārid'' is an [[Participle|active participle]] of the root ''m-r-d'' (مرد), whose primary meaning is ''recalcitrant, rebellious''. ''Lisān al-`arab'', the encyclopedic dictionary of classical Arabic compiled by [[Ibn Manzur]], reports only forms of this general meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alwaraq.net/Core/AlwaraqSrv/bookpage?book=89&amp;fkey=2&amp;page=5376&amp;option=1 |author=Ibn Manzur |title=Lisan al-`arab (entry for m-r-d) |page=5376}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found as an attribute of evil spirits in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] (aṣ-Ṣāffāt, 37:7), which speaks of a "safeguard against every rebellious devil" (شَيْطَانٍ مَارِدٍ, ''shaitān mārid'').

The [[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic|Wehr-Cowan dictionary]] of modern written Arabic also gives secondary meanings of ''demon'' and ''giant''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |first1=Hans |last1=Wehr |first2=J.M. |last2=Cowan |title=A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic |edition=3rd |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |publisher=Spoken Language Services |page=903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane's ''[[Arabic-English Lexicon]]'' cites a source where it "''is said to be applied to an evil jinnee of the most powerful class''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/lane/ |title=An Arabic-English Lexicon: Derived from the best and the most copious Eastern sources |first=Edward William |last=Lane |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408021742/http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/lane/ |archivedate=2015-04-08 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this distinction is not universal. For example, in the standard MacNaghten edition of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' one finds the words ''marid'' and ''[[ifrit]]'' used interchangeably (e.g., in ''The Story of the Fisherman'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/aliflailaorbook03unkngoog |title=Alif Laila |editor-first=Sir William Hay |editor-last=Mac Naghten |location=Calcutta |publisher=W. Thacker and Co |year=1839 |volume=1 |page=20 |language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mārid is explicitly mentioned in [[Sirat Sayf ibn Dhi-Yazan]]. Accordingly [[Sayf ibn Dhi-Yazan|Sayf]] demands from the marid to lead him to [[Solomon in Islam|Solomon]]s hoard. But following his nature, the demon does the exact oppisite of that he was commanded. Later he learned from [[Khidr]], he must command the opposite of that he desires him to do.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam Walter'' de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 100 (German) &lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern fantasy genres ==
In Jonathan Stroud's ''[[Bartimaeus Sequence]]'' novel series, marids are the most powerful type of demons summoned by magicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jonathan |last=Stroud |title=The Amulet of Samarkand |series=The Bartimaeus Trilogy, Book&amp;nbsp;1 |publisher=Disney-Hyperion |edition=Reprint |year=2004 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' tabletop game, [[Marid (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|marids]] are genies from the Elemental Plane of Water.

'''Marina Roy''' is a visual artist, educator and writer based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].

==Life==
Roy was born in Quebec, and moved to Vancouver in her youth.  She obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in French Literature at [[Université Laval]], a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|B.F.A.]] from the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]], and an [[Masters of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] from the [[University of British Columbia]].  She has shown nationally and internationally, including the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]], the [[Contemporary Art Gallery (Vancouver)|Contemporary Art Gallery]], [[Centre A]], Malaspina, and [[Or Gallery]]. She is an Associate Professor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=University of British Columbia|first1=Department of Art History, Visual Art and Theory|url=http://www.ahva.ubc.ca/facultyIntroDisplay.cfm?InstrID=15&amp;FacultyID=2|title=Marina Roy|access-date=2015-03-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402162949/http://www.ahva.ubc.ca/facultyIntroDisplay.cfm?InstrID=15&amp;FacultyID=2#|archive-date=2015-04-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of British Columbia, Department of Art History, Visual Art and Theory.

== Artistic practice ==
Roy's practice is cross disciplinary, with a focus on drawing, painting and animation.  Her work investigates material intelligence in a post-humanist perspective. The evolution of her practice draws upon [[Sigmond Freud|Freud]] and [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]], demonstrating modes of fantasy, eroticism, and compulsion by way of changed symbols and recognized icons. The Canadian artist's use of cartoons also aligns her with the domain of the death drive: According to [[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek]], characters like [[Wile E. Coyote]] occupy a libidinal space where one can live through any catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomic|first1=Milena|title=Everyday Every Other Day|journal=Border Crossings|date=2006|volume=25|issue=4|pages=107–08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Marsh with Water Lilies''}}
'''''Marsh with Water Lilies''''' is a drawing by [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It was executed at Etten (now [[Etten-Leur]]) in June 1881.

Vincent's father Theodorus van Gogh, a pastor, was called to Etten in 1875. Vincent spent periods of time there, notably from Easter to Christmas 1881 when he returned to join his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], an art dealer, determined to become an artist. This period at Etten represents the beginning proper of Vincent's ten-year career as an artist. He had drawn since boyhood, and the previous year had enrolled in a beginners' class in Brussels where he met the painter [[Anthon van Rappard]], but he now began to draw in earnest. He rapidly developed an accomplished technique in landscape drawing but remained rather more uncertain in his figure drawing, which he practiced assiduously with the aid of [[Charles Bargue]]'s drawing course.&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker pp. 13-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Rappard made a twelve-day visit during this time, and they sketched together in the marshes and heaths round Etten. Vincent also visited his cousin-in-law [[Anton Mauve]] in [[The Hague]], a celebrated artist of the time, who had expressed an interest in his drawings and who encouraged him  further. At this time Vincent had not progressed as far as painting, though he did wash some of his drawings with watercolor. At the end of the year he made an extended visit to Mauve, who introduced him to painting. He returned to Etten with the intention of setting up a studio there. However he quarreled with his father on Christmas Day and left the family home to set up his studio in [[The Hague]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Naifeh and White Smith pp. 230-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The drawing was in the holdings of Vincent's sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]] who left Etten in June 1881 to take up a position as a governess in Amsterdam. At the same time there is a mention in a letter to Theo of Vincent making a pen drawing in the Passievaart marshes of lilies during an excursion with Anthon van Rappard, who was visiting. It is reasonable to suppose he gave this drawing as a leaving gift to Wil, thus  dating the drawing as around 13 June 1881 from van Rappard's own date for his Passievaart drawing.&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group= "Letters"&gt;{{cite web|title= Letter 168 to Theo van Gogh. Etten, end of June 1881|url= http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let168/letter.html|work= Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|at= 1r:1|quote= I must tell you that Rappard was here for 12 days or so, and has now left. Naturally he sends you his regards.&lt;br&gt;We went on a fair number of excursions together, several times to the heath at Seppe, among other places, and the so-called Passievaart, a huge marsh. There Rappard painted a large study (1 metre x 50 cm), much of which was good. Incidentally, he made around 10 small sepias, also in the Liesbos.&lt;br&gt;While he was painting I made a pen drawing of another spot in the marsh where many water lilies grow.

[[Image:A New Earth Webcast, 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Eckhart Tolle joins Oprah to discuss his book ''A New Earth'' as part of a live webcast series on Oprah.com]]
'''Oprah's Book Club''' was a [[book discussion club]] segment of the [[United States|American]] [[talk show]] ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', highlighting books chosen by host [[Oprah Winfrey]]. Winfrey started the book club in 1996, selecting a new book, usually a [[novel]], for viewers to read and discuss each month.&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt; The club ended its 15-year run, along with the ''Oprah Winfrey Show'', on May 25, 2011.&lt;ref name=minzesheimer&gt;Bob Minzesheimer, [https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2011-05-22-Oprah-Winfrey-Book-Club_n.htm "How the 'Oprah Effect' changed publishing"], ''USA Today'', May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flamm&gt;Matthew Flamm, [http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110520/FREE/110529985/1072 "Publishers say farewell to Oprah Book Club boon"], ''Crain's New York Business'', May 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kellogg/&gt; In total the club recommended 70 books during its 15 years.

Due to the book club's widespread popularity, many obscure titles have become very popular [[bestseller]]s, increasing sales in some cases by as many as several million copies.&lt;ref name="oprah effect"&gt;{{cite news | last =Wyatt | first =Edward | coauthors = | title = Tolstoy's Translators Experience Oprah's Effect | work = | pages = | newspaper =The New York Times | date =June 7, 2004 | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E6D81131F934A35755C0A9629C8B63 | accessdate =October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Greco, a Fordham University marketing professor, estimated the total sales of the 69 "Oprah editions" at over 55 million copies.&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt;

The club has seen several literary controversies, such as [[Jonathan Franzen]]'s public dissatisfaction with his novel ''[[The Corrections]]'' having been chosen by Winfrey,&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt; and the now infamous incident of [[James Frey]]'s memoir, ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'', a 2005 selection, being outed as almost entirety fabricated.&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt; The latter controversy resulted in Frey and publisher [[Nan Talese]] being confronted and publicly shamed by Winfrey in a highly praised live televised episode of Winfrey's show.&lt;ref name="truthiness"&gt;{{cite news | last =Carr | first =David | coauthors = | title =How Oprahness Trumped Truthiness | work = | pages = | newspaper =The New York Times | date =January 30, 2006 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/business/media/30carr.html?ex=1296277200&amp;en=1c0e8843da5b43d6&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | accessdate =October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, June 1, 2012, Oprah announced the launch of [[Oprah's Book Club 2.0]] with ''Wild'' by [[Cheryl Strayed]]. The new version of Oprah's Book Club, a joint project between OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network and ''O: The Oprah Winfrey Magazine'', will incorporate the use of various social media platforms and e-readers.

==History==
The book club's first selection on September 17, 1996, was the then recently published novel ''[[The Deep End of the Ocean]]'' by [[Jacquelyn Mitchard]].&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt; Winfrey discontinued the book club for one year in 2002, stating that she could not keep up with the required reading while still searching for contemporary novels that she enjoyed.&lt;ref name="turns page"&gt;{{cite news | last =Lacayo | first =Richard | coauthors = | title =Oprah Turns the Page | pages = | work =Time Magazine | date =April 7, 2002 | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002228,00.html | accessdate =October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After its revival in 2003, books were selected on a more limited basis (three or four a year)

Winfrey returned to fiction with her 2007 selections of ''[[The Road]]'' by [[Cormac McCarthy]] in March and ''[[Middlesex (novel)|Middlesex]]'' by [[Jeffrey Eugenides]] in June.  Shortly after its being chosen, ''The Road'' was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]].  Winfrey conducted the first ever television interview with McCarthy, a famously reclusive author, on June 5, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahsbookclub/road/road_book_synopsis/1 |title=Readers' Guide to The Road by Cormac McCarthy |publisher=Oprah.com |date=March 28, 2007 |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2007, the latest selection was announced as ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'', a 1985 novel by Nobel Prize laureate [[Gabriel García Márquez]], greatly furthering not only the influence of the author in North America, but that of his translator [[Edith Grossman]].  Another work by Márquez, ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', was a previous selection for the book club in 2004.&lt;ref name="marquez"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Oprah Winfrey chooses Garcia Marquez's 'Love in the Time of Cholera' as next book club pick | work = | pages = | publisher =The International Herald Tribune | date =October 5, 2007 | url =http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/05/arts/NA-A-E-BKS-US-Winfreys-Book-Club.php | accessdate =October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last club selection was a special edition of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' and ''[[Great Expectations]]''.&lt;ref name=kellogg&gt;Carolyn Kellogg, [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/books/la-ca-oprah-books-20110522,0,193254.story "Oprah's Book Club: She spoke, we read"], ''Los Angeles Times'', May 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It had disappointingly low sales figures.&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt;

==Influence==
In ''Reading with Oprah: The Book Club That Changed America'', [[Kathleen Rooney]] describes Winfrey as "a serious American [[intellectual]] who pioneered the use of electronic media, specifically [[television]] and the [[Internet]], to take reading&amp;mdash;a decidedly non-technological and highly individual act&amp;mdash;and highlight its social elements and uses in such a way to motivate millions of erstwhile non-readers to pick up books."

''[[Business Week]]'' stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of the Oprah phenomenon is how outsized her power is compared with that of other market movers. Some observers suggest that [[Jon Stewart]] of [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]'' could be No. 2. Other proven arm-twisters include [[Fox News]]'s [[Sean Hannity]], [[National Public Radio]]'s [[Terry Gross]], [[radio]] personality [[Don Imus]], and [[CBS]]' ''[[60 Minutes]]''. But no one comes close to Oprah's clout: Publishers estimate that her power to sell a book is anywhere from 20 to 100 times that of any other media personality.&lt;ref name="wallet"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Why Oprah Opens Readers' Wallet | work = | pages = | publisher =Business Week | date =October 10, 2005 | url =http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_41/b3954059.htm | accessdate =October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009 it was reported that the influence of Winfrey's book club had even spread to [[Brazil]] with picks like [[A New Earth]] dominating Brazil's best-seller list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=87978 |title=Oprah’s Favorite Authors Dominate Bestseller Lists In Brazil |publisher=Webwire.com |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club generated so much success for some books that they went on to be adapted into films.  This subset includes ''[[The Deep End of the Ocean]]'' and ''[[The Reader]]''.

At the show's conclusion in May 2011, [[Nielsen BookScan]] created a list of the top-10 bestsellers from the club's final 10 years (prior data was unavailable).&lt;ref name=flamm/&gt; The top four with sales figures as of May 2011:&lt;ref&gt;Jason Boog. [http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/top-10-bestselling-books-in-oprahs-book-club_b30637 "Top 10 Bestselling Books in Oprah’s Book Club"], GalleyCat, May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Eckhart Tolle]], ''[[A New Earth]]'' (2005), 3,370,000 copies
#[[James Frey]], ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'', 2,695,500 copies
#[[Elie Wiesel]], ''[[Night (book)|Night]]'', 2,021,000 copies
#[[Cormac McCarthy]], ''[[The Road]]'', 1,385,000 copies

In a 2014 paper by economist [[Craig L. Garthwaite]] published in ''[[American Economic Journal: Applied Economics]]'', it was reported that while the book club increased sales of individual titles in the list, it caused a short-term overall decrease in sales for the book industry as a whole after each selection was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Demand Spillovers, Combative Advertising, and Celebrity Endorsements |journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics |author1=Garthwaite, Craig L. |date=April 2014 |volume=6 |number=2 |doi=10.1257/app.6.2.76 |url=http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/app.6.2.76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig L. Garthwaite (2012). [http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/garthwaite/htm/research.htm "You Get a Book! And You Get A Book: Demand Spillovers, Combative Advertising, and Celebrity Endorsements"]&lt;/ref&gt; Since Oprah's selections were longer and more difficult classics that demanded greater time and energy to read, those people who were reading Oprah's books were not buying their usual fare of genre books, "there were statistically significant decreases for mysteries and action/adventure novels. Romances also saw a sales decline," following an Oprah endorsement. In the 12 weeks following an endorsement, "weekly adult fiction book sales decreased by a statistically significant 2.5 percent."&lt;ref name=drum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/03/unintended-consequences-oprahs-book-clubs|title=The Unintended Consequences of Oprah's Book Club|date=Mar 1, 2012|accessdate=Mar 1, 2012|author=Kevin Drum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The club has received critical commentaries from the literary community. 

[[Scott Stossel]], an editor at ''[[The Atlantic]]'', wrote:
:"There is something so relentlessly ''therapeutic'', so consciously ''self-improving'' about the book club that it seems antithetical to discussions of serious literature. Literature should disturb the mind and derange the senses; it can be palliative, but it is not meant to be the easy, soothing one that Oprah would make it."&lt;ref name=minzesheimer/&gt;

==Controversies==
=== Jonathan Franzen ===
[[Jonathan Franzen]] felt conflicted about his book ''[[The Corrections]]'' being chosen as a book club selection. After the announcement was made, he expressed distaste with being in the company of other Oprah's Book Club authors, saying in an interview that Winfrey had "picked some good books, but she's picked enough schmaltzy, one-dimensional ones that I cringe, myself, even though I think she's really smart and she's really fighting the good fight."&lt;ref name="franzen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/authors/franzen.html%20Powells.com |title= Jonathan Franzen Uncorrected  |accessdate=October 5, 2007 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Franzen added that his novel was a "hard book for that audience."&lt;ref name="people1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schindehette |first=Susan |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20135698,00.html |title=Novel Approach - Feuds, The Corrections, The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jonathan Franzen, Oprah Winfrey |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Franzen also felt conflicted about being selected by Winfrey because he was hoping to attract a male audience.&lt;ref name="mobylives1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobylives.com/Oprah_v_Franzen.html |title=Too Cool for Oprah |publisher=Mobylives.com |date=October 26, 2001 |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the criticism Franzen was uninvited from the televised book club dinner, and he apologized profusely.&lt;ref name="mediabistro1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/reading/books/0374100128/ |title=Content: Reading Room |publisher=mediabistro |date= |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Franzen was not invited back, he suggested that perhaps he and Winfrey could still have dinner but not on TV, but Winfrey was all booked up, and her spokesperson said she was moving on.&lt;ref name="people1"/&gt;

Other writers were critical of Franzen. Writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'', author [[Verlyn Klinkenborg]] suggested that "lurking behind Mr. Franzen's rejection of Ms. Winfrey is an elemental distrust of readers, except for the ones he designates."&lt;ref name=Klinkenborg-NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Klinkenborg|first=Verlyn|title=The Not-Yet-Ready-for-Prime-Time Novelist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/opinion/editorial-observer-the-not-yet-ready-for-prime-time-novelist.html|accessdate= July 4, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Andre Dubus III]] wrote that, "It is so elitist it offends me deeply. The assumption that high art is not for the masses, that they won't understand it and they don't deserve it – I find that reprehensible. Is that a judgment on the audience? Or on the books in whose company he would be?" &lt;ref name="mediabistro1"/&gt; Editor Dennis Loy Johnson questioned Franzen's motivations, asking, "Is it misogyny, do you think, or class prejudice, or worse?"&lt;ref name="mobylives1"/&gt;

In 2010, Oprah chose another of Franzen's books, ''[[Freedom (Franzen novel)|Freedom]]'', for her book club.  She says that after she read a copy of the book Franzen had sent her with a note, she called the author and gained his permission.&lt;ref name=announce&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprahs-Book-Club-Announcement-Video |title=Oprah's Book Club Announcement - Video |publisher=Oprah.com |date=September 17, 2010 |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oprah said "we have a little history this author and I", but called the book "a masterpiece", and according to an article in the ''Los Angeles Times'', she "seems to have forgiven the bestselling author after their 2001 kerfuffle".&lt;ref name=announce/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-0918-franzen-oprah-20100918,0,245001,print.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Carolyn | last=Kellogg | date=September 18, 2010 | title=Oprah's book club christens Franzen's 'Freedom'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== James Frey ===

In late 2005 and early 2006, Oprah's Book Club was again embroiled in controversy. Winfrey selected [[James Frey]]'s ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' for the September 2005 selection. ''Pieces'' is a book billed as a [[memoir]]&amp;mdash;a true account of Frey's life as an [[alcoholic]], [[drug addict]], and criminal. It became the Book Club's greatest selling book up to that point, and many readers spoke of how the account helped free them from drugs as well. But the additional attention focused on Frey's memoir soon led to critics questioning the validity of Frey's supposedly true account, especially regarding his treatment while in a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] facility and his stories of time spent in [[Prison|jail]]. Initially, Frey convinced [[Larry King]] that the embellishments in his book were of a sort that could be found in any literary memoir; Winfrey encouraged debate about how creative non-fiction should be classified, and cited the inspirational impact Frey's work had had on so many of her viewers. But as more accusations against the book surfaced, Winfrey invited Frey on the show to find out directly from him whether he had lied to her and her viewers. During a heated live televised debate, Winfrey forced Frey to admit that he had indeed lied about spending time in jail, and that he had no idea whether he had two [[root canal]]s without painkillers or not, despite devoting several pages to describing them in excruciating detail. Winfrey then brought out Frey's publisher [[Nan Talese]] to defend her decision to classify the book as a memoir, and forced Talese to admit that she had done nothing to check the book's veracity, despite the fact that her representatives had assured Winfrey's staff that the book was indeed non-fiction and described it as "brutally honest" in a press release.

The media feasted over the televised showdown. [[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]] of the ''New York Times'' wrote: "Both Mr. Frey and Ms. Talese were snapped in two like dry winter twigs."&lt;ref name="truthiness"/&gt; "Oprah annihilates Frey," proclaimed Larry King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/01/lkl.01.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=May 1, 2007 |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York Times'' columnist [[Maureen Dowd]] wrote, "It was a huge relief, after our long national slide into untruth and no consequences, into [[Swift boating]] and swift bucks, into [[George W. Bush|W]].'s delusion and denial, to see the Empress of Empathy icily hold someone accountable for lying,"&lt;ref name="bunk"&gt;{{cite news | last =Dowd | first =Maureen | coauthors = | title =Oprah's Bunk Club | work = | pages = | publisher =The New York Times | date =January 8, 2006 | url =http://homepage.mac.com/imfalse/chapel_annex/oprahs_bunk_club.html | accessdate =October 5, 2007 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070912140931/http://homepage.mac.com/imfalse/chapel_annex/oprahs_bunk_club.html | archivedate =September 12, 2007 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Washington Post]]'''s [[Richard Cohen (Washington Post columnist)|Richard Cohen]] was so impressed by the confrontation that he crowned Winfrey "[[Mensch]] of the Year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Poniewozik  | first =James | coauthors = | title =Oprah Clarifies Her Position: Truth, Good.

'''Renaissance art''' is the painting, sculpture and decorative arts of the period of European history, emerging as a distinct style in Italy in about 1400, in parallel with developments which occurred in [[Renaissance philosophy|philosophy]], [[Renaissance literature|literature]], [[Renaissance music|music]], and [[Renaissance science|science]]. Renaissance art, perceived as the noblest of ancient traditions, took as its foundation the art of [[Classical antiquity]], but transformed that tradition by absorbing recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by applying contemporary scientific knowledge. Renaissance art, with [[Renaissance Humanism|Renaissance Humanist philosophy]], spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities. Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the [[Early Modern]] age.
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|450px|[[Sandro Botticelli]], ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', c. 1485. [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]
In many parts of Europe, Early Renaissance art was created in parallel with [[Gothic art|Late Medieval art]].
Renaissance art, painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and literature produced during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries in Europe under the combined influences of an increased awareness of nature, a revival of classical learning, and a more individualistic view of man. Scholars no longer believe that the Renaissance marked an abrupt break with medieval values, as is suggested by the French word renaissance, literally “rebirth.” Rather, historical sources suggest that interest in nature, humanistic learning, and individualism were already present in the late medieval period and became dominant in 15th- and 16th-century Italy concurrently with social and economic changes such as the secularization of daily life, the rise of a rational money-credit economy, and greatly increased social mobility.
The influences upon the development of Renaissance men and women in the early 15th century are those that also affected Philosophy, Literature, Architecture, Theology, Science, Government, and other aspects of society. The following list presents a summary, dealt with more fully in the main articles that are cited above.
* Classical texts, lost to European scholars for centuries, became available. These included Philosophy, Prose, Poetry, Drama, Science, a thesis on the Arts, and Early Christian Theology.
* Simultaneously, Europe gained access to advanced mathematics which had its provenance in the works of Islamic scholars.
* The advent of movable type [[printing]] in the 15th century meant that ideas could be disseminated easily, and an increasing number of books were written for a broad public.
* The establishment of the [[Medici]] Bank and the subsequent trade it generated brought unprecedented wealth to a single Italian city, [[Florence]].
* [[Cosimo de' Medici the Elder|Cosimo de' Medici]] set a new standard for patronage of the arts, not associated with the church or monarchy.
* [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosophy meant that man's relationship with humanity, the universe and with God was no longer the exclusive province of the Church.
* A revived interest in the [[Classical literature|Classics]] brought about the first archaeological study of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains by the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and sculptor [[Donatello]]. The revival of a style of architecture based on classical precedents inspired a corresponding classicism in painting and sculpture, which manifested itself as early as the 1420s in the paintings of [[Masaccio]] and [[Uccello]].
* The improvement of [[oil paint]] and developments in oil-painting technique by Dutch artists such as [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and [[Hugo van der Goes]] led to its adoption in Italy from about 1475 and had ultimately lasting effects on painting practices, worldwide.
* The [[serendipity|serendipitous]] presence within the region of [[Florence]] in the early 15th century of certain individuals of artistic genius, most notably [[Masaccio]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]] formed an ethos out of which sprang the great masters of the High Renaissance, as well as supporting and encouraging many lesser artists to achieve work of extraordinary quality.&lt;ref name=Hartt&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art'', (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;
* A similar heritage of artistic achievement occurred in [[Venice]] through the talented [[Jacopo Bellini|Bellini]] family, their influential in-law [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]] and [[Tintoretto]].&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB&gt;Michael Baxandall, ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy'', (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Aston, ''The Fifteenth Century, the Prospect of Europe'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto-Renaissance in Italy, 1280–1400===

{{main article|Italian Renaissance painting}}
In Italy in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the sculpture of [[Nicola Pisano]] and his son [[Giovanni Pisano]], working at [[Pisa]], [[Siena]] and [[Pistoia]] shows markedly classicising tendencies, probably influenced by the familiarity of these artists with ancient Roman [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]]. Their masterpieces are the pulpits of the Baptistery and [[Pisa Cathedral|Cathedral of Pisa]]. 

Contemporary with Giovanni Pisano, the Florentine painter [[Giotto]] developed a manner of figurative painting that was unprecedentedly naturalistic, three-dimensional, lifelike and classicist, when compared with that of his contemporaries and teacher [[Cimabue]]. Giotto, whose greatest work is the cycle of the ''Life of Christ'' at the [[Arena Chapel]] in [[Padua]], was seen by the 16th century biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] as "rescuing and restoring art" from the "crude, traditional, Byzantine style" prevalent in Italy in the 13th century.

The painters of the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Low Countries]] in this period included [[Jan van Eyck]], his brother [[Hubert van Eyck]], [[Robert Campin]], [[Hans Memling]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and [[Hugo van der Goes]]. Their painting developed partly independently of Early Italian Renaissance painting, and without the influence of a deliberate and conscious striving to revive antiquity. 

The style of painting grew directly out of medieval painting in [[tempera]], on panels and [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and other forms such as [[stained glass]]; the medium of [[fresco]] was less common in northern Europe.  The medium used was [[oil paint]], which had long been utilised for painting leather ceremonial shields and accoutrements, because it was flexible and relatively durable. The earliest Netherlandish oil paintings are meticulous and detailed like tempera paintings. The material lent itself to the depiction of tonal variations and texture, so facilitating the observation of nature in great detail.  

The Netherlandish painters did not approach the creation of a picture through a framework of linear perspective and correct proportion. They maintained a medieval view of hierarchical proportion and religious symbolism, while delighting in a realistic treatment of material elements, both natural and man-made. Jan van Eyck, with his brother [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]], painted ''[[Ghent Altarpiece|The Altarpiece of the Mystical Lamb]]''. It is probable that [[Antonello da Messina]] became familiar with Van Eyck's work, while in Naples or Sicily. In 1475, Hugo van der Goes' ''[[Portinari Altarpiece]]'' arrived in Florence where it was to have a profound influence on many painters, most immediately [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] who painted an altarpiece imitating its elements.

A very significant Netherlandish painter towards the end of the period was [[Hieronymus Bosch]], who employed the type of fanciful forms that were often utilized to decorate borders and letters in illuminated manuscripts, combining plant and animal forms with architectonic ones. When taken from the context of the illumination and peopled with humans, these forms give Bosch's paintings a surreal quality which have no parallel in the work of any other Renaissance painter. His masterpiece is the triptych ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.

{{main article|Italian Renaissance painting}}
Although both the Pisanos and Giotto had students and followers, the first truly Renaissance artists were not to emerge in Florence until 1401 with the competition to sculpt a set of [[Florence Baptistry#Lorenzo Ghiberti|bronze doors]] of the Baptistery of [[Florence Cathedral]] which drew entries from seven young sculptors including [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and the winner, [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]. Brunelleschi, most famous as the architect of the dome of Florence Cathedral and the Church of San Lorenzo, created a number of sculptural works, including a lifesized Crucifix in [[Santa Maria Novella]], renowned for its naturalism. His studies of perspective are thought to have influenced the painter [[Masaccio]]. [[Donatello]] became renowned as the greatest sculptor of the Early Renaissance, his masterpieces being his Humanist and unusually erotic statue of [[David (Bible)|David]], one of the icons of the Florentine republic, and his great monument to [[Gattamelata]], the first large equestrian bronze to be created since Roman times.

The contemporary of Donatello, [[Masaccio]], was the painterly descendant of Giotto and began the Early Renaissance in Italian Painting in 1425, furthering the trend towards solidity of form and naturalism of face and gesture that Giotto had begun a century earlier.  From 1425-28, Masaccio completed several panel paintings but is best known for the fresco cycle that he began in the [[Brancacci Chapel]] with the older artist [[Masolino]] and which had profound influence on later painters, including [[Michelangelo]]. Masaccio's developments were carried forward in the paintings of [[Fra Angelico]], particularly in his frescos at the Convent of San Marco in Florence.

The treatment of the elements of perspective and light in painting was of particular concern to 15th-century Florentine painters. [[Uccello]] was so obsessed with trying to achieve an appearance of perspective that, according to Vasari, it disturbed his sleep. His solutions can be seen in his masterpiece set of three paintings, the [[Battle of San Romano]] which is believed to have been completed by 1460. [[Piero della Francesca]] made systematic and scientific studies of both light and linear perspective, the results of which can be seen in his fresco cycle of ''[[The History of the True Cross]]'' in [[San Francesco, Arezzo]].

In [[Naples]], the painter [[Antonello da Messina]] began using oil paints for portraits and religious paintings at a date that preceded other Italian painters, possibly about 1450. He carried this technique north and influenced the painters of [[Venice]]. One of the most significant painters of Northern Italy was [[Andrea Mantegna]], who decorated the interior of a room, ''the [[Camera degli Sposi]]'' for his patron [[Ludovico III Gonzaga|Ludovico Gonzaga]], setting portraits of the family and court into an illusionistic architectural space.

The end period of the Early Renaissance in Italian art is marked, like its beginning, by a particular commission that drew artists together, this time in cooperation rather than competition. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] had rebuilt the Papal Chapel, named the [[Sistine Chapel]] in his honour, and commissioned a group of artists, [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]] to decorate its wall with fresco cycles depicting ''the Life of Christ'' and ''the Life of Moses''. In the sixteen large paintings, the artists, although each working in his individual style, agreed on principals of format, and utilised the techniques of lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation that had been carried to a high point in the large Florentine studios of Ghiberti, Verrocchio, Ghirlandaio and Perugino.

===Early Renaissance in France, 1375–1528===
The artists of France, (including duchies such as [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]) were often associated with courts, providing illuminated manuscripts and portraits for the nobility as well as devotional paintings and altarpieces.  Among the most famous were the [[Limbourg brothers]], Flemish illuminators and creators of the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]. [[Jean Fouquet]], painter of the royal court, visited Italy in 1437 and reflects the influence of Florentine painters such as [[Paolo Uccello]]. Although best known for his portraits such as that of [[Charles VII of France]] Fouquet also created illuminations, and is thought to be the inventor of the portrait miniature. There were a number of artists at this date who painted famed altarpieces, that are stylistically quite distinct from both the Italian and the Flemish. These include two enigmatic figures, [[Enguerrand Quarton]] to whom is ascribed the ''Pieta of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon'', and [[Jean Hey]], otherwise known as "the Master of Moulins" after his most famous work, ''the Moulins Altarpiece''. In these works realism and close observation of the human figure, emotions and lighting are combined with a Medieval formality, which includes gilt backgrounds.

===High Renaissance in Italy, 1495-1520===
{{main article|High Renaissance|Italian Renaissance painting}}
[[File:Creación de Adám.jpg|thumb|Michelangelo, (c. 1511) ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'', from the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]]]
The "universal genius" [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was to further perfect the aspects of pictorial art (lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation) that had preoccupied artists of the Early Renaissance, in a lifetime of studying and meticulously recording his observations of the natural world. His adoption of oil paint as his primary media meant that he could depict light and its effects on the landscape and objects more naturally and with greater dramatic effect than had ever been done before, as demonstrated in the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. His dissection of cadavers carried forward the understanding of skeletal and muscular anatomy, as seen in the unfinished ''St Jerome''.  His depiction of human emotion in ''The Last Supper'', completed 1495-1498, set the benchmark for religious painting.

The art of Leonardo's younger contemporary [[Michelangelo]] took a very different direction. Michelangelo, in neither his painting nor his sculpture demonstrates any interest in the observation of any natural object except the human body. He perfected his technique in depicting it, while in his early twenties, by the creation of the enormous marble statue of ''David'' and the group ''the Pieta'', in [[St Peter's Basilica]], Rome. He then set about an exploration of the expressive possibilities of the human anatomy. His commission by [[Pope Julius II]] to paint the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] resulted in the supreme masterpiece of figurative composition, which was to have profound effect on every subsequent generation of European artists&lt;ref&gt;https://www.laetitiana.co.uk/2014/07/introduction-to-renaissance-movement.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  His later work, ''The Last Judgement'', painted on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel between 1534 and 1541 shows a Mannerist (also called Late Renaissance) style with generally elongated bodies which took over from the High Renaissance style between 1520 and 1530.

Standing alongside Leonardo and Michelangelo as the third great painter of the High Renaissance was the younger [[Raphael]], who in a short life span painted a great number of lifelike and engaging portraits, including those of Pope Julius II and his successor [[Pope Leo X]], and numerous portrayals of the Madonna and Christ Child, including the [[Sistine Madonna]].  His death in 1520 at age 37 is considered by many art historians to be the end of the High Renaissance period, although some individual artists continued working in the High Renaissance style for many years thereafter.

In Northern Italy the High Renaissance is represented by the latter works of [[Giovanni Bellini]], especially religious paintings, which include several large altarpieces of a type known as "[[Sacred Conversation]]" which show a group of saints around the enthroned Madonna. His contemporary [[Giorgione]], who died at about the age of 32 in 1510, left a small number of enigmatic works, including ''[[The Tempest (painting)|The Tempest]]'', the subject of which has remained a matter of speculation. The earliest works of [[Titian]] date from the era of the High Renaissance, including a massive altarpiece ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|The Assumption of the Virgin]]'' which combines human action and drama with spectacular colour and atmosphere.  Titian continued painting in a generally High Renaissance style until near the end of his career in the 1570s, although he increasingly used colour and light over line to define his figures.

===German Renaissance art===

{{main article|German Renaissance}}
German Renaissance art falls into the broader category of the Renaissance in Northern Europe, also known as the [[Northern Renaissance]]. 
Renaissance influences began to appear in German art in the 15th century, but this trend was not widespread. Gardner's ''Art Through the Ages'' identifies [[Michael Pacher]], a painter and sculptor, as the first German artist whose work begins to show Italian Renaissance influences. According to that source, Pacher's painting, ''St. Wolfgang Forces the Devil to Hold His Prayerbook'' (c.1481), is Late Gothic in style, but also shows the influence of the Italian artist, [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|page=555|edition=6th|ref=Gardner|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Artisans, such as engravers, became more concerned with aesthetics rather than just perfecting their craft. Germany had master engravers, such as [[Martin Schongauer]], who did metal engravings in the late 1400s. Gardner relates this mastery of the graphic arts to advances in printing which occurred in Germany, and says that metal engraving began to replace the woodcut during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=555–556|edition=6th|ref=Gardner|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some artists, such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], continued to do woodcuts. Both Gardner and Russell describe the fine quality of Dürer's woodcuts, with Russell stating, in ''The World of Dürer'', that Dürer "elevated them into high works of art."&lt;ref name="The World of Dürer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Francis|title=The World of Dürer|date=1967|publisher=Time Life Books, Time Inc.|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the 1500s, Renaissance art in Germany became more common as, according to Gardner, "The art of northern Europe during the sixteenth century is characterized by a sudden awareness of the advances made by the Italian Renaissance and by a desire to assimilate this new style as rapidly as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=556–557|edition=6th|ref=Gardner|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best known practitioners of German Renaissance art was Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528). Dürer's fascination with classical ideas led him to Italy to study art. Both Gardner and Russell recognized the importance of Durer's contribution to German art in bringing Italian Renaissance styles and ideas to Germany.&lt;ref name="The World of Dürer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=561|edition=6th|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell calls this "Opening the Gothic windows of German art,"&lt;ref name="The World of Dürer"/&gt; while Gardner calls it Dürer's "life mission."&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"/&gt; Importantly, as Gardner points out, Dürer "was the first northern artist who fully understood the basic aims of the southern Renaissance,"&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"/&gt; although his style did not always reflect that. The same source says that [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] (1497–1543) successfully assimilated Italian ideas while also keeping "northern traditions of close realism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=564|edition=6th|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrasted against Dürer's tendency to work in "his own native German style"&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"/&gt; instead of combining German and Italian styles.
Other important artists of the German Renaissance were [[Matthias Grünewald|Grünewald]], [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=557|edition=6th|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
Britain was very late to develop a Renaissance style and most [[artists of the Tudor court]] were imported foreigners, usually from the [[Low countries]], including [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], who died in England.  One exception was the [[portrait miniature]], which artists including [[Nicholas Hilliard]] developed into a distinct genre, well before it became popular in the rest of Europe. [[Renaissance_in_Scotland#Art|Renaissance art in Scotland]] was similarly dependent on imported artists, and largely restricted to the court.

==Themes and symbolism==
[[File:Magnificatio.jpg|thumb|[[Sandro Botticelli]], ''[[Magnificat Madonna]]'', 1480–81, tempera on panel, [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]
Renaissance artists painted a wide variety of themes. Religious [[altarpiece]]s, [[fresco]] cycles, and small works for private devotion were very popular. For inspiration, painters in both Italy and northern Europe frequently turned to [[Jacobus de Voragine]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]'' (1260), a highly influential source book for the lives of [[saint]]s that had already had a strong influence on Medieval artists. The rebirth of classical antiquity and [[Renaissance humanism]] also resulted in many [[Mythology|Mythological]] and [[history painting]]s. [[Ovidian]] stories, for example, were very popular. Decorative [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]], often used in painted architectural elements, was especially influenced by classical Roman motifs.

==Techniques==
* The use of [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]] – The first major treatment of the painting as a window into space appeared in the work of [[Giotto di Bondone]], at the beginning of the 14th century.  True linear perspective was formalized later, by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti]].  In addition to giving a more realistic presentation of art, it moved Renaissance painters into composing more paintings.
* [[Foreshortening]] – The term foreshortening refers to the artistic effect of shortening lines in a drawing so as to create an illusion of depth.
* [[Sfumato]] – The term sfumato was coined by Italian Renaissance artist, Leonardo da Vinci, and refers to a fine art painting technique of blurring or softening of sharp outlines by subtle and gradual blending of one tone into another through the use of thin glazes to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This stems from the Italian word sfumare meaning to evaporate or to fade out. The Latin origin is fumare, to smoke.
* [[Chiaroscuro]] – The term chiaroscuro refers to the fine art painting modeling effect of using a strong contrast between light and dark to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This comes from the Italian words meaning light (chiaro) and dark (scuro), a technique which came into wide use in the Baroque Period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21065">The [[rock art]] of south [[Oran Province|Oran]], are prehistoric engravings dating from the [[Neolithic]] period, which are found in the south of [[Oran Province]], [[Algeria]], in the Saharan [[Atlas Mountains]], in the regions (from west to east) of [[Figuig]], [[Ain Sefra]], [[El-Bayadh]], [[Aflou]] and [[Tiaret]]. Comparable engravings have been described, even further east, around [[Djelfa]] and in the region of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]]. Although in the past some archaeologists affirmed that these engravings derived from European [[Upper Paleolithic art]], this theory is today definitively rejected.

==History==
Less famous than the rock art at the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] site, the South Oran engravings have however been the subject of study since 1863. The most important works are notably those of A. Pomel (from 1893 to 1898), Stéphane Gsell (from 1901 to 1927), G. B. M. Flamand (from 1892 to 1921), [[Leo Frobenius]] and [[Hugo Obermaier]] (in 1925), l'Abbé [[Henri Breuil]] (from 1931 to 1957), L. Joleaud (from 1918 to 1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (from 1935 to 1955).

In 1955 and 1964 [[Henri Lhote]] had visits of several months to the region which allowed him to complete his former researches, to add hundreds of new descriptions and in 1970 to publish ''Les gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais'' in the series ''Mémoires du Centre de recherches anthropologiques préhistoriques et ethnographiques'' (CRAPE) directed at [[Algiers]] by Mouloud Mammeri.&lt;ref&gt;Published:Arts et Métiers graphiques, Paris, 210 pages et reproductions photographiques.&lt;/ref&gt; A notable part of the work was particularly devoted to the engravings of the El-Bayadh region. For Henri Lhote the South Oran region constitutes one of the "three great centres of art of the antelope age"&lt;ref name="Lhote"&gt;Henri Lhote, ''Les gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais'', (Arts et Métiers graphiques, Paris).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|194}} with Tassili ("Oued Djèrat") and [[Fezzan]].

==Date==
In this work Lhote tells that a hearth found at the "Station of Méandre", near to [[Brézina]], had been dated to 3900 years B.C., without this figure being capable of "being attributed to a definite category of the engravings which ornament the 'walls' of the station."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|193, n. 1}} The oldest of these engravings, on the other hand, show many affinities with those of Tassili which he proposes the minimum date of around 5000. There is therefore room, according to him, to "adopt it also for the South-Oranian material until better information may be forthcoming."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|163}}&lt;br /&gt;

==Chronology==

=== Older classifications===
A. Pomel, relying on identifications of animals which were later disputed, is at the root of the position of some authors who think that the engravings belong to the [[Palaeolithic]] age.

Stéphane Gsell, on the other hand, considered the most ancient engravings showing [[antelope]] and [[elephants]] to be [[Neolithic]], and he distinguished from them the images of [[Sheep|rams]], which according to him reflect an [[Ancient Egyptian]] ritual, which, like the depictions of ''caballins'' he attributed to the historical period.

The classification proposed by G. B. M. Flamand based on a study of techniques and patinas distinguished a first group of naturalistic engravings ([[hartebeest]], elephant, [[rhinoceros]], rams, donkeys, horses, antelopes), a second, libyco-berber group (engravings of decadent style, little horses, [[camel]]s, alphabetic characters) and two late groups (Arab inscriptions and modern graffiti).

For Hugo Obermaier there exist two sub-groups in the neolithic engravings, the older being of naturalistic style (hartebeest), the more recent of sub-naturalistic style (less elaborated and smaller-scale subjects). The cult of the ram with the sphere was, according to him, native to the populations of North Africa before having been adopted by the Egyptians.

Henri Breuil for his part distinguished three stages. In Stage I, contemporary with the end of the [[Capsian]], he places the large hartebeest with ringed horns, the elephants, and the very style-accomplished  as well as large human figures (Ksar El Amar). Stage II, which he attributes to the Lower Neolithic, brings together the large ram of Bou Alem, the hartebeest, rhinoceros, elephants and other animals in less accomplished style. The ram, for him, had not yet been domesticated but only tamed, and its cult is rather the origin than the reflex to the Egyptian belief. Stage III includes the figures in decadent style.

Raymond Vaufrey, studying the industry of flint implements found at the foot of the engraved rocks, takes the naturalistic figures to the "Neolithic of the Capsian tradition" deriving from the Neolithic of Egypt, and places them between 4200 and 2000 B.C. The ram, which he considers domesticated, is only a transposition of the Egyptian cult of [[Ammon]] and the representations of it cannot be older than 2200 B.C. For Henri Lhote however, there is no any archaeological argument which should cause one to separate the rams, supposed to be later, from the giant hartebeest, elephants or rhinoceros. Being like them of Neolithic age, they cannot derive from the Egyptian ram, and need not on that account be considered as the ancestors of a cult of which the ram of Ammon would constitute a late sequel.

==Classification of Henri Lhote==
Henri Lhote distinguished seven series in the mural art of the South Oranian.
[[Image:Kef el Akhal.cl.1.jpg|thumb|left|Kef el Akhal, large Hartebeest]]

1. Large engravings of monumental naturalistic style, or Large-scale Hartebeest style.    Beside the great hartebeest, elephants and rhinoceros, Lhote placed the numerous ostriches and antelopes, boars, lions and panthers. The animals are represented absolutely in profile apart from the hartebeest, in relative profile (the two-eyed formula being frequent). Lhote placed in this ensemble the human images which accompany them (of which the hands and feet have almost always six digits). No human figure with animal head having been found, he observed that "the hartebeest ensembles of the Saharan Atlas differ from those of Tassili-n-Ajjer and of Fezzan where these figures are running.&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|197}} The author also thinks that the domestication of the dog was achieved in this period and that the South Oranian presents the most ancient rock testimonies to it. This first stage also includes the "mythic animals". All these engravings are made by a punctuation of little dots or hollows, more or less connected, and then most often by a polishing apparently helped by a wooden utensil with the addition of wet sand. Some engravings show a beginning of polishing in the endoperigraphic area (head), others a complete polishing.
[[Image:Tazina 1.jpg|Tazina|thumb|right|Tazina, animals in the style of the "School of Tazina"]]

2. Small engravings in naturalistic style, or small-scale hartebeest stage. The stage would be constituted by the collection of engravings of more reduced size, of which the style has been designated as "School of Tazina" after the name of one of the sites. These naturalistic images show the same fauna (hartebeest, elephant and rhinoceros) as those of the preceding group but in very conventionalised forms, the legs and tails of the animals being very thinned out, the lines of the horns and the muzzle prolonged in a 'fantastic' way (Flamand), the lengthening of the body, the hind-quarters and the heads having inspired faulty identifications. The style is however not uniform and on certain murals these characteristic deformations co-exist with more realistic depictions. From a technical standpoint the finish of the engravings is regular, no trace surviving of a preliminary dotting-out, and the patina is similar to that of the preceding stage. The human depictions show the same character but the terminal parts of the limbs, hands and feet are generally rounded-off.
[[Image:Koudia Abd El Hak.cl.1.jpg|thumb|left|Koudia Abd El Hak, superimposed engravings.]]
From a chronological viewpoint, a single station (Koudiat Abd El Hak) shows an indisputable over-drawing, a little antelope with attenuated legs being overdrawn by a large elephant, although another would appear to be later than it. This fact obliged Lhote "to ask himself if the small-scale school might be earlier than that of the large engravings, or even if the two schools might have been contemporary." This latter hypothesis would have implied the existence "of two different gatherings of humans living side by side or, at the least, two artistic schools operating in parallel."

In his analysis Lhote shows that beyond the great similarity of the fauna represented and of the presence of the "orant-ram" association in both stages, the "orant-hartebeest" association was not indicated in the second, whereas the antelopes there are more numerous and the lions rarer. He adds that "the small-scale style extends towards the south Moroccan as far as the Rio de Oro, although the large-scale style remained confined in the south oran area, with certain migrations towards the north-east." The author's opinion therefore leans therefore towards the existence of two groups. Furthermore, the style of the small-scale art, by comparison with the static forms of the large-scale figures, reflects "rather an art which has already attained conventional formulae", "more advanced in the sense of a more evolved creative impulse" and therefore later. But in this hypothesis one should be able to rediscover traces of this so distinctive style in the later group of the decadent engravings, even though these seem, to the contrary, to derive from the large-scale school. In his conclusions the author considers that the small-scale engravings, often thought of as later decadent reminiscences, would be as old as those of the large hartebeest and elephants. "Whichever solution may prevail", concluded Lhote, one should consider that the identity of the fauna in each of the two groups indicates that there could not have been a great lapse of time between them, and that, despite the variation of styles, one can ask oneself if they do not represent two expressions of one and the same art."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|173}}
[[Image:Gouiret bent saloul, 3.jpg|thumb|left|Gouiret bent Saloul, human figure sexually displayed, with axe and shield]]

3. Engravings of sub-naturalistic style or decadent hartebeest stage. These are characterized by the mediocrity of their style and technique, reduced to a fairly clumsy dotting and an irregular final polishing. Their patina is clearer than for the two preceding stages, an observation confirmed by the fact that they are often found on the same murals. Their dimensions are more reduced than the first group, but larger than those of the second, with which they have nothing in common. The most common theme is of sexually displayed human figures, in a semi-crouching position, seen frontally, often together with numerous lions and ostriches. The fauna, less varied than in the two first groups, still includes the last representations of hartebeest of which the horns are not always ringed, and images of elephants, cattle and panthers. The association of man-ram disappears, which seems "to mark a rupture on the environment of the foregoing stages and shows an evolution of religious beliefs", replaced by the man-lion association, hartebeest and elephants no longer holding the place which they had formerly occupied. It is, according to Lhote, "the end, very degraded, of that remarkable artistic epoch of the south Oranian.&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|174}}

4. Engravings of the sub-naturalist style of the husbandmen or the [[bovid]]ian stage. [[Image:Gouiret bent Saloul.cl.1.jpg|thumb|right|Gouiret bent Saloul.]] The domestic cow with long or short horns sometimes wearing little spheres dominates this stage, the fauna being composed otherwise of elephants, antelope and ostriches, while images of humans are rare. The engravings are in various different styles, the formula schematic and massive, called "quadrangular" by H. Breuil, seeming like the most ancient. The main group of these engravings are not found in south Oran but in the valley of the Saoura (Sahara): Lhote supposes "a different origin to that of the preceding groups", showing "secondary infiltrations which have come from the south." For the author, "this bovidian civilization has certainly emerged from a Saharan milieu, but it has only made a very superficial appearance in the south Oran," following the tracks from the Hills of Ksour, having perhaps "another direct contact with the Sahara in the region of Brésina."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|175}}

5. Engravings of schematic carriages, which ought to occupy a comparable chronological position to that of the carriages of the Sahara.

6. Libyco-[[Berber People|Berber]] engravings.

7. Modern Arabo-Berber engravings.

==Other views==
[[Image:Bou Alem.cl.Gr bélier.jpg|thumb|upright|Bou Alem, the largest ram.]]
For F. Cominardi, analysing most recently the superimposition of engravings at "Koudiat Abd el Hak",&lt;ref&gt;F. Cominardi, Chebka Dirhem I nouvelle station rupestre des Monts des Ksour, dans ''Lybica '', Vol XXIV, CRAPE, Algiers, 1976, pp. 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt; it seems accepted that the naturalistic large-scale stage and the naturalistic small-scale stage (the most ancient level being constituted of very tiny engravings, the most recent by works of slightly superior execution) were contemporary, at least within a single epoch, "the first not being extinguished before the second began." The author leans, "on account of the arguments of the more evolved schematic style, towards placing the naturalistic large-scale stage in the first place, and to making the naturalistic small-scale stage begin before the disappearance of the former." [[Image:R'cheg Dirhem.cl.2bis.jpg|thumb|left|R'cheg Dirhem, hartebeest and human.]]According to F. Cominardi, "It would be during the lapse of time while they coexisted, that the engravings of the plaque of Koudiat were made. Were these two so differentiated artistic worlds brought into being by different peoples? It is possible.  It could be explained that they dwelt rarely together on the same rocks, and that the school of Tazina should be so individualized geographically." "If the small-scale naturalistic stage is, by comparison with the older stage, if not contemporary, at least starting to unfold during that time, one could, provisionally, place it between the 6th and the 4th millennium."

==Interpretation==
Henri Lhote identified among the south Oran engravings 41 images of rams or of sheep-like creatures, which is comparatively few in the sum of the representations, "especially as this figure includes small scale images and the uncertain ones of the decadent school."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|178}} Their symbolic attributes (spheroids, manes, collars) remain very variable, in contrast to those of the Egyptian ram of Ammon, which was furnished right from the start with the symbols which it would always keep, one could claim, according to the author, that they had not yet been fixed in a definitive fashion and we find ourselves here looking at a cult which was just beginning to take form." The difference "shows, if it were still necessary to show, that the South Oranians had not adopted the cult from Egypt.&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|180}}

In 13 cases the engraved rams are associated with human figures. Analyzing their possible relations, the author's conclusion is "that the Ram played a religious role of first importance to the south-Oranians, that its association with man, though he may have been in a praying position, should have been armed with an axe, shows that it certainly had the character of a divinity which one would ask things of and which one might, on suitable occasions, sacrifice."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|180}} This role, he adds, "is well attested in the two hartebeest stages of large and small scale, but disappears in the age of the decadent style where nothing of it remains except the mere vestige."

The representations of hartebeest, more numerous (73 for the region) and in 13 cases associated with the presence of a human, show despite the absence of the spheroid "which may have been the object of rites associating it with men,"&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|181}} that it "held an eminent place in the beliefs of the ancient populations of the South Oranians.&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|183}} As for the lion, represented with facing head in the old hartebeest stage where it is only a single time associated with a man, but shown in profile in the decadent style where its associations with humans are on the contrary quite frequent, it seems to have replaced hartebeest and rams. One should be able, according to Lhote, "to interpret this phenomenon as a radical modification in the behaviour of south Oranians, a real change, unless it represents the arrival of new human populations."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|183}}

For Henri Lhote, "the south Oran engravings are certainly among the oldest artistic and cultic manifestations of Africa which we know of, and the beliefs of which they are the reflection may perhaps have helped to influence the later populations of the [[Nile valley]] and of black Africa where [[animism]] was to undergo so great a development."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|182–3}}

==Who were the artists?==
Conjectures on the identities of the artists have been many. Lhote tells that some have believed them to belong to the black populations ancestral to the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and the [[Hausa people|Hausas]]. But the [[Tuareg]], the Egyptians and the ancestors of the [[Berber People|Berbers]] have also been invoked. They have also been thought to have been the [[Cro-Magnon]]s, the husbandmen and farmers of Asiatic origin, the Harratines, the Proto-Libyans and the [[Bushmen]]. In the absence of discoveries in the region of neolithic human remains and of an adequate understanding of the ambiguity of the images, "one should avoid any absolute identification" or "definitive option".&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|196–8}}

This article is an overview of '''[[Samuel Johnson]]'s literary criticism'''.

==Poetry==
Johnson's literature, especially his ''Lives of the Poets'' series, is marked by various opinions on what would make a poetic work excellent. He believed that the best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use of decorative or purposefully archaic language. In particular, he was suspicious of [[John Milton]]'s language, whose blank verse would mislead later poets, and could not stand the poetic language of [[Thomas Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Gray, Johnson wrote, "Gray thought his language more poetical as it was more remote from common use".&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Gray''&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson would sometimes write parodies of poetry that he felt was poorly done; one such example is his translation of [[Euripides]]'s play, ''Medea'' in a parody of one poet's style alongside of his version of how the play should be translated. His greatest complaint was the overuse of obscure allusion found in works like Milton's ''Lycidas'', and he preferred poetry that could be easily read.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem would incorporate new and unique imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his shorter works, Johnson preferred shorter lines and to fill his work with a feeling of empathy, which possibly influenced [[Alfred Edward Housman]]'s poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=31, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''London'', his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the form to express his political opinion. It is a poem of his youth and deals with the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. As [[Donald Greene]] claims, "its charm comes from youthful exuberance and violence with which the witty invective comes tumbling out" in lines like:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Here malice, rapine, accident conspire,
And now a rabble rages, now a fire;
Their ambush here relentless ruffians lay,
And here the fell attorney prowls for prey;
Here falling houses thunder on your head,
And here a female atheist talks you dead.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, his second imitation, ''The Vanity of Human Wishes'', is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe Christian ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but are part of Johnson's works as a whole. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
In terms of biography, Johnson did not agree with [[Plutarch]]'s model of using biographies to teach morals and compliment the subjects. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the subjects accurately, including any negative aspects of an individual's life. Although revolutionary and more accurate as a biographer, Johnson had to struggle with his beliefs against a society that was unwilling to hear of details that may be viewed as tarnishing a reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Rambler'' 60, Johnson put forth why he thought society could not be comfortable with hearing the negative truth of individuals that they admire:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

&lt;blockquote&gt;All joy or sorrow for the happiness or calamities of others is produced by an act of imagination that realizes the event, however fictitious, or approximates it, however remote, by placing us, for a time, in the condition of him whose fortune we contemplate, so that we feel, while the deception lasts, whatever motions would be excited by the same good or evil happening to ourselves... Our passions are therefore more strongly moved, in proportion as we can more readily adopt the pains or pleasure proposed to our minds, by recognizing them as once our own.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Also, Johnson did not feel that biography should be limited to the most important people, but felt that the lives of lesser individuals could be deemed the most significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Lives of the Poets'', he chose great and lesser poets, and throughout all of his biographies, he always insisted on including what others may consider as trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to autobiography, and diaries including his own, Johnson considered that genre of work as one having the most significance; he explains this in ''Idler'' 84, when he described how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort their own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexicography==
Johnson's thoughts on biography and on poetry found their union in his understanding of what would make a good critic. His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism, including his ''Dictionary'' to which he wrote: "I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France, ''for the use of such as aspire to exactness of criticism, or elegance of style''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the smaller dictionary was written for the masses and become the common household dictionary, Johnson's original dictionary was an academic tool that examined how words were used, especially those uses that were found in literary works. To achieve this purpose, Johnson included quotations from Bacon, Hooker, Milton, Shakespeare, Spenser, and many others from the literary fields that Johnson thought were most important: natural science, philosophy, poetry, and theology. These quotes and usages were all compared and carefully studied, so that others could understand what words meant in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Plays of Shakespeare title page.jpg|thumb|left|''Plays of William Shakespeare'' (1773 expanded edition) title page]]

Johnson felt that words, in and of themselves, were meaningless, but that meaning comes from context. The only way to understand the word is to examine its usage, and a critic must understand lexicography before they can understand what people are saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later critics would attempt to create theories to analyse the aesthetics of literature, but Johnson was not a theorist and he used his ideas only for the practical purpose to better read the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to Shakespeare's plays, Johnson emphasised the role of a reader in understanding language when he wrote, "If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers, it is to be imputed to the nature of his work, which required the use of common colloquial language, and consequently admitted many phrases allusive, elliptical, and proverbial, such as we speak and hear every hour without observing them".&lt;ref name="Green p. 141"&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shakespeare==
His works on Shakespeare were not devoted just to Shakespeare, but to critical theory as a whole, and, in his ''Preface'' to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous belief of the [[classical unities]] and establishes a more natural theory on what makes drama work: drama should be faithful to life. In particular, Johnson claimed that "Among [Shakespeare's] other excellences it ought to be remarked, because it has hitherto been unnoticed, that his ''heroes are men'', that the love and hatred, the hopes and fears, of his chief personages are such as common to other human beings... Shakespeare's excellence is not the fiction of a tale, but the representation of life: and his reputation is therefore safe, till human nature shall be changed."&lt;ref name="Green p. 141"/&gt; Besides defending Shakespeare, Johnson was willing to discuss Shakespeare's faults, especially his lacking of morality, his vulgarity, and carelessness in crafting plots.&lt;ref name="Greene p. 142"&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Besides direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. In his ''Preface'', Johnson analysed the various versions of Shakespeare's plays and argued how an editor should work on them. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions that each contained errors from the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors deeming difficult words as incorrect and changing them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way, and, when creating his own edition of Shakespeare's plays, he relied on the thousands of quotations and notes that he used in crafting his ''Dictionary'' to restore, to the best of his knowledge, the original text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarah Bernhardt''' ({{IPA-fr|saʁa bɛʁnɑʁt|lang}};&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{YouTube|FWGjd39dPg8|Her own pronunciation, listen e.g. to}}&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Henriette-Rosine Bernard''', 22 or 23 October 1844 – 26 March 1923) was a [[French people|French]] [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] actress who starred in some of the most popular French plays of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including ''[[La Dame Aux Camelias]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas, ''fils'']], ''[[Ruy Blas]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]], ''[[Fédora]]'' and ''[[La Tosca]]'' by [[Victorien Sardou]], and ''[[L'Aiglon]]'' by [[Edmond Rostand]]. She also played male roles, including Shakespeare's [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]. Rostand called her "the queen of the pose and the princess of the gesture", while Hugo praised her "golden voice". She made several theatrical tours around the world, and was one of the first prominent actresses to make sound recordings and to act in motion pictures.

==Early life==
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt and her mother.jpg|thumb|Sarah Bernhardt with her mother]]

Sarah Bernhardt was born Henriette-Rosine Bernard at 5 rue de L'École-de-Médicine in the Latin Quarter of [[Paris]] on 22 or 23 October 1844.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Some uncertainty exists about the date. See [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sarah-Bernhardt ''Encyclopedia Brittanica'' online Tierchant (2009), page 15 and Skinner (1967) page 1, and section below on birthdate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310044948/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sarah-Bernhardt |date=10 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the illegitimate daughter of Judith Bernard (also known as Julie and in France as Youle), a [[Dutch Jewish]] courtesan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/07/style/sarah-bernhardt-and-the-divine-lie.html|title=Sarah Bernhardt and the Divine Lie|last=Blume|first=Mary|date=7 October 2000|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20171214-sarah-bernhardt-was-she-the-first-a-list-actress|title=Sarah Bernhardt: Was she the first ‘A-list’ actress?|accessdate=23 June 2018|date=15 December 2017|last=Williams|first=Holly|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/sarah-bernhardt-goddess-with-a-golden-voice-347025.html|title=Sarah Bernhardt: Goddess with a golden voice|last=Koenig|first=Rhoda|date=22 February 2006|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/24/sarah-bernhardt-robert-gottlieb-review|title=Sarah: The Life of Sarah Bernhardt by Robert Gottlieb|accessdate=23 June 2018|date=24 October 2010|last=Laing|first=Olivia|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[prostitute]] with a wealthy or upper-class clientele. The name of her father is not recorded. According to some sources, he was probably the son of a wealthy merchant from Le Havre.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=13–14}} Bernhardt later wrote that her father's family paid for her education, insisted she be baptized as a Catholic, and left a large sum to be paid when she came of age.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=13–14}} Her mother traveled frequently, and saw little of her daughter. She placed the child with a nurse in [[Brittany]], then in a cottage in the Paris suburb of [[Neuilly]].{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|pages=13–14}}

When Sarah was seven, her mother sent her to a boarding school for young ladies in the Paris suburb of [[Neuilly-Auteuil-Passy|Auteuil]], paid with funds from her father's family. There, she acted in her first theatrical performance in the play ''Clothilde'', where she had the role of the Queen of the Fairies, and performed her first of many dramatic death scenes.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|pages=13–14}}

While Sarah was in the boarding school, her mother rose to the top ranks of Parisian courtesans, consorting with politicians, bankers, generals, and writers. Her patrons and friends included [[Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny]], the half-brother of Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and President of the French legislature.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=29}} At the age of 10, with the sponsorship of Morny, Sarah was admitted to Grandchamp, an exclusive Augustine [[convent school]] near [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].{{Sfn|Gold|Fizdale|1991|pages=17–20}} At the convent, she performed the part of the [[Archangel Raphael]] in the story of ''[[Tobias and the Angel (opera)|Tobias and the Angel]]''.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=25–26}} She declared her intention to become a nun, but did not always follow convent rules; she was accused of sacrilege when she arranged a Christian burial, with a procession and ceremony, for her pet lizard.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=28}}

In 1859, Sarah learned that her father had died overseas.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=68}} Her mother summoned a family council, including Morny, to decide what to do with her. Morny proposed that Sarah should become an actress, an idea that horrified Sarah, as she had never been inside a theater. {{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=77}} Morny arranged for her to attend her first theater performance at the [[Comedie Française]] in a party which included her mother, Morny, and his friend [[Alexandre Dumas]], ''père''. The play they attended was ''Brittanicus'', by [[Jean Racine]], followed by the classical comedy ''Amphitryon'' by [[Plautus]]. Sarah was so moved by the emotion of the play, she began to sob loudly, disturbing the rest of the audience.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=77}} Morny and others in their party were angry at her and left, but Dumas comforted her, and later told Morny that he believed that she was destined for the stage. After the performance, Dumas called her "my little star".{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=22–24}}

Morny used his influence with the composer [[Daniel Auber]], the head of the [[Paris Conservatory]], to arrange for her to audition. She began preparing, as she described it in her memoirs, "with that vivid exaggeration with which I embrace any new enterprise."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|pages=78–85}} Dumas coached her. The jury was composed of Auber and five leading actors and actresses from the Comédie Française. She was supposed to recite verses from Racine, but no one had told her that she needed someone to give her cues as she recited. Bernhardt told the jury she would instead recite the fable of the Two Pigeons by [[La Fontaine]]. The jurors were skeptical, but the fervor and pathos of her recitation won them over, and she was invited to become a student.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=25–30}}

==Debut and departure from the Comédie-Française (1862–1864)==
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="250"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Bernhardt studied acting at the Conservatory from January 1860 until 1862 under two prominent actors of the Comédie Française, [[Joseph-Isidore Samson]] and Jean-Baptiste Provost. She wrote in her memoirs that Provost taught her diction and grand gestures, while Samson taught her the power of simplicity.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|pages=102–103}} For the stage, she changed her name from "Bernhard" to "Bernhardt". While studying, she also received her first marriage proposal, from a wealthy businessman who offered her 500 thousand francs. He wept when she refused. Bernhardt wrote that she was "confused, sorry, and delighted—because he loved me the way people love in plays at the theater."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=96}}

Before the first examination for her tragedy class, she tried to straighten her abundance of frizzy hair, which made it even more uncontrollable, and came down with a bad cold, which made her voice so nasal that she hardly recognized it. Furthermore, the parts assigned for her performance were classical and required carefully stylized emotions, while she preferred romanticism and fully and naturally expressing her emotions. The teachers ranked her 14th in tragedy and second in comedy.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=42–44}} Once again, Morny came to her rescue. He put in a good word for her with the National Minister of the Arts, [[Camille Doucet]]. Doucet recommended her to Edouard Thierry, the chief administrator of the [[Comédie-Française|Théâtre Français]],{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=42–44}} who offered Bernhardt a place as a ''pensionnaire'' at the theater, at a minimum salary.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=34–35}}

Bernhardt made her debut with the company on 31 August 1862 in the title role of Racine's ''[[Iphigénie]]''.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=45–46}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In her memoirs, Bernhardt gives the date of her debut as 1 September&lt;/ref&gt; Her premiere was not a success. She experienced stage fright and rushed her lines. Some audience members made fun of her thin figure. When the performance ended, Provost was waiting in the wings, and she asked his forgiveness. He told her, "I can forgive you, and you'll eventually forgive yourself, but Racine in his grave never will."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=37}} Francisque Sarcey, the influential theater critic of ''L'Opinion Nationale'' and ''Le Temps'', wrote: "she carries herself well and pronounces with perfect precision. That is all that can be said about her at the moment."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=37}}

Bernhardt did not remain long with the Comédie-Française. She played Henrietta in [[Molière|Molière's]] ''[[Les Femmes Savantes]]'' and Hippolyte in ''L'Étourdi'', and the title role in [[Eugène Scribe|Scribe's]] ''Valérie'', but did not impress the critics, or the other members of the company, who had resented her rapid rise. The weeks passed, but she was given no further roles.{{Sfn|Tierchant| 2009|page=47}} Her hot temper also got her into trouble; when a theater doorkeeper addressed her as "Little Bernhardt", she broke her umbrella over his head. She apologized profusely, and when the doorkeeper retired 20 years later, she bought a cottage for him in Normandy.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=38}} At a ceremony honoring the birthday of Molière on 15 January 1863, Bernhardt invited her younger sister, Regina, to accompany her. Regina accidentally stood on the train of the gown of a leading actress of the company, Zaire-Nathalie Martel (1816–1885), known as Madame Nathalie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monval |first=Georges |title=Comédie-française (1658–1900): Liste alphabétique des sociétaires depuis Molière jusqu'à nos jours |location=Paris |publisher=Aux Bureaux de l'Amateur d'autographes |year=1900 |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madame Nathalie pushed Regina off the gown, causing her to strike a stone column and gash her forehead. Regina and Madame Nathalie began shouting at one another, and Bernhardt stepped forward and slapped Madame Nathalie on the cheek. The older actress fell onto another actor. Thierry asked that Bernhardt apologize to Madame Nathalie. Bernhardt refused to do so until Madame Nathalie apologized to Regina. Bernhardt had already been scheduled for a new role with the theater, and had begun rehearsals. Madame Nathalie demanded that Bernhardt be dropped from the role unless she apologized. Since neither would yield, and Madame Nathalie was a senior member of the company, Thierry was forced to ask Bernhardt to leave.{{Sfn|Gold|Fizdale|1991|page=52}}

==The Gymnase and Brussels (1864–1866)==
Her family could not understand her departure from the theater; it was inconceivable to them that anyone would walk away from the most prestigious theater in Paris at the age of 18.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=135}} Instead, she went to a popular theater, the Gymnase, where she became an understudy to two of the leading actresses. She almost immediately caused another offstage scandal, when she was invited to recite poetry at a reception at the [[Tuileries Palace]] hosted by Napoleon III and the Empress Eugenie, along with other actors of the Gymnase. She chose to recite two romantic poems by Victor Hugo, unaware that Hugo was a bitter critic of the emperor. Following the first poem, the Emperor and Empress rose and walked out, followed by the court and the other guests.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=44}} Her next role at the Gymnase, as a foolish Russian princess, was entirely unsuited for her; her mother told her that her performance was "ridiculous".{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=135}} She decided abruptly to quit the theater to travel, and like her mother, to take on lovers. She went briefly to Spain, then, at the suggestion of Alexandre Dumas, to Belgium.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=42–46}}

She carried to Brussels letters of introduction from Dumas, and was admitted to the highest levels of society. According to some later accounts, she attended a masked ball in Brussels where she met the young [[Prince of Ligne|Prince de Ligne]], a young Belgian aristocrat, and had an affair with him.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=46–47}} Other accounts say that they met in Paris, where the Prince came often to attend the theater.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=55}} The affair was cut short when she learned that her mother had suffered a heart attack. She returned to Paris, where she found that her mother was better, but that she herself was pregnant from her affair with the Prince. She did not notify the Prince. Her mother did not want the fatherless child born under her roof, so she moved to a small apartment on rue Duphot, and on 22 December 1864, the 20-year-old actress gave birth to her only child, Maurice Bernhardt.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=48}}

Some accounts say that Prince Henri had not forgotten her. According to these versions, he learned her address from the theater, arrived in Paris, and moved into the apartment with Bernhardt. After a month, he returned to Brussels and told his family that he wanted to marry the actress. The family of the Prince sent his uncle, General de Ligne, to break up the romance, threatening to disinherit him if he married Bernhardt.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=47–52}} According to other accounts, the Prince denied any responsibility for the child.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=55}} She later called the affair "her abiding wound", but she never discussed Maurice's parentage with anyone. When asked who his father was, she sometimes answered, "I could never make up my mind whether his father was [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta]], Victor Hugo, or [[General Boulanger]]."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=52}} Many years later, in January 1885, when Bernhardt was famous, the Prince came to Paris and offered to formally recognize Maurice as his son, but Maurice politely declined, explaining he was entirely satisfied to be the son of Sarah Bernhardt.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=212}}

==The Odéon (1866–1872)==
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt - Le Passant.png|thumb|Bernhardt as the boy troubadour, Zanetto, in ''Le Passant'' (1869) by [[François Coppée]]]]

To support herself after the birth of Maurice, Bernhardt played minor roles and understudies at the Port-Saint-Martin, a popular melodrama theater. In early 1866, she obtained a reading with Felix Duquesnel, director of the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|Théâtre de L’Odéon]] on the Left Bank. Duquesnel described the reading years later, saying, "I had before me a creature who was marvelous gifted, intelligent to the point of genius, with enormous energy under an appearance frail and delicate, and a savage will." The co-director of the theater for finance, Charles de Chilly, wanted to reject her as unreliable and too thin, but Duquesnel was enchanted; he hired her for the theater at a modest salary of 150 francs a month, which he paid out of his own pocket.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=62}} The Odéon was second in prestige only to the Comédie Française, and unlike that very traditional theater, specialized in more modern productions. The Odéon was popular with the students of the Left Bank. Her first performances with the theater were not successful. She was cast in highly stylized and frivolous 18th-century comedies, whereas her strong point on stage was her complete sincerity.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=54}} Her thin figure also made her look ridiculous in the ornate costumes. Dumas, her strongest supporter, commented after one performance, "she has the head of a virgin and the body of a broomstick."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=55}} Soon, however, with different plays and more experience, her performances improved; she was praised for her performance of Cordelia in ''[[King Lear]].''{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} In June 1867, she played two roles in ''[[Athalie]]'' by Jean Racine;  the part of a young woman and a young boy, Zacharie, the first of many male parts she played in her career. The influential critic Sarcey wrote "... she charmed her audience like a little Orpheus."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=55}}

Her breakthrough performance was in the 1868 revival of ''Kean'' by Alexandre Dumas, in which she played the female lead part of Anna Danby. The play was interrupted in the beginning by disturbances in the audience by young spectators who called out, "Down with Dumas! Give us Hugo!". Bernhardt addressed the audience directly: "Friends, you wish to defend the cause of justice. Are you doing it by making Monsieur Dumas responsible for the banishment of Monsieur Hugo?".{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=68}} With this the audience laughed and applauded and fell silent. At the final curtain, she received an enormous ovation, and Dumas hurried backstage to congratulate her. When she exited the theater, a crowd had gathered at the stage door and tossed flowers at her. Her salary was immediately raised to 250 francs a month.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=55–58}}

Her next success was her performance in [[François Coppée]]'s ''Le Passant'', which premiered at the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|Odeon]] on 14 January 1868,{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=63}} playing the part of the boy troubadour, Zanetto, in a romantic renaissance tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Aston| first=Elaine| title=Sarah Bernhardt: A French Actress on the English Stage| year=1989| publisher=Berg | isbn=0854960198| location=Oxford| page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Theophile Gautier described the "delicate and tender charm" of her performance. It played for 150 performances, plus a command performance at the [[Tuileries Palace]] for Napoleon III and his court. Afterwards, the Emperor sent her a brooch with his initials written in diamonds.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=64}}

In her memoirs, she wrote of her time at the Odéon: "It was the theater that I loved the most, and that I only left with regret. We all loved each other. Everyone was gay. The theater was a like a continuation of school. All the young came there... I remember my few months at the Comédie Française. That little world was stiff, gossipy, jealous. I remember my few months at the Gymnase. There they talked only about dresses and hats, and chattered about a hundred things that had nothing to do with art. At the Odéon, I was happy. We thought only of putting on plays. We rehearsed mornings, afternoons, all the time. I adored that." Bernhardt lived with her longtime friend and assistant Madame Guerard and her son in a small cottage in the suburb of [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy|Auteuil]], and drove herself to the theater in a small carriage. She developed a close friendship with the writer [[George Sand]], and performed in two plays that she authored.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=156}} She received celebrities in her dressing room, including [[Gustave Flaubert]] and [[Leon Gambetta]]. In 1869, as she became more prosperous, she moved to a larger seven-room apartment at 16 rue Auber in the center of Paris. Her mother began to visit her for the first time in years, and her grandmother, a strict Orthodox Jew, moved into the apartment to take care of Maurice. Bernhardt added a maid and a cook to her household, as well as the beginning of a collection of animals; she had one or two dogs with her at all times, and two turtles moved freely around the apartment.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=60–61}}

In 1868, a fire completely destroyed her apartment, along with all of her belongings. She had neglected to purchase insurance. The brooch presented to her by the Emperor and her pearls melted, as did the tiara presented by one of her lovers, Khalid Bey. She found the diamonds in the ashes, and the managers of the Odeon organized a benefit performance. The most famous soprano of the time, [[Adelina Patti]], performed for free. In addition, the grandmother of her father donated 120,000 francs. Bernhardt was able to buy an even larger residence, with two salons and a large dining room, at 4 rue de Rome.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=72–73}}

===Wartime service at the Odéon (1870–1871)===
The outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] abruptly interrupted her theatrical career. The news of the defeat of the French Army, the surrender of Napoleon III at Sedan, and the proclamation of the [[Third French Republic]] on 4 September 1870 was followed by a siege of the city by the Prussian Army. Paris was cut off from news and from its food supply, and the theaters were closed. Bernhardt took charge of converting the Odéon into a hospital for soldiers wounded in the battles outside the city.{{Sfn|Gold|Fizdale|1991|pages=82–85}} She organized the placement of 32 beds in the lobby and the foyers, brought in her personal chef to prepare soup for the patients, and persuaded her wealthy friends and admirers to donate supplies for the hospital. Besides organizing the hospital, she worked as a nurse, assisting the chief surgeon with amputations and operations.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=79}} When the coal supply of the city ran out, Bernhardt used old scenery, benches, and stage props for fuel to heat the theater.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=75}} In early January 1871, after 16 weeks of the siege, the Germans began to bombard the city with long-range cannons. The patients had to be moved to the cellar, and before long, the hospital was forced to close. Bernhardt arranged for serious cases to be transferred to another military hospital, and she rented an apartment on rue de Provence to house the remaining 20 patients. By the end of the siege, Bernhardt's hospital had cared for more than 150 wounded soldiers, including a young undergraduate from the École Polytechnique, [[Ferdinand Foch]], who later commanded the Allied armies in the [[First World War]].{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=74–78}}

The French government signed an armistice on 19 January 1871, and Bernhardt learned that her son and family had been moved to Hamburg. She went to the new chief executive of the French republic, [[Adolphe Thiers]], and obtained a pass to go to Germany to return them. When she returned to Paris several weeks later, the city was under the rule of the [[Paris Commune]]. She moved again, taking her family to [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. She later returned to her apartment on the rue de Rome in May, after the Commune was defeated by the French Army.

==''Ruy Blas'' and return to the Comédie Française (1872–1878)==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[Tuileries Palace]], city hall of Paris, and many other public buildings had been burned by the Commune or damaged in the fighting, but the Odéon was still intact. Charles-Marie Chilly, the co-director of the Odéon, came to her apartment, where Bernhardt received him reclining on a sofa. He announced that the theater would reopen in October 1871, and he asked her to play the lead in a new play, ''Jean-Marie'' by [[André Theuriet]]. Bernhardt replied that she was finished with the theater and was going to move to Brittany and start a farm. Chilly, who knew Bernhardt's moods well, told her that he understood and accepted her decision, and would give the role to Jane Essler, a rival actress. According to Chilly, Bernhardt immediately jumped up from the sofa and asked when the rehearsals would begin.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=74–78}}

''Jean-Marie'', about a young Breton woman forced by her father to marry an old man she did not love, was another critical and popular success for Bernhardt. The critic Sarcey wrote, "She has the sovereign grace, the penetrating charm, the I don't know what. She is a natural artist, an incomparable artist."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=91}} The directors of the Odéon next decided to stage ''[[Ruy Blas]]'', a play written by Victor Hugo in 1838, with Bernhardt playing the role of the Queen of Spain. Hugo himself attended all the rehearsals. At first, Bernhardt pretended to be indifferent to him, but he gradually won her over and she became a fervent admirer. The play premiered on 16 January 1872. The opening night was attended by the Prince of Wales and by Hugo himself; after the performance, Hugo approached Bernhardt, dropped to one knee, and kissed her hand.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=84–85}}

''Ruy Blas'' played to packed houses. A few months after it opened, Bernhardt received an invitation from [[Emile Perrin]], Director of the Comédie Française, asking if she would return, and offering her 12,000 francs a year, compared with less than 10,000 at the Odéon.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=97}} Bernhardt asked Chilly if he would match the offer, but he refused. Always pressed by her growing expenses and growing household to earn more money, she announced her departure from the Odéon when she finished the run of ''Ruy Blas.'' Chilly responded with a lawsuit, and she was forced to pay 6,000 francs of damages. After the 100th performance of ''Ruy Blas'', Hugo gave a dinner for Bernhardt and her friends, toasting "His adorable Queen and her Golden Voice."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=84–85}}

She formally returned to the Comédie Francaise on 1 October 1872, and quickly took on some of the most famous and demanding roles in French theater. She played Junie in ''Britannicus'' by Jean Racine, the male role of Cherubin in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|The Marriage of Figaro]]'' by [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], and the lead in Voltaire's five-act tragedy [[Zaïre]].{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=98}} In 1873, with just 74 hours to learn the lines and practice the part, she played the lead in Racine's ''[[Phédre]]'', playing opposite the celebrated tragedian, [[Jean Mounet-Sully]], who soon became her lover. The leading French critic Sarcey wrote, "This is nature itself served by marvelous intelligence, by a soul of fire, by the most melodious voice that ever enchanted human ears. This woman plays with her heart, with her entrails."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=104-107}} ''Phédre'' became her most famous classical role, performed over the years around the world, often for audiences who knew little or no French; she made them understand by her voice and gestures.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=17}}

In 1877, she had another success as Dona Sol in ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'', a tragedy written 47 years earlier by Victor Hugo. Her lover in the play was her lover off-stage, as well, Mounet-Sully. Hugo himself was in the audience. The next day, he sent her a note: "Madame, you were great and charming; you moved me, me the old warrior, and, at a certain moment when the public, touched and enchanted by you, applauded, I wept. The tear which you caused me to shed is yours. I place it at your feet." The note was accompanied by a tear-shaped pearl on a gold bracelet.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=328}}

She maintained a highly theatrical lifestyle in her house on the rue de Rome. She kept a satin-lined coffin in her bedroom, and occasionally slept in it or lay in it to study her roles, though, contrary to the popular stories, she never took it with her on her travels. She cared for her younger sister who was ill with tuberculosis, and allowed her to sleep in her own bed, while she slept in the coffin. She posed in it for photographs, adding to the legends she created about herself.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=100}}

Bernhardt repaired her old relationships with the other members of the Comédie Française; she participated in a benefit for Madame Nathalie, the actress she had once slapped. However, she was frequently in conflict with Perrin, the director of the theater. In 1878, during the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Universal Exposition]], she took a flight over Paris with balloonist Pierre Giffard and painter George Clairin, in a balloon decorated with the name of her current character, ''Dona Sol''. An unexpected storm carried the balloon far outside of Paris to a small town. When she returned by train to the city, Perrin was furious; he fined Bernhardt a thousand francs, citing a theater rule which required actors to request permission before they left Paris. Bernhardt refused to pay, and threatened to resign from the Comédie. Perrin recognized that he could not afford to let her go. Perrin and the Minister of Fine Arts arranged a compromise; she withdrew her resignation, and in return was raised to a ''societaire'', the highest rank of the theater.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=115–117&lt;!-- 110? --&gt;}}

==Triumph in London and departure from the Comédie Française (1879–1880)==
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt 1879.jpg|thumb|Sarah Bernhardt in 1879]]
Bernhardt was earning a substantial amount at the theater, but her expenses were even greater. By this time she had eight servants, and she built her first house, an imposing mansion on rue Fortuny, not far from [[Parc Monceau]]. She looked for additional ways to earn money. In June 1879, while the theater of the Comédie Française in Paris was being remodeled, Perrin took the company on tour to London. Shortly before the tour began, a British theater [[impresario]] named Edward Jarrett traveled to Paris and proposed that she give private performances in the homes of wealthy Londoners; the fee she would receive for each performance was greater than her monthly salary with the Comédie.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=118}} When Perrin read in the press about the private performances, he was furious. Furthermore, the Gaiety Theater in London demanded that Bernhardt star in the opening performance, contrary to the traditions of Comédie Française, where roles were assigned by seniority, and the idea of stardom was scorned. When Perrin protested, saying that Bernhardt was only 10th or 11th in seniority, the Gaiety manager threatened to cancel the performance; Perrin had to give in. He scheduled Bernhardt to perform one act of ''Phédre'' on the opening night, between two traditional French comedies, ''Le Misanthrope'' and ''Les Précieuses''.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=118–20}}

On 4 June 1879, just before the opening curtain of her premiere in ''Phédre,'' she suffered an attack of stage fright. She wrote later that she also pitched her voice too high, and was unable to lower it.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|pages=351–353}} Nonetheless, the performance was a triumph. Though a majority of the audience could not understand Racine's classical French, she captivated them with her voice and gestures; one member of the audience, Sir George Arthur, wrote that "she set every nerve and fiber in their bodies throbbing and held them spellbound."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=128}} In addition to her performances of ''Zaire'', ''Phédre'', ''Hernani'', and other plays with her troupe, she gave the private recitals in the homes of British aristocrats arranged by Jarrett, who also arranged an exhibition of her sculptures and paintings in [[Piccadilly]], which was attended by both the prince of Wales and Prime Minister Gladstone. While in London, she added to her personal menagerie of animals. In London, she purchased three dogs, a parrot, and a monkey, and made a side trip to Liverpool, where she purchased a cheetah, a parrot, and a wolfhound and received a gift of six chameleons, which she kept in her rented house on Chester Square, and then took back to Paris.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=130–133}}

Back in Paris, she was increasingly discontented with Perrin and the management of the Comédie Française. He insisted that she perform the lead in a new play, ''L'Aventurière'' by [[Emile Augier]], a play which she thought was mediocre. When she rehearsed the play without enthusiasm, and frequently forgot her lines, she was criticized by the playwright. She responded, "I know I'm bad, but not as bad as your lines." The play went ahead, but was a failure. She wrote immediately to Perrin, "You forced me to play when I was not ready... what I foresaw came to pass... this is my first failure at the Comédie and my last." She sent a resignation letter to Perrin, made copies, and sent them to the major newspapers. Perrin sued her for breach of contract; the court ordered her to pay 100,000 francs, plus interest, and she lost her accrued pension of 43,000 francs.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=144}} She did not settle the debt until 1900. Later, however, when the Comédie Française theater was nearly destroyed by fire, she allowed her old troupe to use her own theater.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=142}}

==''La Dame aux Camélias'' and first American tour (1880–1881)==
[[File:SarahBernhardt alsKameliendame1881.jpg|thumb|''[[La Dame aux Camelias]]'' (1881)]]

In April 1880, as soon as he learned Bernhardt had resigned from the Comédie Française, the impresario Edward Jarrett hurried to Paris and proposed that she make a theatrical tour of England and then the United States. She could select her repertoire and the cast. She would receive 5,000 francs per performance, plus 15% of any earnings over 15,0000 franca,  plus all of her expenses, plus an account in her name for 100,000 francs, the amount she owed to the Comédie Française. She accepted immediately.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=148–149}}

Now on her own, Bernhardt first assembled and tried out her new troupe at the Théâtre de la Gaîté-Lyrique in Paris. She performed for the first time ''[[La Dame aux Camélias]]'', by Alexandre Dumas, ''fils''. She did not create the role; the play had first been performed by Eugénie Dochein in 1852, but it quickly became her most performed and most famous role. She played the role more than a thousand times, and acted regularly and successfully in it until the end of her life. Audiences were often in tears during her famous death scene at the end.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=146–147}}

She could not perform ''La Dame aux Camélias'' on a London stage because of British censorship laws; instead, she put on four of her proven successes, including ''Hernani'' and ''Phèdre'', plus four new roles, including ''[[Adrienne Lecouvreur]]'' by [[Eugène Scribe]] and the drawing-room comedy ''Frou-frou'' by Meilhac-Halévy, both of which were highly successful on the London stage.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=150}} In six of the eight plays in her repertoire, she died dramatically in the final act. When she returned to Paris from London, the Comédie Française asked her to come back, but she refused their offer, explaining that she was making far more money on her own. Instead, she took her new company and new plays on tour to Brussels and Copenhagen, and then on a tour of French provincial cities.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=142–145}}

She and her troupe departed from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November, she performed Scribe's ''Adrienne Lecouvreur'' at Booth's Theater before an audience which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, but it was not necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped under her chin, or with her palms on her cheeks, and then suddenly stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=163}}

Bernhardt's first American tour carried her to 157 performances in 51 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name|9688|Sarah Bernhardt}}&lt;/ref&gt; She traveled on a special train with her own luxurious palace car, which carried her two maids, two cooks, a waiter, her maitre d'hôtel, and her personal assistant, Madame Guérard. It also carried an actor named Édouard Angelo whom she had selected to serve as her leading man, and, according to most accounts, her lover during the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silverthorne |first=Elizabeth |title=Sarah Bernhardt |series=Women in the Arts series |year=2003 |publisher=Chelsea House |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-7910-7458-7 |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=159}} From New York, she made a side trip to [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]], where she met [[Thomas Edison]], who made a brief recording of her reciting a verse from ''Phèdre'' {{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=166}} She crisscrossed the United States and Canada from Montreal and Toronto to Saint Louis and New Orleans, usually performing each evening, and departing immediately after the performance. She gave countless press interviews and in Boston posed for photos on the back of a dead whale. She was condemned as immoral by the Bishop of Montreal and by the [[Methodist]] press, which only increased ticket sales.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=166}} She performed ''Phèdre'' six times and ''La Dame Aux Camilias'' (which Jarrett had renamed "Camille" to make it easier for Americans to pronounce) 65 times. On 3 May 1881, she gave her final performance of ''Camelias'' in New York. Throughout her life, she always insisted on being paid in cash. When Bernhardt returned to France, she brought with her a chest filled with $194,000 in gold coins {{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=188–196}} She described the result of her trip to her friends: "I crossed the oceans, carrying my dream of art in myself, and the genius of my nation triumphed. I planted the French verb in the heart of a foreign literature, and it is that of which I am most proud."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=174}}

==Return to Paris, European tour, ''Fédora'' to ''Theodora'' (1881–1886)==
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt - Foedora.png|thumb|As ''Fédora'' by [[Victorien Sardou]] (1882)]]

No crowd greeted Bernhardt when she returned to Paris on 5 May 1881, and theater managers offered no new roles; the Paris press ignored her tour, and much of the Paris theater world resented her leaving the most prestigious national theater to earn a fortune abroad.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=198–99}} When no new plays or offers appeared, she went to London for a successful three-week run at the Gaiety Theater. This London tour included the first British performance of ''La Dame aux Camelias'' at the Shaftesbury Theater; her friend the Prince of Wales persuaded [[Queen Victoria]] to authorize the performance.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=176}} Many years later, she gave a private performance of the play for the Queen while she was on holiday in Nice.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=105}} When she returned to Paris, Bernhardt contrived to make a surprise performance at the annual 14 July patriotic spectacle at the Paris Opera, which was attended by the President of France, and a houseful of dignitaries and celebrities. She recited the ''Marseillaise'', dressed in a white robe with a tricolor banner, and at the end dramatically waved the French flag. The audience gave her a standing ovation, showered her with flowers, and demanded that she recite the song two more times.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=200–202}}

With her place in the French theater world restored, Bernhardt negotiated a contract to perform at the Vaudeville Theater in Paris for 1500 francs per performance, as well as 25% of the net profit. She also announced that she would not be available to begin until 1882. She departed on a tour of theaters in the French provinces, and then to Italy, Greece, Hungary, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Austria, and Russia. In [[Kiev]] and [[Odessa]], she encountered anti-Semitic crowds who threw stones at her; [[pogroms]] were being conducted, forcing the Jewish population to leave.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=186}} However, in Moscow and St. Petersburg, she performed before Czar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], who broke court protocol and bowed to her. During her tour, she also gave performances for King [[Alfonso XII]] of Spain, and the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]]. The only European country where she refused to play was Germany, due to the German annexation of French territory after the 1870 Franco-Prussian War.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=206–208}} Just before the tour began, she met [[Jacques Damala]], who went with her as leading man and then, for eight months, became her first and only husband. {{See below|1=Personal life}}
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt as Theodora by Nadar.jpg|thumb|left|''Theodora'', photo by Nadar (1884)]]

When she returned to Paris, she was offered a new role in ''[[Fédora]]'', a melodrama written for her by [[Victorien Sardou]]. It opened on 12 December 1882, with her husband Damala as the male lead, and received good reviews. Critic Maurice Baring wrote, "a secret atmosphere emanated from her, an aroma, an attraction, which was at once exotic and cerebral... She literally hypnotized her audience."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=218}} Another journalist wrote, "She is incomparable... The extreme love, the extreme agony, the extreme suffering."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=195}} However, the abrupt end of her marriage shortly after the premiere put her back into financial distress. She had leased and refurbished a theater, the Ambigu, specifically to give her husband leading roles, and made her 18-year-old son Maurice, who had no business experience, the manager. ''Fédora'' ran for just 50 performances and lost 400,000 francs. She was forced to give up the Ambigu, and then, in February 1883, to sell her jewelry, her carriages, and her horses at an auction.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=196–197}}

When Damala left, she took on a new leading man and lover, the poet and playwright [[Jean Richepin]], who accompanied her on a quick tour of European cities to help pay off her debts.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967| pages=224–226}} She renewed her relationship with the Prince of Wales, the future King [[Edward VII]].{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=200}} When they returned to Paris, Bernhardt leased the theater of Porte Saint-Martin and starred in a new play by Richepin, ''Nana-Sahib'', a costume drama about love in British India in 1857. The play and Richepin's acting were poor, and it quickly closed.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=202}} Richepin then wrote an adaptation of ''[[MacBeth|Macbeth]]'' in French, with Bernhardt as Lady Macbeth, but it was also a failure. The only person who praised the play was [[Oscar Wilde]], who was then living in Paris. He began writing a play, ''Salomé,'' in French, especially for Bernhardt, though it was quickly banned by British censors and she never performed it.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=228–229}}

Bernhardt then performed a new play by Sardou, ''Theodora'' (1884), a melodrama set in sixth-century [[Byzantium]]. Sardou wrote a nonhistoric but dramatic new death scene for Bernhardt; in his version, the empress was publicly strangled, whereas the historical empress died of cancer. Bernhardt travelled to [[Ravenna]], Italy, to study and sketch the costumes seen in Byzantine mosaic murals, and had them reproduced for her own costumes. The play opened on 26 December 1884 and ran for 300 performances in Paris, and 100 in London, and was a financial success. She was able to pay off most of her debts, and bought a lion cub, which she named Justinian, for her home menagerie.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=210–211}} She also renewed her love affair with her former lead actor, Philippe Garnier.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967| pages=232–233}}

==World tours (1886–1892)==

''Theodora'' was followed by two failures. In 1885, in homage to Victor Hugo, who had died a few months earlier, she staged one of his older plays, ''[[Marion Delorme]]'', written in 1831, but the play was outdated and her role did not give her a chance to show her talents.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=213}} She next put on ''Hamlet'', with her lover Philippe Garnier in the leading role and Bernhardt in the relatively minor role of Ophelia. The critics and audiences were not impressed, and the play was unsuccessful.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=213}} Bernhardt had built up large expenses, which included a 10,000 francs a month allowance paid to her son Maurice, a passionate gambler. Bernhardt was forced to sell her chalet in Saint-Addresse and her mansion on rue Fortuny, and part of her collection of animals. Her impresario, Edouard Jarrett, immediately proposed she make another world tour, this time to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chili, Peru, Panama, Cuba, and Mexico, then on to Texas, New York, England, Ireland, and Scotland. She was on tour for 15 months, from early 1886 until late 1887. On the eve of departure, she told a French reporter: "I passionately love this life of adventures. I detest knowing in advance what they are going to serve at my dinner, and I detest a hundred thousand times more knowing what will happen to me, for better or worse. I adore the unexpected."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=210–211}}

In every city she visited, she was feted and cheered by audiences. The actors Edouard Angelo and Philippe Garnier were her leading men. Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] attended all of her performances in [[Rio de Janeiro]], and presented her with a gold bracelet with diamonds, which was almost immediately stolen from her hotel. The two leading actors both fell ill with [[yellow fever]], and her long-time manager, Edward Jarrett, died of a heart attack. Bernhardt was undaunted, however, and went crocodile hunting at [[Guayaquil]], and also bought more animals for her menagerie. Her performances in every city were sold out, and by the end of the tour, she had earned more than a million francs. The tour allowed her to purchase her final home, a mansion at 56 boulevard Pereire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulevard_Pereire|title=Boulevard Pereire — Wikipédia|author=|date=|website=wikipedia.org|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919151149/https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulevard_Pereire|archivedate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}} which she filled with her paintings, plants, souvenirs, and animals.{{Sfn| Tierchant| 2009| pages=214–216}}
 
From then on, whenever she ran short of money (which generally happened every three or four years), she went on tour, performing both her classics and new plays. In 1888, she toured Italy, Egypt, Turkey, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. She returned to Paris in early 1889 with an enormous owl given to her by the Grand Duke Alexis Alexandrovich, the brother of the Czar.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=226}} Her 1891–92 tour was her most extensive, including much of Europe, Russia, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Samoa. Her personal luggage consisted of 45 costume crates for her 15 different productions, and 75 crates for her off-stage clothing, including her 250 pairs of shoes. She carried a trunk for her perfumes, cosmetics and makeup, and another for her sheets and tablecloths and her five pillows. After the tour, she brought back a trunk filled with 3,500,000 francs, but she also suffered a painful injury to her knee when she leaped off the parapet of the Castello Sant' Angelo in ''La Tosca''. The mattress on which she was supposed to land was misplaced, and she landed on the boards.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=248}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

When Bernhardt returned from her 1886–1887 tour, she received a new invitation to return to the Comédie Française. The theater management was willing to forget the conflict of her two previous periods there, and offered a payment of 150,000 francs a year. The money appealed to her, and she began negotiations. However, the senior members of the company protested the high salary offered, and conservative defenders of the more traditional theater also complained; one anti-Bernhardt critic, Albert Delpit of ''Le Gaulois'', wrote, "Madame Sarah Bernhardt is forty-three; she can no longer be useful to the Comédie. Moreover, what roles could she have? I can only imagine that she could play mothers..." Bernhardt was deeply offended and immediately broke off negotiations.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=222}} She turned once again to Sardou, who had written a new play for her, ''La Tosca'', which featured a prolonged and extremely dramatic death scene at the end. The play was staged at the Porte Saint-Martin Theater, opening on 24 November 1887. It was extremely popular, and critically acclaimed. Bernhardt played the role for 29 consecutive sold-out performances. The success of the play allowed Bernhardt to buy a new pet lion for her household menagerie. She named him Scarpia, after the villain of ''La Tosca''.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=222}} The play inspired [[Giacomo Puccini]] to write one of his most famous operas, ''[[Tosca]]'' (1900).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tosca|Britannica online, ''Tosca'']{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this success, she acted in several revivals and classics, and many French writers offered her new plays. In 1887, she acted in a stage version of the controversial drama ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' by [[Emile Zola]]. Zola had previously been attacked due to the book's confronting content. Asked why she chose this play, she declared to reporters, "My true country is the free air, and my vocation is art without constraints."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=226}} The play was unsuccessful; it ran for just 38 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gassner |first1=John |last2=Quinn |first2=Edward |title=Readers' Encyclopedia of World Drama |year=1969 |publisher=Dover Publications |page=935}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then performed another traditional melodrama, ''Francillon'' by Alexandre Dumas, ''fils'' in 1888. A short drama she wrote herself, ''L'Aveu'', disappointed both critics and the audience and lasted only 12 performances. She had considerably more success with ''[[Jeanne d'Arc]]'' by the poet [[Jules Barbier]], in which the 45-year-old actress played [[Joan of Arc]], a 19-year-old martyr.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=145}} Barbier had previously written the librettos for some of the most famous French operas of the period, including ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' by [[Charles Gounod]] and ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]'' by [[Jacques Offenbach]]. Her next success was another melodrama by Sardou, ''Cleopatra'', which allowed her to wear elaborate costumes and finished with a memorable [[Death of Cleopatra|death scene]]. For this scene, she kept two live garter snakes, which played the role of the poisonous [[asp (reptile)|asp]] which bites [[Cleopatra]]. For realism, she painted the palms of her hands red, though they could hardly be seen from the audience. "I shall see them," she explained. "If I catch sight of my hand, it will be the hand of Cleopatra."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=148}}

Bernhardt made a two-year world tour (1891–1893) to replenish her finances. Upon returning to Paris, she paid 700,000 francs for the [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]], and from 1893 until 1899, was its artistic director and lead actress. She managed every aspect of the theater, from the finances to the lighting, sets, and costumes, as well as appearing in eight performances a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gottlieb| first=Robert| title=Sarah: The Life of Sarah Bernhardt| year=2010| publisher=Yale University Press| location=London| page=121| isbn= 0300192592}}&lt;/ref&gt; She imposed a rule that women in the audience, no matter how wealthy or famous, had to take off their hats during performances, so the rest of the audience could see, and eliminated the prompter's box from the stage, declaring that actors should know their lines. She abolished in her theater the common practice of hiring ''claqueurs'' in the audience to applaud stars.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=232}} She used the new technology of lithography to produce vivid color posters, and in 1894, she hired Czech artist [[Alphonse Mucha]] to design the first of a series of posters for her play ''Gismonda''. He continued to make posters of her for six years.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=238–39}}

In five years, Bernhardt produced nine plays, three of which were financially successful. The first was a revival of her performance as Phédre, which she took on tour around the world. In 1898, she had another success, in the play ''Lorenzaccio'', playing the male lead role in a Renaissance revenge drama written in 1834 by [[Alfred de Musset]], but never before actually staged. As her biographer [[Cornelia Otis Skinner]] wrote, she did not try to be overly masculine when she performed male roles: "Her male impersonations had the sexless grace of the voices of choirboys, or the not quite real pathos of [[Pierrot]]."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=252}} Anatole France wrote of her performance in ''Lorenzaccio'': "She formed out of her own self a young man melancholic, full of poetry and of truth."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=242}} This was followed by another successful melodrama by Sardou, ''[[Gismonda]]'', one of Bernhardt's few plays not finishing with a dramatic death scene. Her co-star was [[Lucien Guitry]], who also acted as her leading man until the end of her career. Besides Guitry, she shared the stage with Edouard de Max, her leading man in 20 productions, and [[Constant Coquelin]], who frequently toured with her.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=252–254}}

In April 1895, she played the lead role in a romantic and poetic fantasy, ''Princess Lointaine'', by little-known 27-year-old poet [[Edmond Rostand]]. It was not a monetary success and lost 200,000 francs, but it began a long theatrical relationship between Bernhardt and Rostand. Rostand went on to write ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and became one of the most popular French playwrights of the period.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=264}}

In 1898, she performed the female lead in the controversial play ''La Ville Morte'' by the Italian poet and playwright [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]; the play was fiercely attacked by critics because of its theme of incest between brother and sister. Along with Emile Zola and Victorien Sardou, Bernhardt also became an outspoken defender of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish army officer falsely accused of betraying France. The issue divided Parisian society; a conservative newspaper ran the headline, "Sarah Bernhardt has joined the Jews against the Army", and Bernhardt's own son Maurice condemned Dreyfus; he refused to speak to her for a year.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=259–260}}

At the Théâtre de la Renaissance, Bernhardt staged and performed in several modern plays, but she was not a follower of the more natural school of acting that was coming into fashion at the end of the 19th century, preferring a more dramatic expression of emotions. "In the theater," she declared, "the natural is good, but the sublime is even better."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=234}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Despite her successes, her debts continued to mount, reaching two million gold francs by the end of 1898. Bernhardt was forced to give up the Renaissance, and was preparing to go on another world tour when she learned that a much larger Paris theater, the [[Théâtre des Nations]] on [[Place du Châtelet]], was for lease. The theater had 1,700 seats, twice the size of the Renaissance, enabling her to pay off the cost of performances more quickly; it had an enormous stage and backstage, allowing her to present several different plays a week; and since it was originally designed as a concert hall, it had excellent acoustics. On 1 January 1899, she signed a 25-year lease with the City of Paris, though she was already 55 years old.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=277}}

She renamed it the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, and began to renovate it to suit her needs. The facade was lit by 5,700 electric bulbs, 17 arc lights, and 11 projectors.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=278}} She completely redecorated the interior, replacing the red plush and gilt with yellow velvet, brocade, and white woodwork. The lobby was decorated with life-sized portraits of her in her most famous roles, painted by Mucha, [[Louise Abbéma]], and Georges Clairin. Her dressing room was a five-room suite, which, after the success of her Napoleonic play ''L'Aiglon'', was decorated in [[Empire Style]], featuring a marble fireplace with a fire Bernhardt kept burning year round, a huge bathtub that was filled with the flowers she received after each performance, and a dining room fitting 12 people, where she entertained guests after the final curtain.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=262–63}}

Bernhardt opened the theater on 21 January 1899 with a revival of Sardou's ''La Tosca'', which she had first performed in 1887. This was followed by revivals of her other major successes, including ''Phédre'', ''Theodora'', ''Gismonda'', and ''La Dame aux Camélias'', plus Octave Feuillet's ''Dalila'', Gaston de Wailly's ''Patron Bénic'', and Rostand's ''La Samaritaine,'' a poetic retelling of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]]. On 20 May, she premiered one of her most famous roles, playing the titular character of ''Hamlet'' in a prose adaptation which she had commissioned from Eugène Morand and [[Marcel Schwob]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Robert| first=Gottlieb| title=Sarah: The Life of Sarah Bernhardt| year=2010| publisher=Yale University Press| page=142| isbn= 0300192592}}&lt;/ref&gt; She played Hamlet in a manner which was direct, natural, and very feminine.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=260}} Her performance received largely positive reviews in Paris, but mixed reviews in London. The British critic [[Max Beerbohm]] wrote, "the only compliment one can conscientiously pay her is that her Hamlet was, from first to last, a truly ''grand dame''."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=261}}

In 1900, Bernhardt presented ''L'Aiglon'', a new play by Rostand. She played the [[Napoleon I|Duc de Reichstadt]], the son of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], imprisoned by his unloving mother and family until his melancholy death in the [[Schonbrunn Palace]] in Vienna. ''L'Aiglon'' was a verse drama, six acts long. The 56-year-old actress studied the walk and posture of young cavalry officers and had her hair cut short to impersonate the young Duke. The Duke's stage mother, [[Marie-Louise of Austria]], was played by Maria Legault, an actress 14 years younger than Berhnardt. The play ended with a memorable death scene; according to one critic, she died "as dying angels would die if they were allowed to."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=260–261}} The play was extremely successful; it was especially popular with visitors to the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Paris International Exposition]], and ran for nearly a year, with standing-room places selling for as much as 600 gold francs. The play inspired the creation of Bernhardt souvenirs, including statuettes, medallions, fans, perfumes, postcards of her in the role, uniforms and cardboard swords for children, and pastries and cakes; the famed chef [[Escoffier]] added Peach Aiglon with Chantilly Cream to his repertoire of desserts.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=287–288}}

Bernhardt continued to employ Mucha to design her posters, and expanded his work to include theatrical sets, programs, costumes, and jewelry props. His posters became icons of the [[Art Nouveau]] style. To earn more money, Bernhardt set aside a certain number of printed posters of each play to sell to collectors.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=238–39}}{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=239–40}}

==Farewell tours (1901–1913)==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
After her season in Paris, Bernhardt performed ''L'Aiglon'' in London, and then made her sixth tour to the United States. On this tour, she traveled with Constant Coquelin, then the most popular leading man in France. Bernhardt played the secondary role of Roxanne to his [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], a role which he had premiered, and he co-starred with her as Flambeau in ''L'Aiglon'' and as the first grave-digger in ''Hamlet''.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=265–270}}

She also changed, for the first time, her resolution not to perform in Germany or the "occupied territories" of Alsace and Lorraine. In 1902, at the invitation of the French ministry of culture, she took part in the first cultural exchange between Germany and France since the 1870 war. She performed ''L'Aiglon'' 14 times in Germany; [[Kaiser William II]] of Germany attended two performances and hosted a dinner in her honor in Potsdam.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=290–291}}

During her German tour, she began to suffer agonizing pain in her right knee, probably connected with a fall she had suffered on stage during her tour in South America. She was forced to reduce her movements in ''L'Aiglon''. A German doctor recommended that she halt the tour immediately and have surgery, followed by six months of complete immobilization of her leg. Bernhardt promised to see a doctor when she returned to Paris, but continued the tour.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=294–295}}

In 1903, she had another unsuccessful role playing another masculine character in the opera ''[[Werther]]'', a gloomy adaptation of the story by German writer [[Goethe|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. However, she quickly came back with another hit, ''La Sorcière'' by Sardou. She played a Moorish sorceress in love with a Christian Spaniard, leading to her persecution by the church. This story of tolerance, coming soon after the Dreyfus affair, was financially successful, with Bernhardt often giving both a matinee and evening performance.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=294–295}}

Between 1904 and 1906, she appeared in a wide range of parts, including in ''[[Francesca di Rimini]]'' by [[Francis Marion Crawford]], the role of Fanny in ''[[Sappho]]'' by [[Alphonse Daudet]], the magician [[Circe]] in a play by Charles Richet, the part of [[Marie Antoinette]] in the historic drama ''Varennes'' by Lavedan and Lenôtre, the part of the prince-poet Landry in a version of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' by Richepin and [[Henri Cain]], and a new version of the play ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' by [[symbolist]] poet [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], in which she played the male role of Pelléas with the British actress [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]] as Melissande.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=297–298}} She also starred in a new version of ''Adrienne Lecouvreur'', which she wrote herself, different from the earlier version which had been written for her by Scribe. During this time, she wrote a drama, ''Un Coeur d'Homme'', in which she had no part, which was performed at the Théâtre des Arts, but lasted only three performances.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=294}} She also taught acting briefly at the Conservatory, but found the system there too rigid and traditional. Instead, she took aspiring actresses and actors into her company, trained them, and used them as unpaid extras and bit players.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=292}}

[[File:Mme. Sarah Bernhardt in Phédre, Hearst Greek Theatre, May 17, '06, Act 3 LCCN2007663412.tif|thumb|upright=3.0|Bernhardt performing ''Phédre'' at [[Hearst Greek Theatre]] in Berkeley, California (May 1906)]]

Bernhardt made her first American Farewell Tour in 1905–1906, the first of four farewell tours she made to the US, Canada, and Latin America, with her new managers, the Shubert brothers. She attracted controversy and press attention when, during her 1905 visit to Montreal, the Roman Catholic bishop encouraged his followers to throw eggs at Bernhardt, because she portrayed prostitutes as sympathetic characters. The US portion of the tour was complicated due to the Shuberts' competition with the powerful syndicate of theater owners which controlled nearly all the major theaters and opera houses in the United States. The syndicate did not allow outside producers to use their stages. As a result, in Texas and Kansas City, Bernhardt and her company performed under an enormous circus tent, seating 4,500 spectators, and in skating rinks in Atlanta, Savannah, Tampa, and other cities. Her private train took her to Knoxville, Dallas, Denver, Tampa, Chattanooga, and Salt Lake City, then on to the West Coast. She could not play in San Francisco because of the recent [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], but she performed across the bay in the [[Hearst Greek Theatre]] at the University of California at Berkeley, and gave a recital, titled ''A Christmas Night during the Terror'', for inmates at San Quentin penitentiary.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=288–289}}

Her tour continued into South America, where it was marred by a more serious event: at the conclusion of ''La Tosca'' in Rio de Janeiro, she leaped, as always, from the wall of the fortress to plunge to her death in the Tiber. This time, however, the mattress on which she was supposed to land had been positioned incorrectly. She landed on her right knee, which had already been damaged in earlier tours. She fainted and was taken from the theater on a stretcher, but refused to be treated in a local hospital. She later sailed the few hours by ship from Rio to New York. When she arrived, her leg had swollen, and she was immobilized in her hotel for 15 days before returning to France.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=305–306}}

In 1906–1907, the French government finally awarded Bernhardt the Legion of Honor, but only in her role as a theater director, not as an actress. However, the award at that time required a review of the recipients' moral standards, and Bernhardt's behavior was still considered scandalous. Bernhardt ignored the snub and continued to play both inoffensive and controversial characters. In November 1906, she starred in ''La Vierge d'Avila, ou La Courtisan de Dieu'', by [[Catulle Mendes]], playing [[Saint Teresa of Ávila|Saint Theresa]], followed on 27 January 1907 by ''Les Bouffons'', by Miguel Zamocois, in which she played a young and amorous medieval lord.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=308–309}} In 1909, she again played the 19-year-old Joan of Arc in ''Le Procès de Jeanne d'Arc'' by [[Émile Moreau (playwright)|Émile Moreau]]. French newspapers encouraged schoolchildren to view her personification of French patriotism.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=295–96}}

Despite the injury to her leg, she continued to go on tour every summer, when her own theater in Paris was closed. In June 1908, she made a 20-day tour of Britain and Ireland, performing in 16 different cities.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=310}} In 1908–1909, she toured Russia and Poland. Her second American farewell tour (her eighth tour in America) began in late 1910. She took along a new leading man, the Dutch-born [[Lou Tellegen]], a very handsome actor who had served as a model for the sculpture ''Eternal Springtime'' by [[Auguste Rodin]], and who became her co-star for the next two years, as well as her escort to all events, functions, and parties. He was not a particularly good actor, and had a strong Dutch accent, but he was successful in roles such as Hippolyte in ''Phedre'', where he could take off his shirt and show off his physique. In New York, she created yet another scandal when she appeared in the role of [[Judas Iscariot]] in ''Judas'' by the American playwright [[John Wesley De Kay]]. It was performed in New York's Globe Theater for only one night in December 1910 before it was banned by local authorities. It was also banned in Boston and Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Feilitzsch |first=Heribert |year=2012 |title=In Plain Sight: Felix A.

In April 1912, Bernhardt presented a new production in her theater, ''[[Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth]]'', a romantic costume drama by Émile Moreau about [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s romances with [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] and [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Robert Devereux]]. It was lavish and expensive, but was a monetary failure, lasting only 12 performances. Fortunately for Bernhardt, she was able to pay off her debt with the money she received from the American producer [[Adolph Zukor]] for a film version of the play.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=318–319}} {{See below|1=Motion pictures}}

She departed on her third and last farewell tour of the United States in 1913–1914, when she was 69. Her leg had not yet fully healed, and she was unable to perform an entire play, only selected acts. She also separated from her co-star and lover of the time, Lou Tellegen. When the tour ended, he remained in the United States, where he briefly became a silent movie star, while she returned to France in May 1913.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=320}}

==Amputation of leg and wartime performances (1914–1918)==
In December 1913, Bernhardt performed another success with the drama ''Jeanne Doré''. On 16 March, she was made a Chevalier of the [[Legion d'Honneur]]. Despite her successes, she was still short of money. She had made her son Maurice the director of her new theater, and permitted him to use the receipts of the theater to pay his gambling debts, eventually forcing her to pawn some of her jewels to pay her bills.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=314–316}}

In 1914, she went as usual to her holiday home on [[Belle Île|Belle-Île]] with her family and close friends. There, she received the news of the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and the beginning of the [[First World War]]. She hurried back to Paris, which was threatened by an approaching German army. In September, Bernhardt was asked by the Minister of War to move to a safer place. She departed for a villa on the Bay of Arcachon, where her physician discovered that [[gangrene]] had developed on her injured leg. She was transported to Bordeaux, where on 22 February 1915, a surgeon amputated her leg almost to the hip. She refused the idea of an artificial leg, crutches, or a wheelchair, and instead was usually carried in a [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquin]] she designed, supported by two long shafts and carried by two men. She had the chair decorated in the [[Louis Quinze|Louis XV style]], with white sides and gilded trim.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=318–320}}
 
She returned to Paris on 15 October, and, despite the loss of her leg, continued to go on stage at her theater; scenes were arranged so she could be seated, or supported by a prop with her leg hidden. She took part in a patriotic "scenic poem" by Eugène Morand, ''Les Cathédrals'', playing the part of Strasbourg Cathedral; first, while seated, she recited a poem; then she hoisted herself up on her one leg, leaned against the arm of the chair, and declared "Weep, weep, Germany! The German eagle has fallen into the Rhine!"{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=320}}

Bernhardt joined a troupe of famous French actors and traveled to the [[Battle of Verdun]] and the [[Battle of the Argonne]], where she performed for soldiers who were just returned or about to go into battle. Propped on pillows in an armchair, she recited her patriotic speech at Strasbourg Cathedral. Another actress present at the event, Beatrix Dussanne, described her performance: "The miracle again took place; Sarah, old, mutilated, once more illuminated a crowd by the rays of her genius. This fragile creature, ill, wounded and a immobile, could still, through the magic of the spoken word, re-instill heroism in those soldiers weary from battle."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=322}}

She returned to Paris in 1916 and made two short films on patriotic themes, one based on the story of Joan of Arc, the other called ''Mothers of France''. Then she embarked on her final American farewell tour. Despite the threat of German submarines, she crossed the Atlantic and toured the United States, performing in major cities including New York and San Francisco. Bernhardt was diagnosed with [[uremia]], and had to have an emergency kidney operation. She recuperated in Long Beach, California, for several months, writing short stories and novellas for publication in French magazines. In 1918, she returned to New York and boarded a ship to France, landing in Bordeaux on 11 November 1918, the day that the armistice was signed ending the First World War.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=326–327}}

==Final years (1919–1923)==
[[File:Bernhardt later years 2.jpg|thumb|Bernhardt in 1922]]

In 1920, she resumed acting in her theater, usually performing single acts of classics such as Racine's ''Athelee'', which did not require much movement. For her curtain calls, she stood, balancing on one leg and gesturing with one arm. She also starred in a new play, ''Daniel'', written by her grandson-in-law, playwright [[Louis Verneuil]]. She played the male lead role, but appeared in just two acts. She took the play and other famous scenes from her repertory on a European tour and then for her last tour of England, where she gave a special command performance for Queen Mary, followed by a tour of the British provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2011/03/sarah-bernhardt-in-london-the-best-of-samaritans/| title=Sarah Bernhardt in London, best of all possible Samaritans| author=Croxton, Arthur| work=The Fortnightly Review, fortnightlyreview.co.uk| date=26 March 2011| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625060357/http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2011/03/sarah-bernhardt-in-london-the-best-of-samaritans/| archivedate=25 June 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Bernhardt made her last tour of the French provinces, lecturing about theater and reciting the poetry of Rostand. Later that year, she produced a new play by Rostand, ''La Gloire'', and another play by Verneuil, ''Régine Arnaud'' in 1922. She continued to entertain guests at her home. One such guest, French author [[Colette]], described being served coffee by Bernhardt: "The delicate and withered hand offering the brimming cup, the flowery azure of the eyes, so young still in their network of fine lines, the questioning and mocking coquetry of the tilted head, and that indescribable desire to charm, to charm still, to charm right up to the gates of death itself."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=330}}

In 1922, she began rehearsing a new play by [[Sacha Guitry]], called ''Un Sujet de Roman.'' On the night of the dress rehearsal, she collapsed, going into a coma for an hour, then awakened with the words, "when do I go on?" She recuperated for several months, with her condition improving; she began preparing for a new role as Cleopatra in ''Rodogune'' by [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], and agreed to make a new film by Sasha Guitry called ''La Voyante'', for a payment of 10,000 francs a day. She was too weak to travel, so a room in her house on Boulevard Pereire was set up as a film studio, with scenery, lights, and cameras. However, on 21 March 1923, she collapsed again, and never recovered. She died from [[uremia]] on the evening of 26 March 1923. Newspaper reports stated she died "peacefully, without suffering, in the arms of her son".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Mme. Sarah Bernhardt |work=North-China Herald |date=31 March 1923 |page=866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, 30,000 people attended her funeral to pay their respects, and an enormous crowd followed her casket from the Church of Saint-Francoise-de-Sales to [[Pere Lachaise Cemetery]], pausing for a minute of silence outside her theater.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

Bernhardt was one of the first actresses to star in moving pictures. The first projected film was shown by the [[Lumiere brothers]] at the Grand Café in Paris on 28 December 1895. In 1900, the cameraman who had shot the first films for the Lumiere brothers, [[Clément Maurice]], approached Bernhardt and asked her to make a film out of a scene from her stage production of ''Hamlet''. The scene was Prince Hamlet's duel with Laertes, with Bernhardt in the role of Hamlet. Maurice made a phonograph recording at the same time, so the film could be accompanied by sound. The sound of the clashing wooden prop swords was not loud and realistic enough, so Maurice had a stage hand bang pieces of metal together in sync with the sword fight. Maurice's finished two-minute film, ''[[Hamlet (1900 film)|Le Duel d'Hamlet]]'', was presented to the public at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Paris Universal Exposition]] between 14 April and 12 November 1900 in Paul Decauville's program, Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre. This program contained short films of many other famous French theatre stars of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seeing Sarah Bernhardt: Performance and Silent Film|last=Duckett|first=Victoria|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2015|isbn=9780252081163|location=|pages=Chapter 2: Hamlet, A Short Film}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound quality on the disks and the synchronization were very poor, so the system never became a commercial success. Nonetheless, her film is cited as one of the first examples of a sound film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isntlifeterrible.com/labels/film%20preservation.html|title=Filming Shakespeare With And Without Words In Settings Familiar And Unfamiliar|accessdate=18 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030131421/http://www.isntlifeterrible.com/labels/film%20preservation.html |archivedate=30 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight years later, in 1908, Bernhardt made a second motion picture, ''La Tosca''. This was produced by Le Film d’Art and directed by André Calmettes from the play by Victorien Sardou. The film has been lost. Her next film, with her co-star and lover Lou Tellegen, was ''La Dame aux Camelias'', called "Camille". When she performed on this film, Bernhardt changed both the fashion in which she performed, significantly accelerating the speed of her gestural action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seeing Sarah Bernhardt: Performance and Silent Film|last=Duckett|first=Victoria|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2015|isbn=9780252081163|location=|pages=Chapter 7. 'Mothers of France: World War 1, Film, and Propaganda.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a success in the United States, and in France, the young French artist and later screenwriter [[Jean Cocteau]] wrote, "What actress can play a lover better than she does in this film? No one!"{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=318}} Bernhardt received $30,000 for her performance.

Shortly afterwards, she made another film of a scene from her play ''Adrienne Levouvreur'' with Tellegen, in the role of Maurice de Saxe. Then, in 1912, the pioneer American producer [[Adolph Zukor]] came to London and filmed her performing scenes from her stage play ''Queen Elizabeth'' with her lover Tellegen, with Bernhardt in the role of Lord Essex.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=308–310}} To make the film more appealing, Zukor had the film print hand-tinted, making it one of the first color films. ''[[Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth|The Loves of Queen Elizabeth]]'' premiered at the Lyceum Theater in New York City on 12 July 1912, and was a financial success; Zukor invested $18,000 in the film and earned $80,000, enabling him to found the [[Famous Players Film Company]], which later became [[Paramount Pictures]].{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=318–19}} The use of the visual arts–specifically famous c.19 painting–to frame scenes and elaborate narrative action is significant in the work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bernhardt was also the subject and star of two documentaries, including ''Sarah Bernhardt à Belle-Isle'' (1915), a film about her daily life at home. This was one of the earliest films by a celebrity inviting us into the home, and is again significant for the use it makes of contemporary art references in the mis-en-scene of the film.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She also made ''Jeanne Doré'' in 1916. This was produced by Eclipse and directed by Louis Mercanton and René Hervil from the play by Tristan Bernard. In 1917 she made a film called ''Mothers of France'' (''Mères Françaises''). Produced by Eclipse it was directed by Louis Mercanton and René Hervil with a screenplay by Jean Richepin. As Victoria Duckett explains in her book ''Seeing Sarah Bernhardt: Performance and Silent Film'', this film was a propaganda film shot on the front line with the intent to urge America to join the War.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the weeks before her death in 1923, she was preparing to make another motion picture from her own home, ''La Voyante'', directed by Sacha Guitry. She told journalists, "They're paying me ten thousand francs a day, and plan to film for seven days. Make the calculation. These are American rates, and I don't have to cross the Atlantic! At those rates, I'm ready to appear in any films they make."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=350}} However, she died just before the filming began.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=332}}

==Painting and sculpture==
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt in Studio.jpg|thumb|Bernhardt with her bust of [[Medea]] in her sculpture studio in [[Montmartre]] (c. 1878)]]

Bernhardt began painting while she was at the Comédie-Française; since she rarely performed more than twice a week, she wanted a new activity to fill her time. Her paintings were mostly landscapes and seascapes, with many painted at Belle-Île. Her painting teachers were close and lifelong friends Georges Clairin and Louise Abbéma. She exhibited a 2-m-tall canvas, ''The Young Woman and Death'', at the 1878 [[Paris salon|Paris Salon]].{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=115}}

Her passion for sculpture was more serious. Her sculpture teacher was Mathieu-Meusnier, an academic sculptor who specialized in public monuments and sentimental storytelling pieces.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=96}} She quickly picked up the techniques; she exhibited and sold a high-relief plaque of the death of Ophelia and, for the architect [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], she created the allegorical figure of ''Song'' for the group ''Music'' on the facade of the Opera House of [[Monte Carlo]].{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=114}} She also exhibited a group of figures, called ''Après la Tempête'' (''After the Storm''), at the 1876 Paris Salon, receiving an honorable mention. Bernhardt sold the original work, the molds, and signed plaster miniatures, earning more than 10,000 francs.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=114}} The original is now displayed the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]] in Washington, DC. Fifty works by Bernhardt have been documented, of which 25 are known to still exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmwa.org/explore/collection-highlights/18th%E2%80%9319th-century 18th–19th Century | National Museum of Women in the Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121230139/http://nmwa.org/explore/collection-highlights/18th%E2%80%9319th-century |date=21 January 2013 }}.

''Sarah Bernhardt's First American Theatrical Tour 1880–1881''. McFarland. {{ISBN|0786414952}}. p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; She set up a studio at 11 boulevard de Clichy in [[Montmartre]], where she frequently entertained her guests dressed in her sculptor's outfit, including white satin blouse and white silk trousers. Rodin dismissed her sculptures as "old-fashioned tripe", and she was attacked in the press for pursuing an activity inappropriate for an actress. She was defended by Emile Zola, who wrote, "How droll! Not content with finding her thin, or declaring her mad, they want to regulate her daily activities, ... Let a law be passed immediately to prevent the accumulation of talent!"{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=97–98}}

==''The Art of the Theater''==
In her final years, Bernhardt wrote a textbook on the art of acting. She wrote whenever she had time, usually between productions, and when she was on vacation at Belle-Île. After her death, the writer Marcel Berger, her close friend, found the unfinished manuscript among her belongings in her house on boulevard Pereire. He edited the book, and it was published as ''L'Art du Théâtre'' in 1923. An English translation was published in 1925.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|pages=7–11}}

She paid particular attention to the use of the voice, "the instrument the most necessary to the dramatic artist." It was the element, she wrote, which connected the artist with the audience. "The voice must have all the harmonies, ... serious, plaintive, vibrant and metallic." For a voice to be fully complete, she wrote, "It is necessary that it be very slightly nasal. An artist who has a dry voice can never touch the public." She also stressed the importance for artists to train their breathing for long passages. She suggested that an actress should be able to recite the following passage from ''Phédre'' in a single breath:

::Hélas! ils se voyaient avec pleine licence,
::Le ciel de leurs soupirs approuvait l'innocence; 
::Ils suivaient sans remords leur penchant amoureux;
::Tous les jours se levaient clairs et sereins pour eux! {{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|pages=50–51}}

She noted that "the art of our art is not to have it noticed by the public... We must create an atmosphere by our sincerity, so that public, gasping, distracted, should not regain its equilibrium and free will until the fall of the curtain. That which is called the work, in our art, should only be the search for the truth."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|page=65}}

She also insisted that artists should express their emotions clearly without words, using "their eye, their hand, the position of the chest, the tilting of the head... The exterior form of the art is often the entire art; at least, it is that which strikes the audience the most effectively." She encouraged actors to "Work, overexcite your emotional expression, become accustomed to varying your psychological states and translating them... The diction, the way of standing, the look, the gesture are predominant in the development of the career of an artist."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|pages=66–67}}

She explained why she liked to perform male roles: "The roles of men are in general more intellectual than the roles of women... Only the role of Phédre gives me the charm of digging into a heart that is truly anguished... Always, in the theater, the parts played by the men are the best parts. And yet theater is the sole art where women can sometimes be superior to men."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|pages=116–119}}

==Memory and improvisation==
Bernhardt had a remarkable ability to memorize a role quickly. She recounted in ''L'Art du Théâtre'' that "I only have to read a role two or three times and I know it completely; but the day that I stop playing the piece the role escapes me entirely... My memory can't contain several parts at the same time, and it's impossible for me to recite off-hand a tirade from ''Phèdre'' or ''Hamlet''. And yet I can remember the smallest events from my childhood."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|page=31}} She also suffered, particularly early in her career, bouts of memory loss and stage fright. Once, she was seriously ill before a performance of ''L'Etrangére'' at the Gaiety Theater in London, and the doctor gave her a dose of painkiller, either opium or morphine. During the performance, she went on stage, but could not remember what she was supposed to say. She turned to another actress, and announced, "If I made you come here, Madame, it is because I wanted to instruct you in what I want done... I have thought about it, and I do not want to tell you today", then walked offstage. The other actors, astonished, quickly improvised an ending to the scene. After a brief rest, her memory came back, and Bernhardt went back on stage, and completed the play.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|page=31}}

During another performance on her world tour, a backstage door was opened during a performance of ''Phèdre'', and a cold wind blew across the stage as Bernhardt was reciting. Without interrupting her speech, she added "If someone doesn't close that door I will catch pneumonia." The door was closed, and no one in the audience seemed to notice the addition.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|page=31}}

==Critical appraisals==
French drama critics praised Bernhardt's performances; Francisque Sarcey, an influential Paris critic, wrote of her 1871 performance in ''Marie'', "She has a sovereign grace, a penetrating charm, and I don't know what. She is a natural and an incomparable artist."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=91}} Reviewing her performance of ''Ruy Blas'' in 1872, the critic [[Théodore de Banville]] wrote that Bernhardt "declaimed like a bluebird sings, like the wind sighs, like the water murmurs."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=95}} Of the same performance, Sarcey wrote: "She added the music of her voice to the music of the verse. She sang, yes, sang with her melodious voice..."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=95}} 
 
Victor Hugo was a fervent admirer of Bernhardt, praising her "golden voice". Describing her performance in his play, ''Ruy Blas'' in 1872, he wrote in his ''Carnets'', "It is the first time this play has really been played! She is better than an actress, she is a woman. She is adorable; she is better than beautiful, she has the harmonious movements and looks of irresistible seduction."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=95}}
 
Her 1882 performance of ''Fédora'' was described by the French critic [[Maurice Baring]]: "A secret atmosphere emanated from her, an aroma, an attraction which was at once exotic and cerebral... She literally hypnotized the audience", and played "with such tigerish passion and feline seduction which, whether it be good or bad art, nobody has been able to match since."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=216–216}}

In 1884, [[Sigmund Freud]] saw Bernhardt perform ''Theodora'', writing:

{{Block quote|text="I cannot say much for the play, but this Sarah, how she played! From the moment I heard her first lines, pronounced in her vibrant and adorable voice, I had the feeling I had known her for years. None of the lines that she spoke could surprise me; I believed immediately everything that she said. The smallest centimeter of this character was alive and enchanted you. And then, there was the manner she had to flatter, to implore, to embrace. Her incredible positions, the manner in which she keeps silent, but each of her limbs and each of her movements play the role for her! Strange creature! It is easy for me to imagine that she has no need to be any different on the street than she is on the stage!"{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=210}}|sign=|source=}}

She also had her critics, particularly in her later years among the new generation of playwrights who advocated a more naturalistic style of acting. [[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote of the "childishly egotistical character of her acting, which is not the art of making you think more highly or feel more deeply but the art of making you admire her, pity her, champion her, weep with her, laugh at her jokes, follow her fortunes breathlessly and applaud her wildly when the curtain falls... It is the art of fooling you."{{Sfn|Gold|Fizdale|1991}} [[Ivan Turgenev]] wrote: "All she has is a marvelous voice. The rest is cold, false, and affected; the worst kind of repulsive chic Parisienne!"{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=188}}{{Sfn|Gottlieb|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shapiro |first=Leonard |title=Turgenev and his Times |year=1978 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian dramatist [[Anton Chekhov]], then a young medical student, was paying for his studies by writing reviews for a Moscow newspaper. He stated that "We are far from admiring the talent of Sarah Bernhardt. She is a woman who is very intelligent and knows how to produce an effect, who has immense taste, who understands the human heart, but she wanted too much to astonish and overwhelm her audience."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=188}} He wrote that in her roles, "enchantment is smothered in artifice."{{Sfn|Gottlieb|2010}}

Sarah Bernhardt's performances were seen and appraised by many of the leading literary and cultural figures of the late 19th century. [[Mark Twain]] wrote, "There are five kinds of actresses. Bad actresses, fair actresses, good actresses, great actresses, and then there is Sarah Bernhardt." Oscar Wilde called her "the Incomparable One", scattered lilies in her path, and wrote a play in French, ''Salomé'', especially for her; it was banned by British censors before it could be performed.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=122}} Shortly before he died, Wilde wrote: "The three women I have most admired in my life are Sarah Bernhardt, [[Lily Langtry]], and Queen Victoria. I would have married any one of them with pleasure."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=123–124}}

After seeing a performance by Bernhardt in 1903, the British actress [[Ellen Terry]] wrote, "How marvelous Sarah Bernhardt was! She had the transparence of an azalea with even more delicacy, the lightness of a cloud with less thickness. Smoke from a burning paper describes her more nearly."{{sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=298}}

British author [[D.H. Lawrence]] saw Bernhardt perform ''La Dame aux Camelias'' in 1908. Afterward, he wrote to a friend:

{{Quote|text="Sarah was wonderful and terrible. Oh, to see her, and to hear her, a wild creature, a gazelle with a beautiful panther's fascination and fury, laughing in musical French, screaming with true panther cry, sobbing and sighing like a deer sobs, wounded to the death... She is not pretty, her voice is not sweet, but there is the incarnation of wild emotion that we share with all living things..."&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of D.H. Lawrence'', Volume 1, edited by James Boulton, Cambridge University Press  (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

==Personal life==
===Paternity, date of birth, ancestry, name===
The identity of Bernhardt's father is not known for certain. Her original birth certificate was destroyed when the [[Paris Commune]] burned the Hotel de Ville and city archives in May 1871. In her autobiography, ''Ma Double Vie'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2008708|title=Ma double vie : mémoires / de Sarah Bernhardt|first=Sarah (1844–1923) Auteur du texte|last=Bernhardt|date=25 August 2017|publisher=E. Fasquelle|via=gallica.bnf.fr|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807074613/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2008708|archivedate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; she describes meeting her father several times, and writes that his family provided funding for her education, and left a sum of 100,000 francs for her when she came of age.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000}} She said he frequently travelled overseas, and that when she was still a child, he died in Pisa "in unexplained circumstances which remain mysterious."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=67}} In February 1914, she presented a reconstituted birth certificate, which stated that her legitimate father was one Édouard Bernhardt.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=322}} On 21 May 1856, when she was baptized, she was registered as the daughter of "Edouard Bernhardt residing in Le Havre and Judith Van Hard, residing in Paris."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=27}}

A more recent biography by Helene Tierchant (2009) suggests her father may have been a young man named De Morel, whose family members were notable shipowners and merchants in Le Havre. According to Bernhardt's autobiography, her grandmother and uncle in Le Havre provided financial support for her education when she was young, took part in family councils about her future, and later gave her money when her apartment in Paris was destroyed by fire.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000}}

Her date of birth is also uncertain due to the destruction of her birth certificate. She usually gave her birthday as 23 October 1844, and celebrated it on that day. However, the reconstituted birth certificate she presented in 1914 gave the date as 25 October.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=15}}{{sfn|Skinner|1967|page=1}} Other sources give the date 22 October,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/sarah-bernhardt-9210057|title=Sarah Bernhardt|website=Biography.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425092034/http://www.biography.com/people/sarah-bernhardt-9210057|archivedate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or either 22 or 23 October.&lt;ref name="Sarah Bernhardt | French actress | Britannica.com" /&gt;

Bernhardt's mother Judith, or Julie, was born in the early 1820s. She was one of six children, five daughters and one son, of a Dutch-Jewish itinerant eyeglass merchant, Moritz Baruch Bernardt, and a German laundress,{{sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=14}} Sara Hirsch (later known as Janetta Hartog or Jeanne Hard). Judith's mother died in 1829, and five weeks later, her father remarried.{{Sfn|Snel|2007}} His new wife did not get along with the children from his earlier marriage. Judith and two of her sisters, Henriette and Rosine, left home, moved to London briefly, and then settled in Le Havre, on the French coast.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=14}} Henriette married a local in Le Havre, but Julie and Rosine became courtesans, and Julie took the new, more French name of Youle and the more aristocratic-sounding last name of Van Hard. In April 1843, she gave birth to twin girls to a "father unknown." Both girls died in the hospice in Le Havre a month later. The following year, Youle was pregnant again, this time with Sarah. She moved to Paris, to 5 rue de l'École-de-Médicine, where in October 1844, Sarah was born.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=13–15}}

===Lovers and friends===
Early in Bernhardt's career, she had an affair with a Belgian nobleman, Charles-Joseph Eugène Henri Georges Lamoral de Ligne (1837–1914), son of [[Eugène, 8th Prince of Ligne]], with whom she bore her only child, Maurice Bernhardt (1864–1928). Maurice did not become an actor, but worked for most of his life as a manager and agent for various theaters and performers, frequently managing his mother's career in her later years, but rarely with great success. Maurice and his family were usually financially dependent, in full or in part, on his mother until her death. Maurice married a [[Polish people|Polish]] princess, Maria Jablonowska, of the [[Jablonowski|House of Jablonowski]], with whom he had two daughters: Simone, who married Edgar Gross, son of a wealthy Philadelphia soap manufacturer; and Lysiana, who married the playwright Louis Verneuil.

From 1864 to 1866, after Bernhardt left the Comédie-Française, and after Maurice was born, she frequently had trouble finding roles. She often worked as a courtesan, taking wealthy and influential lovers. The French police of the Second Empire kept files on high-level courtesans, including Bernhardt; her file recorded the wide variety of names and titles of her patrons; they included the son of Spanish banker and Marquis [[Alejandro María Aguado, 1st Marquis of the Guadalquivir Marshes|Alexandro María Aguado]]; the industrialist Robert de Brimont; the banker Jacques Stern; and the wealthy Louis-Roger de Cahuzac.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=57}} The list also included [[Khalil Bey]], the Ambassador of the Ottoman Empire to the Second Empire, best known today as the man who commissioned [[Gustave Courbet]] to paint ''[[L'Origine du monde]]'', a detailed painting of a woman's anatomy that was banned until 1995, but now on display at the [[Musee d'Orsay]]. Bernhardt received from him a diadem of pearls and diamonds. She also had affairs with many of her leading men, and with other men more directly useful to her career, including Arsène Houssaye, director of the Théâtre-Lyrique, and the editors of several major newspapers. Many of her early lovers continued to be her friends after the affairs ended.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=58–59}}

During her time at the Odeon, she continued to see her old lovers, as well as new ones including French marshals François-Certain Canrobert and [[Achille Bazaine]], the later a commander of the French army in the Crimean War and in Mexico; and Prince Napoleon, son of Joseph Bonaparte and cousin of French Emperor [[Louis-Napoleon]]. She also had a two-year-long affair with Charles Haas, son of a banker and one of the most celebrated Paris [[dandies]] in the Empire, the model for the character of Swann in the novels by [[Marcel Proust]].{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=71–73}}

Bernhardt took as lovers many of the male leads of her plays, including Mounet-Sully and Lou Tellegen. She possibly had an affair with the Prince of Wales, the future [[Edward VII]], who frequently attended her London and Paris performances and once, as a prank, played the part of a cadaver in one of her plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.com/jesusib/EdwardVII.html| title=Edward VII biography| accessdate=18 October 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525070548/http://www.geocities.com/jesusib/EdwardVII.html | archivedate=25 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was King, he travelled on the royal yacht to visit her at her summer home on Belle-Île.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=273}}

Her last serious love affair was with the Dutch-born actor [[Lou Tellegen]], 37 years her junior, who became her co-star during her second American farewell tour (and eighth American tour) in 1910. He was a very handsome actor who had served as a model for sculpture ''[[Eternal Springtime]]'' by [[Auguste_Rodin|Rodin]]. He had little acting experience, but Bernhardt signed him as a leading man just before she departed on the tour, assigned him a compartment in her private railway car, and took him as her escort to all events, functions, and parties. He was not a particularly good actor, and had a strong Dutch accent, but he was successful in roles, such as Hippolyte in ''Phedre'', where he could take off his shirt. At the end of the American tour they had a dispute and he remained in the United States while she returned to France. At first, he had a successful career in the United States, and married film actress [[Geraldine Farrar]], but when they split up his career plummeted. He committed suicide in 1934.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=310–313}}

Bernhardt's broad circle of friends included the writers [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], his son [[Alexandre Dumas fils|Alexandre Dumas, ''fils'']], [[Emile Zola]], and the artist [[Gustave Doré]]. Her close friends included the painters [[Georges Clairin]] and [[Louise Abbéma]] (1853–1927), a French [[Impressionism|impressionist painter]], some nine years her junior. This relationship was so close, the two women were rumored to be lovers. In 1990, a painting by Abbéma, depicting the two on a boat ride on the lake in the bois de Boulogne, was donated to the Comédie-Française. The accompanying letter stated that the painting was ''"Peint par Louise Abbéma, le jour anniversaire de leur liaison amoureuse"''&lt;ref&gt;Guibert et al. (2000) ''Portrait(s) de Sarah Bernhardt''. Bibliothèque Nationale de France. {{ISBN|2717721134}}&lt;/ref&gt; (loosely translated: "Painted by Louise Abbéma on the anniversary of their love affair") Clairin and Abbéma spent their holidays with Bernhardt and her family at her summer residence at Belle-Île, and remained close with Bernhardt until her death.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=272-274}}

===Marriage with Jacques Damala===
[[File:Damala.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques Damala]] and [[Jane Hading]] in ''Le Maître des Forges'' at the [[Théâtre du Gymnase]], in Marseille (c. 1883)]]

In 1882, in Paris, Bernhardt met a Greek diplomat, Aristide Damala (known in France by his stage name Jacques Damala), who was 11 years her junior, and notorious for his romantic affairs. Bernhardt's biographer described him as "handsome as Adonis, insolent, vain, and altogether despicable."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=208}} His affairs with married women had already led to one suicide and two divorces, and the French government had asked him to leave Paris, transferring him to the Greek Embassy in St. Petersburg. She already had a lover at the time, Philippe Garnier, her leading man, but when she met Damala, she fell in love with him, and insisted that her tour be modified to include a stop in St. Petersburg. Garnier politely stepped aside and let her go to St. Petersburg without him. Arriving in St. Petersburg, Bernhardt invited Damala to give up his diplomatic post to become an actor in her company, as well as her lover, and before long, they decided to marry. During a break in the tour, they were married on 4 April 1882 in London. She told her friends that she married because marriage was the only thing she had never experienced.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=210–213}} Upon returning to Paris, she found a minor role for Damala in ''La Dame aux Camelias'' and a leading role in another play without her, ''Les Meres Ennemies'' by Catulle Mendés. Critics dismissed him as handsome, but without noticeable talent. Damala began taking large quantities of morphine, and following Bernhardt's great success in ''Fedora'', Damala took every opportunity to criticize and humiliate her. She later discovered that he was using the money she gave him to buy presents for other women. In early December 1882, when she confronted him, he declared that he was going to North Africa to join the Foreign Legion, and disappeared.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=208–214}}

[[File:Funerary Portrait of Jacques Damala MET DP224154.jpg|thumb|left|Funerary bust made of Damala by Sarah Bernhnardt (1889)]]
In early 1889, Damala reappeared at Bernhardt's door haggard, ill, and penniless. Bernhardt instantly forgave him, and offered him the role of Armand Duval in a new production of ''Dame aux Camélias'' at the Variétés. They performed together from 18 May until 30 June. He looked exhausted and old, confused his diction, and forgot his lines. The critic for ''Le Rappel'' wrote: "Where is, alas, the handsome Armand Duval who was presented to us for the first time a few years ago at the Gaiéte?" The critic Francisque Sarcey wrote simply, "he makes us feel sick." When his contract ended, he was able to get another contract as an actor at a different theater, and continued to harass Bernhardt. He attended one of her performances sitting in the first row, and made faces at her. Her current lover, Philippe Garnier, saw him and beat him. Later, he entered her house and ravaged the furniture. Bernhardt was a Roman Catholic, and did not want to divorce him.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=224}} He continued to act, sometimes with success, particularly in a play by [[Georges Ohnet]], ''Le Maître des Forges,'' in 1883. However, his morphine addiction continued to worsen. In August 1889, Bernhardt learned that he taken an overdose of morphine in Marseille. She hurried to his bedside and nursed him until he died on 18 August 1889, at the age of 34. He was buried in Athens. Bernhardt sent a bust she had made of him to be placed on his tomb, and when she toured in the Balkans, always made a detour to visit his grave. Until the end of her life, she continued to sign official documents as "Sarah Bernhardt, widow of Damala".{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=202}}

===Belle-Île===
[[File:Belle-Ile fort de Sarah Bernard juillet.jpg|thumb|Bernhardt's converted fort on [[Belle Île|Belle-Île]]]]

After her 1886–87 tour, Bernhardt recuperated on Belle-Île, a small island off the coast of [[Brittany]], 10 miles south of the [[Quiberon]] peninsula. She purchased a ruined 17th-century fortress, located at the end of the island and approached by a drawbridge, and turned it into her vacation retreat. Between 1886 and 1922, she spent nearly every summer, the season when her theater was closed, on Belle-Île. She built bungalows for her son Maurice and her grandchildren, and bungalows with studios for her close friends, the painters Georges Clairin and Louise Abbéma. She also took with her large collection of animals, including several dogs, two horses, a donkey, a hawk given to her by the Russian Grand Duke Alexis, an Andean wildcat, and a boa constrictor she had brought back from her tour of South America. She entertained many visitors at Belle-Île, including King Edward VII, who stopped by the island on a cruise aboard the royal yacht. Always wrapped in white scarves, she played tennis (under house rules that required that she be the winner) and cards, read plays, and created sculptures and ornaments in her studio. When the fishermen of the island suffered a bad season, she organized a benefit performance with leading actors to raise funds for them. She gradually enlarged the estate, purchasing a neighboring hotel and all the land with a view of the property, but in 1922, as her health declined, she abruptly sold it and never returned.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=237–279}} During the Second World War, the Germans occupied the island, and in October 1944, before leaving the island, they dynamited most of the compound. All that remains is the original old fort, and a seat cut into the rock where Bernhardt awaited the boat that took her to the mainland.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=258}}

===Religion===
Bernhardt attended a convent school, where she received her first communion as a Roman Catholic in 1856, and thereafter she was fervently religious. However, she never forgot her Jewish heritage. When asked years later by a reporter if she were a Christian, she replied: "No, I'm a Roman Catholic, and a member of the great Jewish race. I'm waiting until Christians become better."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=13}} She accepted the [[last rites]] shortly before her death.&lt;ref&gt;[[David W. Menefee|Menefee, David W.]] (2003) ''Sarah Bernhardt in the Theater of Films and Sound Recordings''. North Carolina: McFarland. {{ISBN|078641636X}}&lt;/ref&gt; At her request, her [[Funeral Mass]] was celebrated at the church of Saint-François-de-Sales, which she attended when she was in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/464490834|title=Sarah Bernhardt|last=1930–|first=Silverthorne, Elizabeth,|date=2004|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|isbn=9781438124162|location=Philadelphia|oclc=464490834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
After Bernhardt's death, her theater was managed by her son Maurice until his death in 1928. It kept its name until the [[Paris in World War II|occupation of Paris]] by the Germans in World War II,&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, John (1995). "Bernhardt, Sarah" in ''The Cambridge Guide to the Theatre''. Martin Banham (ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|9780521434379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when, because of Bernhardt's Jewish ancestry, the name was changed to Théâtre de la Cité.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the article [[:fr:Théâtre de la Ville|Théâtre de la Ville]] in the French [[:fr:Wikipédia|Wikipédia]] ([http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Théâtre_de_la_Ville&amp;oldid=79700031 version 12 juin 2012 à 11:13]).&lt;/ref&gt; The name was changed back to the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt in 1947, then in 1957 became the Théâtre des Nations. In 1968, it was renamed the Théâtre de la Ville, which is the name it has today.

In 1876, Bernhardt constructed a large town house at 35 rue Fortuny in the 17th arrondissement, not far from Parc Monceau, for her family, servants, and animals. In 1885, when her debts mounted, she sold the house. Once her fortune was replenished by her tours abroad, she bought an even larger house at 56 avenue Pereire in the 17th arrondissement, where she died in 1923. The house was demolished in the 1960s and replaced by a modern apartment building. A plaque on the facade commemorates Bernhardt's earlier residence.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=219}}

In 1960, Bernhardt was inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] with a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] located at 1751 [[Vine Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walkoffame.com/sarah-bernhardt |title=Hollywood Walk of Fame – Sarah Bernhardt |website=walkoffame.com |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=16 November 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116142635/http://www.walkoffame.com/sarah-bernhardt |archivedate=16 November 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Barbara|last=Isenberg|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/sarah-bernhardt|title=Sarah Bernhardt|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=4 December 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725184019/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/sarah-bernhardt/|archivedate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] produced [[Theresa Rebeck]]'s play ''Bernhardt/Hamlet''.  In the play, Rebeck explores the controversy surrounding Bernhardt's decision to play [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]].  The play opened on Broadway in September at the American Airlines Theater for a limited run.  It starred [[Janet McTeer]] as Bernhardt and it was directed by [[Moritz von Stuelpnagel]] . &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/bernhardt-hamlet-518406&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3571">'''Shamstep''' is a Middle-Eastern genre of electronic dance music that combines the traditional forms of [[Dabke]] music with electronic instruments. 'Sham' is the Arabic name for the region of [[Greater Syria]], Syria-Palestine or the [[Levant]]. The term 'Shamstep' was coined by the Jordanian-Palestinian band [[47Soul]] to describe their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/28/from-shamstep-to-drill-the-top-40-newcomers-of-2018|title=From shamstep to drill: the top 40 newcomers of 2018|last=Aroesti|first=Rachel|date=2017-12-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-06-17|last2=Beaumont-Thomas|first2=Ben|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/in-depth/features/palestinian-band-47soul-politics-within-us-1735056104|title=Meet the Palestinian band 47Soul: 'Our message is universal'|work=Middle East Eye|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/99499-47soul-breaking-down-borders-through-music/|title=47Soul: breaking down borders through music|date=2018-03-06|work=The List|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamstep has been described as 'more than just a byword for hipsterfied East-West fusion. In 47Soul's home region, it's becoming part of the soundtrack for Arab youth.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/4x87xp/what-is-shamstep-47soul-interview|title=Is Shamstep a Made-Up Genre For Hipsters—or a Defining Movement of Arab Youth Culture?|date=2016-09-02|work=Thump|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band has stated that it believes the region of Sham is "too divided with borders... In 1947, it was accessible to travel between our little cities...[but] we still see [the region] as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stepfeed.com/levant-band-47soul-will-make-shamstep-happen-3176|title=Levant Band 47Soul Will Make 'ShamStep' Happen|date=2015-03-24|work=StepFeed|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 47 Soul's music is also defined by its fusion with Afro-American styles of music like Hip Hop and Reggae, due to the experiences of band member Walaa Sbeit at university in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.palestinechronicle.com/47soul-shamstep/|title=47Soul: Shamstep - Palestine Chronicle|date=2015-07-04|work=Palestine Chronicle|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other musicians who play similar forms of Dabke using electronic instruments include [[Omar Souleyman]], and Egyptian groups like [[Islam Chipsy]], whose music is seen as part of the Egyptian new wave called  [[Shaabi]] or Electro Shaabi. The website Rhythmpassport.com groups all these forms under the heading 'electro Dabke'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhythmpassport.com/genre/electro-dabke/|title=Electro Dabke {{!}} Genres {{!}} Rhythm Passport|website=Rhythm Passport|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

AlAraby has described 47 Soul's music as a "reinterpretation of traditional Arabic instruments, modal scales and rhythms found in ''chobi'' and ''mijwiz'' wedding music - and paralleled in the Egyptian ''electro-shaabi'' scene"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/society/2017/3/17/big-in-exile-the-sonic-journeys-of-47-soul-1|title=Big in exile: The sonic journeys of 47SOUL|last=Armstrong|first=Martin|work=alaraby|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Shirvanshah's palace mausoleum''' ({{lang-az|Şirvanşahlar sarayı türbəsi}}) or '''tomb of Shirvanshahs’ family''' ({{lang-az|Şirvanşahların ailə türbəsi}}) is a historical monument of the XV century. Locating in [[Old City (Baku)|Old City]], it is a part of [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Palace of the Shirvanshahs complex]]. The mausoleum is one of the three buildings located in courtyard of the complex, the others being [[Palatial mosque in Baku|Shirvanshah's palace mosque]] and [[Shirvanshahs' bath houses|Shirvanshah's palace bath house]].&lt;ref name="icherisheher"&gt;{{cite web|title= Şirvаnşаhlаr türbəsi|url= http://www.icherisheher.gov.az/static,19/lang,az/#monument2|publisher= icherisheher.gov.az|language= az|accessdate= April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument was also registered as a national architectural monument by the decision of the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan|Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] dated August 2, 2001, No. 132.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azərbaycan Respublikası ərazisində dövlət mühafizəsinə götürülmüş daşınmaz tarix və mədəniyyət abidələrinin əhəmiyyət dərəcələrinə görə bölgüsünün təsdiq edilməsi haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikasi Nazirlər Kabinetinin qərarı|url=http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/2847|website=e-qanun.az|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Palacio de los Shirvanshah, Baku, Azerbaiyán, 2016-09-28, DD 26.jpg|thumb|270px|left|&lt;center&gt;Tombs inside of the mausoleum&lt;/center&gt;]]
The inscription on the entrance gives information about the history and architecture of the building. It says: ''“The defender of the religion, the man of the prophet, the great Sultan, [[Khalilullah I|Shirvanshah Khalilullah]], God save his kingdom and reign, he ordered this magnificent tomb for his mother and his seven-year-old son, May Allah have mercy on them, he ordered to build in 839."''&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu126"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt;

In 1954, [[oriental studies|orientalist]] A.A. Alesgerzade read these writings on the [[Portal (architecture)|portal]].&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; The other writings are taken from the Koran. On [[Medallion (architecture)|medallion]], which decorates the portal, there's an inscription, which can be only red with a mirror. It indicates the architect of the monument: ''“Allah, architect Muhammad Ali”''. As it is forbidden for architects to write their names on buildings, they encoded their name with this method.''&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu126"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt;

The use of the mausoleum later as a [[madrasa]] resulted worsening condition of the graves.&lt;ref name="Dadashov21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dadaşov, Useynov|1955|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the archeological excavations carried out in 1947, six tombs were discovered deeper than the floor surface.&lt;ref name="Dadashov21"/&gt;

According to the inscriptions on the entrance, it is clear that the mausoleum was built for the mother and son of [[Khalilullah I|Shirvanshah Khalilullah]]. Nevertheless, there were buried other members of the Shirvanshahs’ family. Stone plaques were discovered under the dismantled floor during the excavations. These plaques were used to cover 7 graves. Only in five graves bone remains were found, although the other two were empty.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu127"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fərhadoğlu|2006|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt;

The historian [[Muhammad Khwandamir|Khwandamir]] of XV century wrote in his work, [[Habib al-Siyar]] that [[Ismail I]], the ruler of [[Safavids]] promised to burn bones of Shirvanshahs family to ash as an insult and to take vengeance of his father and grandfather. During capture of [[Baku]] by Safavids in 1501, two graves were opened and the bones inside were removed. The other five graves weren't touched.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu127"/&gt;

In praises, [[qasida]]s, [[ghazal]]s of the palace poet of Shirvanshahs, [[Badr Shirvani]], the persons buried in the tombs were distinguished and specified. He was one of the most famous poets of [[Shirvan]] in late 14th-early 15th centuries. In his collection of works, Badr indicated names and birth dates of the persons who were buried in the mausoleum.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu127"/&gt;

In the first tomb the son of Shirvanshah Farrukh Yamin of 6–7 years old, was buried.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; There remains hair on the skull and chest of the corpse. During cleaning of the bones remnants of the shroud were determined. According one of the praises, the son of the Shirvanshah (1435–1442) died at the age of seven.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu127"/&gt;

Thinness of the teeth and the bones are the indicators that the second grave belongs to an old woman. In one of the praises, the name of the mother of the Shirvanshah were shown as Bika and it was noted that she was an influential woman who died in 1435–1436 ([[Hijri]] 839).&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu127"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt;

In the third grave Khanika khanim, wife of [[Shahrukh of Shirvan|Shirvanshah Shahrukh]] was buried.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; Badr Shirvani used to note her name in his works.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu128"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fərhadoğlu|2006|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Salah, two years old son of the Shirvanshah was buried in the fourth tomb.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; He lived in 1443–1445 (Hijri 847–849). Inside the grave, glazed ceramics and candelabrum parts.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu128"/&gt;

The fifth tomb belongs to Ibrahim II (1432), who died at the age of 19.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; Silk remnants, blue beads, and a golden pin with a needle with length of 36 cm were found in the grave. On the pin there was a turquoise and six sapphire gems.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu128"/&gt;

On the opposite side of the entrance a large skeleton with a height of 2.10 meters was discoreved. It is that is the grave of [[Khalilullah I]]. A comb and a gold earring was found in the site.&lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu128"/&gt;

==Architectural features==
===General planning and construction===
[[File:Усыпальница матери и сына Хана в разрезе.jpg|230px|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Cross-section of the monument&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:План усыпальницы матери и сына Хана.jpg|180px|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Plan of the mausoleum&lt;/center&gt;]]
The only entrance to the tomb is the portal on the main facade. On the right and left sides of the corridor there are two small rooms. A door is opened to the corridor from each of these rooms. It is supposed that these rooms used to belong to religious figures. Visitors enters the main hall – the crypt from the corridor. The hall is cruciform in the plan. The middle part of it is covered with a stone [[dome]]. The dome is fixed to the roof and stone walls.&lt;ref name="Dadashov20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dadaşov, Useynov|1955|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opposite side of the door, between the branches of the cross there are two small rooms inside the thick stone walls. It is supposed to be used as a cell or warehouse where the tomb items were stored.&lt;ref name="Dadashov19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dadaşov, Useynov|1955|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The external side of the dome covering upper part of the middle of the hall were decorated with glazed tiles. However, those tiles do not currently exist.&lt;ref name="Dadashov20"/&gt;

On the upper part of [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] ornament on the [[stalactite]] dome there is a zone consisting of inscriptions with religious characters, and on the tympanums there are medallions on both sides, which is written internally. To reduce differences with other surrounding ornaments, the letters of the writings were specially scaled and styled. The inscription on the entrance door of the portal shows that the mausoleum was built by Shirvanshah Khalilullah I for his mother and son in Hijri 839 (1435–1436).

Tectonics of architectural volumes dominate the interior. Here appears artistic style of architectural techniques that was implemented by architect Ali.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fətullayev|2013|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decoration of the portal and facade===
The portal repeats composition of Divankhane, which is a part of [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Palace of the Shirvanshahs complex]] but in comparison, it is simply solved. The stalactite dome consists of four stalactites, the side walls are smooth, only tympanums of the arches on the entrance door are with ornaments, and on its upper parts two lines of inscriptions are etched.&lt;ref name="Dadashov19"/&gt;

An hexagonal figure is included in ornaments of the tympanums on the entrance door. Inside of them, the word "Ali" is repeated six times vividly.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; The portal is about half a meter from the wall. In front of this ledge there is a pavement which plays the role of a bench for people, extending all over the main facade and which is inside the portal. This structure is characteristic for the most of the buildings constructed during that era.&lt;ref name="Dadashov19"/&gt;

On the top part of the portal, 92th [[ayah]] of XII [[surah]] of Koran is etched with method of carving: ''“Allah, the greatest, said: "Today Allah will forgive you, for he is the most merciful of all.”'' &lt;ref name="Farhadoghlu126"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fərhadoğlu|2006|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dürer - Das Meerwunder.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Sea Monster'', 25.2 × 18.7 cm]]
'''''The Sea Monster''''' (German: '''''Das Meerwunder''''') is a c. 1498–1500 [[engraving]] by the [[German Renaissance]] master [[Albrecht Dürer]]. It shows a voluptuous naked middle-aged woman riding on the back of a male creature who is half-man, half-fish. The man wears a beard and antlers, while his body is covered in scales.&lt;ref name="JJ"&gt;Jonathan, Jones. "[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/nov/30/art.artsfeatures1 Divine inspiration]". ''The Guardian'', 30 November 2002. Retrieved 2 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The woman has seemingly been snatched and dragged away from the river bank; her companions are shown scrambling out of the water in panic, raising their arms in protest or lying down weeping. The woman wears an extravagant [[Milan]]ese headdress&lt;ref name="CH35"&gt;Campbell Hutchison, 35&lt;/ref&gt; and her mouth is open in a cry as she looks back at her friends in the distance.&lt;ref name="Nürnberg36"&gt;Nürnberg, 36&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the woman's gaze back at the bank and her open mouth, her relaxed [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] like pose suggests that she is not overly concerned with her plight.

For this reason writer Jonathan Jones described the engraving as a "troubling, wondrous image of the erotic",&lt;ref name="JJ" /&gt; while historian Walter L. Strauss notes that her abduction may be a device to legitimise her nudity.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Walter L. "The complete engravings, etchings, and drypoints of Albrecht Dürer". Dover Publications, 1973. {{ISBN|0-486-22851-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fortress is set on the rock high above the river; elements of its structure echo the [[Nuremberg Castle|Kaiserburg]] in [[Nuremberg]].&lt;ref name="CH35" /&gt;

[[File:HerculesHesione.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Heracles]] saves [[Hesione]]. Medieval miniature showing Hercules fighting off a sea-beast]]

This engraving is one of Dürer's early attempts at anatomy and proportion, completed before he was able to arrive at what he saw as the canon of human beauty in his 1504 ''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]''. 
The image can be approximately dated due to a similar nude study held in the [[Albertina, Vienna|Albertina]] in Vienna which Dürer signed and dated 1501.&lt;ref name="Nürnberg36" /&gt; A well regarded Mannerist copy was completed c. 1550 in Germany, which shows the scene in mirror image. The copy is signed ''IoHann Von Essen''.&lt;ref name="Nürnberg36" /&gt;

It is not known which specific classical or contemporary tale Dürer sought to illustrate; he is known to have synthesised different sources and bring motifs together in a single image. The abduction of a woman by a water-god is one of the oldest Greek mythological conceptions and a subject that fascinated men through to the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Brion, 153&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer adds a layer of complexity to the scene in that the woman does not seem too upset at her fate.&lt;ref&gt;Brion, 157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] gave an early description of the work, through a vague description of a picture of a [[nymph]] set in the ancient world. Recent interpretations mention the abduction of [[Scylla]] by the sea demon [[Glaucus]], or the abduction of [[Hesione]] by a monster. Further speculation centres on [[Anna Perenna]], who escapes from Aeneas with the aid of a horned water-god.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Hutchison, 50&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Jane Campbell Hutchison suggests that the Milanese headdress may refer to the [[Lombards|Lombard]] queen Theodelinda, who was also abducted by a sea monster.&lt;ref name="CH35" /&gt; The horned Tritonesque figure echoes a description given by [[Poggio Bracciolini]] of a sea monster that had terrorised the Adriatic coast in the early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Théâtre du Capitole de Toulouse''''' is an [[opera house]] located within the main administration buildings, the [[Capitole de Toulouse|Capitole]], of the city of [[Toulouse]] in south-west [[France]]. It houses an opera company, [[ballet]] company and symphony orchestra, [[Orchestre national du Capitole de Toulouse]]. 

The first performance space, a ''salle du jeu de spectacle'', was created in the building in 1736 by [[Guillaume Cammas]].  Following a period of neglect, the current space was created during the rebuild of 1818.  The theatre suffered fire damage in 1917, but was restored in 1923.  The front of house areas were modernised in 1996.  The current capacity is 1156 seats.

[[Michel Plasson]] was responsible for the artistic direction of the company from 1973. He was followed by [[Jacques Doucet (painter)|Jacques Doucet]] in 1981, by [[Nicolas Joel]] in 1991, and by [[Frédéric Chambert]] in 2009, after Joel's move to the [[Opéra national de Paris]].  Chambert's first season was marked by the use of alternate spaces while the theatre was renovated, and the theatre was re-opened for the beginning of the 2010-11 season.

The opera company is a member of the [[Réunion des Opéras de France]].

Protests during the playing of the [[United States national anthem]] have had many causes, including civil rights, anti-conscription and anti-war, anti-nationalism, and religious reservations. "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" was adopted as the official national anthem by U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931. Before that time, protests also occurred when a number of songs were used as unofficial national anthems, including "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]" and "[[Hail, Columbia]]".

==Early examples==
In 1892, three men, including a friend of [[Ida B. Wells]], were [[lynching|lynched]] by a white mob while in police custody in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in an event known as the [[Peoples Grocery|Peoples Grocery lynching]]. The act sparked a national outcry. At a meeting of one thousand people at Bethel A. M. E. Church, Reverend W. Gaines' call for the crowd to sing the then ''de facto'' national anthem, "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]", but the call was refused, one member of the audience declaring, "I don't want to sing that song until this country is what it claims to be, 'sweet land of liberty'".&lt;ref name=sing/&gt; The Reverend substituted the Civil War-era song about the abolitionist martyr, "[[John Brown's Body]]". Well's husband, [[Ferdinand Lee Barnett (Chicago)|Ferdinand L. Barnett]], closed the meeting appealing for calm and a careful response, but also expressing great frustration and concern that the violence against blacks may one day lead to reprisals.&lt;ref name=sing&gt;Wouldn't Sing America," ''The Evening World'' (New York, New York) March 28, 1892, page 3, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6654115/wouldnt_sing_america_the_evening/, Not Their Country, ''The Decatur Herald'' (Decatur, Illinois) March 29, 1892, page 1, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6657652/not_their_country_the_decatur_herald/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
[[File:Goldman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emma Goldman]] was imprisoned for two years after opposing conscription in the US during World War I.]]
Refusal to stand during the national anthem became a widespread form of protest during [[World War I]]. In some cases, this was related to protest of [[conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;YMCA Boys Force A Slacker to Salute, The St. Louis Star and Times (St. Louis, Missouri) June 1, 1917, page 3, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116016//&lt;/ref&gt; It was also associated with support for [[Socialism]],&lt;ref&gt;Asked to Resign, The Los Angeles Times (Los Angeles, California) October 30, 1917, page 13, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116078/asked_to_resign_the_los_angeles_times/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Men who Sat While Anthem was Played Escape Fines, Jail, The Oregon Daily Journal (Portland, Oregon) June 18, 1918, page 4, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116139//&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolshevism]],&lt;ref&gt;Disturbers Cheer the Bolshevists and Show Contempt For Anthem, Harrisburg Telegraph (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) December 9, 1918, page 16, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116158//&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Communism]]. In one case, supporters of the Communism refused to stand during the song at a trial of [[Emma Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Reds Turned Out at Trial of Emma, The Sun (New York, New York) July 7, 1917, page 4, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116037/reds_turned_out_at_trial_of_emma_the/&lt;/ref&gt; The act of protest was very controversial, and many people were highly offended, so that even accidentally remaining seated could result in violence.&lt;ref&gt;Labor Delegates Strike Man who Spurns Anthem, The St. Louis Star and Times (St. Louis, Missouri) December 10, 1917, page 3, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116113//&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests during the anthem continued after World War I. For example, during the build-up towards [[World War II]], a group of students at [[Haverford College]] in [[Philadelphia]] refused to stand because they felt the custom was leading to "rabid nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Students Refuse to Stand While Anthem is Sung, Wilkes=Barre Evening News (Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania) May 31, 1934, page 21, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116195//&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 in [[Arizona]] a federal judge ruled that members of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] cannot be suspended from school for refusing to stand during the national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;Judge Rules for Religious Sect in Fight Over National Anthem, The San Bernardino County Sun, (San Bernardino, California) August 30, 1963, page 11, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116227//&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s and 1970s==

[[File:Jane Fonda 1975d.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jane Fonda]] at an anti-Vietnam War conference in The Hague in January 1975]]
In the 1960s, refusal to stand during the anthem took place for a number of reasons. In the late 1960s, the protest became increasingly common among athletes and at schools, both as a protest of the [[Vietnam War]] and as a protest of nationalism. In December 1968, Chris Wood, co-captain of the [[Adelbert College]] basketball team was removed from the team for not standing, saying, "We believe in the fellowship of man. We don't believe in nationalism."&lt;ref&gt;Didn't Stand For Anthem, Is Dismissed, El Paso Herald-Post (el Paso, Texas) December 11, 1968, page 24, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116260//&lt;/ref&gt; Five white high school students were suspended in [[Cumberland, Maryland]] in February 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Suspend Students Refusing to Stand for Pledge, Anthem, The Daily Courier (Connellsville, Pennsylvania) February 25, 1970, page 19, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116277//&lt;/ref&gt; A federal judge [[Joseph P. Kinneary]] ordered reinstatement of a pair of students in Columbus, Ohio, saying that forcing anyone to participate in "symbolic patriotic ceremonies" against their will was a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the US Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthem Protest Pair Reinstated, Lubbuck Avalanche-Journal (Lubbock, Texas (July 8, 1970), page 75, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116307/anthem_protest_pair_reinstated_lubbuck/&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1970, [[Kaye Stevens]] refused to sing the national anthem before a [[NFL]] game between the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs]], although she had sung the previous week when the Steelers played the [[New York Jets]]. She said she was protesting the Steelers planned expenditure of $37 million on the new [[Three Rivers Stadium]] when local officials were underfunding treatment for drug users.&lt;ref&gt;Refuses to Sing Anthem, Traverse City Record-Eagle (Traverse City, Michigan) November 14, 1970, page 13, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116365//&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1968 onwards, [[Jimi Hendrix]] performed an instrumental version using feedback, distortion and other effects to deconstruct the music with the sonic images of rockets and bombs. Common interpretations link this to a protest against the [[Vietnam War]], opposed to Hendrix own explanation: "We're all Americans&amp;nbsp;... it was like 'Go America!'...&amp;nbsp;We play it the way the air is in America today. The air is slightly static, see".{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=271}}

[[Donald Sutherland]], [[Gary Goodrow]], [[Peter Boyle]], and [[Jane Fonda]] developed an anti-war comedy show which featured a skit about people refusing to stand during the anthem which toured about 20 cities in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-War Show has SRO Crowd, The Troy Record (Troy, New York) March 15, 1927, page 1, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116407/antiwar_show_has_sro_crowd_the_troy/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil rights movement===
At the same time, Civil Rights became an important cause which led to anthem protests. The [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]] was a political demonstration conducted by [[African-American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] during their medal ceremony at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in the [[Estadio Olímpico Universitario|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Mexico City]]. After having won gold and bronze medals, respectively, in the [[200 metres at the Olympics|200 meter]] running event, they turned on the podium to face their flags, and to hear the American national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]". Each athlete [[Raised fist|raised a black-gloved fist]], and kept them raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist [[Peter Norman]] all wore human rights badges on their jackets. In his autobiography, ''Silent Gesture'', Smith stated that the gesture was not a "[[Black Power]]" salute, but a "human rights salute". The event is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html |work=The Sunday Times |location=London |last=Lewis |first=Richard |date=8 October 2006 |title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[University of Wyoming]] coach [[Lloyd Eaton]] dismissed 14 black football players who requested to wear black armbands to protest the racial slurs they faced during games, particularly against [[BYU]]. When the two teams played in 1971, about 50 students at UW refused to stand during the national anthem and wore black armbands during the game.&lt;ref&gt;Wyoming President Says Black 14 Issues Remain, The Daily Herald (Provo, Utah) October 21, 1971, page 19, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116500//&lt;/ref&gt; Another place where African Americans refused to stand during the anthem in 1971 was at [[Northern Illinois University]] basketball games, which led to widespread criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Banning Anthem Discraceful Action, Belvidere Daily Republican (Belvidere, Illinois) December 20, 1971, page 6, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116534//&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests became widespread, and in some cases, arrangements were made for the anthem to be played before athletes left the locker room. Lew Alcindor, later known as [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], began to refuse to stand at [[UCLA]] basketball games, and in response the anthem was played before the players left the locker room in the UCLA-[[University of Washington]] game.&lt;ref&gt;Walt Brown, Athletes, Celebrities Personal Moments: The 60s and 70s, AuthorHouse, Mar 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The same was done when the five starters of [[Florida State University]]'s basketball team, all African American, played [[Tulane University]] in 1971 in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;FSU Starters Refuse to Stand for Anthem, Albuquerque Journal (Albuquerque, New Mexico) January 14, 1971, page 25, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116445//&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turn of the millennium==
On August 24, 1990, Irish pop singer [[Sinead O'Connor]] threatened to boycott her scheduled performance that night at the [[Garden State Arts Center]] in [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey]], if the U.S. national anthem were played. In her own words, she explained,

{{blockquote|I sincerely harbor no disrespect for America or Americans, but I have a policy of not having any national anthems played before my concerts in any country, including my own, because they have nothing to do with music in general...I am concerned though, because today, we're seeing other artists arrested at their own concerts...There is a disturbing trend towards censorship of music and art in this country and people should be alarmed over that far more than my actions...}}

The Center gave in to her demands, but not without controversy. [[Frank Sinatra]] criticized her the following evening while performing at the same venue, stating that he wished that he could "kick her in the ass." [[New York state]] Senator Nicholas Spano urged people to boycott O'Connor's subsequent show in [[Saratoga, New York|Saratoga]], saying "I'm sure Ms. O'Connor would be the first to complain if someone tried to censor her performance, yet she is trying to censor the national anthem by refusing to perform where it is played."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Legislator Urges Boycott Over Sinead's Anthem Ban|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-28/entertainment/ca-409_1_national-anthem|accessdate=September 28, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=Times Wire Services|publisher=Times-Mirror Co.|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, there was protest in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], when [[Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf]], guard for the [[Denver Nuggets]], refused to stand during the anthem before games in protest of [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic]] rhetoric. He was suspended for his actions and received hostile responses and death threats, but the issue receiving widespread attention.&lt;ref name=Hostile&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/sports/rodriguez-yankees-home-hostile-home.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ref=sports&amp;pagewanted=all Home, Hostile Home], ''[[New York Times]]'' (August 8, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jim Hodges|title=NBA Sits Abdul-Rauf for Stance on Anthem|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-13/sports/sp-46409_1_mahmoud-abdul-rauf|date=March 13, 1996|accessdate=December 6, 2016|work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Sarah J.

In 2003, two women's basketball players, Toni Smith of [[Manhattanville College]] and Deidra Chatman of the [[Virginia Cavaliers women's basketball|University of Virginia]], made headlines for refusing to face the flag during the national anthem. Chatman, a Jehovah's Witness, protested for one game in March 2003 due to her anti-war views in light of the then-current tensions between the U.S. and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reedy|first1=Jim|title=U-Va.

During one of her team's games on February 23, 2003, a fan named Jerry Kiley, a self-described [[Vietnam conflict|Vietnam]] veteran, ran onto the court and confronted her with an American flag, saying, "She has not earned the right to disrespect the flag."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pennington|first1=Bill|title=Player's Protest Over the Flag Divides Fans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/26/sports/college-basketball-player-s-protest-over-the-flag-divides-fans.html|accessdate=September 28, 2017|work=New York Times|publisher=NY Times Company|date=February 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Carlos Delgado]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] [[Major League Baseball]] team decided he would no longer stand during the song, "God Bless America" out of protest at America's wars in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Abrams2013"/&gt;

During 2016, several professional athletes protested [[police brutality]] during the [[United States]] (U.S.) [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]]. The protests began in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) after [[San Francisco 49ers]] [[quarterback]] (QB) [[Colin Kaepernick]] sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third [[National Football League preseason|preseason]] game of [[2016 NFL season|2016]]. Kaepernick also sat during the first two preseason games, but he went unnoticed.&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sandritter|first1=Mark|title=A timeline of Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protest and the NFL players who joined him|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2016/9/11/12869726/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest-seahawks-brandon-marshall-nfl|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests have generated mixed reactions and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues.

Stemming from the Kaepernick controversy, before the beginning of the [[2016 World Cup of Hockey]] tournament in [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]], Team USA coach [[John Tortorella]] told in an interview that if any one of his players were to sit out during the anthem, they would sit on the bench for the entire duration of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/world-cup-of-hockey/tortorella-will-sit-anthem-protests-team-usa/|title=Tortorella 'will sit' any Team USA player who protests anthem - Sportsnet.ca|newspaper=Sportsnet.ca|access-date=2017-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
