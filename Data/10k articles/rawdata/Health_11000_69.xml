[[File:Bord Altranais logo.png|thumb]]
'''An Bord Altranais''' ({{IPA-ga|an̪ˠ bˠoːɾˠd̪ˠ ˈl̪ˠt̪ˠɾˠən̪ˠaʃ}}, meaning "Irish Nursing Board") is the statutory body that regulates the nursing and [[midwifery]] profession in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].  It provides for the registration, control and education of nurses.  It holds a register of nurses and midwives, who having undergone the appropriate education, may practice as such.  It can also remove nurses and midwives from the register if they are proven to be unfit to practice.

'''Anne Hutchison McAllister''' {{post-nominals|unlinked=FRCSLT}} {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (29 November 1892 – 5 April 1983) was a leading Scottish [[speech therapist]] and teacher.

==Life==
McAllister was born in [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]] in Lanarkshire in 1892. Her father Robert Dempster McAllister was married to Anne Huchison McAllister. She took a first and then masters degree (in 1917) at Glasgow University.&lt;ref name="glas"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH3032&amp;type=P|title=University of Glasgow :: Story :: Biography of Anne McAllister|website=www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became a Lecturer in phonetics at [[Stow College]] She became a lecturer at [[Jordanhill College of Education]] and an experienced speech therapist. In 1924 she obtained a B.Ed from her alma mater.&lt;ref name=ok/&gt;  In 1935 she created the ''Glasgow School of Speech Therapy'' and she became its first director. The following year she established speech therapy for children who had undergone surgery to fix [[Cleft lip and cleft palate]]s at Glasgow's [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow|Royal Hospital for Sick Children]]. This was following an invitation by [[Matthew White (surgeon)|Matthew White]] who was the surgeon carrying out the surgery.&lt;ref name=ok/&gt;

In 1937 she published ''Clinical Studies in Speech Therapy'' which described her study of 21,000 children in Dumbartonshire and there speech problems.&lt;ref name=glas/&gt; The survey also presented some advice and McAllister stressed the importance of a dual approach of psychology and reeducation.&lt;ref name="Rumsey2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Rumsey|title=The Stammerer's Choice - A Comparative Survey of Speech Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VyF-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT43|date=16 April 2013|publisher=Read Books Limited|isbn=978-1-4733-8871-0|pages=43–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became a founding fellow of the College of Speech Therapists (now the [[Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists]]) in London in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rcslt.org/honours_roll_call_1945-2016 |title=RCSLT Honours Roll Call |publisher=Royal College of Speech and Lanuage Therapists |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allister was awarded an OBE in 1954. In 1964 she stood down from being the director of the Glasgow School of Speech Therapy.&lt;ref name=glas/&gt;

McAllister died in [[Glasgow]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=ok&gt;Renfrew, C. (2004-09-23). McAllister, Anne Hutchison (1892–1983), speech therapist and teacher. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Atrophic vaginitis''' is [[inflammation of the vagina]] as a result of [[atrophy|tissue thinning]] due to not enough [[estrogen]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferri |first1=Fred F. |title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2017 E-Book: 5 Books in 1 |date=2016 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780323448383 |page=1331 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1331 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms may include [[pain with sex]], vaginal itchiness or dryness, and an [[urge to urinate]] or [[burning with urination]].&lt;ref name=Mayo2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Faubion |first1=SS |last2=Sood |first2=R |last3=Kapoor |first3=E |title=Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause: Management Strategies for the Clinician. |journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings |date=December 2017 |volume=92 |issue=12 |pages=1842–1849 |doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2017.08.019 |pmid=29202940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kim2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=HK |last2=Kang |first2=SY |last3=Chung |first3=YJ |last4=Kim |first4=JH |last5=Kim |first5=MR |title=The Recent Review of the Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause. |journal=Journal of Menopausal Medicine |date=August 2015 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=65–71 |doi=10.6118/jmm.2015.21.2.65 |pmid=26357643|pmc=4561742 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It generally does not resolve without ongoing treatment.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017/&gt; Complications may include [[urinary tract infections]].&lt;ref name=Mayo2017/&gt; 

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The lack of estrogen typically occurs following [[menopause]].&lt;ref name=Mayo2017 /&gt; Other causes may include when [[breastfeeding]] or as a result of specific medications.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017 /&gt; Risk factors include [[smoking]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
Treatment is generally with [[Estrogen (medication)|estrogen cream]] applied to the vagina.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017/&gt; Other measures that may help include [[vaginal lubricant]]s.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017/&gt; It is recommended that soaps and other irritants are avoided.&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; About half of [[Menopause|postmenopausal women]] are affected.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017/&gt; Many however are not being treated.&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; Women often report reduced enjoyment in sex as well as life generally.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017/&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==

After menopause the [[vaginal epithelium]] changes and becomes a few layers thick.&lt;ref name="Knörr"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Karl Knörr, Henriette Knörr-Gärtner, Fritz K. Beller, Christian Lauritzen|Title=Geburtshilfe und Gynäkologie: Physiologie und Pathologie der Reproduktion|Edition=3.|Publisher=Springer|PublicationPlace=Berlin|Year=2013|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;24–25|ISBN=978-3-642-95584-6|Date=   2013|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the signs and symptoms that accompany menopause occur in atrophic vaginitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hyun-Kyung|last2=Kang|first2=So-Yeon|last3=Chung|first3=Youn-Jee|last4=Kim|first4=Jang-Heub|last5=Kim|first5=Mee-Ran|date=2015|title=The Recent Review of the Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause|journal=Journal of Menopausal Medicine|volume=21|issue=2|pages=65–71|doi=10.6118/jmm.2015.21.2.65|issn=2288-6478|pmc=4561742|pmid=26357643|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genitourinary symptoms include

== Diagnosis ==
Since women can have signs and symptoms that could be attributed to other causes, diagnosis is based upon the symptoms that cannot be better accounted for by another diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lab tests usually do not provide information that will aid in diagnosing. A visual exam is useful. The observations of the following may indicate lower estrogen levels: little pubic hair, loss of the labial fat pad, thinning and resorption of the [[labia minora]], and the narrowing of the vaginal opening. An internal exam will reveal the presence of low vaginal muscle tone, the lining of the vagina appears smooth, shiny, pale with loss of folds. The cervical fornices may have disappeared and the [[Cervix (anatomy)|cervix]] can appear flush with the top of the [[vagina]]. Inflammation is apparent when the vaginal lining bleeds easily and appears swollen.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017 /&gt; The vaginal [[pH]] will be measured at 4.5 and higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webmd.com/women/vaginal-wet-mount#1|title=Vaginal Wet Mount|work=WebMD|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
Symptoms of GSM will unlikely be resolved without treatment.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017 /&gt; Women may have many or a few symptoms so treatment is provided that best suits each woman. If other health problems are also present, these can be taken into account when determining the best course of treatment. For those who have symptoms related to sexual activities, a lubricant may be sufficient.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017 /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If both urinary and genital symptoms exist, local, low-dose estrogen therapy can be effective. Those women who are survivors of hormone-sensitive cancer may need to be treated more cautiously.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017 /&gt; Some women can have symptoms that are widespread and may be at risk for osteoporosis. Estrogen and adjuvants may be best.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Topical treatment with estrogen is effective when the symptoms are severe and relieves the disruption in pH to restore the microbiome of the vagina.When symptoms include those related to the urinary system, systematic treatment can be used. Recommendations for the use of the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration  help to prevent adverse endometrial effects.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/877224|title=The Best Treatments for Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause|last=|first=|date=|website=www.medscape.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some treatments have been developed more recently. These include [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]]s, vaginal [[dehydroepiandrosterone]], and [[Laser medicine|laser therapy]]. Other treatments are available without a prescription such as vaginal lubricants and moisturizers. [[Vaginal dilator]]s may be helpful. Since GSM may also cause urinary problems related to pelvic floor dysfunction, a woman may benefit from pelvic floor strengthening exercises. Women and their partners have reported that estrogen therapy resulted in less painful sex, more satisfaction with sex, and an improvement in their sex life.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017 /&gt;

== Epidemiology==

Up to 50% of postmenopausal women have at least some degree of vaginal atrophy. It is likely to be underdiagnosed and undertreated.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017 /&gt;

== Terminology ==
''Vulvovaginal atrophy,'' and ''atrophic vaginitis'' have been the preferred terms for this condition and cluster of symptoms until recently. These terms are now regarded as inaccurate in describing changes to the entire genitourinary system occurring after menopause. The term ''atrophic vaginitis'' suggests that the vagina is inflamed or infected. Though this may be true, inflammation and infection are not the major components of postmenopausal changes to the vagina. The former terms do not describe the negative effects on the lower urinary tract which can be the most troubling symptoms of menopause for women.&lt;ref name=Kim2015 /&gt; Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) was determined to be more accurate than ''vulvovaginal atrophy'' by two professional societies.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017 /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health and the Board of Trustees of The North American Menopause Society&lt;/ref&gt;  The term atrophic vaginitis does not reflect the related changes of the [[labia]], [[clitoris]], vestibule, [[urethra]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Portman|first=D.J.|last2=Gass|first2=M.L.S.|title=Genitourinary syndrome of menopause: New terminology for vulvovaginal atrophy from the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health and The North American Menopause Society|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378512214002424|journal=Maturitas|volume=79|issue=3|pages=349–354|doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2014.07.013|pmid=25179577|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
The FDA has approved the use of lasers in the treatment of many disorders. The treatment of GSM is not specifically mentioned in the list of disorders by the United States' Food and Drug Administration but laser treatments have had success. Larger studies are still needed. The laser treatment works by resurfacing the vaginal [[epithelium]] and activating growth factors that increases blood flow, deposition of collage and the thickness of the vaginal lining. Women treated with laser therapy reported diminished symptoms of dryness, burning, itching, pain during sexual intercourse, and painful urination. Few adverse effects were noted.&lt;ref name=Mayo2017 /&gt;

'''Bikur Cholim Hospital''' ({{lang-he-n|בית החולים ביקור חולים}}) is a 200-bed general hospital in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]] established in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="jpost-gaydamak" /&gt; It is the oldest hospital in the country.

Bikur Cholim is known for its obstetrics and cardiac departments. The hospital also operates a  modern neonatal intensive care unit, a pediatrics department, and bariatric and plastic surgery units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Health/Article.aspx?id=256479 Turning things around at Bikur Cholim]&lt;/ref&gt; Bikur Holim treats some 60,000 patients annually. With 700 administrators, doctors, nurses, technicians and cleaners, it is one of Jerusalem's largest downtown employers. One-third of the doctors are [[Israeli Arab]]s, many of whom choose Bikur Holim for their residencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jewishindependent.ca/Archives/mar11/archives11mar04-03.html |title=A state of critical condition |access-date=2012-04-17 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120906123416/http://www.jewishindependent.ca/Archives/mar11/archives11mar04-03.html |archive-date=2012-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2012 the hospital has been taken over by [[Shaare Zedek Medical Center]] and will continue to function as a branch of Shaare Zedek.

==History==
[[File:Poster 2-1.jpg|thumb|250px|Bikur Cholim neonatal unit by [[Moti Bodek]] Architects]] 
[[File:Bikur Holim Hospital at night.jpg|thumb|250px|Ziv maternity hospital]]
Bikur Cholim opened in a rented building in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] around 1826. In 1843, it had three rooms for patients. It was run by the Bikur Cholim society. After the Mission established a medical facility in the Old City, hoping to attract Jews, the society intensified its activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ybz.org.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/Article_27.2.pdf ביקור חולים פרושים בירושלים, מחברה לבית חולים]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, a building was purchased which soon grew overcrowded. In 1864, another complex of buildings was acquired incorporating treatment rooms, a pharmacy, a hospice for the terminally ill and administrative offices. The Ashkenazi Perushim Hospital, as it was known, became the favorite charity of the British Jewish philanthropist [[Moses Montefiore]], who described the facility in his diary in 1875. The general ward consisted of two rooms, each with eight beds. One room was reserved for men, and the other for women.  In 1893, the hospital cared for 781 patients and treated 12,347 people in its out-patient clinics.&lt;ref name="jewishmag" /&gt;

By 1907, hospitalizations exceeded 1,000 per annum. A decision was reached to build a new hospital outside the walls of the Old City. The cornerstone of the new building was laid in 1912, but construction work was delayed by the outbreak of World War I. 

The building on Chancellor Avenue (now [[Strauss Street]]), just off [[Jaffa Road]], was completed in 1925 and opened its doors to all residents of Jerusalem, Jews and non-Jews. The hospital in the Old City continued to treat the chronically ill until 1947.&lt;ref name="jewishmag" /&gt;

Many of the wounded from the [[1929 Palestine riots]] and [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]] were brought to Bikur Holim. Jewish underground fighters were hospitalized under fictitious names to keep the British mandatory police from finding them. During the War of Independence in 1948, the hospital came under artillery fire from Jordanian guns. [[Hadassah Hospital]] on [[Mount Scopus]] was evacuated, and many patients were transferred to Bikur Holim.&lt;ref name="jewishmag" /&gt;

In 2007, the Russian-Israeli tycoon [[Arkadi Gaydamak]] saved the hospital from bankruptcy, taking it over from receivership. In 2010, Gaydamak stopped funding the hospital and returned to Russia.&lt;ref name="jpost-gaydamak" /&gt;

The location of the hospital in downtown Jerusalem has proven critical in times of emergency. With Jerusalem's other hospitals are located far from the center, Bikur Holim was able to save the lives of many victims of [[Palestinian political violence|terrorist attacks]]. According to the head of the emergency ward, “If somebody’s life is in danger and they need immediate help, realizing that the brain only has six minutes before it’s too late, then 20 minutes is too late. It’s coming dead on arrival." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jewishindependent.ca/Archives/mar11/archives11mar04-03.html |title=A state of critical condition |access-date=2012-04-17 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120906123416/http://www.jewishindependent.ca/Archives/mar11/archives11mar04-03.html |archive-date=2012-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospital's medical director, Raphael Pollack, says its financial difficulties are due to the system of discounts exacted from the hospitals by health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and debt repayment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jewishindependent.ca/Archives/mar11/archives11mar04-03.html |title=A state of critical condition |access-date=2012-04-17 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120906123416/http://www.jewishindependent.ca/Archives/mar11/archives11mar04-03.html |archive-date=2012-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious orientation==
[[File:Bikur Choliem hospital.jpg|thumb|Hospital doors by [[Ze'ev Raban]]]]
Situated near the religious neighborhoods of [[Geula]] and [[Mea Shearim]], Bikur Holim admits a very high percentage of [[Haredi]] Jews, and tries to cater to their needs. [[Shabbat]] is strictly observed. Non-Jewish employees record medical information and answer telephones on the Sabbath. Food is warmed in ovens operated by a timer, in keeping with Orthodox religious rulings.&lt;ref name="jewishmag" /&gt;

==Architecture==
The current building was designed by architect Zvi [[Joseph Barsky]] in the neo-classical style with modernist elements. [[Zeev Raban]] of [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design|Bezalel]] designed the bronze doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bikurholim.org.il/history_e.php |title=History of Bikur Holim |access-date=2009-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017113021/http://www.bikurholim.org.il/history_e.php |archive-date=2009-10-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Arcady Gaydamak bought the hospital for $35 million in 2007, he commissioned plans, designed by the Architect [[Moti Bodek]] to build two hospitalization towers alongside the existing historical structure. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/reaching-new-heights-1.279973 Reaching new heights, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6230">'''[[Capital punishment]] in [[Croatia]]''' existed until 1990 when it was constitutionally abolished. The last execution had taken place under [[Yugoslavia]] in 1987.

[[Hanging]] was replaced by [[firing squad]]s in 1959 in Yugoslavia.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Capital punishment was abolished in [[SR Croatia]] in 1974, but remained legal for federal crimes within [[SFR Yugoslavia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Notable Executions==
In the time of Yugoslavia, several court cases resulted in capital punishment:

* Luka Javorina, chief of a railway station in [[Plavno, Croatia|Plavno]] (on today's [[R103 railway (Croatia)|R103 railway]]), was drunk at work and caused the death of 20 people in a rail disaster of 15 August 1949. He was executed by firing squad on 24 October 1949.&lt;ref name="vjesnik-2005"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[Vjesnik]] | date = 2005-11-26 | title = Smrtna kazna | first = Vanja | last = Majetić | url = http://www.zupsudvu.hr/radovi/izbor_odluka_2005.pdf | pages = 39&amp;ndash;42 | accessdate = 2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kazimir Antić and his brother Ivan conspired to rob the Kremenić family on [[Cres]]. During the robbery, Kazimir Antić murdered Josip Kremenić with a bat, and injured his sister Marija. Antić was sentenced to death on 6 November 1967 and was executed on 6 November 1968.&lt;ref name="vjesnik-2005"/&gt;
* Ferdo Darić murdered an elderly couple, Petar and Bara Biličić, in [[Draganić]], by killing them with an axe in their sleep. The Court in Karlovac had him executed in 1970.&lt;ref name="vjesnik-2005"/&gt;
* Jovan Bugarski went to rob the house of Adela Bašić in [[Samobor]], and slit the throat of both Adela (46) and her daughter Dragica (23) on 26 April 1964. The Court in Zagreb had him executed by firing squad in the fall of 1966, the last such decision for that Court.&lt;ref name="vjesnik-2005"/&gt;
* Nikola Kević was found guilty of a double murder and an attempted murder at the Court in [[Osijek]], with a failed appeal to the [[Supreme Court of Yugoslavia]]. On death row, he was kept in solitary confinement and in chains, before he was executed by firing squad on 22 April 1978.&lt;ref name="vjesnik-2005"/&gt;

The last civilian execution in Croatia was done in 1987,&lt;ref name="jutarnji-2013"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.jutarnji.hr/-karlovacki-monstrum-nije-imao-milosti--nismo-imali-izbora--morali-smo-ga-osuditi-na-strijeljanje-/1116865/ | language = Croatian | newspaper = [[Jutarnji list]] | title = TAJNA POSLJEDNJE SMRTNE KAZNE 'Karlovački monstrum nije imao milosti.

Capital punishment was outlawed by article 21 of the 1990 [[Constitution of Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=2408&amp;sec=729 | title = 2. Personal and Political Liberties and Rights - Article 21 | work = The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (consolidated text) | publisher = [[Croatian Parliament]] | accessdate = 2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatia is a signatory of Protocol 13 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] that abolishes the death penalty in all circumstances. The convention was signed on 3 July 2002, ratified on 3 February 2003, and came into force on 1 July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=25/05/2011&amp;CL=ENG Protocol No. 13 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fever is rare and should raise suspicion for secondary infection. Patients can be lethargic, and might have sunken eyes, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, or wrinkled hands and feet. [[Kussmaul breathing]], a deep and labored breathing pattern, can occur because of [[acidosis]] from [[Human feces|stool]] [[bicarbonate]] losses and [[lactic acidosis]] associated with poor [[perfusion]]. [[Blood pressure]] drops due to dehydration, peripheral pulse is rapid and thready, and urine output decreases with time. Muscle cramping and weakness, altered consciousness, [[seizures]], or even [[coma]] due to [[electrolyte imbalance]]s are common, especially in children.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt;

=== Transmission ===
Cholera has been found in two animal populations: [[shellfish]] and [[plankton]].&lt;ref name="Lancet2004" /&gt;

[[Transmission (medicine)|Transmission]] is usually through the [[fecal-oral route]] of contaminated food or water caused by poor [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name="WHO2010" /&gt; Most cholera cases in developed countries are a result of transmission by food, while in the developing world it is more often water.&lt;ref name="Lancet2004" /&gt; Food transmission can occur when people harvest seafood such as [[oyster]]s in waters infected with [[sewage]], as ''Vibrio cholerae'' accumulates in [[plankton]]ic [[copepod|crustaceans]] and the oysters eat the [[zooplankton]].&lt;ref name="bakerinstitute.org"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://bakerinstitute.org/videos/civic-scientist-lecture-series-rita-colwell-oceans-climate-and-health-cholera-model-infectious-diseases-changing-environment/|title=Oceans, Climate, and Health: Cholera as a Model of Infectious Diseases in a Changing Environment|publisher=James A Baker III Institute for Public Policy|people=[[Rita Colwell]]|accessdate=2013-10-23|location=Rice University|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026030733/http://bakerinstitute.org/videos/civic-scientist-lecture-series-rita-colwell-oceans-climate-and-health-cholera-model-infectious-diseases-changing-environment/|archivedate=2013-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People infected with cholera often have diarrhea, and disease transmission may occur if this highly liquid stool, colloquially referred to as "rice-water", contaminates water used by others.&lt;ref name="Sherris"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sherris Medical Microbiology|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8385-8529-0|edition=4th|pages=376–7|editor1=Ryan KJ |editor2=Ray CG}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A single diarrheal event can cause a one-million fold increase in numbers of ''V. cholerae'' in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/cholera-biology-and-genetics|title=Cholera Biology and Genetics {{!}} NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|website=www.niaid.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The source of the contamination is typically other cholera sufferers when their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to get into waterways, [[groundwater]] or [[drinking water]] supplies. Drinking any contaminated water and eating any foods washed in the water, as well as [[shellfish]] living in the affected [[waterway]], can cause a person to contract an infection. Cholera is rarely [[contagious disease|spread directly from person to person]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

''V. cholerae'' also exists outside the human body in natural water sources, either by itself or through interacting with [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], or [[Biotic material|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] detritus.&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=EJ|last2=Harris|first2=JB|last3=Morris|first3=JG|last4=Calderwood|first4=SB|last5=Camilli|first5=A| title=Cholera transmission: the host, pathogen and bacteriophage dynamic|journal=Nat Rev Microbiol|date=7 October 2009|volume=7|issue=10|pages=693–702|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2204|pmid=19756008|pmc=3842031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drinking such water can also result in the disease, even without prior contamination through fecal matter. Selective pressures exist however in the aquatic environment that may reduce the virulence of ''V. cholerae''.&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review /&gt; Specifically, animal models indicate that the transcriptional profile of the pathogen changes as it prepares to enter an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review /&gt; This transcriptional change results in a loss of ability of ''V. cholerae'' to be cultured on standard media, a phenotype referred to as '[[viable but non-culturable]]' (VBNC) or more conservatively '[[active but non-culturable]]' (ABNC).&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review /&gt; One study indicates that the culturability of ''V. cholerae'' drops 90% within 24 hours of entering the water, and furthermore that this loss in culturability is associated with a loss in virulence.&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review /&gt;&lt;ref name=NEJOct2008plos&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson |first1=EJ |last2=Chowdhury |first2=A |last3=Flynn |first3=J |last4=Schild |first4=Stefan |last5=Bourassa |first5=L |last6=Shao |first6=Yue |last7=LaRocque|first7=RC|last8=Calderwood|first8=SB|last9=Qadri|first9=F|last10=Camilli|first10=A| title=Transmission of ''Vibrio cholerae'' Is Antagonized by Lytic Phage and Entry into the Aquatic Environment|journal=PLoS Pathog|date=24 October 2008|volume=4|issue=10|pages=e1000187|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000187|pmid=18949027|pmc=2563029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Susceptibility ===
About 100{{nbsp}}million bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in a normal healthy adult.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt; This dose, however, is less in those with lowered [[gastric acid]]ity (for instance those using [[proton pump inhibitors]]).&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt; Children are also more susceptible, with two- to four-year-olds having the highest rates of infection.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt; Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their [[blood type]], with those with [[type O blood]] being the most susceptible.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt; Persons with [[immunodeficiency|lowered immunity]], such as persons with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] or [[malnutrition|malnourished]] children, are more likely to experience a severe case if they become infected.&lt;ref name=WHOpreventionandcontrolofoutbreaks&gt;[http://www.emro.who.int/csr/Media/PDF/cholera_whopolicy.pdf Prevention and control of cholera outbreaks: WHO policy and recommendations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122092541/http://www.emro.who.int/csr/Media/PDF/cholera_whopolicy.pdf |date=2011-11-22 }}, World Health Organization, Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, undated but citing sources from '07, '04, '03, '04, and '05.&lt;/ref&gt; Any individual, even a healthy adult in middle age, can experience a severe case, and each person's case should be measured by the loss of fluids, preferably in consultation with a professional [[health care provider]].{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

The [[cystic fibrosis]] genetic [[mutation]] known as [[delta-F508]] in humans has been said to maintain a selective [[heterozygous advantage]]: [[heterozygous]] carriers of the mutation (who are thus not affected by cystic fibrosis) are more resistant to ''V. cholerae'' infections.&lt;ref name="Bertranpetit_1996"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1996|title=Genetic and geographical variability in cystic fibrosis: evolutionary considerations|journal=Ciba Found. Symp.|volume=197|issue=|pages=97–114; discussion 114–8|pmid=8827370|vauthors=Bertranpetit J, Calafell F }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the genetic deficiency in the [[cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]] channel proteins interferes with bacteria binding to the [[intestinal epithelium]], thus reducing the effects of an infection.

== Mechanism ==
[[File:Cholera role of biofilm in intestinal colonization.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The role of [[biofilm]] in the intestinal colonization of ''Vibrio cholerae''.]]
When consumed, most bacteria do not survive the [[Gastric acid|acidic]] conditions of the [[stomach|human stomach]].&lt;ref name="BliskaAlmagro-Moreno2015" /&gt; The few surviving bacteria conserve their energy and stored [[nutrient]]s during the passage through the stomach by shutting down [[protein]] production. When the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the [[small intestine]], they must propel themselves through the thick [[Mucus#Digestive system|mucus]] that lines the small intestine to reach the intestinal walls where they can attach and thrive.&lt;ref name="BliskaAlmagro-Moreno2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Almagro-Moreno|first1=S|last2=Pruss|first2=K|last3=Taylor|first3=RK|title=Intestinal Colonization Dynamics of Vibrio cholerae.|journal=PLOS Pathog.|date=May 2015|volume=11|issue=5|pages=e1004787|pmid=25996593|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004787|pmc=4440752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, they no longer need the [[flagellum|flagella]] to move. The bacteria stop producing the protein [[flagellin]] to conserve energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins which they express in response to the changed chemical surroundings. On reaching the intestinal wall, ''V. cholerae'' start producing the [[exotoxin|toxic proteins]] that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of ''V. cholerae'' bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

The [[cholera toxin]] (CTX or CT) is an [[oligomer]]ic complex made up of six [[protein subunit]]s: a single copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), connected by a [[disulfide bond]]. The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to [[GM1]] [[ganglioside]]s on the surface of the intestinal epithelium cells. The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that [[ADP-ribosylation|ADP-ribosylates]] [[G protein]]s, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring. Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]]. Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called [[ADP-ribosylation factor 6]] (Arf6).&lt;ref name=O&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Neal CJ, Jobling MG, Holmes RK, Hol WG | title = Structural basis for the activation of cholera toxin by human ARF6-GTP | journal = Science | volume = 309 | issue = 5737 | pages = 1093–6 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16099990 | doi = 10.1126/science.1113398 | ref = harv | bibcode = 2005Sci...309.1093O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the [[Gs alpha subunit]] of the [[heterotrimeric G protein]]. This results in constitutive [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] production, which in turn leads to the secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into ''V. cholerae'' by [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Virulent strains of ''V. cholerae'' carry a variant of a [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate]] [[bacteriophage]] called [[CTXφ Bacteriophage|CTXφ]].

Microbiologists have studied the [[gene expression|genetic mechanisms]] by which the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall.&lt;ref name="DiRita"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DiRita VJ, Parsot C, Jander G, Mekalanos JJ | title = Regulatory cascade controls virulence in Vibrio cholerae | journal = Proc.

The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six liters of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated unless an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is taken to replace the blood's water and salts lost in the diarrhea.{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

By inserting separate, successive sections of ''V. cholerae'' DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which ''V. cholerae'' responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered a complex cascade of regulatory proteins controls expression of ''V. cholerae'' [[virulence]] determinants.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}} In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH proteins, which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of [[virulence]] genes that produce the toxins, causing diarrhea in the infected person and allowing the bacteria to colonize the intestine.&lt;ref name="DiRita" /&gt; Current{{when|date=August 2017}} research aims at discovering "the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine."&lt;ref name="DiRita" /&gt;

=== Genetic structure ===
{{Main|Vibrio cholerae}}
[[Amplified fragment length polymorphism]] [[DNA profiling|fingerprinting]] of the pandemic [[genetic isolate|isolates]] of ''V. cholerae'' has revealed variation in the genetic structure. Two [[gene cluster|clusters]] have been identified: Cluster I and Cluster II. For the most part, Cluster I consists of strains from the 1960s and 1970s, while Cluster II largely contains strains from the 1980s and 1990s, based on the change in the clone structure. This grouping of strains is best seen in the strains from the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=December 2013}} {{cite journal |vauthors=Lan R, Reeves PR | title = Pandemic Spread of Cholera: Genetic Diversity and Relationships within the Seventh Pandemic Clone of Vibrio cholerae Determined by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism | journal = J.

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
In many areas of the world, [[antibiotic resistance]] is increasing within cholera bacteria. In [[Bangladesh]], for example, most cases are resistant to [[tetracycline]], [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]], and [[erythromycin]].&lt;ref name="NEJM2006" /&gt; Rapid diagnostic [[assay]] methods are available for the identification of [[multiple drug resistance|multi-drug resistant]] cases.&lt;ref name="Mackay"&gt;{{cite book|title=Real-Time PCR in microbiology: From diagnosis to characterization|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-904455-18-9|editor=Mackay IM}}&lt;/ref&gt; New generation antimicrobials have been discovered which are effective against cholera bacteria in ''in vitro'' studies.&lt;ref name="Ramamurthy"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vibrio cholerae: Genomics and molecular biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-904455-33-2|chapter=Antibiotic resistance in ''Vibrio cholerae''|author=Ramamurthy T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
A rapid [[dipstick]] test is available to determine the presence of ''V. cholerae''.&lt;ref name="NEJM2006" /&gt; In those samples that test positive, further testing should be done to determine antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref name="NEJM2006" /&gt; In [[epidemic]] situations, a clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a [[medical history|patient history]] and doing a brief examination. Treatment is usually started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis.

Stool and swab samples collected in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is ''V. cholerae'' O1. If ''V. cholerae'' [[serotype|serogroup]] O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for ''V. cholerae'' O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, it is necessary to send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.

Infection with ''V. cholerae'' O139 should be reported and handled in the same manner as that caused by ''V. cholerae'' O1. The associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported in the United States.&lt;ref name="CDC_Diag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/pdf/Laboratory-Methods-for-the-Diagnosis-of-Epidemic-Dysentery-and-Cholera.pdf|title=Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Epidemic Dysentery and Cholera|year=1999|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2017-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623024004/https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/pdf/laboratory-methods-for-the-diagnosis-of-epidemic-dysentery-and-cholera.pdf|archivedate=2017-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends focusing on prevention, preparedness, and response to combat the spread of cholera.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;"Cholera Fact Sheet", World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs107/en/index.html who.int] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505185900/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs107/en/index.html |date=2012-05-05 }}.

Although cholera may be life-threatening, prevention of the disease is normally straightforward if proper [[sanitation]] practices are followed. In [[developed countries]], due to nearly universal advanced [[water treatment]] and sanitation practices present there, cholera is rare.

Effective sanitation practices, if instituted and adhered to in time, are usually sufficient to stop an epidemic. There are several points along the cholera transmission path at which its spread may be halted:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Sterilization: Proper disposal and treatment of all materials that may have come into contact with cholera victims' feces (e.g., clothing, bedding, etc.) are essential. These should be [[Disinfection|sanitized]] by washing in hot water, using [[chlorine]] [[bleach]] if possible. Hands that touch cholera patients or their clothing, bedding, etc., should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with chlorinated water or other effective antimicrobial agents.
* [[Sewage]] and [[fecal sludge management]]: In cholera-affected areas, sewage and fecal sludge need to be treated and managed carefully in order to stop the spread of this disease via [[human excreta]]. Provision of [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] is an important preventative measure.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt; [[Open defecation]], release of untreated sewage, or dumping of fecal sludge from [[pit latrine]]s or [[septic tank]]s into the environment need to be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ec/books?id=AGQVBeNM_80C&amp;pg=PA5|title=Urban Water Security: Managing Risks: UNESCO-IHP|last=Cisneros|first=Blanca Jimenez|last2=Rose|first2=Joan B.|date=2009-03-24|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-88162-0|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cholera affected zones, there is a low degree of [[sewage treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rd3zCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PA24|title=Cholera and the Ecology of Vibrio cholerae|last=Drasar|first=B.

* Sources: Warnings about possible cholera contamination should be posted around contaminated water sources with directions on how to [[decontamination|decontaminate]] the water (boiling, chlorination etc.) for possible use.
* [[Water purification]]: All water used for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], ozone water treatment, ultraviolet light sterilization (e.g., by [[solar water disinfection]]), or antimicrobial filtration in any area where cholera may be present. Chlorination and boiling are often the least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. [[Cloth filter]]s or [[#Sari filtration|sari filtration]], though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in [[Bangladesh]] that rely on untreated surface water. Better antimicrobial filters, like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits, are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases.

[[Hand washing|Handwashing]] with soap or ash after using a [[toilet]] and before handling food or eating is also recommended for cholera prevention by WHO Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cholera and food safety |url=http://who.insomnation.com/sites/default/files/pdf/fan_cholera%20fact%20sheet7.pdf |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date= |accessdate=2017-08-20 |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821044840/http://who.insomnation.com/sites/default/files/pdf/fan_cholera%20fact%20sheet7.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveillance ===
[[File:Using Precipitation Data to Assess Risk of Cholera Outbreaks.webm|thumb|upright=1.3|A modelling approach using satellite data can enhance our ability to develop cholera risk maps in several regions of the globe.]]
Surveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly. Cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries, occurring annually mostly during [[Wet season|rainy seasons]]. Surveillance systems can provide early alerts to outbreaks, therefore leading to coordinated response and assist in preparation of preparedness plans. Efficient surveillance systems can also improve the risk assessment for potential cholera outbreaks. Understanding the seasonality and location of outbreaks provides guidance for improving cholera control activities for the most vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/cholera/control/en/index.html |title=Cholera: prevention and control |publisher=WHO |work=Health topics |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214042133/http://www.who.int/topics/cholera/control/en/index.html |archivedate=2008-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For prevention to be effective, it is important that cases be reported to national health authorities.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt;

Although much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera, this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen in some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human [[feces]] and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread, but bodies of water can serve as a [[Natural reservoir|reservoir]], and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. Cholera was not known in the [[Americas]] for most of the 20th century, but it reappeared towards the end of that century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blake PA | title = Epidemiology of cholera in the Americas | journal = Gastroenterol.

Spanish physician [[Jaume Ferran i Clua]] developed a cholera inoculation in 1885, the first to immunize humans against a bacterial disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/others#EVT_101034 onlinelibrary.wiley.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211100824/http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/others |date=2015-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian-Jewish bacteriologist [[Waldemar Haffkine]] developed the first cholera vaccine in July 1892.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haffkineinstitute.org/waldemar.htm haffkineinstitute.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924024552/http://www.haffkineinstitute.org/waldemar.htm |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major contributions to fighting cholera was made by the physician and pioneer medical scientist [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] (1813–1858), who in 1854 found a link between cholera and contaminated drinking water.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rosenberg, Charles E. |title=The cholera years: the United States in 1832, 1849 and 1866 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1987 |pages= |isbn=978-0-226-72677-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Snow proposed a microbial origin for epidemic cholera in 1849. In his major "state of the art" review of 1855, he proposed a substantially complete and correct model for the cause of the disease. In two pioneering epidemiological field studies, he was able to demonstrate human [[sewage]] contamination was the most probable disease vector in two major epidemics in London in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Dr John Snow, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP5 ''The mode of communication of cholera''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106215135/https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP5 |date=2015-11-06 }}, 2nd ed. (London, England:  John Churchill, 1855).&lt;/ref&gt; His model was not immediately accepted, but it was seen to be the more plausible, as medical microbiology developed over the next 30 years or so.

Cities in developed nations made massive investment in clean water supply and well-separated sewage treatment infrastructures between the mid-1850s and the 1900s. This eliminated the threat of cholera epidemics from the major developed cities in the world. In 1883, [[Robert Koch]] identified ''V. cholerae'' with a microscope as the bacillus causing the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Aberth, John. Plagues in World History. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2011, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Allan Phillips]], working at the US [[Naval Medical Research Unit Two]] in Southeast Asia, evaluated the pathophysiology of the disease using modern laboratory chemistry techniques and developed a protocol for rehydration.

From the various experiments they conducted, the researchers found a correlation between the passage of ''V. cholerae'' through the human digestive system and an increased infectivity state. Furthermore, the researchers found the bacterium creates a hyperinfected state where [[gene]]s that control biosynthesis of [[amino acid]]s, [[iron]] uptake systems, and formation of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes were induced just before defecation. These induced characteristics allow the cholera vibrios to survive in the "rice water" stools, an environment of limited oxygen and iron, of patients with a cholera infection.&lt;ref name="Merrell2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Merrell DS, Butler SM, Qadri F, Dolganov NA, Alam A, Cohen MB, Calderwood SB, Schoolnik GK, Camilli A | title = Host-induced epidemic spread of the cholera bacterium | journal = Nature | volume = 417 | issue = 6889 | pages = 642–5 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12050664 | pmc = 2776822 | doi = 10.1038/nature00778 | ref = harv | bibcode = 2002Natur.417..642M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health policy ===
In many developing countries, cholera still reaches its victims through contaminated water sources, and countries without proper sanitation techniques have greater incidence of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;"Cholera vaccines. A brief summary of the March 2010 position paper" (PDF). World Health Organization. Retrieved September 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Governments can play a role in this. In 2008, for example, the [[Zimbabwean cholera outbreak]] was due partly to the government's role, according to a report from the [[James Baker Institute]].&lt;ref name="bakerinstitute.org" /&gt; The Haitian government's inability to provide safe drinking water after the 2010 earthquake led to an increase in cholera cases as well.&lt;ref name="pmid21142690"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walton DA, Ivers LC | title = Responding to cholera in post-earthquake Haiti | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 364 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–5 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21142690 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1012997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, South Africa's cholera outbreak was exacerbated by the government's policy of privatizing water programs. The wealthy elite of the country were able to afford safe water while others had to use water from cholera-infected rivers.{{failed verification|date=November 2013}}&lt;ref name="pmid14758861"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pauw J | title = The politics of underdevelopment: metered to death-how a water experiment caused riots and a cholera epidemic | journal = Int. J. Health Serv. | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 819–30 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14758861 | doi = 10.2190/kf8j-5nqd-xcyu-u8q7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Rita R. Colwell]] of the [[James Baker Institute]], if cholera does begin to spread, government preparedness is crucial. A government's ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of ''Vibrio cholerae'' specimens.&lt;ref name="bakerinstitute.org" /&gt; Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government's ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be "Cholera-affected"; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health.&lt;ref name="John, T. Jacob 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=John TJ, Rajappan K, Arjunan KK | title = Communicable diseases monitored by disease surveillance in Kottayam district, Kerala state, India | journal = Indian J. Med. Res. | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 86–93 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15347857 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These task forces promoted the boiling of water to obtain safe water, and provided chlorine and oral rehydration salts.&lt;ref name="John, T. Jacob 2004" /&gt; Ultimately, this helped to control the spread of the disease to other areas and minimize deaths. On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government's surveillance program. This inhibited physicians' abilities to detect cholera cases early.&lt;ref name="pmid1500643"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siddique AK, Zaman K, Baqui AH, Akram K, Mutsuddy P, Eusof A, Haider K, Islam S, Sack RB | title = Cholera epidemics in Bangladesh: 1985–1991 | journal = J.

According to Colwell, the quality and inclusiveness of a country's health care system affects the control of cholera, as it did in the [[Zimbabwean cholera outbreak]].&lt;ref name="bakerinstitute.org" /&gt; While sanitation practices are important, when governments respond quickly and have readily available vaccines, the country will have a lower cholera death toll. Affordability of vaccines can be a problem; if the governments do not provide vaccinations, only the wealthy may be able to afford them and there will be a greater toll on the country's poor.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeRoeck D, Clemens JD, Nyamete A, Mahoney RT | title = Policymakers' views regarding the introduction of new-generation vaccines against typhoid fever, shigellosis and cholera in Asia | journal = Vaccine | volume = 23 | issue = 21 | pages = 2762–2774 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15780724 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.11.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Choe | first1 = Chongwoo | last2 = Raschky | first2 = Paul A. | title = Media, institutions, and government action: prevention vs. palliation in the time of cholera | journal = [[Eur.

Besides contributing to an effective or declining public health care system and water sanitation treatments, government can have indirect effects on cholera control and the effectiveness of a response to cholera.&lt;ref name="Kapp, Clare 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kapp C | title = Zimbabwe's humanitarian crisis worsens | journal = Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9662 | pages = 447 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19205080 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60151-3 | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60151-3/fulltext | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090827090207/http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60151-3/fulltext | archivedate = 2009-08-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A country's government can impact its ability to prevent disease and control its spread. A speedy government response backed by a fully functioning health care system and financial resources can prevent cholera's spread. This limits cholera's ability to cause death, or at the very least a decline in education, as children are kept out of school to minimize the risk of infection.&lt;ref name="Kapp, Clare 2009" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2609">'''Rural water circuit riders''' are roving technical experts employed by [[Rural Water#Members|State Rural Water Associations]] to provide training and assistance to rural and small water [[utilities]] within their state.

==History==

The [[National Rural Water Association]] began its circuit rider program in 1980. The program was intended to provide support for small utility systems that did not always have the experience, equipment, training or personnel to deal with large or persistent problems. Circuit riders usually operate within a specific area of their designated state, visiting the small utilities on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Circuit Riders Excel With Nation’s Small Systems |year=2009|publisher=[[National Rural Water Association]]|accessdate=2009-05-21|url=http://www.nrwa.org/NRWAupdates/Circuit%20Riders%20small%20systems.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drinking water/wastewater==

Circuit riders are usually categorized as either [[drinking water]] or [[wastewater]] specialists. Drinking water circuit riders specialize in the supply, treatment and distribution of clean drinking water through a water utility. Wastewater circuit riders specialize in the processes required for the safe collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater and [[sewage]]. Circuit riders in both fields have extensive knowledge and experience with the state and federal regulations governing drinking water and wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Drinking water restored in Maine town|year=2009|publisher=[[National Rural Water Association]]|accessdate=2009-05-21|url=http://nrwa.org/NRWAupdates/2008%2012%20December/Pittfield%20assistance.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management and accounting==

Some state associations have circuit riders who specialize in assisting utilities with management, accounting and record-keeping issues. These circuit riders are often asked to perform rate studies, which examine a utility's expenses and incomes and recommends rates that allows them to meet their financial obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Rural Water assists district with financial records, grant application|year=2009|publisher=[[National Rural Water Association]]|accessdate=2009-05-21|url=http://nrwa.org/NRWAupdates/2009%2007%20July/ValleyViewmoney.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4930">'''Circuit training''' is a form of body conditioning or [[endurance training]] or [[resistance training]] using high-intensity. It targets strength building or muscular endurance. An exercise "circuit" is one completion of all prescribed exercises in the program. When one circuit is complete, one begins the first exercise again for the next circuit. Traditionally, the time between exercises in circuit training is short, often with rapid movement to the next exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportireland.ie/Coaching-Ireland/Publications-/Circuit-Training.pdf|title=CIRCUIT TRAINING. Development of Strength &amp; Conditioning|last=Comyns|first=Tom|date=|website=Coaching Ireland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was developed by R.E. Morgan and G.T. Anderson in 1953 at the [[University of Leeds]] in [[England]].&lt;ref name="UNM"&gt;{{cite web

==Typical activities in a circuit training==
A circuit should work each section of the body individually. Typical activities include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmac.co.uk/circuit.htm|title=Circuit Training|author=Brian Mackenzie|work=brianmac.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of circuit training==
Studies at Baylor University and The Cooper Institute show that circuit training is the most time efficient way to enhance cardiovascular fitness and muscle endurance. Studies show that circuit training helps women to achieve their goals and maintain them longer than other forms of exercise or diet.&lt;ref name="Curves"&gt;Heavin, Gary and Colman, Carol, C. Reprint edition (December 7, 2004). ''Curves: Permanent Results Without Permanent Dieting'', {{ISBN|0-399-52956-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan and Anderson claim:
{{quote|
Perhaps a most profound finding of this study, from a health perspective, is that this investigation clearly shows that performance of this circuit of exercises,this level of intensity elicited oxygen consumption values (39% to 51.5% of VO2max) that meet established guidelines of the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] (ACSM) for the recommended intensity (40% to 85% of [[VO2max]]R) of exercise for developing and maintaining cardio-respiratory fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klika|first=Brett|title=High-Intensity Circuit Training Using Body Weight: Maximum Results With Minimal Investment|url=http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx#P98 |publisher=ACSM's Health &amp; Fitness Journal|accessdate=20 September 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this circuit not only provides a suitable muscular fitness stimulus but also helps to meet ACSM cardiovascular guidelines and the newly published Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 for physical activity.&lt;ref name="UNM" /&gt;
}}

One advantage is that reduced station times will encourage the participants to lift heavier weights, which means they can achieve overload with smaller number of repetitions: typically in the range of 25 to 50 depending on their training goals.&lt;ref name="ACSM"&gt;http://westvalley.edu/academics/pe_department/physical_education/programs/weighttraining/acsm-resistancetraining.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Croup''', also known as '''laryngotracheobronchitis''', is a type of [[respiratory infection]] that is usually caused by a [[virus]].&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt; The infection leads to swelling inside the [[trachea]], which interferes with normal breathing and produces the classic symptoms of "barking" [[cough]], [[stridor]], and a [[hoarseness|hoarse voice]].&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt; [[Fever]] and runny nose may also be present.&lt;ref name=Au10&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rajapaksa S, Starr M | title = Croup – assessment and management | journal = Aust Fam Physician | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 280–2 |date=May 2010 | pmid = 20485713 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These symptoms may be mild, moderate, or severe.&lt;ref name=Croup09&gt;{{cite journal | author = Johnson D | title = Croup | journal = Clin Evid (Online) | volume = 2009 | issue =  | pages =  | year = 2009 | pmid = 19445760 | pmc = 2907784 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often it starts or is worse at night.&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Croup09/&gt; It normally lasts one to two days.&lt;ref name=Thom2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=M|author2=Vodicka, TA |author3=Blair, PS |author4=Buckley, DI |author5=Heneghan, C |author6=Hay, AD |author7= TARGET Programme, Team |title=Duration of symptoms of respiratory tract infections in children: systematic review.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Dec 11, 2013|volume=347|pages=f7027|pmid=24335668|doi=10.1136/bmj.f7027 |pmc=3898587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Croup can be caused by a number of viruses including [[parainfluenza]] and [[influenza virus]].&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt; Rarely is it due to a [[bacterial infection]].&lt;ref name=Cherry08&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cherry JD | title = Clinical practice.

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Many cases of croup are preventable by [[immunization]] for [[influenza]] and [[diphtheria]].&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt; Croup is usually treated with a single dose of [[steroids]] by mouth.&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gate2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gates |first1=A |last2=Gates |first2=M |last3=Vandermeer |first3=B |last4=Johnson |first4=C |last5=Hartling |first5=L |last6=Johnson |first6=DW |last7=Klassen |first7=TP |title=Glucocorticoids for croup in children. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=22 August 2018 |volume=8 |pages=CD001955 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001955.pub4 |pmid=30133690}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more severe cases inhaled [[epinephrine]] may also be used.&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bjornson|first1=C|last2=Russell|first2=K|last3=Vandermeer|first3=B|last4=Klassen|first4=TP|last5=Johnson|first5=DW|title=Nebulized epinephrine for croup in children.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=10 October 2013|volume=10|pages=CD006619|pmid=24114291|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006619.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitalization is required in one to five percent of cases.&lt;ref name=CMAJ2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bjornson|first1=CL|last2=Johnson|first2=DW|title=Croup in children.|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal |date=15 October 2013|volume=185|issue=15|pages=1317–23|pmid=23939212|doi=10.1503/cmaj.121645|pmc=3796596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Epidemiology and history --&gt;
Croup is a relatively common condition that affects about 15% of children at some point.&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt; It most commonly occurs between 6 months and 5 years of age but may rarely be seen in children as old as fifteen.&lt;ref name=Croup09/&gt;&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt;&lt;ref name=CMAJ2013/&gt; It is slightly more common in males than females.&lt;ref name=CMAJ2013/&gt; It occurs most often in autumn.&lt;ref name=CMAJ2013/&gt; Before [[vaccination]], croup was frequently caused by [[diphtheria]] and was often fatal.&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steele|first1=Volney|title=Bleed, blister, and purge : a history of medicine on the American frontier|date=2005|publisher=Mountain Press|location=Missoula, Mont.|isbn=978-0-87842-505-1|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cause is now very rare in the Western world due to the success of the [[DPT vaccine|diphtheria vaccine]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book |author=Feigin, Ralph D. |title=Textbook of pediatric infectious diseases |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2004 |page=252 |isbn=0-7216-9329-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croup is characterized by a "barking" [[cough]], [[stridor]], [[hoarseness]], and [[Shortness of breath|difficulty breathing]] which usually worsens at night.&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt; The "barking" cough is often described as resembling the call of a [[Pinniped|seal]] or [[sea lion]].&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt;  The stridor is worsened by agitation or [[crying]], and if it can be heard at rest, it may indicate critical narrowing of the airways. As croup worsens, stridor may decrease considerably.&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt;

Other symptoms include [[fever]], [[coryza]] (symptoms typical of the [[common cold]]), and indrawing of the [[chest wall]]–known as [[Hoover's sign (pulmonary)|Hoover's sign]].&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alberta07&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.childhealthbc.ca/resources/category/5-croup?download=13%3Acroup-guideline |format=PDF|title=Diagnosis and Management of Croup |work=BC Children's Hospital Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine Clinical Practice Guidelines |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Drooling]] or a very sick appearance indicate other medical conditions, such as [[epiglottitis]].&lt;ref name=Alberta07/&gt;

==Causes==
Croup is usually deemed to be due to a viral infection.&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt;&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt; Others use the term more broadly, to include acute [[Laryngitis|laryngotracheitis]], spasmodic croup, laryngeal diphtheria, [[bacterial tracheitis]], laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity.&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt;

===Viral===
Viral croup or acute laryngotracheitis is most commonly caused by [[parainfluenza virus]] (a member of the [[paramyxovirus]] family), primarily types 1 and 2, in 75% of cases.&lt;ref name=Croup09/&gt; Other viral causes include [[influenza]] A and B, [[measles]], [[adenovirus]] and [[respiratory syncytial virus]] (RSV).&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt; Spasmodic croup is caused by the same group of viruses as acute laryngotracheitis, but lacks the usual signs of infection (such as fever, sore throat, and increased [[white blood cell count]]).&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt;  Treatment, and response to treatment, are also similar.&lt;ref name=Croup09/&gt;

===Bacterial===
Bacterial croup may be divided into laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis.&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt;  Laryngeal diphtheria is due to ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'' while bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis are usually due to a primary viral infection with secondary bacterial growth.  The most common bacteria implicated are ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Hemophilus influenzae]]'', and ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]''.&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
The viral infection that causes croup leads to swelling of the [[larynx]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], and large [[bronchi]]&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt; due to infiltration of [[white blood cells]] (especially [[histiocytes]], [[lymphocytes]], [[plasma cells]], and [[neutrophils]]).&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt; Swelling produces airway obstruction which, when significant, leads to dramatically increased work of breathing and the characteristic turbulent, noisy airflow known as [[stridor]].&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt;

Croup is typically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms.&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt; The first step is to exclude other obstructive conditions of the upper airway, especially [[epiglottitis]], an airway [[foreign body]], [[subglottic stenosis]], [[angioedema]], [[retropharyngeal abscess]], and [[bacterial tracheitis]].&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt;

A frontal [[X-ray]] of the neck is not routinely performed,&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt; but if it is done, it may show a characteristic narrowing of the trachea, called the [[steeple sign]], because of the subglottic stenosis, which resembles a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]] in shape.  The steeple sign is suggestive of the diagnosis, but is absent in half of cases.&lt;ref name=Alberta07/&gt;

Other investigations (such as [[blood test]]s and [[viral culture]]) are discouraged, as they may cause unnecessary agitation and thus worsen the stress on the compromised airway.&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt; While viral cultures, obtained via [[nasopharyngeal]] aspiration, can be used to confirm the exact cause, these are usually restricted to research settings.&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt; Bacterial infection should be considered if a person does not improve with standard treatment, at which point further investigations may be indicated.&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt;

===Severity===
The most commonly used system for classifying the severity of croup is the Westley score. It is primarily used for research purposes rather than in clinical practice.&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt; It is the sum of points assigned for five factors: level of consciousness, cyanosis, stridor, air entry, and retractions.&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt; The points given for each factor is listed in the adjacent table, and the final score ranges from 0 to 17.&lt;ref name=Peds99/&gt;

* A total score of ≤&amp;nbsp;2 indicates ''mild'' croup. The characteristic barking cough and hoarseness may be present, but there is no stridor at rest.&lt;ref name=Croup09/&gt;
* A total score of 3–5 is classified as ''moderate'' croup.  It presents with easily heard stridor, but with few other signs.&lt;ref name=Croup09/&gt;
* A total score of 6–11 is ''severe'' croup.  It also presents with obvious stridor, but also features marked [[chest wall]] indrawing.&lt;ref name=Croup09/&gt;
* A total score of ≥&amp;nbsp;12 indicates impending [[respiratory failure]].  The barking cough and stridor may no longer be prominent at this stage.&lt;ref name=Croup09/&gt;

85% of children presenting to the emergency department have mild disease; severe croup is rare (&lt;1%).&lt;ref name=Croup09/&gt;

==Prevention==
Many cases of croup have been prevented by [[immunization]] for [[influenza]] and [[diphtheria]].&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt; At one time, croup referred to a diphtherial disease, but with vaccination, diphtheria is now rare in the developed world.&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt;

==Treatment==
Children with croup are generally kept as calm as possible.&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt;  Steroids are given routinely, with [[epinephrine]] used in severe cases.&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt; Children with [[oxygen saturation]]s under 92% should receive oxygen,&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt; and those with severe croup may be hospitalized for observation.&lt;ref name=Alberta07/&gt; If oxygen is needed, "blow-by" administration (holding an oxygen source near the child's face) is recommended, as it causes less agitation than use of a [[oxygen mask|mask]].&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt; With treatment, less than 0.2% of children require [[endotracheal intubation]].&lt;ref name=Peds99&gt;{{cite journal | author = Klassen TP | title = Croup.

===Steroids===
[[Corticosteroids]], such as [[dexamethasone]] and [[budesonide]], have been shown to improve outcomes in children with all severities of croup.&lt;ref name=Cochrane11&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russell KF, Liang Y, O'Gorman K, Johnson DW, Klassen TP | title = Glucocorticoids for croup | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = CD001955 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21249651 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001955.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30133690|date = November 2018}} Significant relief is obtained as early as two hours after administration.&lt;ref name=Gate2018/&gt; While effective when given [[parenteral|by injection]], or by inhalation, giving the medication by mouth is preferred.&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt; A single dose is usually all that is required, and is generally considered to be quite safe.&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt; Dexamethasone at doses of  0.15, 0.3 and 0.6&amp;nbsp;mg/kg appear to be all equally effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Port C | title = Towards evidence based emergency medicine: best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary.

===Epinephrine===
Moderate to severe croup may be improved temporarily with [[nebulizer|nebulized]] [[epinephrine]].&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt; While epinephrine typically produces a reduction in croup severity within 10–30 minutes, the benefits last for only about 2 hours.&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt;&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt; If the condition remains improved for 2–4&amp;nbsp;hours after treatment and no other complications arise, the child is typically discharged from the hospital.&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt;&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt;

===Other===
While other treatments for croup have been studied, none have sufficient evidence to support their use. Inhalation of hot steam or humidified air is a traditional [[self-care]] treatment, but clinical studies have failed to show effectiveness&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt; and currently it is rarely used.&lt;ref name=Hist2001&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marchessault V | title = Historical review of croup | journal = Can J Infect Dis | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 337–9 |date=November 2001 | pmid = 18159359 | pmc = 2094841 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[cough medicine]]s, which usually contain [[dextromethorphan]] or [[guaifenesin]], are also discouraged.&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt; There is tentative evidence that breathing [[heliox]] (a mixture of [[helium]] and [[oxygen]]) to decrease the work of breathing is useful in those with severe disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moraa|first1=I|last2=Sturman|first2=N|last3=McGuire|first3=T|last4=van Driel|first4=ML|title=Heliox for croup in children.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=7 December 2013|issue=12|pages=CD006822|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006822.pub4|pmid=24318607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since croup is usually a viral disease, [[antibiotics]] are not used unless secondary bacterial infection is suspected.&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt; In cases of possible secondary bacterial infection, the antibiotics [[vancomycin]] and [[cefotaxime]] are recommended.&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt; In severe cases associated with influenza&amp;nbsp;A or B, the [[antiviral drug|antiviral]] [[neuraminidase inhibitors]] may be administered.&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt;

==Prognosis==
Viral croup is usually a [[Self-limiting (biology)|self-limiting]] disease,&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt; with half of cases resolving in a day and 80% of cases in two days.&lt;ref name=Thom2013/&gt; It can very rarely result in death from [[respiratory failure]] and/or [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref name=Au10/&gt;  Symptoms usually improve within two&amp;nbsp;days, but may last for up to seven&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name=Croup09/&gt; Other uncommon complications include [[bacterial tracheitis]], [[pneumonia]], and [[pulmonary edema]].&lt;ref name=Croup09/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Croup affects about 15% of children, and usually presents between the ages of 6 months and 5–6 years.&lt;ref name=PedN09/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt; It accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions in this population.&lt;ref name=Croup09/&gt; In rare cases, it may occur in children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years.&lt;ref name=Croup09/&gt; Males are affected 50% more frequently than are females, and there is an increased [[prevalence]] in autumn.&lt;ref name=Cherry08/&gt;

==History==
The word ''croup'' comes from the [[Early Modern English]] verb ''croup'', meaning "to cry hoarsely"; the name was first applied to the disease in Scotland and popularized in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymological Dictionary, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=croup croup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510032149/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=croup |date=2011-05-10 }}. Accessed 2010-09-13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diphtheritic croup]] has been known since the time of [[Homer]]'s [[Ancient Greece]] and it was not until 1826 that viral croup was differentiated from croup due to [[diphtheria]] by [[Pierre Bretonneau|Bretonneau]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hist2001/&gt; Viral croup was then called "faux-croup" by the French and often called "false croup" in English,&lt;ref name=cormack&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cormack|first=John Rose|title=Meaning of the Terms Diphtheria, Croup, and Faux Croup|journal=[[British Medical Journal]]|date=8 May 1875|volume=1|number=749|page=606|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.749.606|pmid=20747853|pmc=2297755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=loving&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loving|first=Starling|title=Something concerning the diagnosis and treatment of false croup|journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association]]|date=5 October 1895|volume=XXV|number=14|pages=567–573|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FQcAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA567|accessdate=16 April 2014|doi=10.1001/jama.1895.02430400011001d|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704192208/http://books.google.com/books?id=-FQcAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA567|archivedate=4 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "croup" or "true croup" then most often referred to the disease caused by the [[Corynebacterium diphtheriae|diphtheria bacterium]].&lt;ref name=bennett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bennett|first=James Risdon|title=True and False Croup|journal=[[British Medical Journal]]|date=8 May 1875|volume=1|number=749|pages=606–607|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.749.606-a|pmid=20747854|pmc=2297754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beard&gt;{{cite book|last=Beard|first=George Miller|title=Our Home Physician: A New and Popular Guide to the Art of Preserving Health and Treating Disease|year=1875|publisher=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9126">'''Delusional intuition'''  is a term applicable in psychiatry that refers to a thought or belief that when expressed either in society, or as usually in a clinical setting, is apparent as being blatantly impossible or unlikely in that the semantic relations of subjects within the speech content  have no basis in reality, i.e. that is of a  thought that  is [[delusion]]al. This type of  delusion in the context of the ''[[Intuition (psychology)|intuitive]]'' is rather an experience of faux intuition, the person experiences something that resembles the intuitive, but instead the experience is qualified as delusional. This delusion is also described  as Autochthonous.&lt;ref&gt;David Christmas ([[NHS Tayside]] and  [[University of Dundee]]) - [http://www.trickcyclists.co.uk/pdf/Descriptive_Psychopathology.PDF Copyright © 2002-2011 David Christmas.

'''Emotional eating''' is defined as overeating in order to relieve negative emotions. Thus, emotional eating is considered a [[Maladaptation|maladaptive]] [[coping (psychology)|coping]] strategy. If an individual frequently engages in emotional eating, it can increase the risk of developing other [[eating disorder]]s, like [[bulimia]] and [[anorexia nervosa]]. Research has also shown that the presence of an existing eating disorder increases the likelihood that an individual will engage in emotional eating. Given the relationship between serious eating disorders and emotional eating behavior, it is important for clinical psychologists and nutritionists to recognize the signs of emotional eating and provide individuals with treatment. Since emotional eating is utilized to manage negative emotions, treatment necessitates learning healthy and more effective coping strategies.

== Background ==

Emotional eating is a form of [[Eating disorder|disordered eating]] and is defined as "an increase in food intake in response to negative emotions"&lt;ref name="spoor"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spoor | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Bekker | first2 = M. H. | last3 = van Strien | first3 = T. | last4 = van Heck | first4 = G. L. | year = 2007 | title = Relations between negative affect, coping, and emotional eating | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 368–376 | doi=10.1016/j.appet.2006.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be considered a maladaptive strategy used to cope with difficult feelings. More specifically, emotional eating would qualify as a form of emotion-focused coping, which attempts to minimize, regulate and prevent emotional [[distress (medicine)|distress]].&lt;ref&gt;(Carver, Charles S. "Coping." The Handbook of Stress Science. New York: Springer, 2011. 221-29. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by Bennett et al. found that emotional eating sometimes does not reduce emotional distress but instead enhances emotional distress by sparking feelings of intense guilt after an emotional eating session.&lt;ref name="benn"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = J. | last2 = Greene | first2 = G. | last3 = Schwartz-Barcott | first3 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Perceptions of emotional eating behavior. A qualitative study of college students | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 187–192 | doi = 10.1016/j.appet.2012.09.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is emotional eating a poor way to cope, but those individuals who frequently utilize emotional eating to cope with social or psychological stressors are at an increased risk of developing eating disorders.&lt;ref name="spoor"/&gt; Emotional eaters are at an especially high risk of developing binge-eating disorder.  2.8% of Americans struggle with binge-eating disorder, which increases their risk of developing cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;(Eating disorders among adults - binge eating disorder. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.nimh.nih.gov/statistics/1EAT_ADULT_RB.shtml)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the presence of other eating disorders increases the risk of an individual engaging in emotional eating.&lt;ref name="spoor"/&gt;  In a clinical setting, emotional eating disorders can be diagnosed by the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire which contains a scale for restrained, emotional and external eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van Strien | first1 = T | year = 1986 | title = The dutch eating behavior questionnaire (debq) for assessment of restrained, emotional, and external eating behavior | url = | journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 295–315 | doi = 10.1002/1098-108X(198602)5:2&lt;295::AID-EAT2260050209&gt;3.0.CO;2-T }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While therapists may use positive psychology as a way to reduce the negative emotions that trigger emotional eating, reappraisal is often a complementary treatment with the primary treatment being focused on developing alternative coping strategies.

== Major theories ==
Current research suggests that certain individual factors may increase one's likelihood of using emotional eating as a coping strategy. The inadequate [[affect regulation]] theory posits that individuals engage in emotional eating because they believe overeating alleviates negative feelings.&lt;ref name="spoor"/&gt; Escape theory builds upon inadequate affect regulation theory by suggesting that people not only overeat to cope with negative emotions, but they find that overeating diverts their attention away from a stimuli that is threatening self-esteem to focus on a pleasurable stimuli like food. Restraint theory suggests that overeating as a result of negative emotions occurs among individuals who already restrain their eating. While these individuals typically limit what they eat, when they are faced with negative emotions they cope by engaging in emotional eating.&lt;ref name="spoor"/&gt; Restraint theory supports the idea that individuals with other eating disorders are more likely to engage in emotional eating. Together these three theories suggest that an individual's aversion to negative emotions, particularly negative feelings that arise in response to a threat to the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] or intense [[self-awareness]], increase the propensity for the individual to utilize emotional eating as a means of coping with this aversion.

The biological stress response may also contribute to the development of emotional eating tendencies. In a crisis, [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH) is secreted by the [[hypothalamus]], suppressing appetite and triggering the release of [[glucocorticoid]]s from the [[adrenal gland]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers|last=Sapolsky|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert Sapolsky|publisher=W. H. Freeman|year=1998|isbn=978-0716732105|location=|pages=39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; These steroid hormones increase appetite and, unlike CRH, remain in the bloodstream for a prolonged period of time, often resulting in [[hyperphagia]]. Those who experience this biologically instigated increase in appetite during times of stress are therefore primed to rely on emotional eating as a coping mechanism.

== Characteristics ==
Emotional eating differs from actual hunger in a number of ways. Emotional hunger tends to hit quickly and suddenly and feels urgent, yet physical hunger is usually not as urgent or sudden unless it has been a while since a person ate. Someone who is physically hungry will often eat anything, while someone who is emotionally hungry will want something specific, such as fries or a pizza; emotional hunger is usually associated with cravings for junk food or something unhealthy. Another aspect of emotional eating is mindless eating, which is when someone eats without paying attention to or enjoying what they are consuming. An example is eating an entire container of ice cream while watching television, having not intended to eat that much. This behavior usually happens with emotional eating, not eating through hunger. Emotional hunger does not originate from the stomach, such as with a rumbling or growling stomach, but tends to start when a person thinks about a craving or wants something specific to eat. Emotional responses are also different. Giving in to a craving, or eating because of stress can cause feelings of regret, shame, or guilt, and these responses tend to be associated with emotional hunger. On the other hand, satisfying a physical hunger is giving the body the nutrients or calories it needs to function and is not associated with negative feelings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320935.php|title=Emotional eating: How to overcome stress eating|last=Galan|first=Nicole|date=15 February 2018|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing factors ==

=== Negative affect ===

Overall, high levels of the negative affect trait are related to emotional eating. [[Negative affectivity]] is a personality trait involving negative emotions and poor self-concept. It has been found that certain negative affect regulation scales predicted emotional eating.&lt;ref name="spence"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spence | first1 = S. | last2 = Courbasson | first2 = C. | year = 2012 | title = The role of emotional dysregulation in concurrent eating disorders and substance use disorders | url = | journal = Eating Behaviors | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 382–385 | doi = 10.1016/j.eatbeh.2012.05.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study conducted by Bennett et al. found that individuals engage in emotional eating only when they are experiencing negative emotions.&lt;ref name="benn"/&gt; More specifically, an inability to articulate and identify one's emotions made the individual feel inadequate at regulating negative affect and thus more likely to engage in emotional eating.&lt;ref name="spence"/&gt; A study conducted by Spoor et al. attempted to further delineate the relationship between negative affect and emotional eating.&lt;ref name="spoor"/&gt; They found that negative affect was not significantly related to emotional eating when taking into consideration emotion focused coping and avoidance distraction behavior. This suggests that negative affect is not independently related to emotional eating but is instead indirectly related through emotional focused coping and avoidance distraction behavior. While Spence and Spoor's findings differed somewhat, they both suggest that negative affect does play a role in emotional eating but it may be accounted for by other variables.&lt;ref name="spoor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spence"/&gt;

=== Childhood development ===
For some people, emotional eating is a learned behavior. During childhood, their parents give them treats to help them deal with a tough day or situation, or as a reward for something good. Over time, the child who reaches for a cookie after getting a bad grade on a test may become an adult who grabs a box of cookies after a rough day at work. In an example such as this, the roots of emotional eating are deep, which can make breaking the habit extremely challenging.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Related disorders ===
Emotional eating itself may be a precursor to developing eating disorders such as [[binge eating]] or [[bulimia nervosa]]. The relationship between emotional eating and other disorders is largely due to the fact that emotional eating and these disorders share key characteristics. More specifically, they are both related to emotion focused coping, maladaptive coping strategies, and a strong aversion to negative feelings and stimuli. It is important to note that the causal direction has not been definitively established, meaning that while emotional eating is considered a precursor to these eating disorders, it may be also be the consequence of these disorders. The latter hypothesis that emotional eating happens in response to another eating disorder is supported by research that has shown emotional eating to be more common among individuals already suffering from bulimia nervosa.&lt;ref name="spence"/&gt;

=== Biological and environmental factors ===
Stress affect food preferences. Numerous studies — granted, many of them in animals — have shown that physical or emotional distress increases the intake of food high in fat, sugar, or both. High cortisol levels, in combination with high insulin levels, may be responsible. Other research suggests that ghrelin, a "hunger hormone," may have a role. Once ingested, fat- and sugar-filled foods seem to have a feedback effect that dampens stress related responses and emotions. These foods really are "comfort" foods in that they seem to counteract stress. This may contribute to people's stress-induced craving for those foods. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/why-stress-causes-people-to-overeat|title=Why stress causes people to overeat - Harvard Health|last=|first=Harvard Health|date=February 2012|work=Harvard Health|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;Individual differences in the physiological stress response may also contribute to the development of emotional eating habits. Those whose adrenal glands naturally secrete larger quantities of glucocorticoids in response to a stressor are more inclined toward hyperphagia, which can act as a physiological catalyst for emotional eating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, those whose bodies require more time to clear the bloodstream of excess glucocorticoids are similarly predisposed. These biological factors can interact with environmental elements to further trigger hyperphagia, namely the type of stressor the individual is subjected to. Frequent intermittent stressors trigger repeated, sporadic releases of glucocorticoids broken up by intervals too short to allow for a complete return to baseline levels, leading to increased appetite. Those whose lifestyles or careers entail frequent intermittent stressors thus have greater biological incentive to develop patterns of emotional eating.

== Impact ==
Emotional eating may qualify as avoidant coping and/or emotion-focused coping. As coping methods that fall under these broad categories focus on temporary reprieve rather than practical resolution of stressors, they can initiate a vicious cycle of maladaptive behavior reinforced by fleeting relief from stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-pritchard/emotional-eating_b_2892147.html|title=Emotional Eating as a Coping Mechanism|date=2013-03-19|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the presence of high insulin levels characteristic of the recovery phase of the stress-response, glucocorticoids trigger the creation of an enzyme that stores away the nutrients circulating in the bloodstream after an episode of emotional eating as visceral fat, or fat located in the abdominal area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, those who struggle with emotional eating are at greater risk for abdominal obesity, which is in turn linked to a greater risk for metabolic and cardiovascular disease.

== Treatment ==
There are numerous ways in which individuals can reduce emotional distress without engaging in emotional eating. The most salient choice is to minimize maladaptive coping strategies and to maximize adaptive strategies. A study conducted by Corstorphine et al. in 2007 investigated the relationship between [[distress tolerance]] and disordered eating.&lt;ref name="cors"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Corstorphine | first1 = E. | last2 = Mountford | first2 = V. | last3 = Tomlinson | first3 = S. | last4 = Waller | first4 = G. | last5 = Meyer | first5 = C. | year = 2007 | title = Distress tolerance in the eating disorders | url = | journal = Eating Behaviors | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 91–97 | doi = 10.1016/j.eatbeh.2007.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers specifically focused on how different coping strategies impact distress tolerance and disordered eating. They found that individuals who engage in disordered eating often employ emotional avoidance strategies. If an individual is faced with strong negative emotions, they may choose to avoid the situation by distracting themselves through overeating.  Discouraging emotional avoidance is thus an important facet to emotional eating treatment. The most obvious way to limit emotional avoidance is to confront the issue through techniques like problem solving. Corstorphine et al. showed that individuals who engaged in problem solving strategies enhance one's ability to tolerate emotional distress.&lt;ref name="cors"/&gt; Since emotional distress is correlated to emotional eating, the ability to better manage one's negative affect should allow an individual to cope with a situation without resorting to overeating.

One way to combat emotional eating is to employ mindfulness techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.factfindersteph.com/weight-loss-2/comfort-foods-men-vs-women-3-ways-to-curb-your-cravings/#sthash.so8q8w9x.dpuf|title=Comfort Foods: Men Vs Women &amp; 3 Ways to Curb Your Cravings|website=www.factfindersteph.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, approaching cravings with a nonjudgmental inquisitiveness can help differentiate between hunger and emotionally-driven cravings. An individual may ask his or herself if the craving developed rapidly, as emotional eating tends to be triggered spontaneously. An individual may also take the time to note his or her bodily sensations, such as hunger pangs, and coinciding emotions, like guilt or shame, in order to make conscious decisions to avoid emotional eating.

Emotional eating can also be improved by evaluating physical facets like hormone balance. Female hormones, in particular, can alter cravings and even self-perception of one's body. Additionally, emotional eating can be exacerbated by social pressure to be thin. The focus on thinness and dieting in our culture can make young girls, especially, vulnerable to falling into food restriction and subsequent emotional eating behavior. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Brynn |title=How to Stop Binge Eating |url=https://www.brynnjohnson.co/stop-binge-eating |website=Brynn Johnson Emotional Eating Coach |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional eating disorder predisposes individuals to more serious eating disorders and physiological complications. Therefore, combatting disordered eating before such progression takes place has become the focus of many [[clinical psychologist]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1627">Around 2006, the [[Government of China|Chinese Government]] instituted the admission of foreign students to [[China]] for medical instruction using [[English language|English]] as the language of instruction. Students are eligible to earn basic degrees in either Medicine ([[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]]) or Dentistry ([[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS]]).

To ensure adequate quality control, only a few choice medical schools are allowed specific quotas for admitting international students into these programs. Other Chinese medical institutions are not barred from admitting international students, but the government maintains that these other students would have to be admitted into the medical programs taught in [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://202.205.177.9/english/tongzhi_070810.htm Interim provisions for Quality Control Standards on Undergraduate Medical Education in English for International Students in China]&lt;/ref&gt;

This list of universities is reviewed each year and currently{{when?|date=May 2018}} stands at 50 schools.

These schools are thus officially recognized by the [[Avicenna Directories|WHO]] and the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|MOE]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26350">The '''history of medical cannabis''' goes back to ancient times. Ancient physicians in many parts of the world mixed [[cannabis]] into medicines to treat pain and other ailments. In the 19th century, cannabis was introduced for therapeutic use in Western Medicine. Since then, there have been several advancements in how the drug is administered. Initially, cannabis was reduced to a powder and mixed with wine for administration. In the 1970's, synthetic [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] was created to be administered as the drug [[Dronabinol|Marinol]] in a capsule. However, the main mode of administration for cannabis is smoking because its effects are almost immediate when the smoke is inhaled. Between 1996 and 1999, eight U.S. states supported cannabis prescriptions opposing policies of the federal government. Most people who are prescribed marijuana for medical purposes use it to alleviate severe pain.
== Ancient China ==
[[File:Da-ma.png|thumb|"Dàmá", the Chinese word for "cannabis", compounds "big; great" and "cannabis; hemp."]]
Cannabis, called ''má'' [[wikt: 麻|麻]] (meaning "hemp; cannabis; numbness") or ''dàmá'' [[Wikt:大麻|大麻]] (with "big; great") in Chinese, was used in [[Taiwan]] for fiber starting about 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Ernest L. |last=Abel |year=1980 |chapter=Cannabis in the Ancient World |chapterurl=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/history/first12000/1.htm |title=Marihuana: the first twelve thousand years |publisher=Plenum Publishers |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-306-40496-2}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The botanist [[Hui-lin Li]] wrote that in China, "The use of Cannabis in medicine was probably a very early development. Since ancient humans used hemp seed as food, it was quite natural for them to also discover the medicinal properties of the plant."&lt;ref&gt;Li, Hui-Lin (1974). "An Archaeological and Historical Account of Cannabis in China", ''Economic Botany'' 28.4:437–448, p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Chinese pharmacopeia, the (c. 100 AD) ''[[Shennong Bencaojing]]'' 神農本草經 ("[[Shennong]]'s [[Materia Medica]] Classic"), describes ''dama'' "cannabis".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The flowers when they burst (when the pollen is scattered) are called 麻蕡 [''mafen''] or 麻勃 [''mabo'']. The best time for gathering is the seventh day of the seventh month. The seeds are gathered in the ninth month. The seeds which have entered the soil are injurious to man. It grows in [[Mount Tai|&lt;nowiki&gt;[Taishan]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] (in [[Shandong|&lt;nowiki&gt;[Shandong]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] ...). The flowers, the fruit (seed) and the leaves are [[officinal]]. The leaves and the fruit are said to be poisonous, but not the flowers and the kernels of the seeds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil Bretschneider|Bretschneider, Emil]] (1895). ''Botanicon Sinicum: Notes on Chinese Botany from Native and Western Sources. Part III, Botanical Investigations in the Materia Medica of the Ancient Chinese''. Kelly &amp; Walsh. [https://books.google.com/books?id=256gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA378&amp;lpg=PA378#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 378].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The early Chinese surgeon [[Hua Tuo]] (c. 140-208) is credited with being the first recorded person to use cannabis as an [[anesthesia|anesthetic]]. He reduced the plant to powder and mixed it with wine for administration prior to conducting surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=de Crespigny |first=Rafe |year=2007 |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23–220 AD) |location=[[Leiden]] |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |isbn=978-90-04-15605-0 |page=332 |oclc=71779118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term for "anesthesia" (''mázui'' 麻醉) literally means "cannabis intoxication". [[Elizabeth Wayland Barber]] says the Chinese evidence "proves a knowledge of the narcotic properties of ''Cannabis'' at least from the 1st millennium B.C." when ''ma'' was already used in a secondary meaning of "numbness; senseless." "Such a strong drug, however, suggests that the Chinese pharmacists had now obtained from far to the southwest not THC-bearing ''Cannabis sativa'' but ''Cannabis indica'', so strong it knocks you out cold.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Elizabeth Wayland. (1992). ''Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean''. Princeton University Press. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch sinologist [[Frank Dikötter]]'s history of drugs in China says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The medical uses were highlighted in a pharmacopeia of the Tang, which prescribed the root of the plant to remove a blood clot, while the juice from the leaves could be ingested to combat tapeworm. The seeds of cannabis, reduced to powder and mixed with rice wine, were recommended in various other materia medica against several ailments, ranging from constipation to hair loss. The Ming dynasty ''Mingyi bielu'' provided detailed instructions about the harvesting of the heads of the cannabis sativa plant (''mafen'', ''mabo''), while the few authors who acknowledged hemp in various pharmacopoeias seemed to agree that the resinous female flowering heads were the source of dreams and revelations. After copious consumption, according to the ancient ''Shennong bencaojing'', one could see demons and walk like a madman, even becoming 'in touch with the spirits' over time. Other medical writers warned that ghosts could be seen after ingesting a potion based on raw seeds blended with calamus and podophyllum (''guijiu'').&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank, Lars Laamann, and Zhou Xun (2004), '' Narcotic Culture: A History of Drugs in China'', University Of Chicago Press, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cannabis is one of the [[50 Fundamental Herbs|50 "fundamental" herbs]] in [[traditional Chinese medicine]],&lt;ref name="Wong"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wong |first=Ming |year=1976 |title=La Médecine chinoise par les plantes |publisher=Tchou |location=Paris |oclc=2646789}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is prescribed to treat diverse indications. FP Smith writes in ''Chinese Materia Medica: Vegetable Kingdom'': &lt;blockquote&gt;Every part of the hemp plant is used in medicine ... The flowers are recommended in the 120 different forms of (風 ''feng'') disease, in menstrual disorders, and in wounds. The achenia, which are considered to be poisonous, stimulate the nervous system, and if used in excess, will produce hallucinations and staggering gait. They are prescribed in nervous disorders, especially those marked by local anaesthesia. The seeds ... are considered to be tonic, [[demulcent]], alternative [restorative], [[laxative]], [[emmenagogue]], [[diuretic]], [[anthelmintic]], and corrective. ... They are prescribed internally in fluxes, post-partum difficulties, [[aconitine|aconite]] poisoning, [[vermilion|vermillion]] poisoning, constipation, and obstinate vomiting. Externally they are used for eruptions, [[ulcer]]s, [[favus]], wounds, and falling of the hair. The oil is used for falling hair, sulfur poisoning, and dryness of the throat. The leaves are considered to be poisonous, and the freshly expressed juice is used as an [[anthelmintic]], in scorpion stings, to stop the hair from falling out and to prevent it from turning gray. ... The stalk, or its bark, is considered to be diuretic ... The juice of the root is ... thought to have a beneficial action in retained placenta and post-partum hemorrhage. An infusion of hemp ... is used as a demulcent drink for quenching thirst and relieving fluxes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Frederick Porter (1911). ''Chinese Materia Medica: Vegetable Kingdom''. Shanghai: American Presbyterian Mission Press. pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Ancient Netherlands ==
In 2007, a [[Neolithic Europe|late Neolithic]] grave attributed to the [[Beaker culture]] (found near {{Interlanguage link multi|Hattemerbroek|nl}}, [[Gelderland]]; dated 2459-2203 BCE) was found containing an unusually large concentration of [[pollen]]. After five years of careful investigation these pollen were concluded to be mostly cannabis along with a smaller amount of [[meadowsweet]]. Due to the fever-reducing properties of meadowsweet, the archeologists speculated that the person in the grave had likely been very ill, in which case the cannabis would have served as [[painkiller]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nu.nl/wetenschap/2784173/cannabis-van-4200-jaar-oud-in-graf-hanzelijn.html Cannabis van 4200 jaar oud in graf Hanzelijn (Dutch)], ''[[NU.nl]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient India ==
Cannabis was a major component in religious practices in ancient India as well as in medicinal practices. For many centuries, most parts of life in ancient India incorporated cannabis of some form.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloomquist|first=Edward|title=Marijuana: The Second Trip|year=1971|publisher=Glencoe Press|location=California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving texts from [[History of India|ancient India]] confirm that cannabis' psychoactive properties were recognized, and doctors used it for treating a variety of illnesses and ailments. These included insomnia, headaches, a whole host of gastrointestinal disorders, and pain: cannabis was frequently used to relieve the pain of childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02791072.1981.10471447 |title=The Religious and Medicinal Uses of Cannabis in China, India and Tibet |year=1981 |last1=Touw |first1=Mia |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |volume=13 |pages=23–34 |pmid=7024492 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Indian philosopher expressed his views on the nature and uses of bhang (a form of cannabis), which combined religious thought with medical practices. "A guardian lives in the bhang leaf. …To see in a dream the leaves, plant, or water of bhang is lucky. …A longing for bhang foretells happiness. It cures dysentry and sunstroke, clears phlegm, quickens digestion, sharpens appetite, makes the tongue of the lisper plain, freshens the intellect and gives alertness to the body and gaiety to the mind. Such are the useful and needful ends for which in His goodness the Almighty made bhang."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

== Ancient Greece ==
[[File:Cavalcade frieze Parthenon (1) BM.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ancient Greeks]] used cannabis not only for human medicine, but also in [[veterinary medicine]] to dress wounds and sores on their horses.&lt;ref name="hawthorne"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J175v02n02_04 |title=The Medical Use of Cannabis Among the Greeks and Romans |year=2002 |last1=Butrica |first1=James L. |journal=Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics |volume=2 |issue=2 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The [[Ancient Greeks]] used cannabis to dress wounds and sores on their horses.&lt;ref name="hawthorne"/&gt; In humans, dried leaves of cannabis were used to treat nose bleeds, and cannabis seeds were used to expel tapeworms.&lt;ref name="hawthorne"/&gt; The most frequently described use of cannabis in humans was to steep green seeds of cannabis in either water or wine, later taking the seeds out and using the warm extract to treat inflammation and pain resulting from obstruction of the ear.&lt;ref name="hawthorne"/&gt;

In the 5th century BC [[Herodotus]], a Greek historian, described how the [[Scythians]] of the Middle East used cannabis in steam baths. These baths drove the people to a frenzied state.&lt;ref name="hawthorne"/&gt;

== Medieval Islamic world ==
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], [[Islamic medicine|Arabic physicians]] made use of the [[diuretic]], [[antiemetic]], [[antiepileptic]], [[anti-inflammatory]], [[analgesic]] and [[antipyretic]] properties of ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'', and used it extensively as medication from the 8th to 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J175v01n01_05 |title=The Therapeutic Use of Cannabis sativa (L.) in Arabic Medicine |year=2001 |last1=Lozano |first1=Indalecio |journal=Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics |volume=1 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 19th century, medical interest in the use of cannabis began to grow in the West.&lt;ref name="bbchistory"/&gt; In the 19th century cannabis was one of the secret ingredients in several so called [[patent medicine]]s. There were at least 2000 cannabis medicines prior to 1937, produced by over 280 manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiquecannabisbook.com/ The Antique Cannabis Book]. antiquecannabisbook.com (16 March 2012). Retrieved 2012-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the syringe and injectable medicines contributed to an eventual decline in the popularity of cannabis for therapeutic uses, as did the invention of new drugs such as [[aspirin]].&lt;ref name="bbchistory"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/1632726.stm |title=History of Cannabis |publisher=BBC News |date=2 November 2001 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Irish physician, [[William Brooke O'Shaughnessy]], is credited with introducing the therapeutic use of cannabis to Western medicine. He was Assistant-Surgeon and Professor of Chemistry at the Medical College of [[Calcutta]], and conducted a cannabis experiment in the 1830s, first testing his preparations on animals, then administering them to patients to help treat muscle spasms, stomach cramps or general pain.&lt;ref name=Mack&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alison Mack|author2=Janet Joy|title=Marijuana As Medicine?: The Science Beyond the Controversy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZriSkC7aQOEC&amp;pg=PA15|date=7 December 2000|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-06531-3|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern medical and scientific inquiry began with doctors like [[William Brooke O'Shaughnessy|O'Shaughnessy]] and [[Jacques-Joseph Moreau de Tours|Moreau de Tours]], who used it to treat [[melancholia]] and [[migraine]]s, and as a sleeping aid, analgesic and [[anticonvulsant]]. At the local level authorities introduced various laws that required the mixtures that contained cannabis, that was not sold on prescription, must be marked with warning labels under the so-called poison laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Newsweekly for Pharmacy |journal=[[Chemist + Druggist]] |volume=28 |publisher=Benn Brothers |year=1886 |location=London, New York City, Melbourne |pages=68, 330 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiPOAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 [[Samuel Hopkins Adams]] published an exposé entitled "[[The Great American Fraud]]" in ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' about the [[patent medicines]] that led to the passage of the first [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great American Fraud (4th ed., 1907) |last=Adams |first=Samuel Hopkins |authorlink=Samuel Hopkins Adams |year=1905 |publisher=American Medical Association |location=Chicago |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oH0xqp0M-U0C |accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[statute]] did not ban the alcohol, narcotics, and stimulants in the medicines; rather, it required medicinal products to be labeled as such and curbed some of the more misleading, overstated, or [[fraud]]ulent claims that previously appeared on labels.

At the turn of the 20th century the Scandinavian [[maltose]]- and cannabis-based drink ''[[Maltos-Cannabis]]'' was widely available in Denmark and Norway.&lt;ref name=maltos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Kalmar|url=http://magasin.kb.se:8080/searchinterface/page.jsp?issue_id=kb:217421&amp;sequence_number=4&amp;recordNumber=3104&amp;totalRecordNumber=12448|date=1894-07-08|page=4|language=sv|title=Hurudan är Extract af Maltos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted as "an excellent lunch drink, especially for children and young people", the product had won a prize at the [[Exposition Internationale d'Anvers (1894)|Exposition Internationale d'Anvers]] in 1894.&lt;ref name=maltos/&gt; A Swedish encyclopedia from 1912 claim that European hemp, the raw material for Maltos-Sugar, almost lacked the narcotic effect that is typical for Indian hemp and that products from Indian hemp was abandon by modern science for medical use. Maltos-Cannabis was promoted with text about its content of [[maltose]] sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nf/hasjisj.htm |title=Hasjisj, Nordisk familjebok, 1912 |publisher=Runeberg.org |date=2016-01-17 |accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CannabisAmericana JLHopkins B.jpg|thumb|right |An advertisement for ''cannabis americana'' distributed by a pharmacist in New York in 1917]]

Later in the century, researchers investigating methods of detecting cannabis intoxication discovered that smoking the drug reduced [[intraocular pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zauberpilz.com/golden/g31-40.htm |title=Golden Guide |publisher=zauberpilz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2013}} In 1955 the antibacterial effects were described at the [[Palacký University of Olomouc]]. Since 1971 [[Lumír Ondřej Hanuš]] was growing cannabis for his scientific research on two large fields in authority of the University. The marijuana extracts were then used at the University hospital as a cure for aphthae and haze.&lt;ref name="blisty1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blisty.cz/art/42801.html |title=Nad léčivými jointy s Lumírem Hanušem |accessdate=2011-05-03 |publisher=blisty.cz|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 physician [[Tod H. Mikuriya]] reignited the debate concerning cannabis as medicine when he published "Marijuana Medical Papers". High intraocular pressure causes blindness in [[glaucoma]] patients, so he hypothesized that using the drug could prevent blindness in patients.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Many [[Vietnam War]] veterans also found that the drug prevented muscle spasms caused by spinal injuries suffered in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In 1964, Dr. Albert Lockhart and [[Manley West]] began studying the health effects of traditional cannabis use in [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] communities. They discovered that [[Rastafarian]]s had unusually low glaucoma rates and local fishermen were washing their eyes with cannabis extract in the belief that it would improve their sight. Lockhart and West developed, and in 1987 gained permission to market, the pharmaceutical [[Canasol]]: one of the first cannabis extracts. They continued to work with cannabis, developing more pharmaceuticals and eventually receiving the [[Jamaican Order of Merit]] for their work.&lt;ref name="FFY"&gt;Dr Farid F. Youssef. "Cannibis Unmasked: What it is and why it does what it does". UWIToday: June 2010. http://sta.uwi.edu/uwitoday/archive/june_2010/article9.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in the 1970s, a [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] version of [[THC]] was produced and approved for use in the United States as the drug [[Marinol#Marinol|Marinol]]. It was delivered as a capsule, to be swallowed. Patients complained that the violent nausea associated with chemotherapy made swallowing capsules difficult. Further, along with ingested cannabis, capsules are harder to [[titration|dose-titrate]] accurately than smoked cannabis because their onset of action is so much slower. Smoking has remained the route of choice for many patients because its onset of action provides almost immediate relief from symptoms and because that fast onset greatly simplifies titration. For these reasons, and because of the difficulties arising from the way cannabinoids are metabolized after being ingested, oral dosing is probably the least satisfactory route for cannabis administration.&lt;ref name="Lancet2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baker D, Pryce G, Giovannoni G, Thompson AJ |title=The therapeutic potential of cannabis |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=291–8 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12849183 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(03)00381-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, some studies have indicated that at least some of the beneficial effects that cannabis can provide may derive from [[synergy]] among the multiplicity of cannabinoids and other chemicals present in the dried plant material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J175v01n03_08 |title=Cannabis and cannabis extracts: greater than the sum of their parts? |year=2001 |last1=McPartland |first1=John M. |last2=Russo |first2=Ethan B. |journal=Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics |volume=1 |issue=3–4 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the more than 108,000 persons in Colorado who in 2012 had received a certificate to use marijuana for medical purposes, 94% said that severe pain was the reason for the requested certificate, followed by 3% for cancer and 1% for HIV/Aids. The typical card holder was a 41-year-old male. Twelve doctors had issued 50% of the certificates. Opponents of the card system claim that most card holders are drug abusers who are faking or exaggerating their illnesses; three-fourths male patients is not the normal pattern for pain patients, it is the normal pattern for drug addicts, claim the critics. After the implementation of medical cannabis in Colorado has also the past 30-day use of marijuana by teens increased significant compared with the average in the U.S. (Prescription to teens is not allowed in Colorado).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cannabistherapyinstitute.com/legal/colorado/audit/audit.2194B.MMJ.Part2.June.2013.pdf Medical Marijuana Regulatory System, Part II.

==Early life and education==
After secondary school, Seehofer started working as civil servant in the local administration in [[Ingolstadt]].&lt;ref name="Horst Seehofer – Alpha male"&gt;Toby Vogel (5 February 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/alpha-male/ Horst Seehofer – Alpha male] ''[[Politico Europe|European Voice]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===Federal Minister and Member of the Bundestag (1980–2008)===
Seehofer served as member of the German federal parliament ([[Bundestag]]) from 1980 until 2008.

Seehofer was [[Federal Minister for Health and Social Security (Germany)|Federal Minister for Health and Social Security]] from 1992 to 1998 in the [[cabinet of Germany|cabinet]] of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]].

In 1993, Seehofer ordered that Germany's 117-year-old Federal Health Agency be dissolved following a review of how the government in the 1980s handled the cases of thousands of [[Haemophilia|hemophiliacs]] who were infected through blood contaminated with [[HIV]]. The Health Ministry took over the agency's responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/15/world/german-agency-says-it-erred-in-hiv-case.html German Agency Says It Erred in H.I.V. Case] ''[[New York Times]]'', 15 October 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Seehofer announced that Germany would contribute to an emergency fund for victims of the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Whitney (13 November 1993), [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/13/world/germany-to-pay-victims-in-aids-blood-scandal.html Germany to Pay Victims in AIDS Blood Scandal] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of the crisis, he came under considerable pressure to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Kinzer (5 November 1993), [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/world/fear-of-hiv-infected-blood-spreads-past-german-borders.html Fear of H.I.V.-Infected Blood Spreads Past German Borders] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2008-06-01 Angela Merkel und Horst Seehofer 01-045.JPG|thumb|left|Seehofer with Angela Merkel, 2008]]
Seehofer became deputy chairman of the [[CDU/CSU]] [[parliamentary group]] of the Bundestag in October 1998, which was led at the time by [[Wolfgang Schäuble]]. He served as Health Minister [[Ulla Schmidt]]'s counterpart in negotiating the cross-party healthcare bill of 2003. Because of his disagreement with CDU leader [[Angela Merkel]] on flat-rate contributions (''Gesundheitsprämie'') to the federal health insurance&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Benoit (17 October 2005), [https://www.ft.com/content/bc00844c-3a61-11da-b0d3-00000e2511c8 Angela Merkel’s cabinet] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; he resigned from his post on 22 November 2004 but remained the deputy chairman of the CSU and kept his mandate. After joining the ''Bundestag'' Seehofer kept his mandate as a directly elected delegate (''Direktkandidat'') from his [[Constituency]] [[Ingolstadt (electoral district)|Ingolstadt]]. At the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 federal election]] he received 65.9 percent of the votes in his district.

Seehofer was appointed [[Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection|Federal Minister of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection]] in the [[Cabinet Merkel I|cabinet]] of Angela Merkel and stayed in office from 2005 to 2008.

===Minister President of Bavaria (2008–2018)===
After his party lost more than 17% of the popular vote in the [[Bavaria state election, 2008|Bavarian state elections of 2008]], incumbent Minister-President [[Günther Beckstein]] and Chairman of the CSU, [[Erwin Huber]], announced their resignations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/09/30/uk-germany-csu-idUKTRE48T1TH20080930|title=Bavaria's CSU leader quits after election blow|publisher=Reuters|date=30 September 2008|accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/10/01/uk-germany-csu-idUKTRE4903TQ20081001|title=Second CSU leader quits, raising risks for Merkel|publisher=Reuters|date=1 October 2008|accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seehofer was quickly proposed as their successor. At a party convention on 25 October he was affirmed as the new Chairman of the CSU with 90% of the votes, and on 27 October he was elected Minister-President by the [[Landtag of Bavaria|Landtag]] with votes from the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], forming the first [[coalition]] government in Bavaria since 1962.

During the term 2011–2012, Seehofer served as [[President of the German Bundesrat]]. As such, he acted as Acting [[President of Germany]] between [[Christian Wulff]]'s resignation on 17 February 2012&lt;ref name="bundesratspraesident"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_235/nn_6898/DE/presse/pm/2012/024-2012.html?__nnn=true|title=Bundesratspräsident nimmt Befugnisse des Bundespräsidenten wahr|publisher=Bundesrat|date=17 February 2012|accessdate=2012-02-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811043315/http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_235/nn_6898/DE/presse/pm/2012/024-2012.html?__nnn=true|archivedate=11 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wullf resigns"&gt;{{cite web|title=President Wulff resigns|url=http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20120217-40809.html|publisher=[[The Local]]|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/nach-wullf-ruecktritt-staatsoberhaupt-seehofer-1.1287416|title=Staatsoberhaupt Seehofer|language=German|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=18 February 2012|accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/muenchen/article13873734/Horst-Seehofer-ist-kommissarisches-Staatsoberhaupt.html|title=Horst Seehofer ist kommissarisches Staatsoberhaupt|language=German|publisher=Welt Online|date=17 February 2012|accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/news/2012-02/17/bundespraesident-portraet-seehofer-kommissarisches-staatsoberhaupt-17122211|title=Porträt: Seehofer kommissarisches Staatsoberhaupt|language=German|publisher=Zeit Online|date=17 February 2012|accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[German presidential election, 2012|election]] of [[Joachim Gauck]] on 18 March 2012.

Under Seehofer's leadership, the State of Bavaria took to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] in 2012 in order to dispute the legality of Germany's post-World War II system of financial redistribution among the country's 16 states. Bavaria, a beneficiary of the system until 1988, had paid more in 2011 than it got out in the 40 years it was a net recipient.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Buergin (17 July 2012), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-07-17/bavaria-to-challenge-germany-s-postwar-system-of-state-finances Bavaria to Challenge Germany’s Postwar System of State Finances] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The State of [[Hesse]], another per-capita contributor, joined the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph de Weck (5 February 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-05/two-richest-german-states-challenge-system-of-paying-for-poor Richest German States Challenge System of Paying for Poor] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also under Seehofer's leadership, the CSU won an absolute majority in the [[Bavarian state election, 2013|2013 state elections]], heralding strong momentum for the conservative parties in the [[German federal election, 2013|federal elections]] the following week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/bavarian-election-victory-for-conservatives-gives-merkel-a-boost-a-922407.html CSU Triumph: Bavarian Vote Gives Merkel Pre-Election Boost] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', 16 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Angela Merkel and [[Sigmar Gabriel]], he later led the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] on the national level. In late 2013, Seehofer won a record 95.3 percent of the party's votes to continue as chairman.&lt;ref name="Paul Carrel 2015"&gt;Paul Carrel (30 October 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/30/us-germany-coalition-idUSKCN0SO1CJ20151030 Horst Seehofer: Merkel ally turned menace-in-chief] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015, under pressure from younger rivals, Seehofer announced he would retire at the next state elections in 2018.&lt;ref name="Stefan Wagstyl 2015"&gt;Stefan Wagstyl (7 October 2015), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9cc055a8-6c24-11e5-aca9-d87542bf8673.html Bavarian ally proves a thorn in Merkel’s side on refugees] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, when was chosen the fifth time as leader of the CSU, he received 87.2 percent of the vote, some 8 percent down on the result he achieved in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/bavarian-premier-seehofer-re-elected-csu-party-leader/a-18866331 Bavarian premier Seehofer re-elected CSU party leader] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 21 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reuven Rivlin visit to Germany, September 2017 (3410).jpg|thumb|Horst Seehofer and Israeli President [[Reuven Rivlin]], 2017]]
In August 2016, Seehofer said he may break with party unity and run a separate campaign in the [[German federal election, 2017|2017 national elections]], a move widely seen as an effort to keep pressure on Merkel to shift to a more restrictive refugee policy in the [[European migrant crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Buergin (1 August 2016), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-01/merkel-s-bavarian-ally-hints-at-snub-of-chancellor-in-2017-vote Merkel’s Bavarian Ally Hints at Snub of Chancellor in 2017 Vote] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also announced to stay on as CSU leader beyond 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Joern Poltz and Paul Carrel (24 April 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics/merkel-ally-seehofer-staying-on-for-difficult-german-election-idUSKBN17Q1EF Merkel ally Seehofer staying on for 'difficult' German election] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; When the CSU's share of the vote in Bavaria fell 10 percentage points compared with 2013, to below 39 per cent, Seehofer faced demands to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Chazan (27 September 2017), [https://www.ft.com/content/b1e1493c-a35f-11e7-b797-b61809486fe2 Bavarian party chief faces resignation calls over poll result] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 December 2017, he announced to step down as Minister President and not running as leading candidate in the 2018 state elections;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Chazan (4 December 2017), [https://www.ft.com/content/421ba572-d8e6-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482 Bavarian PM Horst Seehofer steps down in CSU power struggle] ''[[Handelsblatt]]''&lt;/ref&gt; instead, he said he would hand over the office to [[Markus Söder]] in the first quarter of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Schultheis (4 December 2017), [https://www.politico.eu/article/horst-seehofer-to-step-down-as-bavarian-state-premier-csu-germany-elections/ Seehofer to quit as Bavarian premier to end power struggle] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 2018, Seehofer confirmed that he will be in Merkel's cabinet if the SPD party members vote in favour of the coalition.&lt;ref name="CSU's Horst Seehofer confirms he will join Angela Merkel's cabinet"&gt;{{cite news|title=CSU's Horst Seehofer confirms he will join Angela Merkel's cabinet|url=http://www.dw.com/en/csus-horst-seehofer-confirms-he-will-join-angela-merkels-cabinet/a-42793190|accessdate=16 March 2018|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took over the role of Interior Minister.&lt;ref name="CSU's Horst Seehofer confirms he will join Angela Merkel's cabinet"/&gt; A policy Seehofer announced is that he has a "master plan for faster asylum procedures, and more consistent deportations."&lt;ref name="Germany's future interior minister Horst Seehofer vows to increase deportations"&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany's future interior minister Horst Seehofer vows to increase deportations|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-future-interior-minister-horst-seehofer-vows-to-increase-deportations/a-42925097|accessdate=16 March 2018|publisher=Deusche Welle|date=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wants a "zero tolerance" policy toward criminals.&lt;ref name="Germany's future interior minister Horst Seehofer vows to increase deportations"/&gt; On 15 March 2018, Seehoher stated that he disagreed with the belief that the Islamic faith is part of German culture.&lt;ref name="Islam doesn't belong to Germany"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staudenmaier|first=Rebecca|title=German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer: 'Islam doesn't belong to Germany'|url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-interior-minister-horst-seehofer-islam-doesnt-belong-to-germany/a-42999726|accessdate=16 March 2018|publisher=Deusche Welle|date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that certain public holidays correspond to certain church holidays.&lt;ref name="Islam doesn't belong to Germany"/&gt;

In June 2018, Seehofer backed down from a threat to bypass Chancellor Angela Merkel in a disagreement over immigration policy Until she comes back on July 1 during while she attempts to find a solution at European level.

Under Seehofer plan Germany would rejected migrants who have already been deported or have an entry ban and would instruct police to turn away all migrants who have registered elsewhere in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/germany-interior-minister-merkel-ultimatum-migrants-180618093627915.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/germany-s-interior-minister-horst-seehofer-wants-quick-action-on-migra-dgtl-238561&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2018, Seehofer offered to resign after rejecting Chancellor Angela Merkel's EU migration deal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/merkel-coalition-crisis-seehofer-offers-quit-migration-180702052457364.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44674945&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/merkel-fights-to-save-coalition-from-division-over-migration&lt;/ref&gt;  On 2 July 2018, however, Seehofer and Merkel announced they had settled their differences and agreed to instead accept a compromise of tighter border control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/merkel-faces-showdown-over-migrant-policy-1530539359 Germany’s Merkel Secures Deal on Migrants, Averts Government Collapse] The Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadine Schmidt and Judith Vonberg (2&amp;nbsp;July 2018).

[[CNN International| CNN International Edition]]. edition.cnn.com. Retrieved 2018-07-03.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the agreement, Seehofer agreed to not resign.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44685727&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
[[File:2013-04-11 Horst Seehofer (Landtag) 102.JPG|thumb|Seehofer, seated in the [[Landtag of Bavaria]] in 2013]]

===Immigration===
In 2010, remarks made by Seehofer according to which Turkish and Arab migrants were no longer needed in Germany were strongly criticized by the Turkish community and by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Dempsey (11 October 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/world/europe/12iht-germany.html German Politician Makes Anti-Immigrant Remarks] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Seehofer took the debate further when he said those who wanted to stay in Germany should be ready to sign up to German values. He proposed a change to the Bavarian Constitution so that the authorities in the state would be under obligation to help with the integration process but that minorities, too, should be prepared to actively support the integration process.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Judy Dempsey (9 March 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/world/europe/10iht-germany10.html Merkel Ally Assails Turkey on Human Rights] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, Seehofer and the CSU sharply criticized Chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee policy, as the party's home turf of Bavaria was the main entry point for refugees and other migrants arriving in Germany.&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; Under pressure from Seehofer and his allies, Merkel later restricted cash benefits for refugees and added [[Kosovo]], [[Albania]] and [[Montenegro]] to the list of "safe" countries to which migrants can be returned.&lt;ref name="Stefan Wagstyl 2015"/&gt; He repeatedly called on the federal government to set a cap on the number of refugees Germany should be taking in,&lt;ref name="Ruth Bender 2016"/&gt; saying that the country was able to manage only "200,000 applicants [per year] for asylum … at the most."&lt;ref&gt;Janosch Delcker (6 January 2016), [http://www.politico.eu/article/merkel-seehofer-play-nice-cdu-csu-trouble-coalition-migration-refugees/ Merkel and Seehofer play nice, but alliance is under strain] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Seehofer later threatened to file a complaint against the government's refugee policy with Germany's [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Constitutional Court]].&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Seehofer is opposed to [[Turkey]]'s becoming a member of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; In 2009, he stated that Turkey "as a self-proclaimed representative of the Muslim world, clearly doesn't fit in".&lt;ref name="ft.com"&gt;Ben Hall and Chris Bryant (9 April 2009), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c46c2286-249f-11de-9a01-00144feabdc0.html France and Germany play politics with accession] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010 and November 2011, Seehofer was the first Minister-President of Bavaria who visited the neighbouring [[Czech Republic]]; this was considered an important step in the dispute over the expulsion of the [[Sudeten Germans]] after the Second World War. In February 2013, Seehofer received [[Petr Nečas]] as the first Czech Prime Minister for an official visit to Bavaria.

In an interview with news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in late 2014, Seehofer warned Germany's foreign minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] and his fellow Social Democrats ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) against pursuing a more friendly approach towards Russia in the [[Ukraine crisis 2014|Ukrainian crisis]], arguing that "if Mr. Steinmeier is pursuing his own form of diplomacy alongside the chancellor, that would be highly dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Nienaber (22 November 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/22/ukraine-crisis-germany-russia-idUSL6N0TC0MO20141122#LxlKwHRYYiCpHkuB.97 Merkel ally warns SPD against own diplomacy towards Russia] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Wagstyl and Roula Khalaf (26 November 2014), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/93e5e066-757a-11e4-b1bf-00144feabdc0.html Merkel offers Russia trade talks olive branch] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that, even within his own party, there was already too much friendly sentiment towards Russia that had to be kept in check.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaus Blome, Peter Müller, Christian Neef, Ralf Neukirch and Christoph Schult (25 November 2014), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/german-government-shows-faults-in-stance-on-russia-a-1004754.html Relations at Rock Bottom: Cracks Form in Berlin Over Russia Stance] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2015, he held that it would be "[[Realpolitik]]" to try to involve Russia in tackling global crises.&lt;ref&gt;Arne Delfs (21 November 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-21/merkel-s-bavarian-ally-plans-putin-visit-in-bid-for-global-stage Merkel's Bavarian Ally Plans Putin Visit in Bid for Global Stage] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2016, his joint visit with [[Edmund Stoiber]] to Moscow for talks with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] was met by harsh criticism, even from CDU politicians.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt; By early 2017, Seehofer reiterated his calls to lift the [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|EU sanctions]] against Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Shalal (28 January 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-germany-idUSKBN15D005 Merkel's Bavarian ally calls for quick end to Russian sanctions] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, a few days after [[2018 Chemnitz protests|Chemnitz protests against migrants and refugees]], Seehofer criticized the debate on migration again saying it is "the mother of all political problems" in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/migration-mother-of-all-political-problems-says-german-interior-minister-horst-seehofer/a-45378092|title=Migration 'mother of all political problems,' says German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer {{!}} DW {{!}} 06.09.2018|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European integration===
In 2012, Seehofer demanded that the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]] be changed to permit [[referendum]]s on decisions to deepen [[European integration]] and transfer powers to [[Institutions of the European Union|European institutions]]. That same year, he criticized [[International Monetary Fund]] managing director [[Christine Lagarde]]'s proposal for measures that would result in a mutualization of [[Eurozone]] debt, arguing that shared liability for [[sovereign debt]] and a banking union would remove pressure from governments to carry out economic policy changes.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Buergin (29 June 2012), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-29/lagarde-wrong-to-urge-mutualized-debt-germany-s-seehofer-says Lagarde Wrong to Urge Mutualized Debt, Germany’s Seehofer Says] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Seehofer made [[Peter Gauweiler]] a deputy leader of the CSU in a bid to court the party's euro critics; however, Gauweiler quit after two years in protest against the extension of [[Greece]]'s aid program.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Buergin and Patrick Donahue (31 March 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-31/euro-critic-quits-merkel-s-german-coalition-in-protest German Euro Critic Quits Merkel Caucus in Greece Protest] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2018">In [[human geography]], '''McNeill's law''' is the process outlined in [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill's]] book ''Plagues and Peoples''.  The process described concerns the role of [[pathogens|microbial disease]] in the conquering of people-groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plagues and People |last= McNeill |first=William |isbn=978-1439503133 |page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to McNeill's Law, the microbiological aspect of conquest and invasion has been the deciding principle or one of the deciding principles in both the expansion of certain [[empire]]s (as during the emigration to the Americas) and the containment in others (as during the [[crusades]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/1008/features/a-germ-of-an-idea.shtml | title=A germ of an idea | publisher=[[University of Chicago]] Alumni Association | work=University of Chicago Magazine | date=July–August 2010 | accessdate=May 3, 2016 | author=Goodier, Robert | issn=0041-9508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instances in history==
The first people-group fully [[genocide|wiped out]] due to [[Age of Exploration|European expansion]] (with the possible exception of the [[Arawaks]]) was the [[Guanches]] of the [[Canary Islands]].  Despite an inbred ferocity, superior knowledge of the land and even a possible tactical superiority, they were eventually wiped out through the concentrated efforts of the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]].  McNeill's Law would place the deciding factor squarely on the introduction of deadly diseases and parasites from the mainland to the previously geographically isolated islanders.

This is the likely explanation, as what records still exist show numerous deaths by disease on the islands and a declining birth-rate, leading eventually to the almost complete end of the Guanches as a race.

Other instances include the devastation of the [[Incas]] by [[smallpox]].

'''Methylcholanthrene''' is a highly [[carcinogen]]ic [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] produced by burning [[organic compound]]s at very high temperatures{{Clarify|date=February 2009| title = 3-methylcholanthrene}}.  Methylcholanthrene is also known as 3-methylcholanthrene, 20-methylcholanthrene or the IUPAC name 3-methyl-1,2-dyhydrobenzo[j]aceanthrylene. The short notation often used is '''3-MC''' or '''MCA'''. This compound forms pale yellow solid crystals when crystallized from benzene and ether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| URL =  https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3-methylcholanthrene#section=Top| title = 3-methylcholanthrene}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a melting point around 180&amp;nbsp;°C and its boiling point is around 280&amp;nbsp;°C at a pressure of 80 mmHg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Lide, D. R.| title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 88th Edition| year = 2007| page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Methylcholanthrene is used in laboratory studies of chemical carcinogenesis. It is an alkylated derivative of [[benz(a)anthracene|benz[''a'']anthracene]] and has a similar UV spectrum.  The most common isomer is 3-methylcholanthrene, although the [[methyl group]] can occur in other places.

3-Methylcholanthrene, a known carcinogen which builds up in the prostate due to [[cholesterol]] breakdown, is implicated in [[prostate cancer]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  It "readily produces" primary [[sarcomas]] in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Development of a Cancer DNA Phenotype Prior to Tumor Formation |author1=Donald C.

== History ==
In 1933, the first article about methylcholanthrene was published. Here they described the synthesis of the compound. Not many years later, it became clear that this compound had toxic properties to humans and animals. Therefore, a lot of interest was shown in the compound and it was used often in [[toxicology|toxicological]] research. Methylcholanthrene is often tested on mice and rats to derive information for cancer medicine development. Due to the influence of the compound on the [[central nervous system]], its responses and change in response are compared. It is also known that due to genetic mutations, the compound causes cancer cells to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duran-Reynals |first1=M. L. |last2=Stanley |first2=B. |date=1961-12-15 |title=Vaccinia dermal infection and methylcholanthrene in cortisone-treated mice |journal=Science |volume=134 |issue=3494 |pages=1984–1985 |doi=10.1126/science.134.3494.1984 |pmid=13888610}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1982, the last article appeared on the synthesis of methylcholanthrene. The yield of 93% was reached and therefore no further adjustments were made to the synthesis scheme.

== Synthesis ==

First 3-MC was synthesized with the method of reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=J.W. Cook  |author2=G.A.D. Haslewood |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The synthesis of 5 : 6-dimethyl-1 : 2-benzanthraquinone, a degradation product of deoxycholic acid|journal = Journal of the Chemical Society| year = 1934| page = 428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the synthesis of the compound was improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jacobs, S. A. |author2=Harvey, R. G. | title = Synthesis of 3-methylcholanthrene| journal = Tetrahedron Letters| year = 1981| volume = 22| pages = 1093–1096}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Harvey, R. G. |author2=Cortez, C. |author3=Jacobs, S. A. | title = Synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via a novel annelation method| journal = The Journal of Organic Chemistry| year = 1982| volume = 47 |issue=11 | pages = 2120–2125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The synthesis of 3-MC consists of a few steps, visualized in figure 1; the first step is the key to success for the synthesis. 4-methylindanone (1) reacts in condensation with lithium salt of N,N-diethyl-1-naphthamide (2). At -60  ̊C the reaction of 1 and 2 afforded evenly to the lactone (3), the carbonyl addition product which underwent conversion on treatment with acid. The free acid (4) was obtained when the latter was cleaved reductively with zinc and alkali. Cyclization of the product occurred when treated with ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in acetic acid anhydride and gave the compound 6-acetoxy-3-MC (5). Reducing this product with hydriodic acid in propionic acid resulted in 3-MC.

== Mechanism ==
[[File:Methylchloranthrene mechanism.JPG|thumb|left|2.Methylcholanthrene mechanism]]
3-MC has an inhibitory function in a [[dimethylnitrosamine]] [[demethylase]] process in rat livers. Inhibition could happen on by interfering in demethylase conformations or by interfering in synthesis and/or degradation of demethylase. Experiments showed that the Km doesn’t change after 3-MC treatment. This strongly indicates that enzyme affinity is not influenced by 3-MC. Instead, incubation with 3-MC leads to a decrease in the amount of [[enzyme activity]]. These results point towards inhibition of demethylase synthesis and/or induction of demetylase degradation. Unpublished observations of Venkatesan, Argus and Arcos suggest that demethylase synthesis inhibition is most plausible.&lt;ref name="VenkatesanArgusArcos"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mechanism of 3-methylcholanthrene-induced inhibition of dimethylnitrosamine demethylase in rat liver |last1=Venkatesan |first1=Natarajan |last2=Argus |first2=Mary F. |last3=Arcos |first3=Joseph C. |year=1970 |journal=Cancer Research |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=2556–2562 |pmid=5474178 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/30/10/2556.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible mechanism for this reaction is depicted in figure (2). 3-MC is metabolized, via [[epoxidation]], [[hydrolysis]] and another epoxidation, to a very reactive epoxide. Epoxidations are realized by the enzyme [[cytochrome P450]]. The second epoxide is not hydrolysed immediately because it is localized next to a bay region, which shields the epoxide. This way, the metabolite is able to travel and bind to DNA in figure (2). The mechanism is derived from the binding mechanism of [[Benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]] to DNA. This is likely because it is plausible that two [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s are metabolized via the same pathway. [[Deoxyguanosine]] is used in the figure, since that base appears to be bound to Benzo[a]pyrene far more often than the other bases.&lt;ref name="VenkatesanArgusArcos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EastmanSweetenhamBresnick"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eastman |first1=Alan |last2=Sweetenham |first2=John |last3=Bresnick |first3=Edward |title=Comparison of in vivo and in vitro binding of polycyclic hydrocarbons to DNA |date=1978 |journal=Chemico-Biological Interactions |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=345–353 |doi=10.1016/0009-2797(78)90095-9 |pmid=719814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There appears to be an equilibrium in 3-MC-free and 3-MC-bound. It is hard to determine how when the equilibrium is formed due to difficulties with radioactive measurements. A probable saturating dosis is thought to be around 40&amp;nbsp;mg 3-MC/kg.&lt;ref name="VenkatesanArgusArcos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LasnitzkiBardFranklin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lasnitzki |first1=I. |last2=Bard |first2=D. R. |last3=Franklin |first3=H. R. |date=1975 |title=3-Methylcholanthrene uptake and metabolism in organ culture |journal=British Journal of Cancer |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=219–229 |doi=10.1038/bjc.1975.152 |pmc=2024855 |pmid=1240005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on the effect of 3-MC in rat uteri concludes that 3-MC acts as an estrogen antagonist. The sexhormone is, like 3-MC, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. 3-MC and estrogen bind to estrogenreceptors competitively, reducing the estrogen expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sheen |first1=Y. Y. |last2=Kim |first2=S. S. |last3=Yun |first3=H. C. |title=Effect of 3-methylcholanthrene on rat uterus: Uterine growth and mechanism of action of 3-methylcholanthrene |journal=Archives of Pharmacal Research |page=276 |volume=16 |doi=10.1007/bf02977516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolism==
MC is metabolized by rat liver microsomes into oxygenated forms which alkylate DNA. These oxygenated metabolites bind to double-stranded and single-stranded. Empirical data show that MC tends to bind mostly to G-bases8.&lt;ref name="DaubenMabee"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dauben |first1=William G. |last2=Mabee |first2=Dorothea |title=A Study of the Metabolism of 20-Methylcholanthrene |date=1951 |journal=Cancer Research |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=216–220 |pmid=14821965 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/11/3/216.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When injected in lung, kidney or liver tissue of rats, it appears that the liver is able to reverse the MC-binding to DNA. Lung and kidney tissue are not capable of doing this, which may explain why MC is more carcinogenic in lungs and kidneys than in the liver. To be carcinogenic, the MC metabolite has to be covalently bound to DNA. Therefor it’s necessary for MC to be oxygenated in order to carcinogenic.&lt;ref name="EastmanSweetenhamBresnick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LasnitzkiBardFranklin" /&gt;
Injected MC does not move away from the injection site. In a rat body MC has a half-life of about 4 weeks. After 8 weeks, 80% of MC is metabolized into water-soluble metabolites. MC and it’s metabolites mainly exit the body via feces (a ninefold more urine). Three months after injection with MC, 85% of the rats are reported to have tumors. 82% of the tumors is a form of spindle-cell sarcoma.&lt;ref name="DaubenMabee" /&gt;

==Efficacy==
Methylcholanthrene is often used to induce tumors in rodents for carcinogenesis and mutagenesis research. 
In a study from 1991, lung precancerous and cancerous lesions were induced in Wistar rats by one intrabronchial injection of 3-MC. After 30 days, atypical hyperplasia of bronchiolar epithelium, adenoid hyperplasia or adenomas, and squamous cell carcinoma occurred in 15 (88.2%), 12 (70.6%) and 3 (17.7%) out of 17 rats respectively. After 60 days, the incidences were 15/18 (83.3%), 4/17 (23.5%) and 7/18 (38.9%). All of the precancerous lesions and carcinomas showed positive expression of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=He, R. |title=Precancerous and cancerous lesions and their gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase expression in 3-methylcholanthrene-induced lung carcinogenesis in rats |journal=Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao |year=1991 |volume=13 |page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Jin et al. (2013) found that the cellular redox balance is altered by acute exposure to 3-MC. This causes the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-regulated response pathway to induce antioxidant responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jin Y. |author2=M. W. |author3=Lin X. |author4=Pan X. |author5=Ye Y. |author6=Xu M |author7=Fu Z. |title=Acute exposure to 3-methylcholanthrene induces hepatic oxidative stress via activation of the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway in mice |journal=Environmental Toxicology |volume=29 |year=2013 |page=1399 |doi=10.1002/tox.21870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==
3-MC is a ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which stimulates transcription directed by xenobiotic response elements. AhR ligands can induce formation of an AhR-estrogen receptor (ER) complex. 3-MC was found to elicit estrogenic activity by this mechanism, and by stimulation of the expression of some endogenous ER target genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shipley |first1=J. M. |last2=Waxman |first2=D.J. |title=Aryl hydrocarbon receptor-independent activation of estrogen receptor-dependent transcription by 3-methylcholanthrene |journal=Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology |year=2006 |volume=213 |page=87 |doi=10.1016/j.taap.2005.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
3-MC may cause respiratory tract irritation, skin irritation or eye irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/f?./temp/~UiCKMb:1 |title=TOXNET |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on animals==

===Effects on human===

3-MC is mutagenic to human cells. Curren et al. (1978) were the first to report successfully induced mutations in human cells with 3-MC. Skin epithelial cells are thought to metabolize the compound to mutagenic products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Curren |first1=R. D. |last2=Homer |first2=C.J. |last3=Price |first3=P.J. |last4=Freeman |first4=A.E. |title=Mutagenesis of human cells by 3-methylcholanthrene |journal=Mutation Research |year=1978 |volume=60 |page=109 |doi=10.1016/0027-5107(79)90214-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ability to metabolize mutagens may express genetically regulated differences within a species such as man or mouse, causing environmental chemicals to show a different level of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity to specific individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hutton |first1=J. J. |last2=Meier |first2=J. |last3=Hackney |first3=C. |title=Comparison of the in vitro mutagenicity and metabolism of dimethylnitrosamine and benzo[a]pyrene in tissues from inbred mice treated with phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene or polychlorinated biphenyls |journal=Mutation Research |year=1978 |volume=60 |page=90 |doi=10.1016/0165-1218(79)90010-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-human toxicity studies===

The administration of 3-MC to pregnant mice results in the formation of lung tumors in the offspring. Miller et al. (1990) compared the effects of fetal versus adult exposure to 3-MC on both induction of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity in lung and dependence of lung tumorigenesis on the Ah genotype. A single ip injection (in inducible fetal lung supernatants) of 100&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of 3-MC to the mothers resulted in a maximal 50-fold induction of AHH activity by 8 hr, which persisted for 48 hr. The same injections to adult F1 mice revealed only a 4- to 7—fold increase in lung AHH activity, compared to the large fetal induction ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=M. S. |last2=Jones |first2=A.B. |last3=Park |first3=S.S. |last4=Anderson |first4=L.M. |title=The formation of 3-methylcholanthrene-initiated lung tumors correlates with induction of cytochrome P450IA1 by the carcinogen in fetal but not in adult mice |journal=Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology |year=1990 |volume=104 |page=235 |doi=10.1016/0041-008x(90)90298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current technology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
Molecular processors are currently in their infancy and currently only a few exist. At present a basic molecular processor is any biological or chemical system that uses a [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA) template to form a long chain [[amino acid]] molecule. A key factor that differentiates molecular processors is "the ability to control output" of [[protein]] or [[peptide]] concentration as a function of time. Simple formation of a molecule becomes the task of a chemical reaction, bioreactor or other polymerization technology. Current molecular processors take advantage of cellular processes to produce amino acide based proteins and peptides. The formation of a molecular processor currently involves integrating cDNA into the [[genome]] and should not replicate and re-insert, or be defined as a [[virus]] after insertion. Current molecular processors are replication incompetent, non-communicable and cannot be transmitted from cell to cell, animal to animal or human to human. All must have a method to terminate if implanted. The most effective methodology for insertion of cDNA (template with control mechanism) uses capsid technology to insert a payload into the genome. A viable molecular processor is one that dominates cellular function by re-task and or reassignment but does not terminate the cell. It will continuously produce protein or produce on demand and have method to regulate dosage if qualifying as a "drug delivery" molecular processor. Potential applications range from up-regulation of functional [[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR]] in [[Cystic Fibrosis]] and Hemoglobin in Sickle Cell Anemia to [[angiogenesis]] in cardiovascular [[stenosis]] to account for protein deficiency (used in gene therapy.)

==Example==
A vector inserted to form a molecular processor is described in part. The objective was to promote angiogenesis, blood vessel formation and improve cardiovasculature. [[Vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.2479986|title=Vascular endothelial growth factor is a secreted angiogenic mitogen|pmid=2479986|year=1989|last1=Leung|first1=D.|last2=Cachianes|first2=G|last3=Kuang|first3=W.|last4=Goeddel|first4=D.|last5=Ferrara|first5=N|journal=Science|volume=246|issue=4935|pages=1306–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enhanced [[green fluorescent protein]] (EGFP) cDNA was ligated to either side of an internal ribosomal re-entry site (IRES) to produce inline production of both the VEGF and EGFP proteins. After in vitro insertion and quantification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0166-0934(98)00166-9|pmid=10204701|title=Rapid feline immunodeficiency virus provirus quantitation by polymerase chain reaction using the TaqMan fluorogenic real-time detection system|first9=H|last9=Lutz|first8=WH|last8=Guenzburg|first7=F|last7=Boretti|first6=J|last6=Böni|first5=U|last5=Hummel|first4=C|last4=Mislin|first3=R|last3=Hofmann-Lehmann|first2=D|year=1999|last2=Klein|last1=Leutenegger|first1=C|journal=Journal of Virological Methods|volume=78|issue=1–2|pages=105–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; of integrating units (IUs), engineered cells produce a bioluminescent marker and a chemotactic growth factor. In this instance, increased fluorescence of EGFP is used to show VEGF production in individual cells with active molecular processors.

A '''mouth prop''' (also '''bite block''') is a wedge-shaped implement used in [[dentistry]] for dentists working with children and other patients who have difficulty keeping their mouths open wide and steady during a procedure, or during procedures where the patient is sedated. It has a rubber-like texture and is typically made from [[thermoplastic vulcanizate]] (TPV) material.  They come in several different sizes, from pediatric to adult, and are typically ridged as to use the back teeth to hold them in place.

The '''panda crossing''' was a type of signal-controlled pedestrian crossing used in the [[United Kingdom]] from 1962 to 1967.

==Background==
In the early-1960s, the British [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]], headed by [[Ernest Marples]], was looking for a way to make pedestrian crossings safer under increasingly heavy traffic conditions. The successful [[zebra crossing]] design was not considered safe enough for busy roads and could create traffic delays as pedestrians crossed whenever they wanted. Off-the-shelf light-controlled systems were available but were too expensive for widespread use. Some cities had innovated their own one-off crossings but the lack of standardisation was considered a safety issue. Furthermore, all existing signalled crossings tended to have two major drawbacks: stopping traffic for long periods of time and appearing to violate contemporary [[Right-of-way (traffic)|right-of-way]] law by signalling "Don't cross" to pedestrians (in reality: the 'Don't Cross' indication was not a legally enforceable instruction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pedestrian Crossings: A Lesson in patience|url=http://www.roads.org.uk/articles/pedestrian-crossings/lesson-patience|website=Roads.org.uk |author=Chris Marshall |access-date=30 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The panda crossing was introduced in 1962 as an attempt to combine the best features of available and experimental crossing systems. The first public example was opened on 2 April of that year outside [[London Waterloo railway station]]. The majority of the initial sites used for this experiment were in [[Guildford]] where all thirteen existing crossings were converted, and in [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] where ten crossings were converted. Further sites across England and Wales increased the size of the experiment to more than forty sites in all.&lt;ref name="bbc-02Apr1962"&gt;{{cite web|title=1962: New pedestrian crossings cause chaos|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/2/newsid_2840000/2840919.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 May 2012|author=Associated Press|date=2 April 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and operation==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PandaLights.jpg|thumb|137px|The Panda's distinctive two-light signal head with striped [[Belisha beacon]] (the "STOP" text on the red light persisted through to early [[Pelican crossing|Pelican crossings)]]]] --&gt;
The layout was superficially similar to a traditional zebra crossing, with a painted area on the road announced by [[Belisha beacon]]s. For distinction, the panda road pattern was different (triangles rather than stripes) and the beacons were striped, not plain. The main additions were the light signals on the beacon poles. The traffic signals consisted of two lamps, red and amber, while the pedestrians had a single signal displaying the word "Cross" when appropriate.&lt;ref name="Roadsorguk Hairbrained"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pedestrian Crossings: Harebrained and Most Dangerous|url=http://www.roads.org.uk/articles/pedestrian-crossings/hairbrained-and-most-dangerous|website=Roads.org.uk |author=Chris Marshall |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the idle state, no lights were lit. A pedestrian wanting to cross would press a button on the beacon pole and be instructed to wait by an illuminated sign near the button. The system allowed for a pause between crossings in order to avoid traffic delays, and so the pedestrian might wait a while before anything happened. The amber traffic light would pulsate for a few seconds to inform motorists that someone was about to cross; a red light was then the signal to stop. At this point, the pedestrians' "Cross" signal began to flash. After a few seconds, the "Cross" light started to flash faster and the red traffic light was changed to a flashing amber (this "flashing" phase was considered distinct from the initial "pulsating" amber light).
&lt;ref name="bbc-02Apr1962" /&gt; The "Cross" light flashed increasingly fast as crossing time ran out, and the traffic was allowed to proceed during the flashing amber phase if the crossing was clear. Eventually, all lights were extinguished as the crossing reset. 

The panda crossing deliberately omitted any sort of "Don't cross" message for pedestrians in order to avoid breaching the aforementioned right-of-way laws. The measured pause between crossings helped to keep traffic flowing. The light sequence also prevented long delays by allowing traffic to move after a few seconds if nobody was crossing. However, despite its apparent rationality, the design was not a success. In particular, the distinction between the flashing and pulsating amber phases was subtle yet highly significant.&lt;ref name="Roadsorguk Hairbrained" /&gt;

==Successors==
By 1967, the panda crossing was a matter of concern for the [[Ministry of Transport]], and so a new type of crossing, the [[Pelican crossing#Details|X-way]], was introduced. The new system was not phased in gradually by replacement, rather the pandas were removed seemingly as a matter of urgency. The replacement was so urgent that although the X-way lights replaced the panda crossing lights, the road initially retained the black-and-white triangular markings until they could be removed at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary (and copyright) photograph of Guildford High Street shows X-way lights by Tunsgate Arch complete with triangle markings.&lt;/ref&gt; The X-way itself soon disappeared when, in 1969, the modern-day [[pelican crossing]] was introduced.

The '''Physiotherapists Tribunal''' is a former [[tribunal]] established in the [[Australia]]n [[States and territories of Australia|state]] of [[New South Wales]] which dealt with appeals and complaints of professional misconduct by [[physiotherapists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/Parlment/HansArt.nsf/V3Key/LA20010625042|title=Physiotherapists Bill - 25 June 2001 - 2R - NSW Parliament|publisher=Parliament.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=13 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524161408/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/Parlment/HansArt.nsf/V3Key/LA20010625042|archivedate=24 May 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;  

On 1 January 2014 the tribunal's functions were assumed by the newly established [[New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal]].

The tribunal generally heard matters after the Physiotherapists Board of New South Wales had made a decision, such as hearing an appeal against the cancellation of a physiotherapist’s registration.&lt;ref name=s18&gt;Physiotherapists Act 2001 (NSW)&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunal heard matters in an informal manner in an attempt to do justice in the matter. The tribunal also conducted inquiries into complaints referred by the [[Health Care Complaints Commission|New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission]].

In common with other health professionals in New South Wales, physiotherapists are required to be registered.&lt;ref name=coat&gt;{{cite web|title=COATNEWS No 4 December 2006|url=http://www.coat.gov.au/docs/NSWChapter/COATNEWS/COATNEWSNo4DECEMBER2006.pdf|accessdate=13 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719105539/http://www.coat.gov.au/docs/NSWChapter/COATNEWS/COATNEWSNo4DECEMBER2006.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boards, such as the Physiotherapists Board, are established to register those health professionals, as well as provide other support services to the public.  Tribunals are established to deal with allegations of misconduct and to determine whether a health professional should be suspended or de-registered. In New South Wales, the tribunal is unique, as it is a separate tribunal specially set up for this health speciality.&lt;ref name=coat/&gt; This is in contrast to other Australian States, such as Victoria, which have one super tribunal that deals with all health professionals.&lt;ref name=coat/&gt;

==Establishment==
The tribunal is established under section 100 of the Physiotherapists Act 2001 (NSW). The [[Governor of New South Wales]] may appoint an Australian lawyer to be the chairperson of the tribunal.&lt;ref name=s101&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa2001232/s101.html Physiotherapists Act 2001 (NSW)] Retrieved 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The governor may also appoint any number of Australian lawyers to be deputy chairpersons of the tribunal.&lt;ref name=s101/&gt; The appointment can be for up to seven years and the person can be re-appointed again for up to another seven years.&lt;ref name=s101/&gt;

The tribunal has jurisdiction to hear:
*a complaint about a physiotherapist referred by the Board;
*an appeal against a decision of the Board; or
*the prosecution of a complaint by the Board.&lt;ref name=s102&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa2001232/s102.html Section 102 Physiotherapists Act 2001 (NSW)] Retrieved 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

When either of these situations arises, the [[Physiotherapists Registration Board]] will inform the chairperson of the tribunal of the matter.&lt;ref name=s101/&gt; The Board will also appoint three persons to sit on the tribunal.&lt;ref name=s101/&gt; Two of the persons selected must be registered physiotherapists.&lt;ref name=s101/&gt; Generally the board will select persons who are peers of the relevant person. The other person on the tribunal must be a lay person (i.e. a person who is not a physiotherapist).&lt;ref name=s101/&gt; This latter person is selected from a panel established by the Minister for Health.  The chairperson may personally hear the matter or may instead delegate the hearing to a deputy chairperson.&lt;ref name=s101/&gt; The four persons together constitute the tribunal.

The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is protective and its purpose is to protect the public. The object is not punitive and the Tribunal is not there to punish the physiotherapist but is there to maintain proper standards in the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWPYT/2007/1.html|title=Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) V MARGIOTTA [2007] NSWPYT 1|date=31 August 2007|accessdate=8 October 2017}} at paragraph 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==At the hearing==
The members of the tribunal are required to conduct an inquiry to any complaint, matter, application or appeal referred to the tribunal. The chairperson or deputy chairperson must decide when the inquiry is to be heard and must give at least fourteen days' notice to the physiotherapist the subject of the inquiry. The chairperson must also give notice to any person who made the complaint, the Department of Health, the Health Care Complaints Commission, and the Physiotherapists Board.&lt;ref name=s111&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa2001232/s111.html Section 111, Physiotherapists Act 2001 (NSW)] Retrieved 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the person who made the complaint, and the physiotherapist concerned, are entitled to be legally represented if they so wish.&lt;ref name=s113&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa2001232/s113.html Section 113, Physiotherapists Act 2001 (NSW)] Retrieved 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Any inquiry is open to the public, so members of the public or the press are able to observe the proceedings.&lt;ref name=s112&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa2001232/s112.html s112, Physiotherapists Act 2001 (NSW)] Retrieved 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunal may conduct the inquiry in private if necessary.&lt;ref name=s112/&gt; The tribunal has a range of powers to suppress the publication of information given at the inquiry.&lt;ref name=Sch5/&gt; For example, the tribunal may prohibit the publication of the names of the witnesses, the complainant or the physiotherapist concerned.&lt;ref name=Sch5&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa2001232/.html Schedule 5, Physiotherapists Act 2001 (NSW) Retrieved 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Where a person or organisation breaches this requirement, the person or organisation may be prosecuted for a criminal offence.&lt;ref name=Sch5/&gt; The chairperson or deputy chairman decides all questions of law or matters of legal principle.&lt;ref name=s106/&gt; Their decision is final on the point. In matters of fact or evidence, three of the four members must agree. If the decision is split two-two, then the chairperson or deputy chairperson has the casting vote.&lt;ref name=s106&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa2001232/s106.html s106, Physiotherapists Act 2001 (NSW)] Retrieved 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the rules of evidence (which the limit the type of evidence which a court can recognise) do not need to be observed in the tribunal.&lt;ref name=Sch5/&gt; However, because of the serious nature of the proceedings, they are generally heard  with a high degree of formality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting to Know the Physiotherapists Act 2001|url=http://www.physioreg.health.nsw.gov.au/hprb/physio_web/pdf/physioactbrochure.pdf|accessdate=13 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829173413/http://www.physioreg.health.nsw.gov.au/hprb/physio_web/pdf/physioactbrochure.pdf|archivedate=29 August 2007|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses are called, and their testimony is given on oath in the same way that evidence is given in a court of law. The tribunal is empowered to issue summons to compel people to attend the tribunal to give evidence. The tribunal may also direct a written notice for a person or organisation to produce documentation.&lt;ref name=Sch5/&gt;

==Outcomes==
If the tribunal after an inquiry determines the matters proved against the physiotherapist, the tribunal has a number of options available to it. The tribunal may caution or only reprimand the person concerned. It may direct the person to seek medical or psychiatric treatment or counselling. It may order that the person complete an educational course. The tribunal may impose conditions on the continuing practice of the physiotherapist. In extreme cases, the tribunal may order the suspension or removal of the physiotherapist from practising.&lt;ref&gt;section 64&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunal is required to given written reasons of its decision within 30 days of the finalisation of the case.&lt;ref&gt;section 66&lt;/ref&gt; There is a right of appeal in certain circumstances to the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] against the decision of the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Section 79 and 80&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunal heard one appeal in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=155|title=13 Investigating Complaints|url=http://www.hccc.nsw.gov.au/downloads/AR0607part2.pdf|accessdate=6 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719010737/http://www.hccc.nsw.gov.au/downloads/AR0607part2.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical cases in the tribunal==
The decisions of the tribunal are available on the internet beginning with decisions made in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/austlii/recent.html Announcements page of Australasian Legal Information Institute] Retrieved 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the tribunal’s first decisions concerning a complaint against a physiotherapist who found to be guilty of “unsatisfactory professional conduct”.  The physiotherapist concerned had been convicted of making false claims for services under Workers Compensation laws in the [[Local Court of New South Wales]]. The physiotherapist was reprimanded and suspended for six months and ordered to have ongoing counselling.

'''Prevention through design''' (PtD), also called '''safety by design''' usually in Europe, is the concept of applying methods to minimize [[occupational safety and health|occupational hazards]] early in the design process, with an emphasis on optimizing employee health and safety throughout the [[Product lifecycle|life cycle]] of materials and processes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-147/|title=General Safe Practices for Working with Engineered Nanomaterials in Research Laboratories|last=|first=|date=May 2012|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a concept and movement that encourages [[Construction management|construction]] or [[product design]]ers to "design out" health and safety risks during design development. The concept supports the view that along with quality, programme and cost; safety is determined during the design stage.&lt;ref&gt;Behm M, 2005, Linking Construction Fatalities to the Design for Construction Safety Concept, Safety Science, Number 43, Pages 589-611&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Churcher D W, Alwani-Starr G M,Incorporating construction health and safety into the design process”, Implementation of Health and Safety in Construction Sites, Alvels, Dias &amp; Coble (eds), {{ISBN|90-5410-847-9}}, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ECI 2000 Designing for Safety and Health, Proceedings of the ECI/CIB/HSE international Conference, London, European Construction Institute, Loughborough, ed A G F Gibb, June 245pp ECI, Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gambatese JA,  Hinze J and Haas C, Tool to Design for Construction Worker Safety, Journal of Architectural Engineering, Volume 3, Part 1, Pages 32-42, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gambatese JA, 2003, Safety in design: A Proactive Approach to Construction Worker Safety and Health, Applied Occupational and Environmental Hygiene, Vol 18 (5): pp 339-342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gambatese JA, Hinze J, Addressing Construction Worker Safety in the Design Phase&amp;nbsp;– Designing for worker Safety, Automation in Construction, Volume 8, Issue 6, Pages 643-649, August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hecker S, Gambatese J, Weinstein M, Designing for Worker Safety- Moving the Construction Safety Process Upstream, Professional Safety, Pages 32-44, September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;   It increases the cost-effectiveness of enhancements to occupational safety and health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
Each year in the U.S., 55,000 people die from work-related injuries and diseases, 294,000 are made sick, and 3.8 million are injured. The annual direct and indirect costs have been estimated to range from $128 billion to $155 billion. Recent studies in [[Australia]] indicate that design is a significant contributor in 37% of work-related fatalities; therefore, the successful implementation of prevention through design concepts can have substantial impacts on worker health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;Heidel, Donna S., Paul Schulte.

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) in the United States is a major contributor and promoter of PtD policy and guidelines. NIOSH considers PtD to be "the most effective and reliable type" of prevention of [[Occupational injury|occupational injuries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/wp-solutions/2015-198/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Supporting Prevention through Design (PtD) Using Business Value Concepts (2015-198)|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A core tenet of PtD philosophy the concept of addressing workplace hazards using methods at the top of the [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|Hierarch of Controls]], namely elimination and substitution.

Within Europe, construction designers are legally bound to design out risks during design development to reduce [[Construction site safety#Hazards to construction workers|hazards]] in the construction and end use phases via the Mobile Worksite Directive (also known as CDM regulations in the UK). The concept supports this legal requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/construction/cdm/2015/index.htm|title=Construction Design and Management Regulations 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hse.gov.uk|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[Notified Body|Notified Bodies]] provide testing and design verification services to ensure [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] with the safety standards defined in [[regulation codes]] such as the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tuv.com/en/corporate/business_customers/plants_machinery_1/pressure_equipment_2/asme_1/asme.html|title=Pressure Vessel Inspection According to ASME|last=|first=|date=|website=TÜV Rheinland|language=de|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[non-governmental organization]]s have been established to support this aim, principally in the UK, Australia and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saferdesign.org/Pages/default.aspx|title=Expired Registration Recovery Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saferdesign.org|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415184534/http://www.saferdesign.org/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2013-04-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/swa/HealthSafety/SafeDesign/|title=Safe Work Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=Safe Work Australia|language=en-AU|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214053507/http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/swa/HealthSafety/SafeDesign/|archive-date=2009-12-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://secure.sph.harvard.edu/ccpe/programs.cfm?CSID=SDC0210&amp;pg=cluster&amp;CLID=1|title=Executive and Continuing Professional Education|last=|first=|date=|website=Harvard University School of Public Health|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816172545/https://secure.sph.harvard.edu/ccpe/programs.cfm?CSID%3DSDC0210%26pg%3Dcluster%26CLID%3D1|archive-date=2010-08-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While engineering as a rule factors human safety into the design process, a modern appraisal of specific links to design and workers' safety can be seen in efforts beginning in the 1800s.  Trends included the widespread implementation of guards for machinery, controls for [[elevator]]s, and [[boiler]] safety practices. This was followed by enhanced design for [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], enclosures, system monitors, [[Lockout-Tagout|lockout/tagout]] controls, and hearing protectors. More recently, there has been the development of chemical [[process safety]], [[ergonomics|ergonomically]] engineered tools, chairs, and work stations, lifting devices, retractable needles, latex-free gloves, and a parade of other safety devices and processes.&lt;ref name=schulte&gt;Schulte, Paul A., Richard Rinehart, Andrea Okun, Charles L. Geraci, Donna S. Heidel. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V6F-4S3G8HX-2/2/b4749f31e38e327949d99b974a9705f8 ''National Prevention through Design (PtD) Initiative''], ''Journal of Safety Research'', Volume 39, Issue 2. Prevention through Design, 2008, Pages 115-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety]] began its National Initiative on Prevention through Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-123/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - The State of the National Initiative on Prevention through Design (2014-123)|author=|date=|website=www.CDC.gov|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of promoting prevention through design philosophy, practice, and policy.

==Integration==
Prevention through design represents a shift in approach for on-the-job safety. It involves evaluating potential risks associated with processes, structures, equipment, and tools. It takes into consideration the construction, maintenance, decommissioning, and disposal or recycling of waste material.&lt;ref name=schulte /&gt;
 
The idea of redesigning job tasks and work environments has begun to gain momentum in business and government as a cost-effective means to enhance occupational safety and health. Many U.S. companies openly support PtD concepts and have developed management practices to implement them. Other countries are actively promoting PtD concepts as well. The [[United Kingdom]] began requiring construction companies, project owners, and architects to address safety and health during the design phase of projects in 1994. Australia developed the Australian National OHS Strategy 2002–2012, which set "eliminating hazards at the design stage" as one of five national priorities. As a result, the Australian Safety and Compensation Council (ASCC) developed the Safe Design National Strategy and Action Plans for Australia encompassing a wide range of design areas.&lt;ref name=niosh /&gt;

== In the US ==

=== Government ===
The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] is a large contributor to prevention through design efforts in the United States. Several NIOSH initiatives and guidelines directly or indirectly advocate for PtD practices. Through NIOSH efforts, the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] posted new PtD credits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ptd/greenjobs.html|title=CDC - Prevention Through Design: Green , Safe, and Healthy Jobs - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|author=|date=|website=www.CDC.gov|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; available for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification]] for construction.

'''Quantitative marketing research''' is the application of quantitative research techniques to the field of marketing. It has roots in both the [[positivism|positivist]] view of the world, and the modern marketing viewpoint that marketing is an interactive process in which both the buyer and seller reach a satisfying agreement on the "[[Marketing mix|four Ps]]" of marketing: Product, Price, Place (location) and Promotion.

As a [[social research]] method, it typically involves the construction of [[questionnaire]]s and [[scale (social sciences)|scales]]. People who respond (respondents) are asked to complete the [[statistical survey|survey]]. [[Marketing|Marketers]] use the information to obtain and understand the needs of individuals in the marketplace, and to create [[strategic planning|strategies]] and [[marketing plan]]s.

==Typical general procedure==
Simply put, there are five major and important steps involved in the research process:

#Defining the problem.
#[[Experimental design|Research design]].
#[[Data collection]].
#[[Data analysis]].
#[[Report writing]] &amp; presentation.

A brief discussion on these steps is:

# Problem audit and problem definition - What is the problem? What are the various aspects of the problem? What information is needed?
# Conceptualization and operationalization - How exactly do we define the concepts involved? How do we translate these concepts into observable and measurable behaviours?
# [[Hypothesis]] specification - What claim(s) do we want to test?
# Research design specification - What type of methodology to use? - examples: questionnaire, survey
# [[questionnaire construction|Question specification]] - What questions to ask? In what order?
# [[scale (social sciences)|Scale specification]] - How will preferences be rated?
# [[sampling (statistics)|Sampling design]] specification - What is the total population? What sample size is necessary for this population? What sampling method to use?- examples: '''Probability Sampling:-''' ([[cluster sampling]], [[stratified sampling]], [[simple random sampling]], [[multistage sampling]], [[systematic sampling]]) &amp; '''[[Nonprobability sampling]]:-''' (Convenience Sampling, Judgement Sampling, Purposive Sampling, Quota Sampling, Snowball Sampling, etc. )
# Data collection - Use mail, telephone, internet, mall intercepts
# Codification and re-specification - Make adjustments to the raw data so it is compatible with statistical techniques and with the objectives of the research - examples: assigning numbers, consistency checks, substitutions, deletions, weighting, dummy variables, scale transformations, scale standardization
# Statistical analysis - Perform various descriptive and inferential techniques (see below) on the raw data. Make inferences from the sample to the whole population. Test the results for statistical significance.
# Interpret and integrate findings - What do the results mean? What conclusions can be drawn? How do these findings relate to similar research?
# Write the research report - Report usually has headings such as: 1) executive summary; 2) objectives; 3) methodology; 4) main findings; 5) detailed charts and diagrams. Present the report to the client in a 10-minute presentation. Be prepared for questions.

The design step may involve a pilot study in order to discover any hidden issues. The codification and analysis steps are typically performed by computer, using [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]].  The data collection steps, can in some instances be automated, but often require significant manpower to undertake.  Interpretation is a skill mastered only by experience.

==Statistical analysis==

The data acquired for quantitative marketing research can be analysed by almost any of the range of techniques of [[statistical analysis]], which can be broadly divided into [[descriptive statistics]] and [[statistical inference]]. An important set of techniques is that related to [[statistical survey]]s. In any instance, an appropriate type of statistical analysis should take account of the various types of error that may arise, as outlined below.

===Reliability and validity===

Research should be tested for [[reliability (psychometric)|reliability]], generalizability, and [[validity (psychometric)|validity]].

'''Generalizability''' is the ability to make inferences from a sample to the population.

'''Reliability''' is the extent to which a measure will produce consistent results.
* ''Test-retest reliability'' checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated under similar circumstances. Stability over repeated measures is assessed with the Pearson coefficient.
* ''Alternative forms reliability'' checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated using different forms.
* ''Internal consistency reliability'' checks how well the individual measures included in the research are converted into a composite measure. Internal consistency may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test (split-half reliability). The value of the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] is adjusted with the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula]] to correspond to the correlation between two full-length tests. A commonly used measure is [[Cronbach's alpha|Cronbach's α]], which is equivalent to the mean of all possible split-half coefficients. Reliability may be improved by increasing the sample size.

'''Validity''' asks whether the research measured what it intended to.
* ''Content validation'' (also called face validity) checks how well the content of the research are related to the variables to be studied; it seeks to answer whether the research questions are representative of the variables being researched. It is a demonstration that the items of a test are drawn from the domain being measured.
* ''Criterion validation'' checks how meaningful the research criteria are relative to other possible criteria. When the criterion is collected later the goal is to establish predictive validity.
* ''Construct validation'' checks what underlying construct is being measured. There are three variants of construct validity: ''convergent validity'' (how well the research relates to other measures of the same construct), ''discriminant validity'' (how poorly the research relates to measures of opposing constructs), and ''nomological validity'' (how well the research relates to other variables as required by theory).
* ''Internal validation'', used primarily in experimental research designs, checks the relation between the dependent and independent variables (i.e. Did the experimental manipulation of the independent variable actually cause the observed results?)
* ''External validation'' checks whether the experimental results can be generalized.

Validity implies reliability: A valid measure must be reliable. Reliability does not necessarily imply validity, however: A reliable measure does not imply that it is valid.

===Types of errors===

'''Random sampling errors:'''
*sample too small
*sample not representative
*inappropriate sampling method used
*[[errors and residuals in statistics|random errors]]
'''Research design errors:'''
*bias introduced
*measurement error
*data analysis error
*sampling frame error
*population definition error
*scaling error
*question construction error
'''Interviewer errors:'''
*recording errors
*cheating errors
*questioning errors
*respondent selection error
'''Respondent errors:'''
*non-response error
*inability error
*falsification error
'''Hypothesis errors:'''
*[[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|type I error]] (also called alpha error)
**the study results lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis even though it is actually true
*[[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|type II error]] (also called beta error)
**the study results lead to the acceptance (non-rejection) of the null hypothesis even though it is actually false

'''Radiation dose reconstruction''' refers to the process of estimating [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] doses that were received by individuals or populations in the past as a result of particular exposure situations of concern.&lt;ref name=dtra&gt;''A Review of the Dose Reconstruction Program of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency''. The National Academies Press, 2003, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle of radiation dose reconstruction is to characterize the radiation environment to which individuals have been exposed using available information. In cases where radiation exposures can not be fully characterized based on available data, default values based on reasonable scientific assumptions can be used as substitutes.  The extent to which the default values are used depends on the purpose of the reconstruction(s) being undertaken.

==Background==
The methods and techniques used in dose reconstructions have been growing and evolving rapidly. It wasn’t until the late 1970s that dose reconstruction emerged as a scientific discipline&lt;ref name=DRVid&gt;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/ocasdose.html#drvideo Dose Reconstruction Program Video]&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been used in practice in the United States for the last two decades.&lt;ref name=dtra2&gt;A Review of the Dose Reconstruction Program of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, The National Academies Press, 2003, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific methods and practices used to complete dose reconstructions are often based on the standards published by international consensus organizations such as the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]].&lt;ref name=DRVid /&gt; 

When conducted properly, dose reconstruction is a scientifically valid process for estimating radiation dose received by an individual or group of individuals.  It is commonly used in occupational epidemiological studies to determine the amount of radiation workers may have received as part of their employment.  For these types of studies, dose reconstruction is similar to the process of estimating how much radiation current workers receive, for example at a nuclear facility, except dose reconstructions evaluate past exposures. The terms historical and retrospective often are used to describe a dose reconstruction.&lt;ref name=dtra2 /&gt;  Dose estimation is the term sometimes used to describe the process used to determine radiation exposures to current populations or individuals.     

Dose reconstruction methods have also commonly been applied in environmental settings to assess [[radionuclide]] releases into the environment from nuclear sites.  One such environmentally focused study was published in 1983 by the [[U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] entitled Radiological Risk Assessment:  A Textbook on Environmental Dose Analysis.  This book was updated with major revisions in 2008 and it details the steps of radiological assessments, which uses similar methods and techniques as a dose reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Till, John and Grogan, Helen, eds; Radiological Risk Assessment and Environmental Analysis, Oxford University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Dose reconstruction methods are not limited to just measuring exposures to radiation.  Dose reconstruction principles can be used to reconstruct exposures to other hazardous materials and to determine the health effects of those toxins to populations or individuals.

==Radiation dose reconstruction elements==

The dose reconstruction process has several basic elements, which have been identified as follows:
* Definition of exposure scenarios,
* Identification of exposure pathways,
* Development and implementation of methods of estimating dose,
* Evaluation of uncertainties in estimates of dose,
* Presentation and interpretation of results,
* Quality assurance and quality control.

==Research and applications==
Radiation dose reconstruction methods are used to a large extent in occupational, environmental, and medical epidemiological research studies.  
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) has been involved in several dose reconstruction projects.          

Several CDC agencies are involved in dose reconstruction projects:  the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR), the [[National Center for Environmental Health]] (NCEH), and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH).

===Superfund sites===
The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) conducts dose reconstructions in relation to work done at [[Superfund sites]].  ATSDR defines exposure-dose reconstruction as an approach that uses computational models and other approximation techniques to estimate cumulative amounts of hazardous substances internalized by individuals presumed to be or who are actually at risk from contact with substances associated with hazardous waste sites.

===Exposure-dose reconstruction program===
In March 1993, ATSDR established the Exposure-Dose Reconstruction Program (EDRP).  EDRP represents a coordinated, comprehensive effort to develop sensitive, integrated, science-based methods for improving health scientists’ and assessors’ access to current and historical exposure-dose characterization.  EDRP was created to confront the challenge that faced health scientists and assessors who have not always had access to information-especially historical information regarding an individual’s direct measure of exposure to and dose of chemicals associated with hazardous waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/edrp/ Exposure-Dose Reconstruction Program (EDRP)] Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Accessed September 04, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epidemiological health studies===
The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) coordinates program and conducts environmental epidemiological health studies using dose reconstruction principles. NCEH has undertaken a series of studies to assess the possible health consequences of off-site emissions of radioactive materials from DOE-managed nuclear facilities in the United States.&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;National Research Council (U.S.), Committee on an Assessment of CDC Radiation Studies, Radiation Dose Reconstruction for Epidemiologic Uses, National Academy Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Dose reconstruction as used by NCEH is defined as the process of estimating doses to the public from past releases to the environment of radionuclides or chemicals. These doses form the basis for estimating health risks.  Past exposures are the focus of the NCEH studies.&lt;ref name=NRC /&gt;

===Occupational energy research===
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) completes dose reconstructions as a component of ongoing worker health studies. The NIOSH Occupational Energy Research Program’s mission is to conduct relevant, unbiased research to identify and quantify health effects among workers exposed to ionizing radiation and other agents; to develop and refine exposure assessment methods; to effectively communicate study results to workers, scientists, and the public; to contribute scientific information for the prevention of occupational injury and illness; and to adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and concern for workers’ health, safety and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/oerp/ Occupational Energy Research Program] NIOSH. Accessed September 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program of 2000===
One of the largest mass applications of individual dose reconstruction principles is also being undertaken by NIOSH.  NIOSH is the designated agency responsible for completing radiation dose reconstructions for individuals under the [[Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program| Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program of 2000]] (the Act).  Under the Act, individuals, and in some cases their survivors, are eligible for compensation for specified illnesses they received from occupational exposures to beryllium, asbestos, toxic materials, and radiation if they worked at a covered [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) facility or a facility that contracted with DOE to produce nuclear weapons or components, known as Atomic Weapons Employers (AWE).  The program is administered by the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]].  NIOSH’s responsibility under the Act is to determine the probability that an individual’s cancer was a result of their occupational radiation exposure at a DOE or AWE facility.  This probability is determined by DOL and is based on the radiation dose reconstruction completed by NIOSH.  The dose reconstructions are completed by individuals trained in the field of [[health physics]].  

The science behind the NIOSH dose reconstruction process has been published in the peer-reviewed professional journal Health Physics: The Radiation Safety Journal in July 2008. This edition of the Journal was dedicated entirely to the NIOSH Radiation Dose Reconstruction Program.

===Nuclear Test Personnel Review===
The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] uses dose reconstructions to process claims under the Nuclear Test Personnel Review (NTPR) program.  The NTPR is a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] program that works to confirm veteran participation in U.S. atmospheric nuclear tests from 1945 to 1962, and the occupation forces of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.  If the veteran is a confirmed participant of these events, NTPR may provide either an actual or estimated radiation dose received by the veteran.  The [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] completes the dose reconstructions for the NTPR program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5032">A '''reference price''' (RP) is the price that a purchaser announces that it is willing to pay for a good or service. It is used by high-volume purchasers to inform suppliers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/upshot/how-common-procedures-got-20-percent-cheaper-for-many-californians.html|title=How Common Procedures Became 20 Percent Cheaper for Many Californians|last=Frakt|first=Austin|date=2016-08-08|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RP requires consumers to have access to price and quality information, which is not general practice in many industries. Further, it does not help consumers with urgent needs, cognitive and/or other impairments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Reference pricing requires sufficient competition. Otherwise, consumers have no choice about providers, who in turn face less pricing pressure. Reference pricing could encourage lower quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
{{toclimit|3}}

== Applications ==

=== Health care ===
Some insurers use reference pricing to reduce their provider costs. The insurer announces prices that it is willing to pay for specific surgical procedures, pharmaceuticals and other services. If the provider charges a higher price, the patient is responsible for the balance. One study estimated&amp;nbsp;that about 40 percent of health care spending is for services for which patients could shop.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Appropriate services include hip and knee replacement, colonoscopy, [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of the spine, [[CT scan|computerized tomography]] (CT) scan of the head or brain, [[Cardiac stress test|nuclear stress test]] of the heart, and [[echocardiogram]] because they have relatively uniform protocols and are less likely to experience variation in quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebri.org/pdf/briefspdf/ebri_ib_398_apr14.refprcng.pdf|title=Reference Pricing for Health Care Services: A New Twist on the Defined Contribution Concept in Employment-Based Health Benefits|last=Fronstin|first=Paul|date=April 2014|website=ebri.org|publisher=Employee Benefits Research Institute|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In health care, a more common alternative is to limit patients to a specific network of providers who have accepted the pricing and other terms specified by the insurer. RP provides consumers a broader choice of providers. Further, some large employers contract with regional "centers of excellence," such as [[Cleveland Clinic]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On May 2, 2014, the Obama administration published its approval for large/self-insured firms to use RP for health care services and to use the price of generic drugs as the RP for other drugs, which would encourage patients to favor generics over non-generics. Costs that exceed the RP are not counted for ACA's out-of-pocket limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://khn.org/news/what-you-should-know-about-reference-pricing/|title=7 Things You Should Know About The Next Big Benefit Change|last=|first=|date=2014-05-28|website=|publisher=Kaiser Health News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CalPERS ====
In 2011 [[California Public Employees' Retirement System]]&amp;nbsp;(CalPERS) adopted reference pricing for 450,000 members. The approach was used for [[Knee replacement|knee]] and [[Hip replacement|hip replacement surgery]],&amp;nbsp;[[arthroscopy]], [[Colonoscopy|colonoscopies]], [[Cataract surgery|cataract removal&amp;nbsp;surgery]] and other elective procedures. For example, the RP for a&amp;nbsp;knee or hip replacement surgery&amp;nbsp;was $30,000. As before, the patient was responsible for 20 percent of the first $15,000, paying a maximum of $3,000. The insurer covered the next $15,000. However, if the procedure cost $40,000, the patient was responsible for the final $10,000. Initially 41 of the hundreds of hospitals provided knee and hip replacement procedures at or below the RP with acceptable quality. Some hospitals charged more than $100,000. Multiple studies found that patients sought out the lower cost facilities. Prices for knee and hip replacements and cataract surgery fell by an average 20%. Other procedures fell by similar percentages. Many higher price facilities lowered their prices. Quality was apparently unaffected. By contrast, prices paid by employer-sponsored plans&amp;nbsp;rose by about 5.5 percent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

CalPERS reduced cost-sharing for patients who chose a (lower cost) outpatient surgical center, instead of a (higher cost) hospital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Energy ===
The Canadian province of [[Alberta]] operates an RP scheme for [[natural gas]]. It is a monthly, weighted average of the consumer price in Alberta and a price at the Alberta border, with transporting and marketing adjustments. The system became effective in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/NaturalGas/1324.asp|title=Alberta Price History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Government of Alberta|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rostokino Aqueduct (1).jpg|thumb|300px|Rostokino Aqueduct]]

'''Rostokino Aqueduct''', also known as '''Millionny Bridge''', is a stone [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] over [[Yauza]] river in [[Rostokino District]] of [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], built in 1780-1804. It is the only remaining aqueduct in Moscow, once a part of [[Mytishchi]] Water Supply, Moscow's first centralized water utility.

==History==
The aqueduct was commissioned by [[Catherine II of Russia]] to engineer Friedrich Wilhelm Bauer. Catherine authorized 1.1 million rouble expenditure and 400 soldiers.&lt;ref name="MWM"&gt;Moscow Water Museum data, [http://testan.narod.ru/museum/voda.htm Water Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Builders used second-hand stone left by demolition of [[Bely Gorod]] fortifications. Construction, frequently interrupted, dragged for 25 years, as the soldier engineers were summoned to the  [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)|war with Turkey (1787-1792)]] and various other jobs. In the process, both Catherine and Bauer died. Colonel Ivan Gerard lead the project after Bauer's death in 1783. Catherine's son, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], had to issue 400,000 roubles financing; [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] added 200,000 roubles. Finally, the aqueduct was completed at an unprecedented cost of 2 million roubles,&lt;ref&gt;Moscow Water Museum figure. Other sources put it at 1.60 and 1.648 million roubles&lt;/ref&gt; thus the name ''Millionny Bridge''.

==Specifications==
The total length is {{convert|356|m}}, the height over Yauza river level is {{convert|19|m}}. There are 21 arches, each spans {{convert|8.5|m}}. Original masonry water canal {{convert|0.9|m}} wide and {{convert|1.2|m}} high&lt;ref&gt;Russian: Энциклопедия "Москва", 2004 (''Moscow Encyclopedia'', 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; was replaced with iron pipe in the 1850s.

Water flowed naturally through a 20-kilometre masonry canal to a system of fountain taps; in 1892, the system was uprated with construction of pumps and water reservoires in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Russian: История одного водопровода, "Энергия промышленного роста"  N 6[7] June 2006 [http://www.epr-magazine.ru/industrial_history/landscape/vodoprovod/ www.epr-magazine.ru]&lt;/ref&gt; Mytishchi Water Supply was closed in 1937, when a superior water supply, a part of [[Moscow Canal]] project, was completed.

==Ichka Aqueduct (demolished)==
A smaller, single-span aqueduct over [[Ichka]] river was built during the 1888-1892 modernization of Mytishchi system. It was destroyed in 1997 to make way for [[MKAD]] highway.&lt;ref&gt;Russian: [http://www.archi-tec.ru/news/6/ www.archi-tec.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Royal College of Surgeons''' or '''Royal Surgical College''' is a type of organisation found in many present and former members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. These organisations are responsible for training surgeons and setting their examinations. In this context, the term chartered implies the awarding of a [[Royal charter]].

==History==
The origins of the first Royal College of Surgeons go back to the fourteenth century with the foundation of the Guild of Surgeons Within the City of London.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Kuo Tai Fu (2000)The origins of surgery. 2: From barbers to surgeons Annals of the College of Surgeons Hong Kong 4 (1), 35–49. {{doi|10.1046/j.1442-2034.2000.00029.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was dispute between the surgeons and [[barber surgeon]]s until an agreement was signed between them in 1493, giving the fellowship of surgeons the power of incorporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2003.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016075407/http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2003.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-16 |df= }}, page 118&lt;/ref&gt; The Guild of Barbers of Dublin received a Royal Charter of Henry Vi in 1446, making it the earliest Royal Medical incorporation in Britain or Ireland. This was followed in 1505 by the incorporation of the Barber Surgeons of Edinburgh as a [[Craft Guild]] of [[Edinburgh]]. This body was granted a [[royal charter]] in 1506 by [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV]] of [[Scotland]]. It was followed by the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]], royally chartered by [[James VI]] in 1599, as the Glasgow Faculty.

The union in London was formalised further in 1540 by [[Henry VIII of England]] between the [[Worshipful Company of Barbers]] (incorporated 1462) and the Guild of Surgeons to form the Company of Barber-Surgeons. In 1745 the surgeons broke away from the [[barber]]s to form the Company of Surgeons. In 1800 the Company was granted a Royal Charter to become the Royal College of Surgeons in London. A further charter in 1843 granted it the present title of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. In 2010, [[Eilis McGovern|Prof. Eilis McGovern]] became President of the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] and thereby the first female President of any surgical Royal College in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/7800861/Irish-doctor-becomes-first-female-president-of-Royal-College-of-Surgeons-in-Ireland.html|title=Irish doctor becomes first female president of Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland|author=|date=3 June 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/medicine/ourcommunity/ouralumni/alumniprofilesinterviews/profeilismcgovern/|title=Prof Eilis McGovern|author=|date=|website=UCD School of Medicine &amp; Medical Science|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sleep Deprivation and Type 2 Diabetes==

Baseline levels of insulin do not signal muscle and fat cells to absorb glucose. When glucose levels are elevated, the pancreas responds by releasing insulin. Blood sugar will then rapidly drop. This can progress to [[type 2 diabetes]].

Sleep loss can affect the basic metabolic functions of storing [[carbohydrates]] and regulating [[hormones]]. Reduction of sleep from eight hours to four hours produces changes in [[glucose tolerance]] and [[endocrine system|endocrine function]]. Researchers from the University of Chicago Medical Center followed 11 healthy young men for 16 consecutive nights. The first 3 nights, the young men slept for the normal 8 hours. The next 6 nights, they slept for 4 hours. The next 7 nights, they spent 12 hours in bed. They all had the same diet. They found that there were changes in [[glucose metabolism]] that resemble that of [[type 2 diabetes]] patients. When the participants were tested after sleep deprivation, they took 40% longer than normal to regulate [[blood sugar]] levels after a high-[[carbohydrate]] meals. The secretion of insulin and the body's response to insulin decrease by 30%. [[Sleep deprivation]] also alters the productions of [[hormones]], lowering the secretion of [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] and increasing blood levels of [[cortisol]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|title=Lack of Deep Sleep May Increase Risk of Type 2 Diabetes|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080101093903.htm|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

It has also been shown that when slow-wave sleep was suppressed for three nights, young healthy subjects were 25% less sensitive to insulin. They needed more insulin to get rid of the same amount of glucose. If the body does not release more insulin to compensate, the blood-glucose levels will increase. This resembles impaired glucose tolerance, which can result in type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

==Lack of Sleep Related to Weight Gain==

Lack of sleep has been strongly associated with weight gain in a variety of studies&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schraer|first1=Rachel|last2=D'Urso|first2=Joey|title=10 charts that show why sleep is so important|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-41666563|website=BBC News|accessdate=28 October 2017|date=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; across all ages, though research suggests children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Connor|first1=Anahad|title=How Sleep Loss Adds to Weight Gain|url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/how-sleep-loss-adds-to-weight-gain/|website=Well|accessdate=28 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="debt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bayon|first1=Virginie|last2=Leger|first2=Damien|last3=Gomez-Merino|first3=Danielle|last4=Vecchierini|first4=Marie-Françoise|last5=Chennaoui|first5=Mounir|title=Sleep debt and obesity|journal=Annals of Medicine|date=11 July 2014|volume=46|issue=5|pages=264–272|doi=10.3109/07853890.2014.931103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleep deprivation is believed to influence the brain's response to high-calorie food, making it more attractive, while also affecting the production of hormones that control appetite.

Matthew P Walker, a psychology and neuroscience professor at UC Berkley, published a study during which the participants were deprived of sleep for one night. The New York Times summarized his study as such, "On days when the subjects had not had proper sleep, fattening foods like potato chips and sweets stimulated stronger responses in a part of the brain that helps govern the motivation to eat. But at the same time, the subjects experienced a sharp reduction in activity in the frontal cortex, a higher level part of the brain where consequences are weighted and rational decisions are made.”&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; A brain that has been deprived of sleep for one night is more likely to respond more intensely to junk food but also has the decreased ability to curb that desire. These results were consistent even as the subjects were given extra calories to compensate for the amount of energy expended during those extra hours that the subjects stayed awake, which indicates that one’s craving for junk food is not a response to offset an energy deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greer|first1=Stephanie M.|last2=Goldstein|first2=Andrea N.|last3=Walker|first3=Matthew P.|title=The impact of sleep deprivation on food desire in the human brain|journal=Nature Communications|date=6 August 2013|volume=4|doi=10.1038/ncomms3259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker further speculates that one of the biological basis for this reaction could the buildup of [[adenosine]], a metabolic byproduct that may degrade communication between networks in the brain. Adenosine is cleared from the brain during sleep.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Previous research by the University of Chicago had also associated short sleep with an increase in calorie consumption from snacks, albeit with no change in overall calorie intake, hormone levels or energy expenditure across the different sleep schedules tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nedeltcheva|first1=A.

D|title=Sleep curtailment is accompanied by increased intake of calories from snacks|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=3 December 2008|volume=89|issue=1|pages=126–133|doi=10.3945/ajcn.2008.26574|pmc=2615460}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review of studies on the link between sleep debt and obesity also reported no association between short sleep duration and total energy expenditure.&lt;ref name="debt"/&gt;

Another explanation of the relationship stems from the balance between two hormones, [[leptin]] and [[ghrelin]], which act on the nuclei of the hypothalamus to monitor energy and food intake. Leptin primarily inhibits appetite while ghrelin, which is the released by the stomach, works to stimulate appetite. Sleep deprivation has been associated with increased levels of ghrelin and decreased levels of leptin in multiple studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=Sunil|last2=Kavuru|first2=Mani|title=Sleep and Metabolism: An Overview|journal=International Journal of Endocrinology|date=2010|volume=2010|pages=1–12|doi=10.1155/2010/270832}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the hormonal variation, other research has also associated shortened sleep durations with a proportional increase in subjects' BMIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taheri|first1=Shahrad|last2=Lin|first2=Ling|last3=Austin|first3=Diane|last4=Young|first4=Terry|last5=Mignot|first5=Emmanuel|last6=Froguel|first6=Philippe|title=Short Sleep Duration Is Associated with Reduced Leptin, Elevated Ghrelin, and Increased Body Mass Index|journal=PLoS Medicine|date=7 December 2004|volume=1|issue=3|pages=e62|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0010062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metabolism'''

[[Metabolism]] involves two [[biochemical]] processes that occur in living organisms. The first is [[anabolism]], which refers to the buildup of molecules. The second is [[catabolism]], the breakdown of molecules. These two processes work to regulate the amount of energy the body uses to maintain itself. During non-REM sleep, [[metabolic rate]] and brain temperature are lowered to deal with damages that may have occurred during time of wakefulness.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Matthew (October 10, 2011). "Sleep Deprivation I: Immune Function and Metabolism".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sleep]] is important in regulating [[metabolism]]. Mammalian sleep can be sub-divided into two distinct phases - [[REM sleep|REM]] (rapid eye movement) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. In humans, NREM sleep has four stages, where the third and fourth stages are considered [[slow-wave sleep]] (SWS). SWS is considered deep sleep, when metabolism is least active.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Sunil; Kavuru, Mani (2 August 2010). "Sleep and Metabolism: Overview". International Journal of Endocrinology. Retrieved November 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
In normal metabolic function, the [[pancreas]] releases insulin after blood glucose levels raise. Insulin signals [[muscle cells|muscle]] and [[fat cells]] to absorb glucose from food. As a result, [[blood glucose]] levels return to normal.

Sleep loss can affect the basic metabolic functions of storing carbohydrates and regulating hormones. Reduction of sleep from eight hours to four hours produces changes in glucose tolerance and endocrine function. Researchers from the University of Chicago Medical Center followed 11 healthy young men for 16 consecutive nights. The first 3 nights, the young men slept for the normal 8 hours. The next 6 nights, they slept for 4 hours. The next 7 nights, they spent 12 hours in bed. They all had the same diet. They found that there were changes in glucose metabolism that resemble that of type 2 diabetes patients. When the participants were tested after sleep deprivation, they took 40% longer than normal to regulate blood sugar levels after a high-carbohydrate meals. The secretion of insulin and the body's response to insulin decrease by 30%. Sleep deprivation also alters the productions of hormones, lowering the secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone and increasing blood levels of cortisol.&lt;ref&gt;"Lack of Deep Sleep May Increase Risk of Type 2 Diabetes". Science Daily. Retrieved November 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

==Can Sleeping More promote Weight Loss?==

A regular sleep schedule can be a vital piece to increasing weight loss. While it is important to [[sleep]] more than an average of 6.5 hours per night, sleeping over 8.5 hours per night has been shown to contribute negatively to weight loss. Getting adequate sleep can also help account for any excess snacking that occurs throughout the course of the day due to feeling lethargic.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/melaniehaiken/2013/11/21/easiest-weight-loss-tip-ever-change-your-sleep-schedule/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a recent study at [[Brigham Young University]], a regular sleep schedule can make an almost immediate difference on the body’s ability to metabolize fat cells. In this specific study design, 300 college aged women (19–26 years old) were followed for a week and given an activity tracker which not only monitored movements, but also sleep patterns. The study also found that participants with lower [[Body mass index|BMI]] had higher quality of sleep, while those with higher BMI’s had lower quality of sleep. But was the reverse relationship also true?

While health professionals almost unanimously agree that if an individual is already getting 8 hours of sleep, then another half hour won’t make them lose weight; however, in cases where a person is used to getting 5 hours of sleep per night and they start getting 7–8 hours, it is common to see them start to shed pounds, especially in obese individuals. What causes this phenomenon? Two [[hormones]], [[ghrelin]] and [[leptin]], closely associated with appetite are key in the sleep and weight relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Sawamoto, R. "Higher Sleep Fragmentation Predicts a Lower Magnitude of Weight Loss in Overweight and Obese Women Participating in a Weight-loss Intervention." Nutrition and Diabetes 144 (2014): 1-6. PubMed. Web. 17 Nov. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghrelin]] is the hormone that controls appetite and tells the body when to eat, and when one is sleep-deprived, they have more ghrelin. Leptin on the other hand, is the hormone that tells one to stop eating, and when an individuals is sleep deprived, they have less leptin. In order to keep these hormone levels in balance, a person needs to get adequate sleep so they do not feel the need to excessively eat in an effort to gain [[energy]] and reduce [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].

==Effect of Oversleeping==

There have been many connections made between oversleeping and certain disorders. Many of these have been made without any identifiable reason for correlation, and are mainly [[observational]]. [[WebMD]] reports that [[sleep apnea]] may cause oversleeping because of disruptions in the normal [[sleep cycle]], that individuals who sleep more may be more prone to [[headaches]] because of [[neurotransmitters]] imbalances, back pain can increase with oversleeping because a certain level of physical activity is not being maintained, and that oversleeping may be correlated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and higher death rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/physical-side-effects-oversleeping "Oversleeping Side Effects: Is Too Much Sleep Harmful?"] WebMD. 22 Nov. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these connections have not been subject to rigorous examination. On the other hand, there have been studies that have looked into the potential physical side effects of oversleeping on weight and weight – related conditions. One study at [[Université Laval's Faculty of Medicine]] in Quebec studied the life habits of 276 subjects over a 6-year period and found that about 20% of those with long (9+ hours) of sleeping time developed type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance as compared to 7% in those that slept an average amount of time.&lt;ref name="Chaput, Jean-Philippe Chaput 2009"&gt;Chaput, Jean-Philippe Chaput. "Sleep Duration as a Risk Factor for the Development of Type 2 Diabetes or Impaired Glucose Tolerance: Analyses of the Quebec Family Study." Sleep Medicine 10.8 (2009): 919-24. PubMed. 20 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
A further look into the 6-year Quebec Family Study demonstrates that long-duration sleepers (9–10 hours) were 25% more likely to experience a 5-kg weight gain, and a 21% increase in risk of obesity, when adjusted for age, sex, and baseline BMI, as compared to average duration sleepers (7–8 hours) (NCBI). Even when the researchers adjusted for energy expenditure and physical activity levels (among other covariates), these relationships remained significant. The researcher’s results indicate a U-shaped relationship between hours of sleep and type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and weight, but the metabolic mechanisms affected by long sleep duration are less clear than with sleep restriction and remain somewhat speculative.&lt;ref name="Chaput, Jean-Philippe Chaput 2009"/&gt;

A Nurses’ Health Study analyzed a group of about 72,000 US women who did not report having coronary heart disease at the onset of the study, and assessed the relationship between their reported sleep durations and incidence of a CHD event over a period of 10 years (JAMA). At the conclusion of the study, the data indicated that women who slept a longer duration (9–11 hours) were 38% more likely to have CHD than women who slept 8 hours. However, the researchers had no plausible explanation for a cause-and-effect relationship &lt;ref&gt;Ayas, Najib T. "A Prospective Study of Sleep Duration and Coronary Heart Disease in Women." Arch Intern Medicine (2003): 205-09. PubMed. Web. 16 Nov. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obesity Related Sleep Disorders==

'''Sleep apnea'''
[[File:Obstruction ventilation apnée sommeil.svg|thumb|Obstructive Sleep Apnea]]
[[Sleep apnea]] is a sleep disorder which causes an individual to have short pauses in breathing or very shallow breaths while sleeping. These pauses in breathing can often cause the individual to wake up, snore, choke, or just generally disrupt their sleep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-disorders-problems "Obesity and Sleep."] Sleep Foundation. Accessed 22 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, sufferers of the disease do not get quality sleep during the night and are tired during the daytime. Sleep apnea is very difficult to diagnose because doctors can’t exactly tell if a person has [[sleep apnea]] in a regular routine visit. Additionally the patient himself may not even realize he has [[sleep apnea]] because it occurs during sleep, so a partner or roommate is usually the first to notice symptoms. 
There are two types of sleep apnea, obstructive and central. Obstructive sleep apnea is more common among overweight patients, and occurs when the airway is fully or partially blocked at times during sleep. Any air that does sneak by the blocked passage can cause loud snoring. The second type of sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, is much more rare and has to do with the part of the [[brain]] that regulates breathing. The signal from the brain to the [[lungs]] is disrupted, resulting in pauses in breathing. 
Treating obstructive sleep apnea is much easier than central sleep apnea, and the treatment plan may include things such as lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sleepapnea/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sleep in the Media ==

As obesity has become an issue of nationwide focus, all forms of media have begun to explore and report on the link between sleep and weight. The coverage spans from articles in Women’s Health Magazine on “6 Ways Sleep Can Help you Lose Weight,” to NPR’s story on the research linking a lack of sleep to obesity, to Harvard School of Public Health’s discussion of sleep as an “obesity prevention source” on their site.&lt;ref&gt;Merz, Julia. [https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19924272/sleep-weight-loss/ “6 Ways Sleep Can Help You Lose Weight”] Women’s Health 18 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NeighMond, Patti. Report Links Lack of Sleep and Obesity. NPR. 7 Dec. 2004. Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-causes/sleep-and-obesity/ “Sleep”] Obesity Prevention Source. Harvard School of Public Health, 2014. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; No matter how diverse the range of broadcasting, media sources seem to agree that, for whatever reasons, sleep is an important part of maintaining a healthy weight, and could be an effective approach to the obesity epidemic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10062">The '''Social Support Questionnaire''' (SSQ) is a quantitative, psychometrically sound survey questionnaire intended to measure social support and satisfaction with said social support from the perspective of the interviewee.&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fetzer.org/sites/default/files/images/stories/pdf/selfmeasures/Self_Measures_for_Love_and_Compassion_Research_SOCIAL_SUPPORT.pdf|title=Social Support Questionnaire|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407587044007|title=A Brief Measure of Social Support: Practical and Theoretical Implications|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1177/0265407587044007|volume=4|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|pages=497–510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degree of [[social support]] has been shown to influence the onset and course of certain psychiatric disorders such as [[clinical depression]] or [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.institute-of-mental-health.jp/thesis/pdf/thesis-04/thesis-04-32.pdf|title=Social Support Questionnaire among psychiatric patients with various diagnoses and normal controls|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SSQ was approved for public release in 1981 by Irwin Sarason, Henry Levine, Robert Basham and Barbara Sarason under the University of Washington Department of Psychology and consists of 27 questions.&lt;ref name="ADA100464"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA100464|title=ADA100464|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the SSQ has good test-retest reliability and convergent internal construct validity.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ADA100464" /&gt;

==Overview==
The questionnaire is designed so that each question has a two-part answer. The first part asks the interviewee to list up to nine people available to provide support that meet the criteria stated in the question. These support individuals are specified using their initials in addition to the relationship to the interviewee.&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://instruct.uwo.ca/kinesiology/9641/Assessments/Social/SSQ.html|title=BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly - Assessment Summary Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Example questions from the first part includes questions such as “Whom could you count on to help if you had just been fired from your job or expelled from school?” and “Whom do you feel would help if a family member very close to you died?”.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

The second part asks the interviewee to specify how satisfied they are with each of the people stated in the first part. The SSQ respondents use a 6 -point [[Likert scale]] to indicate their degree of satisfaction with the support from the above people ranging from “1 - very dissatisfied” to “6 - very satisfied”.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

The Social Support Questionnaire has multiple short forms such as the SSQ3 and the SSQ6.

==History of the SSQ==
The SSQ is based on 4 original studies. The first study set out to determine whether the SSQ had the desired psychometric properties. The second study tried to relate SSQ and a diversity of personality measures such as [[anxiety]], depression and hostility in connection with the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist. The third study considered the relationship between social support, the prior year’s negative and positive life events, internal-external locus of control and self- esteem in conjunction with the Life Experiences Survey. The fourth study tested the idea that social support could serve as a buffer when faced with difficult life situations via trying to solve a maze and subsequently completing the Cognitive Interference Questionnaire.&lt;ref name="ADA100464" /&gt;

==Scoring==
The overall support score (SSQN) is calculated by taking an average of the individual scores across the 27 items.&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly" /&gt; A high score on the SSQ indicates more optimism about life than a low score. Respondents with low SSQ scores have a higher prevalence of negative life events and illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarason|first=|year=1985|title=Concomitants of Social Support: Social Skills, Physical Attractiveness and Gender|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA141884|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=49|pages=469–480|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.49.2.469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scoring is as follows:

1. Add the total number of people for all 27 items (questions). (Max. is 243). Divide by 27 for average item score. This gives you SSQ Number Score, or SSQN.

2. Add the total satisfaction scores for all 27 items (questions). (Max is 162). Divide by 27 for average item score. This gives you SSQ Satisfaction score or SSQS.

3. Finally, you can average the above for  the total number of people that are family members - this results in the SSQ family score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agedcaretests.com/The_Social_Support_Questionnaire_(SSQ)_SAMPLE.pdf|title=Social Support Questionnaire Sample|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability==
According to Sarason, the SSQ takes between fifteen to eighteen minutes to properly administer and has “good” test-retest reliability.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

==Validity==
The SSQ was compared with the depression scale and validity tests show significant negative correlation ranging from -0.22 to -0.43. The SSQ and the optimism scale have a correlation of 0.57. The SSQ and the satisfaction score have a correlation of 0.34.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt; The SSQ has high [[internal consistency]] among items.&lt;ref name="ADA100464" /&gt;

==Linkages==
The SSQ has been used to show a positive [[correlation and dependence]] between Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Social Support in a study of adolescents and long-term outcomes in Gonaives, Haiti. The study looked at the traumas stemming from the natural disasters of 2004, 2008 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Multi-natural disasters in Gonaïves Haiti: long-term outcomes among child and adolescents and social support. | pmid=25585481 | volume=16 | journal=Int J Emerg Ment Health | pages=292–7 | last1 = Derivois | first1 = D | last2 = Cénat | first2 = JM | last3 = Mérisier | first3 = GG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSQ has also been used to show that higher levels of social support correlated with less suicide ideation in Military Medical University Soldiers in Iran in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Structural Equation Modeling of the Relationships between Depression, Drug Abuse and&amp;nbsp;Social Support&amp;nbsp;with Suicidal Ideation among Soldiers in Iran in 2015 | pmid=28087854 | volume=16 | journal=J Res Health Sci | pages=212–216 | last1 = Nosratabadi | first1 = M | last2 = Halvaiepour | first2 = Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; A low level of social support is an important risk factor in women for [[dysmenorrhea]] or menstrual cramps.

==Related Surveys==

=== SSQ3 ===

The SSQ3 is a short form of the SSQ and has only three questions. The SSQ3 has acceptable test-test reliability and correlation with personality variables as compared to the long form of the Social Support Questionnaire. The internal reliability was borderline but this low level of internal reliability is as expected since there are only three questions.&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt;

=== SSQ6 ===

The SSQ6 is a short form of the SSQ. The SSQ6 has been shown to have high correlation with: the SSQ, SSQ personality variables and internal reliability. In the development of the SSQ6, the research suggests that professed social support in adults may be a connected to “early attachment experience.”&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt; The SSQ6 consists of the below 6 questions:

1. Whom can you really count on to be dependable when you need help?

2. Whom can you really count on to help you feel more relaxed when you are under pressure or tense?

3. Who accepts you totally, including both your worst and your best points?

4. Whom can you really count on to care about you, regardless of what is happening to you?

5. Whom can you really count on to help you feel better when you are feeling generally down-in-the-dumps?

6. Whom can you count on to console you when you are very upset?&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly" /&gt;

===Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL)===

The Interpersonal Support Evaluation List includes 40 items (questions) with four sub-scales in the areas of Tangible Support, Belonging Support, Self-Esteem Support and Appraisal Support. The interviewee rates each item based on how true or false they feel the item is for themselves. The four total response options are “Definitely True”, “Probably True”, “Probably False”, and “Definitely False”.&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt;

'''Starfish Greathearts Foundation''' is an international non-governmental organisation formed in response to the tragedy of children orphaned or left vulnerable by the [[HIV/AIDS]] pandemic in South Africa. Its mission is to help make a difference to the lives of these children through community-based organisations working at grassroots level. This enables individual communities to develop their own solutions to the challenges they face. As of January 2009, Starfish projects reach more than 36,000 children in 120 communities across South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Starfish Greathearts Foundation. "Annual Report 2008". Starfish United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starfish Greathearts Foundation is registered as a charity (1093862) and company (4528018) in the United Kingdom. Starfish Greathearts Foundation UK delivers development programmes through Starfish Greathearts Foundation South Africa, which is a non-profit organisation (039-447-NPO), Section 21 Company (2003/002865/08) and Public Benefit Organisation (930008639) in South Africa. Starfish launched Starfish Greathearts Foundation USA as a full-time office in New York in 2007 and also has a volunteer division in Canada.

Starfish Greathearts Foundation UK is a member of the UK Consortium on AIDS and International Development as well as the Fundraising Standards Board, a self-regulatory scheme to ensure best practice in fundraising.

== Types of assistance ==

=== Crisis intervention ===
Starfish supports newly orphaned children, or those left to look after sick and dying parents, with food parcels to enable them to stay alive during times of crisis. The parcels typically contain maize meal, beans, peanut butter, sugar and salt to enable a family of four to survive for a month.

Emergency food parcels enable staff to build up a relationship with the children. The parcels are used as a short term tool to enable families and children to survive until they can be linked to a more secure and sustainable source of food such as vegetable gardening and government grants, in addition to long term support structures and social services.

School represents the one sustainable means of building independent and economically active lives for children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avert.org/aidsorphans.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as enabling orphaned children to apply for school fees exemption, Starfish projects crucially provide the necessary support around education such as the provision of school uniforms, shoes, stationery and books.

=== Working with communities ===

It is widely accepted, based on experience of organisations in South Africa and throughout the rest of the continent where large populations of AIDS orphans exist, that the best models of care for vulnerable and orphaned children are found within the children’s communities, not in institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PDF from aidsalliance |url=http://www.aidsalliance.org/graphics/OVC/documents/cp/0000857e00.pdf|work=http://www.aidsalliance.org/|publisher=[[International HIV/AIDS Alliance]]}}{{Dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, communities in Africa have helped neighbours in crisis. But the huge numbers of children orphaned by HIV/AIDS in South Africa needing support mean that community groups require assistance to effectively care for children. Starfish Greathearts provides financial support and expertise to help community-based groups deliver best practice care and assistance to orphaned and vulnerable children.
Starfish project partners provide:
* Nutritional support
* Day care and pre-school for infants and young children
* Psychosocial care for traumatised children
* Homework support for older children
* Safe and caring environments in which children can play and socialise
* Government grant facilitation for child headed households and foster care families
* Caregivers giving direct support for child headed households until children can be linked to foster care families

=== Building sustainable capacity ===

There currently exists thousands of [[Community organization|Community Based Organisations]] (CBOs) that work to support orphaned children and adults at risk due to HIV/AIDS. These organisations deliver a range of education and health support services. However, donors and the government are unable to work with these CBOs because they have no formal framework, infrastructures such as bank accounts, or non-profit organisation registration. Staff and volunteers require training and skills around budgeting and financial management, fundraising, business plans and codes of conduct. The majority of staff and volunteers have also received little or no training in regards to care of orphans and children's rights.
Starfish works to increase the capacity and impact of these grassroots organisations through the provision of training and mentoring, empowering communities to respond to the needs of orphans in their area in the long term. The aim is to develop a large number of stable and well run CBOs capable of working with the government to ensure delivery of care, resources and services to children made orphaned by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

The Starfish training and mentoring programme focuses on CBOs that have reached a certain level of development, and require a programme of training and support with a capacity building approach to achieve their full potential and output levels. Training includes orphan care, children's rights, bookkeeping and donor acquisition to enable the CBOs to become sustainable in the long term.

== Fundraising highlights ==

Key income generating activities include:

'''Campaigns and Community Support'''
The supporter base of Starfish Greathearts Foundation is based on widespread support from individuals through donations and income generated through successful campaigns. The Dinners of Hope Campaign is the most popular ongoing campaign that Starfish has developed. It is simple in the fact that everyone has to eat and therefore everyone can participate in the campaign. The emphasis of this campaign brings to the table the chance to educate, communicate and fundraise with minimal input and optimal results.  The concept is simple in that supporters are asked to host a meal for family, friends or colleagues and then ask guests for a doantion rather than a contribution to the meal. The campaign also works as a powerful tool in promoting HIV/AIDS awareness and education at all levels. The campaign has mobilised more than 20,000 individuals and 120 corporations worldwide to participate.

'''Charitable Trust and Foundations Support'''
Support from charitable trusts, foundations and development agencies constitutes an important part of maintaining the work of Starfish. The organisation has a track record of securing grants of varying sizes in the UK, USA and in South Africa. The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation donated over R1.2 million to Starfish in 2003 for key projects in KwaZulu-Natal, whilst more recently The Makro Foundation donated R240,000 towards children's educational needs in the Thandanani Programme.

In the UK, the charity is supported by more than 50 charitable trusts and foundations with grants ranging from £200 to more than £70,000 from organisations. Starfish has previously received statuory support from Isle of Man Government Overseas Aid Committee.

'''Corporate Support'''
Corporate supporters globally has included [[Anglo American plc]], [[BP]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[SABMiller plc]], [[Virgin Atlantic]], [[Virgin Media]], [[Virgin Megastores]] and [[Xstrata]]. Saracens Premiership Rugby Club, also known as [[Saracens F.C.]], are the latest major partner to lend their support to the charity having visited one of their projects in January 2009.

'''US President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief'''
Much of the expansion of the charity's work in South Africa has only been possible through the support of the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief, which has donated more than R30&amp;nbsp;million to date. In 2003, the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ([[PEPFAR]]) was launched to combat global HIV/AIDS – the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in history.

In [[dentistry]], the '''subepithelial connective tissue graft''' ('''SECT graft''', and sometimes referred to simply as a ''connective tissue (CT) graft'') is an oral and maxillofacial surgical procedure first described by Alan Edel in 1974.&lt;ref name="Edel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edel |first=Alan |date=1974 |title=Clinical evaluation of free connective tissue grafts used to increase the width of keratinized gingiva |journal=Journal of Clinical Periodontology |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=185–196 |pmid=4533490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, it is generally used to obtain root coverage following [[gingival recession]], which was a later development by Burt Langer in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wennstrom |first1=JL |last2=Pini Prato |first2=GP |chapter=Mucogingival Therapy — Periodontal Plastic Surgery |date=2003 |editor1-last=Lindhe |editor1-first=Jan |editor2-last=Karring |editor2-first=Thorkild |editor3-last=Lang |editor3-first=Niklaus P. |title=Clinical Periodontology and Implant Dentistry |edition=4th |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Munksgaard |page=607 |isbn=978-1-4051-0236-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
Similar to the [[free gingival graft]], the SECT graft can be described as a ''free [[autotransplantation|autogenous]] graft''.  The term ''free'' describes how the graft is completely removed from the donor site rather than remaining attached via a pedicle.  The term ''autogenous'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ''auto-'' ("self"), describes how the individual who receives the graft is the same individual who provides the donor tissue.&lt;ref name="CALAGNA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Langer |first1=B. |last2=Calagna |first2=L. |date=1980 |title=The subepithelial connective tissue graft |journal=J Prosth Dent |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=363–367 |pmid=6931898}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The connective tissue is generally taken from the [[hard palate]], although it may be taken from other sites as well, such as the maxillary tuberosity area.  Because the [[connective tissue]] for the graft is transplanted without the superficial [[epithelium]] from the donor site, it is termed ''subepithelial''.

==History==
As initially described by Edel, the treatment objective was to increase the zone of keratinized tissue.&lt;ref name="Edel"/&gt;  Others, including Broome and Taggert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Broome |first1=William C. |last2=Taggert |first2=Edward J. |date=October 1976 |title=Free autogenous connective tissue grafting: report of two cases |journal=Journal of Periodontology |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=580–585 |doi=10.1902/jop.1976.47.10.580}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Donn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Donn |first=Burt J. |date=May 1978 |title=The free connective tissue autograft: a clinical and histologic wound healing study in humans |journal=Journal of Periodontology |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=253–260 |doi=10.1902/jop.1978.49.5.253 |pmid=277676}}&lt;/ref&gt; also described the use of SECT grafts for increasing the zone of keratinized tissue.

Of the various ways of preparing the graft recipient site, Edel described using two vertical incisions, [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|mesial]] and [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|distal]] to the teeth at which the zone of keratinized tissue was intended to be widened.&lt;ref name="Edel"/&gt;

[[File:SECT2.jpg|thumb|right|450px|{{ordered list |Ipsilateral palatal mucosa serving as the donor site |The retrieved connective tissue, approximately 25 × 6&amp;nbsp;mm in dimension |Connective tissue placed at recipient site |Recipient site flap coronally advanced and sutured to entirely cover the graft}}]]
At the donor site, Edel described three methods for choosing and preparing the donor site to obtain connective tissue for the SECT graft:
# palatal partial thickness flap
# palatal full-partial thickness flap
# tuberosity partial thickness flap

Contrary to the donor site for a [[free gingival graft]], the surgeon is able to achieve primary closure at the donor site for a SECT.

Langer later described the SECT as a method by which to augment concavities and irregularities of the alveolar ridge following traumatic [[tooth extraction|extractions]], advanced [[periodontitis]] or developmental defects.&lt;ref name="CALAGNA"/&gt;  Currently, though, such augmentation of hard tissue defects tends to be done with hard tissue replacements, namely bone graft materials.

However, it was only in 1985 that Langer proposed the SECT for root coverage following [[gingival recession]].&lt;ref name="LANGER"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Langer |first1=Burton |last2=Langer |first2=Laureen |date=December 1985 |title=The subepithelial connective tissue graft technique for root coverage |journal=Journal of Periodontology |volume=56 |issue=12 |pages=715–720 |doi=10.1902/jop.1985.56.12.715 |pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
The SECT graft is a sort of hybrid procedure that combines the [[gingival graft|pedicle flap]] with the [[free gingival graft]] and enjoys the benefits of both.  Pedicle flaps alone, such as the [[gingival graft|coronally advanced flap]], frequently suffer from retraction and muscle pull.&lt;ref name="LANGER"/&gt;

==Technique==
Although there are various ways in which to carry out this procedure, all share a common sequence of steps:
# Prepare the recipient site of tissue exhibiting recession by incising the gingivae
# Obtain the SECT from the donor site
# Secure the SECT at the recipient site
# Suture the incised gingival tissue at both the donor and recipient sites
The donor site might be sutured closed either before or after securing the donor tissue to the recipient site

The '''Terma Foundation''' was founded in 1993 as the '''Tibet Child Nutrition Project''' ('''TCNP'''), by Dr. [[Nancy S. Harris]] and now implements public health programs including nutrition, education, primary and preventive health care, acknowledging traditional belief systems, and integrating low-tech, low-cost western [[technology]] where appropriate in [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=4438&amp;article=American+Doctor+Honored+for+Health+Projects+in+Tibet&amp;t=1&amp;c=1 American Doctor Honored for Health Projects in Tibet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Craig, [http://www.terma.org/shambhalasun052004.pdf Saving Tibet's Children] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728090113/http://www.terma.org/shambhalasun052004.pdf |date=2011-07-28 }}, ''Shambhala Sun'', May 2000, pp. 52-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terma's work in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and adjacent ethnic Tibetan areas of the [[People's Republic of China]] is carried out by a multidisciplinary coalition of [[Tibetans]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and [[Westerners]] in successful cooperation with PRC nationals and local health authorities.

Dr. Harris gained notoriety when she published an article in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] with the results of her study on stunted growth in the [[Himalaya]] region. She measured 2,500 children in rural villages and concluded that malnutrition was the cause rather than altitude, as previously suspected. To aid their work with local communities, the organization conducted a systematic study on the effectiveness of traditional Tibetan medicine in preventing and treating child health problems. They also studied the impact of vitamins and sunlight exposure in preventing rickets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723022539/http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com/dingo/Province/Tibet/1-43-0-207-0-0.html China Development Brief]&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation's field operations, based in Lhasa, now reach an estimated 300,000 child and community beneficiaries each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofchildren.org/honorees/2006-honorees/54-nancy-harris World of Children Award Nominees]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of the foundation include:

• Focusing on the health and welfare of children, women, and the elderly who maintain indigenous values while confronting contemporary challenges;

• Promoting environmentally appropriate traditional agriculture, consumption of high nutrient indigenous foods, and cultivation of Tibetan herbs;

• Supporting educational programs in public health, literacy, vocational training, the arts, and international education exchange;

• Developing microeconomic initiatives at the grassroots level which will sustain the local health infrastructure; and

• Facilitating interaction between Tibetans and other indigenous communities internationally and on issues relating to health, education, and the environment.

==Technology==
Patients suffering from tinnitus can use the Tinnitracks software to filter their individual tinnitus frequency from their music songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medcrunch.net/tech-meets-medical-innovation-meet-tinnitracks/|title=When Old Tech Meets Medical Innovation – Meet Tinnitracks|work=MedCrunch.et|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; By processing a song, the defined frequency is extracted creating a gap called “notch” in the frequency-profile that covers the exact tinnitus frequency as well as about an octave around it. Afterwards, the software checks if the audio profile of the song meets the criteria for the tinnitus treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.digitalhealthgermany.com/97/tinnitracks/ |title=Tinnitracks – fighting tinnitus with music |publisher=Digitalhealthgermany.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accuracy of frequency measurement is paramount in the process, which is why patients are required to visit ENT specialists or acousticians to create an accurate tinnitus audiogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thieme.de/de/gesundheit/tinnitracks-59941.htm |title=Tinnitracks - TRIAS Verlag - Gesundheit |publisher=Thieme.de |date= |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Treatment==
Tinnitracks is based on the Tailor-Made Notched Music Training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmnmt.com|title=Tailor-Made Notched Music Training - TMNMT|work=TMNMT.com|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; (TMNMT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.abstract |title=Listening to tailor-made notched music reduces tinnitus loudness and tinnitus-related auditory cortex activity |date= |accessdate=2015-05-07 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0911268107|pmc=2824261}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This approach uses filtered music to reduce the tinnitus loudness. The name TMNMT already stresses the importance of individualization in the whole set-up and refers both to the patient’s individual tinnitus frequency and the use of the patient’s favourite music. By filtering the tinnitus frequency from the music the frequency profile of a song is changed affecting the reactions induced in certain areas of the auditory cortex. Those cortical areas correlated to the frequency that got filtered are no longer stimulated.

'''Vinohrady Water Tower''' ({{lang-cs|Vinohradská vodárna}}) is a building in [[Vinohrady]] in [[Prague 10]] which was originally built as a water tower. Today its architecture is acknowledged as culturally important although it is now converted to accommodate offices and apartments. The viewing platform at the top is 40 metres above the street level.

==History==
The Vinohrady water tower building was created in 1882 to house steam engines and an underground reservoir. The engines pumped water up from the reservoir, creating a gravitational feed to nearby homes and businesses. Antonin Turek designed the building while he was the municipal architect.&lt;ref name=stove&gt;[http://stovezata.praha.eu/en-water-tower-of-vinohrady.html Water Tower of Vinohrady], stovezata.praha.eu, retrieved 14 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

The seventh floor originally contained a tank that could hold 200 cubic metres of water.&lt;ref name=stove/&gt; Initially this was pumped from the [[River Vltava]] until 1912, when the water source was switched to a plant at [[Káraný]]. The water descended from the tank to supply [[Strašnice]], [[Žižkov]] and [[Vršovice (Prague)|Vršovice]] with drinking water.&lt;ref name=stove/&gt;

In 1914 the tower's steam engines were replaced with electric motors. The revised system used water that was treated at a plant at [[Podolí (Prague)|Podolí]] and then stored in water tanks underground before being pumped to the top of this tower for use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digital-guide.cz/en/poi/vinohrady-2/vinohrady-water-tower/ Vonohrady Water Tower], Prague Minos Guide, retrieved 14 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Today its architecture is acknowledged to be of national historical importance, even though the building serves no modern purpose for water supply, as the motors, pumps and pipes have been removed. In 1993, the inside was converted to accommodate offices and apartments.&lt;ref name=desit&gt;[http://desitka.cz/368-vinohradska-vodarna-cerpala-vodu-primo-z-vltavy.html Vinohrady waterworks pump water directly from the river], Desitka.cz, retrieved 17 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The viewing platform at the top is 40 metres above the street level – once this provided a commanding view of the area, but today it is only slightly taller than the tenements that surround the tower.  On each corner there are the statues of angels with clock faces between them. Below the clocks are four medallions celebrating Vinohrady.&lt;ref name=desit&gt;[http://desitka.cz/368-vinohradska-vodarna-cerpala-vodu-primo-z-vltavy.html Vinohrady waterworks pump water directly from the river], Desitka.cz, retrieved 17 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 the tower was recognised as being of cultural importance and was listed by the [[Czech Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://monumnet.npu.cz/pamfond/list.php?IdReg=159933 Water Tower – ref 47348/1-2151], monumnet.npu.cz, retrieved 17 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willi Unsoeld''' (October 5, 1926 – March 4, 1979) was an [[United States|American]] [[mountaineering|mountaineer]] who, along with [[Tom Hornbein]], were members of the first American expedition to summit [[Mount Everest]] on May 22, 1963.  Unsoeld and Hornbein's legendary climb was the first ascent from the peak's west ridge, and the first major [[Traverse (climbing)|traverse]] of a Himalayan peak.  His subsequent activities included working as a [[U.S. Forest Service]] [[Smokejumper]], [[Peace Corps]] director in [[Nepal]], speaker for [[Outward Bound]], faculty member at [[Oregon State University]]&lt;ref name=nwda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwda-db.orbiscascade.org/findaid/ark:/80444/xv11643 |title=Guide to the Willi Unsoeld Collection 1963–1979 |publisher=Nwda-db.orbiscascade.org |date=1979-03-04 |accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Evergreen State College]] and mountaineering guide.  An avalanche during a winter climb of [[Mount Rainier]] took his life.

==Early life==
Born in [[Arcata, California]], Unsoeld was raised in [[Eugene, Oregon]], and received degrees from [[Oregon State University]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and the [[University of Washington]].  He helped to create the OSC Mountain Club during his time at [[Oregon State University]].&lt;ref name=nwda/&gt;

==Everest ascent==

In the late 1950s he was a leading climbing guide in the [[Teton Range|Grand Teton Mountains]]. He climbed Mt. Rainier over 200 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everesthistory.com/climbers/unsoeld.htm|title=EverestHistory.com: Will Unsoeld|website=www.everesthistory.com|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsoeld and [[Tom Hornbein]] ascended Everest’s difficult West Ridge route in May 1963 on a [[National Geographic Society]] sponsored expedition while [[Barry Bishop (mountaineer)|Barry Bishop]] and [[Lute Jerstad]] followed [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]]’s South Col route established during their 1953 climb. It was the first simultaneous attempt from two directions.&lt;ref&gt;Hornbein, Thomas F. (1965). ''Everest: The West Ridge''. The Sierra Club. {{ISBN|0-04-796013-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unsworth, Walt. (1981) ''Everest''. Allen Lane (Penguin Books) {{ISBN|0-7139-1108-5}}. pp 363–392&lt;/ref&gt;

The grueling expedition cost Unsoeld nine of his toes and required several months of recovery in the hospital. Unsoeld and the team reunited in July 1963 when they were presented with the National Geographic Society’s highest honor, the [[Hubbard Medal]], by [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, James Ramsey. (1963) ''Americans on Everest''. J.B. Lippincott, Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
After his stint in the [[Peace Corps]], Unsoeld joined [[Outward Bound]] and traveled about the country giving speeches and promoting the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=JgEKGGYEpZIC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413&amp;dq=after+leaving+the+peace+corps+Willi+unsoeld++joined+the+team+of+outward+bound&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sPp8ItMKAu&amp;sig=Jnr_5Pf0AuE4EN4CkS-DFEA47a4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=after%20leaving%20the%20peace%20corps%20Willi%20unsoeld%20%20joined%20the%20team%20of%20outward%20bound&amp;f=false|title=Fallen Giants: A History of Himalayan Mountaineering from the Age of Empire to the Age of Extremes|last=Isserman|first=Maurice|last2=Weaver|first2=Stewart Angas|last3=Molenaar|first3=Dee|date=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=0300164203|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

After leaving Outward Bound he became one of the founding faculty at [[The Evergreen State College]] in Washington State. He was highlighted prominently in the first recruiting video in 1971, advising that "not every student should come to Evergreen".

It was at The Evergreen State College where he conceived an Outdoor Education Program. This program consisted of four distinct Habitat Groups, one of which was the Winter Mountaineering Group. Academic programs at the college at the time were designed to last a year or less.

==Personal life==
Unsoeld married [[Jolene Unsoeld|Jolene Bishoprick]] in the 1950s; they had two daughters and two sons. Jolene Unsoeld and their two sons, Krag and Regon, reside in Olympia, Washington. Their daughter Terres Unsoeld lives in California. Jolene Unsoeld served three terms in the U.S. Congress from 1989 to 1995.

In 1976, Unsoeld and his daughter Nanda Devi were on an expedition to climb her namesake mountain [[Nanda Devi]], the second highest peak in India. His daughter died during the climb, which was plagued by accidents and eventual tragedy. The reason for her death was blood clotting caused by the high altitude of the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wilderdom.com/Unsoeld.htm|title=Willi Unsoeld - Brief Biography &amp; Quotes|website=www.wilderdom.com|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked at his home (where a picture of Devi was displayed over the fireplace) how he could continue climbing after losing his daughter, Willi responded: "What, you want me to die of a heart attack, drinking beer, eating potato chips, and watching a golf tournament on TV?"&lt;ref&gt;Roskelly, John (2000) ''Nanda Devi: The Tragic Expedition'' Mountaineer Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Unsoeld died in an avalanche during an Outdoor Education Winter Expedition climb of Mt. Rainier in March 4, 1979, at the age of 52.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainzone.com/news/rainier6-11.html|title=Avalanche On Mount Rainier: Mountain Zone News|website=www.mountainzone.com|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was leading over a dozen students from The Evergreen State College on an ascent of Mt. Rainier at the time. He died during the descent from their high camp in Cadaver Gap along with one student, Janie Diepenbrock from Sacramento, California.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, R. (2002). ''Fatal mountaineer: The high-altitude life and death of Willi Unsoeld, American Himalayan legend.'' New York: St. Martin's Press. 306 pages. {{ISBN|0-312-26153-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A later analysis of the mishap, excerpts of which were published by the American Alpine Club, said in part: "There are many guides who would not have taken on this particular climb with this particular group, but this is a matter of personal preference rather than a determination as to whether this climb was proper to attempt or not." &lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/13198004002/Avalanche-Bad-Weather-Washington-Mt-Rainier Avalanche, Bad Weather, Washington, Mt. Rainier - AAC Publications - Search The American Alpine Journal and Accidents In North American Mountaineering&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Known as "The Father of Experiential Education,"&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, Laurence (1999) ''Ascent: The Spiritual and Physical Quest of Legendary Mountaineer Willi Unsoeld'' Quill books&lt;/ref&gt; Willi Unsoeld influenced the growth of [[outdoor education]], inspiring educational leaders like [[Simon Priest]]. His philosophical approach to living and global perspective mentored environmental visionaries like [[Caril Ridley]].

His philosophy focused on experiencing the sacred in nature, the importance of risk in education and getting personal experience rather than relying on the experience of others. His dynamic style of mentoring inspired thousands of followers. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Why don’t you stay in the wilderness?  Because that isn’t where it is at; it’s back in the city, back in downtown St. Louis, back in Los Angeles.  The final test is whether your experience of the sacred in nature enables you to cope more effectively with the problems of people.  If it does not enable you to cope more effectively with the problems – and sometimes it doesn’t, it sometimes sucks you right out into the wilderness and you stay there the rest of your Life – then when that happens, by my scale of value; it’s failed.  You go to nature for an experience of the sacred...to re-establish your contact with the core of things, where it’s really at, in order to enable you to come back to the world of people and operate more effectively.  Seek ye first the kingdom of nature, that the kingdom of man might be realized.&lt;ref&gt;Unsoeld, W. (1974). Spiritual values in wilderness.  Paper presented at the Association for Experiential Education Conference, Estes Park, CO.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Evergreen’s annual Willi Unsoeld Seminar is held as a living memorial to Unsoeld as a mountaineer, a philosopher and a theologian. {{cn|date=September 2015}}
