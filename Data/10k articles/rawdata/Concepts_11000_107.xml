      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11154">In [[model theory]], a discipline within [[mathematical logic]], an '''abstract elementary class''', or '''AEC''' for short, is a class of models  with a partial order similar to  the relation of an [[elementary substructure]] of an [[elementary class]] in [[first-order logic|first-order]] model theory. They were introduced by [[Saharon Shelah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shelah|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
&lt;math&gt;\langle K, \prec_K\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; a class of structures in some language &lt;math&gt;L = L(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is an AEC if it has the following properties:
* &lt;math&gt;\prec_K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partial order]] on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;M\prec_K N&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a substructure of &lt;math&gt; N&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Isomorphisms''': &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is closed under [[isomorphism]]s, and  if &lt;math&gt;M,N,M',N'\in K,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;f\colon M\simeq M',&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;g\colon N\simeq N',&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;f\subseteq g,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M\prec_K N,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;M'\prec_K N'.&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Coherence''': If &lt;math&gt;M_1\prec_K M_3,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;M_2\prec_K M_3,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_1\subseteq M_2,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;M_1\prec_K M_2.&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Tarski–Vaught [[Total order|chain]] axioms''': If &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an [[ordinal number|ordinal]] and &lt;math&gt;\{\,M_\alpha\mid \alpha&lt;\gamma\,\}\subseteq K&lt;/math&gt; is a chain (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\beta&lt;\gamma\implies M_\alpha\prec_K M_\beta&lt;/math&gt;), then:
**  &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\gamma} M_\alpha\in K&lt;/math&gt;
** If &lt;math&gt;M_\alpha\prec_K N&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\gamma} M_\alpha\prec_K N&lt;/math&gt;
* '''[[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem|Löwenheim–Skolem]] axiom''': There exists a [[cardinal number|cardinal]] &lt;math&gt;\mu \ge |L(K)| + \aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, such that if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the universe of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, then there is &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; whose universe contains &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\|N\|\leq |A|+\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N\prec_K M&lt;/math&gt;. We let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{LS}(K)&lt;/math&gt; denote the least such &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and call it the '''Löwenheim–Skolem number''' of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that we usually do not care about the models of size less than the Löwenheim–Skolem number and often assume that there are none (we will adopt this convention in this article). This is justified since we can always remove all such models from an AEC without influencing its structure above the Löwenheim–Skolem number.

A &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-embedding is a map &lt;math&gt;f: M \rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;M, N \in K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f[M] \prec_K N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;f[M]&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is clear from context, we omit it.

== Examples ==

The following are examples of abstract elementary classes:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|2002}}, Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

* An [[Elementary class]] is the most basic example of an AEC: If ''T'' is a first-order theory, then the class &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(T)&lt;/math&gt; of models of ''T'' together with [[elementary substructure]] forms an AEC with Löwenheim–Skolem number ''|T|''.
* If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a sentence in the [[infinitary logic]] &lt;math&gt;L_{\omega_1, \omega}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a countable [[fragment (logic)|fragment]] containing &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; \langle \operatorname{Mod}(T), \prec_{\mathcal{F}} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is an AEC with Löwenheim–Skolem number &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. This can be generalized to other logics, like &lt;math&gt;L_{\kappa, \omega}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;L_{\omega_1, \omega}(Q)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; expresses "there exists uncountably many".
* If ''T'' is a first-order countable [[superstable]] theory, the set of &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;-saturated models of ''T'', together with elementary substructure, is an AEC with Löwenheim–Skolem number &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Schanuel's conjecture#Zilber's pseudo-exponentiation|Zilber's pseudo-exponential fields]] form an AEC.

== Common assumptions ==

AECs are very general objects and one usually make some of the assumptions below when studying them:

* An AEC has ''joint embedding'' if any two model can be embedded inside a common model. 
* An AEC has ''no maximal model'' if any model has a proper extension.
* An AEC &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; has ''amalgamation'' if for any triple &lt;math&gt;M_0, M_1, M_2 \in K&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;M_0 \prec_K M_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_0 \prec_K M_2&lt;/math&gt;, there is &lt;math&gt;N \in K&lt;/math&gt; and embeddings of &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; inside &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; that fix &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; pointwise.

Note that in elementary classes, joint embedding holds whenever the theory is [[complete theory|complete]], while amalgamation and no maximal models are well-known consequences of the [[compactness theorem]]. These three assumptions allow us to build a universal model-homogeneous monster model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;, exactly as in the elementary case.

Another assumption that one can make is [[Tame abstract elementary class|tameness]].

== Shelah's categoricity conjecture ==

Shelah introduced AECs to provide a uniform framework in which to generalize first-order [[Stable theory|classification theory]]. Classification theory started with [[Morley's categoricity theorem]], so it is natural to ask whether a similar result holds in AECs. This is '''Shelah's eventual categoricity conjecture'''. It states that there should be a Hanf number for categoricity:

For every AEC ''K'' there should be a cardinal &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; depending only on &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{LS}(K)&lt;/math&gt; such that if ''K'' is categorical in ''some'' &lt;math&gt;\lambda \geq \mu&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. ''K'' has exactly one (up to isomorphism) model of size &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;), then ''K'' is categorical in &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; for ''all'' &lt;math&gt;\theta \ge \mu&lt;/math&gt;.

Shelah also has several stronger conjectures: The threshold cardinal for categoricity is the Hanf number of psedo elemtary classes in a language of cardinality LS(K).  More specifically when the class is in a countable language and axiomaziable by an &lt;math&gt;L_{\omega_1,\omega}&lt;/math&gt; sentence the threshold number for categoricity is &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\omega_1}&lt;/math&gt;.  This conjecture dates back to 1976.

Several approximations have been published (see for example the results section below), assuming [[set theory|set-theoretic]] assumptions (such as the existence of [[large cardinals]] or variations of the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]]), or model-theoretic assumptions (such as amalgamation or tameness). As of 2014, the original conjecture remains open.

== Results ==
The following are some important results about AECs. Except for the last, all results are due to Shelah.

* '''Shelah's Presentation Theorem''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|2002}}, Theorem 3.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Any AEC &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PC}_{2^{\operatorname{LS}(K)}}&lt;/math&gt;: it is a reduct of a class of models of a first-order theory omitting at most &lt;math&gt;2^{\operatorname{LS}(K)}&lt;/math&gt; [[type (model theory)|types]].
* '''Hanf number for existence''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|2002}}, Corollary 3.5. Note that there is a typo there and that &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{\operatorname{LS}(K)}}&lt;/math&gt; should be replaced by &lt;math&gt;2^{\operatorname{LS}(K)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Any AEC &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; which has a model of size &lt;math&gt;\beth_{(2^{\operatorname{LS}(K)})^+}&lt;/math&gt; has models of arbitrarily large sizes.
* '''Amalgamation from categoricity''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|2002}}, Theorem 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt; If ''K'' is an AEC categorical in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2^\lambda &lt; 2^{\lambda^+}&lt;/math&gt;, then ''K'' has amalgamation for models of size &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Existence from categoricity''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|2002}}, Theorem 5.1.&lt;/ref&gt; If ''K'' is a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PC}_{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; AEC with Löwenheim–Skolem number &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and ''K'' is categorical in &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, then ''K'' has a model of size &lt;math&gt;\aleph_2&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, no sentence of &lt;math&gt;L_{\omega_1, \omega}(Q)&lt;/math&gt; can have exactly one uncountable model.
* '''Approximations to Shelah's categoricity conjecture''': 
**'''Downward transfer from a successor''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shelah|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If ''K'' is an abstract elementary class with amalgamation that is categorical in a "high-enough" [[successor cardinal|successor]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, then ''K'' is categorical in all high-enough &lt;math&gt;\mu \le \lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
** '''Shelah's categoricity conjecture for a successor from large cardinals''':&lt;ref&gt;This is due to Will Boney, but combines results of many people, including Grossberg, Makkai, Shelah, and VanDieren. A proof appears in {{harvnb|Boney|2014}}, Theorem 7.5.&lt;/ref&gt; If there are class-many [[strongly compact cardinal]]s, then Shelah's categoricity conjecture holds when we start with categoricity at a successor.

The '''International Day for the Universal Access to Information''' (commonly called the '''Access to Information Day''') is an international day of recognition designated by the [[UNESCO]] General Conference to be held on [[September 28]]. The day was inaugurated in November 2015 and was first held on September 28, 2016.

The day had been recognised as [[International Right to Know Day]] since 2002 and was developed by international civil society advocates into its current form beginning in 2012. The UNESCO resolution creating the day was pushed by African civil society groups seeking greater information [[transparency (behaviour)|transparency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/11/unesco-names-sept-28-access-to-information-day/|title=UNESCO Names Sept. 28 Access to Information Day|last=|first=|date=17 November 2015|publisher=freedominfo.org|access-date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently only 17 African Union member states have adopted national [[right to know|right to information]] laws, and groups like Open Government Partnership hope that the recognition of the right to information will "provide an important platform for all stakeholders at national level to discuss the adoption and effective implementation of national right to information laws in line with continental and international standards and obligations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/blog-editor/2015/11/25/international-day-universal-access-information-new-opportunity-advance|title=INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO INFORMATION: A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE OPEN GOVERNMENTS!|last=Sendugwa|first=Gilbert|date=25 November 2015|publisher=Open Government Partnership|access-date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, African civil society groups like MISA Zimbabwe have noted that states like Zimbabwe which do have Right to Information laws still have a long way to go to ensure they improve governance. In 2016, MISA Zimbabwe used Access to Information Day to criticise Zimbabwe's poor information transparency provisions, noting that, "While Zimbabwe was one of the first African countries to adopt an [[access to information]] law in the form of the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA), the law in question is a far cry from its purported import and impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thezimbabwean.co/2016/09/misa-zimbabwe-commemorates-international-day-for-universal-access-to-information/|title=MISA-Zimbabwe commemorates International Day for Universal Access to Information|last=MISA|first=|date=28 September 2016|website=thezimbabwean.co|publisher=The Zimbabwean|access-date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation of perpetrators==
The intention of the attacker is often to humiliate rather than to kill the victim. In Britain such attacks, particularly those against men, are believed to be underreported, and as a result many of them do not show up in official statistics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Some of the most common motivations of perpetrators include:
* Personal conflict regarding intimate relationships, and sexual rejection&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673610618636/fulltext?rss=yes|title=DEFINE_ME_WA|journal=The Lancet|volume=376|issue=9748|page=1209|accessdate=20 April 2016 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61863-6|year=2010|last1=Solberg|first1=Kristin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; 
* Racial motivations
* Sexual related jealousy and lust&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206231722/http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 February 2017|title=Wayback Machine|date=6 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social, political and religious motivations
* Gang violence and rivalry
* Attacks against minorities
* Conflicts over land ownership, farm animals, housing and property&lt;ref name=Bahl_Syed/&gt;
* Revenge for refusal of sexual advances, proposals of [[marriage]] and demands for [[dowry]]&lt;ref name="Bandyopadhyay_Khan" /&gt;

Acid attacks often occur as revenge against a woman who rejects a proposal of marriage or a sexual advance.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite news | last = de Castella | first = Tom | title=How many acid attacks are there? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23631395 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=9 August 2013 |accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=6a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mannan|first=A.|author2=S.

Attacks against individuals based on their religious beliefs or social or political activities also occur. These attacks may be targeted against a specific individual, due to their activities, or may be perpetrated against random persons merely because they are part of a social group or community. In Europe, [[Konstantina Kouneva]], currently a member of the [[European Parliament]], had acid thrown on her in 2008, in what was described as "the most severe assault on a trade unionist in Greece for 50 years."&lt;ref name=kk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus-fen.net/opinion/0000/00/00/1819/|title=Kuneva case – the most severe assault on trade unionist in Greece for 50 years|work=FOCUS Information Agency|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female students have had acid thrown in their faces as a punishment for attending school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/03/world/asia/pakistan-acid-attack/|title=Pakistani Taliban target female students with acid attack|author=Shaan Khan, CNN|date=3 November 2012|work=CNN|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acid attacks due to [[religious conflicts]] have been also reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themediaproject.org/article/acid-attack-injures-roman-catholic-priest-tanzania?page=full|title=Acid attack injures Catholic priest|work=The Media Project|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-24088096|title=Catholic priest targeted in acid attack in Zanzibar|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both males and females have been victims of acid attacks for refusing to convert to another religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/christian-woman-throws-acid-on-hindu-ex-boyfriend-after-he-refuses-to-convert-269758.html|title=26YO Woman Throws Acid On Ex-Boyfriend After He Refused To Convert To Her Religion For Marriage|work=indiatimes.com|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, anecdotal evidence for acid attacks exists in other regions of the world such as [[South America]], [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=13a /&gt; However, [[South Asia]]n countries maintain the highest incidence of acid attacks.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

Police in the United Kingdom have noted that many victims are afraid to come forward to report attacks, meaning the true scale of the problem may be unknown.&lt;ref name=telegraph_policestats&gt;{{cite news|title=True scale of acid attacks hidden as victims too scared to come forward, police say|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/22/partner-towie-star-wanted-nightclub-acid-attack-thought-have/|date=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==
An accurate estimate of the gender ratio of victims and perpetrators is difficult to establish because many acid attacks are not reported or recorded by authorities. According to a 2010 study in ''[[The Lancet]]'', there are "no reliable statistics" on the prevalence of acid attacks in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A 2007 literature review analyzed 24 studies in 13 countries over the past 40 years, covering 771 cases.&lt;ref name=3a/&gt; According to the London-based charity Acid Survivors Trust International 60% of acid attacks are on women, and acid assaults are grossly under-estimated. In some regions, assaults perpetrated on female victims by males are often driven by the mentality "If I can't have you, no one shall."&lt;ref&gt;Bhalla, Nita (9 July 2013) [http://www.trust.org/item/20130709160626-j5dfo/?source=dpagehead India's top court says gov't not trying to stop acid attacks]. ''Thomson Reuters Foundation''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bangladesh, throwing acid has been labeled as a "gender crime", as there is a dominance of female victims who are assaulted by males, for the reason of refusing to marry, or refusing sexual advances from male perpetrators&lt;ref name="kln.ac.lk"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.burns.2006.05.002|pmid=17095164|url=http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206231722/http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-02-06|title=Cases of chemical assault worldwide: A literature review|journal=Burns|volume=33|issue=2|page=149|year=2007|last1=Mannan|first1=Ashim|last2=Ghani|first2=Samuel|last3=Clarke|first3=Alex|last4=Butler|first4=Peter E.M.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In Jamaica, women throwing acid on other women in relation to fights over male partners is a common cause.&lt;ref name="kln.ac.lk"/&gt; In the UK, the majority of victims are men, and many of these attacks are related to gang violence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Another factor that puts victims at increased risk for an acid assault is their [[socioeconomic status]], as those living in [[poverty]] are more likely to be attacked.&lt;ref name=2a /&gt;&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; {{as of|2013}}, the three nations with the most noted incidence of acid attacks – Bangladesh, India, and Cambodia – were ranked 75th, 101st, and 104th, respectively, out of 136 countries on the [[Global Gender Gap]] Index, a scale that measures equality in opportunities between men and women in nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2013.pdf|title=The Global Gender Gap report|website=3.weforum.org|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug cartels such as the [[Los Zetas]] are known to use acid on civilians. For example, In the [[2011 San Fernando massacre]], Los Zetas members took away children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the civilians in a bus. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten.

Acid attacks are often referred to as a "[[crime of passion]]", fueled by jealousy and revenge.&lt;ref name=3a /&gt; Actual cases though, show that they are usually the result of rage at a woman who rebuffs the advances of a male. For the country of Bangladesh, such passion is often rooted in [[marriage]] and relationships. One study showed that refusal of [[marriage proposal]]s accounted for 55% of acid assaults, with abuse from a husband or other family member (18%), property disputes (11%) and refusal of sexual or romantic advances (2%) as other leading causes.&lt;ref name="6a"/&gt; Additionally, the use of acid attacks in dowry arguments has been reported in Bangladesh,&lt;ref name=2a /&gt; with 15% of cases studied by the [[Acid Survivors Foundation]] citing dowry disputes as the motive.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; The chemical agents most commonly used to commit these attacks are [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref name=Anwary1&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Anwary | first = Afroza | date = 2002 | title = Acid Violence And Medical Care In Bangladesh: Women's Activism as Carework |journal= Gender &amp; Society | pages = 305–313 | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1177/0891243202250851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police in India are also known to use acid on individuals, particularly on their eyes, causing blindness to the victims. A well known such case is the [[1980 Bhagalpur blindings|Bhagalpur blindings]], where police blinded 31 individuals under trial (or convicted criminals, according to some versions) by pouring acid into their eyes. The incident was widely discussed, debated and acutely criticized by several human rights organizations. The Bhagalpur blinding case had made criminal jurisprudence history by becoming the first in which the Indian Supreme Court ordered compensation for violation of basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/special-report/story/19801231-bhagalpur-blindings-represents-one-of-the-darkest-chapters-in-indias-history-773650-2013-11-29|title=Bhagalpur blindings represents one of the darkest chapters in India's history|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
According to ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[Nicholas D. Kristof]], acid attacks are at an all-time high in Pakistan and increasing every year.

====China====
The [[Hong Kong acid attacks|Mong Kok acid attacks]] were incidents in 2008, 2009, and 2010 where plastic bottles filled with [[corrosive]] liquid ([[drain cleaner]]) were thrown onto shoppers on [[Sai Yeung Choi Street]] South, Hong Kong, a pedestrian street and popular shopping area. A reward, originally [[HK$]]100,000, for information about the perpetrator or perpetrators, was raised to [[HK$]]300,000 following the second incident, and cameras were to be installed in the area following the December incident. The third incident occurred the very day the cameras were turned on. The fifth incident happened after Hong Kong government announced its new strategies against the incident. 130 people were injured in these attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/hongkong/6961804/Hong-Kong-acid-attack-man-arrested-after-tourists-targeted.html|title=Hong Kong acid attack: man arrested after tourists targeted|last=Eimer|first=David|date=2010|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies on acid attacks in Cambodia found the victims were almost equally likely to be men or women (48.4% men, 51.6% women).&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; As with [[India]], rates of acid attacks in Cambodia have generally increased in the past decades, with a high rate of 40 cases reported for 2000 that started the increasing trend.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; According to the [[Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity]], 216 acid attacks were reported from 1985 to 2009, with 236 reported victims.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt; Jealousy and hate is the biggest motivator for acid attacks in Cambodia, as 28% of attacks reported those emotions as the cause.

A particularly high-profile case of this nature was the attack on Cambodian teenager [[Tat Marina]] in 1999, allegedly carried out by the jealous wife of a government official (the incident prompted a rash of [[copycat crime]]s that year, raising the number from seven in 1998 to 40 in 1999).

She was 33 years old. &lt;ref&gt;https://en.hromadske.ua/posts/ukrainian-activist-and-whistleblower-official-dies-after-acid-attack&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.rferl.org/a/ukrainian-activist-doused-with-acid-dies/29581875.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South America ===
'''Colombia'''[[File:Natalia Ponce de Leon IWOC 2.jpg|thumb|[[Natalia Ponce de León]] (right), survivor of a 2014 acid attack, receiving an award for her activism for other survivors]]
Though comprehensive statistics on acid attacks in [[South America]] are sparse, a recent study investigating acid assault in [[Bogota]], [[Colombia]], provides some insight for this region. According to the article, the first identified survivor of acid violence in Bogota was attacked 15 years ago. Since then reported cases have been increasing with time. The study also cited the Colombian Forensics Institute, which reported that 56 women complained of aggression by acid in 2010, 46 in 2011, and 16 during the first trimester of 2012. The average age of survivors was about 23 years old, but ranged from 13 to 41 years.&lt;ref name=15a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guerrero|first=Linda|title=Burns due to acid assaults in Bogotá, Colombia|journal=Burns|date=October 2012|pages=1–6|doi=10.1016/j.burns.2012.10.022|volume=39|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study reported a male:female victim ratio of 1:30 for acid assault in Bogota, Colombia, although recent reports show the ratio is closer to 1:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.las2orillas.co/hay-456-hombres-en-colombia-que-tambien-son-natalia-ponce/ | work=las2orillas | title=Hay 456 hombres en Colombia que también son Natalia Ponce | date=2014-04-10 | accessdate=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons behind these attacks usually stemmed from poor interpersonal relationships and domestic intolerance toward women. Moreover, female victims usually came from low [[socioeconomic class]]es and had low education. The authors state that the prevalence of acid attacks in other areas of South America remains unknown due to significant underreporting.&lt;ref name=15a /&gt;

On March 27, 2014, a woman named [[Natalia Ponce de León]] was assaulted by Jonathan Vega, who threw a liter of [[sulphuric acid]] on her face and body. Vega, a former neighbor, was reported to have been "obsessed" with Ponce de León and had been making death threats against her after she turned down his proposal for a relationship.&lt;ref name="america.aljazeera.com"/&gt; 24% of her body was severely burned as a result of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia: Man accused of high profile acid attack arrested. (2014). ''BBC News.'' Retrieved from: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-26906638&lt;/ref&gt; Ponce de León has undergone 15 [[Reconstructive surgery|reconstruction surgeries]] on her face and body since the attack.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/victim-horrific-acid-attack-removes-7209404|title=Victim of acid attack removes her mask to reveal her face for the first time|first=Winnie|last=Agbonlahor|date=20 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/11/survivors-of-acid-attacks-in-Colombia-fight-for-justice.html|title=Survivors of acid attacks in Colombia fight for justice|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years before the attack took place, [[Colombia]] reported one of the highest rates of [[acid attack]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s per capita in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fucsia.co/personajes/nacionales/article/colombia-lider-vergonzoso-en-ataques-con-acido/49533|title=Colombia, líder vergonzoso en ataques con ácido|website=Fucsia.co|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was not an effective law in place until Ponce de León's campaign took off in the months after her attack. The new law, which is named after her, defines acid attacks as a specific crime and increases [[Sentence (law)|maximum sentences]] to 50 years in jail for convicted offenders.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord3"/&gt; The law also aims to provide victims with better state medical care including reconstructive surgery and psychological therapy. Ponce de León expressed hope that the new law would act as a deterrent against future attacks.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord3" /&gt;

==Health effects==
The most notable effect of an acid attack is the lifelong bodily disfigurement. According to the [[Acid Survivors Foundation]] in [[Pakistan]], there is a high survival rate amongst victims of acid attacks. Consequently, the victim is faced with physical challenges, which require long-term surgical treatment, as well as psychological challenges, which require in-depth intervention from [[psychologist]]s and counselors at each stage of physical recovery.&lt;ref name=ASF&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Adnan|title=The real miracle workers fighting, and healing, Pakistan’s acid attacks|url=http://acidsurvivorspakistan.org/|publisher=Acid Survivors Foundation, Pakistan|date=Apr 21, 2012|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These far-reaching effects on their lives impact their psychological, social and economic viability in communities.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt;

===Medical===
The medical effects of acid attacks are extensive. As a majority of acid attacks are aimed at the face,&lt;ref name="3a" /&gt; several articles thoroughly reviewed the medical implications for these victims. The severity of the damage depends on the [[concentration]] of the acid and the time before the acid is thoroughly washed off with water or [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralized]] with a neutralizing agent. The acid can rapidly eat away skin, the layer of fat beneath the skin, and in some cases even the underlying bone. Eyelids and lips may be completely destroyed and the nose and ears severely damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cequinindia.org/pdf/Special_Reports/Acid%20Throwing.pdf|title=Gender-Based Violence In Public Places: Acid Throwing|author=Keerthi Bollineni|publisher=[[Centre for Equality and Inclusion]]|access-date=2012-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526012923/http://cequinindia.org/pdf/Special_Reports/Acid%20Throwing.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not exhaustive, Acid Survivors Foundation Uganda findings included:&lt;ref name="10a" /&gt;
* The [[skull]] is partly destroyed/deformed and hair lost.
* [[Ear]] cartilage is usually partly or totally destroyed; [[deafness]] may occur.
* [[Eyelids]] may be burned off or deformed, leaving the [[eye]]s extremely dry and prone to [[blindness]]. Acid directly in the eye also damages [[eyesight|sight]], sometimes causing blindness in both eyes.
* The [[nose]] can become shrunken and deformed; the [[nostril]]s may close off completely due to destroyed [[cartilage]].
* The [[mouth]] becomes shrunken and narrow, and it may lose its full range of motion. Sometimes, the [[lip]]s may be partly or totally destroyed, exposing the [[teeth]]. Eating and speaking can become difficult.
* [[Scar]]s can run down from the [[chin]] to [[neck]] area, shrinking the chin and extremely limiting [[range of motion]] in the neck.
* [[Inhalation]] of acid vapors usually creates [[respiratory]] problems, exacerbated restricted [[airway]] pathways (the [[esophagus]] and [[nostril]]s) in acid patients.

In addition to these above-mentioned medical effects, acid attack victims face the possibility of [[septicemia]], [[renal failure]], skin [[depigmentation]], and even death.&lt;ref name=5a /&gt;

A 2015 attack that involved throwing sulfuric acid on a man's face and body while he lay in bed caused him, among other serious injuries, to become paralyzed from the neck down.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/23/berlinah-wallace-jailed-years-sadistic-acid-attack-mark-van-dongen?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
Acid assault survivors face many [[mental health]] issues upon recovery. One study showed that when compared to published Western [[norm (social)|norms]] for psychological well-being, non-Caucasian acid attack victims reported higher levels of [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and scored higher on the Derriford appearance scale, which measures [[psychological distress]] due to one's concern for their appearance. Additionally, female victims reported lowered [[self-esteem]] according to the [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale|Rosenberg scale]] and increased [[self-consciousness]], both in general and in the social sphere.&lt;ref name=6a /&gt;

===Social===
In addition to medical and psychological effects, many social implications exist for acid survivors, especially women.&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; For example, such attacks usually leave victims [[handicapped]] in some way, rendering them dependent on either their spouse or family for everyday activities, such as eating and running errands. These dependencies are increased by the fact that many acid survivors are not able to find suitable work, due to impaired vision and [[Physical disability|physical handicap]]. This negatively impacts their economic viability, causing hardships on the families/spouses that care for them. As a result, divorce rates are high, with abandonment by husbands found in 25% of acid assault cases in [[Uganda]] (compared to only 3% of wives abandoning their disfigured husbands).&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; Moreover, acid survivors who are single when attacked almost certainly become [[social rejection|ostracized]] from society, effectively ruining marriage prospects.&lt;ref name=2a /&gt; Some media outlets overwhelmingly avoid reporting acid attack violence, or the description of the attack is laconic or often implies that the act was inevitable or even justified.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Halim and Marian Meyers (2010), ''News Coverage of Violence Against Muslim Women: A View From the Arabian Gulf'', Communication, Culture &amp; Critique. Volume 3, Issue 1, pages 85–104, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment for burn victims remains inadequate in many [[developing nation]]s where incidence is high. Medical underfunding has resulted in very few [[burn center]]s available for victims in countries such as Uganda,&lt;ref name="10a" /&gt; Bangladesh,&lt;ref name="7a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faga|first=A.|author2=D. Scevolab|author3=M.G. Mezzettic|author4=S. Scevolaa|title=Sulphuric acid burned women in Bangladesh: A social and medical problem|journal=Burns|volume=26|issue=8|pages=701–709|doi=10.1016/S0305-4179(00)00049-8|date=20 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cambodia.&lt;ref name="11a" /&gt; For example, Uganda has one specialized [[burn center]] in the entire nation, which opened in 2003;&lt;ref name="10a" /&gt; likewise, Cambodia has only one burn facility for victims,&lt;ref name="11a" /&gt; and scholars estimate that only 30% of the Bangladeshi community has access to [[health care]].&lt;ref name="7a" /&gt;

In addition to inadequate medical capabilities, many acid assault victims fail to report to the [[police]] due to a lack of trust in the force, a sense of hopelessness due to the attackers' [[impunity]], and a fear of male brutality in dealing with their cases.&lt;ref name=2a /&gt; Most of the female victims suffer more because of police apathy in dealing with cases of harassment as safety issues as victims refused to register a police case despite being attacked thrice before meriting police aid after an acid attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2854918.ece A case of police apathy?], ''The Hindu'', February 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

These problems are exacerbated by a lack of knowledge of how to treat burns: many victims applied oil to the acid, rather than rinsing thoroughly and completely with water for 30 minutes or longer to [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralize]] the acid. Such [[home remedy|home remedies]] only serve to increase the severity of damage, as they do not counteract the acidity.&lt;ref name=5a /&gt;

==Prevention==
Research has prompted many solutions to the increasing incidence of acid attacks in the world. Many countries look to Bangladesh, whose rates of attack have been decreasing, as a model, following their lead in many legislative reforms.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; However, several reports highlighted the need for an increased, legal role of NGOs to offer rehabilitation support to acid survivors.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt; Additionally, nearly all research stressed the need for stricter [[regulation]] of acid sales to combat this social issue.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt;&lt;ref name=10a /&gt;&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

===Role of NGOs===
Many [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) have been formed in the areas with the highest occurrence of acid attacks to combat such attacks. Bangladesh has its [[Acid Survivors Foundation]], which offers acid victims [[legal]], [[medical]], [[rehabilitation counseling|counseling]], and monetary assistance in rebuilding their lives.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; Similar institutions exist in Uganda, which has its own Acid Survivors Foundation,&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; and in Cambodia which uses the help of [[Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity]].&lt;ref name=11a /&gt; NGOs provide rehabilitation services for survivors while acting as advocates for [[social reform]], hoping to increase support and awareness for acid assault.

In Bangladesh, the [[Acid Survivors Foundation]], Nairpokkho, [[Action Aid]], and the [[Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee]]'s Community Empowerment &amp; Strengthening Local Institutions Programme assist survivors.&lt;ref name=Anwary&gt;Anwar, Afroza, 'Acid Violence and Medical Care in Bangladesh: Women's Activism as Carework' in Mary K.

The organisation was founded in 2002 and now works with a network of six Acid Survivors Foundations in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Uganda that it has helped to form. Acid Survivors Trust International has helped to provide medical expertise and training to partners, raised valuable funds to support survivors of acid attacks and helped change laws. A key role for ASTI is to raise awareness of acid violence to an international audience so that increased pressure can be applied to governments to introduce stricter controls on the sale and purchase of acid.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acidviolence.org/index.php/acid-violence/|title=Acid Violence|author=Whitespace Design|website=Acidviolence.org|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian acid attack survivor Shirin Juwaley founded the Palash Foundation&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palashfoundation.org/index.html |title=Home |publisher=Palash Foundation |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220201559/http://www.palashfoundation.org/index.html |archive-date=2014-02-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to help other survivors with psychosocial rehabilitation.

===Regulation of acid sales===
A positive correlation has been observed between acid attacks and ease of acid purchase.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; [[sulfuric acid|Sulfuric]], [[nitric acid|nitric]], and [[hydrochloric acid]] are most commonly used and are all cheap and readily available in many instances. For example, often acid throwers can purchase a liter of concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] at motorbike mechanic shops for about 40 U.S. cents. [[Nitric acid]] costs around $1.50 per liter and is available for purchase at gold or jewelry shops, as polishers generally use it to purify gold and metals. [[Hydrochloric acid]] is also used for polishing jewelry, as well as for making [[soy sauce]], [[cosmetics]], and traditional medicine/[[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] drugs.&lt;ref name=13a /&gt;

Due to such ease of access, many organizations call for a stricter regulation on the acid economy. Specific actions include required [[license]]s for all acid traders, a ban on concentrated acid in certain areas, and an enhanced system of monitoring for acid sales, such as the need to document all transactions involving acid.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt; However, some scholars have warned that such stringent regulation may result in [[black market]] trading of acid, which law enforcements must keep in mind.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt;


==History==
Acid has been used in [[metallurgy]] and for etching since ancient times. The rhetorical and theatrical term "La Vitrioleuse" was coined in France after a "wave of vitriolage" occurred according to the popular press where, in 1879, 16 cases of vitriol attacks were widely reported as [[Crime of passion|crimes of passion]] perpetrated predominantly by women against other women.&lt;ref name=13a/&gt; Much was made of the idea that women, no matter how few, had employed such violent means to an end. On October 17, 1915, acid was fatally thrown on [[Prince Leopold Clement of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], heir to the [[House of Koháry]], by his distraught mistress, [[Camilla Rybicka]], who then [[Murder–suicide|killed herself]]. Sensationalizing such incidents made for lucrative newspaper sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TC19160107.2.10|title=Royal Love Tragedy|work=[[The Colonist]]|publisher=Papers Past, [[National Library of New Zealand]]|date=1916-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of acid as a weapon began to rise in many [[developing country|developing nations]], specifically those in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name=7a /&gt; The first recorded acid attacks in South Asia occurred in Bangladesh in 1967,&lt;ref name=12a&gt;{{cite web |title=Combating Acid Violence In Bangladesh, India, and Cambodia |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/cedaw_crc_contributions/AvonGlobalCenterforWomenandJustice.pdf|publisher=Avon Foundation for Women|accessdate=6 March 2013|authors=Avon Global Center for Women and Justice at Cornell Law School, Committee on International Human Rights of the New York City bar Association, Cornell Law School international Human Rights Clinic, and the Virtue Foundation|pages=1–64|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; India in 1982, and Cambodia in 1993.&lt;ref name=13a/&gt; Since then, research has witnessed an increase in the quantity and severity of acid attacks in the region. However, this can be traced to significant underreporting in the 1980s and 1990s, along with a general lack of research on this phenomenon during that period.&lt;ref name=2a&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseline Report: Violence Against Women in Bangladesh |url=http://www.iwraw-ap.org/aboutus/pdf/FPvaw.pdf |publisher=International Women's Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific |accessdate=6 March 2013 |author=Naripokkho |author2=Bangladesh Mahila Parishad |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922173913/http://www.iwraw-ap.org/aboutus/pdf/FPvaw.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows acid attacks increasing in many [[developing country|developing nations]], with the exception of Bangladesh which has observed a decrease in incidence in the past few years.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

==Legislations==
Many countries have begun pushing for [[legislation]] addressing acid attacks, and a few have recently employed new [[law]]s against this crime.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; Under the [[Qisas]] law of Pakistan, the perpetrator may suffer the same fate as the victim, and may be punished by having drops of acid placed in their eyes.&lt;ref name="quisas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1908/context/archive|title=Pakistan's Acid-Attack Victims Press for Justice|accessdate=2008-05-30|publisher=Women's eNews|date=July 13, 2004|author=Juliette Terzieff|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612174357/http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1908/context/archive|archivedate=2008-06-12|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law is not binding and is rarely enforced according to a ''New York Times'' report.&lt;ref name="video.nytimes.com"/&gt; In Pakistan, the Lower House of [[parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] unanimously passed the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Bill on May 10, 2011. As punishment, according to the bill individuals held responsible for acid attacks face harsh fines and [[life in prison]]. However, the country with the most specific, effective legislation against acid attacks is Bangladesh, and such legal action has resulted in a steady 20–30% decrease in acid violence for the past few years.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; In 2013, India introduced an amendment to the [[Indian Penal Code]] through the [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013]], making acid attacks a specific offence with a punishment of imprisonment not less than 10 years and which can extend to life imprisonment and with fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 |url=http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf |publisher=Government of India |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417194151/http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
India's top court ruled that authorities must regulate the sale of acid. The Supreme Court's ruling on July 16, 2013, came after an incident in which four sisters suffered severe burns after being attacked with acid by two men on a motorbike. Acid which is designed to clean rusted tools is often used in the attacks can be bought across the counter. But the judges said the buyer of such acids should in future have to provide a photo identity card to any retailer when they make a purchase. The retailers must register the name and address of the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India's top court moves to curb acid attacks|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/07/2013718134222947132.html|work=[[Al Jazeera English]]|date=2013-07-18|accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Section 326 A of the Indian Penal Code|section 326 A]] of [[Indian Penal Code]] was enacted by the Indian Parliament to ensure enhanced punishment for acid throwing.

===Bangladesh===
In 2002, Bangladesh introduced the [[death penalty]] for acid attacks and laws strictly controlling the sale, use, storage, and [[international trade]] of acids. The acids are used in traditional trades carving marble nameplates, [[conch]] bangles, goldsmiths, tanneries, and other industries, which have largely failed to comply with the legislation. Salma Ali of the [[Bangladesh National Women Lawyers' Association]] derided these laws as ineffective.&lt;ref name="Bangladesh laws"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/south_asia/5133410.stm|title=Bangladesh's acid attack problem|accessdate=2008-06-14|publisher=BBC News|date=28 July 2006|author=Roland Buerk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of these laws are the Acid Crime Control Act (ACCA) and the Acid Control Act (ACA), respectively.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

The ACCA directly impacts the [[criminal law|criminal]] aspect of acid attacks, and allows for the death penalty or a level of punishment corresponding to the area of the body affected. If the attack results in a [[Deafness|loss of hearing]] or [[Loss of sight|sight]] or damages the victim's [[face]], [[breast]]s, or [[sex organ]]s then the perpetrator faces either the death penalty or [[life imprisonment|life sentencing]]. If any other part of the body is maimed, then the criminal faces 7–14 years of [[imprisonment]] in addition to a fine of US$700. Additionally, throwing or attempting to throw acid without causing any physical or mental harm is punishable by this law and could result in a prison term of 3–7 years along with a US$700 fine. Furthermore, [[conspiracy (crime)|conspirators]] that aid in such attacks assume the same [[legal liability|liability]] as those actually committing the crime.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

The ACA regulates the sale, usage, and storing of acid in Bangladesh through the creation of the National Acid Control Council (NACC). The law requires that the NACC implement policies regarding the trade, misuse, and disposal of acid, while also undertaking initiatives that raise awareness about the dangers of acid and improve victim treatment and rehabilitation. The ACA calls for district-level committees responsible for enacting local measures that enforce and further regulate acid use in towns and cities.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

===Pakistan===

After a spate of attacks in London in 2017, the [[Home Office]] said it would consider changes in laws and measures regarding sales of acid, as well as changes in prosecution and sentencing guidelines. As of 2017, it is unlawful to carry acid with the intent to cause harm. Attacks are prosecuted as acts of [[actual bodily harm]] and [[grievous bodily harm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40621303|work=BBC News|title=Acid attack punishments assessed in government review|date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/acid-attacks-uk-london-sale-law-change-theresa-may-latest-news-abh-gbh-a7840776.html|title=Theresa May hints at changing law after 'horrific' acid attacks in London|date=14 July 2017|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three quarters of police investigations do not end in prosecution, either because the attacker could not be found, or because the victim is unwilling to press charges.&lt;ref name=telegraph_policestats /&gt; According to ASTI, of the 2,078 acid attack crimes recorded for the years 2011-2016 in UK, only 414 of those crimes resulted in charges being brought.

'''Vitriolage''' is the deliberate splashing of a person or object with acid, also known as [[vitriol]], in order to deface or kill. A female who engages in such an act is known as a '''vitrioleuse'''. There are instances of this act throughout history and in modern times, often in places where [[honor killings]] are also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vday.org/contents/violence/glossary/acidattacks |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072005/http://www.vday.org/contents/violence/glossary/acidattacks |archive-date=2008-07-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1984">The '''Alexander Funeral Home''' is the oldest African American owned business in [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina]].

Alexander Funeral Home was founded by Zechariah Alexander in 1914 when Alexander bought half of Coles and Smith Undertakes. In 1927 Alexander purchased the remaining part of the business and changed the name to the Alexander Funeral Home. The business passed through the family with [[Kelly Alexander Sr]] and Zechariah Alexander Jr both making careers out of the business.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexanderfunerals.com/home/index.cfm/aboutus/history/fh_id/14043|title=Our Story|website=Alexander Funeral Home|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The funeral home became a sort of gathering place for civil rights activists and leaders in the community. [[Frederick D Alexander|Frederick Alexander]] became the first African American on the Charlotte City Council, [[Kelly Alexander Sr]] served as Chairman of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], Louis Alexander worked with the [[United States Postal Service]] and [[Kelly Alexander|Kelly Alexander Jr]] became a North Carolina Senator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Today the business is locally owned with members of the Alexander family overseeing the running of the company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1692">Generically, an '''alternative set theory''' is an alternative mathematical approach to the concept of '''[[Set (mathematics)|set]]'''. It is a proposed alternative to the [[axiomatic set theory|standard set theory]]. 

Some of the alternative set theories are:

*the theory of [[semiset]]s
*the set theory [[New Foundations]]
*[[Positive set theory]]
*[[Internal set theory]]

Specifically, '''Alternative Set Theory''' (or '''AST''') refers to a particular set theory developed in the 1970s and 1980s by [[Petr Vopěnka]] and his students. It builds on some ideas of the theory of [[semiset]]s, but also introduces more radical changes: for example, all sets are "formally" [[finite set|finite]], which means that sets in AST satisfy the law of [[mathematical induction]] for set-[[Formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] (more precisely: the part of AST that consists of [[axioms]] related to sets only is equivalent to the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel]] (or ZF) set theory, in which the [[axiom of infinity]] is replaced by its negation). However, some of these sets contain subclasses that are not sets, which makes them different from [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] (ZF) finite sets and they are called infinite in AST.

An '''anti-war movement''' (also ''antiwar'') is a [[social movement]], usually in opposition to a particular nation's decision to start or carry on an armed conflict, unconditional of a maybe-existing [[casus belli|just cause]]. The term can also refer to [[pacifism]], which is the opposition to all use of military force during conflicts. Many activists distinguish between anti-war movements and [[peace movement]]s. Anti-war activists work through protest and other [[grassroots]] means to attempt to pressure a government (or governments) to put an end to a particular war or conflict.

==History of modern movements==
===American Revolutionary War===
Substantial opposition to British war intervention in America led the British House of Commons on 27 February 1782 to [[American Revolutionary War#North Ministry collapses|vote against further war in America]], paving the way for the [[Second Rockingham ministry]] and the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]].

===Antebellum Era United States===

Substantial anti-war sentiment developed in the United States during the period roughly falling between the end of the [[War of 1812]] and the commencement of the Civil War, or what is called the [[Antebellum Era in the United States|antebellum]] era (A similar movement developed in England during the same period). The movement reflected both strict [[pacifism|pacifist]] and more moderate [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] positions.  Many prominent intellectuals of the time, including [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]] (''see'' ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'') and [[William Ellery Channing]] contributed literary works against war.  Other names associated with the movement include [[William Ladd]], [[Noah Worcester]], [[Thomas Cogswell Upham]] and [[Asa Mahan]]. Many peace societies were formed throughout the United States, the most prominent of which being the [[American Peace Society]].  Numerous periodicals (e.g., The Advocate of Peace) and books were also produced.  The ''Book of Peace'', an anthology produced by the American Peace Society in 1845, must surely rank as one of the most remarkable works of anti-war literature ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, George (ed), ''[https://archive.org/details/bookofpeacecolle00amerrich  The Book of Peace]''. American Peace Society, 1845.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recurring theme in this movement was the call for the establishment of an international court which would adjudicate disputes between nations.  Another distinct feature of antebellum anti-war literature was the emphasis on how war contributed to a moral decline and brutalization of society in general.

===American Civil War===
[[File:New York Draft Riots - fighting.jpg|thumb|200px|Rioters attack federal troops.]]
{{Further|Opposition to the American Civil War}}

A key event in the early history of the modern anti-war stance in [[literature]] and [[society]] was the [[American Civil War]], where it culminated in the candidacy of [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] for [[President of the United States]] as a "Peace Democrat" against incumbent President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. The outlines of the anti-war stance are seen: the argument that the costs of maintaining the present conflict are not worth the gains which can be made, the appeal to end the horrors of war, and the argument that war is being waged for the profit of particular interests. During the war, the [[New York Draft Riots]] were started as violent protests against [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s ''Enrollment Act of [[Conscription]]'' plan to draft men to fight in the war. The outrage over conscription was augmented by the ability to "buy" your way out; the amount of which could only be afforded by the wealthy. After the war, ''[[The Red Badge of Courage]]'' described the chaos and sense of death which resulted from the changing style of combat: away from the set engagement, and towards two armies engaging in continuous battle over a wide area.

===Second Boer War===
{{Further|Opposition to the Second Boer War}}

[[William Thomas Stead]] formed an organization against the [[Second Boer War]]: the [[Stop the War Committee]].

===World War I===
[[File:The Deserter.jpg|alt=|thumb|''The Deserter'' by [[Boardman Robinson]], ''[[The Masses]]'', 1916.]]
{{Further|Opposition to World War I}}
In Britain, in 1914, the [[Public Schools Act 1868|Public Schools]] [[Officers' Training Corps]] annual camp was held at [[Tidworth Pennings]], near [[Salisbury Plain]]. Head of the British Army [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] was to review the [[cadet]]s, but the immenence of the war prevented him. General [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]] was sent instead. He surprised the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] cadet who was present) ''that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust-probably not more than one-quarter of us – learned how right the General's prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.'' &lt;ref&gt;''Merely For the Record: The Memoirs of Donald Christopher Smith 1894–1980''. By Donald Christopher Smith. Edited by John William Cox, Jr. Bermuda.&lt;/ref&gt; Having voiced these sentiments did not hinder Smith-Dorrien's career, or prevent him from carrying out his duty in the First World War to the best of his abilities.

With the increasing mechanization of war, opposition to its horrors grew, particularly in the wake of the First World War. European [[avant-garde]] cultural movements such as [[Dada]] were explicitly anti-war.

The [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and the [[Sedition Act of 1918]] gave the American authorities the right to close newspapers and jailed individuals for having anti-war views.

On June 16, 1918, [[Eugene V. Debs]] made an anti-war speech and was arrested under the Espionage Act of 1917. He was convicted, sentenced to serve ten years in prison, but President [[Warren G. Harding]] commuted his sentence on December 25, 1921.

===Between the World Wars===
In 1924 Ernst Friedrich published ''Krieg dem Krieg!'' (''War Against War!''): an album of photographs drawn from German military and medical archives from the first world war. In ''[[Regarding the pain of others]]'' [[Susan Sontag|Sontag]] describes the book as 'photography as shock therapy' that was designed to 'horrify and demoralize'.

It was in the 1930s that the Western anti-war movement took shape, to which the political and organizational roots of most of the existing movement can be traced.  Characteristics of the anti-war movement included opposition to the corporate interests perceived as benefiting from war, to the [[status quo]] which was trading the lives of the young for the comforts of those who are older, the concept that those who were drafted were from poor families and would be fighting a war in place of privileged individuals who were able to avoid the draft and military service, and to the lack of input in decision making that those who would die in the conflict would have in deciding to engage in it.

In 1933, the [[Oxford Union]] resolved in its [[The King and Country debate|Oxford Pledge]], "That this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country."

Many war [[veteran]]s, including US General [[Smedley Butler]], spoke out against wars and war profiteering on their return to civilian life.

Veterans were still extremely cynical about the [[War#Theories for motivation|motivations]] for entering World War I, but many were willing to fight later in the [[Spanish Civil War]], indicating that [[pacifism]] was not always the motivation. These trends were depicted in novels such as ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' and ''[[Johnny Got His Gun]]''.

===World War II===
[[Image:WHProtest1941.jpg|thumbnail|right|Protest at the White House by the [[American Peace Mobilization]].]]
{{Further|Opposition to World War II}}
Opposition to [[World War II]] was most vocal during its early period, and stronger still before it started while [[appeasement]] and [[isolationism]] were considered viable diplomatic options.  Communist-led organizations, including veterans of the Spanish Civil War,&lt;ref name="ALBA-vol_1941_02b"&gt;
[http://www.alba-valb.org/volpdf/vol_1941_02b.pdf Volunteer for Liberty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206011824/http://www.alba-valb.org/volpdf/vol_1941_02b.pdf |date=2006-12-06 }}, newsletter of the ''[[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]]'', February 1941, Volume III, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; opposed the war during the period of the [[Hitler-Stalin pact]] but then turned into hawks after Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]].

The war seemed, for a time, to set anti-war movements at a distinct social disadvantage; very few, mostly ardent [[pacifism|pacifists]], continued to argue against the war and its results at the time. However, the [[Cold War]] followed with the [[Western betrayal|post-war realignment]], and the opposition resumed.  The grim realities of modern combat, and the nature of mechanized society ensured that the anti-war viewpoint found presentation in ''[[Catch-22]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' and ''[[The Tin Drum]]''. This sentiment grew in strength as the Cold War seemed to present the situation of an unending series of conflicts, which were fought at terrible cost to the younger generations.

===Vietnam War===
{{Further|Opposition to the Vietnam War}}
[[File:Washington D.C. Anti-Vietnam Demonstration. U.S. Marshals bodily remove one of the protesters during the outbreak of... - NARA - 530620.tif|thumb|left|220px|U.S. Marshals arresting a Vietnam War protester in Washington, D.C., 1967]]
Organized opposition to U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] began slowly and in small numbers in 1964 on various college campuses in the United States and quickly as the war grew deadlier. In 1967 a coalition of antiwar activists formed the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]] which organized several large anti-war demonstrations between the late-1960s and 1972. Counter-cultural songs, organizations, plays and other literary works encouraged a spirit of nonconformism, peace, and anti-establishmentarianism. This anti-war sentiment developed during a time of unprecedented [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|student activism]] and right on the heels of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and was reinforced in numbers by the demographically significant [[baby boomers]]. It quickly grew to include a wide and varied cross-section of Americans from all walks of life. The anti-Vietnam war movement is often considered to have been a major factor affecting America's involvement in the war itself. Many [[Vietnam veteran]]s, including the former [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and former U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]] and disabled veteran [[Ron Kovic]], spoke out against the Vietnam War on their return to the United States.

===South African Border War===
{{Main|South African resistance to war}}
Opposition to the [[South African Border War]] spread to a general resistance to the [[apartheid]] military. Organizations such as the [[End Conscription Campaign]] and Committee on South African War Resisters, were set up.  Many opposed the war at this time.

===2001 Afghanistan War===
[[File:June 22, 2007 protest in Quebec City against Canada's involvement in the Afghan war.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in [[Québec City]] against the Canadian military involvement in [[Afghanistan]], 22 June 2007]]
{{Further|Opposition to the 2001 Afghanistan War}}
There was initially little opposition to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 Afghanistan War]] in the United States and the [[United Kingdom]], which was seen as a response to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]] and was supported by a majority of the American public. Most vocal opposition came from pacifist groups and groups promoting a leftist political agenda; in the United States, the group [[A.N.S.W.E.R.]] was one of the most visible organizers of anti-war protests, although that group faced considerable controversy over allegations it was a front for the extremist Stalinist [[Workers World Party]]. Over time, opposition to the war in Afghanistan has grown more widespread, partly as a result of weariness with the length of the conflict, and partly as a result of a conflating of the conflict with the unpopular war in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/10/28/cnn-poll-support-for-afghanistan-war-at-all-time-low/|title=CNN Poll: Support for Afghanistan war at all time low|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq War===
{{Further|Opposition to the Iraq War}}

[[Image:Day119fwhitehouseb.JPG|thumb|[[Thomas (activist)|Thomas]] on the [[White House Peace Vigil]]]]
The anti-war position gained renewed support and attention in the buildup to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by the U.S. and its allies.  Millions of people staged [[Protests against the Iraq War|mass protests]] across the world in the immediate prelude to the invasion, and demonstrations and other forms of anti-war [[activism]] have continued throughout the occupation. The primary opposition within the U.S. to the continued occupation of Iraq has come from the [[grassroots]].  [[Opposition to the Iraq War|Opposition to the conflict]], how it had been fought, and complications during the aftermath period divided public sentiment in the U.S., resulting in majority public opinion turning against the war for the first time in the spring of 2004, a turn which has held since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm|title=Iraq|work=pollingreport.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many American writers against the war, like [[Naomi Wolf]], were labeled conspiratorial due to their opposition, with others choosing to post their anti-war writings anonymously, such as the anonymous conspiracy author Sorcha Faal. The financial website [[Zero Hedge]] offered its anti-war writers the protection of the anonymous pseudonym [[Fight Club (novel)#Tyler Durden|Tyler Durden]] for those exposing war profiteering.  The American country music band [[Dixie Chicks]] opposition to the war caused many radio stations to stop playing their records, but who were supported in their anti-war stance by the equally anti-war country music legend [[Merle Haggard]], who in the summer of 2003 released a song critical of US media coverage of the Iraq War. Anti-war groups protested during both the Democratic National Convention and [[2008 Republican National Convention#Protests|2008 Republican National Convention protests]] held in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], [[Minnesota]] in September 2008.

==Arts and culture==
{{See also|List of books with anti-war themes}}
&lt;!-- HELP!  please add some examples from outside the English-speaking world! --&gt;

[[England|English]] poet [[Robert Southey]]'s 1796 poem [[After Blenheim]] is an early modern example of anti-war literature — it was written generations after the [[Battle of Blenheim]], but at a time when England was again at war with France.

[[World War I]] produced a generation of poets and writers influenced by their experiences in the war. The work of poets including [[Wilfred Owen]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]] exposed the contrast between the realities of life in the trenches and how the war was seen by the British public at the time, as well as the earlier patriotic verse penned by [[Rupert Brooke]]. German writer [[Erich Maria Remarque]] penned All Quiet on the Western Front, which, having been adapted for several mediums, has become of the most often cited pieces of anti-war media.

[[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1937 painting ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'', on the other hand, used abstraction rather than realism to generate an emotional response to the loss of life from the [[fascism|fascist]] [[bombing of Guernica]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].  American author [[Kurt Vonnegut]] used science fiction themes in his 1969 novel [[Slaughterhouse-Five]], depicting the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II]] (which Vonnegut witnessed).

The second half of the 20th century also witnessed a strong anti-war presence in other art forms, including anti-war music such as "[[Eve of Destruction (song)|Eve of Destruction]]" and [[One Tin Soldier]] and films such as ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]'' and ''[[Die Brücke (film)|Die Brücke]]'', opposing the [[Cold War]] in general, or specific conflicts such as the [[Vietnam War]].  The current American war in [[Iraq]] has also generated significant artistic anti-war works, including filmmaker [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', which holds the box-office record for documentary films, and [[Canada|Canadian]] musician [[Neil Young]]'s 2006 album ''[[Living with War]]''.

==Anti-war intellectual and scientist-activists and their work==
Various people have discussed the philosophical question of whether war is inevitable, and how much it can be avoided, as well as how this can be achieved i.e. what are the necessities of peace. Various people have discussed it from an intellectual and philosophical point of view. Various intellectuals not only have discussed in public but have participated or led anti-war campaigns despite it is different to their main areas of expertise. They went out of their professional comfort zone to warn against or fight against wars.

===Philosophical possibility of avoiding war===
* [[Immanuel Kant]]: In (1795) "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|Perpetual Peace]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm|title=Immanuel Kant, "Perpetual Peace"|publisher=Mtholyoke.edu|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant. Perpetual Peace. English translation. Jonathan Bennett. 2010–2015 [http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/kant1795_1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ("''Zum ewigen Frieden''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb5/frieden/themen/Theorie/kant.html|title=Immanuel Kant: Zum ewigen Frieden, 12.02.2004 (Friedensratschlag)|publisher=Uni-kassel.de|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] booklet on "Perpetual Peace" in 1795. Politically, Kant was one of the earliest exponents of the idea that perpetual peace could be secured through universal democracy and international cooperation. &lt;!-- from wikipedia --&gt;
* [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] suggests, war can never be ruled out, as one can never know when or if one will occur. However, A peaceful revolution is also possible according to Hegel when the changes required to solve the crisis are ascertained by thoughtful insight and when this insight spreads throughout the body politic. (See [[Hegelianism]]) Some people claim that Hegel glorified war, this is disputed heavily. This claim has always been based on interpretations only. Hegel's views are often mistaken with the characters of his books, who are the subjects in history.&lt;ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Arlene Raven's parents were Joseph and Annette Rubin, middle-class Jewish-American parents, in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;ref name="legacy.com"&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/baltimoresun/obituary.aspx?pid=172164204] Joseph Rubin Obituary, Baltimore Sun, 20 August 2014.

[[Bahá’u’lláh]], the prophet-founder of the [[Bahá’í Faith]], called for global agreement on human rights protection nearly eighty years before the adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)]] in 1948. He taught that an “equal standard of human rights must be recognized and adopted.”&lt;ref&gt;Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace,  US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1982 second edition, at 182.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bahá’u’lláh called for governments to protect the human rights of their populations and to ensure their welfare. To safeguard human rights, He urged global leaders to establish a world commonwealth that would include a system of collective security to protect populations against tyranny and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lepard, “A Baha’i Perspective on International Human Rights Law”, University of Bebraska, Juxta Publishing 2012, at 3. http://bahai-library.com/pdf/l/lepard_bahai_perspective_rights.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divine basis for human rights==
The Bahá’í Writings make clear that human rights are not merely a political or social concept that is contingent on recognition by governments. Rather, the Bahá’í perspective is that human rights exist with or without governments; indeed, they are a divine endowment flowing from the creation of all human beings with the potential to reflect the attributes of God. All human beings have for this reason an equal spiritual dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lepard, “A Baha’i Perspective on International Human Rights Law”, University of Bebraska, Juxta Publishing 2012, at 10. http://bahai-library.com/pdf/l/lepard_bahai_perspective_rights.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, governments have a moral obligation to respect this divine endowment, an obligation that would exist even in the absence of treaties or customary legal norms obligating them to do so.  Bahá’u’lláh impressed upon rulers this sacred duty: “For is it not your clear duty to restrain the tyranny of the oppressor, and to deal equitably with your subjects, that your high sense of justice may be fully demonstrated to all mankind? God hath committed into your hands the reins of the government of the people, that ye may rule with justice over them, safeguard the rights of the down-trodden, and punish the wrong-doers.”&lt;ref&gt;Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings From the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, at 247.&lt;/ref&gt; These are divinely-ordained responsibilities that no government can legitimately shirk.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lepard, “A Baha’i Perspective on International Human Rights Law”, University of Bebraska, Juxta Publishing 2012, at 10. http://bahai-library.com/pdf/l/lepard_bahai_perspective_rights.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bahá’u’lláh also teaches that because of this equal spiritual dignity, all human beings are members of a single human family that should be unified. This means that all should treat one another as brothers and sisters, and in turn honor and respect the rights of all other human beings, not only as co-equals, but as spiritual relatives. He declares, “Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch.”&lt;ref&gt;Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings From the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, at 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of this fundamental connectedness is a precondition, according to the Bahá’í teachings, for the full realization of human rights. Bahá’u’lláh asserts in this connection: “The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established.”&lt;ref&gt;Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings From the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, at 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights will remain no more than a morally 
admirable concept so long as they are not anchored in such an appreciation for human unity. That unity provides the impetus, the motivation, the will, to uphold and defend the rights of others. And it implies that human rights are the concern of everyone, not just governments.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lepard, “A Baha’i Perspective on International Human Rights Law”, University of Bebraska, Juxta Publishing 2012, at 10. http://bahai-library.com/pdf/l/lepard_bahai_perspective_rights.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The earliest use of the terminology of human rights in publications by Bahá’í institutions coincided with the inception of their official relationship with the [[United Nations]]. Three of the first four documents submitted to the newly established international organization in 1947 and 1948 were statements on various aspects of human rights intended as contributions to the preparatory work on the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]]. The first of these was an eight-page statement entitled “A Bahá’í Declaration of Human Obligations and Rights”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bic.org/statements/bahai-declaration-human-obligations-and-rights.&lt;/ref&gt; which was presented to the Human Rights Commission&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrc.co.nz&lt;/ref&gt; in February 1947 on behalf of eight national Bahá’í administrative bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Albert Lincoln, "Bahá’í-Inspired Perspectives on Human Rights", at 7.http://juxta.com/wp-content/uploads/humanrights-electronic-1.2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Bahá'í International Community|Bahá’í International Community (BIC)]] explains that concern for human rights can be found throughout the Bahá’í Writings. [[Bahá’u’lláh]], urged the rulers of the earth to “rule with justice ... safeguard the rights of the down-trodden, and punish the wrong-doers.”&lt;ref&gt;Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings From the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, at 247.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught that “there shall be an equality of rights and prerogatives for all mankind.”&lt;ref&gt;Abdu’l-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace,  US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1982 second edition, at 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shoghi Effendi]], the authorized interpreter of Baha’u’llah’s teachings, states that:
“[t]he unity of the human race, as envisaged by Bahá’u’lláh, implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which .... the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples.”&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi, The World Order Bahá’u’lláh, US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1991 first pocket-size edition, at 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in ''[[The Promise of World Peace]]'', the [[Universal House of Justice]] (the supreme governing institution of the Faith) underscores the importance of the UDHR and its related conventions, asserting that “all such measures, if courageously enforced and expanded, will advance the day when the specter of war will have lost its power to dominate international relations.”&lt;ref&gt;The Universal House of Justice, [[The Promise of World Peace]]. http://bahai.uga.edu/peace.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá’í views on human rights are based on the concept that every person is essentially a spiritual being endowed by the Creator with talents and capacities, and that the purpose of life is to realize that potential for the benefit of society as well as the individual concerned. The equal dignity of all human beings and the need for both solidarity and legal equality among them are clearly posited in many passages of the Bahá’í sacred scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Albert Lincoln, "Bahá’í-Inspired Perspectives on Human Rights", at 7. http://juxta.com/wp-content/uploads/humanrights-electronic-1.2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are encapsulated in the concept of the “oneness of mankind”, which is described as the “pivot round which all the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh revolve”.&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi, The World Order Bahá’u’lláh, US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1991 first pocket-size edition, at 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustrations of contributions to human rights issues by the Bahá’í community==
The Bahá’í community plays an active role in enhancing a culture of human rights. Scores of statements on various aspects of human rights have been released since the presentation of “A Bahá’í Declaration of Human Obligations and Rights” in 1947. The Bahá’í community is dedicated to the integration of human rights in every aspect of global community life and favours education as the main approach to the promotion and protection of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;"Bahá’í-Inspired Perspectives on Human Rights", at 11. http://juxta.com/wp-content/uploads/humanrights-electronic-1.2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender equality===
Gender equality is a fundamental principle of the [[Bahá’í Faith]]. Baha’i belief states that [[Bahá'í Faith and gender equality|the equality of the sexes]] is a spiritual and moral standard that is essential for the unification of the planet and the unfoldment of peace. The Bahá'í teachings note the importance of implementing the principle in individual, family, and community life. 
The [[Bahá'í International Community|BIC]] has released various statements on gender equality and particularly the role of women. In 1947, a statement entitled “Elimination of Discrimination Against women”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bic.org/statements/elimination-discrimination-against-women&lt;/ref&gt; was presented to the 25th session of [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] on the Status of Women. As part of the statement, the [[Bahá'í International Community|BIC]] emphasized that the Baha'i Writings stress the principle of equality of education for men and women, as well as that of compulsory universal education, and elaborate the responsibilities of parents and of Bahá’í institutions to ensure equal opportunities in the education of children. In fact it is stated that if parents are not able to educate both boy and girl, the girl should be given preference because she is the future mother and first educator of the child.

For the [[International Women's Year]] in 1975, the [[Bahá'í International Community|BIC]] released a pamphlet &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bahai.org/documents/bic/equality-men-women-new-reality&lt;/ref&gt; entitled “Equality of Men and Woman: A New Reality” which stated that equality of the sexes is, for Bahá’ís, a spiritual and moral standard essential for the unification of the planet and the unfoldment of world order. Without the qualities, talents, and skills of both women and men, full economic and social development of the planet becomes impossible. For "[t]he world of humanity is possessed of two wings — the male and the female. So long as these two wings are not equivalent in strength the bird will not fly. Until womankind reaches the same degree as man, until she enjoys the same arena of activity, extraordinary attainment for humanity will not be realized; humanity cannot wing its way to heights of real attainment."&lt;ref&gt;Peace, Compiled by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, Bahá’í World Centre, August 1985 at page 40. http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/c/CP/cp-39.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eradicating poverty and rethinking prosperity===
In a statement in 2008 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bahai.org/documents/bic/eradicating-poverty.&lt;/ref&gt; entitled “Eradicating Poverty: Moving Forward as One”, the [[Bahá'í International Community|BIC]] offered two principles as guides for efforts in the realm of poverty eradication: justice and unity. They emphasised that these principles underlie a vision of development in which material progress serves as a vehicle for the moral and cultural advancement of humanity. Justice provides the means capable of harnessing human potential to eradicate poverty from our midst, through the implementation of laws, the adjustment of economic systems, the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, and unfailing adherence to the highest ethical standards in private and public life. Unity assures that progress is systemic and relational, that a concern for the integrity of the family unit and the local, national, and global community must guide poverty alleviation efforts.

Furthermore, in 2010 in their contribution to the 18th session of [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] on sustainable development, [[Bahá'í International Community|Bahá’í International Community (BIC)]] challenged the assumption that human beings are slaves to self-interest and consumerism. In the statement “Rethinking Prosperity: Forging Alternatives to a Culture of Consumerism”,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bahai.org/documents/bic/rethinking-prosperity&lt;/ref&gt; they state that the transition to [[sustainable consumption]] and production is part of a global enterprise which enables all individuals to fulfill their dual purpose, namely to develop their inherent potentialities and to contribute to the betterment of the wider community. It is not enough to conceive of sustainable consumption and production in terms of creating opportunities for those living in poverty to meet their basic needs. Rather, with the understanding that each individual has a contribution to make to the construction of a more just and peaceful social order, these processes must be arranged in a way that permits each to play his or her rightful role as a productive member of society. Within such a framework, sustainable consumption and production could be characterized as processes that provide for the material, social and spiritual needs of humanity across generations and enable all peoples to contribute to the ongoing advancement of society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5443">The '''Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit''', variously called '''Citizens Armed Forces Geographical Unit''', '''Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit''' and commonly referred to by its [[acronym]] '''CAFGU''' (pronounced "kahf-goo") is an [[Irregular military|irregular]] [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary]] force of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].

==Creation==
The CAFGU was created on July 25, 1987 when [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon C. Aquino]] signed Executive Order No. 264 entitled "Providing for the Citizen Armed Force".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Executive Order No. 264 | url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/index10.php?doctype=Executive%20Orders&amp;docid=a45475a11ec72b843d74959b60fd7bd646ccc97c654f7#sam | accessdate = 2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the unit was based on the "clear, consolidate, hold and develop" strategy adopted by then-Defense Secretary [[Fidel V. Ramos]] in dealing with insurgent-infiltrated villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Ilagan | first =Aris R. | title =Over 1,000 shotguns sent to Mindanao for civilian volunteers | pages = | publisher =[[Manila Bulletin]] Online | date = 2008-08-21 |url =http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/08/21/MAIN20080821133036.html | accessdate = 2008-12-27}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAFGU units are components of the AFP Ready Reserve detailed to Military Auxiliary Service. Article X, Sec. 61, sub-paragraph 2 of Republic Act 7077&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =ADROTH Project: Republic Act 7077, Article X - Utilization of the Reserve Force | url=http://adroth.ph/reservist/law/7077/art10.htm | accessdate = 2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes this manner of service as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Military auxiliary service entails services rendered in meeting local insurgency threat. Reservists serving under this category will be organized into Ready Reserve units. They must be issued and allowed to carry firearms: Provided, That these reservists will be utilized only for the defense of their respective localities and will not be employed outside their localities. Elected/appointed local government officials are expected to perform their duties and responsibilities in their respective peace and order council levels or similar organizations efficiently and effectively to enhance a total integrated system approach against threats to national security. The Secretary of National Defense shall prescribe the rules and regulations to implement this section in coordination with the Secretary of the Interior and Local Government.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Organization==
CAFGU units are administered by, and under the operational control of, regular units of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]]. Philippine Army infantry battalions assigned to this function are also referred to as "Cadre Battalions". Deactivation of CAFGU units assigned to these battalions result in the return of their status as regular infantry battalions.

The CAFGU units are tasked to prevent the re-infiltration of insurgents into communities that have already been cleared of their influence by combat operations conducted by regular units of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

The CAFGU units are issued [[small arms]]; typically [[M1 Garand]], [[M14 rifle|M-14]], or [[M16 rifle|M-16]] rifles, and receive a monthly stipend of [[Philippine peso|Php]] 2,700.00 (about US$57).

==Criticism==
In 1993, the Philippine government considered deactivating the CAFGU units due to allegations of [[human rights]] abuses; 60 CAFGU units comprising 10,000 troops were disbanded. However, in 1996, the government halted its program to completely disband the CAFGU units. As of 2007, an estimated 60,000 CAFGU troopers are active in the country, taking part in military operations alongside regular soldiers of the AFP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Reyes | first =Danilo | title =Policies arming civilians a product of vigilantism | url =http://www.eia.rghr.net/archive/2008-ethics-in-action/vol.-2-no.-5-october-2008/policies-arming-civilians-a-product-of-vigilantism | accessdate =2008-12-27 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090313121806/http://www.eia.rghr.net/archive/2008-ethics-in-action/vol.-2-no.-5-october-2008/policies-arming-civilians-a-product-of-vigilantism | archivedate =2009-03-13 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]]' records show that as of 2000, 853 human rights abuse cases have been filed against 1,070 CAFGU members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =On the Revival of the Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Units | url=http://www.chr.gov.ph/MAIN%20PAGES/about%20hr/advisories/pdf_files/abthr009.pdf | accessdate = 2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Classic of Filial Piety''''',&lt;!--Chinese in infobox; see WP:MOS-ZH--&gt; also known by its [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name as the '''''Xiaojing''''', is a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[Confucian classics|classic]] [[treatise]] giving advice on [[filial piety]]: that is, how to behave towards a senior such as a father, an elder brother, or ruler.

==Authorship==
This document probably dates to the 4th century BC. It is not known who actually wrote the document. It is attributed to a conversation between [[Confucius]] and his disciple [[Zengzi]]. A 12th-century author named He Yin claimed: "The ''Classic of Filial Piety'' was not made by Zengzi himself. When he retired from his conversation (or conversations) with Kung-ne on the subject of Filial Piety, he repeated to the disciples of his own school what (the master) had said, and they classified the sayings, and formed the treatise."

==Content==
As the title suggests, the text elaborates on filial piety, which is a core Confucian value. The text argues that if a person loves and serves their parents then they will do the same for their rulers, leading to a harmonious society. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Legge|first1=James|title=The Classic of Filial Piety 《孝經》|url=http://chinesenotes.com/xiaojing/xiaojing001.html|website=Chinese Notes|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|資於事父以事母，而愛同；資於事父以事君，而敬同
As they serve their fathers, so they serve their mothers, and they love them equally. As they serve their fathers, so they serve their rulers, and they reverence them equally.}}

The ''Classic of Filial Piety'' occupied an important position in classical education as one of the most popular foundational texts through to late imperial China.{{sfnp|Lu|2017|p=268}} The text was used in elementary and moral education together with the [[Analects]], Elementary Learning, and the [[Biographies of Exemplary Women]].{{sfnp|Lu|2017|p=272}} Study of the text was also mentioned in epitaphs as an indication of a person's good character. It was a practice to read aloud the text when mourning one's parents. The text was also important politically, partly because filial piety was both a means of demonstrating moral virtue and entering officialdom for those with family connections to the imperial court.{{sfnp|Lu|2017|pp=273-277}} The text was important in [[Neo-Confucianism]], being quoted by the influential Song figure [[Zhu Xi]].

{{UML diagram types}}
In [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), a '''component diagram''' depicts how [[component (UML)|components]] are wired together to form larger components or [[software system]]s.
They are used to illustrate the structure of arbitrarily complex systems.

== Overview ==
A component is something required to execute a stereotype function. Examples of stereotypes in components include executables, documents, database tables, files, and library files.
Components are wired together by using an ''assembly connector'' to connect the required [[interface (computing)|interface]] of one component with the provided interface of another component. This illustrates the ''service consumer - service provider'' relationship between the two components.

An ''assembly connector'' is a "connector between two components that defines that one component provides the services that another component requires. An assembly connector is a connector that is defined from a required interface or port to a provided interface or port."&lt;ref name="OMG V2.1.2"&gt;[http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.1.2/Superstructure/PDF OMG Unified Modeling Language (UML), Superstructure, V2.1.2], p.154.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using a component diagram to show the internal structure of a component, the provided and required interfaces of the encompassing component can delegate to the corresponding interfaces of the contained components.

A ''delegation connector'' is a "connector that links the external contract of a component (as specified by its ports) to the internal realization of that behavior by the component’s parts."&lt;ref name="OMG V2.1.2"/&gt;

The example above illustrates what a typical insurance policy administration system might look like. Each of the components depicted in the above diagram may have other component diagrams illustrating its internal structure.

==Arthurian Approach==
In the arthurian approach the system is analyzed from above not emphasizing any specific component. This approach allows for the usage of a smaller number of less detailed diagrams that still describe the system fairly accurately. It is very useful in the early stages of a project given that these diagrams are easier to change as the project develops and matures.

==Symbols==
A ''component'' is represented by a rectangle with either the keyword "component" or a stereotype in the top right corner: a small rectangle with two even smaller rectangles jutting out on the left.&lt;ref name="OMG V2.5"&gt;[http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.5/PDF OMG Unified Modeling Language (UML), V2.5], p.208.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lollipop, a small circle on a stick, represents an implemented or provided interface. The socket symbol is a semicircle on a stick that can fit around the lollipop. This socket is a [[dependency (UML)|dependency]] or needed interface.&lt;ref name="Ambler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/componentDiagram.htm|title=Introduction to UML 2 Component Diagrams|last=Ambler|first=Scott W.|accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4749">[[File:Bobo doll-en.svg|thumb|right|140px|An object's [[center of mass]] is certainly a real ''thing'', but it is a construct (not another ''object'')]] 
A '''construct''' in the [[philosophy of science]] is an ''ideal'' [[object (philosophy)|object]], where the existence of the thing may be said to depend upon a subject's [[mind]]. This contrasts with a ''real'' object, where existence does not seem to depend on the existence of a mind.&lt;ref&gt;Bunge, M. 1974. ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy, Vol. I Semantics I: Sense and Reference''. Dordrecth-Boston: Reidel Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[scientific theory]], particularly within psychology, a '''hypothetical construct''' is an explanatory variable which is not directly observable. For example, the concepts of ''intelligence'' and ''motivation'' are used to explain phenomena in [[psychology]], but neither is directly observable. A hypothetical construct differs from an [[intervening variable]] in that it has properties and implications which have not been demonstrated in empirical research. These serve as a guide to further research. An intervening variable, on the other hand, is a summary of observed empirical findings.

The creation of constructs is a part of [[operationalization]], especially the creation of [[theoretical definition]]s. The usefulness of one conceptualization over another depends largely on [[construct validity]]. To address the non-observability of constructs, U.S. federal agencies such as the [[National Institutes of Health]]  [[National Cancer Institute]] has created a construct database termed [[Grid-Enabled Measures]] (GEM) to improve construct use and reuse.

==Construct versus object==
Concepts that are considered ''constructs'' by this definition include that which is designated by the symbol "''3''" or the word "''[[liberty]]''".{{what|date=July 2016}} Scientific [[hypotheses]] and [[theories]] (e.g. [[evolutionary theory]], [[gravitational theory]]), as well as classifications (e.g. in biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]) are also conceptual entities considered to be ''constructs''.

Simple examples of real [[object (philosophy)|objects]] (that are not constructs) include [[silver fish (fish)|silver fish]] and [[undershirts]].

==History==
Cronbach and Meehl (1955) define a hypothetical construct as a [[concept]] for which there is not a single observable referent, which cannot be directly observed, and for which there exist multiple referents, but none all-inclusive. For example, according to Cronbach and Meehl a fish is not a hypothetical construct because, despite variation in species and varieties of fish, there is an agreed upon definition for a fish with specific characteristics that distinguish a fish from a bird. Furthermore, a fish can be directly observed. On the other hand, a hypothetical construct has no single referent; rather, hypothetical constructs consist of groups of functionally related behaviors, attitudes, processes, and experiences. Instead of seeing intelligence, love, or fear we see indicators or manifestations of what we have agreed to call intelligence, love, or fear.

[[File:Symptoms of leukemia.png|thumb|right|Diseases like Leukemia are important explanatory concepts, but do not 'exist' in the same way as a rock or a pencil]]
McCorquodale and Meehl (1948) discussed the distinction between what they called intervening variables and these hypothetical constructs. McCorquodale and Meehl (1948) describe hypothetical constructs as containing surplus meaning, as they imply more than just the operations by which they are measured.

In the positivist tradition, Boring (1923) described intelligence as whatever the intelligence test measures.  As a reaction to such [[operational definition]]s, Cronbach and Meehl (1955) emphasized the necessity of viewing constructs like intelligence as hypothetical constructs.  They asserted that there is no adequate criterion for the operational definition of constructs like abilities and personality.  Thus, according to Cronbach and Meehl (1955), a useful construct of intelligence or personality should imply more than simply test scores.  Instead these constructs should predict a wide range of behaviors.

Founded in 1954, CEF is a non profit US-American membership organization based in Buffalo (New York).

==History==
The organization was established in 1954 by the advertising specialist and creative professional [[Alex F. Osborn]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativeeducationfoundation.org/about-us/brief-history CEF website: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502053825/http://creativeeducationfoundation.org/about-us/brief-history |date=2013-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was known as the inventor of the term and the [[creativity technique]] of [[Brainstorming]]. As an early contribution according to its mission statement the organization held in 1955 the first annual Creative Problem Solving Institute (CPSI), an international creativity conference, at the [[University of Buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040903161948/http://www.buffalostate.edu/orgs/cbir/readingroom/html/Sharkey-Januale-99.html ICSC-website]&lt;/ref&gt;

For years the organization had been directed by Alex Osborn together with the creativity theorist and education researcher [[Sid Parnes]]. When Alex Osborn died in 1966, Parnes took over the initiative and the chair. He installed the lifetime creative achievement award which was granted upon suggestion to persons who earned outstanding merits in the field of applied creativity. Also he installed a media-program of CEF-publications.

In 1987 John Meyerhoff took over as the CEO. He expanded CEF’s educational perspective to include business training.

Further CEOs added partnership programs and VIP-days and reinstalled CEF consulting and training programs.

==Work==
In the beginning the focus relied on organizing the annual conference, evolving and applying creativity tools and techniques which can be used professionally and personally, conducting research in the field of applied creativity, problem solving and innovation, publishing books and teaching materials, and in the development of a comprehensive educational program which includes creativity specifically for scholars and young people.

As a part of its research aspirations, in 1967, the organization launched  the [[Journal of Creative Behavior| Journal of Creative Behavior (JCB)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2162-6057|title=The Journal of Creative Behavior|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|publisher=|doi=10.1002/(issn)2162-6057}}&lt;/ref&gt; a peer-reviewed first research publication devoted to the science of creativity, published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]]. Later, in 1972 it was followed by Creativity in Action, CEF’s monthly newsletter.

Since 1979 the CPSI-conference has offered four major program streams: Springboard for novices, Leadership Development Program, CPSI YouthWise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mycoted.com/Creative_Education_Foundation|title=Creative Education Foundation - Mycoted|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Extending sessions for exploratory studies.

Since 1989 the organization sponsored creativity conferences in the CPSI-sense on different continents promote creativity and creative education; it started with the first Australian CPSI &lt;!-- no specific date found yet--&gt; and was later followed by the South African ACRE-conference (since 1994) and the European CREA-conference (since 2003).

In 2003 the CEF YouthWise-program was launched in South Africa, and in 2011 the Creativity in the 21st Century Classroom course enhanced the CPSI program.

Today the goals of CEF span a range of fostering creativity and giftedness including dialogue, serious play and training programs, conferences, programs, publications and other services in order to pursue the idea of creativity as human capacity which can be developed and nurtured.&lt;ref name="creativeeducationfoundation.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeeducationfoundation.org/|title=Creative Education Foundation - Creating Innovative Thinkers.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The CPS Process==
Central to the Creative Education Foundation is their belief in the CPS Process. The steps are clarify, ideate, develop and implement; while the core principles include convergent and divergent thinking must be balanced, ask problems as questions, suspend judgement, and focus on "yes and..." rather than "no, but...". &lt;ref name="creativeeducationfoundation.org"/&gt;

==Research==
'''The Journal of Creative Behavior:'''
CEF publishes a quarterly academic citing research in creative thinking titled, ''"The Journal of Creative Behavior"''. Edited by  Ronald A. Beghetto  from the [[University of Connecticut]], the journal deals with methods to foster creative productivity, giftedness, management of creative personnel, testing, creativity in business and industry, development of creative curricula, creativity in the arts and sciences, and reviews of literature on creativity and problem solving. The content also focuses on the creative process. After self-publishing 45 volumes since 1967, the Journal of Creative Behavior moved to [[Wiley-Blackwell]], a commercial publisher of academic journals.&lt;ref name="creativeeducationfoundation.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Gender empowerment''' is the [[empowerment]] of people of any [[gender]]. While conventionally being reduced to its aspect of [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], the concept stresses [[Sex and gender distinction|the distinction]] between biological [[sex]] and [[Gender role|gender as a role]], also referring to other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context.

Gender empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in regard to development and economics. Entire nations, businesses, communities, and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;Deneulin, Séverine, with Lila Shahani.  2009.  An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency.  Sterling, VA: Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring ==
Gender empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]], or the GEM. The GEM shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. Gem is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence."&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt;

[[File:Map_of_the_Interior_World.png|thumb|upright=1.4|A cross-sectional drawing of the planet Earth showing the "Interior World" of Atvatabar, from [[William R. Bradshaw]]'s 1892 science-fiction novel ''The Goddess of Atvatabar'']]
The '''Hollow Earth''' is a historical concept proposing that the planet [[Earth]] is entirely hollow or contains a substantial interior space. 
Notably suggested by [[Edmond Halley]] in the late 17th century, the notion was tentatively disproven by [[Pierre Bouguer]] in 1740, and definitely by [[Charles Hutton]] (1778).

It was still occasionally defended in the early-to-mid 19th century, notably by [[John Cleves Symmes Jr.]] and [[Jeremiah N. Reynolds]], but by this time was part of popular [[pseudoscience]] and no longer a scientifically viable hypothesis.

The concept of a hollow Earth still recurs in [[folklore]] and as the premise for [[subterranean fiction]], and a subgenre of [[adventure fiction]] (''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', ''[[At the Earth's Core (novel)|At the Earth's Core]]'').

==Hypothesis==
&lt;!-- Reliable sources would be appreciated for much of this material. --&gt;

In ancient times, the concept of a subterranean land inside the Earth appeared in [[mythology]], [[folklore]] and [[legend]]s. The idea of subterranean realms seemed arguable, and became intertwined with the concept of "places" of origin or afterlife, such as the [[Greek underworld]], the [[Norse mythology|Nordic]] [[Svartálfaheimr]], the Christian [[Hell]], and the Jewish [[Sheol]] (with details describing inner Earth in [[Kabbalah|Kabalistic]] literature, such as the [[Zohar]] and [[Avraham Azulai|Hesed L'Avraham]]). The idea of a subterranean realm is also mentioned in [[Tibetan Buddhist]] belief.&lt;ref&gt;Hollow Earth in the Puranas [http://holloworbs.com/HE_Puranas_Article.htm Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Way to Shambhala, Edwin Bernbaum, Anchor Books; 1st edition, 1980 {{ISBN|0-385-12794-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one story from Tibetan Buddhist tradition, there is an ancient city called [[Shamballa]] which is located inside the Earth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

According to the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], there were [[caverns]] under the surface which were entrances leading to the [[underworld]], some of which were the caverns at [[Tainaron]] in [[Lakonia]], at [[Troezen]] in [[Argolis]], at Ephya in [[Thesprotia]], at Herakleia in [[Pontus (region)|Pontos]], and in [[Ermioni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | volume = 1 | year = 1916 | first = William | last = Sherwood Fox | authorlink = William Sherwood Fox | title = Greek and Roman | url = https://archive.org/details/mythologyofallra11gray_0 | page=  143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Thracians|Thracian]] and [[Dacians|Dacian]] legends, it is said that there are underground [[Environmental chamber|chambers]] occupied by an ancient god called [[Zalmoxis]].&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade, Zalmoxis, the vanishing God: comparative studies in the religions and folklore of Dacia and Eastern Europe, 1959, pp. 24–30&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mesopotamian religion]] there is a story of a man who, after traveling through the darkness of a tunnel in the mountain of "Mashu", entered a subterranean garden.&lt;ref&gt;Myth: its meaning and functions in ancient and other cultures, G.

The bell tower stands on a mound that is the site of a cave which, according to various myths, is an entrance to a place of [[purgatory]] inside the Earth. The cave has been closed since October 25, 1632.]]

In [[Celtic mythology]] there is a legend of a cave called "[[Cruachan, Ireland|Cruachan]]", also known as "Ireland's gate to Hell", a mythical and ancient cave from which according to legend strange creatures would emerge and be seen on the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;John A MacCulloch, Celtic Mythology, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Pub Inc, 1932, pp. 125–26&lt;/ref&gt; There are also stories of [[medieval]] [[knights]] and [[saints]] who went on [[pilgrimages]] to a cave located in [[Station Island]], [[County Donegal]] in Ireland, where they made journeys inside the Earth into a place of [[purgatory]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Write, Saint Patrick's Purgatory : A medieval Pilgrimage in Ireland, 1918, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; In [[County Down]], Northern Ireland there is a myth which says tunnels lead to the land of the subterranean [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], a group of people who are believed to have introduced [[Druidism]] to Ireland, and then went back underground.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bayley, Archaic England: An Essay in Deciphering Prehistory from Megalithic Monuments, 1919 Online Edition: [https://books.google.com/books?id=hHD5DFeFTZ0C&amp;pg=PA766&amp;dq=Bayley,+Harold+-+ARCHAIC+ENGLAND+county+down&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bT1zToD-Js6bOpfSrb0M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8QuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindu mythology, the underworld is referred to as [[Patala]]. In the Bengali version of the Hindu epic [[Ramayana]], it has been depicted how [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] were taken by the king of the underworld [[Ahiravan]], brother of the demon king [[Ravana]]. Later on they were rescued by [[Hanuman]]. The [[Angami Naga]] tribes of [[India]] claim that their ancestors emerged in ancient times from a subterranean land inside the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Angami NagaBrown, Account of Munnipore, 1968., p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taíno people|Taino]] from Cuba believe their ancestors emerged in ancient times from two caves in a mountain underground.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Russell Emerson, Indian Myths, 1965 "It is to the Cubans we are indebted for the following version of man's origin: It was from the depths of a deep cavern in the earth that mankind issued."&lt;/ref&gt;

Natives of the [[Trobriand Islands]] believe that their ancestors had come from a subterranean land through a cavern hole called "Obukula".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Freund, Myths of Creation; 1965, pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican folklore also tells of a cave in a mountain five miles south of [[Ojinaga]], and that Mexico is possessed by devilish creatures who came from inside the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;George, Wally&amp;nbsp;– Pilgrimage To The Devil., Article in Fate magazine, Aug. 1957, pp. 38–52&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[middle ages]], an ancient German myth held that some mountains located between [[Eisenach]] and [[Gotha (town)|Gin Germany]] hold a portal to the inner Earth. A Russian legend says the [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyeds]], an ancient [[Siberian]] [[tribe]], traveled to an underground cavern city to live inside the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Clark B Firestone and Ruth Hambidge, The Coasts of Ilusion, Harper &amp; Bros; First Edition, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian writer [[Dante]] describes a hollow earth in his well-known 14th century work ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', in which the fall of Lucifer from heaven caused an enormous funnel to appear in a previously solid and spherical earth, as well as an enormous mountain opposite it, "Purgatory".

In [[Native American mythology]], it is said that the ancestors of the [[Mandan people]] in ancient times emerged from a subterranean land through a cave at the north side of the [[Missouri River]].&lt;ref&gt;Martha Warren Beckwith, Mandan-Hidatsa myths and ceremonies, G. E. Stechert, 1937, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a tale about a tunnel in the [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation]] in [[Arizona]] near [[Help:Disambiguation|Cedar Creek]] which is said to lead inside the Earth to a land inhabited by a mysterious tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Grenville Goodwin, Myths and Tales of the White Mountain Apache, 1939, p. 20 (Kessinger Publishing have reprinted the book in 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the belief of the [[tribe]]s of the [[Iroquois]] that their ancient ancestors emerged from a subterranean world inside the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;William Martin Beauchamp, Iroquois folk lore: gathered from the Six Nations of New York, I. J. Friedman, 1965, pp. 152–53&lt;/ref&gt; The elders of the [[Hopi people]] believe that a [[Sipapu]] entrance in the [[Grand Canyon]] exists which leads to the [[underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;Pages from Hopi history, Harry Clebourne James, University of Arizona Press, 1974, Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arizona and the West, Volume 17, University of Arizona Press., 1975, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brazilian Indians]], who live alongside the [[Parima River]] in Brazil, claim that their forefathers emerged in ancient times from an underground land, and that many of their ancestors still remained inside the Earth. Ancestors of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] supposedly came from underground caves which are located east of [[Cuzco]], Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Osbourne, South American Mythology. New York: Peter Bedrick Books, 1986, pp. 42, 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th and 18th centuries===

[[File:Hollow Earth.svg|thumb|150px|[[Edmond Halley]]'s hypothesis.]]

[[Edmond Halley]] in 1692&lt;ref name="halley"&gt;Halley, Edmond, ''An Account of the cause of the Change of the Variation of the Magnetic Needle; with an Hypothesis of the Structure of the Internal Parts of the Earth'', Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society of London, No. 195, 1692, pp 563–578&lt;/ref&gt; put forth the idea of Earth consisting of a hollow shell about {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick, two inner concentric shells and an innermost core. Atmospheres separate these shells, and each shell has its own magnetic poles. The spheres rotate at different speeds. Halley proposed this scheme in order to explain anomalous compass readings. He envisaged the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] inside as [[luminosity|luminous]] (and possibly inhabited) and speculated that escaping gas caused the [[Aurora Borealis]].&lt;ref name="halley2"&gt;Halley, Edmond, ''An Account of the Late Surprizing Appearance of the Lights Seen in the Air, on the Sixth of March Last; With an Attempt to Explain the Principal Phaenomena thereof;'', Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society of London, No. 347 (1716), pp. 406–28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[L. Sprague de Camp|De Camp]] and [[Willy Ley|Ley]] have claimed (in their ''[[Lands Beyond]]'') that [[Leonhard Euler]] also proposed a hollow-Earth idea, getting rid of multiple shells and postulating an interior sun {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} across to provide light to advanced inner-Earth civilizations but they provide no references; indeed, Euler did not propose a hollow-Earth, but there is a slightly related [[thought experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/editorial/euler/How%20Euler%20Did%20It%2042%20Hollow%20earth.pdf Euler and the Hollow Earth: Fact or Fiction?]&lt;/ref&gt;

De Camp and Ley also claim that [[Sir John Leslie]] expanded on Euler's idea, suggesting two central suns named Pluto and Proserpine (this was unrelated to the planet [[Pluto]], which was discovered and named a century later). Leslie did propose a hollow Earth in his 1829 ''Elements of Natural Philosophy'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;449–53), but does not mention interior suns. Jules Verne alludes to the Pluto-Proserpine theory, which he attributes to "an English captain", in ''Journey to the Center of the Earth.''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.weblitera.com/sync/?id=111&amp;l1=4&amp;l2=1&amp;ch=30&amp;l=en#.Wc6Gb4qQx3k&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Le Clerc Milfort]] in 1781 led a journey with hundreds of [[Creek Indians]] to a series of [[caverns]] near the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] above the junction of the [[Mississippi River]]. According to Milfort the original Creek Indian ancestors are believed to have emerged out to the surface of the Earth in ancient times from the caverns. Milfort also claimed the caverns they saw "could easily contain 15,000&amp;nbsp;– 20,000 families."&lt;ref&gt;Migration Legend of the Creek Indians, Volumes 1–2, Albert S. Gatschet, Ams Pr Inc, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Franco-American review, Volumes 1–2, the Yale University Press, 1938, p. 111. Also see The Venus Calendar Observatory at Aztec New Mexico, Allan Macgillivray III, 2010, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
In 1818, [[John Cleves Symmes, Jr.]] suggested that the Earth consisted of a hollow shell about {{convert|1300|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick, with openings about {{convert|2300|km|mi|abbr=on}} across at both [[geographical pole|poles]] with 4 inner shells each open at the poles. Symmes became the most famous of the early Hollow Earth proponents, and [[Hamilton, Ohio]], even has a monument to him and his ideas.&lt;ref name="atlasobscura"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hollow-earth-monument |title=Hollow Earth Monument &amp;#124; Atlas Obscura: John Symmes Hollow Earth monument |publisher=atlasobscura.com|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed making an expedition to the [[North Pole]] hole, thanks to efforts of one of his followers, [[James McBride (pioneer)|James McBride]].

[[Jeremiah N. Reynolds|Jeremiah Reynolds]] also delivered lectures on the "Hollow Earth" and argued for an expedition. Reynolds went on an expedition to Antarctica himself but missed joining the [[Wilkes Expedition|Great U.S. Exploring Expedition]] of 1838–1842, even though that venture was a result of his agitation.

Though Symmes himself never wrote a book about his ideas, several authors' published works discussing his ideas. McBride wrote ''Symmes' Theory of Concentric Spheres'' in 1826. It appears that Reynolds has an article that appeared as a separate booklet in 1827: ''Remarks of Symmes' Theory Which Appeared in the American Quarterly Review.'' In 1868, a professor W.F. Lyons published ''The Hollow Globe'' which put forth a Symmes-like Hollow Earth hypothesis, but failed to mention Symmes himself. Symmes's son Americus then published ''The Symmes' Theory of Concentric Spheres'' in 1878 to set the record straight.

[[William Fairfield Warren]], in his book ''Paradise Found–The Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole,'' (1885) presented his belief that humanity originated on a continent in the Arctic called [[Hyperborea]]. This influenced some early Hollow Earth proponents. According to Marshall Gardner, both the [[Eskimo]] and [[Mongolian peoples]] had come from the interior of the Earth through an entrance at the [[North pole]].&lt;ref&gt;A Journey to the Earth's Interior, Marshall Gardner, Mokelumne Hill Pr, 1974 Edition, {{ISBN|0-7873-1192-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===20th century===

''[[NEQUA or The Problem of the Ages]]'', first serialized in a newspaper printed in Topeka, Kansas in 1900 and considered an early feminist utopian novel, mentions John Cleves Symmes' theory as an explanation for the hollow Earth they sail into.

An early twentieth-century proponent of hollow Earth, William Reed, wrote ''[[Phantom of the Poles]]'' in 1906. He supported the idea of a hollow Earth, but without interior shells or inner sun.

The [[spiritualist]] writer [[Walburga, Lady Paget]] in her book ''Colloquies with an unseen friend'' (1907) was an early writer to mention the hollow Earth hypothesis. She claimed that cities exist beneath a desert, which is where the people of [[Atlantis]] moved. She said an entrance to the subterranean kingdom will be discovered in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Paget Walburga, Colloquies with an unseen friend, William Rider &amp; Son., London., 1909., p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall Gardner wrote ''A Journey to the Earth's Interior'' in 1913 and published an expanded edition in 1920. He placed an interior sun in the Earth and built a working model of the Hollow Earth which he patented ({{US patent|1096102}}). Gardner made no mention of Reed, but did criticize Symmes for his ideas. Around the same time, [[Vladimir Obruchev]] wrote a novel titled ''Plutonia'', in which the Hollow Earth possessed an inner Sun and was inhabited by prehistoric species. The interior was connected with the surface by an opening in the [[Arctic]].

The explorer [[Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski|Ferdynand Ossendowski]] wrote a book in 1922 titled ''Beasts, Men and Gods''. Ossendowski said he was told about a subterranean kingdom that exists inside the Earth. It was known to [[Buddhists]] as [[Agartha|Agharti]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferdynand Ossendowski (1922). Beasts, Men and Gods. New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Papashvily]] in his ''Anything Can Happen'' (1940) claimed the discovery in the [[Caucasus mountains]] of a cavern containing human [[skeletons]] "with heads as big as bushel baskets" and an ancient tunnel leading to the centre of the Earth. One man entered the tunnel and never returned.&lt;ref&gt;George &amp; Helen Papashvily,&amp;nbsp;– Anything Can Happen., Harper &amp; Bros., New York, NY., 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist [[Lobsang Rampa]] in his book ''The Cave of the Ancients'' said an underground chamber system exists beneath the [[Himalayas]] of [[Tibet]], filled with ancient [[machinery]], [[Document|records]] and treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Cave of the Ancients, Lobsang Rampa, Random House, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Grumley]], a [[cryptozoologist]], has linked [[Bigfoot]] and other [[hominid]] [[cryptids]] to ancient tunnel systems [[:wikt:underground|underground]].&lt;ref&gt;There are Giants in the Earth, Michael Grumley, Panther Books, 1976, pp. 42–47&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[ancient astronaut]] writer [[Peter Kolosimo]] a robot was seen entering a subterranean tunnel below a [[monastery]] in Mongolia. Kolosimo also claimed a light was seen from underground in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kolosimo]], Not of this World, Sphere Books 1974 {{ISBN|0-7221-5309-0}} also see Peter Kolosimo, Timeless Earth, Citadel Pr, 1988 Edition {{ISBN|0-8065-1070-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolosimo and other ancient astronaut writers such as [[Robert Charroux]] linked these activities to UFOs.

A book by a "Dr. [[Raymond W. Bernard|Raymond Bernard]]" which appeared in 1964, ''The Hollow Earth'', exemplifies the idea of UFOs coming from inside the earth, and adds the idea that the [[Ring Nebula]] proves the existence of hollow worlds, as well as speculation on the fate of [[Atlantis]] and the origin of flying saucers.&lt;ref name="reece"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Reece  | first =Gregory L. | title =UFO Religion: Inside Flying Saucer Cults and Culture   | publisher =I.

The science fiction [[pulp magazine]] ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' promoted one such idea from 1945 to 1949 as "the Shaver Mystery". The magazine's editor, [[Raymond A. Palmer|Ray Palmer]], ran a series of stories by [[Richard Sharpe Shaver]], claiming that a superior pre-historic race had built a [[honeycomb]] of caves in the Earth, and that their degenerate descendants, known as "Dero", live there still, using the fantastic machines abandoned by the ancient races to torment those of us living on the surface. As one characteristic of this torment, Shaver described "voices" that purportedly came from no explainable source. Thousands of readers wrote to affirm that they, too, had heard the fiendish voices from inside the Earth. The writer [[David Hatcher Childress]] authored ''Lost Continents and the Hollow Earth'' (1998) in which he reprinted the stories of Palmer and defended the Hollow Earth idea based on alleged tunnel systems beneath South America and Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hatcher Childress]] ''Lost Continents and the Hollow Earth ''Adventures Unlimited Press, 1998 {{ISBN|978-0932813633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollow Earth proponents have claimed a number of different locations for the entrances which lead inside the Earth. Other than the North and South poles, entrances in locations which have been cited include: Paris in France,&lt;ref&gt;Alien races and Fantastic Civilizations., Serge Hutin, Berkeley Medallion Books, 1975, pp. 109–132&amp;nbsp;– In the Bowels of the Earth: Refers to the mysterious catacombs beneath Paris, and other underground mysteries which lead inside the Earth.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Staffordshire]] in England,&lt;ref&gt;The Under-People, Eric Norman, Award Books, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montreal]] in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Inner Earth People And Outer Space People, William L.

=== Concave Hollow Earths ===
[[File:Concave hollow Earths.svg|thumb|200px|An example of a concave hollow Earth. Humans live on the interior, with the universe in the center]]

Instead of saying that humans live on the outside surface of a hollow planet—sometimes called a "convex" Hollow Earth hypothesis—some have claimed humans live on the ''inside'' surface of a hollow [[spherical]] world, so that our universe itself lies in that world's interior. This has been called the "concave" Hollow Earth hypothesis or skycentrism.

[[Cyrus Teed]], a doctor from upstate New York, proposed such a concave Hollow Earth in 1869, calling his scheme "Cellular Cosmogony".&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/07/fantastically-wrong-hollow-earth/ |title=Fantastically Wrong: The Legendary Scientist Who Swore Our Planet Is Hollow &amp;#124; WIRED |publisher=wired.com|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teed founded a group called the [[Koreshan Unity]] based on this notion, which he called [[Koreshanity]]. The main colony survives as a preserved Florida state historic site, at [[Estero, Florida]], but all of Teed's followers have now died. Teed's followers claimed to have experimentally verified the concavity of the Earth's curvature, through surveys of the Florida coastline making use of "rectilineator" equipment.

Several twentieth-century German writers, including Peter Bender, Johannes Lang, Karl Neupert, and Fritz Braut, published works advocating the Hollow Earth hypothesis, or ''Hohlweltlehre''. It has even been reported, although apparently without historical documentation, that Adolf Hitler was influenced by concave Hollow Earth ideas and sent an expedition in an unsuccessful attempt to spy on the British fleet by pointing infrared cameras up at the sky.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Egypt]]ian mathematician [[Mostafa A. Abdelkader|Mostafa Abdelkader]] wrote several scholarly papers working out a detailed mapping of the Concave Earth model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=M.|last=Abdelkader|title=A Geocosmos: Mapping Outer Space Into a Hollow Earth|issue=6|journal=Speculations in Science &amp; Technology|pages=81–89|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Notices of the American Mathematical Society,'' (Oct. 1981 and Feb. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

In one chapter of his book ''On the Wild Side'' (1992), [[Martin Gardner]] discusses the Hollow Earth model articulated by Abdelkader. According to Gardner, this hypothesis posits that light rays travel in circular paths, and slow as they approach the center of the spherical star-filled cavern. No energy can reach the center of the cavern, which corresponds to no point a finite distance away from Earth in the widely accepted scientific cosmology. A drill, Gardner says, would lengthen as it traveled away from the cavern and eventually pass through the "point at infinity" corresponding to the center of the Earth in the widely accepted scientific cosmology. Supposedly no experiment can distinguish between the two cosmologies.

Gardner notes that "most mathematicians believe that an inside-out universe, with properly adjusted physical laws, is empirically irrefutable". Gardner rejects the concave Hollow Earth hypothesis on the basis of [[Occam's razor]].&lt;ref&gt;''On the Wild Side'' (1992), Martin Gardner, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Purportedly verifiable hypotheses of a "Concave Hollow Earth" need to be distinguished from a thought experiment
which defines a [[Coordinates (elementary mathematics)|coordinate]] transformation such that the interior of the Earth becomes "exterior" and the exterior becomes "interior". (For example, in spherical coordinates, let radius ''r'' go to ''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''r'' where ''R'' is the Earth's radius.) The transformation entails corresponding changes to the forms of physical laws. This is not a hypothesis but an illustration of the fact that any description of the physical world can be equivalently expressed in more than one way.&lt;ref name="gardnertransformation"&gt;On the Wild Side, 1992, [[Martin Gardner]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gravity ===
{{main|Schiehallion experiment|Cavendish experiment}}
Another set of scientific arguments against a Hollow Earth or any hollow planet comes from [[gravity]]. Massive objects tend to clump together gravitationally, creating non-hollow spherical objects such as stars and planets. The solid sphere is the best way in which to minimize the [[gravitational potential energy]] of a physical object; having hollowness is unfavorable in the energetic sense. In addition, ordinary matter is not strong enough to support a hollow shape of planetary size against the force of gravity; a planet-sized hollow shell with the known, observed thickness of the Earth's crust would not be able to achieve [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] with its own mass and would collapse.

Based upon the size of the Earth and the force of gravity on its surface, the average density of the planet Earth is 5.515&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and typical densities of surface rocks are only half that (about 2.75&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). If any significant portion of the Earth were hollow, the average density would be much lower than that of surface rocks. The only way for Earth to have the force of gravity that it does is for much more dense material to make up a large part of the interior. Nickel-iron alloy under the conditions expected in a non-hollow Earth would have densities ranging from about 10 to 13&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which brings the average density of Earth to its observed value.

=== Direct observation ===
Drilling holes does not provide direct evidence against the hypothesis. The deepest hole drilled to date is the [[Kola Superdeep Borehole]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iflscience.com/environment/deepest-hole-world/|title=What's At The Bottom Of The Deepest Hole On Earth?|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a true vertical drill-depth of more than 7.5 miles (12 kilometers). However, the distance to the center of the Earth is nearly 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers). Oil wells with longer depths are not vertical wells; the total depths quoted are measured depth (MD) or equivalently, along-hole depth (AHD) as these wells are deviated to horizontal. Their true vertical depth (TVD) are typically less than 4000 m.

==In fiction==
{{Main|Subterranean fiction}}

The idea of a hollow Earth is a common element of fiction, appearing as early as [[Ludvig Holberg]]'s 1741 novel ''Nicolai Klimii iter subterraneum'' ([[Niels Klim's Underground Travels]]), in which Nicolai Klim falls through a cave while spelunking and spends several years living on a smaller globe both within and the inside of the outer shell.

Other notable pre-20th century examples include [[Giacomo Casanova]]'s 1788 ''Icosaméron'', a 5-volume, 1,800-page story of a brother and sister who fall into the Earth and discover the subterranean utopia of the Mégamicres, a race of multicolored, hermaphroditic dwarves; ''[[Symzonia: A Voyage of Discovery]]'' by a "Captain Adam Seaborn" (1820) which reflected the ideas of John Cleves Symmes, Jr.; [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s 1838 novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]];'' [[Jules Verne]]'s 1864 novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]],'' which described a prehistoric subterranean world; and [[George Sand]]'s 1864 novel ''Laura, Voyage dans le Cristal'' where unseen and giant [[crystal]]s could be found in the interior of the Earth.

In [[William Henry Hudson]]'s [[1887 in literature|1887]] romance, ''[[A Crystal Age]]'', the protagonist falls down a hill into a [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|Utopian]], [[Asexuality|asexual]], [[pastoral]] [[paradise]]; since he falls into this world, it is sometimes classified as a hollow Earth story; although the hero himself thinks he may have [[Time travel in fiction|traveled forward in time]] by millennia.

The idea was used by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the creator of [[Tarzan]], in the seven-novel "[[Pellucidar]]" series, beginning with ''[[At the Earth's Core (novel)|At the Earth's Core]]'' (1914). Using a mechanical drill, his heroes discover a prehistoric world, called Pellucidar, 500 miles below the surface, that is lit by an inner sun.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000816193019/http://www.literature.org/authors/burroughs-edgar-rice/at-the-earths-core/ At the Earth's Core], by Edgar Rice Burroughs&lt;/ref&gt; The 1915 novel ''[[Plutonia (novel)|Plutonia]] ''by [[Vladimir Obruchev]] uses the concept of the hollow Earth to take the reader through various geological epochs.

In recent decades, the idea has become a staple of the science fiction and adventure genres, appearing in print; in film, notably as the premise for the creatures in ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]''; on television programs such as ''[[Sanctuary (TV series)|Sanctuary]]'', where Hollow Earth formed the core of the story arcs of the third and fourth seasons; in comics; in [[role-playing game]]s, such as the [[Hollow World Campaign Set]] for [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]; in video games like ''[[Gears of War]]'', where humans live on an Earth-like planet with a mostly hollow interior; and in many animated works, such as [[Torin's Passage]], where the hero must travel to the "lands below" to rescue his family.

{{Emotion}}

'''Humiliation''' is the abasement of [[pride]], which creates mortification or leads to a state of being [[Humility|humbled]] or reduced to lowliness or [[submission]]. It is an emotion felt by a person whose [[social status]], either by force or willingly, has just decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Neel.  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201408/the-psychology-humiliation "The Psychology of Humiliation."] ''Psychology Today''.  27 August 2014.  10 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be brought about through  [[intimidation]], physical or mental [[mistreatment]] or trickery, or by [[embarrassment]] if a person is revealed to have committed a socially or legally unacceptable act. Whereas [[humility]] can be sought alone as a means to de-emphasize the ego, humiliation must involve other person(s), though not necessarily directly or willingly. 

Humiliation is currently an active research topic, and is now seen as an important – and complex – core dynamic in human [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], having implications at intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional and international levels.&lt;ref name=Lindner&gt;Lindner, Evelin, Making Enemies: Humiliation and International Conflict. London, England: Praeger Security International, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects==
A person who suffers from severe humiliation could experience [[Major depressive disorder|major depressions]], suicidal states, and severe anxiety states such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The loss of status, like losing a job or being labeled as a liar or discredited unfairly, could cause people inability to behave normally in their communities. Humiliated individuals could be provoked and crave for revenge, and some people could feel worthless, hopeless and helpless, creating suicidal thoughts if justice is not met. It also can lead to new insights, activism and a new kinship with marginalized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Torres |first=Walter J. |last2=Bergner |first2=Raymond M. |date=June 2010 |title=Humiliation: Its Nature and Consequences |url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/38/2/195.full |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law]] |publisher=AAPL |volume=38 |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feelings of humiliation can produce 'humiliated fury'&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helen B. 1971, ''Shame and Grief in Neurosis.'' New York: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which, when turned inward can result in [[apathy]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and when turned outward can give rise to [[paranoia]], sadistic behaviour and fantasies of revenge. Klein explains, "When it is outwardly directed, humiliated fury unfortunately creates additional victims, often including innocent bystanders ... . When it is inwardly directed, the resulting self-hate renders victims incapable of meeting their own needs, let alone having energy available to love and care for others." He goes on to say, "In either case, those who are consumed by humiliated fury are absorbed in themselves or their cause, wrapped in wounded pride..."&lt;ref name=Klein /&gt; 

A study by researchers at the University of Michigan revealed that “the same regions of the brain that become active in response to painful sensory experiences are activated during intense experiences of social rejection.” In other words, humiliation and isolation are experienced as intensely as physical pain.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;[http://www.onbeing.org/blog/the-violence-of-humiliation/6753 Martin, Courtney E. "The Violence of Humiliation", ''On Being'', September 10, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishments and interrogation tactics==
[[File:Garotte - Excerpt from Pedro Berruguete - Saint Dominic Presiding over an Auto-da-fe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Non-trinitarian]] [[Cathars]] being burnt at the stake in an ''[[auto-de-fé]]'' (c. 1495, with [[garrote]] and [[phallus]]), presided over by [[Saint Dominic]], oil on panel by [[Pedro Berruguete]].]]

Humiliating of one person  by another (the humiliator) is often used as a way of asserting power over them, and is a common form of [[oppression]] or [[abuse]] used in a [[Police abuse|police]], military, or [[Prisoner abuse|prison]] context during legal interrogations or illegal [[torture]] sessions. Many now-obsolete public [[punishment]]s were deliberately designed to be humiliating, e.g. [[tarring and feathering]] lawbreakers, [[pillory]], "[[mark of shame]]" ([[social stigma|stigma]]) as a means of "making an example" of a person and presenting a deterrent to others. Some practices, such as tarring and feathering, became tools of unofficial mob justice. In folk customs such as the English [[Skimmington|skimmington rides]] and [[rough music]] (and their continental equivalents, such as the French [[Charivari]]), dramatic public demonstrations of moral disapproval were enacted to humiliate [[Norm (social)|transgressors]] and drive them out of the community.&lt;ref name="Thompson1992"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = E.

Some U.S. states have experimented with humiliating or [[shaming]] lawbreakers by publishing their names and indicating their offense (e.g., with soliciting prostitutes or drinking and driving). In 2010, there was public outcry about reports showing police in [[Dongguan]] and [[Guangdong]] in China leading a parade of arrested prostitutes for the purpose of humiliating them. The national [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] reprimanded the local police and affirmed that such punishments are not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/china24/20100727/100816.shtml|title=Prostitute humiliation dents police image|first=Ning|last=Zhang|date=2010-07-27|accessdate=2012-01-19|publisher=[[China Network Television]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A wider human perspective==
[[Image:The Humiliation of Emperor Valerian by Shapur, King of Persia, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|''The Humiliation of [[Valerian (emperor)|Emperor Valerian]] by [[Shapur I|Shapur]], King of Persia'' by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]].]]

Donald Klein described humiliation as "a powerful factor in human affairs that has, for a variety of reasons, been overlooked by students of individual and collective behavior. It is a pervasive and all too destructive influence in the behavior of individuals, groups, organizations, and nations."&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;Klein, Donald C. (Ed.), ''The Humiliation Dynamic: Viewing the Task of Prevention From a New Perspective'', Special Issue, Journal of Primary Prevention, Part I, 12, No. 2, 1991. New York, NY: Kluwer Academic/ Plenum Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is a subjective emotion, humiliation has a universal aspect which applies to all human beings: "it is the feeling of being put down, made to feel less than one feels oneself to be."&lt;ref name=Lindner /&gt;

A [[society]] that suffers from humiliation is an unstable one.  The [[cognitive dissonance]] between the way in which the society is perceived and the way in which it sees itself can be so great that violence can result on a massive scale against people belonging to an [[out group]].  According to [[Jonathan Sacks]], "By turning the question 'What did we do wrong?' into 'Who did this to us?', [hate against an out group] restores some measure of self-respect and provides a course of action.  In psychiatry, the clinical terms for this process are splitting and projection; it allows people to define themselves as victims."&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Jonathan.  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-return-of-anti-semitism-1422638910 "The Return of Anti-Semitism."] ''The Wall Street Journal''.  30 January 2015.  19 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19380">'''Involuntary memory''', also known as '''involuntary explicit memory''', '''involuntary conscious memory''', '''involuntary aware memory''', and most commonly, '''involuntary autobiographical memory''', is a subcomponent of [[memory]] that occurs when cues encountered in everyday life evoke recollections of the past without conscious effort. Voluntary memory, its binary opposite, is characterized by a deliberate effort to recall the past.
[[Image:Dunking a biscuit.jpg|thumb|Tea biscuit dunking is one of many examples of cues that can elicit involuntary memories, as evidenced by [[Marcel Proust]].]]

==Occurrences==
There appear to be at least three different contexts within which involuntary memory arises, as described by J.H. Mace in his book ''Involuntary Memory''.&lt;ref name="Mace2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=John H. Mace|title=Involuntary memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzrqadWxAYcC|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-3638-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include those that occur in everyday life, those that occur during the processes of voluntary and involuntary recall, and those that occur as part of a psychiatric syndrome.

===Precious fragments===
These include involuntary memories as they arise in everyday mental functioning, comprising the most common occurrences. They are characterized by their element of surprise, as they appear to come into conscious awareness spontaneously. They are the products of common every-day experiences such as eating a piece of cake, bringing to mind a past experience evoked by the taste. The term "precious fragments" was coined by [[Marigold Linton]], a pioneer in the study of [[autobiographical memory]] research.

===By-products of other memories===
These are less common, and appear to be the result of voluntary/involuntary retrieval{{vague|date=November 2012}}. Characteristic of such occurrences is the triggering effect this has, as one involuntary memory leads to another and so on. Again, Linton describes her own experiences with such memories as "...coming unbidden sometimes when my mind is silent, but also as by-products of searches for other information".&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt;

===Not so precious fragments===
Finally, some involuntary memories arise from traumatic experiences, and as such are fairly rare compared to other involuntary memories. Subjects describe them as salient, repetitive memories of traumatic events. The troubling nature of such memories makes these occurrences important to clinical researchers in their studies of psychiatric syndromes such as post-traumatic stress disorder.

==History==

===Hermann Ebbinghaus===
[[File:Ebbinghaus.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Herman Ebbinghaus (1850&amp;ndash;1909).]]

Born in Bremen, Germany in 1850, [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] is recognized as the first to apply the principles of experimental psychology to studying memory. He is especially well known for his introduction and application of nonsense syllables in studying memory. Nonsense syllables are combinations of letters that do not follow grammatical rules, and are meant to lack any meaning. Ebbinghaus designed the use of them to study his own memory by memorizing lists of nonsense syllables and testing his own recall after specified time intervals. From this he discovered the [[forgetting curve]] and the [[spacing effect]], two of his most well-known contributions. Ebbinghaus was also the first to attempt a description of involuntary memory, stating that, 'Often, even after years, mental states once present in consciousness return to it with apparent spontaneity and without any act of the will; that is, they are reproduced involuntarily. Here, also, in the majority of cases we at once recognize the returned mental state as one that has already been experienced; that is, we remember it. Under certain conditions, however, this accompanying consciousness is lacking, and we know only indirectly that the "now" must be identical with the "then"; yet we receive in this way a no less valid proof for its existence during the intervening time. As more exact observation teaches us, the occurrence of these involuntary reproductions is not an entirely random and accidental one. On the contrary they are brought about through the instrumentality of other immediately present mental images. Moreover, they occur in certain regular ways that, in general terms, are described under the so-called ''laws of association''.'&lt;ref&gt;Ebbinghaus, H. (1885/1964). Memory: A contribution to experimental psychology, (trans. H.A. Ruger and C.E. Bussenius). Dover, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcel Proust—Proustian memory===
[[File:Marcel Proust 1900-2.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Proust in 1900]]
[[Marcel Proust]] was the first person to coin the term involuntary memory, in his novel ''[[In Search of Lost Time|À la Recherche du Temps Perdu]]'' (''In Search of Lost Time'' or ''Remembrance of Things Past'').  Proust did not have any psychological background, and worked primarily as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, A. E. (2005). The contributions of Marcel Proust to psychoanalysis. Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry, 33(1), 137–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proust viewed involuntary memory as containing the "essence of the past", claiming that it was lacking from voluntary memory.  In his novel, he describes an incident where he was eating tea soaked cake, and a childhood memory of eating tea soaked cake with his aunt was "revealed" to him.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt;  From this memory, he then proceeded to be reminded of the childhood home he was in, and even the town itself.  This becomes a theme throughout ''In Search of Lost Time'', with sensations reminding Proust of previous experiences.  He dubbed these "involuntary memories".

==Current research==

===Chaining===
One idea that has recently become the subject of studies on involuntary memory is chaining. This is the concept that involuntary memories have the tendency to trigger other involuntary memories that are related. Typically, it is thought to be the contents of involuntary memories that are related to one another, thereby causing the chaining effect.

In a diary study done by J.H Mace, participants reported that frequently, when one involuntary memory arose, it would quickly trigger a series of other involuntary memories. This was recognized as the cueing source for involuntary memories.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt;

In work by Bernsten, the diary method was also applied to the study of involuntary memory chaining. The main hypothesis was that chaining would also occur on autobiographical memory tasks. Participants were asked to report the presence of involuntary memories while performing an autobiographical memory task. Results showed that participants did experience involuntary memory recall when they were recalling the past deliberately (also known as voluntary memory). This implies that involuntary memory production occurs as a product of chaining from voluntary memory—deliberate recall of the past.

===Priming===
A common question in the study of involuntary memory is related to priming; what is it that activates such a memory? Various studies have been conducted in recent years to observe the conditions under which involuntary memories are primed.

Mace, in one of his recent studies, wanted to test the notion that basic cognitive activities, such as thinking about the past, may prime involuntary memories. To test this idea, Mace set up a diary method study in which participants recorded involuntary memories they experienced during a two-week period, in a diary. During this two-week period, participants also had to come into a laboratory at intervals, and were instructed to recall memories from certain life periods (e.g., high school, first five years of marriage). Following this, comparing their involuntary memories to a control condition found that a significant number of their involuntary memories related to the time period they were instructed to recall. Such findings suggest that involuntary memories may be primed by even the simplest of cognitive tasks—namely, reminiscing and recalling the past.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt;

==Neurological basis==
[[File:Hippocampus.gif|thumb|right|The hippocampus is important for the successful retrieval of involuntary memories.]]
Research studies regarding the neurological functions of involuntary memory have been few in number. Thus far, only two neuroimaging studies have been conducted comparing involuntary memories to voluntary memories using [[Positron emission tomography|Positron Emission Tomography (PET)]].

The first study found that involuntary memory retrieval is mediated by the [[hippocampus]], which is known to be associated with successful episodic memory retrieval. In addition, activity in areas such as the left inferior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left hippocampus, and right superior occipital cortex, have been implicated in involuntary memory when dealing with involuntary word recognition tasks. Areas implicated with executive control processes such as right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral medial/lateral parietal cortex were more active during voluntary word recognition tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Rugg, M. D., Fletcher, P. C., Frith, C. D., J, R. S., &amp; Dolan, R. J. (1997). Brain regions supporting intentional and incidental memory: a PET study. NeuroReport (Oxford), 8 (5), 1283-1287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second study found that the medial temporal lobe, the posterior cingulate gyrus, and the precunueus, are activated during retrieval success with or without executive control seen within right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This implies that involuntary memories are successfully retrieved using the same system as voluntary memory when retrieving perceptual information. Voluntary and involuntary recall were both associated with increased activations in the posterior cingulated gyrus, left precuneus, and right parahippocampal gyrus. In addition, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left precuneus were more active during voluntary recall, while left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was more active during involuntary recall. It is suggested that the activation seen in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during involuntary memory recall reflects the attempt to prevent the recollected material from interfering with the semantic judgment task.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, N. M., Gjedde, A., &amp; Kupers, R. (2008). Neural mechanisms of voluntary and involuntary recall : A PET study. Behavioural brain research, 186 (2), 261-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of age==

===Development===
While age plays a role in memory capabilities, it has been found that general strategies used to encode (to remember) memories is more important.&lt;ref&gt;Sophian, C., &amp; Hagen, J. W. (1978). Involuntary memory and the development of retrieval skills in young children. Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 26 (3), 458–471.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those that are better at memorizing information are more likely to have more involuntary memories. 
 
In younger children (ages 10 and under), it has also been found that inducing involuntary memory during testing produced significantly better results than using voluntary memory.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, T. A. (1989). Developmental aspects of activating voluntary and involuntary memory processes during reading. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]], 14 (1), 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be accomplished by posing a vague, mildly related question or sentence prior to the actual test question.  In older children (aged 14 and above), the opposite holds, with strictly voluntary memory leading to better test results.

===Reminiscence bump===
The [[reminiscence bump]] is the phenomenon where in memories formed during adolescence and early adulthood are more commonly remembered than those throughout other periods in life.  This is due to the formation of [[self-identity]]&lt;ref&gt;Conway, M. A., Wang, Q., Hanyu, K., &amp; Haque, S. (2005). A cross-cultural investigation of autobiographical memory. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 36, 739–749. {{doi|10.1177/0022022105280512}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the development of cognitive abilities across the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, D. C., Rahhal, T. A., &amp; Poon, L. W. (1998). Things learned in early adulthood are remembered best. Memory &amp; Cognition, 26, 3-19. {{doi|10.3758/BF03211366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janssen, S. M. J., Kristo, G., Rouw, R., &amp; Murre, J. M. J. (2015). The relation between verbal and visuospatial memory and autobiographical memory. Consciousness and Cognition, 31, 12-23. {{doi|10.1016/j.concog.2014.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that this is true for both voluntary and involuntary memories.&lt;ref&gt;Schlagman, S., Kliegel, M., Schulz, J., &amp; Kvavilashvili, L. (2009). Differential effects of age on involuntary and voluntary autobiographical memory. Psychology and Aging, 24(2), 397–411. {{doi|10.1037/a0015785}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Age has been found to have a difference on the amount of memories recalled, but no age differences were found in the specificity of involuntary memories.

==The role of emotion==

===Emotion intensity===
[[Emotion]] plays a strong role in relation to [[emotion and memory|memory]].  It has been found that memories associated with stronger emotions (e.g.: being happy at your wedding) are more easily remembered and quickly recalled,&lt;ref&gt;D'Argembeau, A., &amp; Van der Linden, M. (2005). Influence of emotion on memory for temporal information. Emotion, 5(4), 503–507. {{doi|10.1037/1528-3542.5.4.503}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are those formed during moments of intense stress.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, N. M., &amp; Berntsen, D. (2008). The effect of emotional stress on involuntary and voluntary conscious memories. Memory, 16(1), 48–57.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same holds true for involuntary memories, with happy involuntary memories occurring twice as often as unhappy or neutral involuntary memories.&lt;ref&gt;Berntsen, D., &amp; Rubin, D. C. (2002). Emotionally charged autobiographical memories across the life span: The recall of happy, sad, traumatic and involuntary memories. Psychology and Aging, 17 (4), 636–652.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In clinical disorders==

===Posttraumatic stress disorder===
Often people who have been the victims of some type of trauma describe vivid memories that intrude on their thoughts spontaneously and without warning. Such mental intrusions, if maintained over time compose the hallmark symptom of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]].&lt;ref name="Berntsen2008"&gt;Berntsen, D., &amp; Rubin, D. C. (2008). The reappearance hypothesis revisited: Recurrent involuntary memories after traumatic events and in everyday life. Memory &amp; Cognition (pre-2012), 36 (2), 449-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]]'' defines a trauma as an event in which someone experiences, or witnesses' severe injury to themselves or others or a threat to their integrity. The person must also have responded with fear, helplessness or horror at the time of the trauma. The main psychological consequences of this include re-experiencing the traumatic event (through both intrusive thoughts and images), avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, and increased arousal levels.

When it comes to involuntary memory, researchers are mainly interested in the concept of these trauma-related intrusions, which generally involved some form of re-experiencing the event, including a sensory component (e.g., imagery in any modality be it visual, auditory etc.). These intrusions, often termed "[[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]]", make the victim feel as though they are reliving the trauma, and cause high levels of emotional arousal, and the sense of an impending threat. Typically, they are parts of the traumatic event that were most salient at the time, known as "hotspots" and have the definitive feature that they cause high levels of emotional distress, and may be difficult to recall deliberately. Although this is a defining feature of PTSD, intrusive memories are also frequently encountered in anxiety-based disorders, psychotic disorders and even within the general population.&lt;ref name=Berntsen2008/&gt; Regardless of the context in which they are encountered, intrusions tend to have the same central feature; that the stored information is being recalled involuntarily. It is thought that intrusions arise when an individual encounters stimuli similar to the stimuli that were processed and stored during the trauma, thus triggering the memory into the conscious mind.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt; A common example is one in which someone who has the victim of a car crash, upon hearing the screeching of tires experiences a flashback of their own collision, as if they are back at the original event.

===Psychosis===
Stressful and traumatic events, which may manifest as involuntary memories called ''flashbacks'', may trigger a wide range of anxiety-based and [[psychosis|psychotic]] disorders. [[Social phobia]],&lt;ref&gt;Hackmann, A., Clark, D. M., &amp; Mcmanus, F. (2000). Recurrent images and early memories in social phobia. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 38(6), 601–610.&lt;/ref&gt; [[bipolar disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;Mansell, W., &amp; Lam, D. (2004). A preliminary study of autobiographical memory in remitted bipolar and unipolar depression and the role of imagery in memory specificity. Memory, 12, 437–446.&lt;/ref&gt; [[major depressive disorder|depression]],&lt;ref&gt;Kuyken, W., &amp; Brewin, C. R. (1994). Stress and coping in depressed women. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 18(5), 403–412.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[agoraphobia]],&lt;ref&gt;Day, S. J., Holmes, E. A., &amp; Hackmann, A. (2004). Occurrence of imagery and its link with early memories in agoraphobia. Memory, 12, 416–427&lt;/ref&gt; are a few examples of disorders that have influences from flashbacks.

Psychosis is defined as a range of perceptual presentations, with the associated symptoms frequently referred to as either ''positive'' or ''negative''. Positive symptoms are delusional, and may include hallucinations, while negative symptoms are characterized by a "lack" of functioning, which may include a lack of affect (emotional feeling) and loss of motivation.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt; One study found that there was a high prevalence of trauma in patients with severe mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Mueser, K. T., Trumbettam S. L., Rosenberg, S. D., Vivader, R., Goodman, L. B., Osher, F. C., Auciello, P., &amp; Foy, D. W. (1998). Trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder in severe mental illness. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 66, 493–499.&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a small percentage had been diagnosed with PTSD when displaying PTSD-like symptoms. Therefore, the more complex symptoms of psychosis may prevent the clinical detection required when diagnosing PTSD. In addition, those who have been diagnosed with PTSD and have an identified form of trauma show positive symptoms of psychosis such as delusions and/or hallucinations.&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, S. E., Carlson, E. B., &amp; Sheikh, J. I. (2000). Psychotic symptoms in posttraumatic stress disorder. CNS Spectrums, 5(9), 52-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it has been suggested that individuals suffering from psychosis may be more vulnerable to intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;Steel, C., Fowler, D., &amp; Holmes, E. A. (2005). Trauma-related intrusions and psychosis: An information processing account. Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy, 33(2), 139–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kebony''' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] wood producer. The company has its roots in Wood Polymer Technologies (WPT), which was founded in 1996 and changed its name to Kebony in 2007. Kebony has a factory in [[Skien, Norway|Skien]] (Norway) and offices in [[Oslo, Norway|Oslo]] (Norway).

==Technology==

Kebony has developed an environmental technology which provides an alternative to threatened and endangered tropical hardwoods, and traditional impregnated wood. In the process, a liquid byproduct of the sugar industry, [[furfuryl alcohol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of the Kebony Technology |url=http://www.martenshout.be/assets/pdf/Kebony_tech-EXT_Jan14.pdf |publisher=martenshout.be |accessdate=11 Jan 2015 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to treat the wood. Using pressure, vacuum and heat treatment, the liquid transforms to [[furan resin]] and is tied together with the cell structure of the wood in order to improve the wood's abilities permanently. The woods used are [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]-certified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Stewardship Council|url=http://www.fsc.org/|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification|PEFC]]-certified and carry the [[Nordic Ecolabel]] "the Swan".

The technology has been described in multiple articles in media such as CNN,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whiteman|first=Hilary|title=From Norway, an eco-alternative to teak|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/BUSINESS/07/05/kebony.wood.deforestation/index.html|publisher=CNN.com|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kebony CEO Christian Jebsen tells CNN's Jim Boulden about the company's eco-friendly alternative to tropical hardwood. |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/business/2009/07/05/going.green.kebony.wood.cnn.html |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=31 May 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Eco-yacht' in Round the Island Race|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-12478847|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Economist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hard act to follow  Environment: Making softwoods more durable could reduce the demand for unsustainably logged tropical hardwoods|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14299540|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Financial Times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Timber, but not as we know it|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/f6e5b004-84ae-11df-9cbb-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1NvUkqggq|accessdate=31 May 2011|newspaper=Financial Times|date=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political anthropology}}
{{Anthropology |social/cultural}}

'''Legal anthropology''', also known as the '''anthropology of laws''', is a sub-discipline of [[anthropology]] which specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Greenhouse, Carol J. |title=Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell UP |year=1986 |pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The questions that Legal Anthropologists seek to answer concern how is [[law]] present in cultures? How does it manifest? How may anthropologists contribute to understandings of law?

Earlier legal anthropological research focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation.  [[Bronisław Malinowski]]'s 1926 work, ''Crime and Custom in Savage Society'', explored law, order, crime, and punishment among the [[Trobriand Islanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronislaw 1985[1926] Crime and Custom in Savage Society. Totowa, New Jersey:  Rowman &amp; Allanheld.&lt;/ref&gt;  The English lawyer Sir [[Henry Maine]] is often credited with founding the study of Legal Anthropology through his book ''[[Ancient Law]]'' (1861), and although his evolutionary stance has been widely discredited within the discipline, his questions raised have shaped the subsequent discourse of the study. This ethno-centric evolutionary perspective was pre-eminent in early Anthropological discourse on law, evident through terms applied such as ‘pre-law’ or ‘proto-law’ and applied by so-called armchair anthropologists. However, a turning point was presented in the 1926 publication of ''Crime and Custom in Savage Society'' by [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski]] based upon his time with the Trobriand Islanders. Through emphasizing the order present in acephelous societies, Malinowski proposed the cross-cultural examining of law through its established functions as opposed to a discrete entity. This has led to multiple researchers and ethnographies examining such aspects as order, dispute, conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation, in addition (and often antagonistically) to law-centred studies, with small-societal studies leading to insightful self-reflections and better understanding of the founding concept of law.

Legal anthropology remains a lively discipline with modern and recent applications including issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]], [[Islamophobia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowen |first=John R. |title=A New Anthropology of Islam |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world |year=2006 |publisher=Fordham University Press |location=New York |editor=Hent de Vries and Lawrence E. Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political uprisings.

==What is law?==
{{see also|Philosophy of law}}
Legal Anthropology provides a definition of law which differs from that found within modern legal systems. Hoebel (1954) offered the following definition of law: ''“A social norm is legal if its neglect or infraction is regularly met, in threat or in fact, by the application of physical force by an individual or group possessing the socially recognized privilege of so acting”''

Maine argued that human societies passing through three basic stages of legal development, from a group presided over by a senior agnate, through stages of territorial development and culminating in an elite forming normative laws of society, stating that ''“what the juristical oligarchy now claims is to monopolize the knowledge of the laws, to have the exclusive possession of the principles by which quarrels are decided”''

This [[evolutionary approach]], as has been stated, was subsequently replaced within the anthropological discourse by the need to examine the manifestations of law’s societal function. As according to [[Hoebel]], law has four functions:

1)	to identify socially acceptable lines of behaviour for inclusion in the culture. 
2)	To allocate authority and who may legitimately apply force.
3)	To settle trouble cases.
4)	To redefine relationships as the concepts of life change.

Legal theorist H. L. A. Hart, however, stated that law is a body of rules, and is a union of two sets of rules: 
# rules on conduct ("primary rules") &lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, "Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules," The Concept of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;
# rules about recognizing, changing, applying, and adjudicating on rules on conduct ("secondary rules") &lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, "Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules," The Concept of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within modern English Theory, law is a discrete and specialized topic. Predominantly positivist in character, it is closely linked to notions of a rule-making body, the judiciary and enforcement agencies. The centralized state organisation and isolates are essentials to the attributes of rules, courts and sanctions. To learn more on this view, see Hobbes. 1651 Leviathan, part 2, chapter 26  or Salmond, J. 1902 Jurisprudence.

However, this view of law is not applicable everywhere. There are many acephelous societies around the world where the above control mechanisms are absent. There are no conceptualized and isolated set of normative rules – these are instead embodied in everyday life. Even when there may be a discrete set of legal norms, these are not treated similarly to the English Legal System’s unequivocal power and unchallenged pre-eminence. Shamans, fighting and supernatural means are all mechanisms of superimposing rules within other societies. For example, within [[Rasmussen]]’s work of Across Arctic America (1927) he recounts [[Eskimo]] nith-songs being used as a public reprimand by expressing the wrongdoing of someone guilty.

Thus, instead of focusing upon the explicit manifestations of law, legal anthropologists have taken to examining the functions of law and how it is expressed. A view expressed by Leopold Pospisil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pospisil, Leopold |title=The Anthropology of Laws: A Comparative Theory  |year=1974|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; and encapsulated by Bronislaw Malinowski:

''“In such primitive communities I personally believe that law ought to be defined by function and not by form, that is we ought to see what are the arrangements, the sociological realities, the cultural mechanisms which act for the enforcement of law”''&lt;ref&gt;(1934: Introduction to Hogbin, Law and Order in Polynesia).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, law has been studied in ways that may be categorized by as:

1) prescriptive rules
2) observable regularities
3) Instances of dispute.

==Processual paradigm: order and conflict==

Order and regulatory behaviour are required if social life is to be maintained. The scale and shade of this behaviour depends on the values and beliefs held by a society deriving from implicit understandings of the norm developed through socialization. There are socially constructed norms with varying degrees of explicitness and levels of order. Conflict may not be interpreted as an extreme pathological event but as a regulatory acting force.

This processual understanding of conflict and dispute became apparent and subsequently heavily theorized upon by the anthropological discipline within the latter half of the nineteenth century as a gateway to the law and order of a society. Disputes have become to be recognised as necessary and constructive over pathological whilst the stated rules of law only explain some aspects of control and compliance. The context and interactions of a dispute are more informative about a culture than the rules.

Classic studies deriving theories of order from disputes include Evans-Pritchard work Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande which focused upon functional disputes surrounding sorcery and witchcraft practices, or Comaroff and Roberts (1981) work among the Tswana which examine the hierarchy of disputes, the patterns of contact and the effect norms affect the course of dispute as norms important to dispute are rarely ''“especially organised for jural purpose”'' &lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1957:58).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include:

[[Edmund Leach|Leach]], 1954. Political Systems of Highland Burma.
[[Fredrik Barth|Barth]], 1959. Political Leadership among Swat Pathans.

==Case study approach==

Within the history of Legal Anthropology there have been various methods of data gathering adopted; ranging from literature review of traveller/missionary accounts, consulting informants and lengthy participant observation.

Furthermore, when evaluating any research it is appropriate to have a robust methodology capable of scientifically analysing the topic at hand.

The broad method of study by legal anthropologists prevails upon the Case Study Approach first developed by Llewellyn and Hoebel in The Cheyenne Way (1941) not as ''“a philosophy but a technology”'' &lt;ref&gt;(Pospisil, 1973: 541).&lt;/ref&gt;

This methodology is applied to situations of cross-cultural conflict and the correlating resolution, which can have sets of legal notions and jural regularities extracted from them &lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1965: pp. 41; Pospisil, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

This method may be safe-guarded against accusations of imposing western ideological structures as it is often an emic sentiment: for example,

''“The Tiv drove me to the case method…what they were interested in. They put a lot of time and effort into cases”''
&lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1989: vii).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues of terminology and ethnology==

Regarding law, in Anthropology’s characteristically self-conscious manner, the comparative analysis inherent to Legal Anthropology has been speculated upon and most famously debated by [[Paul Bohannan]] and [[Max Gluckman]]. The discourse highlights one of the primary differences between British and American Anthropology regarding fieldwork approaches and concerns the imposition of Western terminology as ethnological categories of differing societies.&lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

Each author’s uses the Case Study Approach, however, the data’s presentation in terms of achieving comparativeness is a point of contention between them.

Paul Bohannan promotes the use of native terminology presented with ethnographic meaning as opposed to any Universal categories, which act as barriers to understanding the true nature of a culture’s legal system.

Advocating that it is better to appreciate native terms in their own medium, Bohannan critiques Gluckman’s work for its inherent [[bias]].

Gluckman has argued that Bohannan’s excessive use of native terminology creates barriers when attempting to achieve comparative analysis. He in turn has suggested that in order to further the cross-cultural comparative study of law, we should use English terms and concepts of law which will aid in the refinement of dispute facts and interrelations &lt;ref&gt;(Gluckman, 1965: 26).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, all native terms should be described and translated into an Anglo-American conceptual equivalent for the purpose of comparison.

==Processes==

As disputes and order began to be recognised as categories worthy of study, interest in the inherent aspects of conflicts emerged within legal anthropology. The processes and actors involved within the events became an object of study for ethnographers as they embraced conflict as a data-rich source.

One example of such an interest is expressed by [[Philip Gulliver]], 1963, Social Control in an African Society in which the intimate relations between disputes are postulated as being important. He examines the patterns of alliance between actors of a dispute and the strategies that develop as a result, the roles of mediators and the typologies for intervention.

==Key questions in legal anthropology==

*'''Issues of Legal Pluralism'''.
See ''[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15129292 Lyon, 2002] Local arbitration and conflict deferment in Punjab, Pakistan'' or ''Engel, D. 1980. Legal pluralism in an American community: perspectives on a civil trial court.''

*'''The legitimacy of Universal Human Rights'''.
Political anthropologists have had much to say about the UDHR(Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Original critiques, most notably by the AAA(American Anthropological Association), argued that cultural ideas of rights and entitlement differ between societies. They warned that any attempt to endorse one set of values above all others amounted to a new western imperialism, and would be counter to ideas of cultural relativism. Most anthropologists now agree that universal human rights have a useful place in today's world. Zechenter (1997) argues there are practices, such as Indian 'sati' (the burning of a widow on her husband's funeral pyre) that can be said to be wrong, despite justifications of tradition. This is because such practices are about much more than a culturally established world view, and frequently develop or revive as a result of socio-economic conditions and the balance of power within a community. As culture is not bounded and unchanging, there are multiple discourses and moral viewpoints within any community and among the various actors in such events (Merry 2003). Cultural relativists risk supporting the most powerfully asserted position at the expense of those who are subjugated under it.

More recent contributions to the question of universal human rights include analysis of their use in practice, and how global discourses are translated into local contexts (Merry 2003). Anthropologists such as Merry (2006) note how the legal framework of the UNDHR is not static but is actively used by communities around the globe to construct meaning. As much as the document is a product of western Enlightenment thinking, communities have the capacity to shape its meaning to suit their own agendas, incorporating its principles in ways that empower them to tackle their own local and national discontents.

Female genital cutting (FGC), also known as female circumcision or female genital mutilation remains a hotly debated, controversial issue contested particularly among legal anthropologists and human rights activists. Through her ethnography (1989) on the practice of pharonic circumcision among the Hofriyat of Sudan (1989) Boddy maintains that understanding local cultural norms is of crucial importance when considering intervention to prevent the practice. Human rights activists attempting to eradicate FGC using the legal framework of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR) as their justification, run the risk of imposing a set of ideological principles, alien to the culture attempting to be helped, potentially facing hostile reactions. Moreover, the UNDHR as a legal document, is contested by some as being restrictive in its prescription of what is and is not deemed a violation of a human right (Ross 2003) and  overlooks local customary justifications which operate outside of an international legalistic framework (Ross 2003). Increasingly (FGC) is becoming a global issue due to increased mobility. What was once deemed a largely African practice has seen a steady increase in European countries such as Britain. Although made illegal in 1985 there have as yet been no convictions and girls as old as nine continue to have the procedure. Legislation has now also been passed in Sweden, the United States and France where there have been convictions. Black, J. A. and Debelle, G. D. (1995) "Female Genital Mutilation in Britain" ''British Medical Journal''.

==Further information==
There are a number of useful introductions to the field of legal anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example Moore, Sally Falk, ''Law and Anthropology: A Reader'', (edited), Blackwell, 2004, pp. 20-25, {{ISBN|1-4051-0228-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sally Falk Moore]], a leading legal anthropologist, held both a law degree and a PhD in anthropology. An increasing number of legal anthropologists hold both [[juris doctor|JD]]s and advanced degrees in anthropology, and some teach in [[law school]]s while maintaining scholarly connections within the field of legal anthropology; examples include Rebecca French, John Conley, [[Elizabeth Mertz]], and [[Annelise Riles]]. Such combined expertise has also been turned to more [[applied anthropology|applied anthropological]] pursuits such as tribal advocacy and [[forensic anthropology|forensic ethnography]] by practitioners. There is a growing interest in the intersection of legal and [[linguistic anthropology]].

A '''Lemnian deed''' is the cruel slaughter of someone as revenge. There are two possible origins for this term: the epic of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], where [[Pelasgian Creation Myth|Pelasgian]] women killed their men, and that of Herodotus narrative where the Pelasgians killed captive mothers and children.

As is usual in other nationalistic [[Epic poetry|epics]] as well, other people and tribes are deemed to have barbaric tendencies. Besides, Pelasgians of [[Lemnos]] spoke pre-Greek [[Lemnian language|Lemnian]], and were technologically inferior (as can be seen from the weapons found in burials), which further promoted their primitive nature.

== Jasonian origin ==

It is said that Pelasgian women decided to kill their men, due to the men's cheating with the mainland Thracian women. In anger, the women slaughtered the men in their sleep and lived without men for many years, until [[Jason| Jason and the Argonauts]] arrived during [[Jason#The Quest for the Golden Fleece|The Quest for the Golden Fleece]].
They mingled with the women and created a new race: the [[Minyae]].

== Pelasgian origin ==

Michael Stewart relates the story of [[Herodotus]] thus:&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Michael. "People, Places &amp; Things: Lemnos", Greek Mythology: From the Iliad to the Fall of the Last Tyrant. http://messagenetcommresearch.com/myths/ppt/Lemnos_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The historian, Herodotus, relates the story that when the Pelasgians were driven from Attika (Attica) they kidnapped a number of Athenian women and took them to Lemnos; the women were defiant and taught their children to act and speak like Athenians; the Pelasgians would not accept such rebellious attitudes and killed the captive mothers and children and thus the term Lemnian Deeds became an enduring insult to the honor and manhood of the inhabitants.

'''MAC address anonymization''' performs a [[one-way function]] on a [[MAC address]] so that the result may be used in [[tracking system]]s for reporting and the general public, while making it nearly impossible to obtain the original MAC address from the result. The idea is that this process allows companies like [[Google]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://junkee.com/google-maps-has-been-tracking-your-every-move-and-theres-a-website-to-prove-it/39639|title=Google Maps Has Been Tracking Your Every Move, And There's A Website To Prove It|website=Junkee|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/09/28/how-your-iphone-has-been-tracking-your-every-move-in-secret-4884687/ |title=How your iPhone has been tracking your every move in secret &amp;#124; Metro News |website=Metro.co.uk |date=2014-09-28 |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[iInside]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-03-10|title=iInside retail brochure: Leading the market in indoor location techno…|url=http://www.slideshare.net/KelliePeterson/iinside-retail-brochure}}&lt;/ref&gt; - which track users movements via computer hardware to simultaneously preserve the identities of the people they are tracking, as well as the hardware itself.

==Examples==
An example of MAC address anonymization would be to use a simple hash algorithm. Given an address of &lt;code&gt;11:22:33:44:55:66&lt;/code&gt;, the [[MD5]] hash algorithm produces &lt;code&gt;eb341820cd3a3485461a61b1e97d31b1&lt;/code&gt; (32 hexadecimal digits).&lt;ref&gt;echo -n "112233445566"|md5sum = eb341820cd3a3485461a61b1e97d31b1&lt;/ref&gt;

An address only one character different (&lt;code&gt;11:22:33:44:55:67&lt;/code&gt;) produces &lt;code&gt;391907146439938c9821856fa181052e&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;echo -n "112233445567"|md5sum = 391907146439938c9821856fa181052e&lt;/ref&gt; an entirely different hash due to the [[avalanche effect]].

==Why this does not work in practice==
Tracking companies rely on the assumption that address anonymization is akin to [[encryption]]. Given a message, and an encryption method that is well known to both the encoder and potential decryptor, modern encryption methods (such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) or [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]]) will yield a result that is unbreakable in practice.

The problem lies in the fact that there are only 2&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt; (281,474,976,710,656) possible MAC addresses. Given the encoding algorithm, an index can easily be created for each possible address.

Several years ago, the building of such an index would have been difficult due to the compute time involved. With modern, [[parallel computing|parallel]], [[cloud computing]], the index generation can be easily divided among the number of processors desired.

On a 2.5&amp;nbsp;GHz processor, a [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] program was able to produce the following results:{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!CPU Count
!Iterations
!Time (seconds)
|-
|1
|2.814 x 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;
|3.0489 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|1,000
|2.814 x 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;
|3.0489 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|1,000,000
|2.814 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;
|304.89
|}
Thus, a million processors could create the entire index in just over five minutes, and 100,000 processors in less than 85 hours. Once the [[rainbow table]] is complete, conversions of "anonymized" addresses to their actual addresses is almost instantaneous.

==Salting==
{{main|Salt (cryptography)}}
One common way of mitigating such brute force attacks is to append a random [[salt (cryptography)|salt]] into the MAC address before hashing. A salt is a secret string of characters that makes the search space for attackers larger. The effect is that the brute force attack can no longer target the valid range of MAC addresses. Lists of salted and hashed MAC addresses would be impossible to translate, given that the salt is long enough and created in a way that is difficult to guess.

The entity holding the secret salt can still perform deanonymization by attacking the hashed MAC using the technique in the previous chapter. Attackers could also obtain the secret salt through social engineering, phishing or other means.

==Truncating==
Where data protection law requires anonymization, the method used should exclude any possibility of the original MAC address to be identified. Some companies truncate [[IPv4]] addresses by removing the final [[octet (computing)|octet]], thus in effect retaining information about the user's [[ISP]] or [[subnet]], but not directly identifying the individual. The activity could then originate from any of 254 [[IP addresses]]. This may not always be enough to guarantee anonymization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2008/wp148_en.pdf|publisher=ARTICLE 29 DATA PROTECTION WORKING PARTY|accessdate=20 October 2017|title=Opinion 1/2008 on data protection issues related to search engines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{US fed civ pro}}

In law, the terms '''moot''' and '''mootness''' have different meanings in [[British English]] and [[American English]].

In the [[Law of the United States|legal system of the United States]], a matter is '''moot''' if further legal proceedings with regard to it can have no effect, or events have placed it beyond the reach of the law.  Thereby the matter has been deprived of practical significance or rendered purely academic. The U.S. development of this word stems from the practice of [[moot court]]s, in which hypothetical or fictional cases were argued as a part of legal education.  These purely academic issues led the U.S. courts to describe cases where developing circumstances made any judgment ineffective as "moot".  The doctrine can be compared to the [[ripeness]] doctrine, another judge-made rule, that holds that judges should not rule on cases based entirely on anticipated disputes or hypothetical facts.  Similar doctrines prevent the federal courts of the United States from issuing [[advisory opinion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=matthew_hall |last1=Hall |first1=Mathew I |title=The Partially Prudential Doctrine of Mootness |volume=77 |work=George Washington Law Review |page=562 |date=August 2008 |publisher=[[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]], [[McGeorge School of Law]] |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is different from the usage in the [[Law of the United Kingdom|British legal system]], where the term "moot" has the meaning of "debatable". The shift in usage was first observed in the [[United States]].

==U.S. federal courts==
In the U.S. federal judicial system, a moot case must be dismissed, there being a constitutional limitation on the jurisdiction of the federal courts. The reason for this is that [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]] limits the jurisdiction of all federal courts to "[[cases and controversies]]". Thus, a civil action or appeal in which the court's decision will not affect the rights of the parties is ordinarily beyond the power of the court to decide, provided it does not fall within one of the recognized exceptions.

A textbook example of such a case is the [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[DeFunis v. Odegaard]]'', {{ussc|416|312|1974}}.  The plaintiff was a student who had been denied admission to [[law school]], and had then been provisionally admitted during the pendency of the case. Because the student was slated to graduate within a few months at the time the decision was rendered, and there was no action the law school could take to prevent that, the Court determined that a decision on its part would have no effect on the student's rights. Therefore, the case was dismissed as moot.

However, there is disagreement as to both the source of the standards, and their application in the courts.  Some courts and observers opine that cases ''must'' be dismissed because this is a constitutional bar, and there is no "case or controversy"; others have rejected the pure constitutional approach and adopted a so-called "prudential" view, where dismissal ''may'' depend upon a host of factors, whether the particular person has lost a viable interest in the case, or whether the issue itself survives outside the interests of the particular person, whether the circumstance are likely to recur, etc.  In actual practice, the U.S. federal courts have been uneven in their decisions, which has led to the accusation that determinations are ''[[ad hoc]]'' and 'result-oriented.'&lt;ref&gt;Hall, supra.{{page needed|date=August 2016}}{{nonspecific|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four major exceptions to this mootness rule. These are cases of "voluntary cessation" on the part of the [[defendant]]; questions that involve secondary or collateral legal consequences; questions that are "capable of ''repetition,'' yet evading review"; and questions involving [[class action]]s where the named party ceases to represent the class.

===Voluntary cessation===
Where a defendant is acting wrongfully, but ceases to engage in such conduct once a [[litigation]] has been threatened or commenced, the court will still not deem this correction to moot the case. Obviously, a party could stop acting improperly just long enough for the case to be dismissed and then resume the improper conduct. For example, in ''[[Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|528|167|2000}}, the Supreme Court held that an industrial polluter, against whom various deterrent civil penalties were being pursued, could not claim that the case was moot, even though the polluter had ceased polluting and had closed the factory responsible for the pollution. The court noted that so long as the polluter still retained its license to operate such a factory, it could open similar operations elsewhere if not deterred by the penalties sought.

Another example occurs when a court dismisses as "moot" a legal challenge to an existing law, where the law being challenged is either amended or repealed through legislation before the court case could be settled.  A recent instance of this occurred in ''[[Moore v. Madigan]],'' when Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan declined to appeal a ruling of the Seventh Circuit United States Court of Appeals striking down Illinois handgun carry ban to the [[United States Supreme Court]], as Illinois subsequently passed a law legalizing concealed carry with a state-issued license, which rendered the case moot.

===Secondary or collateral legal consequences===
"The obvious fact of life is that most criminal convictions do in fact entail adverse collateral legal consequences. The mere possibility that this will be the case is enough to preserve a criminal case from ending ignominiously in the limbo of mootness." Sibron v. New York.

===Capable of repetition, yet evading review===
A court will allow a case to go forward if it is the type for which persons will frequently be faced with a particular situation, but will likely cease to be in a position where the court can provide a remedy for them in the time that it takes for the justice system to address their situation. The most frequently cited example is the 1973 United States Supreme Court case of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', {{ussc|410|113|1973}}, which challenged a [[Texas]] law forbidding [[abortion]] in most circumstances. The state argued that the case was moot because plaintiff [[Norma McCorvey|Roe]] was no longer pregnant by the time the case was heard.  As [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]] wrote in the majority opinion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The normal 266-day human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete. If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. Our law should not be that rigid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Norma McCorvey, whose alias was Roe, became a [[pro-life]] advocate and attempted to have the decision of ''Roe v. Wade'' reversed and in ''[[McCorvey v. Hill]]'', 2004, the case failed to proceed based on being moot, without [[standing (law)|standing]] and out of time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Statute of limitations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court cited ''[[Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC]]'', {{ussc|219|498|1911}}, which had held that a case was not moot when it presented an issue that was "capable of repetition, yet evading review". Perhaps in response to increasing workloads at all levels of the judiciary, the recent trend in the Supreme Court and other U.S. courts has been to construe this exception rather narrowly.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Many cases fall under the "capable of repetition" doctrine; however, because there is a review process available under most circumstances, the exception to declaring mootness did not apply to such cases.  In ''Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft'', 436 U. S. 1, 8–9 (1978), the court noted that claims for [[damages]] save cases from mootness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-351.pdf |title=Slip: ''Alvarez v. Smith'' (2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class action representatives===
Where a class action lawsuit is brought, with one named plaintiff actually representing the interests of many others, the case will not become moot even if the named plaintiff ceases to belong to the class that is seeking a remedy. In ''[[Sosna v. Iowa]]'', {{ussc|419|393|1975}}, the plaintiff represented a class that was challenging an [[Iowa]] law that required persons to reside there for a year before seeking a [[divorce]] in Iowa's courts. The Supreme Court held that, although the plaintiff successfully divorced in another state, her [[Lawyer|attorneys]] could continue to competently advance the interests of other members of the class.

==U.S. state courts==
The [[U.S. state]] courts are not subject to the Article III limitations on their jurisdiction, and some state courts are permitted by their local constitutions and laws to render opinions in moot cases where the establishment of a legal precedent is desirable.  They may also establish exceptions to the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hawaiiopinions.blogspot.com/2008/10/prejudice-pushes-aside-mootness.html Prejudice Pushes Aside Mootness Doctrine Hamilton v. Lethem] (HSC October 14, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in some state courts the prosecution can lodge an appeal after a defendant is acquitted: although the appellate court cannot set aside a not-guilty verdict due to [[double jeopardy]], it can issue a ruling as to whether a trial court's ruling on a particular issue during the trial was erroneous. This opinion will then be binding on future cases heard by the courts of that state.

Some U.S. states also accept [[certified question]]s from the federal courts or the courts of other states. Under these procedures, state courts can issue opinions, usually for the purpose of clarifying or updating state law, in cases not actually pending in those courts.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Indiana Rules of Appellate Procedure, Title XI, Rule 64, "Certified Questions of State Law From Federal Courts".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside the U.S.==
Although free from the U.S. Constitutional limitation, Canada has recognized that considerations of judicial economy and [[comity]] with the legislative and executive branch may justify a decision to dismiss an allegedly moot case, as deciding hypothetical controversies is tantamount to legislating.  Considerations of the effectiveness of advocacy involved in the adversarial system and the possibility of recurrence of an alleged constitutional violation may sway the court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dj_4_H35nmYC&amp;pg=PA286 Morton, Frederick Lee, (March 2002) ''Law, politics, and the judicial process in Canada'' (BPR Publishers) 660pp.] {{ISBN|978-1-55238-046-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the federal and provincial governments can ask for advisory opinions in hypothetical scenarios, termed [[reference question]]s, from their respective highest courts.

==Moot point==
The phrase '''[[wikt:moot point|moot point]]''' refers (in American English) to an issue that is irrelevant to a subject being discussed or, in British English, one that is debatable. Due to the relatively uncommon usage of the word moot, and because "moot" and "mute" are [[homophone]]s in some pronunciations, this is sometimes erroneously rendered as "mute point".&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/mute.html Mute Point/Moot Point], from Paul Brians, ''Common Errors in English Usage'' (3rd Edition), William, James Co. November, 2013 (retrieved April 16 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2946">A '''moral imperative''' is a strongly-felt principle that compels that person to act. It is a kind of [[categorical imperative]], as defined by [[Immanuel Kant]].  Kant took the imperative to be a dictate of [[pure reason]], in its practical aspect. Not following the moral law was seen to be self-defeating and thus contrary to reason.  Later thinkers took the imperative to originate in conscience, as the divine voice speaking through the human spirit.  The dictates of conscience are simply right and often resist further justification.  Looked at another way, the experience of conscience is the basic experience of encountering the right.

An example of not following a moral imperative is making a promise that you do not intend to keep in order to get something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kant's Moral Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Economic Moral imperative ==
[[Toby Ord]] Explores a moral imperative driven by a utilitarian view in relation to  economics and global health. A hypothetical example he gives is that a group has $40,000 dollars to spend on blindness. The money could be spent to provide one U.S. person with a seeing eye dog and training or could be used to reverse the effects of 2,000 cases of trachoma in Africa through surgery. The utilitarian answer would be to help more people.

Toby also provides some real-world examples. Some real-world examples provide data on the cost to prevent or treat AIDS. Analyzing the cost-effectiveness of these methods of treatment and prevention is a moral imperative because the most effective use of funds can save more lives.&lt;ref name=toby&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ord|first1=Toby|title=The moral imperative towards cost-effectiveness|url=https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/moral_imperative.pdf|website=www.givingwhatwecan.org|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary Locke]] and [[José Ángel Gurría|Angel Gurria]] stated cases for economic moral imperatives related to corruption and anti-bribery laws. Water provides 40 percent of the world's food requirement and in developing countries there can be a 30 percent premium on water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Gary Locke|author2=Angel Gurría|title=A Global Economic and Moral Imperative|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sec-gary-locke/a-global-economic-and-mor_b_388009.html|website=www.huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=6 February 2015|date=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Thomas Pogge]] argues that this corruption is strongly encouraged by the existing international rules as the rulers of these countries have much to gain from these larger countries and corporations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19237">'''Natural genetic engineering''' (NGE) is a class of process proposed by molecular biologist [[James A. Shapiro|James Shapiro]] to account for novelty created in the course of biological evolution. Shapiro developed this work in several peer-reviewed publications from 1992 onwards, and later in his 2011 book '''''Evolution: A View from the 21st Century'''''&lt;!--redirects here--&gt;. He uses NGE to account for several proposed counterexamples to the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] (the subsequently partly rejected proposal of 1970 that the direction of the flow of sequence information is only from DNA to DNA or DNA to RNA to proteins, and never the reverse). Shapiro drew from work as diverse as the adaptivity of the mammalian immune system, [[ciliate]] [[Macronucleus|macronuclei]] and [[epigenetics]]. The work gained some measure of notoriety after being championed by proponents of [[Intelligent Design]], despite Shapiro's explicit repudiation of that movement.

==Concept==
Shapiro first laid out his ideas of natural genetic engineering in 1992&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1992" /&gt; and has continued to develop them in both the primary scientific literature&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1999b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2002" /&gt; and in work directed to wider audiences,&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007" /&gt; culminating in the 2011 publication of ''Evolution: A View from the 21st Century''.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2011" /&gt;

Natural genetic engineering is a reaction against the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] and the [[central dogma of molecular biology]]. The modern synthesis was formulated before the elucidation of the double-helix structure of [[DNA]] and the establishment of [[molecular biology]] in its current status of prominence. Given what was known at the time a simple, powerful model of genetic change through undirected mutation (loosely described as "[[Randomness|random]]") and natural selection, was seen as sufficient to explain evolution as observed in nature. With the discovery of the nature and roles of [[nucleic acid]]s in genetics, this model prompted [[Francis Crick]]'s so-called Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: "[Sequential] information cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid."&lt;ref name="crick1958"&gt;Crick, F.H.C. (1958): [http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/F/T/_/scbbft.pdf On Protein Synthesis.] Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. XII, 139-163. (pdf, early draft of original article)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crick1970"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crick | first1 = F | title = Central dogma of molecular biology. | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/crick/pdf/crick227.pdf | pmid = 4913914  |name-list-format=vanc | journal = Nature | doi=10.1038/227561a0 | volume=227 | issue=5258 | pages = 561–3 |date=August 1970 | bibcode=1970Natur.227..561C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro points out that multiple cellular systems can affect DNA in response to specific environmental stimuli.  These "directed" changes stand in contrast to both the undirected mutations in the modern synthesis and (in Shapiro's interpretation) the ban on information flowing from the environment into the genome.

In the 1992 ''[[Genetica]]'' paper that introduced the concept, Shapiro begins by listing three lessons from molecular genetics:
* there is a surprising amount of genetic conservation across taxonomic boundaries,
* the mosaic structure of the genome results in multiple nonlocal genes having multiple phylogenic effects, and, drawing on the work of his friend and collaborator [[Barbara McClintock]],
* the existence of multiple cellular mechanisms (including [[mobile genetic elements]]) that can restructure DNA.
From these, Shapiro concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[I]t can be argued that much of genome change in evolution results from a genetic engineering process utilizing the biochemical systems for mobilizing and reorganizing DNA structures present in living cells.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1992" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Relation with Intelligent Design==
In a 1997 [[Boston Review]] article, Shapiro lists
four categories of discoveries made in molecular biology that, in his
estimation, are not adequately accounted for by the [[Modern_synthesis_(20th_century)|Modern Synthesis]]:  [[genome]] organization, [[DNA repair|cellular repair]] capabilities, [[mobile genetic elements]] and cellular information processing.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1997 Third Way" /&gt;  Shapiro concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What significance does an emerging interface between biology and information
science hold for thinking about evolution? It opens up the possibility of
addressing scientifically rather than ideologically the central issue so hotly
contested by fundamentalists on both sides of the Creationist-Darwinist debate:
Is there any guiding intelligence at work in the origin of species displaying
exquisite adaptations that range from lambda prophage repression and the Krebs
cycle through the mitotic apparatus and the eye to the immune system, mimicry,
and social organization?&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1997 Third Way" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within the context of the article in particular and Shapiro's work on Natural
Genetic Engineering in general, the "guiding intelligence" is to be found
within the cell.  (For example, in a [[Huffington Post]] essay entitled
[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-a-shapiro/cell-cognition_b_1354889.html Cell Cognition and Cell Decision-Making]&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2012a" /&gt; Shapiro
defines cognitive actions as those that are "knowledge-based and involve decisions appropriate
to acquired information," arguing that cells meet this criteria.)  However,
the combination of disagreement with the Modern Synthesis and discussion of
a creative intelligence has brought his work to the attention of advocates
of [[Intelligent Design]].

Natural genetic engineering has been cited as a legitimate scientific controversy (in contrast to the controversies raised by various branches of [[creationism]]).&lt;ref name="Koperski 2008" /&gt;  While Shapiro considers the questions raised by Intelligent Design to be interesting, he parts ways with creationists by considering these problems to be scientifically tractable (specifically by understanding how NGE plays a role in the evolution of novelty).&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2002" /&gt;

With the publication of ''Evolution:  A View from the 21st Century'',
Shapiro's work again came under discussion in the Intelligent design community.
In a conversation with Shapiro, [[William Dembski]] asked for Shapiro's
thoughts on the origins of natural genetic engineering systems.  Shapiro replied that "where they come from in the first place is not a question we can realistically answer right now."&lt;ref name="Dembski 2012" /&gt;
While Dembski sees this position as at least not inconsistent with Intelligent
Design, Shapiro has explicitly and repeatedly rejected both creationism in
general&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2012b"/&gt; and Intelligent Design in particular.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2012c" /&gt;

==Criticism==

While Shapiro developed NGE in the peer-reviewed literature, the idea attracted far more attention when he summarized his work in his book ''Evolution:  A View from the 21st Century''.
&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2011" /&gt; In part due to its discussion of the Intelligent Design movement, the book was widely and critically reviewed.&lt;ref name="Moran 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seoighe 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bezak 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penny 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkins 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buratti 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yu 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ussery 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kutschera 2012" /&gt;  Criticism falls into two main categories:

:#  ''The theory crosses the line into [[teleology]]'', a line exemplified by the review written by Larry Moran.&lt;ref name="Moran 2011" /&gt;  The form of Shapiro's argument has points of resemblance to several creationist arguments to the effect that observed biology cannot be explained by a combination of "random" (undirected) mutation and natural selection.  One of the many standard responses to these arguments is that biology can be sufficiently explained without invoking higher causes.  Shapiro's view differs significantly from that of creationists, not the least because his higher causes exist only at the level of cellular machinery.  However, to a critic unpersuaded of the need for higher causes, it is not persuasive to substitute material higher causes for the supernatural.
:#  ''Shapiro does not give a fair reading of the central dogma.''  Shapiro's reading of the central dogma requires that ''only'' random mutations can be the root of evolutionary change.  If this reading is correct, then, ignoring the looseness of such an application of the term "[[Randomness|random]]", the several mechanisms identified by Shapiro (''e.g.'', [[epigenetics]]) do indeed falsify this theory.  However, Crick and geneticists in general had long been well aware of the existence of mutagens at the time of the formulation and restatement of the central dogma, and in fact before the discovery of the mechanisms of biological heredity.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Thomas Hunt. The mechanism of Mendelian heredity  New York, Holt, 1915 [https://archive.org/details/mechanismmendel00morggoog]&lt;/ref&gt;  A more conservative interpretation, in the words of [[Marshall Nirenberg]], is simply that "DNA makes RNA makes protein."&lt;ref name="Nirenberg" /&gt;  Under this reading, proteins would not be expected to modify DNA, but Shapiro provides multiple examples of where this occurs, including [[histone modification]], mutagenic subclasses of [[DNA repair|excision and repair enzymes]], extensive regulation of mobile genetic elements, and various classes of RNA regulation, and direct modification of nucleotides via [[cytosine methylation]] and [[Cytosine deaminase|enzymatic deamination]].&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2013" /&gt;

Shapiro responded to the review in ''Evolutionary Intelligence''.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2012" /&gt;

In [[computer programming]] and [[software engineering]], the '''ninety-ninety rule''' is a humorous [[aphorism]] that states:

{{quote |text=&lt;!-- PLEASE DON'T CHANGE THIS QUOTE WITHOUT CHECKING THE ORIGINAL SOURCE! THE %'S ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO TOTAL 100%! --&gt;The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90&lt;!-- YES THIS TOTALS 180%! THIS IS NOT AN ERROR! --&gt; percent of the development time.&lt;ref name="Bentley1985"/&gt; |sign=[[Tom Cargill]] |source=[[Bell Labs]]}}

This adds up to 180%, in a wry allusion to the notoriety of software development projects significantly over-running their schedules (see [[software development effort estimation]]). It expresses both the rough allocation of time to easy and hard portions of a programming project and the cause of the lateness of many projects as failure to anticipate the hard parts. In other words, it takes both more time and more coding than expected to complete a project.

The rule is attributed to Tom Cargill of [[Bell Labs]] and was made popular by [[Jon Bentley (computer scientist)|Jon Bentley's]] September 1985 "Programming Pearls" column in ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'', in which it was titled the "Rule of Credibility".&lt;ref name="Bentley1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bentley|first=Jon|year=1985|title=Programming pearls: Bumper-Sticker Computer Science|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=28|issue=9|pages=896–901|issn=0001-0782|doi=10.1145/4284.315122|format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Agile software development|agile software projects]], this rule also surfaces when a task is portrayed as "relatively done". This indicates a common scenario where planned work is completed but cannot be signed off, pending a single final activity which may not occur for a substantial amount of time.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Objections to evolution''' have been raised since [[History of evolutionary thought|evolutionary ideas]] came to prominence in the 19th century. When [[Charles Darwin]] published his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', his theory of [[evolution]] (the idea that [[species]] arose through [[common descent|descent with modification from a single common ancestor]] in a process driven by [[natural selection]]) initially met opposition from [[scientist]]s with [[Alternatives to Darwinism|different theories]], but eventually came to receive [[Level of support for evolution#Scientific support|overwhelming acceptance]] in the [[scientific community]]. The observation of evolutionary processes occurring (as well as the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]] explaining that evidence) has been uncontroversial among mainstream [[biologist]]s since the 1940s.

Since then, most criticisms and denials of evolution have come from [[Religion|religious]] groups, rather than from the scientific community. Although many religious groups have found reconciliation of their beliefs with evolution, such as through [[theistic evolution]], other religious groups continue to reject evolutionary explanations in favor of [[creationism]], the belief that the universe and life were created by [[supernatural]] forces. The [[United States|U.S.]]-centered [[creation–evolution controversy]] has become a focal point of perceived conflict between [[relationship between religion and science|religion and science]].

Several branches of creationism, including [[creation science]], [[neo-creationism]], and [[intelligent design]], argue that the idea of life being directly designed by a [[god]] or intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in [[creation and evolution in public education|public education]]. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's [[scientific evidence|evidence]], [[methodology]], plausibility, [[morality]], and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the [[scientific method]], evidence, and basic [[physical law]]s.

==History==
{{further|History of evolutionary thought|History of creationism|Creation–evolution controversy}}
[[File:Charles Darwin seated crop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] gained widespread acceptance as a description of the origin of species, but there was continued resistance to his views on the significance of [[natural selection]] as the mechanism of evolution.]]

Evolutionary ideas came to prominence in the early 19th century with the theory of the [[transmutation of species]] put forward by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]].  Evolution was at first opposed among the scientific community, notably by [[Georges Cuvier]], and religious grounds.&lt;ref name="icj"&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=Ian C. |year=1999 |chapter=Section Three: The Origins of Evolutionary Theory |chapterurl=http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/darwin/sect3.htm |title=. . .

When Charles Darwin published his 1859 book ''On the Origin of Species'', he convinced most of the scientific community that new species arise through descent through modification in a branching pattern of divergence from [[common descent|common ancestors]], but while most scientists accepted that natural selection is a valid and [[Empirical evidence|empirical]]ly testable [[hypothesis]], Darwin's view that it is the primary mechanism of evolution was rejected by some.&lt;ref name=darwin-online-2002-van-wyhe-complete /&gt;

Darwin's contemporaries eventually came to accept the transmutation of species based upon [[fossil]] evidence, and the [[X Club]] was formed to defend evolution against the church and wealthy amateurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutdarwin.com/timeline/November.html |title=Darwin's Timeline: November |date=February 10, 2008 |website=AboutDarwin.com |publisher=David Leff |location=Eugene, OR |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the specific evolutionary mechanism which Darwin provided of [[natural selection]] was actively disputed by scientists in favour of alternative theories such as [[Lamarckism]] and [[orthogenesis]]. Darwin's [[gradualism|gradualistic]] account was also opposed by [[saltation (biology)|saltationism]] and [[catastrophism]]. [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] led scientific opposition to gradualism on the basis of his thermodynamic calculations that the [[Earth]] was [[Age of the Earth|between 24 and 400 million years old]], and own views favoured a version of theistic evolution accelerated by divine guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1992|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This age of the earth was disputed by geological estimates, which gained strength in 1907 when radioactive dating of rocks showed that the Earth was billions of years old.&lt;ref name="England et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=England |first1=Philip |authorlink1=Philip England |last2=Molnar |first2=Peter |last3=Righter |first3=Frank |date=January 2007 |title=John Perry's neglected critique of Kelvin's age for the Earth: A missed opportunity in geodynamics |journal=GSA Today |location=Boulder, CO |publisher=[[Geological Society of America]] |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=4–9 |doi=10.1130/GSAT01701A.1 |issn=1052-5173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boltwood"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boltwood |first=Bertram B. |authorlink=Bertram Boltwood |date=February 1907 |title=On the Ultimate Disintegration Products of the Radio-Active Elements.

Although evolution was unchallenged, uncertainties about the mechanism in [[the eclipse of Darwinism]] persisted from the 1880s until the 1930s &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1992|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; inclusion of [[Mendelian inheritance]] and the rise of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]. The modern synthesis rose to universal acceptance among biologists with the help of new evidence, such as [[genetics]], which confirmed Darwin's predictions and refuted the competing theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protestantism]], especially in America, broke out in "acrid polemics" and argument about evolution from 1860 to the 1870s—with the turning point possibly marked by the death of [[Louis Agassiz]] in 1873—and by 1880 a form of "[[Christian]] evolution" was becoming the consensus.&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1979|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, while publication of ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' by Darwin in 1871 reinvigorated debate from the previous decade, [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Sir Henry Chadwick]] notes a steady acceptance of evolution "among more educated Christians" between 1860 and 1885. As a result, evolutionary theory was "both permissible and respectable" by 1876.&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; [[Frederick Temple]]'s lectures on ''The Relations between Religion and Science'' (1884) on how evolution was not "antagonistic" to religion highlighted this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Temple|1884|loc=Lecture IV: [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17194/17194-h/17194-h.htm#LECTURE_IV "Apparent Conflict Between Religion and the Doctrine of Evolution"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple's appointment as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1896 demonstrated the broad acceptance of evolution within the church hierarchy.&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt;

For decades the [[Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] avoided official refutation of evolution. However, it would rein in Catholics who proposed that evolution could be reconciled with the [[Bible]], as this conflicted with the [[First Vatican Council]]'s (1869–70) finding that everything was created [[Ex nihilo|out of nothing]] by God, and to deny that finding could lead to [[excommunication]]. In 1950, the [[Encyclical#Catholic usage|encyclical]] ''[[Humani generis]]'' of [[Pope Pius XII]] first mentioned evolution directly and officially.&lt;ref name=vatican-1950-08-12-pope-pius-xii /&gt; It allowed one to enquire into the concept of [[human]]s coming from pre-existing living matter, but not to question [[Adam and Eve]] or the creation of the [[soul]]. In 1996, [[Pope John Paul II]] said that evolution is "more than a hypothesis" and acknowledged the large body of work accumulated in its support, but reiterated that any attempt to give a material explanation of the human soul is "incompatible with the truth about man."&lt;ref name=caltech-1996-10-30-pope-john-paul-ii /&gt; Pope Benedict XVI has reiterated the conviction that human beings "are not some casual and meaningless product of evolution. Each of us is the result of a thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of us is loved, each of us is necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/homilies/2005/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20050424_inizio-pontificato.html|title=24 April 2005: Mass for the inauguration of the Pontificate {{!}} BENEDICT XVI|website=w2.vatican.va|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he has promoted the study of the relationship between the concepts of creation and evolution, based on the conviction that there cannot be a contradiction between faith and reason.&lt;ref&gt;See John Allen's essay at https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/all-things-catholic/benedicts-thinking-creation-and-evolution. See also Christoph Cardinal Schönborn's exposition "Benedict XVI. on 'Creation and Evolution'": http://www.pas.va/content/dam/accademia/pdf/acta20/acta20-schoenbornen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, the research project Thomistic Evolution, run by a team of [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] scholars, endeavours to reconcile the scientific evidence on evolution with the teaching of Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thomisticevolution.org/|title=Thomistic Evolution|website=www.thomisticevolution.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muslim]] reaction ranged from those believing in literal creation from the [[Quran]] to many educated Muslims who subscribed to a version of theistic or guided evolution in which the Quran reinforced rather than contradicted mainstream science. This occurred relatively early, as medieval [[madrasa]]hs taught the ideas of [[Al-Jahiz]], a Muslim scholar from the 9th century, who proposed concepts similar to natural selection.&lt;ref name=hssrd-2002-summer-majid /&gt; However, acceptance of evolution remains low in the Muslim world, as prominent figures reject evolution's underpinning [[philosophy]] of [[materialism]] as unsound to human origins and a denial of [[Allah]].&lt;ref name=hssrd-2002-summer-majid /&gt; Further objections by Muslim authors and writers largely reflect those put forward in the [[Western world]].&lt;ref name="EvoDeceit"&gt;{{harvnb|Yahya|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of acceptance from major religious hierarchies, early religious objections to Darwin's theory are still used in opposition to evolution. The ideas that species change over time through natural processes and that different species share common ancestors seemed to contradict the [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis account of Creation]]. Believers in [[Biblical infallibility]] attacked [[Darwinism]] as heretical. The [[natural theology]] of the early 19th century was typified by [[William Paley]]'s [[watchmaker analogy]], an [[teleological argument|argument from design]] still used by the creationist movement. Natural theology included a range of ideas and arguments from the outset, and when Darwin's theory was published, ideas of theistic evolution were presented in which evolution is accepted as a secondary cause open to scientific investigation, while still holding belief in God as a first cause with a non-specified role in guiding evolution and creating humans.&lt;ref name=Darwin&amp;design&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |title=Darwin and design |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=[[Correspondence of Charles Darwin#Darwin Correspondence Project website|Darwin Correspondence Project]] |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]; [[American Council of Learned Societies]] |location=Cambridge, UK |accessdate=2015-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327005203/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |archivedate=2015-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This position has been adopted by denominations of [[Christianity]] and [[Jewish views on evolution|Judaism]] in line with [[Liberal Christianity|modernist theology]] which views the Bible and [[Torah]] as allegorical, thus removing the conflict between evolution and religion.

However, in the 1920s [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] in the [[United States]] developed their [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] arguments against modernist theology into opposition to the teaching of evolution, with fears that Darwinism had led to German militarism and was a threat to religion and morality. This opposition developed into the creation–evolution controversy involving Christian literalists in the United States objecting to the teaching of evolution in [[State school#United States|public school]]s. Although early objectors dismissed evolution as contradicting their interpretation of the Bible, this argument was legally invalidated when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' in 1968 that forbidding the teaching of evolution on religious grounds violated the [[Establishment Clause]].&lt;ref name="SM07"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink1=Eugenie Scott |last2=Matzke |first2=Nicholas J. |authorlink2=Nick Matzke |date=May 15, 2007 |title=Biological design in science classrooms |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proc.

Since then creationists have developed more nuanced objections to evolution, alleging variously that it is unscientific, infringes on creationists' [[freedom of religion|religious freedoms]], or that the acceptance of evolution is a religious stance.&lt;ref name="ham"&gt;{{harvnb|Ham|1987|loc=Chapter 2: [http://www.creationists.org/evolutionism-is-a-religion.html "Evolution is Religion"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists have appealed to democratic principles of fairness, arguing that evolution is controversial and that science classrooms should therefore "[[Teach the Controversy]]."&lt;ref name="wedge" /&gt; These objections to evolution culminated in the [[intelligent design movement]] in the 1990s and early 2000s that [[Kitzmiller v.

==Defining evolution==
{{further|Evolution (term)}}

One of the main sources of confusion and ambiguity in the creation–evolution debate is the definition of ''evolution'' itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different meanings in different fields, from [[evolutionary computation]] to [[molecular evolution]] to [[sociocultural evolution]] to [[stellar evolution|stellar]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galactic evolution]]. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about [[abiogenesis]] or the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name=talkorigins-1993-1-22-moran-definition /&gt;

{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Biston.betularia.7200.jpg |image2=Biston.betularia.f.carbonaria.7209.jpg|width=200| caption1=White [[peppered moth]] |caption2=Black morph in [[peppered moth evolution]]. Even minor variation in a population can lead to evolution by natural selection.}}

''Evolution'' in colloquial contexts can refer to any sort of progressive development or gradual improvement, and a process that results in greater quality or complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evolution| title = Definition of Evolution| publisher = merriam-webster.com| access-date = 4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When misapplied to biological evolution this common meaning leads to frequent misunderstandings. For example, the idea of [[Devolution (biology)|devolution]] ("backwards" evolution) is a result of erroneously assuming that evolution is directional or has a specific goal in mind (cf. orthogenesis). In reality, the evolution of an organism has no "objective" and is only showing increasing ability of successive generations to survive and reproduce in its environment; and increased suitability is only defined in relation to this environment. Biologists do not consider any one species, such as humans, to be more ''highly evolved'' or ''advanced'' than another. Certain sources have been criticized for indicating otherwise due to a tendency to evaluate nonhuman organisms according to [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] standards rather than more objective ones.&lt;ref name="devolving"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dougherty |first=Michael J. |date=July 20, 1998 |title=Is the human race evolving or devolving? |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-the-human-race-evolvin/ |journal=[[Scientific American]] |location=Stuttgart |publisher=[[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]] |issn=0036-8733 |accessdate=2015-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolution also does not require that organisms become more complex. Although the [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|history of life]] shows an apparent trend towards the [[evolution of biological complexity]]; there is a question if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or if it comes from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on Earth has always consisted of [[prokaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carroll |first=Sean B. |authorlink=Sean B. Carroll |date=February 22, 2001 |title=Chance and necessity: the evolution of morphological complexity and diversity |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |location=London |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |volume=409 |issue=6823 |pages=1102–1109 |doi=10.1038/35059227 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=11234024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but that specific circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus [[natural selection|naturally selected]] for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.&lt;ref name="devolving" /&gt;

Creationist sources frequently define evolution according to a colloquial, rather than scientific, meaning. As a result, many attempts to rebut evolution do not address the findings of [[evolutionary biology]] (see [[Straw man|straw man argument]]). This also means that advocates of creationism and [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]]s often simply speak past each other.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-1993-1-22-moran-definition /&gt;

==Scientific acceptance==

===Status as a theory===
{{further|Evolution as fact and theory}}

Critics of evolution assert that evolution is "just a theory," which emphasizes that scientific theories are never absolute, or misleadingly presents it as a matter of opinion rather than of fact or evidence.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-1993-1-22-moran-fact /&gt; This reflects a difference of the meaning of ''[[theory]]'' in a scientific context: whereas in colloquial speech a ''theory'' is a conjecture or guess, in [[scientific theory|science a theory]] is an explanation whose predictions have been verified by experiments or other evidence. ''Evolutionary theory'' refers to an explanation for the diversity of species and their ancestry which has met extremely high standards of scientific evidence. An example of evolution as theory is the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of Darwinian natural selection and Mendelian inheritance. As with any scientific theory, the modern synthesis is constantly debated, tested, and refined by scientists, but there is an overwhelming consensus in the scientific community that it remains the only robust model that accounts for the known facts concerning evolution.&lt;ref name=aaas-2006-2-16-statement-teaching-evolution /&gt;

Critics also state that evolution is not a [[fact]].&lt;ref name="MentonFact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mall.turnpike.net/C/cs/theory.htm |title=Is Evolution a Theory, a Fact, or a Law? |last=Menton |first=David N. |year=1993 |work=Missouri Association for Creation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914223848/http://mall.turnpike.net/C/cs/theory.htm |archivedate=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2010-06-16}} "Originally published in: St. Louis MetroVoice, October 1993, Vol. 3, No. 10"&lt;/ref&gt; In science a fact is a verified empirical observation while in colloquial contexts a fact can simply refer to anything for which there is overwhelming evidence. For example, in common usage theories such as "[[Heliocentrism|the Earth revolves around the Sun]]" and "objects fall due to gravity" may be referred to as "facts," even though they are purely theoretical. From a scientific standpoint, therefore, evolution may be called a "fact" for the same reason that gravity can: under the scientific definition, evolution is an observable process that occurs whenever a population of organisms genetically changes over time. Under the colloquial definition, the theory of evolution can also be called a fact, referring to this theory's well-established nature. Thus, evolution is widely considered [[Evolution as fact and theory|both a theory and a fact]] by scientists.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-1993-1-22-moran-fact /&gt;&lt;ref name=talkorigins-2003-10-1-faq-misconceptions-isaak /&gt;&lt;ref name="gouldfact"&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1983|pp=253–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/lenski.html |title=Evolution: Fact and Theory |last=Lenski |first=Richard E. |authorlink=Richard Lenski |date=September 2000 |website=actionbioscience |publisher=[[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar confusion is involved in objections that evolution is "unproven," since no theory in science is known to be absolutely true, only verified by [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref name=icr-morris /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is an important one in [[philosophy of science]], as it relates to the lack of absolute [[certainty]] in all empirical claims, not just evolution. Strict [[proof theory|proof]] is possible only in [[formal science]]s such as logic and mathematics, not [[natural science]]s (where terms such as "validated" or "corroborated" are more appropriate). Thus, to say that evolution is not proven is trivially true, but no more an indictment of evolution than calling it a "theory." The confusion arises in that the colloquial meaning of ''proof'' is simply "compelling evidence," in which case scientists would indeed consider evolution "proven."&lt;ref name="Theobald"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/sciproof.html |title=Scientific 'Proof', scientific evidence, and the scientific method |last=Theobald |first=Douglas |work=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: The Scientific Case for Common Descent |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}} Version 2.89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degree of acceptance===
{{further|Level of support for evolution}}

An objection is often made in the [[Creation and evolution in public education in the United States#Kansas|teaching of evolution]] that evolution is controversial or contentious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ratliff |first=Evan |authorlink=Evan Ratliff |date=October 2004 |title=The Crusade Against Evolution |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/evolution.html?pg=2 |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |issue=12.10 |issn=1059-1028 |accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="equal" /&gt;  Unlike past creationist arguments which sought to abolish the teaching of evolution altogether, this argument makes the weaker claim that evolution should be presented alongside alternative views since it is controversial, and students should be allowed to evaluate and choose between the options on their own.&lt;ref name="equal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA040.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CA040: Equal time |date=September 25, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Meyer |first=Stephen C. |authorlink=Stephen C.

This objection forms the basis of the "[[Teach the Controversy]]" campaign by the [[Discovery Institute]], a [[think tank]] based in Seattle, Washington, to promote the teaching of intelligent design in U.S. public schools.  This goal followed the Institute's "[[wedge strategy]]," an attempt to gradually undermine evolution and ultimately to "reverse the stifling dominance of the  [[materialism|materialist]] worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions."&lt;ref name="wedge"&gt;A copy of the [[Discovery Institute]]'s ''[[wedge strategy]]'' document can be found here: {{cite web |url=http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf |title=The Wedge |year=1999 |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-24}} pg 6 Five Year Strategic Plan Summary end of para 1 "We are building on this momentum, broadening the wedge with a positive scientific alternative to materialistic scientific theories, which has come to be called the theory of intelligent design (ID). Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions."&lt;/ref&gt; Several other attempts were made to insert intelligent design or creationism into the U.S. public school curriculum, including the failed [[Santorum Amendment]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost-2005-8-2-gwb /&gt;

Scientists and U.S. courts have rejected this objection on the grounds that science is not based on [[Argumentum ad populum|appeals to popularity]], but on evidence. The [[scientific consensus]] of biologists determines what is considered acceptable science, not popular opinion or fairness, and although evolution is controversial in the public arena, it is entirely uncontroversial among experts in the field.&lt;ref name="scott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IAP_2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interacademies.net/10878/13901.aspx |title=IAP Statement on the Teaching of Evolution |author=IAP Member Academies |date=June 21, 2006 |website=[[InterAcademy Panel|IAP]] |publisher=[[TWAS|The World Academy of Sciences]] |location=Trieste, Italy |accessdate=2015-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, creationists have disputed the level of scientific [[Level of support for evolution|support for evolution]]. The Discovery Institute has gathered over 761 scientists as of August 2008 to sign ''[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]]'' in order to show that there are a number of scientists who dispute what they refer to as "Darwinian evolution." This statement did not profess outright disbelief in evolution, but expressed skepticism as to the ability of "random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life." Several counter-petitions have been launched in turn, including ''[[A Scientific Support for Darwinism]]'', which gathered over 7,000 signatures in four days,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Ask Science |first=Kenneth |last= Chang |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 21, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/science/ask-science.html |accessdate=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Project Steve]], a tongue-in-cheek petition that has gathered the signatures of 1,393 (as of May 24, 2016) evolution-supporting scientists named "Steve" (or any similar variation thereof—Stephen, Stephanie, Esteban, etc.).&lt;ref name="PS1200"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2012/04/project-steve-n-1200-007293 |title=Project Steve: n &gt; 1200 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=April 6, 2012 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |location=Oakland, CA |accessdate=May 24, 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creationists have argued for over a century that evolution is a "theory in crisis" that will soon be overturned, based on objections that it lacks reliable evidence or violates natural laws. These objections have been rejected by most scientists, as have claims that intelligent design, or any other creationist explanation, meets the basic scientific standards that would be required to make them scientific alternatives to evolution. It is also argued that even if evidence against evolution exists, it is a [[false dilemma]] to characterize this as evidence ''for'' intelligent design.&lt;ref name=entouch-2002-morton-imminent-demise /&gt;

A similar objection to evolution is that certain scientific authorities—mainly pre-modern ones—have doubted or rejected evolution.&lt;ref name="creationsafaris4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creationsafaris.com/wgcs_4.htm |title=Shining Through Materialistic Darkness |last=Coppedge |first=David F. |year=2000 |work=The World's Greatest Creation Scientists: From Y1K to Y2K |publisher=CreationSafaris.com |location=Chesterbrook, PA |accessdate=2010-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624225502/http://www.creationsafaris.com/wgcs_4.htm |archive-date=2016-06-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, it is argued that Darwin "recanted" on his deathbed, a false anecdote originating from [[Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope|Lady Hope's story]].&lt;ref name="ChristianAnswers.Net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/darwin.html |title=Was Darwin a Christian?

==Scientific status==
A common neo-creationist objection to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that it is not genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the [[scientific method]] and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with the very nature of evolutionary theory, the scientific method, and [[philosophy of science]].

===Religious nature===
{{further|Relationship between religion and science|Scientism}}

Creationists commonly argue that "evolution is a religion; it is not a science."&lt;ref name="ham" /&gt; The purpose of this criticism is to reframe the debate from one between science (evolution) and religion (creationism) to between two religious beliefs—or even to argue that evolution is religious while intelligent design is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dembski|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="notscience"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morris |first=Henry M. |authorlink=Henry M.

The arguments for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by [[analogy]]: it is argued that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on [[faith]],&lt;ref name=icr-morris /&gt; and that supporters of evolution [[dogma]]tically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiker |first=Benjamin D. |authorlink=Benjamin Wiker |date=July–August 2003 |title=Part II: The Christian Critics — Does Science Point to God? |url=http://www.crisismagazine.com/2003/part-ii-the-christian-critics-does-science-point-to-god |journal=Crisis Magazine |publisher=Morley Publishing Group |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of evolution have argued in response that no scientist's claims are treated as sacrosanct, as shown by the aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists over the years to form first [[neo-Darwinism]] and later the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA611.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CA611: Evolution Sacrosanct? |date=February 15, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kutschera |first1=Ulrich |authorlink1=Ulrich Kutschera |last2=Niklas |first2=Karl J. |authorlink2=Karl J.

The argument that evolution is religious has been rejected in general on the grounds that ''religion'' is not defined by how dogmatic or zealous its adherents are, but by its spiritual or supernatural beliefs. Evolutionary supporters point out evolution is neither dogmatic nor based on faith, and they accuse creationists of [[equivocation|equivocating]] between the strict definition of ''religion'' and its colloquial usage to refer to anything that is enthusiastically or dogmatically engaged in. United States courts have also rejected this objection:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Assuming for the purposes of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it. Yet it is clearly established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate the Establishment Clause, [[Epperson v. Arkansas]], supra, [[Willoughby v. Stever]], No. 15574-75 (D.D.C. May 18, 1973); aff'd. 504 F.2d 271 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert. denied , 420 U.S. 924 (1975); [[Wright v.

A related claim is that evolution is [[Atheism|atheistic]] (see the [[#Atheism|Atheism]] section below); creationists sometimes merge the two claims and describe evolution as an "atheistic religion" (cf. [[humanism]]).&lt;ref name="notscience" /&gt; This argument against evolution is also frequently generalized into a criticism of all science; it is argued that "science is an atheistic religion," on the grounds that its [[naturalism (philosophy)#Methodological naturalism|methodological naturalism]] is as unproven, and thus as "faith-based," as the supernatural and theistic beliefs of creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismscienceevolution/a/ScienceFaith.htm |title=Myth: Science is a Religion for Atheists that Requires Faith |last=Cline |first=Austin |year=2006 |website=[[About.com]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |location=New York |accessdate=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unfalsifiability{{anchor|Evolution is unfalsifiable}}===
A statement is considered [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] if there is an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the statement is false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as [[Henry M. Morris]] have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.&lt;ref name="CA211"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA211.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CA211: Evolution falsifiable |date=March 3, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1974|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of evolution argue that evolution could be falsified by many conceivable lines of evidence, such as the [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] showing no change over time, confirmation that mutations are prevented from accumulating in a population, or observation of organisms being created supernaturally or spontaneously.&lt;ref name="CA211" /&gt; [[J.

The fusion hypothesis was confirmed in 2005 by discovery that [[Chromosome 2 (human)|human chromosome 2]] is homologous with a fusion of two chromosomes that remain separate in other [[primate]]s. Extra, inactive [[telomere]]s and [[centromere]]s remain on human chromosome 2 as a result of the fusion.&lt;ref name="pbslearningmedia-2007-human-chromosome-2" /&gt; The assertion of common descent could also have been disproven with the invention of [[DNA sequencing]] methods. If true, human [[DNA]] should be far more similar to chimpanzees and other great apes, than to other [[mammal]]s. If not, then common descent is falsified. DNA analysis has shown that humans and chimpanzees share a large percentage of their DNA (between 95% to 99.4% depending on the measure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3744-chimps-are-human-gene-study-implies.html|title=Chimps are human, gene study implies|last=Hecht|first=Jeff|date=May 19, 2003|work=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|location=London|issn=0262-4079}}

In 1976, the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] said that "Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory but a metaphysical research programme."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later changed his mind and argued that Darwin's "theory of natural selection is difficult to test" with respect to other areas of science.&lt;ref name="popper"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Popper |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Popper |date=December 1978 |title=Natural Selection and the Emergence of Mind |journal=Dialectica |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell Publishers]] |volume=32 |issue=3–4 |pages=339–355 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1978.tb01321.x |issn=1746-8361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first=John R. |date=Fall 1981 |title=Misquoted Scientists Respond |url=http://ncse.com/cej/2/4/misquoted-scientists-respond |journal=Creation/Evolution |location=Buffalo, NY |publisher=National Center for Science Education |volume=2 |issue=4 |accessdate=2015-03-29}} Quoting Popper: "I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make a recantation."&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1982 book, ''Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism'', philosopher of science [[Philip Kitcher]] specifically addresses the "falsifiability" question by taking into account notable philosophical critiques of Popper by [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and provides a definition of theory other than as a set of falsifiable statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hempel|1965|}}
* {{harvnb|Quine|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Kitcher points out, if one took a strictly Popperian view of "theory," observations of [[Uranus]] when it was first discovered in 1781 would have "falsified" [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[celestial mechanics]]. Rather, people suggested that another planet influenced Uranus' orbit—and this prediction was indeed eventually confirmed. Kitcher agrees with Popper that "there is surely something right in the idea that a science can succeed only if it can fail."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitcher|1982|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he insists that we view scientific theories as consisting of an "elaborate collection of statements," some of which are not falsifiable, and others—what he calls "auxiliary hypotheses," which are.

=== Tautological nature ===
A related claim to the supposed unfalsifiability of evolution is that natural selection is [[tautology (logic)|tautological]].&lt;ref name="popper" /&gt; Specifically, it is often argued that the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]" is a tautology, in that [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] is defined as ability to survive and reproduce.  This phrase was first used by [[Herbert Spencer]] in 1864 but is rarely used by biologists. Additionally, fitness is more accurately defined as the state of possessing traits that make survival more likely; this definition, unlike simple "survivability," avoids being trivially true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/tautology_org_ver.html |title=A Good Tautology is Hard to Find |last=Wilkins |first=John S. |year=1997 |work=Evolution and Philosophy |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-03-30}} Original version. Updated version [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/tautology.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Survival of the fittest]] for a more thorough discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, it is argued that evolutionary theory is [[circular reasoning]], in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required to interpret the evidence. An example of this is the claim that geological [[stratum|strata]] are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in.&lt;ref name=icr-morris /&gt; However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by [[radiometric dating]], and most strata were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dating.html |title=Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale: Circular Reasoning or Reliable Tools? |last=MacRae |first=Andrew |date=October 2, 1998 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
{{further|Evidence of common descent}}

Objections to the evidence that evolution occurs tend to be more concrete and specific, often involving direct analysis of evolutionary biology's methods and claims.

===Lack of observation===
[[File:Archaeopteryx-model.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Transitional fossil|Transitional species]] such as the ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' have been a fixture of the [[creation–evolution controversy|creation–evolution debate]] for almost 150 years.]]

A common claim of creationists is that evolution has never been observed.&lt;ref name="hovinddvd"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Kent Hovind]] (Presenter) |year=2002 |origyear=Original series published 1998 |title=The Dangers of Evolution |medium=DVD |location=Pensacola, FL |publisher=[[Kent Hovind#Creation Science Evangelism and Creation Today|Creation Science Evangelism]] |id=Creation Seminar Series, part 5 |oclc=57301209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the [[#Defining evolution|Defining evolution]] section above). Under the conventional biological definition of ''evolution'', it is a simple matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], [[Mouse|mice]], and [[bacteria]] in the laboratory,&lt;ref name="Buckling"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buckling |first1=Angus |last2=Maclean |first2=R.

Such studies on [[experimental evolution]], particularly those using [[microorganism]]s, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, especially in the case of [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]].&lt;ref name="Buckling" /&gt;&lt;ref name=naturepublishing-2003-elena /&gt;

In response to such examples, creationists say there are two major subdivisions of evolution to be considered, [[microevolution]] and [[macroevolution]], and it is questionable if macro-evolution has been physically observed to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tbsef.org/FAQ.htm#Is%20TBSEF%20against%20teaching%20evolution? |title=Questions frequently asked about the TBSEF: Is TBSEF against teaching evolution? |website=Texans for Better Science Education Foundation |location=Spring, TX |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/kansas/kangaroo10.html |title=Kansas Evolution Hearings: Part 10 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |type=Transcript |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most creationist organizations do not dispute the occurrence of short-term, relatively minor evolutionary changes, such as that observed even in [[dog breeding]]. Rather, they dispute the occurrence of major evolutionary changes over long periods of time, which by definition cannot be directly observed, only inferred from microevolutionary processes and the traces of macroevolutionary ones.

As biologists define ''macroevolution'', both microevolution and macroevolution have been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB901.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CB901: No Macroevolution |date=April 16, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-03-31 |quote=As biologists use the term, macroevolution means evolution at or above the species level.

Additionally, past macroevolution can be inferred from historical traces. Transitional fossils, for example, provide plausible links between several different groups of organisms, such as ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' linking [[bird]]s and non-avian [[dinosaur]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mayr |first1=Gerald |authorlink1=Gerald Mayr |last2=Pohl |first2=Burkhard |last3=Peters |first3=D. Stefan |date=December 2, 2005 |title=A well-preserved ''Archaeopteryx'' specimen with theropod features |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |volume=310 |issue=5753 |pages=1483–1486 |bibcode=2005Sci...310.1483M |doi=10.1126/science.1120331 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=16322455}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''[[Tiktaalik]]'' linking fish and limbed amphibians.&lt;ref name=nature-2006-4-6-shubin-daeschler-jenkins /&gt; Creationists dispute such examples, from asserting that such fossils are hoaxes or that they belong exclusively to one group or the other, to asserting that there should be far more evidence of obvious transitional species. Darwin himself found the paucity of transitional species to be one of the greatest weaknesses of his theory: &lt;blockquote&gt;Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain  and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Darwin appealed to the limited collections then available, the extreme lengths of time involved, and different rates of change with some living species differing very little from fossils of the [[Silurian]] period. In later editions he added "that the periods during which species have been undergoing modification, though very long as measured by years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which these same species remained without undergoing any change."&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=298 280–313]}}
*{{harvnb|Darwin|1866|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F385&amp;pageseq=391 359–360]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of clear transitional fossils has increased enormously since Darwin's day, and this problem has been largely resolved with the advent of the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which predicts a primarily stable fossil record broken up by occasional major speciations.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-1998-2-25-elsberry /&gt;&lt;ref name=ugent-logica-1986-burian /&gt;

As more and more compelling direct evidence for inter-species and species-to-species evolution has been gathered, creationists have redefined their understanding of what amounts to "[[Baraminology|created kinds]]," and have continued to insist that more dramatic demonstrations of evolution be experimentally produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wieland |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Wieland |date=April 1991 |title=Variation, information and the created kind |url=http://creation.com/variation-information-and-the-created-kind |journal=Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal |publisher=Creation Ministries International |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=42–47 |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; One version of this objection is "Were you there?," popularized by [[Young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]] [[Ken Ham]]. It argues that because no one except God could directly observe events in the distant past, scientific claims are just speculation or "story-telling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ham |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Ham |year=1989 |title=Were You There? |url=http://www.icr.org/article/670/88/ |journal=Acts &amp; Facts |location=El Cajon, CA |publisher=Institute for Creation Research |volume=18 |issue=10 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=talkorigins-2004-5-10-isaak /&gt; DNA sequences of the [[genome]]s of organisms allow an independent test of their predicted relationships, since species which diverged more recently will be more closely related genetically than species which are more distantly related; such [[phylogenetic tree]]s show a hierarchical organization within the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]], as predicted by common descent.&lt;ref name=aaas-1997-4-11-huelsenbeck-rannala /&gt;&lt;ref name=naturepublishing-2005-5-delsuc-brinkman-philippe /&gt;

In fields such as [[astrophysics]] or [[meteorology]], where direct observation or laboratory experiments are difficult or impossible, the scientific method instead relies on observation and logical inference. In such fields, the test of falsifiability is satisfied when a theory is used to predict the results of new observations. When such observations contradict a theory's predictions, it may be revised or discarded if an alternative better explains the observed facts. For example, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's theory of gravitation]] was replaced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] when the latter was observed to more precisely predict the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].&lt;ref name="Ein1916"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Einstein |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Einstein |year=1916 |title=Die Grundlage der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie |trans-title=The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |format=PDF |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |language=de |volume='''354''' [49] |issue=7 |pages=769–822 |doi=10.1002/andp.19163540702 |bibcode=1916AnP...354..769E |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829045130/http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2006-08-29 |issn=0003-3804 |accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unreliable evidence===
A related objection is that evolution is based on unreliable evidence, claiming that evolution is not even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the argument that evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for evolution is likely to be overturned as some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.

Arguments against evolution's reliability are thus often based on analyzing the [[history of evolutionary thought]] or the [[history of science]] in general. Creationists point out that in the past, major [[paradigm shift|scientific revolutions]] have overturned theories that were at the time considered near-certain. They thus claim that current evolutionary theory is likely to undergo such a revolution in the future, on the basis that it is a "theory in crisis" for one reason or another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA110.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CA110: Evolution will soon be widely rejected |year=2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Haeckel drawings.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[George Romanes]]' 1892 copy of Ernst Haeckel's [[embryo drawings]], often attributed incorrectly to Haeckel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richardson |first1=Michael K. |last2=Keuck |first2=Gerhard |date=November 2002 |title=Haeckel's ABC of evolution and development |journal=Biological Reviews |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] on behalf of the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]] |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=495–528 |doi=10.1017/S1464793102005948 |issn=1464-7931 |pmid=12475051}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Critics of evolution commonly appeal to past scientific [[hoax]]es such as the [[Piltdown Man]] [[archaeological forgery|forgery]]. It is argued that because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects of evolution, the current evidence for evolution is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for evolution has been accused of being fraudulent at various times, including ''Archaeopteryx'', [[peppered moth evolution|peppered moth melanism]], and [[Darwin's finches]]; these claims have been subsequently refuted.&lt;ref name=archaeopteryx-1986-charig-greenaway-milner-walker-whybrow /&gt;&lt;ref name=talkorigins-1997-12-15-nedin /&gt;&lt;ref name="wells"&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=talkorigins-faqs-wells /&gt;

It has also been claimed that certain former pieces of evidence for evolution which are now considered out-of-date and erroneous, such as [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s 19th-century comparative drawings of embryos, used to illustrate his [[recapitulation theory]] (''"[[ontogeny]] recapitulates [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]]"''), were not merely errors but frauds.&lt;ref name="CB701"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB701.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CB701: Haeckel's embryo pictures |date=June 5, 2005 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molecular biology|Molecular biologist]] [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]]  criticizes biology [[textbook]]s by alleging that they continue to reproduce such evidence after it has been debunked.&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt; In response, the [[National Center for Science Education]] notes that none of the textbooks reviewed by Wells makes the claimed error, as Haeckel's drawings are shown in a historical context with discussion about why they are wrong, and the accurate modern drawings and photos used in the textbooks are misrepresented by Wells.&lt;ref name="Icon4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/icon-4-haeckels-embryos |title=Icon 4 — Haeckel's Embryos |last=Gishlick |first=Alan D. |date=November 23, 2006 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Oakland, CA |accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unreliable chronology===

Creationists claim that evolution relies on certain types of evidence that do not give reliable information about the past. For example, it is argued that [[radiometric dating]] technique of evaluating a material's age based on the [[radioactive decay]] rates of certain [[isotope]]s generates inconsistent and thus unreliable results. [[Radiocarbon dating]] based on the [[carbon-14]] isotope has been particularly criticized. It is argued that radiometric decay relies on a number of unwarranted assumptions such as the principle of [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], consistent decay rates, or rocks acting as [[closed system]]s. Such arguments have been dismissed by scientists on the grounds that independent methods have confirmed the reliability of radiometric dating as a whole; additionally, different radiometric dating methods and techniques have independently confirmed each other's results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD010.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CD010: Radiometric Dating |year=2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of this objection is that fossil evidence is not reliable. This is based on a much wider range of claims. These include that there are too many "gaps" in the fossil record,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC200.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CC200: Transitional fossils |date=November 5, 2006 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC200_1.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CC200.1: Transitional fossil abundance |date=January 29, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fossil-dating is circular (see the [[#Evolution is unfalsifiable|Unfalsifiability]] section above), or that certain fossils, such as [[polystrate fossil]]s, are seemingly "out of place." Examination by geologists have found polystrate fossils to be consistent with ''in situ'' formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC340.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CC340: Out-of-place fossils |date=March 22, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that certain features of evolution support creationism's [[catastrophism]] (cf. [[Genesis flood narrative|Great Flood]]), rather than evolution's [[gradualism|gradualistic]] [[punctuated equilibrium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC363.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CC363: Requirements for fossilization |date=July 23, 2003 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some assert is an ''ad hoc'' theory to explain the fossil gaps.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-2004-3-17-isaak /&gt;

==Plausibility==
Some of the oldest and most common objections to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent complexity and order in the natural world. It is argued{{by whom|date=December 2016}} that evolution is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various aspects of life, and therefore that an intelligence, such as God of the [[Abrahamic religions]], must at the very least be appealed to for those specific features.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Improbability===
{{further|Teleological argument|Watchmaker analogy|Evolutionary argument against naturalism|Haldane's dilemma}}
A common objection to evolution is that it is simply too unlikely for life, in its complexity and apparent "design," to have arisen "by chance." It is argued that the odds of life having arisen without a deliberate intelligence guiding it are so astronomically low that it is unreasonable ''not'' to infer an intelligent designer from the natural world, and specifically from the [[biodiversity|diversity of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Batten |first=Don |date=March 1995 |title=Cheating with chance |url=http://creation.com/cheating-with-chance |journal=Creation Ex Nihilo |publisher=Creation Ministries International |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=14–15 |accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more extreme version of this argument is that evolution cannot create complex structures (see the [[#Creation of complex structures|Creation of complex structures]] section below). The idea that it is simply too implausible for life to have evolved is often wrongly encapsulated with a quotation that the "probability of life originating on Earth is no greater than the chance that a hurricane, sweeping through a scrapyard, would have the luck to assemble a [[Boeing 747]]"—a claim attributed to [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] [[Fred Hoyle]] and known as [[Junkyard tornado|Hoyle's fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 137–138]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoyle was a Darwinist, [[Atheism|atheist]] and [[Antitheism|anti-theist]], but advocated the theory of [[panspermia]], in which abiogenesis begins in [[outer space]] and primitive life on Earth is held to have arrived via natural dispersion.

Views superficially similar, but unrelated to Hoyle's, are thus invariably justified with arguments from analogy. The basic idea of this argument for a designer is the [[teleological argument]], an argument for the [[existence of God]] based on the perceived order or purposefulness of the [[universe]]. A common way of using this as an objection to evolution is by appealing to the 18th-century philosopher William Paley's watchmaker analogy, which argues that certain natural phenomena are analogical to a watch (in that they are ordered, or complex, or purposeful), which means that, like a watch, they must have been designed by a "watchmaker"—an intelligent agent. This argument forms the core of intelligent design, a neo-creationist movement seeking to establish certain variants of the design argument as legitimate science, rather than as philosophy or [[theology]], and have them be taught alongside evolution.&lt;ref name="SM07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scott" /&gt;
[[File:WilliamPaley.jpg|frame|left|Because the theory of evolution is often thought of as the idea that life arose "by chance," [[teleological argument|design arguments]] such as [[William Paley]]'s [[watchmaker analogy]] of 1802 have long been popular objections to the theory:&lt;ref name="chance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/chance/chance.html |title=Evolution and Chance |last=Wilkins |first=John S. |date=April 17, 1997 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-04-02}} Version 2.1 Draft 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Paley's book included a response to the proto-evolutionary ideas of [[Erasmus Darwin]].]]
This objection is fundamentally an [[argument from ignorance|argument by lack of imagination]], or argument from incredulity: a certain explanation is seen as being [[counterintuitive]], and therefore an alternate, more intuitive explanation is appealed to instead. Supporters of evolution generally respond by arguing that evolution is not based on "chance," but on predictable chemical interactions: natural processes, rather than supernatural beings, are the "designer." Although the process involves some random elements, it is the non-random selection of survival-enhancing genes that drives evolution along an ordered trajectory. The fact that the results are ordered and seem "designed" is no more evidence for a supernatural intelligence than the appearance of complex natural phenomena (e.g. [[Snow#Snowflakes|snowflakes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CI/CI100.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CI100: Intelligent Design |date=April 3, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that there is insufficient evidence to make statements about the plausibility or implausibility of abiogenesis, that certain structures demonstrate [[argument from poor design|poor design]], and that the implausibility of life evolving exactly as it did is no more evidence for an intelligence than the implausibility of a deck of cards being shuffled and dealt in a certain random order.&lt;ref name="scott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chance" /&gt;

It has also been noted that arguments against some form of life arising "by chance" are really objections to nontheistic abiogenesis, not to evolution. Indeed, arguments against "evolution" are based on the misconception that abiogenesis is a component of, or necessary precursor to, evolution. Similar objections sometimes conflate the Big Bang with evolution.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-1993-1-22-moran-definition /&gt;

[[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] and philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]], a supporter of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God would be expected to create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; This novel [[epistemology|epistemological]] argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, is more likely to be selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fitelson |first1=Branden |last2=Sober |first2=Elliott |authorlink2=Elliott Sober |date=June 1998 |title=Plantinga's Probability Arguments Against Evolutionary Naturalism |url=http://fitelson.org/plant.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Pacific Philosophical Quarterly]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell on behalf of the School of Philosophy ([[University of Southern California]]) |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=115–129 |doi=10.1111/1468-0114.00053 |issn=0279-0750 |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA120.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CA120: Mind's fallibility |date=September 1, 2003 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to complex structures and systems, among the phenomena that critics variously claim evolution cannot explain are [[consciousness]], [[Evolution of human intelligence|hominid intelligence]], [[instinct]]s, [[emotion]]s, [[metamorphosis]], [[photosynthesis]], [[homosexuality]], [[music]], [[language]], religion, morality, and [[altruism]] (see [[Altruism (biology)|altruism in animals]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |authorlink=Phillip E.

Supporters of evolution further contend that no alternative explanation has been able to adequately explain the biological origin of these phenomena either.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-2003-9-17-isaak /&gt;

Creationists argue against evolution on the grounds that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the [[meaning of life]]. In such instances, ''evolution'' is being [[#Defining evolution|redefined]] to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CE/CE440.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CE440: The origin of it all |date=September 25, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impossibility==
This class of objections is more radical than the above, claiming that a major aspect of evolution is not merely unscientific or implausible, but rather impossible, because it contradicts some other law of nature or is constrained in such a way that it cannot produce the biological diversity of the world.

Modern evolutionary theory posits that all biological systems must have evolved incrementally, through a combination of natural selection and [[genetic drift]]. Both Darwin and his early detractors recognized the potential problems that could arise for his theory of natural selection if the lineage of organs and other biological features could not be accounted for by gradual, step-by-step changes over successive generations; if all the intermediary stages between an initial organ and the organ it will become are not all improvements upon the original, it will be impossible for the later organ to develop by the process of natural selection alone. Complex organs such as the eye had been presented by William Paley as exemplifying the need for [[teleological argument|design by God]], and anticipating early criticisms that the [[evolution of the eye]] and other complex organs seemed impossible, Darwin noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[R]eason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, [[Ethology|ethologist]] and evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] said on the topic of the evolution of the [[feather]] in an interview for the television program ''[[The Atheism Tapes]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There's got to be a series of advantages all the way in the feather. If you can't think of one, then that's your problem not natural selection's problem... It's perfectly possible feathers began as fluffy extensions of reptilian scales to act as insulators... The earliest feathers might have been a different approach to hairiness among reptiles keeping warm.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On this basis, Behe argues that such structures were "purposely arranged by an intelligent agent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Behe |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael Behe |date=October 29, 1996 |title=Darwin Under the Microscope |url=http://www.arn.org/docs/behe/mb_dm11496.htm |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=25 |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irreducible complexity is the idea that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that they could not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the [[coagulation#The coagulation cascade|blood clotting cascade]], the [[immune system]], and the [[Flagellum#Bacterial|bacterial flagellum]] are so complex and interdependent that they could not have evolved from simpler systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Behe|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flip side of this claim is that the flagellum can't be produced by natural selection acting on random mutation, or any other unintelligent process. To falsify such a claim, a scientist could go into the laboratory, place a bacterial species lacking a flagellum under some selective pressure (for mobility, say), grow it for ten thousand generations, and see if a flagellum--or any equally complex system--was produced.

===Creation of information===
{{further|Physical information|Biosemiotics}}
A recent objection of creationists to evolution is that evolutionary mechanisms such as [[mutation]] cannot generate new [[physical information|information]]. Creationists such as [[William A. Dembski]], [[Werner Gitt]], and [[Lee Spetner]] have attempted to use [[information theory]] to dispute evolution. Dembski has argued that life demonstrates [[specified complexity]], and proposed a law of conservation of information that extremely improbable "complex specified information" could be conveyed by natural means but never originated without an [[intelligent designer|intelligent agent]].  Gitt asserted that information is an intrinsic characteristic of life and that an analysis demonstrates the mind and will of their Creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gitt |first=Werner |authorlink=Werner Gitt |date=August 1996 |title=Information, Science and Biology |url=http://creation.com/images/pdfs/tj/j10_2/j10_2_181-187.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal |publisher=Creation Ministries International |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=181–187 |accessdate=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These claims have been widely rejected by the scientific community which asserts that new information is regularly generated in evolution whenever a novel mutation or [[gene duplication]] arises. Dramatic examples of entirely new and unique traits arising through mutation have been observed in recent years, such as the evolution of [[nylon-eating bacteria]] which developed new [[enzyme]]s to efficiently digest a material that never existed before the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/information/infotheory.html |title=Information Theory and Creationism |last1=Musgrave |first1=Ian |last2=Baldwin |first2=Rich |year=2005 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-03-24|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm |title=Evolution and Information: The Nylon Bug |last=Thomas |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Thomas (skeptic) |publisher=[[New Mexicans for Science and Reason]] |location=Albuquerque, NM |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no need to account for the creation of information when an organism is considered together with the environment it evolved in. The information in the genome forms a record of how it was possible to survive in a particular environment. The information is gathered from the environment through [[trial and error]] as mutating organisms either reproduce or fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Bergstrom |first1=Carl T. |authorlink=Carl Bergstrom |last2=Lachmann |first2=Michael |title=The fitness value of information |year=2006 |eprint=q-bio.PE/0510007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violation of the second law of thermodynamics===
{{further|Entropy and life}}
[[File:Photosynthesis.gif|thumb|200px|right|Since [[Earth]] receives energy from the [[Sun]], it is an open system. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] applies only to isolated systems.]]

Another objection is that evolution violates the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1974|p=45}}: "Until evolutionists can not only speculate, but demonstrate, that there does exist in nature some vast program to direct the growth toward higher complexity of the marvelous organic space-time unity known as the terrestrial biosphere (not to mention that of the cosmos), as well as some remarkable global power converter to energize the growth through converted solar energy, the whole evolutionary idea is negated by the Second Law."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Patterson|1984|pp=99–116}}: "Henry Morris, director of the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) has joined several other engineers to make thermodynamics a cornerstone of the creation-evolution controversy. For twenty years Morris has maintained that the second law of thermodynamics directly contradicts evolution. ... Is there, indeed, a paradox at all? The answer to this question is, quite simply - no! Morris and his colleagues have constructed a completely fallacious and deceptive argument."&lt;/ref&gt; The law states that "the entropy of an isolated system not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium". In other words, an isolated system's [[entropy]] (a measure of the dispersal of energy in a physical system so that it is not available to do mechanical work) will tend to increase or stay the same, not decrease. Creationists argue that evolution violates this physical law by requiring a decrease in entropy, or disorder, over time.&lt;ref name=icr-morris /&gt;&lt;ref name=aig-thermodynamics-evolution /&gt;

The claims have been criticized for ignoring that the second law only applies to [[isolated system]]s. Organisms are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open systems]] as they constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It is argued that the Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of [[self-organization|self-organizing]] life.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-2003-10-1-faq-misconceptions-isaak /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.gmu.edu/~roerter/EvolutionEntropy.htm |title=Does Life On Earth Violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics? |last=Oerter |first=Robert N. |year=2006 |publisher=[[George Mason University]] |location=Fairfax, VA |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ncse-creationism-laws-thermodynamics /&gt;

Since the second law of thermodynamics has a precise mathematical definition, this argument can be analyzed quantitatively.&lt;ref name="Styer"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Styer |first=Daniel F. |authorlink=Daniel F. Styer |date=November 2008 |title=Entropy and evolution |journal=[[American Journal of Physics]] |location=College Park, MD |publisher=[[American Association of Physics Teachers]]; [[American Institute of Physics]] |volume=76 |issue=11 |pages=1031–1033 |doi=10.1119/1.2973046 |issn=0002-9505|bibcode=2008AmJPh..76.1031S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bunn |first=Emory F. |date=October 2009 |title=Evolution and the Second Law of Thermodynamics |arxiv=0903.4603|journal=American Journal of Physics |location=College Park, MD |publisher=American Association of Physics Teachers; American Institute of Physics |volume=77 |issue=10 |pages=922–925 |doi=10.1119/1.3119513 |issn=0002-9505|bibcode=2009AmJPh..77..922B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was done by [[physicist]] [[Daniel F.

In a published letter to the editor of ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'' titled "How anti-evolutionists abuse mathematics," [[mathematician]] [[Jason Rosenhouse]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact is that natural forces routinely lead to local decreases in entropy. Water freezes into ice and fertilised eggs turn into babies.

==Moral implications==
Other common objections to evolution allege that evolution leads to objectionable results, including bad beliefs, behaviors, and events. It is argued that the teaching of evolution degrades values, undermines morals, and fosters [[irreligion]] or [[atheism]]. These may be considered [[appeal to consequences|appeals to consequences]] (a form of [[Informal fallacy|logical fallacy]]), as the potential ramifications of belief in evolutionary theory have nothing to do with its objective empirical reality.

In 1917, [[Vernon Kellogg]] published ''Headquarters Nights: A Record of Conversations and Experiences at the Headquarters of the German Army in France and Belgium'', which asserted that German intellectuals were totally committed to might-makes-right due to "whole-hearted acceptance of the worst of Neo-Darwinism, the ''Allmacht'' of natural selection applied rigorously to human life and society and ''Kultur''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellogg|1917|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;num=30&amp;as_brr=0&amp;id=RhIjAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=intitle%3AHeadquarters+intitle%3ANights+inauthor%3AVernon+inauthor%3AKellogg&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;q=flussen#PPA22,M1 22–31]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strongly influenced the politician [[William Jennings Bryan]], who saw Darwinism as a moral threat to America and campaigned against evolutionary theory; his campaign culminated in the [[Scopes Trial]], which effectively prevented teaching of evolution in most public schools until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=pbs-evolution-library-scopes-trial /&gt;

[[Henry M.

[[Michael Shermer]] argued in ''Scientific American'' in October 2006 that evolution supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes and the rule of law.&lt;ref name=michaelshermer-2006-10-shermer /&gt; He goes on to suggest that evolution gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model, the more common image subscribed to by creationists. Careful analysis of the creationist charges that evolution has led to moral relativism and the Holocaust yields the conclusion that these charges appear to be highly suspect.&lt;ref name=tallahassee-2008-2-6-ruse /&gt;{{dead link|date=December 2016}} Such analyses conclude that the origins of the Holocaust are more likely to be found in historical Christian anti-Semitism than in evolution.&lt;ref name=talkorigins-2007-3-13-isaak /&gt;&lt;ref name=talkreason-2007-08-24-avalos /&gt;

Evolution has been used to justify [[Social Darwinism]], the exploitation of so-called "lesser breeds without the law" by "superior races," particularly in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=perry-chase-jacob-jacob /&gt; Typically strong European nations that had successfully expanded their empires could be said to have "survived" in the struggle for dominance.&lt;ref name=perry-chase-jacob-jacob /&gt; With this attitude, Europeans except for  [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian missionaries]] rarely adopted any customs and languages of local people under their empires.&lt;ref name=perry-chase-jacob-jacob /&gt;

===Atheism===
{{further|Atheism}}
Another charge leveled at evolutionary theory by creationists is that belief in evolution is either tantamount to atheism, or conducive to atheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strobel|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TV6pTalyyx8C&amp;pg=PT39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 32]}}: "In my quest to determine if contemporary science points toward or away from God, I knew I had to first examine the claims of evolution in order to conclude once and for all whether Darwinism creates a reasonable foundation for atheism. That's because if the materialism of Darwinian evolution is a fact, then the atheist conclusions I reached as a student might still be valid."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arn-johnson /&gt; It is commonly claimed that all proponents of evolutionary theory are "materialistic atheists." On the other hand, Davis A. Young argues that creation science ''itself'' is harmful to Christianity because its bad science will turn more away than it recruits. Young asks, "Can we seriously expect non-Christians to develop a respect for Christianity if we insist on teaching the brand of science that creationism brings with it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, evolution neither requires nor rules out the existence of a supernatural being. Philosopher [[Robert T. Pennock]] makes the comparison that evolution is no more atheistic than [[plumbing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pennock|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. Allen Orr]], professor of biology at [[University of Rochester]], notes that:

{{quote|
Of the five founding fathers of twentieth-century evolutionary biology—[[Ronald Fisher]], [[Sewall Wright]], [[J. B. S. Haldane]], [[Ernst Mayr]], and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]]—one was a devout Anglican who preached sermons and published articles in church magazines, one a practicing Unitarian, one a dabbler in Eastern mysticism, one an apparent atheist, and one a member of the Russian Orthodox Church and the author of a book on religion and science.&lt;ref name=thenewyorker-orr /&gt; }}

In addition, a wide range of religions have reconciled a belief in a supernatural being with evolution.&lt;ref name=ncse-religiousorganizations /&gt; Molleen Matsumura of the National Center for Science Education found that "of Americans in the twelve largest Christian denominations, 89.6% belong to churches that support evolution education." These churches include the "[[United Methodist Church]], [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention USA]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] (USA), [[National Baptist Convention of America, Inc.|National Baptist Convention of America]], [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], and others."&lt;ref name=thewitchitaeagle-schrock /&gt; A poll in 2000 done for [[People for the American Way]] found that 70% of the American public felt that evolution was compatible with a belief in God. Only 48% of the people polled could choose the correct definition of evolution from a list, however.&lt;ref name=pfaw-public-education /&gt;

One poll reported in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' showed that among American scientists (across various disciplines), about 40 percent believe in both evolution and an active deity (theistic evolution).&lt;ref name=naturepublishing-larson /&gt; This is similar to the results reported for surveys of the general American public. Also, about 40 percent of the scientists polled believe in a God that answers [[prayer]]s, and believe in [[immortality]].&lt;ref name=ncse-witham /&gt; While about 55% of scientists surveyed were atheists, [[Agnosticism|agnostic]]s, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among scientists who support evolution, or among the general public that supports evolution. Very similar results were reported from a 1997 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup Poll]] of the American public and scientists.&lt;ref name=religioustolerance-robinson /&gt;

Traditionalists still object to the idea that diversity in life, including human beings, arose through natural processes without a need for supernatural intervention, and they argue against evolution on the basis that it contradicts their literal interpretation of [[creation myth]]s about separate "[[Baraminology|created kinds]]." However, many religions, such as [[Catholicism]], have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through theistic evolution.&lt;ref name=caltech-1996-10-30-pope-john-paul-ii /&gt;&lt;ref name=ekklesia /&gt;

In the popular mind, the concepts of evolution justified the exploitation by the 'superior races' of 'lesser breeds without the law.' This language of race and conflict, of superior and inferior people, had wide currency in the Western nations. Social Darwinists vigorously advocated empires, saying that strong nations—by definition, those that were successful at expanding industry and empire—would survive and others would not. To these elitists, all white peoples were more fit than nonwhites to prevail in the struggle for dominance. Even among Europeans, some nations were deemed more fit than others for the competition. Usually, Social Darwinists thought their own nation the best, an attitude that sparked their competitive enthusiasm. ...In the nineteenth century, in contrast to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Europeans, except for missionaries, rarely adopted the customs or learned the languages of local people. They had little sense that other cultures and other peoples deserved respect. Many Westerners believed that it was their Christian duty to set an example and to educate others. Missionaries were the first to meet and learn about many peoples and the first to develop writing for those without a written language. Christian missionaries were ardently opposed to slavery...."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Obsessive–compulsive disorder''' ('''OCD''') is a [[mental disorder]] where people feel the need to check things repeatedly, perform [[compulsive behavior|certain routines repeatedly]] (called "rituals"), or have [[intrusive thoughts|certain thoughts repeatedly]] (called "obsessions").&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Common activities include [[hand washing]], counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Some may have difficulty throwing things out.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; These activities occur to such a degree that the person's daily life is negatively affected.&lt;ref name=NIH2015&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml|website=U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)|author=The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)|date=January 2016|accessdate=24 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723194024/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml|archivedate=23 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often takes up more than an hour a day.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|pages=237–242|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; The condition is associated with [[tic disorders|tics]], [[anxiety disorder]], and an increased risk of [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ang2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angelakis|first1=I|last2=Gooding|first2=P|last3=Tarrier|first3=N|last4=Panagioti|first4=M|title=Suicidality in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): A systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|publisher=[[Pergamon Press]]|location=Oxford, England|date=25 March 2015|volume=39|pages=1–15|pmid=25875222|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause is unknown.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; There appear to be some [[genetics|genetic]] components with both [[identical twins]] more often affected than both non-identical twins.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Risk factors include a history of [[child abuse]] or other [[stress (psychological)|stress]]-inducing event.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Some cases have been documented to occur following [[infection]]s.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and requires ruling out other drug related or medical causes.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Rating scales such as the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS) can be used to assess the severity.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenske JN, Schwenk TL | title = Obsessive compulsive disorder: diagnosis and management | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–45 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19621834 | doi =  | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0801/p239.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140512222223/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0801/p239.html | archivedate = 12 May 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other disorders with similar symptoms include anxiety disorder, [[major depressive disorder]], [[eating disorders]], [[tic disorders]], and [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and prognosis --&gt;
Treatment involves [[psychotherapy|counseling]], such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), and sometimes [[antidepressants]] such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) or [[clomipramine]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ve2014 /&gt; CBT for OCD involves increasing exposure to what causes the problems while not allowing the repetitive behavior to occur.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014&gt;{{cite journal | author = Grant JE | title = Clinical practice: Obsessive-compulsive disorder. | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 371 | issue = 7 | pages = 646–53 | date = 14 August 2014 | pmid = 25119610 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcp1402176}}&lt;/ref&gt; While clomipramine appears to work as well as SSRIs, it has greater side effects so is typically reserved as a second line treatment.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt; [[Atypical antipsychotic]]s may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment-resistant cases but are also associated with an increased risk of side effects.&lt;ref name=Ve2014&gt;{{cite journal |last=Veale |first= D|last2= Miles|first2=S |last3=Smallcombe |first3= N|last4=Ghezai |first4=H |last5=Goldacre |first5=B|last6=Hodsoll |first6=J |date=29 November 2014 |title=Atypical antipsychotic augmentation in SSRI treatment refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis. |journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume= 14|issue= |pages=317 |doi=10.1186/s12888-014-0317-5 |pmid=25432131 |pmc=4262998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dec2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Decloedt EH, Stein DJ | title = Current trends in drug treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | volume = 6 | issue = |pages = 233–42 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20520787 | pmc = 2877605 | doi = 10.2147/NDT.S3149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without treatment, the condition often lasts decades.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, Society and Culture --&gt;
Obsessive–compulsive disorder affects about 2.3% of people at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Good2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodman|first1=WK|last2=Grice|first2=DE|last3=Lapidus|first3=KA|last4=Coffey|first4=BJ|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=The Psychiatric Clinics of North America|date=September 2014|volume=37|issue=3|pages=257–67|pmid=25150561|doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates during a given year are about 1.2%, and it occurs worldwide.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; It is unusual for symptoms to begin after the age of 35, and half of people develop problems before 20.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Males and females are affected about equally.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; In English, the phrase ''obsessive–compulsive'' is often used in an informal manner unrelated to OCD to describe someone who is excessively meticulous, [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionistic]], absorbed, or otherwise fixated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bynum|first1=W.F.|last2=Porter|first2=Roy|last3=Shepherd|first3=Michael|title=The anatomy of madness : essays in the history of psychiatry|date=1985|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-32382-6|pages=166–187|chapter=Obsessional Disorders: A Conceptual History.

== Signs and symptoms ==
OCD can present with a wide variety of symptoms. Certain groups of symptoms usually occur together. These groups are sometimes viewed as dimensions or clusters that may reflect an underlying process. The standard assessment tool for OCD, the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS), has 13 predefined categories of symptoms. These symptoms fit into three to five groupings.&lt;ref name="Leckman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leckman|first1=JF|last2=Bloch|first2=MH|last3=King|first3=RA|title=Symptom dimensions and subtypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a developmental perspective.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=21–33|pmid=19432385|pmc=3181902}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta analysis|meta analytic]] review of symptom structures found a four factor structure (grouping) to be most reliable.  The observed groups included a "symmetry factor", a "forbidden thoughts factor", a "cleaning factor", and a "hoarding factor".  The "symmetry factor" correlated highly with obsessions related to ordering, counting, and symmetry, as well as repeating compulsions.  The "forbidden thoughts factor" correlated highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent, religious, or sexual nature. The "cleaning factor" correlated highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning. The "hoarding factor" only involved hoarding related obsessions and compulsions, and was identified as being distinct from other symptom groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloch|first1=MH|last2=Landeros-Weisenberger|first2=A|last3=Rosario|first3=MC|last4=Pittenger|first4=C|last5=Leckman|first5=JF|title=Meta-analysis of the symptom structure of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=December 2008|volume=165|issue=12|pages=1532–42|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08020320|pmid=18923068|pmc=3972003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While OCD has been considered a homogenous disorder from a neuropsychological perspective, many of the putative neuropsychological deficits may be due to comorbid disorders.  Furthermore, some subtypes have been associated with improvement in performance on certain tasks such as pattern recognition (washing subtype) and spatial working memory (obsessive thought subtype). Subgroups have also been distinguished by neuroimaging findings and treatment response.  Neuroimaging studies on this have been too few, and the subtypes examined have differed too much to draw any conclusions.  On the other hand, subtype dependent treatment response has been studied, and the hoarding subtype has consistently responded least to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=D|last2=Abramowitz|first2=JS|last3=Calamari|first3=JE|last4=Kyrios|first4=M|last5=Radomsky|first5=A|last6=Sookman|first6=D|last7=Taylor|first7=S|last8=Wilhelm|first8=S|title=A critical evaluation of obsessive-compulsive disorder subtypes: symptoms versus mechanisms.|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|date=July 2004|volume=24|issue=3|pages=283–313|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2004.04.003|pmid=15245833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obsessions are thoughts that recur and persist, despite efforts to ignore or confront them.&lt;ref name=Review10&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Y|last1=Markarian|first2=MJ|last2=Larson|first3=MA|last3=Aldea|first4=SA|last4=Baldwin|first5=D|last5=Good|first6=A|last6=Berkeljon|first7=TK|last7=Murphy|first8=EA|last8=Storch|first9=D|last9=McKay| title = Multiple pathways to functional impairment in obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = [[Clinical Psychology Review]] |volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 78–88 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19853982 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with OCD frequently perform tasks, or [[Compulsive behavior|compulsions]], to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. Within and among individuals, the initial obsessions, or intrusive thoughts, vary in their clarity and vividness. A relatively vague obsession could involve a general sense of disarray or tension accompanied by a belief that life cannot proceed as normal while the imbalance remains. A more intense obsession could be a preoccupation with the thought or image of someone close to them dying{{sfn|Baer|2001|pp=33, 78}}{{sfn|Baer|2001|p=xiv}} or intrusions related to "[[Relationship obsessive–compulsive disorder|relationship rightness]]".&lt;ref name = Doron2013&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G|last1=Doron|first2=O|last2=Szepsenwol|first3=E|last3=Karp|first4=N|last4=Gal| title = Obsessing About Intimate-Relationships: Testing the Double Relationship-Vulnerability Hypothesis | journal = [[Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry]] |volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 433–440 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23792752 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbtep.2013.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other obsessions concern the possibility that someone or something other than oneself—such as God, the Devil, or disease—will harm either the person with OCD or the people or things that the person cares about. Other individuals with OCD may experience the sensation of invisible protrusions emanating from their bodies, or have the feeling that inanimate objects are ensouled.&lt;ref name=Mash&gt;{{cite book|first1=Eric J.|last1=Mash|first2=David A.|last2=Wolfe|title=Abnormal child psychology|edition=3|date=2005|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation|Thomson Wadsworth]]|location=[[Belmont, California]]|page=197|isbn= 978-1305105423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people with OCD experience [[sexual obsessions]] that may involve intrusive thoughts or images of "kissing, touching, fondling, [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]], intercourse, [[incest]], and [[rape]]" with "strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals, and religious figures", and can include "[[heterosexual]] or [[homosexual]] content" with persons of any age.&lt;ref name="Osgood"&gt;{{cite web|first=Deborah|last=Osgood-Hynes|url=http://www.raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf|title=Thinking Bad Thoughts|publisher=MGH/McLean OCD Institute|location=Belmont, Massachusetts|accessdate=December 30, 2006|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115230001/http://raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf |archive-date=November 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, some disquieting sexual thoughts at times are normal, but people with OCD may attach extraordinary significance to the thoughts. For example, obsessive fears about [[sexual orientation]] can appear to the person with OCD, and even to those around them, as a crisis of [[sexual identity]].&lt;ref name="ItMoved"&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven|last=Phillipson|url=http://www.ocdonline.com/articlephillipson7.php|title=I Think It Moved|website=OCDOnline.com|publisher=Center for Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy|location=New York City|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218215734/http://www.ocdonline.com/articlephillipson7.php |archive-date=December 18, 2008|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sexfears"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark-Ameen|last=Johnson|url=http://www.brainphysics.com/yourenotgay.php|title=I'm Gay and You're Not : Understanding Homosexuality Fears|website=brainphysics.com|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505042912/http://www.brainphysics.com/yourenotgay.php |archive-date=5 May 2009|accessdate=14 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the troubling thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or self-loathing.&lt;ref name="Osgood" /&gt;

Most people with OCD understand that their notions do not correspond with reality; however, they feel that they must act as though their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in [[compulsive hoarding]] might be inclined to treat inorganic matter as if it had the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level. There is a debate as to whether or not hoarding should be considered with other OCD symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=DL|last2=Timpano|first2=KR|last3=Wheaton|first3=MG|last4=Greenberg|first4=BD|last5=Miguel|first5=EC|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder and its related disorders: a reappraisal of obsessive-compulsive spectrum concepts.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=12|issue=2|pages=131–48|pmid=20623919|pmc=3181955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCD sometimes manifests without overt compulsions, referred to as Primarily Obsessional OCD. OCD without overt compulsions could, by one estimate, characterize as many as 50 percent to 60 percent of OCD cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Myrna M.|last1=Weisman|title = The cross national epidemiology of obsessive–compulsive disorder | journal = New Developments in Obsessive-Compulsive and Spectrum Disorders|  volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 6–9 |date = May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compulsions ===
{{Main|Compulsive behavior}}

[[File:Derma me.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Dermatillomania|Skin-picking disorder]]]]

Some people with OCD perform compulsive rituals because they inexplicably feel they have to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so [[idiosyncratic]] or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive [[excoriation disorder|skin picking]], [[trichotillomania|hair-pulling]], [[nail biting]], and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Some individuals with OCD are aware that their behaviors are not rational, but feel compelled to follow through with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5|url=http://www.dsm5.org/documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|page=7|year=2013|accessdate=12 Apr 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204551/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common compulsions include hand washing, cleaning, checking things (e.g., locks on doors), repeating actions (e.g., turning on and off switches), ordering items in a certain way, and requesting reassurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Boyd MA |title=Psychiatric Nursing |journal=Issues in Mental Health Nursing |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=13–26 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3UUuXw7ISM0C&amp;pg=PA418|isbn=978-0-397-55178-1|pmid=8119793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsions are different from [[tics]] (such as touching, tapping, rubbing, or blinking)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Storch|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder in youth with and without a chronic tic disorder|url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/17345600|journal=Depression and Anxiety|year=2008|volume=25|issue=9|pages=761–767|doi=10.1002/da.20304|pmid=17345600|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[stereotypic movement disorder|stereotyped movements]] (such as head banging, body rocking, or self-biting), which usually aren't as complex and aren't precipitated by obsessions.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between compulsions and complex tics.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; About 10% to 40% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Conelea|year=2014|title=Tic-related obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): phenomenology and treatment outcome in the Pediatric OCD Treatment Study II|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=53|issue=12|pages=1308–16|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2014.09.014|pmid=25457929|display-authors=etal|pmc=4254546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People rely on compulsions as an escape from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the intrusive thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/obsessive-compulsive-disorder.|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, (2005) |accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfil their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with [[antibacterial soap]] and hot water can make their skin red and raw with [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |title=Hygiene of the Skin: When Is Clean Too Clean? Subtopic: "Skin Barrier Properties and Effect of Hand Hygiene Practices", Paragraph 5. |accessdate=26 March 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421205614/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |archivedate=21 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with OCD can use rationalizations to explain their behavior; however, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is ''still'' not sure and deems it is ''still'' better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.

=== Insight ===
The DSM-V contains three specifiers for the level of insight in OCD.  Good or fair insight is characterized by the acknowledgment that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are or may not be true.  Poor insight is characterized by the belief that obsessive-complsive beliefs are probably true.  Absence of insight make obsessive-compulsive beliefs [[delusion]]al thoughts, and occurs in about 4% of people with OCD.&lt;ref name="Sadock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=P|last2=Sadock|first2=B|last3=Sadock|first3=V|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|publisher=LWW|location=95218|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|edition=10th|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overvalued ideas ===
Some people with OCD exhibit what is known as ''overvalued ideas''. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do [[Exposure and response prevention|ERP therapy]] on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially.

== Causes ==
{{Main|Cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder}}
The cause is unknown.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Both environmental and genetic factors are believed to play a role. Risk factors include a history of [[child abuse]] or other [[stress (psychological)|stress]]-inducing event.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

=== Genetics ===
There appear to be some [[genetics|genetic]] components with [[identical twins]] more often affected than non-identical twins.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Further, individuals with OCD are more likely to have first-degree family members exhibiting the same disorders than do matched controls. In cases where OCD develops during childhood, there is a much stronger familial link in the disorder than cases in which OCD develops later in adulthood. In general, genetic factors account for 45–65% of the variability in OCD symptoms in children diagnosed with the disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid19665647"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abramowitz JS, Taylor S, McKay D | title = Obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Lancet | volume = 374 | issue = 9688 | pages = 491–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19665647 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60240-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study found evidence supporting the possibility of a heritable risk for OCD.&lt;ref name="Menzies et al, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Menzies L, Achard S, Chamberlain SR, Fineberg N, Chen CH, del Campo N, Sahakian BJ, Robbins TW, Bullmore E | title = Neurocognitive endophenotypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Brain | volume = 130 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 3223–36 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17855376 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awm205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been postulated by [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] that moderate versions of compulsive behavior may have had evolutionary advantages. Examples would be moderate constant checking of hygiene, the hearth or the environment for enemies. Similarly, [[hoarding]] may have had evolutionary advantages.

=== Cognitive models ===

Generally two categories of models for OCD have been postulated, the first involving deficits in executive function, and the second involving deficits in modulatory control.  The first category of executive dysfunction is based on the observed structural and functional abnormalities in the dlPFC, striatum, and thalamus.  The second category involving dysfunctional modulatory control primarily relies on observed functional and structural differences in the ACC, mPFC and OFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedlander|first1=L|last2=Desrocher|first2=M|title=Neuroimaging studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults and children.|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=January 2006|volume=26|issue=1|pages=32–49|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2005.06.010|pmid=16242823}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=ER|last2=Taylor|first2=SF|title=Cognitive neuroscience of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=The Psychiatric Clinics of North America|date=September 2014|volume=37|issue=3|pages=337–52|doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.05.004|pmid=25150566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One proposed model suggests that dysfunction in the [[orbitofrontal cortex|OFC]] leads to improper valuation of behaviors and decreased behavioral control, while the observed alterations in amygdala activations leads to exaggerated fears and representations of negative stimuli.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=J|last2=Ahmari|first2=SE|title=A Framework for Understanding the Emerging Role of Corticolimbic-Ventral Striatal Networks in OCD-Associated Repetitive Behaviors.|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=2015|volume=9|pages=171|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00171|pmid=26733823|pmc=4681810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the heterogeneity of OCD symptoms, studies differentiating between symptoms have been performed. Symptom specific neuroimaging abnormalities include the hyperactivity of caudate and ACC in checking rituals, while finding increased activity of cortical and cerebellar regions in contamination related symptoms. Neuroimaging differentiating between content of intrusive thoughts have found differences between aggressive as opposed to taboo thoughts, finding increased connectivity of the amygdala, ventral striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in aggressive symptoms, while observing increased connectivity between the ventral striatum and insula in sexual/religious intrusive thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakao|first1=Tomohiro|last2=Okada|first2=Kayo|last3=Kanba|first3=Shigenobu|title=Neurobiological model of obsessive-compulsive disorder: Evidence from recent neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|date=August 2014|volume=68|issue=8|pages=587–605|doi=10.1111/pcn.12195|pmid=24762196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model proposes that affective dysregulation links excessive reliance on habit based action selection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barahona-Corrêa|first1=JB|last2=Camacho|first2=M|last3=Castro-Rodrigues|first3=P|last4=Costa|first4=R|last5=Oliveira-Maia|first5=AJ|title=From Thought to Action: How the Interplay Between Neuroscience and Phenomenology Changed Our Understanding of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2015|volume=6|pages=1798|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01798|pmid=26635696|pmc=4655583}}&lt;/ref&gt; with compulsions.  This is supported by the observation that those with OCD demonstrate decreased activation of the [[ventral striatum]] when anticipating monetary  reward, as well as increase functional connectivity between the VS and the OFC.  Furthermore, those with OCD demonstrate reduced performance in pavlovian fear extinction tasks, hyper responsiveness in the amygdala to fearful stimuli, and hypo-resonsiveness in the amygdala when exposed to positively valanced stimuli.  Stimulation of the [[nucleus accumbens]] has also been observed to effectively alleviate both obsessions and compulsions, supporting the role of affective dysregulation in generating both.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

=== Neurobiological ===

From the observation of the efficacy of antidepressants in OCD, a serotonin hypothesis of OCD has been formulated. Studies of peripheral markers of serotonin, as well as challenges with proserotonergic compounds have yielded inconsistent results, including evidence pointing towards basal hyperactivity of serotonergic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Kenneth L|title=Neuropsychopharmacology : the fifth generation of progress : an official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology|date=2002|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0-7817-2837-9|pages=1609–1610|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serotonin receptor and transporter binding studies have yielded conflicting results, including higher and lower serotonin receptor [[5-HT2A]] and [[serotonin transporter]] binding potentials that were normalized by treatment with SSRIs. Despite inconsistencies in the types of abnormalities found, evidence points towards dysfunction of serotonergic systems in OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Muller |first1=Christian P |last2=Jacobs |first2=Barry L |author3=A Dijk|author4=A Klompmakers|author5=D Denys|title=Handbook of the behavioral neurobiology of serotonin|date=2009|publisher=Academic|location=London|isbn=978-0-12-374634-4|pages=547–558|edition=1st|chapter=4.4 The Serotonergic System in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orbitofrontal cortex]] overactivity is attenuated in people who have successfully responded to [[SSRI]] medication, a result believed to be caused by increased stimulation of [[serotonin]] receptors [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT2A]] and [[serotonin receptor|5-HT2C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim KW, Lee DY | title = Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Associated With a Left Orbitofrontal Infarct | journal = Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 88–89 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11884667 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.14.1.88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex relationship between dopamine and OCD has been observed. Although antipsychotics, which act by antagonizing dopamine receptors may improve some cases of OCD, they frequently exacerbate others.  Antipsychotics, in the low doses used to treat OCD, may actually increased the release of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, through inhibiting autoreceptors. Further complicating things is the efficacy of amphetamines, decreased [[dopamine transporter]] activity observed in OCD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=Jesse|last2=Ahmari|first2=Susanne E.|title=A Framework for Understanding the Emerging Role of Corticolimbic-Ventral Striatal Networks in OCD-Associated Repetitive Behaviors|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=17 December 2015|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00171|pmc=4681810|issn=1662-5137|pmid=26733823}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low levels of D2 binding in the striatum.&lt;ref name="glutamate" /&gt;  Furthermore, increased dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens after deep brain stimulation correlates with improvement in symptoms, pointing to reduced dopamine release in the striatum playing a role in generating symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graat|first1=I|last2=Figee|first2=M|last3=Denys|first3=D|editor1-last=Pittinger|editor1-first=C|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Phenomenology, Pathophysiology and Treatment|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter=Neurotransmitter Dysregulation in OCD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abnormalities in glutaminergic neurotransmission have implicated in OCD. Findings such as increased cerebrospinal glutamate, less consistent abnormalities observed in neuroimaging studies, and the efficacy of some glutaminergic drugs such as [[riluzole]] have implicated glutamate in OCD.&lt;ref name="glutamate"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pittenger|first1=Christopher|last2=Bloch|first2=Michael H.|last3=Williams|first3=Kyle|title=GLUTAMATE ABNORMALITIES IN OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER: NEUROBIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AND TREATMENT|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|date=3 March 2017|volume=132|issue=3|pages=314–332|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.09.006|pmc=3205262|issn=0163-7258|pmid=21963369}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OCD has been associated with reduced [[N-Acetylaspartic acid]] in the mPFC, which is thought to reflect neuron density or functionality, although the exact interpretation has not been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aoki|first1=Y|last2=Aoki|first2=A|last3=Suwa|first3=H|title=Reduction of N-acetylaspartate in the medial prefrontal cortex correlated with symptom severity in obsessive-compulsive disorder: meta-analyses of (1)H-MRS studies.|journal=Translational Psychiatry|date=14 August 2012|volume=2|issue=8|pages=e153|doi=10.1038/tp.2012.78|pmid=22892718|pmc=3432192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Formal diagnosis may be performed by a psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or other licensed mental health professional. To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] range of worries about conventional problems.&lt;ref name="Quick"&gt;''Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR''. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A person may attempt to ignore or [[Thought suppression|suppress]] such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational.

Compulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD ''must'' perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive.

Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational or scholastic functioning.&lt;ref name="Quick" /&gt; It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the peron's estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, concrete tools can be used to gauge the people’s condition. This may be done with rating scales, such as the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009" /&gt;

OCD is sometimes placed in a group of disorders called the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Starcevic|first1=V|last2=Janca|first2=A|title=Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders: still in search of the concept-affirming boundaries.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=January 2011|volume=24|issue=1|pages=55–60|pmid=20827198|doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e32833f3b58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis ===
OCD is often confused with the separate condition [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD). OCD is [[egodystonic]], meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's [[self-concept]].&lt;ref name="Aardema, F. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Aardema&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aardema F., O'Connor |year = 2003 | title = Seeing white bears that are not there: Inference processes in obsessions | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 23–37 | doi=10.1891/jcop.17.1.23.58270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because ego dystonic disorders go against a person's self-concept, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is [[egosyntonic]]—marked by the person's acceptance that the characteristics and behaviours displayed as a result are compatible with their [[self-image]], or are otherwise appropriate, correct or reasonable.

As a result, people with OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational, are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them.&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;Carter, K. "Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder." PSYC 210 lecture: Oxford College of Emory University. Oxford, GA. 11 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast people with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise, and they tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

== Management ==
A form of psychotherapy called "[[cognitive behavioral therapy]]" (CBT) and [[psychotropic medication]]s are first-line treatments for OCD.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NICE2005 /&gt; Other forms of psychotherapy, such as [[psychodynamic]] and [[psychoanalysis]] may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but in 2007 the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) noted a lack of [[Scientific control|controlled studies]] showing their effectiveness "in dealing with the core symptoms of OCD".&lt;ref name="APAguidelines"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koran LM, Hanna GL, Hollander E, Nestadt G, Simpson HB | title = Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 5–53 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17849776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with OCD.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Therapy ===

[[File:Pennsylvania Capitol front door keyhole.jpg|thumb|One exposure and ritual prevention activity would be to check the lock only once, and then leave]]

The specific technique used in CBT is called [[exposure and response prevention]] (ERP) which involves teaching the person to deliberately come into contact with the situations that trigger the obsessive thoughts and fears ("exposure"), without carrying out the usual compulsive acts associated with the obsession ("response prevention"), thus gradually learning to tolerate the discomfort and anxiety associated with not performing the ritualistic behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly "contaminated" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a "contaminated" location, such as a school.) That is the "exposure". The "ritual prevention" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly [[habituation|habituates]] to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level drops considerably; they can then progress to touching something more "contaminated" or not checking the lock at all—again, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"&gt;Huppert &amp; Roth: (2003) Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Exposure and Response Prevention. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 4 (1),'' 66 – 70 [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323025324/http://baojournal.com/ |date=23 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERP has a strong evidence base, and it is considered the most effective treatment for OCD.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com" /&gt; However, this claim was doubted by some researchers in 2000 who criticized the quality of many studies.&lt;ref name="pmid10910778"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Klein DF | title = Flawed meta-analyses comparing psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 157 | issue = 8 | pages = 1204–11 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10910778 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.8.1204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has generally been accepted that psychotherapy, in combination with psychiatric medication, is more effective than either option alone.

=== Medication ===

[[File:Anafranil Japan.jpg|thumb|A blister pack of [[clomipramine]] under the brand name ''Anafranil'']]

The medications most frequently used are the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs).&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt; [[Clomipramine]], a medication belonging to the class of [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, appears to work as well as SSRIs but has a higher rate of side effects.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt;

SSRIs are a second line treatment of adult obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) with mild functional impairment and as first line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment. In children, SSRIs can be considered as a second line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects.&lt;ref name=NICE2005&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg31/resources/treating-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-ocd-and-body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd-in-adults-children-and-young-people-194882077|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder: Core interventions in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder|author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)|series=Information about NICE Clinical Guideline 31|publisher=UK National Health Service (NHS)|date=November 2005|accessdate=24 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112001813/https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg31/resources/treating-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-ocd-and-body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd-in-adults-children-and-young-people-194882077|archivedate=12 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSRIs are efficacious in the treatment of OCD; people treated with SSRIs are about twice as likely to respond to treatment as those treated with placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Arroll B, Elley CR, Fishman T, Goodyear-Smith FA, Kenealy T, Blashki G, Kerse N, Macgillivray S | title = Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = |issue = 3 | pages = CD007954 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19588448 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007954 | url = https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/publications/85b92403-d474-4e5a-b606-65f7e0f86575|editor1-last = Arroll | editor1-first = Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825+ |title=Review Finds SSRIs Modestly Effective in Short-Term Treatment of OCD|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413110435/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825 |archivedate=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term (6–24&amp;nbsp;weeks) treatment trials and in discontinuation trials with durations of 28–52&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fineberg NA, Brown A, Reghunandanan S, Pampaloni I | title = Evidence-based pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 1173–91 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22226028 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145711001829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019839s070,020990s032lbl.pdf |title=Sertraline prescribing information |accessdate=30 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616011817/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019839s070%2C020990s032lbl.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apotex.com/us/en/products/downloads/pil/paxil_irtb_ins.pdf |title=Paroxetine prescribing information |accessdate=30 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219055046/https://www.apotex.com/us/en/products/downloads/pil/paxil_irtb_ins.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the National Institute of Clinical and Health Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommended [[antipsychotic]]s for OCD that does not improve with SSRI treatment.&lt;ref name="Ve2014" /&gt; For OCD there is tentative evidence for [[risperidone]] and insufficient evidence for [[olanzapine]].

A guideline by the APA suggested that [[dextroamphetamine]] may be considered by itself after more well supported treatments have been tried.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koran|first1=Lorrin|last2=Hanna|first2=Gregory|last3=Hollander|first3=Eric|last4=Nestadt|first4=Gerald|last5=Helen|first5=Simpson|title=Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|url=http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/ocd.pdf|website=American Psychiatric Association|publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Procedures ===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) has been found to have effectiveness in some severe and refractory cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cybulska Eva M | year = 2006 | title = Obsessive Compulsive disorder, the brain and electroconvulsive therapy | url = | journal = British Journal of Hospital Medicine | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 77–82 | doi=10.12968/hmed.2006.67.2.20466| pmid = 16498907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[psychosurgery|Surgery]] may be used as a last resort in people who do not improve with other treatments. In this procedure, a surgical [[lesion]] is made in an area of the brain (the [[cingulate cortex]]). In one study, 30% of participants benefitted significantly from this procedure.&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;Barlow, D. H. and V. M. Durand. ''Essentials of Abnormal Psychology''. California: Thomson Wadsworth, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deep-brain stimulation]] and [[vagus nerve stimulation]] are possible surgical options that do not require destruction of [[brain tissue]]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration approved deep-brain stimulation for the treatment of OCD under a humanitarian device exemption requiring that the procedure be performed only in a hospital with specialist qualifications to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barlas S |title=FDA Approves Pioneering Treatment for Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=26 |issue=4 |date=8 April 2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ocd/article/10168/1399208 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710101738/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ocd/article/10168/1399208 |archivedate=10 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the person has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive [[cognitive–behavioral therapy]] with exposure and ritual/response prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainphysics.com/surgery.php Surgical Procedures for Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725094926/http://brainphysics.com/surgery.php |date=25 July 2008 }}, by M. Jahn and M. Williams, Ph.D,. BrainPhysics OCD Resource, Accessed 6 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in the United Kingdom, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive–behavioral therapist has been carried out.

=== Children ===
Therapeutic treatment may be effective in reducing ritual behaviors of OCD for children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Donohue William |author2=Ferguson Kyle E | year = 2006 | title = Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology and Behavior Analysis | url = | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 335–347 | doi=10.1037/h0100155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the treatment of adults with OCD, CBT stands as an effective and validated first line of treatment of OCD in children.&lt;ref name=Freeman2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=J|last2=Garcia|first2=A|last3=Frank|first3=H|last4=Benito|first4=K|last5=Conelea|first5=C|last6=Walther|first6=M|last7=Edmunds|first7=J|title=Evidence base update for psychosocial treatments for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder|journal=Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology|date=2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=7–26|pmid=23746138|doi=10.1080/15374416.2013.804386|pmc=3815743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family involvement, in the form of behavioral observations and reports, is a key component to the success of such treatments.&lt;ref name="Rapoport, J. E. 1989"&gt;Rapoport, J. E. (1989). Obsessive-compulsive Disorder In Children &amp; Adolescents. Washington: American Psychiatric Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Parental interventions also provide positive reinforcement for a child who exhibits appropriate behaviors as alternatives to compulsive responses. In a recent meta-analysis of evidenced-based treatment of OCD in children, family-focused individual CBT was labeled as "probably efficacious", establishing it as one of the leading psychosocial treatments for youth with OCD.&lt;ref name=Freeman2014 /&gt; After one or two years of therapy, in which a child learns the nature of his or her obsession and acquires strategies for coping, that child may acquire a larger circle of friends, exhibit less shyness, and become less self-critical.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, P. L. (1973). Obsessive Children: A Sociopsychiatric Study. Philadelphia: Brunner / Mazel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the causes of OCD in younger age groups range from brain abnormalities to psychological preoccupations, life stress such as bullying and traumatic familial deaths may also contribute to childhood cases of OCD, and acknowledging these stressors can play a role in treating the disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid19378573"&gt;{{cite journal | author = D'Alessandro TM | title = Factors influencing the onset of childhood obsessive compulsive disorder | journal = Pediatr Nurs | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19378573 | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obsessive–compulsive disorder affects about 2.3% of people at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Good2014 /&gt; Rates during a given year are about 1.2% and it occurs worldwide.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; It is unusual for symptoms to begin after the age of thirty five and half of people develop problems before twenty.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Males and females are affected about equally.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;

=== Associated conditions ===
People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, as well as or instead of OCD, such as the aforementioned obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen YW, Dilsaver SC | title = Comorbidity for obsessive-compulsive disorder in bipolar and unipolar disorders | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 59 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 57–64 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8771221 | doi = 10.1016/0165-1781(95)02752-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[bulimia nervosa]], [[Tourette syndrome]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[dermatillomania]] (compulsive skin picking), [[body dysmorphic disorder]] and [[trichotillomania]] (hair pulling). More than 50 percent of people experience suicidal tendencies, and 15 percent have attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009" /&gt; Depression, anxiety and prior suicide attempts increase the risk of future suicide attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angelakis|first1=I|last2=Gooding|first2=P|last3=Tarrier|first3=N|last4=Panagioti|first4=M|title=Suicidality in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=July 2015|volume=39|pages=1–15|pmid=25875222|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with OCD have also been found to be affected by [[delayed sleep phase syndrome]] at a substantially higher rate than the general public.&lt;ref name='Turner 2007'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turner J, Drummond LM, Mukhopadhyay S, Ghodse H, White S, Pillay A, Fineberg NA | title = A prospective study of delayed sleep phase syndrome in patients with severe resistant obsessive–compulsive disorder | journal = World Psychiatry | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 108–111 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 18235868 | pmc = 2219909 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, severe OCD symptoms are consistently associated with greater sleep disturbance. Reduced total sleep time and sleep efficiency have been observed in people with OCD, with delayed sleep onset and offset and an increased prevalence of delayed sleep phase disorder.&lt;ref name="Paterson2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paterson JL, Reynolds AC, Ferguson SA, Dawson D | title = Sleep and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) | journal = Sleep Medicine Reviews | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 465–74 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23499210 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2012.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorally, there is some research demonstrating a link between [[drug addiction]] and the disorder as well. For example, there is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with the heightened levels of [[anxiety]]), but drug addiction among people with OCD may serve as a type of [[compulsive behavior]] and not just as a coping mechanism. [[Clinical depression|Depression]] is also extremely prevalent among people with OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other [[anxiety disorder]]) may feel depressed because of an "out of control" type of feeling.&lt;ref name="comorbidity"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mineka S, Watson D, Clark LA | title = Comorbidity of anxiety and unipolar mood disorders | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = |pages = 377–412 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9496627 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone exhibiting OCD signs does not necessarily have OCD. Behaviors that present as (or seem to be) obsessive or compulsive can also be found in a number of other conditions as well, including [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder|obsessive–compulsive ''personality'' disorder]] (OCPD), [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders#Obsessive-compulsive disorder|autism spectrum disorder]], disorders where [[perseveration]] is a possible feature ([[ADHD]], [[PTSD]], bodily disorders or habit problems)&lt;ref name="differential"&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Differential Diagnoses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917123925/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential |date=17 September 2012 }} – 2012&lt;/ref&gt; or sub-clinically.

Some with OCD present with features typically associated with Tourette's syndrome, such as compulsions that may appear to resemble motor tics; this has been termed "tic-related OCD" or "Tourettic OCD".&lt;ref name="10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21.1.59"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mansueto CS, Keuler DJ | title = Tic or compulsion?: it's Tourettic OCD. | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 784–99 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16046664 | doi = 10.1177/0145445505279261 | journal=Behavior Modification}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD and T"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocfoundation.org/eo_ts.aspx |title=OCD and Tourette Syndrome: Re-examining the Relationship |publisher=International OCD Foundation |accessdate=30 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101085624/http://www.ocfoundation.org/eo_ts.aspx |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A myth propagated by Sigmund Freud regarding above-average intelligence in OCD was recently refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11065-017-9358-0 | pmid=28864868 | title=Meta-Analysis of Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder | year=2017 | journal=Neuropsychology Review | volume=28 | issue=1 | pages=111–120 | author=Abramovitch Amitai, Anholt Gideon, Raveh-Gottfried Sagi, Hamo Naama, Abramowitz Jonathan S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCD frequently co-occurs with both [[bipolar disorder]] and [[major depressive disorder]].  Between 60–80% of those with OCD experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime. Comorbidity rates have been reported at between 19–90% due to methodological differences.  Between 9–35% of those with bipolar disorder also have OCD, compared to the 1–2% in the general population. Around 50% of those with OCD experience cyclothymic traits or hypomanic episodes.  OCD is also associated with anxiety disorders.  Lifetime comorbidity for OCD has been reported at 22% for [[specific phobia]], 18% for [[social anxiety disorder]], 12% for panic disorder, and 30% for [[generalized anxiety disorder]].  The comorbidity rate for OCD and ADHD has been reported as high as 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pallanti|first1=S|last2=Grassi|first2=G|last3=Sarrecchia|first3=ED|last4=Cantisani|first4=A|last5=Pellegrini|first5=M|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder comorbidity: clinical assessment and therapeutic implications.|journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry|date=2011|volume=2|pages=70|doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2011.00070|pmid=22203806|pmc=3243905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Quality of life is reduced across all domains in OCD. While psychological or pharmacological treatment can lead to a reduction of OCD symptoms and an increase in QoL, symptoms may persist at moderate levels even following adequate treatment courses, and completely symptom-free periods are uncommon.&lt;ref name="pmid15533282"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eddy KT, Dutra L, Bradley R, Westen D | title = A multidimensional meta-analysis of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1011–30 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15533282 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2004.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Subramaniam|first1=M|last2=Soh|first2=P|last3=Vaingankar|first3=JA|last4=Picco|first4=L|last5=Chong|first5=SA|title=Quality of life in obsessive-compulsive disorder: impact of the disorder and of treatment.|journal=CNS Drugs|date=May 2013|volume=27|issue=5|pages=367–83|doi=10.1007/s40263-013-0056-z|pmid=23580175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In pediatric OCD, around 40% still have the disorder in adulthood, and around 40% qualify for remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boileau|first1=B|title=A review of obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2011|volume=13|issue=4|pages=401–11|pmid=22275846|pmc=3263388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the seventh century AD, [[John Climacus]] records an instance of a young monk plagued by constant and overwhelming "temptations to blasphemy" consulting an older monk,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Osborn|first=Ian|date=1998|title=Tormenting Thoughts and Secret Rituals: The Hidden Epidemic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WVgTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=Obsessive+Compulsive+Disorder+in+antiquity#v=onepage&amp;q=Obsessive%20Compulsive%20Disorder%20in%20antiquity&amp;f=false|location=New York City, New York|publisher=Dell Publishing|isbn=978-0-440-50847-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|212}} who told him, "My son, I take upon myself all the sins which these temptations have led you, or may lead you, to commit. All I require of you is that for the future you pay no attention to them whatosever."&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|212}} ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'', a Christian mystical text from the late fourteenth century, recommends dealing with recurring obsessions by first attempting to ignore them,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} and, if that fails, "cower under them like a poor wretch and a coward overcome in battle, and reckon it to be a waste of your time for you to strive any longer against them",&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} a technique now known as "[[emotional flooding]]".&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}}

From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual or other obsessive thoughts were [[spiritual possession|possessed]] by the [[Satan|Devil]].&lt;ref name="Aardema, F. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aardema F., O'Connor |year = 2007 | title = The menace within: obsessions and the self | url = | journal = International Journal of Cognitive Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 182–197 | doi=10.1891/088983907781494573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the "evil" from the "possessed" person through [[exorcism]].&lt;ref name="Jenike"&gt;M.

The English term obsessive-compulsive comes from the translated term used to describe the first conceptions of OCD by [[Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal|Carl Westphal]], "zwangsvorstellung".  Westphal's description went on to influence [[Pierre Janet]] who further documented features of OCD.&lt;ref name="Sadock" /&gt;  In the early 1910s, [[Sigmund Freud]] attributed obsessive–compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts that manifest as symptoms.&lt;ref name="Jenike" /&gt; Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of "touching phobia" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an "external prohibition" against this type of touching. However, this "prohibition does not succeed in abolishing" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and "force it into the unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Freud S |authorlink=Sigmund Freud |others=trans.

=== Notable cases ===
[[John Bunyan]] (1628–1688), the author of ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', displayed symptoms of OCD (which had not yet been named).&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} During the most severe period of his condition, he would mutter the same phrase over and over again to himself while rocking back and forth.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} He later described his obsessions in his autobiography ''[[Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners]]'',&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} stating, "These things may seem ridiculous to others, even as ridiculous as they were in themselves, but to me they were the most tormenting cogitations."&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|54}} He wrote two pamphlets advising those suffering from similar anxieties.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|217–218}} In one of them, he warns against indulging in compulsions:&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|217–218}} "Have care of putting off your trouble of spirit in the wrong way: by promising to reform yourself and lead a new life, by your performances or duties".&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|218}}

{{For|paternal care in humans|Father}}

In [[biology]], '''paternal care''' is [[parental investment]] provided by a [[male]] or [[female]] animal to their own [[offspring]]. Paternal care may provided in concert with the mother (biparental care) or, more rarely, by the male alone (so called exclusive paternal care).

The provision of care, by either males or females, is presumed to increase growth rates, quality, and/or survival of young, and hence ultimately increase the [[inclusive fitness]] of parents.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, L. 1968.

Many of these biparental species are socially [[Monogamy|monogamous]], so individuals remain with their mate for at least one breeding season.

== Mammals ==

Male mammals may invest heavily in reproduction through efforts to enhance [[reproductive success]] (e.g., [[courtship]] displays, [[Mate choice|intrasexual combat]]) or to provide paternal care. However, the costs of paternal care have rarely been studied in mammals, in large part because only 5-10% of mammals exhibit such care.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman DG, Malcolm JR. 1981. The evolution of male parental investment in mammals. Pp 347-387 in Parental Care in Mammals, Gubernick DJ, Klopfer PH, eds.

For example, mammalian [[fathers]] that care for their young may undergo systematic changes in [[body mass]] and in circulating or excreted concentrations of a number of [[hormones]] (e.g., [[androgens]], [[glucocorticoids]], [[leptin]]) as a function of reproductive status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = JC | last2 = Laugero | first2 = KD | last3 = Van Westerhuyzen | first3 = JA | last4 = Hostetler | first4 = CM | last5 = Cohen | first5 = JD | last6 = Bales | first6 = KL | year = 2009 | title = Costs of pair-bonding and paternal care in male prairie voles (''Microtus ochrogaster'') | url = | journal = Physiol Behav | volume = 98 | issue = | pages = 367–373 | doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2009.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wynne-Edwards"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wynne-Edwards | first1 = KE | last2 = Timonin | first2 = ME | year = 2007 | title = Paternal care in rodents: weakening support for hormonal regulation of the transition to behavioral fatherhood in rodent animal models of biparental care | doi = 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.03.018 | journal = Horm Behav | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 114–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ziegler | first1 = TE | last2 = Prudom | first2 = SL | last3 = Schultz-Darken | first3 = NJ | last4 = Kurian | first4 = AV | last5 = Snowdon | first5 = CT | year = 2006 | title = Pregnancy weight gain: marmoset and tamarin dads show it too | url = | journal = Biol Lett | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 181–183 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0426| pmc = 1483903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and several of these hormones have important effects on [[body composition]], [[metabolism]], and [[organismal performance]].&lt;ref name='Arnold1983'&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Arnold |first=S.

In [[mammals]], paternal care is found most commonly in [[primates]], [[rodents]] and [[canids]].

=== Humans ===
{{Main article|Father}}
Human [[cultures]] and [[societies]] vary widely in the expression of paternal care.  Some cultures recognize paternal care via celebration of [[Father's Day]].  According to CARTA [http://carta.anthropogeny.org/moca/topics/paternal-care|CARTA], human paternal care is a derived characteristic (evolved in humans or our recent ancestors) and one of the defining characteristics of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Different aspects of human paternal care (direct, indirect, fostering social or moral development) may have evolved at different points in our history, and together they form a unique suite of behaviors as compared with the [[great ape]]s.
One study of humans has found evidence suggesting a possible evolutionary trade-off between mating success and parenting involvement; specifically, [[fathers]] with smaller [[testes]] tend to be more involved in care of their [[children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/better-fathers-have-smaller-testicles-1.13701|title=Better fathers have smaller testicles|first=Sarah|last=Zhang|publisher=|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13701|journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on the effects of paternal care on human happiness have yielded conflicting results.  However, one recent study concluded that fathers generally report higher levels of happiness, positive emotion, and meaning in life as compared with non-fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = S. K. | last2 = Kushlev | first2 = K. | last3 = English | first3 = T. | last4 = Dunn | first4 = E.

According to the United States Census Bureau, approximately one third of children in the U.S. grow up without their biological father in their home.  Numerous studies have documented negative consequences of being raised in a home that lacks a father, including increased likelihood of living in poverty, having behavioral problems, committing crimes, spending time in prison, abusing drugs or alcohol, becoming obese, and dropping out of school.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.fatherhood.org/bid/190202/The-Father-Absence-Crisis-in-America-Infographic Accessed 17 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:California mouse 5 Peromyscus californicus.jpg|thumb|right|California mice (''[[Peromyscus californicus]]'') are well known for have intensive and sustained paternal behavior.]]

Several species of rodents have been studied as models of paternal care, including [[prairie vole]]s (''Microtus ochrogaster''), [[Campbell's dwarf hamster]], the [[Mongolian gerbil]], and the [[Rhabdomys|African striped mouse]].  The [[California mouse]] (''Peromyscus californicus'') is a [[Monogamy|monogamous]] rodent that exhibits extensive and essential paternal care, and hence has been studied as a [[model organism]] for this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Trainor, B.

== Birds ==
{{main article|Parental care in birds}}
Fathers contribute equally with mothers to the care of offspring in as many as 90% of [[bird]] species, sometimes including [[Egg incubation#Avian incubation|incubating]] the [[egg (biology)|eggs]].  Most paternal care is associated with biparental care in socially monogamous mating systems (about 81% of species), but in approximately 1% of species, fathers provide all care after eggs are laid.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The unusually high incidence of paternal care in birds compared to other vertebrate taxa is often assumed to stem from the extensive resource requirements for production of flight-capable offspring.  By contrast, in bats (the other extant flying vertebrate lineage), care of offspring is provided by females (although males may help guard pups in some species&lt;ref&gt;Kunz, T.H. &amp; W.R. Hood. 2000.  Parental care and postnatal growth in the Chiroptera.  pp 416-510 in Reproductive Biology of Bats; E. G. Chrichton, &amp; P. H. Krutzsch, Eds.  Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;). In contrast to the large clutch sizes found in many bird species with biparental care, bats typically produce single offspring, which may be a limitation related to lack of male help. It has been suggested, though not without controversy, that paternal care is the ancestral form of parental care in birds.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Amphibians ==
Paternal care occurs in a number of species of anuran amphibians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Morales | first2 = V. | last3 = Summers | first3 = K. | year = 2010 | title = A key ecological trait drove the evolution of biparental care and monogamy in an amphibian | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 175 | issue = | pages = 436–446 | doi=10.1086/650727 | pmid=20180700}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[glass frogs]].

== Fish ==
{{expand section|date=March 2014}}
Paternal care occurs in perhaps as many as half of the known species of certain families of [[teleost]] [[fish]].  One well-known example of paternal care is in [[seahorses]], where males [[Egg incubation|brood]] the eggs in a brood pouch until they are ready to hatch. 

Males from the [[Centrarchidae]] (sunfish) family exhibit paternal parental care of their eggs and fry through a variety of behaviors such as nest guarding and nest fanning (aerating eggs)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BLUMER|first=LAWRENCE S.|date=1982-05-01|title=A bibliography and categorization of bony fishes exhibiting parental care|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-3642.1982.tb01939.x|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1982.tb01939.x|issn=0024-4082}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[jawfish]], the female lays the eggs and the male then takes them in his mouth. A male can have up to 400 eggs in his mouth at one time. The male can't feed while he hosts the young, but as the young get older, they spend more time out of the mouth.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/16251726|author=Taylor, A-L.|title=Shells, trees and bottoms: Strange places fish live|year=2012|publisher=BBC|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes termed [[ mouthbrooding]].

During the breeding season, male [[three-spined stickleback]]s defend nesting territories. Males attract females to spawn in their nests and defend their breeding territory from intruders and predators. After spawning, the female leaves the male's territory and the male is solely responsible for the care of the eggs. During the ~6-day incubation period, the male 'fans' (oxygenates) the eggs, removes rotten eggs and debris, and defends the territory. Even after embryos hatch, father sticklebacks continue to tend their  newly hatched offspring for ~7 days, chasing and retrieving fry that stray from the nest and spitting them back into the nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wootton|first1=Robert|title=A Functional Biology of Sticklebacks|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arthropods ==

E. 2010. Crustacean social evolution, in: Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior. Elsevier, pp. 421–429.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exclusive paternal care, where males provide the sole investment after egg-laying, is the rarest form, and is known in only 13 taxa: giant water bugs, [[sea spider]]s, two genera of [[leaf-footed bugs]], two genera of [[Reduviidae|assassin bugs]], three genera of [[Phlaeothripidae|phlaeothripid thrips]], three genera of harvestmen, and in [[millipedes]] of the family [[Andrognathidae]].&lt;ref name=Tallamy2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tallamy|first=Douglas W.|title=Evolution of exclusive paternal care in arthropods|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|year=2001|volume=46|issue=1|pages=139–165|doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.46.1.139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical models of the evolution of paternal care ==

Mathematical models related to the [[prisoner's dilemma]] suggest that when female reproductive costs are higher than male reproductive costs, males cooperate with females even when they do not reciprocate. In this view, paternal care is an evolutionary achievement that compensates for the higher energy demands that reproduction typically involves for mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Salgado, M. 2013. The Evolution of Paternal Care. Pages 1-10 in A.M. Greenberg, W.G. Kennedy, and N.D. Bos (Eds.): SBP 2013, LNCS 7812. Springer-Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other models suggest that basic life-history differences between males and females are adequate to explain the evolutionary origins of maternal, paternal, and bi-parental care. Specifically, paternal care is more likely if male adult mortality is high, and maternal care is more likely to evolve if female adult mortality is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klug | first1 = H. | last2 = Bonsall | first2 = M.

== Consequences for offspring survival and development ==

Care by fathers can have important consequences for [[Life|survival]] and [[Human development (biology)|development]] of offspring in both humans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-development/how-men-and-children-affect.html|title=How Men and Children Affect Each Other's Development|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other species. Mechanisms underlying such effects may include protecting offspring from predators or environmental extremes (e.g., heat or cold), feeding them or, in some species, direct teaching of skills.  Moreover, some studies indicate a potential epigenetic germline inheritance of
paternal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Curley | first1 = J. P. | last2 = Mashoodh | first2 = R. | last3 = Champagne | first3 = F. A. | year = 2011 | title = Epigenetics and the origins of paternal effects | url = | journal = Hormones and Behavior | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 306–314 | doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.06.018| pmc = 2975825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of paternal care on offspring can be studied in various ways. One way is to compare species that vary in the degree of paternal care. For example, an extended duration of paternal care occurs in the [[gentoo penguin]], as compared with other ''Pygoscelis'' species. It was found that their fledging period, the time between a chick's first trip to sea and its absolute independence from the group, was longer than other penguins of the same genus. The authors hypothesized that this was because it allowed chicks to better develop their foraging skills before becoming completely independent from their parents. By doing so, a chick may have a higher chance of survival and increase the population's overall fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Polito, Michael J., and Wayne Z. Trivelpiece. "Transition to Independence and Evidence of Extended Parental Care in the Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis Papua)." Marine Biology (2008): n. pag. WorldCat@OSU. Web. Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proximate mechanisms ==

The [[Tinbergen's four questions#Proximate explanations|proximate mechanisms]] of paternal care are not well understood for any [[organism]].  In vertebrates, at the level of [[hormonal]] control, [[vasopressin]] apparently underlies the neurochemical basis of paternal care; [[prolactin]] and [[testosterone]] may also be involved.  As with other behaviors that affect [[Darwinian fitness]], [[Reward system|reward pathways]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/reward/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629033932/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/reward/ |archivedate=2013-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[brain]] may reinforce the expression of paternal care and may be involved in the formation of [[Attachment theory|attachment bonds]].

The mechanisms that underlie the onset of parental behaviors in female mammals have been characterized in a variety of species. In mammals, females undergo endocrine changes during gestation and lactation that "prime" [[mothers]] to respond maternally towards their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brunton | first1 = P. | last2 = Russell | first2 = J. | last3 = Douglas | first3 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Adaptive responses of the maternal hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis during pregnancy and lactation | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroendocrinology | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 764–776 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2826.2008.01735.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Numan, M., &amp; Insel, T. R. 2003. The Neurobiology of Parental Behavior. Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paternal males do not undergo these same hormonal changes and so the proximate causes of the onset of parental behaviors must differ from those in females. There is little consensus regarding the processes by which mammalian males begin to express parental behaviors.&lt;ref name="Wynne-Edwards" /&gt;  In humans, evidence ties [[oxytocin]] to sensitive care-giving in both women and men, and with [[affectionate]] infant contact in women and [[Stimulate|stimulatory]] [[infant]] contact in men.  In contrast, testosterone decreases in men who become involved fathers and testosterone may interfere with aspects of paternal care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rilling | first1 = K.

[[Placentophagia]] (the [[behavior]] of [[ingesting]] the [[afterbirth]] after [[parturition]]) has been proposed to have physiological consequences that could facilitate a male's responsiveness to offspring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gregg | first1 = J.

{{Zoroastrianism}}
A '''Peshotanu''', meaning ''one who pays with his body'', according to [[Avesta]]n terminology, is a person who had either been condemned to or previously subjected to two hundred stripes with the ''Aspahe-astra'' and the ''Sraosho-karana''. Two hundred flogs with a whip was a [[capital punishment]] in Ancient Persia next only to death. A Peshotanu was also designated '''margarzan''' or  "worthy of death".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3356">Algorithms said to employ a '''Ping-Pong''' scheme exist in different fields of [[Software Engineering]]. They are characterized by an alternation between two entities. In the examples described below, these entities are communication partners, network paths or file blocks.

==Databases==
In most [[DBMS|database management systems]] [[Durability (database systems)|durable]] [[database transaction]]s are supported through a [[Transaction log|log file]]. However, multiple writes to the same page of that file can produce a slim chance of data loss. Assuming for simplicity that the log file is organized in pages whose size matches the [[Block (data storage)|block]] size of its underlying medium, the following problem can occur:

If the very last page of the log file is only partially filled with data and has to be written to permanent storage in this state, the very same page will have to be overwritten during the next write operation. If a [[Crash (computing)|crash]] happens during that later write operation, previously stored log data may be lost.

The Ping-Pong scheme described in ''Transaction Processing''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jim|last2=Reuter|first2=Andreas|title=Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques|date=1992|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-1-55860-190-1|pages=508-509|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; eliminates this problem by alternately writing the contents of said (logical) last page to two different physical pages inside the log file (the actual last page ''i'' and its empty successor ''i+1''). Once said logical log page is no longer the last page (i.e. it is completely filled with log data), it is written one last time to the regular physical position (''i'') inside the log file.

This scheme requires the usage of time stamps for each page in order to distinguish the most recent version of the logical last page one from its predecessor.

==Networking==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}

===Internet===
A functionality which lets a computer A find out whether a computer B is reachable and responding is built into the [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP). Through an "echo request" Computer A asks B to send back an "Echo response". These two messages are also sometimes called "[[Ping (networking utility)|ping]]" and "pong".

===Routing===
In [[Routing]], a Ping-Pong scheme is a simple algorithm for distributing data packets across
two paths.

If you had two paths &lt;CODE&gt;A&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;B&lt;/CODE&gt;, then the algorithm
would randomly start with one of the paths and then switch back and forth 
between the two.

If you were to get the next path from a function call, it would look like
this in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]:

 &lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;
 
 &lt;span style="color:#006699;"&gt;'''def'''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#9966ff;"&gt;get_next_path&lt;/span&gt;():
     &lt;span style="color:#006699;"&gt;'''while'''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#cc6600;"&gt;'''True'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;:
        &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style="color:#006699;"&gt;'''yield'''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#cd8f8f;"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#cd8f8f;"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#cd8f8f;"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span style="color:#006699;"&gt;'''yield'''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#cd8f8f;"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#cd8f8f;"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#cd8f8f;"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

There are several definitions for '''professional abuse''' and distinctions are usually pronounced in definitions according to professional fields. One of the general descriptions, however, that sought to bridge the variations was put forward by the National Council of Psychotherapists, which explained professional abuse as a violation of an organization's [[Ethical code|code of ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://natcouncilofpsychotherapists.org.uk/Newsletter/Ed001/Professional_Abuse.html|title=Professional Abuse|last=O'Sullivan|first=Michael|date=|website=natcouncilofpsychotherapists.org.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources refer to this as standards of behavior, which include the maintenance of [[professional boundaries]] and the treatment of people with respect and dignity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/guides-to-support-and-services/abuse/abuse-by-health-and-social-care-workers/#.W2mcjNIzbDd|title=Abuse by health and social care workers {{!}} Mind, the mental health charity - help for mental health problems|website=www.mind.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more comprehensive version of this description states that this type of abuse is "a pattern of conduct in which a person abuses, violates, or takes advantage of a victim within the context of the abuser's profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-professional-abuse.htm|title=What Is Professional Abuse?|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional abusers are the individuals who prey on the weaknesses of others in their workplaces or in other places related to economical strands of society. Their fundamental behavior is based in the following actions:

* taking advantage of their client or patient's [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]]
* exploiting their [[vulnerability]]
* not acting in their best interests
* failing to keep [[professional boundaries]]

== Forms of abuse ==
There are many forms of abuse. It may be:
* [[discriminatory]]
* [[Abuse#Financial abuse|financial]]
* [[physical abuse|physical]]
* [[psychological abuse|psychological]]
* [[sexual abuse|sexual]]

Professional abuse always involves:
* [[betrayal]]
* [[wikt:exploit|exploitation]]
* violation of professional boundaries

Professionals can abuse in three ways:
* [[nonfeasance]] - ignore and take no indicated action - neglect.
* [[misfeasance]] - take inappropriate action or give intentionally incorrect advice.
* [[malfeasance]] - hostile, aggressive action taken to injure the client's interests.

== Solutions ==
There are several strategies available to organizations seeking to address professional abuse. A study, for instance, revealed that this problem often arises when there is an extreme power imbalance between the professional and the victim. A framework based on different grades of client empowerment and ways of strengthening it can help solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=S.|date=2000|title=Client empowerment in psychiatry and the professional abuse of clients: where do we stand?|journal=International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine|volume=30|issue=1|pages=61–70|doi=10.2190/AC9N-YTLE-B639-M3P4|issn=0091-2174|pmid=10900561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have been subjected to professional abuse could also pursue any of the following courses of actions: lodging a complaint; reporting abuse to the police; and, taking legal action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are also organizations that can help those who are victimized learn more about their rights and the options available to them.

Within [[computer science]] and [[operations research]],
many [[combinatorial optimization]] problems are computationally [[intractability (complexity)|intractable]] to solve exactly (to optimality).
Many such problems do admit fast ([[polynomial time]]) [[approximation algorithms]]—that is, algorithms that are guaranteed to return an approximately optimal solution given any input.

'''Randomized rounding'''
{{harv|Raghavan|Tompson|1987}}
is a widely used approach for designing and analyzing such [[approximation algorithms]].&lt;ref name="MotwaniRaghavan1995"&gt;

of the problem into an approximately optimal solution to the original problem.

== Overview ==
The basic approach has three steps:
# Formulate the problem to be solved as an [[integer linear program]] (ILP).
# Compute an optimal fractional solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the [[linear programming relaxation]] (LP) of the ILP.
# Round the fractional solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the LP to an integer solution &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; of the ILP.

(Although the approach is most commonly applied with linear programs,
other kinds of relaxations are sometimes used.
For example, see Goeman's and Williamson's [[semi-definite programming]]-based
[[Semi-definite_programming#Example_3_.28Goemans-Williamson_MAX_CUT_approximation_algorithm.29|Max-Cut approximation algorithm]].)

The challenge in the first step is to choose a suitable integer linear program.
Familiarity with linear programming is required, in particular, familiarity with
how to model problems using linear programs and integer linear programs.
But, for many problems, there is a natural integer linear program that works well,
such as in the Set Cover example below.  (The integer linear program should have a small
[[Linear_programming_relaxation#Approximation_and_integrality_gap|integrality gap]];
indeed randomized rounding is often used to prove bounds on integrality gaps.)

In the second step, the optimal fractional solution can typically  be computed
in [[Polynomial_time#Polynomial_time|polynomial time]]
using any standard [[linear programming]] algorithm.

In the third step, the fractional solution must be converted into an integer solution
(and thus a solution to the original problem).
This is called ''rounding'' the fractional solution.
The resulting integer solution should (provably) have cost
not much larger than the cost of the fractional solution.
This will ensure that the cost of the integer solution
is not much larger than the cost of the optimal integer solution.

The main technique used to do the third step (rounding) is to use randomization,
and then to use probabilistic arguments to bound the increase in cost due to the rounding
(following the [[probabilistic method]] from combinatorics).
There, probabilistic arguments are used to show the existence of discrete structures with
desired properties.  In this context, one uses such arguments to show the following:
: ''Given any fractional solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the LP, with positive probability the randomized rounding process produces an integer solution &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; that approximates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'' according to some desired criterion.

Finally, to make the third step computationally efficient,
one either shows that &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; approximates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
with high probability (so that the step can remain randomized)
or one [[Derandomization|derandomizes]] the rounding step,
typically using the [[method of conditional probabilities]].
The latter method converts the randomized rounding process
into an efficient deterministic process that is guaranteed
to reach a good outcome.

== Comparison to other applications of the probabilistic method ==
The randomized rounding step differs from most applications of the [[probabilistic method]] in two respects:
# The [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] of the rounding step is important.  It should be implementable by a fast (e.g. [[polynomial time]]) [[algorithm]].
# The probability distribution underlying the random experiment is a function of the solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of a [[linear programming relaxation|relaxation]] of the problem instance.  This fact is crucial to proving the [[Approximation_algorithm#Performance_guarantees|performance guarantee]] of the approximation algorithm --- that is, that for any problem instance, the algorithm returns a solution that approximates the ''optimal solution for that specific instance''.  In comparison, [[Probabilistic method|applications of the probabilistic method in combinatorics]] typically show the existence of structures whose features depend on other parameters of the input.  For example, consider [[Turán's theorem]], which can be stated as "any [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices of average degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; must have an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] of size at least &lt;math&gt;n/(d+1)&lt;/math&gt;.   (See  [[Method_of_conditional_probabilities#Turán.27s_theorem|this for a probabilistic proof of Turán's theorem]].) While there are graphs for which this bound is tight, there are also graphs which have independent sets much larger than &lt;math&gt;n/(d+1)&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the size of the independent set shown to exist by Turán's theorem in a graph may, in general, be much smaller than the maximum independent set for that graph.

== Set cover example ==
The following example illustrates how randomized rounding can be used to design an approximation algorithm for the [[Set Cover]] problem.

Fix any instance &lt;math&gt;\langle c, \mathcal S\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of set cover over a universe &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;.

For step 1, let IP be the [[set cover#Integer linear program formulation|standard integer linear program for set cover]] for this instance.

For step 2, let LP be the [[linear programming relaxation]] of IP,
and compute an optimal solution &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; to LP
using any standard [[linear programming]] algorithm.
(This takes time polynomial in the input size.)

(The feasible solutions to LP are the vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
that assign each set &lt;math&gt;s \in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;
a non-negative weight &lt;math&gt;x_s&lt;/math&gt;,
such that, for each element &lt;math&gt;e\in\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; ''covers'' &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;
-- the total weight assigned to the sets containing &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;
is at least 1, that is,
:: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\ni e} x_s \ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;
The optimal solution &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;
is a feasible solution whose cost
::  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\in\mathcal S} c(S)x^*_s&lt;/math&gt;
is as small as possible.)

----
Note that any set cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;
gives a feasible solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
(where &lt;math&gt;x_s=1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;x_s=0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise).
The cost of this &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; equals the cost of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, that is,
::  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\in\mathcal C} c(s) = \sum_{s\in\mathcal S} c(s) x_s.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, the linear program LP is a [[linear programming relaxation|relaxation]]
of the given set-cover problem.

Since &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; has minimum cost among feasible solutions to the LP,
''the cost of &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; is a lower bound on the cost of the optimal set cover''.

=== Step 3: The randomized rounding step ===
Here is a description of the third step—the rounding step,
which must convert the minimum-cost fractional set cover &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;
into a feasible integer solution &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; (corresponding to a true set cover).

The rounding step should produce an &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; that, with positive probability,
has cost  within a small factor of the cost of &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Then (since the cost of &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; is a lower bound on the cost of the optimal set cover),
the cost of &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; will be within a small factor of the optimal cost.

As a starting point, consider the most natural rounding scheme:
:: ''For each set &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; in turn, take &lt;math&gt;x'_s = 1&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\min(1,x^*_s)&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise take &lt;math&gt;x'_s = 0&lt;/math&gt;.''

With this rounding scheme,
the expected cost of the chosen sets is at most &lt;math&gt;\sum_s c(s) x^*_s&lt;/math&gt;,
the cost of the fractional cover.
This is good.  Unfortunately the coverage is not good.
When the variables &lt;math&gt;x^*_s&lt;/math&gt; are small,
the probability that an element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is not covered is about

:  &lt;math&gt;
\prod_{s\ni e} 1-x^*_s
\approx
\prod_{s\ni e} \exp(-x^*_s)
=
\exp\Big(-\sum_{s\ni e}x^*_s\Big)
\approx \exp(-1).
&lt;/math&gt;

So only a constant fraction of the elements will be covered in expectation.

To make &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; cover every element with high probability,
the standard rounding scheme
first ''scales up'' the rounding probabilities
by an appropriate factor &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
Here is the standard rounding scheme:
::  ''Fix a parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;.  For each set &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; in turn,''
::  ''take &lt;math&gt;x'_s = 1&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\min(\lambda x^*_s, 1)&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise take &lt;math&gt;x'_s = 0&lt;/math&gt;.''

Scaling the probabilities up by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
increases the expected cost by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;,
but makes coverage of all elements likely.
The idea is to choose &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; as small
as possible so that all elements are provably
covered with non-zero probability.
Here is a detailed analysis.

----

==== Lemma (approximation guarantee for rounding scheme) ====
:: ''Fix &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \ln (2|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt;.  With positive probability, the rounding scheme returns a set cover &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; of cost at most &lt;math&gt;2\ln(2|\mathcal U|) c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt; (and thus of cost &lt;math&gt;O(\log |\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt; times the cost of the optimal set cover).''

(Note: with care the  &lt;math&gt;O(\log |\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt;
can be reduced to &lt;math&gt;\ln(|\mathcal U|)+O(\log\log|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt;.)

==== Proof ====
The output &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; of the random rounding scheme has the desired properties
as long as none of the following "bad" events occur:
# the cost &lt;math&gt;c\cdot x'&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; exceeds &lt;math&gt;2\lambda c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt;, or
# for some element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; fails to cover &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;.

The expectation of each  &lt;math&gt;x'_s&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;\lambda x_s^*&lt;/math&gt;.
By [[Expected_value#Linearity|linearity of expectation]],
the expectation of  &lt;math&gt;c\cdot x'&lt;/math&gt;
is at most &lt;math&gt;\sum_s c(s)\lambda x_s^*=\lambda c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, by [[Markov's inequality]], the probability of the first bad event
above is at most &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

For the remaining bad events (one for each element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;), note that,
since &lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\ni e} x^*_s \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; for any given element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;,
the probability that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is not covered is

:  &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\prod_{s\ni e} \big(1-\min(\lambda x^*_s,1) \big)
&amp; &lt; \prod_{s\ni e} \exp({-}\lambda x^*_s)
= \exp\Big({-}\lambda \sum_{s\ni e} x^*_s \Big)
\\ 
&amp; \le \exp({-}\lambda)
= 1/(2|\mathcal U|).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

(This uses the inequality &lt;math&gt;1+z\le e^z&lt;/math&gt;,
which is strict for &lt;math&gt;z \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;.)

Thus, for each of the &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal U|&lt;/math&gt; elements,
the probability that the element is not covered is less than &lt;math&gt;1/(2\mathcal U)&lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[naive union bound]],
the probability that one of the &lt;math&gt;1+|\mathcal U|&lt;/math&gt; bad events happens
is less than &lt;math&gt;1/2 + |\mathcal U|/(2\mathcal U)=1&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, with positive probability there are no bad events
and &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; is a set cover of cost at most &lt;math&gt;2\lambda c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt;.
QED

=== Derandomization using the method of conditional probabilities ===
&lt;!-- Note: this subsection is linked to from [[method_of_conditional_probabilities]].  
     If you change the title here, please update that link --&gt;

The lemma above shows the ''existence'' of a set cover
of cost &lt;math&gt;O(\log(|\mathcal U|)c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt;).
In this context our goal is an efficient approximation algorithm,
not just an existence proof, so we are not done.

One approach would be to increase &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
a little bit, then show that the probability of success is at least, say, 1/4.
With this modification, repeating the random rounding step a few times
is enough to ensure a successful outcome with high probability.

That approach weakens the approximation ratio.
We next describe a different approach that yields
a deterministic algorithm that is guaranteed to
match the approximation ratio of the existence proof above.
The approach is called the [[method of conditional probabilities]].

The deterministic algorithm emulates the randomized rounding scheme:
it considers each set &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; in turn,
and chooses &lt;math&gt;x'_s \in\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
But instead of making each choice ''randomly'' based on &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;,
it makes the choice ''deterministically'', so as to
''keep the conditional probability of failure, given the choices so far, below 1''.

==== Bounding the conditional probability of failure ====
We want to be able to set each variable &lt;math&gt;x'_s&lt;/math&gt; in turn
so as to keep the conditional probability of failure below 1.
To do this, we need a good bound on the conditional probability of failure.
The bound will come by refining the original existence proof.
That proof implicitly bounds the probability of failure
by the expectation of the random variable
:  &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{c\cdot x'}{2\lambda c\cdot x^*} + |\mathcal U^{(m)}|&lt;/math&gt;, 
where
:  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U^{(m)}= \Big\{ e  : \prod_{s\ni e} (1-x'_s) = 1\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;
is the set of elements left uncovered at the end.

The random variable &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; may appear a bit mysterious,
but it mirrors the probabilistic proof in a systematic way.
The first term in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; comes from applying [[Markov's inequality]]
to bound the probability of the first bad event (the cost is too high).
It contributes at least 1 to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; if the cost of &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; is too high.
The second term
counts the number of bad events of the second kind (uncovered elements).
It contributes at least 1 to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; leaves any element uncovered.
Thus, in any outcome where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is less than 1,
&lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; must cover all the elements
and have cost meeting the desired bound from the lemma.
In short, if the rounding step fails, then &lt;math&gt;F \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;.
This implies (by [[Markov's inequality]]) that
''&lt;math&gt;E[F]&lt;/math&gt; is an upper bound on the probability of failure.''
Note that the argument above is implicit already in the proof of the lemma,
which also shows by calculation that &lt;math&gt;E[F] &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

To apply the method of conditional probabilities,
we need to extend the argument to bound the ''conditional'' probability of failure
as the rounding step proceeds.
Usually, this can be done in a systematic way,
although it can be technically tedious.

So, what about the ''conditional'' probability of failure as the rounding step iterates through the sets?
Since &lt;math&gt;F \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; in any outcome where the rounding step fails,
by [[Markov's inequality]], the ''conditional'' probability of failure
is at most the ''conditional'' expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

Next we calculate the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
much as we calculated the unconditioned expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in the original proof.
Consider the state of the rounding process at the end of some iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt; denote the sets considered so far
(the first &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;).
Let &lt;math&gt;x^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt; denote the (partially assigned) vector &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;
(so &lt;math&gt;x^{(t)}_s&lt;/math&gt; is determined only if &lt;math&gt;s\in S^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt;).
For each set &lt;math&gt;s\not\in S^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt;,
let &lt;math&gt;p_s = \min(\lambda x^*_s, 1)&lt;/math&gt;
denote the probability with which &lt;math&gt;x'_s&lt;/math&gt; will be set to 1.
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt; contain the not-yet-covered elements.
Then the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
given the choices made so far, that is, given &lt;math&gt;x^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, is

: &lt;math&gt;
E[F | x^{(t)}]
~=~
\frac{\sum_{s\in S^{(t)}} c(s) x'_s 
+ \sum_{s\not\in S^{(t)}} c(s) p_s}{2\lambda c\cdot x^*}
~+~
\sum_{e\in \mathcal U^{(t)}}\prod_{s\not\in S^{(t)}, s\ni e} (1-p_s).
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;E[F | x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt; is determined only after iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Keeping the conditional probability of failure below 1 ====
To keep the conditional probability of failure below 1,
it suffices to keep the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; below 1.
To do this, it suffices to keep the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; from increasing.
This is what the algorithm will do.
It will set &lt;math&gt;x'_s&lt;/math&gt; in each iteration to ensure that
:: &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(m)}] \le E[F|x^{(m-1)}] \le \cdots \le E[F|x^{(1)}] \le E[F|x^{(0)}] &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;
(where &lt;math&gt;m=|\mathcal S|&lt;/math&gt;).

In the &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;th iteration,
how can the algorithm set &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
to ensure that &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t)}] \le E[F|S^{(t-1)}]&lt;/math&gt;?
It turns out that it can simply set &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
so as to ''minimize'' the resulting value of &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;.

To see why, focus on the point in time when iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; starts.
At that time, &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t-1)}]&lt;/math&gt; is determined,
but &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt; is not yet determined
--- it can take two possible values depending on how &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
is set in iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;E^{(t-1)}&lt;/math&gt; denote the value of &lt;math&gt;E[F|x'^{(t-1)}]&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;E^{(t)}_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^{(t)}_1&lt;/math&gt;,
denote the two possible values of  &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;,
depending on whether &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt; is set to 0, or 1, respectively.
By the definition of conditional expectation,
:: &lt;math&gt;
E^{(t-1)} ~=~ 
\Pr[x'_{s'}=0] E^{(t)}_0
+
\Pr[x'_{s'}=1] E^{(t)}_1.
&lt;/math&gt;
Since a weighted average of two quantities
is always at least the minimum of those two quantities,
it follows that
:: &lt;math&gt;
E^{(t-1)} ~\ge~ \min( E^{(t)}_0, E^{(t)}_1 ).
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, setting &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
so as to minimize the resulting value of
&lt;math&gt;E[F | x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;
will guarantee that
&lt;math&gt;E[F | x^{(t)}] \le E[F | x^{(t-1)}]&lt;/math&gt;.
This is what the algorithm will do.

In detail, what does this mean?
Considered as a function of &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
(with all other quantities fixed)
&lt;math&gt;E[F | x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;
is a linear function of &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;,
and the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt; in that function is
:   &lt;math&gt;\frac{c_{s'}}{2\lambda c\cdot x^*}
~-~
\sum_{e\in s'\cap \mathcal U_{t-1}}\prod_{s\not\in S^{(t)}, s\ni e} (1-p_s).
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the algorithm should set &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt; to 0 if this expression is positive,
and 1 otherwise.  This gives the following algorithm.

# Return &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;.

==== lemma (approximation guarantee for algorithm) ====

:: ''The algorithm above returns a set cover &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; of cost at most &lt;math&gt;2\ln(2|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt; times the minimum cost of any (fractional) set cover.''

==== proof ====
----
The algorithm ensures that the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;E[F \,|\, x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;, does not increase at each iteration.
Since this conditional expectation is initially less than 1 (as shown previously),
the algorithm ensures that the conditional expectation stays below 1.
Since the conditional probability of failure
is at most the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
in this way the algorithm
ensures that the conditional probability of failure stays below 1.
Thus, at the end, when all choices are determined,
the algorithm reaches a successful outcome.
That is, the algorithm above returns a set cover &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;
of cost at most &lt;math&gt;2\ln(2|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt; times
the minimum cost of any (fractional) set cover.

=== Remarks ===
In the example above, the algorithm was guided by the conditional expectation of a random variable &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.
In some cases, instead of an exact conditional expectation,
an ''upper bound'' (or sometimes a lower bound)
on some conditional expectation is used instead.
This is called a [[pessimistic estimator]].

The '''virtuality continuum''' is a continuous scale ranging between the completely virtual, a [[Virtual Reality|virtuality]], and the completely real, [[reality]]. The '''reality–virtuality continuum''' therefore encompasses all possible variations and compositions of real and [[Virtuality|virtual]] objects. It has been described as a concept in [[new media]] and [[computer science]], but in fact it could be considered a matter of [[anthropology]].{{clarify|date=October 2013}}{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  The concept was first introduced by Paul Milgram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Paul |last=Milgram |author2=H. Takemura |author3=A. Utsumi |author4=F. Kishino  |title=Augmented Reality: A class of displays on the reality-virtuality continuum |booktitle=Proceedings of Telemanipulator and Telepresence Technologies |pages=2351–34 |year=1994 |url=http://etclab.mie.utoronto.ca/publication/1994/Milgram_Takemura_SPIE1994.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2007-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area between the two extremes, where both the real and the virtual are mixed, is called [[mixed reality]]. This in turn is said to consist of both [[augmented reality]], where the virtual augments the real, and [[augmented virtuality]], where the real augments the virtual.

==Overview==
[[File:Mediated reality continuum 2d.png|thumb|left|300px|Mediated reality continuum showing four points: augmented reality, augmented virtuality, mediated reality, and mediated virtuality on the virtuality and mediality axes|alt=Mann's Continuum]]

This continuum has been extended into a two-dimensional plane of ''virtuality'' and ''mediality''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wearcam.org/presence_connect/ Mediated Reality with implementations for everyday life], 2002 August 6th, Presence Connect, the on line companion to the MIT Press journal PRESENCE: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Taxonomy of reality, virtuality, mediality. The origin R denotes unmodified reality. A continuum across the virtuality axis, V, includes reality augmented with graphics (augmented reality), as well as graphics augmented by reality (augmented virtuality). However, the taxonomy also includes modification of reality or virtuality or any combination of these.  

The mediality axis denotes changes  The modification is denoted by moving up the mediality axis. Further up this axis, for example, we can find mediated reality, mediated virtuality, or any combination of these. Further up and to the right, we have virtual worlds that are responsive to a severely modified version of reality. 

[[Augmented reality]] and [[mixed reality]] are now sometimes used as synonyms.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The virtuality continuum has grown and progressed past labels such as [[computer science]] and [[new media]]. As the concept has much to do with the way in which humans continue to change how they communicate; the way in which identities form and the way in which they interact to and within the world; it is more accurately described as a subject within [[anthropology]].{{OR|date=March 2015}}

Changes in attitudes towards and the increase in availability of technology and media have changed and progressed the way it is used. One to one (SMS), one to many (email), and many to many (chat rooms), have become ingrained in society. The use of such items have made once clear distinctions like ''online'' and ''offline'' obsolete, and the distinctions between reality and virtuality have become blurred as people are incorporating and relying heavily upon virtuality within their everyday personal realities.{{OR|date=March 2015}}

[[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]] and Don Slater are prominent researchers pursuing the concept of the virtuality continuum and the media and its effect on communities, especially in the Caribbean, most notably Trinidad and Jamaica.

[[Steve Woolgar]] is another researcher who has established four rules of virtuality. These are:
*The way in which media and technology affect people relies on their non-[[information communication technology]] (ICT) related background which may include gender, age, social status, income amongst others.
*Risks and fears in regards to new media and technology are unevenly socially distributed.
*Advancements in media and technology supplement rather than replace existing activities in reality.
*New media and technology tends to create new kinds of localism rather than furthering globalization.

'''Schwa''' is the [[Underground art|underground]] [[conceptual art]]work of Bill Barker (born 1957).  Barker draws deceptively simple [[black and white]] [[stick figure]]s and oblong [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] ships.  However the artwork is not about the aliens: it is about how people react to the presence of the aliens and branding and Barker uses them as a metaphor for foreign and unknown ideas. Schwa became an underground hit in the 1990s.

== Artwork and themes ==

In [[linguistics]], a [[schwa]] is an unstressed and toneless neutral vowel sound in any language, often but not necessarily a mid-central vowel (rounded or unrounded). Such vowels are often transcribed with the symbol '''ə''', regardless of their actual phonetic value. An example in English is the ''a'' in ''about''.

For Barker, Schwa is alternately his [[pseudonym]], a fictitious [[omnipresent]] [[corporation]], a [[religion]], or a [[resistance movement]] against corporate [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracies]] and aliens.  Often it's a combination of all four at once.

Schwa artwork is black and white, with very precise stick-figures and ovoid alien faces and ships.  The aliens themselves are rarely seen by the human stick figures, their presence is more often felt by their distant ships.  The people are almost always either very frightened, or very complacent with their lot in life.  Barker combines aliens, corporations, [[religion]]s, [[Mass media|media]], and even the passage of time in his drawings.

The black and white drawings lead to a very [[hypnotic]] and very stark landscape.  The world of Schwa is consistent throughout his work, and all the drawings and books combine to paint a single picture of a futuristic world run by large corporate and religious conglomerates who are possibly in league with omnipresent aliens.  The media has become a marketing machine for these overseers, and they continually saturate the world with alien logos and messages like ''"In the future, everything will work"'', and, ''"Stop domesticating yourself"''.

== History ==

Schwa began in 1992 when Barker, a former [[advertising]] art director, was looking for a way to express himself with a single art style when he was given a copy of ''The Secret Government'', a conspiracy book that tells of aliens controlling the government.  Barker did not like the idea of art exhibitions, which he saw as just a pretentious form of merchandising, so he decided to sell merchandise directly to consumers by [[mail-order]].  Barker started selling trinkets like necklaces and stickers, and his first book, ''ə'', exclusively through this home-grown business. Schwa cartoons also appeared in ''[[The Sagebrush]]'', the [[University of Nevada, Reno]] student newspaper.

Although Barker might not have been the first person to conceive of the ovoid alien face, his version quickly became the best-known.  His book was an underground hit, and received praise from [[Terry Gilliam]], [[Ivan Stang]], and [[Noam Chomsky]].  He bundled the book along with several trinkets as the ''Complete Schwa Kit'' ({{ISBN|0-9635914-1-X}}), and put out another book with trinkets as ''Complete Counter-Schwa Kit'' ({{ISBN|0-9635914-2-8}}).

Eventually his popularity led to a book deal with [[Chronicle Books]], and in 1997 published ''Schwa: World Operations Manual'' ({{ISBN|0-8118-1585-4}}) a reference manual for world control that included postcards, stickers, warranties, contracts, and charts.

Barker also created and ran a (now defunct) labyrinthine website early in the days of the World Wide Web.  He described it as "an experiment in building an online science fiction environment in HTML."  Instead of simply showcasing his printed artwork, the website became another medium for Schwa fans to explore.

== Schwa Pyramid ==
Barker teamed up with [[AOL]] to create an odd online game exclusively for AOL members.  He worked with the now defunct Orbital Studios to create a game about conspiracies, corporations, and aliens.  The initial instructions set the tone of the game:

:''"Don't follow instructions. Suspect instructions. They are something to be wary of."''

The player was a stick figure right in the middle of the darkened and conspiratorial world of Schwa.  The player worked his way up the pyramid by collecting power through media, corporations, government, and labor, to eventually dominate the world.

The game launched on March 9, 1998.  A follow-up game called '''Schwa Conspiracy''' was announced for later that year, but was never finished.

== Current status ==

Although a growing hit, Bill Barker disappeared from the public (and underground) eye sometime in late September 2001. His long-running website is dead and the post office box he had used for years now returns his mail unread.

In April 2008 a Schwa trademark was re-registered (assigned by Compuwatcher, Inc.) and a small series of websites were launched; this new Schwa business has no affiliation with Bill Barker or his artwork.

In March 2012 Barker created a Facebook page under the name alaVoid, which does not seem to be updated anymore.

[[File:Britain Before the First World War Q81841.jpg|thumb|Racegoers attending [[Royal Ascot]] in [[England]], [[United Kingdom]], before the [[First World war]].]]
The '''social season''', or '''season''', refers to the traditional annual period when it is customary for members of a social [[elite]] of society to hold [[ball (dance)|balls]], [[Party#Dinner party|dinner parties]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]] events. Until [[World War I]], it was also the appropriate time to be resident in the city rather than in the country in order to attend such events.

In modern times in the [[United Kingdom]], "the Season" is known to encompass various prestigious events that take place during the spring and summer. According to [http://www.sloaneyseason.com Sloaney Season], it starts with [[Cheltenham Festival]] (March), and includes [[Grand National]] (April), [[Badminton Horse Trials]] (May), [[Chelsea Flower Show]] (May), [[Epsom Derby]], [[Royal Ascot]], [[Henley Royal Regatta]] (July), and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cheltenham Festival marks the start of Sloaney Season |url=https://www.thesloaney.com/events/cheltenham-festival-2018.html |work=The Sloaney |date=13 March 2018 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social season of London==

The London social season evolved in the 17th and 18th centuries, and in its traditional form it peaked in the 19th century.  In this era the British elite was dominated by landowning aristocratic and [[gentry]] families who generally regarded their [[country house]] as their main home, but spent several months of the year in the capital to socialise and to engage in [[British politics|politics]]. The most exclusive events were held at the town [[mansion]]s of leading members of the aristocracy. Exclusive public venues such as [[Almack's]] played a secondary role. The Season coincided with the sitting of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] and began some time after [[Christmas]] and ran until [[midsummer]], roughly late June.&lt;ref&gt;'The Social Character of the Estate: The London Season in 1841′, Survey of London: volume 39: The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 1 (General History) (1977), pp. 89-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social season played a role in the political life of the country: the members of the two [[Houses of Parliament]] were almost all participants in the season. But the Season also provided an opportunity for the children of marriageable age of the [[nobility]] and [[gentry]] to be launched into society. [[Debutantes]] were formally introduced into society by presentation to the monarch at [[British royal court|royal court]] until it was abolished by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1958. 

The traditional Season went into decline after the [[First World War]], when many aristocratic families gave up their London mansions. From this time on an increasing number of society events took place at public venues, making it harder to maintain social exclusivity.

Many events that take place far from [[central London]] came to be regarded as part of the social season, including [[Royal Ascot]] and the [[Henley Royal Regatta]]. The events that now constitute the London social season are increasingly hosted or sponsored by large companies (i.e. "corporate hospitality"). [[Western dress codes]] still apply to certain events in the season, especially where the Queen maintains an official role.

According to the [[peerage]] guide [[Debrett's]], the traditional social season runs from April to August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.debretts.com/social-season/the-traditional-season.aspx |title=Traditional Season |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Debrett's |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.thesloaney.com The Sloaney] runs a detailed guide to the British Social Season, known as [http://www.sloaneyseason.com Sloaney Season]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thesloaney.com/the-season-a-guide-to-the-british-summer-social-season |title=The Season: Our leading guide to the British Summer Social Season |publisher=The Sloaney |accessdate=6 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sloaneyseason.com/about-us |title=Sloaney Season|publisher=Sloaney Season |accessdate=6 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05zhhht |title=Morning Brief: Today Programme|publisher=BBC |accessdate=6 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although several of these events are not actually held in London, such as the [[Hurlingham Polo Association]] at [[Guards Polo Club]], the organisers of most events attempt to avoid date clashes, so it is generally possible to visit all of them in the same year.

The traditional end of the London Season is the [[Glorious Twelfth]] of August, which marks the beginning of the [[Hunting and shooting in the United Kingdom|shooting]] season. Society would retire to the country to [[shoot birds]] during the autumn and [[fox hunting|hunt foxes]] during the winter before coming back to London again with the spring.

===Dress codes===
Many events of the season have traditional expectations with regard to [[Western dress codes]].
*At [[Royal Ascot]], for example, [[hat]]s are compulsory in most enclosures, and to be admitted to the Royal Enclosure for the first time one must either be a guest of a member or be sponsored for membership by two members who have attended for at least six years as a member. This continues to maintain a socially exclusive character to the Royal Enclosure. If permitted to enter, gentlemen are required to wear either black or grey [[morning dress]] with [[waistcoat]] and a [[top hat]]. A gentleman may remove his top hat within a restaurant, a private box, a private club or that facility's terrace, balcony or garden. Hats may also be removed within any enclosed external seating area within the Royal Enclosure Garden. Ladies must not show bare midriffs or shoulders and must wear hats. In the Queen Anne Enclosure (Formerly known as the Grandstand), gentlemen are required to wear [[lounge suit]]s with [[Necktie|ties]] and ladies must wear a hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ascot.co.uk/royal/enclosure.html |title=Royal Ascot 14-18th June 2011 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Royal Ascot |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*At [[Henley Royal Regatta]], in the [[Henley Royal Regatta#Stewards' Enclosure|Stewards' Enclosure]] gentlemen must wear a [[lounge jacket]] and tie. Rowing club colours on a blazer or cap are encouraged, as is the wearing of [[boater]]s. A lady's skirt hem must reach below the knee and is checked before entry by the Stewards' Officers and both ladies and gentlemen will be turned away if they fail to comply with the dress code, no matter their prestige in rowing or elsewhere. Hats are encouraged but not required for ladies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/fashionnews/5700665/What-to-wear-Henley-Royal-Regatta.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=What to wear: Henley Royal Regatta | first=Olivia | last=Bergin | date=July 1, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a student protested being denied entry to the Stewards' Enclosure for failing to meet the dress code, saying she had worn the dress "in the Royal Enclosure at Ascot and nobody said anything," a spokesman defended the dress code saying "The intention is to maintain the atmosphere of an English Garden party of the [[Edwardian period]] by wearing a more traditional dress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5712444/Student-falls-foul-of-Henley-Royal-Regatta-dress-code-wearing-Ascot-outfit.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Student falls foul of Henley Royal Regatta dress code wearing Ascot outfit | first=Murray | last=Wardrop | date=July 2, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members must display their enamel [[badge]]s at all times. Anyone found using a [[mobile phone]] is asked to leave immediately and their Stewards' Enclosure host, identified by the number on the guests badge, may have his membership withdrawn as a result.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
*At [[Polo|polo matches]], it is usual for gentlemen to wear a [[blazer]] and always white trousers. Ladies should wear flat shoes, as the tradition of "treading in the divots" precludes wearing heels. The famous Club House at [[Guards Polo Club]] in [[Windsor Great Park]] is for the use of club members only, who wear individually made gold and enamel badges. Members' guests are given special gold-embossed tags.

==In popular culture==
*A London Season features in [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' and is often a key plot device in [[Regency romance]] novels.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
*The novel ''[[Mapp and Lucia|Lucia in London]]'' by [[E. F. Benson]] is set during the London season in the 1920s.
*[[Edith Wharton]]'s ''[[The Age of Innocence]]'' uses the [[New York City|New York]] social season as a backdrop.
*The novel ''[[The Leopard]]'' by [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa]], and the ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|film]]'' by [[Luchino Visconti]], portray the [[Palermo|Palermitan]] season during the [[Risorgimento]].
*[[Julian Fellowes]]'s novel ''Past Imperfect'' takes place during the 1968 season in London.
*In the 2003 film ''[[What a Girl Wants (film)|What a Girl Wants]]'', Lord Henry Dashwood invites his new-found daughter Daphne to attend the London Season.
*The 2009 young-adult novel ''The Season'' by [[Sarah MacLean]] portrays a young woman entering her first London Season.
*[[Vincente Minnelli]]'s ''[[The Reluctant Debutante (film)|The Reluctant Debutante]]''
*The British [[period drama]] ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' the outspoken youngest daughter of the  fictional [[Earl of Grantham]], Lady Sybil, is presented as a [[debutante]] at court in London during her first season. The family are also portrayed to move to London for the duration of the season, returning to their country seat at the end of it. The show's 2013 Christmas Special (set in the summer of 1923) focuses on cousin Lady Rose McClare's [[debutante ball]] and presentation at court.
*[[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'', ''[[An Ideal Husband]]'', and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.
* In [[The Crimson Petal and the White|Michel Faber's The Crimson Petal and the White]], the Season is part and parcel of the plot.
*The ''Malory-Anderson Family Saga Series'' of historical romance novels by [[Johanna Lindsey]] is set primarily in London, the first one opening up in 1817. Throughout the series, one Season or another, and the balls thrown during them, are mentioned in dialogue, to being central to the plot lines themselves.
*[[Honoré de Balzac]]'s novel The Muse of the Department contains a description of the London Season:
&lt;blockquote&gt;London is the capital of shops and of speculation, the government is made there. The aristocracy inscribes itself there only during sixty days, it there takes its orders, it inspects the government kitchen, it passes in review its daughters to marry, and equipages to sell, it says good-day and goes away promptly ; - it is so little amusing that it supports itself only for the few days called the season.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*Most of the [[Regency Romance]] novels by [[Georgette Heyer]] features the London Season.
*The Royal Ascot racecourse was used as a filming location in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' (1985), where Bond (played for the last time by [[Roger Moore]]) was beginning his mission to defeat the villainous [[Max Zorin]] ([[Christopher Walken]]), whose horse was racing there.

[[Memory]] is one of the brain’s most critical functions. It has the infinite ability to store information about events and experiences that occur constantly.&lt;ref name=Pinel2&gt;Pinel, J.P.J., &amp; Edwards, M. (2008). A colorful introduction to the anatomy of the human brain: A brain and psychology coloring book (2nd ed.). USA: Pearson.2&lt;/ref&gt; Experiences shape the way memories form, so  major stressors on socioeconomic status can impact memory development. [[Socioeconomic status]] (SES) is a measurement of social standing based on income, education, and other factors.&lt;ref name=siegler&gt;Siegler, R., Eisenberg, N., DeLoache, J., Saffran, J., &amp; Graham, S. (2014). How Children Develop (4th ed. New York: Worth.&lt;/ref&gt; Socioeconomic status can differ cross-culturally, but is also commonly seen within cultures themselves. It influences all spectrums of a child’s life, including cognitive development, which is in a crucial and malleable state during early stages of childhood.  In Canada, most children grow up in agreeable circumstances, however an unfortunate 8.1% are raised in households that fall into the category of low socioeconomic status. These children are at risk for many disadvantages in life, including deficits in memory processing, as well as problems in language development.&lt;ref name=siegler/&gt;

==Working Memory==
Working memory is a temporary storage system that is essential for the successful performance of the task at hand.&lt;ref name="Pinel"&gt;Pinel, J.P.J (2014). Biopsychology (9th ed.). Boston: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain Functions===

====Hippocampus====
When creating new memories, the [[hippocampus]] and related structures of the brain play a key role in consolidation. Memory consolidation is the transformation of short-term memories to long-term memories,&lt;ref name="Pinel"/&gt; which is crucial in the acquisition of new ideas. Until they can be stored more permanently, these memories are temporarily kept in the hippocampus in a process known as Standard Consolidation Theory. From childhood the hippocampus is developing, and it continues to mature beyond adolescents. A major barrier when it comes to studying working memory development in childhood is that much of the data come from adults who recall on past events of their childhood, and not from the children themselves.&lt;ref name=howe&gt;Howe, M. L., Cicchetti, D., Toth, S. L., &amp; Cerrito, B. M. (2004). True and false memories in maltreated children. Child Development,75(5), 1402-1417. doi:10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00748.x&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a problem in memory recall of those events that occurred when the hippocampus was still developing, and the working memory wasn’t completely consolidated at the time. As people recall a former memory, the door to memory reconsolidation is opened.  Reconsolidation refers to the retrieval of a memory from long-term storage to short-term working memory, where it is unstable and vulnerable to alteration.&lt;ref name="Pinel"/&gt; As reported by Staff et al. (2012), socioeconomic status measured early in childhood reared a significant difference in hippocampal size in adulthood, suggesting that there is in fact an impact on brain and cognitive development.&lt;ref name=Staff&gt;Staff, R. T., Murray, A. D., Ahearn, T. S., Mustafa, N., Fox, H. C., &amp; Whalley, L. J.(2012). Childhood socioeconomic status and adult brain size: Childhood socioeconomic status influences adult hippocampal size. Annals of Neurology, 71(5), 653-660. doi:10.1002/ana.22631.&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial memory is another specialized function of the brain, and more specifically, the hippocampus. Spatial memory refers to experiences that are recognized by their surrounding environment. Many of hippocampal neurons are in fact [[place cells]]. Place cells are neurons that are activated by certain locations or environments.&lt;ref name="Pinel"/&gt; If a child is constantly in a maladaptive environment, their hippocampal neurons may be performing poorly, and memory development may be sacrificed.

====Amygdala====
The [[amygdala]] is another structure of the brain that is involved memory development. The amygdala’s role in memory formation is to extract the emotional significance of experiences,&lt;ref name="Pinel"/&gt; which may be positive or negative emotions. Children who grow up in positive households, develop to convey more positive emotions, than children who group up in negative households.&lt;ref name=siegler/&gt; Lower socioeconomic status generally increases tension and negative emotions within a household, which may impact the emotional memory development of the children via the amygdala. A lack of positive emotional development may impact memory development as well as continual cognitive development in other areas, such as sociability and depression. 
Child development and socioeconomic status (SES) are positively correlated, especially with regards to the child’s working memory.&lt;ref name=hackman&gt;Hackman, D. A., Betancourt, L. M., Gallop, R., Romer, D., Brodsky, N. L., Hurt, H., &amp; Farah, M. J. (2014). Mapping the trajectory of socioeconomic disparity in working memory: Parental and neighborhood factors. Child Development, 85(4), 1433-1445. doi:10.1111/cdev.12242&lt;/ref&gt; Low socioeconomic status environments with a high stress factor can increase the memory processing for a particular unpleasant event.&lt;ref name="howe"/&gt; However, just because memory processes are firing, it doesn’t mean that the information stored is valid or accurate. Stressful environments impair a child’s memories and increase the probability for reconsolidation and contamination of false information. False memories are recollections of events that did not truly occur. Older children are most likely to confabulate these false memories and illusions, than younger children.&lt;ref name="howe"/&gt; This may be because their memory and learning processes are more developed than younger children’s’, which allows them to reconstruct memories based on real events as well as imaginary ones.

==Parental Influence==
Learning and memory go hand-in-hand, as one cannot occur without the other. Learning involves experiences and how they alter the brain, while memory focuses on how those changes in the brain are stored and recalled.&lt;ref name="Pinel"/&gt; Lower socioeconomic status environments yield lower cognitive and intellectual development in children.&lt;ref name=siegler/&gt; Since children cannot choose the environments that they are raised in, parental influence can greatly aid or inhibit a child’s cognitive development. Low socioeconomic status due to poverty is a leading cause in hindered cognitive development in growing children. A constant inadequate diet throughout early childhood deprives the brain of the nourishment it requires to develop and function successfully.&lt;ref name=siegler/&gt; Also affecting cognitive development is access to health care. Families with a low socioeconomic status cannot always afford necessary or beneficial health care for their children, which can hinder brain development, especially in later years when the brain is less likely to self-correct potential risk factors.&lt;ref name="Pinel"/&gt; A lack of intellectual stimulation can also decrease cognitive development in children, which can occur in households with a low income, that cannot afford supplementary activities or programs for their children’s developing minds. One of the most dynamic inhibitors of cognitive development by parental influence however, is parental violence and negativity. Children who live in high-risk environments of parental abuse express fluctuations in their ability of attentional skills due to constant fear or safety concerns.&lt;ref name=gustafsson&gt;Gustafsson, H. C., Coffman, J. L., Harris, L. S., Langley, H. A., Ornstein, P. A., &amp; Cox, M. J. (2013). Intimate partner violence and children’s memory. Journal of Family Psychology 27(6), 937-944. doi: 10.1037/a0034592&lt;/ref&gt; Disturbance in attention can decrease both working memory and retrieval of long-term memories. If concentration is disturbed during recall, the memories that surface may be susceptible to reconsolidation, and the false memories that are created, due to lack of concentration, may solidify into inaccurate long-term memories. In a research model that looked at children living in environments of domestic violence and their relationship with memory, researchers found that children exposed to familial trauma displayed a poorer performance of working memory.&lt;ref name="gustafsson"/&gt;

==Education==

Low working memory is becoming more of an issue today with children in the public school system. The education system plays a substantial part in developing the children’s mind for working memory. However, families who are in the low socio-economic status can’t always afford private school to provide the children with the highest quality of teachers and learning. A disadvantage to having children in public school system is that educators don’t have time, the right tools or proper techniques to train the children to develop better working memory. Public schools are at a disadvantage when it comes to receiving the best education for working memory.&lt;ref name=egnel&gt;Engel de Abreu, P. J., Nikaedo, C., Abreu, N., Tourinho, C. J., Miranda, M. C., Bueno, O. A., &amp; Martin, R. (2014). Working Memory Screening, School Context, and Socioeconomic Status: An Analysis of the Effectiveness of the Working Memory Rating Scale in Brazil. Journal of Attention Disorders, 18(4), 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who live in a low SES homes have difficulty learning how to develop and train the working memory. Working memory has slowly decreased over the growing years. Therefore, students become less motivated and have learning difficulties later on. Low working memory results in frustration, anger, being disruptive and failure to complete tasks.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;Davis, N., Sheldon, L., &amp; Colmar, S. (2014). Memory Mates: A Classroom-Based Intervention to Improve Attention and Working Memory. Australian Journal of Guidance &amp; Counselling, 24(1), 111-120. doi:10.1017/jgc.2013.23&lt;/ref&gt; Some effects to students having a low working memory is they can be very easily distracted, low attention span, as well as forgetfulness. Children that grow up in a higher SES, can afford to have a better education.

==Language Development==

Working memory gives the ability to keep languages, [[vocabulary]] and apt [[symbols]] readily available for communication with others and organization of thoughts. All of human kind utilizes language, and thus it has been widely recognized that children from areas of [[socioeconomic]] disadvantage are at high risk of delayed language development.&lt;ref name=spencer&gt;Spencer, S., Clegg, J., &amp; Stackhouse, J. (2012). Language and disadvantage: A comparison of the language abilities of adolescents from two different socioeconomic areas. International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders, 47(3), 274-284.0 doi:10.1111/j.1460-6984.2011.0104.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents from higher SES tend to be of higher education and therefore understand more about child development and the necessities for proper growth. For this reason, parents from high SES homes are more likely to see themselves as teacher figures and their children as students ready to learn.&lt;ref&gt;Johsnon, J., &amp; Marting, C. (1985). Parents’ beliefs and home learning environments: Effects on cognitive development. In I.E. Single (Ed.),  Parental belief systems: The psychological consequences for children (pp. 25-49). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===

Socioeconomic disadvantages have created unequal differences among educational attainments for children and families from various socioeconomic backgrounds. Differences between parent to child [[dialogue]] differs in homes of Low to High SES families. In homes of low SES children, there tends to be less direct conversation with the child, fewer opportunities of book reading and much less time shared between child and parent about the same subject or event.&lt;ref name=Garett&gt;Garrett-Peters, P., Mills-Koonce, R., Adkins, D., Vernon-Feagans, L., &amp; The Family Life Project Key Investigators. (2008). Early environmental correlates of maternal emotion talk. Parenting, Science and Practice, 8, 117-152. doi:10.1080/15295190802058900&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of dialogue slows the understanding of [[Syntax]] as children receive less opportunities to learn and understand the arrangement of their language.&lt;ref name=hoff&gt;Hoff, E. (2003). The Specificity of environmental influence: Socioeconomic status affects early vocabulary development via maternal speech.  Child Development, 74, 1368-1378. do:10.111/1467-8624.00612&lt;/ref&gt; In homes of high SES children, mothers tend to speak more freely with their children about [[emotions]] and feelings,&lt;ref name="Garett"/&gt; as well as attempt to directly follow up with what their children are saying. This proper and consistent verbal stimulation may add to a stronger verbal development than children from low SES families.

Considering language development is key for children to begin to convey themselves, grow and eventually detach from parents, it is important to display the differences among different socio-economic standings. In environments where children are spoken to and pushed practice words, first words tend to develop between 10–15 months.&lt;ref name=siegler/&gt; North American Children are some of the most typically studied families, they come from middle class families with mothers who influence language development. Mothers from these families often use object-labelling for their infants. This allows children to use phonological reference by giving meaning and association to the words spoken by their mothers.&lt;ref name=siegler/&gt;

Children from low SES families who have had the unfair disadvantage of starting behind in language development do not tend to catch up, the delays may stay stable or increase in strength with age.&lt;ref name="hoff"/&gt; In adolescence these delays are still present in children from Low SES families. Studies with 13-14 year olds from High and Low SES areas have indeed suggested that delayed language development is still very apparent in children from low SES families. Studies also found that children in areas of low SES were more likely than High SES children to have undetected language difficulties.&lt;ref name="spencer"/&gt; Considering children from low SES families may never catch up to children in High SES families it is important to detect language difficulties much earlier than adolescents. In [[adolescents]] language growth has slowed and dramatic language accomplishments are less likely to occur.&lt;ref name=siegler/&gt;

===Bilingualism===
Bilingualism refers to the ability to use and understand two simultaneous languages. A [[bilingual]] person can for instance speak and understand both [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]. In 2011, Canadians recorded having 17% of the population being bilingual with 20% of them speaking a language other than French or English prior to learning French or English.&lt;ref name=statistics&gt;Statistics Canada. (2012a). 20111 census of population: Linguistic Characteristics of Canadians. Retrieved from http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/121024/dq121024a-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to working memory and cognitive control, bilingual children have been found to achieve much higher scores than those of monolingual children.&lt;ref name=morton&gt;Morton, J. B., &amp; Harper, S. N. (2007). What did Simon say? Revisiting the bilingual advantage. Developmental Science, 10(6), 719-726. doi:10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00623.x&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monolingual]] children have however outperformed bilinguals in standard vocabulary assessments.&lt;ref name=Deabreu&gt;De Abreu, P. E. (2011). Working memory in multilingual children: Is there a bilingual effect?. Memory, 19(5), 529-537. doi:10.1080/09658211.2011.590504&lt;/ref&gt; Past research with High SES children suggests that both languages are constantly present in bilinguals and that this may account for the reduced efficiency in either language abilities.&lt;ref name="Deabreu"/&gt;&lt;ref name=costa&gt;Costa, A., Roelstraete, B., &amp; Hartsuiker, R. (2006). The lexical bas effect in bilingual speech production: Evidence for feedback between lexical and sub lexical levels across languages. Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 13, 612-617.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to monolinguals,  Low SES bilingual children are at risk of under performing at one or both languages,&lt;ref name="Garett"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dixon&gt;Dixon, L. Q., Wu, S., &amp; Daraghmeh, A. (2012). Profiles in bilingualism: Factors influencing kindergartners’ language proficiency. Early Childhood Education Journal, 40(1), 25-34. doi:10.1007/s10643-011-0491-8&lt;/ref&gt; however there are exceptions, few outliers of Low SES children tend to achieve high proficiency scores in both languages.&lt;ref name="dixon"/&gt; Low SES children show preferential strength towards ethnic languages spoken at home.&lt;ref name="dixon"/&gt; Language development is largely dependent on parental interaction,&lt;ref name="Garett"/&gt; therefore children with monolingual parents struggle learning the second language due to a home environment which is restricted to their ethnic language.&lt;ref name="dixon"/&gt; However if the parents are bilingual in the same languages, children are likely to out perform all bilingual children regardless of SES. Middle to High SES bilingual children have also been found to underachieve linguistically compared to Monolingual children of the same SES.&lt;ref name="morton"/&gt; Middle to High SES children however show consistent higher proficiency than Low SES children at either language.&lt;ref name="dixon"/&gt;

==Autism==
The main diagnoses for children with [[Autism Spectrum Disorder]] (ASD) have issues with communication skills, social interactions and patterns of activity.&lt;ref name=gabig&gt;Gabig, C. (2008). Verbal working memory and story retelling in school-age children with autism. Language, Speech &amp; Hearing Services In Schools, 39(4), 498-511.&lt;/ref&gt;  Children with high-functioning autism as well as low-functioning autism have impairments to their working memory, both verbal and non-verbal domains as well as language development.&lt;ref name=schuh&gt;Schuh, J. M., &amp; Eigst, I. (2012). Working Memory, Language Skills, and Autism Symptomatology. Behavioral Sciences (2076-328X), 2(4), 207-218. doi:10.3390/bs2040207&lt;/ref&gt; Families with a child with ASD, and that are also in a higher socio-economic status (SES) often can provide more funding for the child to receive the proper treatment to help the child develop.&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;Thomas, P., Zahorodny, W., Peng, B., Kim, S., Jani, N., Halperin, W., &amp; Brimacombe, M. (2012). The Association of Autism Diagnosis with Socioeconomic Status. Autism: The International Journal of Research and Practice, 16(2), 201-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Families with a higher SES have access to better health care and behavior intervention programs to help the child develop normally. One of the treatments would include a program to help improve short-term, long-term and also, working memory. When children with ASD are at the early stages of development, working memory impairments is not always recognizable, consequently they do not get the appropriate training right away. Parents of children with ASD and are in the low SES group, they generally don’t have the education or the resources to help the child with working memory impairment and [[language deficits]].&lt;ref name="thomas"/&gt; Result of children with ASD had difficulties with short-term working memory, spatial working memory and also complex verbal memory.&lt;ref name="schuh"/&gt;

===Durkin et al===
{{Main|Socioeconomic Inquality in the Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder: Evidence from a U.S. Cross-Sectional Study}}&lt;ref name=durkin&gt;Durkin, M. S., Maenner, M. J., Meaney, F. J., Levy, S. E., DiGuiseppi, C., Nicholas, J. S., &amp; ... Schieve, L. A. (2010). Socioeconomic Inequality in the Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder: Evidence from a U.S. Cross-Sectional Study. PLoS One, 5(7), 1-8. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0011551&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Maureen Durkin, who is involved in the health sciences department at the University of Wisconsin, did a [[cross-sectional study]] to see if there was any [[correlation]] between children who are born with autism and socioeconomic status. This study was designed to see if socioeconomic status has any association with children who are born with autism spectrum disorder. Durkin and associates discovered that children born in low SES family and the births of autistic children are increasing. Although, there were some limitations to this study; ADDM Network surveillance system. Durkin et al based their research on this system, it's a system where children with disabilities have access to diagnostic services. Therefore, autistic children in low SES, may not have access to the same. Another limitation this study has is that this study took part in children that were eight years old rather than when they were first diagnosed. This would have an effect on the outcome as some families who might be in a high SES, may use all the funds to help the child towards intervention programs and may leave the family in a low SES in the long run. Families that are in high SES, are well educated, and have the financial resources to pay for the highest quality of education for their child. Durkin et al also found that good or low SES had to do with race and ethnicity.&lt;ref name="durkin"/&gt;

==Working Memory Measures==

===Psychometrics===
[[File:Baddeley and Hitch's Working Memory Model.png|thumb|300px|Baddeley and Hitch's working memory model.]]
Scores on working memory measures have determined a strong association between working memory and language learning [[disabilities]].&lt;ref name= archibald&gt;Archibald, L. M.D., &amp; Gathercole, S.E. (2006). Nonword repetition: a comparison of tests. Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 87, 85-106.&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are very useful in measuring a child’s working memory and or learning disabilities. Research shows studies of working memory can predict a child’s scholastic abilities for up to three years later.&lt;ref name= gathercole&gt;Gathercole, S. E., Brown, L., &amp; Pickering, S. J. (2003). Working memory assessments at school entry as [[longitudinal study|longitudinal]] predictors of National Curriculum attainment levels. Educational and Child Psychology, 20, 109-122&lt;/ref&gt; Considering low SES is largely related to learning and language disabilities it is important to validate whether measures for such topics are free of socioeconomic influences.

The phonological loop is used by working memory to acquire and associate new vocabulary with existing vocabulary knowledge. Use of non-word repetition to measure the [[phonological loop]] has proven a strong predictor of learning disabilities in children learning language. These [[standardized]] language tests may pose more problems for children coming from Low SES families than children from Normal to High SES. Parent interaction, or the role of a caregiver in the home are of utmost important when developing vocabulary knowledge and strengthening the phonological loop.&lt;ref name=siegler/&gt; Typically, in low SES homes parent interaction, extracurriculars and social environment are limited, this slows the child’s development of vocabulary compared to children of normal to high SES. Working memory involves the memory system, which actively attends to gathering and organizing new information. It is a constant running memory system that aids memory storage and association.&lt;ref name=siegler/&gt; Learning languages makes use of the working memory, however the strength of the working memory does not determine one’s ability for vocabulary knowledge.&lt;ref name= engel&gt;Engel, P. J., Santos, F. H., &amp; Gathercole, S. E. (2008). Are working memory measures free of socioeconomic influence?. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, 51(6), 1580-1587. doi:10.1044/1092-4388(2008/07-0210)&lt;/ref&gt; To distinguish children’s scores between [[Educational assessment|assessments]], which study vocabulary, and those that study working memory, studies have had [[Cohort (statistics)|cohorts]] from both low SES and high SES families complete a battery of working memory measures.&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt; Indeed measurements of children’s vocabulary knowledge reinforced past research on the impact a child’s environment can have on their language learning. Measurements for non-word repetition and digit recall however showed no difference among scores between children of either High or Low SES. These findings dictate that measurements purely involved in working memory and not associated with vocabulary are free of socioeconomic influence. Working memory is unaffected by SES, however learning disabilities are still largely associated with Low SES.&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt; Researchers can assume that working memory measurements are not biased to SES and can properly assess language development and other learning problems. The applicability of this knowledge proves especially useful in determining needs for early [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] in children’s learning environments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8994">'''Strict scrutiny''' is the most stringent standard of [[judicial review]] used by [[United States]] courts. It is part of the hierarchy of standards that courts use to determine which is weightier, a constitutional right or principle or the government's interest against observance of the principle. The lesser standards are [[rational basis review]] and exacting or [[intermediate scrutiny]]. These standards are used to test statutes and government action at all levels of government within the United States.

The notion of "levels of judicial scrutiny", including strict scrutiny, was introduced in [[United States v. Carolene Products Co.#Footnote Four|Footnote 4]] of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' (1938), one of a series of decisions testing the constitutionality of [[New Deal]] legislation. The first and most notable case in which the Supreme Court applied the strict scrutiny standard and found the government's actions constitutional was ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' (1944), in which the Court upheld the exclusion of [[Japanese American]]s from designated areas during [[World War II]].

== Applicability ==
U.S. courts apply the strict scrutiny standard in two contexts: when a fundamental constitutional right is infringed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/410/113/case.html Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 155 (1973) (Blackmun, J.)], accessed July 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those found in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and those the court has deemed a [[fundamental right]] protected by the [[Due Process Clause]] or "liberty clause" of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], or when a government action applies to a "[[suspect classification]]", such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[national origin]]. 

To pass strict scrutiny, the law or policy must satisfy three tests:

* It must be justified by a [[government interest|compelling governmental interest]]. While the Courts have never [[bright line rule|brightly defined]] how to determine if an interest is compelling, the concept generally refers to something necessary or crucial, as opposed to something merely preferred. Examples include national security, preserving the lives of a large number of individuals, and not violating explicit constitutional protections.
* The law or policy must be [[narrow tailoring|narrowly tailored]] to achieve that goal or interest. If the government action encompasses too much ([[overbreadth doctrine|overbroad]]) or fails to address essential aspects of the compelling interest, then the rule is not considered narrowly tailored.
* The law or policy must be the least restrictive means for achieving that interest: there must not be a less restrictive way to effectively achieve the compelling government interest. The test will be met even if there is another method that is equally the least restrictive. Some legal scholars consider this "least restrictive means" requirement part of being narrowly tailored, but the Court generally evaluates it separately.

Legal scholars, including judges and professors, often say that strict scrutiny is "strict in theory, fatal in fact" since popular perception is that most laws subjected to the standard are struck down. However, an empirical study of strict scrutiny decisions in the federal courts found that laws survive strict scrutiny more than 30% of the time. In one area of law, religious liberty, laws that burden religious liberty survived strict scrutiny review in nearly 60% of cases. However, a discrepancy was found in the type of religious liberty claim, with most claims for exemption from law failing and no allegedly discriminatory laws surviving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=897360 Adam Winkler, "Fatal in Theory and Strict in Fact: An Empirical Analysis of Strict Scrutiny in the Federal Courts", ''Vanderbilt Law Review", Vol. 59, p. 793, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; See also the cases cited below, however; several appear to permit the exemption from laws based upon religious liberty.

The compelling state interest test is distinguishable from the [[rational basis]] test, which involves claims that do not involve a suspect class and involve a [[liberty interest]] rather than a fundamental right. It is also important to note that unlike the [[rational basis]] test, the burden of proof falls on the state, in cases that require strict scrutiny or [[intermediate scrutiny]].

==Suspect classification==
{{Main article|Suspect classification}}
The Supreme Court has established standards for determining whether a statute or policy's classification requires the use of strict scrutiny. The class must have experienced a history of discrimination, must be definable as a group based on "obvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics," be a minority or "politically powerless," and its characteristics must have little relationship to the government's policy aims or the ability of the group's members to contribute to society.[Citations needed.]

The Court has consistently found that classifications based on race, national origin, and alienage require strict scrutiny review. The Supreme Court held that all race-based classifications must be subjected to strict scrutiny in ''[[Adarand Constructors v. Peña]],'' 515 U.S. 200 (1995), overruling ''[[Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC]]'' (89-453), 497 U.S. 547 (1990), which had briefly allowed the use of intermediate scrutiny to analyze the Equal Protection implications of race-based classifications in the narrow category of affirmative-action programs established by the federal government in the broadcasting field.

==''De jure'' versus ''de facto'' discrimination==
As applied in ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', which upheld the race-based [[Executive Order 9066|exclusion order]] and internment during [[World War II]] of [[Japanese American]]s who had resided on the West Coast of the United States, strict scrutiny was limited to instances of ''[[de jure]]'' discrimination, where a racial classification is written into the language of a statute.

The Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.]]'' provided further definition to the concept of intent and clarified three particular areas in which intent of a particular administrative or legislative decision becomes apparent, the presence of any of which demands the harsher equal protection test. The Court must use strict scrutiny if one of these tests, among others, is met:
# the impact is so "stark and dramatic" as to be unexplainable on non-racial grounds, as in ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]''
# the historical background of the decision suggests intent
# the legislative and administrative records leading up to the decision show intent

=== Notable cases ===
*''[[Skinner v. Oklahoma|Skinner v. State of Oklahoma]], [[ex rel|ex. rel.]] Williamson'', [[Case citation|316 U.S. 535]] (1942), cf. ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'' {{ussc|274|200|1927}}, banning [[Compulsory sterilization|forced sterilization]]
*''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', 347 U.S. 483 (1954), ending [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in public schools
*''[[One, Inc. v. Olesen]]'', 301 U.S. 340 (1958), ending censorship of homosexual publications
*''[[Sherbert v. Verner]]'', 374 U.S. 398 (1963), allowing someone fired because of religious conflicts to receive unemployment
*''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', 381 U.S. 479 (1965), allowing the use of [[birth control]]
*''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', 897 U.S. 113 (1967), allowing people of different races to marry
*''[[Wisconsin v. Yoder]]'', 406 U.S. 205 (1972), allowing the [[Amish]] to remove their children from public schools after 8th grade

*''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'', 494 U.S. 872 (1990), allowing states to deny unemployment benefits to those using illegal drugs for religious purposes
*''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', 380 U.S. 144 (1996), allowing local governments in Colorado to pass discrimination protections for homosexuals
*''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'', 521 U.S. 507 (1997), holding that some zoning laws may be an undue restriction of religious freedom

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4634">In [[structural anthropology]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], a French [[anthropologist]], makes the claim that "myth is language". Through approaching [[mythology]] as language, Lévi-Strauss suggests that it can be approached the same way as language can be approached by the same structuralist methods used to address language. Thus, Lévi-Strauss offers a '''structuralist theory of mythology''';&lt;ref&gt;[[Markus Gabriel]], [[Slavoj Žižek]], ''Mythology, Madness, and Laughter: Subjectivity in German Idealism'', Continuum, 2009, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; he clarifies, "Myth is language, functioning on an especially high level where meaning succeeds practically at 'taking off' from the linguistic ground on which it keeps rolling."&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Anthropology'', p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
Lévi-Strauss breaks down his argument into three main parts. Meaning is not isolated within the specific fundamental parts of the myth, but rather within the composition of these parts. Although myth and language are of similar categories, language functions differently in myth. Finally, language in myth exhibits more complex functions than in any other linguistic expression. From these suggestions, he draws the conclusion that myth can be broken down into constituent units, and these units are different from the constituents of language. Finally, unlike the constituents of language, the constituents of a myth, which he labels “mythemes,” function as "bundles of relations."&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Anthropology'', p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; 

This approach is a break from the “symbolists”, such as [[Carl Jung]], who dedicate themselves to find meaning solely within the constituents rather than their relations.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Hanéff, ''Claude Lévi-Strauss, p. 160''&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Lévi-Strauss uses the example of the Oedipus myth and breaks it down to its component parts:

Reading it in sequence from left to right, top to bottom, the myth is categorized sequentially and by similarities. Through analyzing the commonalities between the “mythemes” of the [[Oedipus]] story, understandings can be wrought from its categories. 

Thus, a structural approach towards myths is to address all of these constituents. Furthermore, a structural approach should account for all versions of a myth, as all versions are relevant to the function of the myth as a whole. This leads to what Lévi-Strauss calls a spiral growth of the myth which is continuous while the structure itself is not. The growth of the myth only ends when the 
“intellectual impulse which has produced it is exhausted.”&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Anthropology'', p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; 

== From mythology to literary criticism ==

Myths are primarily acknowledged as oral traditions, while literature is in the form of written text. Still, anthropologists and [[literary critics]] would both acknowledge the links between myths and relatively more contemporary literature. Therefore, many literary critics take the same Lévi-Straussian structuralist, as it is coined, approach to literature. This approach is, again, similar to [[Symbolist]] critics’ approach to literature. There is a search for the lowest constituent of the story. But as with the myth, Lévi-Straussian structuralism then analyzes the relations between these constituent parts in order to compare even greater relations between versions of stories as well as among stories themselves.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Boon, ''From Symbolism to Structuralism. p. 6-12.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, Lévi-Strauss suggests that the structural approach and mental processes dedicated towards analyzing the myth are similar in nature to those in science. This connection between myth and science is further elaborated in his books, “Myth and Meaning” and "The Savage Mind". He suggests that the foundation of structuralism is based upon an innate understanding of the scientific process, which seeks to break down complex phenomena into its component parts and then analyze the relations between them. The structuralist approach to myth is precisely the same method, and as a method this can be readily applied to literature.&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Meaning p.5-14''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''TWERPS''''' ('''''The World's Easiest Role-Playing System''''') is a minimalist [[role-playing game]] (RPG) originally created by Reindeer Games (whose sole product was the ''TWERPS'' line) and distributed by [[Lou Zocchi|Gamescience]]. Presented as a parody of the complicated RPG systems which were prevalent at the time while still being a playable game in its own right, its simple structure and humorous nature gave it unexpected popularity. ''TWERPS'' was originally created, written and illustrated (in a distinctive cartoony style) by [[Jeff Dee|"Jeff &amp; 'Manda Dee"]], Jeff Dee being a noted game illustrator and co-writer of ''[[Villains and Vigilantes]]''.

==Publication history==
''TWERPS'' was designed by [[Jeff Dee]] and 'Manda Dee, and published by Reindeer Games in 1987 as a digest-sized 8-page pamphlet, with four cardstock sheets.&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schick |first=Lawrence|authorlink=Lawrence Schick|title=Heroic Worlds: A History and Guide to Role-Playing Games|publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1991|isbn=0-87975-653-5|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''TWERPS'' is a humorous universal system of minimalist rules; ''"TWERPS"'' stands for "The World's Easiest Role-Playing System".&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; Characters have only one ability, Strength.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; Rules sections cover Strength, Combat, and "How to Do Everything."&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; The game includes a sample character sheet, a combat hex sheet, cardstock miniatures, and an introductory micro-mini-scenario.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt;

The actual rules of the game are indeed extremely simple. Characters are defined by a single attribute, "Strength", which is used for determining all traditional role-playing elements, such as whether or not the character successfully hits in combat, how fast they can move and how much damage they can take before dying. A de facto skill system exists in the form of "character classes" which give numerical bonuses to certain activities if their role called for it (for instance, a pilot having a +1 modifier on their roll to fly an aircraft).

== First Edition ''TWERPS'' titles ==
Originally each installment of the ''TWERPS'' system was sold in a small plastic bag containing an 8-page leaflet, a sheet of cardstock counters to be cut apart, little cardstock hex-maps and a tiny [[Ten-sided dice|ten-sided die]], each being a down-sized imitation of elements often found in larger, more elaborate games. The initial run of titles was printed at low cost with black ink on various colored papers to distinguish the various titles (the main rules were on pink paper, the kung-fu rules were on yellow, and so on).

*''TWERPS Basic Rules'': the core system, including the sample adventure "Watery Depths".
*''Fly By Knights'': a fantasy setting, describing very succinctly the world of Arkosa where characters ride various breeds of aerial mounts, stalk the fearsome Meganocerous and vie for knighthood.
*''Magic'': a rules expansion outlining a surprisingly detailed (for TWERPS anyway) magic system and spell-list.
*''Space Cadets'': guidelines for a space opera setting, in the form of various types of character classes, SF weaponry and psychic powers. Basic rules for vehicles were included.
*''Kung Fu Dragons'': a list of various martial arts which characters could train in and a system of colored belts to reward them. One of the cardstock extras was a tiny [[Gamemaster's screen|Game-master's screen]].

==Second Edition ''TWERPS'' titles==
As the game grew in popularity, the supplements were re-printed in expanded form with more pages and multi-color printing. New supplements covering new genres and specific objects of parody were also added. These expansions and later supplements were mainly written by Norman F. Morin Jr., Brian Rayburn, Jon Hancock and Niels Erickson rather than Jeff &amp; 'Manda Dee. The tone of these second edition titles was noticeably one of more overt humor and silliness, peppering the text with [[pun]]s (and even calling on fans to mail in suggested puns of their own for future supplements).

*All of the First Edition titles described above were reprinted in expanded full-color form.
*''Rocket Rangers'': the companion to ''Space Cadets'', this volume offered systems for spaceship design and combat and several sample ships. Unlike other 2nd edition titles, ''Rocket Rangers'' was mainly written by Jeff &amp; 'Manda Dee.
*''Twerps Twek'': a direct parody of [[Star Trek]], requiring ''Space Cadets'' and ''Rocket Rangers'' to use.
*''Robo-Punks'': rules for running [[Cyberpunk]] adventures, including brief systems for cybernetic implants and net-running.
*''Superdudes'': a list of super-powers for running [[superhero]] adventures.
*''Metaphysical Ninja Maniac Chainsaw Vitamin Junkies'': guidelines for running [[post-apocalyptic]] scenarios in the spirit of films like ''[[Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior|The Road Warrior]]'' (with a heavy addition of gonzo wackiness), including rules for vehicle damage and mutations.
*''Twisted Tales of Terror'': the horror supplement, with guidelines for creating monsters or playing monsters as [[player-character]]s.
*''M.E.C.H.I.-Tech'': a system for the design and battles between giant robots, with many direct riffs on the popular [[Battletech]] games.
*''The T.W.E.R.P.S. Files'': a direct parody of ''[[The X Files]]''.
*''How to Do Everything Better'': a general rules expansion, offering more character classes, more superpowers and more equipment. Also included were rules for allowing ''TWERPS'' characters to gain dimension-travelling powers.

{{About|tautology in formal logic||Tautology (disambiguation)}}
In [[logic]], a '''tautology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ταυτολογία) is a [[well-formed formula|formula]] or assertion that is true in every possible [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]. A simple example is "(x equals y) or (x does not equal y)" (or as a less abstract example, "The ball is green or the ball is not green").

[[Philosopher]] [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] first applied the term to redundancies of [[propositional logic]] in 1921. (It had been used earlier to refer to [[tautology (rhetoric)|rhetorical tautologies]], and continues to be used in that alternative sense.) A formula is [[Satisfiability and validity|satisfiable]] if it is true under at least one interpretation, and thus a tautology is a formula whose negation is unsatisfiable. Unsatisfiable statements, both through negation and affirmation, are known formally as [[contradiction]]s. A formula that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is said to be [[Contingency (philosophy)|logically contingent]]. Such a formula can be made either true or false based on the values assigned to its propositional variables.  The [[double turnstile]] notation &lt;math&gt;\vDash S&lt;/math&gt; is used to indicate that ''S'' is a tautology.  Tautology is sometimes symbolized by "V''pq''", and contradiction by "O''pq''".  The [[tee (symbol)|tee]] symbol &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used to denote an arbitrary tautology, with the dual symbol &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; ([[falsum]]) representing an arbitrary contradiction; in any symbolism, a tautology may be substituted for the truth value "[[Logical truth|true]]," as symbolized, for instance, by "1."

Tautologies are a key concept in [[propositional logic]], where a tautology is defined as a propositional formula that is true under any possible Boolean valuation of its [[propositional variable]]s. A key property of tautologies in propositional logic is that an [[effective method]] exists for testing whether a given formula is always satisfied (or, equivalently, whether its negation is unsatisfiable).

The definition of ''tautology'' can be extended to sentences in [[predicate logic]], which may contain [[Quantification (logic)|quantifiers]], unlike sentences of propositional logic. In propositional logic, there is no distinction between a tautology and a [[Validity (logic)|logically valid]] formula. In the context of [[predicate logic]], many authors define a tautology to be a sentence that can be obtained by taking a tautology of propositional logic and uniformly replacing each propositional variable by a first-order formula (one formula per propositional variable). The set of such formulas is a [[proper subset]] of the set of logically valid sentences of predicate logic (which are the sentences that are true in every [[structure (mathematical logic)|model]]).

==History==
The word ''tautology'' was used by the ancient Greeks to describe a statement that was asserted to be true merely by virtue of saying the same thing twice, a pejorative meaning that is still used for [[tautology (rhetoric)|rhetorical tautologies]]. Between 1800 and 1940, the word gained new meaning in logic, and is currently used in [[mathematical logic]] to denote a certain type of propositional formula, without the pejorative connotations it originally possessed.&lt;!-- remainder of this section sourced to Dreben and Floyd; will add more sources later.
Logical positivism became an issue according to Dr.Kowalsky and Dr.Rodgers since it held as neither a tautology nor empirically verifiable. Due to this issue it was in fact excluded from further definitions of science by those that followed in the philosophical scientific footsteps. Despite this there are still scientists today that feel that logical positivism (relying mainly on tautology) is still valid.
--&gt;

In 1800, [[Immanuel Kant]] wrote in his book ''Logic'':
:"The identity of concepts in analytical judgments can be either ''explicit'' (''explicita'') or ''non-explicit'' (''implicita''). In the former case analytic propositions are ''tautological.''"
Here ''analytic proposition'' refers to an [[analytic truth]], a statement in natural language that is true solely because of the terms involved.

In 1884, [[Gottlob Frege]] proposed in his ''Grundlagen'' that a truth is analytic exactly if it can be derived using logic. But he maintained a distinction between analytic truths (those true based only on the meanings of their terms) and tautologies (statements devoid of content).

In 1921, in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed that statements that can be deduced by logical deduction are tautological (empty of meaning) as well as being analytic truths. [[Henri Poincaré]] had made similar remarks in ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' in 1905. Although [[Bertrand Russell]] at first argued against these remarks by Wittgenstein and Poincaré, claiming that mathematical truths were not only non-tautologous but were [[synthetic truth|synthetic]], he later spoke in favor of them in 1918:
:"Everything that is a proposition of logic has got to be in some sense or the other like a tautology. It has got to be something that has some peculiar quality, which I do not know how to define, that belongs to logical propositions but not to others."
Here ''logical proposition'' refers to a proposition that is provable using the laws of logic.

During the 1930s, the formalization of the semantics of propositional logic in terms of truth assignments was developed. The term ''tautology'' began to be applied to those propositional formulas that are true regardless of the truth or falsity of their propositional variables. Some early books on logic (such as ''Symbolic Logic'' by [[C. I. Lewis]] and Langford, 1932) used the term for any proposition (in any formal logic) that is universally valid. It is common in presentations after this (such as [[Stephen Kleene]] 1967 and [[Herbert Enderton]] 2002) to use ''tautology'' to refer to a logically valid propositional formula, but to maintain a distinction between ''tautology'' and ''logically valid'' in the context of first-order logic (see [[Tautology (logic)#Tautologies versus validities in first-order logic|below]]).

==Background==
{{Main|propositional logic}}

Propositional logic begins with '''propositional variables''', atomic units that represent concrete propositions. A '''formula''' consists of propositional variables connected by logical connectives, built up in such a way that the truth of the overall formula can be deduced from the truth or falsity of each variable. A '''valuation''' is a function that assigns each propositional variable either T (for truth) or F (for falsity). So, for example, using the propositional variables ''A'' and ''B'', the binary connectives &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; representing [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] and [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] respectively, and the unary connective &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; representing [[negation]], the following formula can be obtained::&lt;math&gt;(A \land B) \lor (\lnot A) \lor (\lnot B)&lt;/math&gt;.
A valuation here must assign to each of ''A'' and ''B'' either T or F. But no matter how this assignment is made, the overall formula will come out true. For if the first conjunction &lt;math&gt;(A \land B)&lt;/math&gt; is not satisfied by a particular valuation, then one of ''A'' and ''B'' is assigned F, which will cause the corresponding later disjunct to be T.

==Definition and examples==
A formula of propositional logic is a '''tautology''' if the formula itself is always true regardless of which valuation is used for the propositional variables.

There are infinitely many tautologies. Examples include:
*&lt;math&gt;(A \lor \lnot A)&lt;/math&gt; ("''A'' or not ''A''"), the [[law of the excluded middle]]. This formula has only one propositional variable, ''A''. Any valuation for this formula must, by definition, assign ''A'' one of the truth values ''true'' or ''false'', and assign &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;''A'' the other truth value.
*&lt;math&gt;(A \to B) \Leftrightarrow (\lnot B \to \lnot A)&lt;/math&gt; ("if ''A'' implies ''B'', then not-''B'' implies not-''A''", and vice versa), which expresses the law of [[contraposition]].
*&lt;math&gt;((\lnot A \to B) \land (\lnot A \to \lnot B)) \to A&lt;/math&gt; ("if not-''A'' implies both ''B'' and its negation not-''B'', then not-''A'' must be false, then ''A'' must be true"), which is the principle known as ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''.
*&lt;math&gt;\lnot(A \land B) \Leftrightarrow (\lnot A \lor \lnot B)&lt;/math&gt; ("if not both ''A'' and ''B'', then not-''A'' or not-''B''", and vice versa), which is known as [[De Morgan's law]].
*&lt;math&gt;((A \to B) \land (B \to C)) \to (A \to C)&lt;/math&gt; ("if ''A'' implies ''B'' and ''B'' implies ''C'', then ''A'' implies ''C''"), which is the principle known as [[syllogism]].
*&lt;math&gt;((A \lor B) \land (A \to C) \land (B \to C)) \to C&lt;/math&gt; ("if at least one of ''A'' or ''B'' is true, and each implies ''C'', then ''C'' must be true as well"), which is the principle known as [[proof by cases]].

A minimal tautology is a tautology that is not the instance of a shorter tautology.
*&lt;math&gt;(A \lor B) \to (A \lor B)&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology, but not a minimal one, because it is an instantiation of &lt;math&gt;C \to C&lt;/math&gt;.

==Verifying tautologies==
The problem of determining whether a formula is a tautology is fundamental in propositional logic. If there are ''n'' variables occurring in a formula then there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; distinct valuations for the formula. Therefore, the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite, mechanical one: one need only evaluate the [[truth value]] of the formula under each of its possible valuations. One algorithmic method for verifying that every valuation causes this sentence to be true is to make a [[truth table]] that includes every possible valuation.

For example, consider the formula
:&lt;math&gt; ((A \land B) \to C) \Leftrightarrow (A \to (B \to C)).&lt;/math&gt;
There are 8 possible valuations for the propositional variables ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', represented by the first three columns of the following table. The remaining columns show the truth of subformulas of the formula above, culminating in a column showing the truth value of the original formula under each valuation.

!&lt;math&gt;A \to (B \to C)&lt;/math&gt;

Because each row of the final column shows ''T'', the sentence in question is verified to be a tautology.

It is also possible to define a [[deductive system]] (proof system) for propositional logic, as a simpler variant of the deductive systems employed for first-order logic (see Kleene 1967, Sec 1.9 for one such system). A proof of a tautology in an appropriate deduction system may be much shorter than a complete truth table (a formula with ''n'' propositional variables requires a truth table with 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; lines, which quickly becomes infeasible as ''n'' increases). Proof systems are also required for the study of intuitionistic propositional logic, in which the method of truth tables cannot be employed because the law of the excluded middle is not assumed.

==Tautological implication==
{{Main|Tautological consequence}}

A formula ''R'' is said to '''tautologically imply''' a formula ''S'' if every  valuation that causes ''R'' to be true also causes ''S'' to be true. This situation is denoted &lt;math&gt;R \models S&lt;/math&gt;.   It is equivalent to the formula &lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt; being a tautology (Kleene 1967 p.&amp;nbsp;27).

For example, let ''S'' be &lt;math&gt;A \land (B \lor \lnot B)&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''S'' is not a tautology, because any valuation that makes ''A'' false will make ''S'' false.  But any valuation that makes ''A'' true will make ''S'' true, because &lt;math&gt;B \lor \lnot B&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology. Let ''R'' be the formula &lt;math&gt;A \land C&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;R \models S&lt;/math&gt;, because any valuation satisfying ''R'' makes ''A'' true and thus makes ''S'' true.

It follows from the definition that if a formula ''R'' is a contradiction then ''R'' tautologically implies every formula, because there is no truth valuation that causes ''R'' to be true and so the definition of tautological implication is trivially satisfied. Similarly, if ''S'' is a tautology then ''S'' is tautologically implied by every formula.

==Substitution==
{{Main|Substitution instance}}

There is a general procedure, the '''substitution rule''', that allows additional tautologies to be
constructed from a given tautology (Kleene 1967 sec. 3). Suppose that ''S'' is a tautology and for
each propositional variable ''A'' in ''S'' a fixed sentence ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; is chosen. Then the
sentence obtained by replacing each variable ''A'' in ''S'' with the corresponding sentence ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; is also a tautology.

For example, let ''S'' be the tautology 
:&lt;math&gt;(A \land B) \lor \lnot A \lor \lnot B&lt;/math&gt;.
Let ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; be &lt;math&gt;C \lor D&lt;/math&gt; and let ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; be &lt;math&gt;C \to E&lt;/math&gt;.
It follows from the substitution rule that the sentence
:&lt;math&gt;((C \lor D) \land (C \to E)) \lor \lnot (C \lor D) \lor \lnot (C \to E)&lt;/math&gt;
is a tautology, too.  In turn, a tautology may be substituted for the truth value "[[Logical truth|true]]".

==Semantic completeness and soundness ==
An [[axiomatic system]] is [[Completeness (logic) | complete ]] if every tautology is a theorem (derivable from axioms). An axiomatic system is [[soundness|sound]] if every theorem is a tautology.

== Efficient verification and the Boolean satisfiability problem ==
The problem of constructing practical algorithms to determine whether sentences with large numbers of propositional variables are tautologies is an area of contemporary research in the area of [[automated theorem proving]].

The method of [[truth tables]] illustrated above is provably correct – the truth table for a tautology will end in a column with only ''T'', while the truth table for a sentence that is not a tautology will contain a row whose final column is ''F'', and the valuation corresponding to that row is a valuation that does not satisfy the sentence being tested. This method for verifying tautologies is an [[effective procedure]], which means that given unlimited computational resources it can always be used to mechanistically determine whether a sentence is a tautology. This means, in particular, the set of tautologies over a fixed finite or countable alphabet is a [[decidable set]].

As an [[efficient procedure]], however, truth tables are constrained by the fact that the number of valuations that must be checked increases as 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''k'' is the number of variables in the formula.  This exponential growth in the computation length renders the truth table method useless for formulas with thousands of propositional variables, as contemporary computing hardware cannot execute the algorithm in a feasible time period.

The problem of determining whether there is any valuation that makes a formula true is the '''[[Boolean satisfiability problem]]'''; the problem of checking tautologies is equivalent to this problem, because verifying that a sentence ''S'' is a tautology is equivalent to verifying that there is no valuation satisfying &lt;math&gt;\lnot S&lt;/math&gt;. It is known that the Boolean satisfiability problem is [[NP complete]], and widely believed that there is no [[polynomial-time algorithm]] that can perform it. Consequently tautology is [[co-NP-complete]]. Current research focuses on finding algorithms that perform well on special classes of formulas, or terminate quickly on average even though some inputs may cause them to take much longer.

==Tautologies versus validities in first-order logic==
The fundamental definition of a tautology is in the context of propositional logic. The definition can be extended, however, to sentences in [[first-order logic]] (see Enderton (2002, p.&amp;nbsp;114) and Kleene (1967 secs. 17–18)). These sentences may contain quantifiers, unlike sentences of propositional logic.   In the context of first-order logic, a distinction is maintained between '''logical validities''', sentences that are true in every model, and '''tautologies''', which are a proper subset of the first-order logical validities. In the context of propositional logic, these two terms coincide.

A tautology in first-order logic is a sentence that can be obtained by taking a tautology of propositional logic and uniformly replacing each propositional variable by a first-order formula (one formula per propositional variable).  For example,
because &lt;math&gt;A \lor \lnot A&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology of propositional logic, &lt;math&gt; (\forall x ( x = x)) \lor (\lnot \forall x (x = x))&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology in first order logic. Similarly, in a first-order language with a unary relation symbols ''R'',''S'',''T'', the following sentence is a tautology:
:&lt;math&gt;(((\exists x Rx) \land \lnot (\exists x Sx)) \to \forall x Tx) \Leftrightarrow ((\exists x Rx) \to ((\lnot \exists x Sx) \to \forall x Tx)).&lt;/math&gt;
It is obtained by replacing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\exists x Rx&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lnot \exists x Sx&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\forall x Tx&lt;/math&gt; in the propositional tautology &lt;math&gt;((A \land B) \to C) \Leftrightarrow (A \to (B \to C))&lt;/math&gt;.

Not all logical validities are tautologies in first-order logic. For example, the sentence
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x Rx) \to \lnot \exists x \lnot Rx&lt;/math&gt;
is true in any first-order interpretation, but it corresponds to the propositional sentence &lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt; which is not a tautology of propositional logic.

==In natural language==

In natural languages, some apparent tautologies may have non-tautological meanings in practice. In English, "it is what it is" is used to mean 'there is no way of changing it'.&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;Nathan J. Robinson, "The Uses of Platitudes", ''Current Affairs'', August 23, 2017 [https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/08/the-uses-of-platitudes online]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], ''vantaalum varuvaan'' literally means 'if he comes, he will come', but really means 'he just may come'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Penelope |last=Brown |first2=Stephen C. |last2=Levinson |title=Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage |series=Studies in Interactional Sociolinguistics |volume=4 |origyear=1978 |year=1987 |isbn=0-521-30862-3 |page=166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book reviews===

[[Nicholas Kristof]] reviewed the book for ''[[The New York Times]]'', beginning with a discussion of the [[earning to give]] strategy. Kristof had three reservations about the book: (1) it's not clear where to draw the line with respect to altruism, (2) in addition to humanitarian motives, loyalty is also important and many give to universities or the arts out of loyalty, (3) the idea of taking a job solely because it is well-paying made him flinch. Kristof concluded on a positive note: "Singer’s argument is powerful, provocative and, I think, basically right. The world would be a better place if we were as tough-minded in how we donate money as in how we make it."&lt;ref name=kristof&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-the-trader-who-donates-half-his-pay.html|title = The Trader Who Donates Half His Pay|last = Kristof|first = Nicholas|authorlink = Nicholas Kristof|date = April 4, 2015|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/416476/nicholas-kristof-shouldnt-follow-peter-singer-wesley-j-smith|title = Nicholas Kristof Shouldn’t Follow Peter Singer|last = Smith|first = Wesley|date = April 5, 2015|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = ''The Corner'', ''[[National Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Chicago Law School]] professor [[Eric Posner]] reviewed the book for ''[[Slate Magazine]]'', concluding: "So what’s an effective altruist to do? The utilitarian imperative to search out and help the people with the highest marginal utility of money around the world is in conflict with our limited knowledge about foreign cultures, which makes it difficult for us to figure out what the worst-off people really need.* For this reason, donations to Little League and other local institutions you are familiar with may not be a bad idea. The most good you can do may turn out to be—not much."&lt;ref name=posner-slate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2015/03/effective_altruism_critique_few_charities_stand_up_to_rational_evaluation.single.html|title = Should Charity Be Logical?

Minal Bopaiah wrote a blog post favorably reviewing the book for PSI Impact, a website maintained by [[Population Services International]]. PSI was one of many charities discussed by Singer in his book as potentially effective places to donate to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psiimpact.com/2015/04/book-review-the-most-good-you-can-do-by-peter-singer/|title = Book Review: The Most Good You Can Do by Peter Singer |last = Bopaiah|first = Minal|date = April 8, 2015|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = PSI Impact}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Abdulla reviewed the book on [[Oxfam]]'s blog, concluding: "And so the question that remains for me, as I think more about the ideas laid out in this book, is how can I challenge myself to do more good in this world?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstperson.oxfamamerica.org/2015/04/want-to-do-the-most-good-you-can-do-in-the-world-follow-these-3-steps/|title = Want to do the most good you can do in the world?

Glenn C. Altschuler, professor of American Studies at [[Cornell University]], reviewed the book for [[Philadelphia Media Network|Philly.com]], concluding: "Singer opens up worthwhile conversations (and practical applications) related to ethical ideals. At minimum, The Most Good You Can Do can stimulate donors to insist that charitable organizations provide persuasive proof of their effectiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/20150419__Peter_Singer_s__Most_Good__makes_rational_case_for_good_life.html|title = 'Peter Singer's 'Most Good' makes rational case for good life|last = Altschuler|first = Glenn C.|date = April 19, 2015|accessdate = April 20, 2015|publisher = [[Philadelphia Media Network|Philly.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2003 – The U.S. enacted the ''[[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]]'' and [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] signed it into law.

It also mandated that unlicensed centers post notice of their unlicensed status. The centers, typically run by Christian non-profit groups, challenged the act on the basis that it violated their free speech.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3660">In [[fluid mechanics]], [[meteorology]] and [[oceanography]], a '''trajectory''' traces the motion of a single point, often called a [[fluid parcel|parcel]], in the flow.

Trajectories are useful for tracking atmospheric contaminants, such as smoke plumes, and as constituents to [[Lagrangian coordinates|Lagrangian]] simulations, such as [[contour advection]] or [[semi-Lagrangian scheme]]s.

Suppose we have a time-varying flow field, &lt;math&gt;\vec v(\vec x,~t)&lt;/math&gt;. The motion of a fluid parcel, or trajectory, is given by the following system of [[ordinary differential equations]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \vec x}{dt} = \vec v(\vec x, ~t)
&lt;/math&gt;

While the equation looks simple, there are at least three concerns when attempting to solve it [[numerically]].  The first is the [[numerical ordinary differential equations|integration scheme]]. This is typically a [[Runge-Kutta]],&lt;ref name="Press_etal1992"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although others can be useful as well, such as a [[leapfrog integration|leapfrog]].  The second is the method of determining the velocity vector, &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; at a given position, &lt;math&gt;\vec x&lt;/math&gt;, and time, ''t''. Normally, it is not known at all positions and times, therefore some method of [[interpolation]] is required.  If the velocities are gridded in space and time, then [[bilinear interpolation|bilinear]], [[trilinear interpolation|trilinear]] or higher-dimensional linear interpolation is appropriate. [[Bicubic interpolation|Bicubic]], [[Tricubic interpolation|tricubic]], etc., interpolation is used as well, but is probably not worth the extra [[overhead (computing)|computational overhead]].

Velocity fields can be determined by measurement, e.g. from [[weather balloons]], from numerical models or especially from a combination of the two, e.g. [[data assimilation|assimilation models]].

The final concern is metric corrections.  These are necessary for geophysical fluid flows on a spherical Earth.  The differential equations for tracing a two-dimensional, atmospheric trajectory in longitude-latitude coordinates are as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \theta}{dt} = \frac{u}{r \cos \phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \phi}{dt} = \frac{v}{r}
&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; are, respectively, the longitude and latitude in [[radian]]s, ''r'' is the [[radius of the Earth]], ''u'' is the zonal wind and ''v'' is the meridional wind.

One problem with this formulation is the polar singularity: notice how the denominator in the first equation goes to zero when the latitude is 90 degrees—plus or minus.  One means of overcoming this is to use a locally [[Cartesian coordinate]] system close to the poles.  Another is to perform the integration on a pair of [[Azimuthal equidistant projection]]s—one for the N. Hemisphere and one for the S. Hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Mills2012" &gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1202.1999

Trajectories can be validated by [[balloons]] in the [[atmosphere]] and [[buoys]] in the [[ocean]].

'''Type inference''' refers to the automatic detection of the [[data type]] of an expression in a [[programming language]].

It is a feature present in some [[strongly-typed programming language|strongly]] [[Type system#Static typing|statically typed]] languages. It is often characteristic of [[functional programming language]]s in general. Some languages that include type inference include [[C++11]], [[C Sharp 3.0#Local variable type inference|C#]] (starting with version 3.0), [[Chapel (programming language)|Chapel]], [[Clean (programming language)|Clean]], [[Crystal (programming language)|Crystal]], [[D (programming language)|D]], [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], [[FreeBASIC]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (starting with version 10), [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]], [[ML (programming language)|ML]], [[Nim (programming language)|Nim]], [[OCaml]], [[Opa (programming language)|Opa]], [[RPython]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], [[Vala (programming language)|Vala]] and [[Visual Basic .NET#2008 (VB 9.0)|Visual Basic]] (starting with version 9.0). 
The majority of them use a simple form of type inference, while especially those ones who use the [[Hindley–Milner_type_system|Hindley-Milner type system]] provide a more complete type inference. The ability to infer types automatically makes many programming tasks easier, leaving the programmer free to omit [[type signature|type annotations]] while still permitting type checking.

==Nontechnical explanation==
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2018}}
In some programming languages, all values have a [[data type]] explicitly declared at [[compile time]], limiting the values a particular expression can take on at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]]. Increasingly, [[just-in-time compilation]] renders the distinction between run time and compile time moot. However, historically, if the type of a value is known only at run-time, these languages are [[dynamically typed]]. In other languages, the type of an expression is known only at [[compile time]]; these languages are [[statically typed]]. In most statically typed languages, the input and output types of functions and [[local variable]]s ordinarily must be explicitly provided by type annotations. For example, in [[C (programming language)|C]]:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int addone(int x) {
    int result; /* declare integer result */

    result = x + 1;
    return result;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The [[Type signature|signature]] of this function definition, &lt;code&gt;int addone(int x)&lt;/code&gt;, declares that &lt;code&gt;addone&lt;/code&gt; is a function that takes one argument, an [[integer (computer science)|integer]], and returns an integer. &lt;code&gt;int result;&lt;/code&gt; declares that the local variable &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; is an integer. In a hypothetical language supporting type inference, the code might be written like this instead:
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt; addone(x) {
     var result;  /* inferred-type variable result */
     var result2; /* inferred-type variable result #2 */

     result = x + 1;
     result2 = x + 1.0;  /* this line won't work (in the proposed language) */
     return result;
 }&lt;/source&gt;
This is identical to how code is written in the language [[Dart (programming language)|Dart]], except that it is subject to some added constraints as described below.  It would be possible to ''infer'' the types of all the variables at compile time. In the example above, the compiler would infer that &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; have type integer since the constant &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; is type integer, and hence that &lt;code&gt;addone&lt;/code&gt; is a function &lt;code&gt;int -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;. The variable &lt;code&gt;result2&lt;/code&gt; isn't used in a legal manner, so it wouldn't have a type.

In the imaginary language in which the last example is written, the compiler would assume that, in the absence of information to the contrary, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; takes two integers and returns one integer. (This is how it works in, for example, [[OCaml]].) From this, the type inferencer can infer that the type of &lt;code&gt;x + 1&lt;/code&gt; is an integer, which means &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; is an integer and thus the return value of &lt;code&gt;addone&lt;/code&gt; is an integer. Similarly, since &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; requires both of its arguments be of the same type&lt;!--integers--&gt;, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; must be an integer, and thus, &lt;code&gt;addone&lt;/code&gt; accepts one integer as an argument.

However, in the subsequent line, ''result2'' is calculated by adding a decimal &lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt; with floating-point arithmetic, causing a conflict in the use of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; for both integer and floating-point expressions. The correct type-inference algorithm for such a situation has been known [[#Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm|since 1958]] and has been known to be correct since 1982. It revisits the prior inferences and uses the most general type from the outset: in this case floating-point. This can however have detrimental implications, for instance using a floating-point from the outset can introduce precision issues that would have not been there with an integer type.

Frequently, however, degenerate type-inference algorithms are used that cannot backtrack and instead generate an error message in such a situation. This behavior may be preferable as type inference may not always be neutral algorithmically, as illustrated by the prior floating-point precision issue.

An algorithm of intermediate generality implicitly declares ''result2'' as a floating-point variable, and the addition implicitly converts &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to a floating point. This can be correct if the calling contexts never supply a floating point argument. Such a situation shows the difference between ''type inference'', which does not involve [[type conversion]], and [[implicit type conversion]], which forces data to a different data type, often without restrictions.

Finally, a significant downside of complex type-inference algorithm is that the resulting type inference resolution is not going to be obvious to humans (notably because of the backtracking), which can be detrimental as code is primarily intended to be comprehensible to humans.

The recent emergence of [[just-in-time compilation]] allows for hybrid approaches where the type of arguments supplied by the various calling context is known at compile time, and can generate a large number of compiled versions of the same function. Each compiled version can then be optimized for a different set of types. For instance, JIT compilation allows there to be at least two compiled versions of ''addone'':

:A version that accepts an integer input and uses implicit type conversion.
:A version that accepts a floating-point number as input and uses floating point instructions throughout.

==Technical description==
Type inference is the ability to automatically deduce, either partially or fully, the type of an expression at compile time. The compiler is often able to infer the type of a variable or the [[type signature]] of a function, without explicit type annotations having been given. In many cases, it is possible to omit type annotations from a program completely if the type inference system is robust enough, or the program or language is simple enough.

To obtain the information required to infer the type of an expression, the compiler either gathers this information as an aggregate and subsequent reduction of the type annotations given for its subexpressions, or through an implicit understanding of the type of various atomic values (e.g. true : Bool; 42 : Integer; 3.14159 : Real; etc.). It is through recognition of the eventual reduction of expressions to implicitly typed atomic values that the compiler for a type inferring language is able to compile a program completely without type annotations.

In complex forms of [[higher-order programming]] and [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], it is not always possible for the compiler to infer as much, and type annotations are occasionally necessary for disambiguation. For instance, type inference with [[polymorphic recursion]] is known to be undecidable. Furthermore, explicit type annotations can be used to optimize code by forcing the compiler to use a more specific (faster/smaller) type than it had inferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bryan O'Sullivan |author2=Don Stewart |author3=John Goerzen |year=2008 |title=Real World Haskell |chapter=Chapter 25. Profiling and optimization |publisher=O'Reilly |url=http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/profiling-and-optimization.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relative to [[program analysis]], type inference is a special case of [[points-to analysis]] that uses a type abstraction on pointer targets.

==Example==
As an example, the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] function &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; applies a function to each element of a list, and may be defined as:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 map f [] = []
 map f (first:rest) = f first : map f rest
&lt;/source&gt;

Type inference on the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function proceeds as follows. &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; is a function of two arguments, so its type is constrained to be of the form &lt;code&gt;a → b → c&lt;/code&gt;. In Haskell, the patterns &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(first:rest)&lt;/code&gt; always match lists, so the second argument must be a list type: &lt;code&gt;b = [d]&lt;/code&gt; for some type &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;. Its first argument &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is [[function application|applied]] to the argument &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt;, which must have type &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;, corresponding with the type in the list argument, so &lt;code&gt;f :: d → e&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; means "is of type") for some type &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;. The return value of &lt;code&gt;map f&lt;/code&gt;, finally, is a list of whatever &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; produces, so &lt;code&gt;[e]&lt;/code&gt;.

Putting the parts together leads to &lt;code&gt;map :: (d → e) → [d] → [e]&lt;/code&gt;. Nothing is special about the type variables, so it can be relabeled as
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 map :: (a → b) → [a] → [b]
&lt;/source&gt;

It turns out that this is also the most general type, since no further constraints apply. As the inferred type of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; is [[parametric polymorphism|parametrically polymorphic]], the type of the arguments and results of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; are not inferred, but left as type variables, and so &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; can be applied to functions and lists of various types, as long as the actual types match in each invocation.

The origin of this algorithm is the type inference algorithm for the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] that was devised by [[Haskell Curry]] and [[Robert Feys]] in 1958.
In 1969 [[J. Roger Hindley]] extended this work and proved that their algorithm always inferred the most general type.

==Side-effects of using the most general type==
By design, type inference, especially correct (backtracking) type inference will introduce use of the most general type appropriate, however this can have implications as more general types may not always be algorithmically neutral, the typical cases being:
* floating-point being considered as a general type of integer, while floating-point will introduce precision issues
* variant/dynamic types being considered as a general type of other types, which will introduce casting rules and comparison that could be different, for instance such types use the '+' operator for both numeric additions and string concatenations, but what operation is performed is determined dynamically rather than statically

==Type inference for natural languages==

The currently valid version is the Update 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/i3794en/I3794en.pdf|title=World Reference Base for Soil Resources 2014, Update 2015|last=IUSS Working Group WRB|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the third edition 2014. It is edited by a working group of the [[International Union of Soil Sciences]] (IUSS).

== History ==
Since the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, several countries developed national [[soil classification]] systems. During the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the need for an international soil classification system became more and more obvious. 

From 1971 to 1981, the Food and Agriculture Organization ([[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]) and [[UNESCO|UNESCO]] published the [[Soil Map of the World]], 10 volumes, scale 1 : 5 M. The Legend for this map, published in 1974 under the leadership of Rudi Dudal, became the [[FAO soil classification]]. Many ideas from national soil classification systems were brought together in this worldwide-applicable system, among them the idea of diagnostic horizons as established in the ‘7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; approximation to the [[USDA soil taxonomy]]’ from 1960. The next step was the Revised Legend of the Soil Map of the World, published in 1988.

In 1982, the International Soil Science Society (ISSS; now: [[International Union of Soil Sciences]], IUSS) established a working group named International Reference Base for Soil Classification (IRB)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iuss.boku.ac.at/files/iuss126_def_72dpi.pdf|title=IUSS Bulletion 126, page 38-45|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Chair of this working group was Ernst Schlichting. Its mandate was to develop an international soil classification system that should better consider soil-forming processes than the FAO soil classification. Drafts were presented in 1982 and 1990.

In 1992, the IRB working group decided to develop a new system named World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) that should further develop the Revised Legend of the [[FAO soil classification]] and include some ideas of the more systematic IRB approach. Otto Spaargaren ([[International Soil Reference and Information Centre]]) and Freddy Nachtergaele ([[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]) were nominated to prepare a draft. This draft was presented at the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[World Congress of Soil Science]] in Acapulco in 1994. At the same congress, the WRB was established as an ISSS working group replacing the IRB. At the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; World Congress of Soil Science in Montpellier in 1998, the first edition of the WRB was published. At the same congress, the ISSS endorsed the WRB as its correlation system for soil classification. (In 2014, the [[USDA soil taxonomy]] also received the status of a correlation system.) At the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; World Congress of Soil Science in Philadelphia in 2006, the second edition of the WRB was presented, and at the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; World Congress of Soil Science in Jeju in 2014, the third edition. An update of the third edition was issued in 2015. Whereas the second edition was only suitable for naming soils, the third edition can additionally be used for creating map legends.

The WRB has only two hierarchical levels (see below) and has in that sense a similar approach as the French référencial pédologique (1992, 1995, 2008). Contrary to that, the [[USDA soil taxonomy]] is strongly hierarchical and has six levels. The classification in WRB is based mainly on soil morphology (field and laboratory data) as an expression of [[pedogenesis]]. Another difference with USDA soil taxonomy is that soil climate is regarded only as a soil-forming factor and not as a soil characteristic. The WRB is not meant to replace national soil classification systems, which, for their area, may be more detailed than the WRB.

== The WRB 2015 ==

=== The architecture of the WRB ===
The classification is based on '''diagnostic horizons''', '''diagnostic properties''' and '''diagnostic materials''', altogether called '''diagnostics'''. Diagnostic materials are materials that significantly influence soil-forming processes ([[pedogenesis]]). They are either inherited from the parent material or the result of soil-forming processes. Diagnostic properties are typical results of soil-forming processes or reflect specific conditions of soil formation. Diagnostic horizons are typical results of soil-forming processes that show a minimum thickness and therefore a horizontal appearance. 

The diagnostics have names (e. g. argic horizon, stagnic properties, fluvic material), The WRB does not use horizons symbols (A horizons, B horizons). Therefore, horizons that are not diagnostic, do not have names. Instead, WRB recommends using the horizon symbols provided by the FAO Guidelines for Soil Description (2006). 

The classification comprises two levels: 

The first level has 32 '''Reference Soil Groups''' (RSGs).

At the second level, for further differentiation a set of '''qualifiers''' is added to the name of the RSG. There are 185 qualifiers in total. For every RSG, there is a list of available qualifiers, which are subdivided into two types: 

* '''Principal qualifiers''' describe typical characteristics of a RSG. They are ranked and given in an order of importance. They are placed before the name of the RSG.
* '''Supplementary qualifiers''' describe additional characteristics. They are not ranked and used in alphabetical order. They are placed after the name of the RSG in brackets and separated from each other by commas.

The names of the RSGs and the qualifiers start with capital letters. They must be given in English and must not be translated into any other language in order to guarantee that a certain soil has the same name all over the world. 

=== Naming a soil with the WRB ===
A key is used for allocating a soil to a certain RSG. In a defined sequence, the key asks for the presence or absence of certain diagnostics in a certain depth range. In addition, the key asks for single characteristics, e. g., a certain clay content or a certain base saturation. The soil belongs to the first RSG, for which it fulfils the set of criteria.

The qualifiers available for use with a particular RSG are listed in the key, along with the RSG. Their number is from 35 to 68. All applying qualifiers must be added to the soil name. The principal qualifiers are added before the name of the RSG. The sequence is from right to left, i.e. the uppermost qualifier in the list is placed closest to the name of the RSG. The supplementary qualifiers are added in brackets after the name of the RSG and are separated from each other by commas. The sequence is from left to right, i.e. the first qualifier according to the alphabet is placed closest to the name of the RSG. If no other principal qualifier applies, the Haplic qualifier is used. If two or more qualifiers in the list are separated by a slash (/) only one of them can be used. The slash signifies that these qualifiers are either mutually exclusive (e.g. Dystric and Eutric) or one of them is redundant with the redundant qualifier(s) listed after the slash(es). In the soil name, supplementary qualifiers are always placed in the order of the alphabet, even if their position in the list differs from alphabetical sequence due to the use of the slash. It is a general rule that qualifiers conveying redundant information are not used. Example: If a soil has the Calcaric qualifier (carbonates present) the Eutric qualifier (high base saturation) is not used.

Qualifiers may be combined with specifiers (e.g. Epi-, Proto-) to form subqualifiers (e.g. Epiarenic, Protocalcic). The depth-related specifiers are of special importance, although their use is optional:

* Epi-: only from 0 to ≤50 cm,
* Endo-: only below &gt;50 cm,
* Amphi-: only from &gt;0 to &lt;100 cm,
* Ano-: only from 0 to &gt;50 and &lt;100 cm,
* Kato-: only from &gt;0 to ≥100 cm
* Panto-: from 0 to ≥100 cm

=== Creating map legends with the WRB ===
The number of qualifiers used in a map legend depends on the scale. The WRB distinguishes four map scale levels: 

* first map scale level: RSG only,
* second map scale level: the RSG plus the first applying principal qualifier,
* third map scale level: the RSG plus the first two applying principal qualifiers,
* fourth map scale level: the RSG plus the first three applying principal qualifiers.

Correlating the map scale levels with concrete scales (e.g. fourth map scale level from 1 : 250 000 to 1 : 1 000 000) is difficult because selecting a map scale level depends very much from the homogeneity/heterogeneity of the landscape.

The principal qualifiers are added before the name of the RSG following the rules explained for naming a soil. Depending on the purpose of the map or according to national traditions, at any scale level, further qualifiers may be added optionally. They may be additional principal qualifiers from further down the list and not already used in the soil name, or they may be supplementary qualifiers. They are placed using the above-mentioned rules for supplementary qualifiers; principal qualifiers first, then supplementary qualifiers.

The WRB recommends that on a map unit not just one soil is indicated but an association of soils. For this purpose, WRB uses the following nomenclature: 

* dominant: the soil represents &gt;50 % of the soil cover,
* codominant: the soil represents 25 - 50 % of the soil cover,
* associated: the soil represents 5 - 25 % of the soil cover. 

For codominant and associated soils, it is allowed to use less principal qualifiers than would correspondent to the used map scale level. The use of specifiers is not recommended due to the generalization that is required when making maps. In map legends, the names of the RSGs are given in plural; in all other cases they are given in singular. 

=== The WRB Manual ===
The WRB Manual comprises five chapters and four annexes. 

Chapter 1 reports on background and basics. It includes tables of the diagnostic horizons and of the RSGs. The latter is given below. Chapter 2 provides the rules for classifying soils and creating map legends. It is highly recommended to read this short chapter before using the WRB. Chapter 3 presents the diagnostic horizons, properties and materials, each with a general description, the diagnostic criteria and some additional information. For the decision, whether a diagnostic is present or absent in a soil, only the diagnostic criteria are relevant. Chapter 4 provides the key to the RSGs and for every RSG a list with the available principal and supplementary qualifiers. Chapter 5 gives the definitions of the qualifiers. These five chapters are concluded with a list of references. 

They are followed by four annexes. Annex 1 briefly describes the 32 RSGs. Annex 2 lists the laboratory methods. This is only a list; it is not a laboratory manual. Annex 3 gives the codes for the RSGs, the qualifiers and the specifiers and the rules for the sequence of the codes for naming soils and creating map legends. Annex 4 provides a texture triangle, in which the ranges of the texture-related qualifiers are marked with different grey shades.

== Examples ==

=== Example for naming a soil with the WRB ===
Our example soil has the following characteristics: 

Field characteristics: A soil developed from [[loess]] shows a marked clay increase in around 60 cm depth and clay coatings in the clay-richer horizon. According to the landscape setting, we presume that high-activity clays dominate. In the field, a pH value of 6 is measured in the subsoil. The lower part of the clay-poorer topsoil is bleached. In the clay-richer horizon, we observe a mottling; the oximorphic and the reductimorphic colours sum up to 30% of the exposed area, the intensive colours in the interiors of the aggregates. In spring time, reducing conditions occur. The soil is ploughed regularly. Organic matter concentrations in the topsoil are small.

Laboratory characteristics: The laboratory analyses confirm the high [[Cation-exchange capacity|cation exchange capacity]] per kg clay in the clay-richer horizon and the high base saturation in the subsoil. In the topsoil, we find 20% [[clay]], 10% [[sand]] and 70% [[silt]], in the subsoil 35% clay, 10% sand and 55% silt. 

The naming of the soil consists of four steps. 

'''Question 1: Does the soil have diagnostic horizons, properties and materials?''' 

The soil has the following diagnostics: 

* albic material (in the bleached horizon)
* argic horizon (clay-richer horizon)
* stagnic properties (in the clay-richer horizon)
* reducing conditions (in the clay-richer horizon)

'''Question 2: To which RSG does the soil belong?''' 

We have to go through the key RSG for RSG. This soil is not a Histosol, not an Anthrosol, not a Technosol etc. Finally, we end up with the [[Luvisols]]. This is the first RSG in the key, the criteria of which our soil completely fulfils. 

'''Question 3: Which qualifiers apply?''' 

From the list of the principal qualifiers, Stagnic (stagnic properties und reducing conditions) and Albic (light colours) apply. Stagnic is found further up in the list. Therefore, the soil has to be named up till now Albic Stagnic Luvisol. From the list of the supplementary qualifiers, Siltic (silty from 0 to 60 cm), Loamic (loamy from 60 cm downwards), Aric (ploughed), Cutanic (clay coatings) und Ochric (small concentrations of organic carbon) apply. Bringing the supplementary qualifiers into the alphabetical order, the soil is an Albic Stagnic Luvisol (Aric, Cutanic, Loamic, Ochric, Siltic). 

'''Question 4: Which specifiers can be used to form subqualifiers?''' 

The soil is Siltic from 0 to 60 cm and Loamic from 60 cm downwards. We can use the depth-related specifiers Ano- and Endo- to construct the subqualifiers Anosiltic and Endoloamic. The stagnic properties occur only in the subsoil and the albic material only around 50 cm. This means that we can use the subqualifiers Endostagnic and Amphialbic. 

Now, the soil name is: Amphialbic Endostagnic Luvisol (Aric, Cutanic, Endoloamic, Ochric, Anosiltic). 

Using the codes of Annex 3 of the WRB Manual gives us the following short name: LV-stn.abm-ai.ct.lon.oh.sia. 

=== Example for creating map legends with the WRB ===
Let’s say that our example soil Amphialbic Endostagnic [[Luvisol]] (Aric, Cutanic, Endoloamic, Ochric, Anosiltic) covers 60% of the area of a map unit. The other 40% are covered by a Eutric Endoluvic Amphialbic [[Stagnosol]] (Humic, Endoloamic, Anosiltic). The map unit will be named as follows: 

First map scale level: 

* dominant: Luvisols
* codominant: Stagnosols

Second map scale level: 

* dominant: Stagnic Luvisols
* codominant: Albic Stagnosols

Third map scale level: 

* dominant: Albic Stagnic Luvisols
* codominant: Luvic Albic Stagnosols

Fourth map scale level: 

* dominant: Albic Stagnic Luvisols
* codominant: Eutric Luvic Albic Stagnosols

Remarks: The use of the depth-related specifiers is not recommended in map legends, where generalization is required. The fourth scale level would allow three principal qualifiers, but the dominant soil in our example has only two. 

At every scale level, optional qualifiers may be added. If one wants to give information about organic carbon, one can do that even at the first map scale level and write: 

* dominant: Luvisols (Ochric)
* codominant: Stagnosols (Humic)

If somebody wants to give additional information on soil genesis, this can also be done on the first map scale level: 

* dominant: Luvisols (Stagnic)
* codominant: Stagnosols (Luvic)

Both in combination would read, e. g., at the second map scale level: 

* dominant: Stagnic Luvisols (Ochric)
* codominant: Albic Stagnosols (Luvic, Humic)
