'''Ada Jane Jones''' (June 1, 1873 &amp;ndash; May 2, 1922) was an English-American popular singer who made her first recordings in 1893 on Edison cylinders. She is among the earliest female singers to be recorded.&lt;ref name="Songwriters"&gt;{{cite web|title=Songwriters Hall of Fame - Artists - Ada Jones|url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/artists/C4031|website=Songwriters Hall of Fame|accessdate=12 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714081517/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/artists/C4031|archive-date=2016-07-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
She was born in [[Lancashire]], UK, but moved with her family to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], at the age of six in 1879. She started performing on stage, including juvenile roles in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=sutton&gt;{{cite web|last=Sutton|first=Allan|title=A Prehistory of Ada Jones: 1889–1905|url=http://www.mainspringpress.com/jones_history.html|publisher=Mainspring Press|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She sang in a [[contralto]], learning songs by ear, and lacked the ability to read music or play an instrument. Her repertoire included [[ballads]], [[ragtime]], [[vaudeville]], and comedy in a variety of dialects. During 1893–1894, she recorded for [[Edison Records]] on [[wax cylinders]], making her among the earliest female singers to be recorded.&lt;ref name="Songwriters" /&gt; She sang with [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], Billy Watkins, [[Cal Stewart]], [[Len Spencer]], the [[American Quartet (ensemble)|American Quartet]], and with her 12-year-old daughter Sheilah. Touring was made difficult due to [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="AM Bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ada Jones {{!}} Biography &amp; History|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ada-jones-mn0000496080|website=AllMusic|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 or 1894 she recorded some musical performances for the [[North American Phonograph Company]], including "Sweet Marie" and "[[The Volunteer Organist]]". But the demise of this company interrupted her recording career and it was not until 1905 that she returned to recording, after a few years doing performances at such locations as Huber's 14th Street Museum in New York City.&lt;ref name=sutton /&gt;

Ada Jones recorded "[[The Yama Yama Man]]" in 1909 for the [[Victor Light Opera Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/AdaJonesVictorLightOperaCompany-TheYamaYamaMan1909 Ada Jones &amp; Victor Light Opera Company - The Yama Yama Man 1909], [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics for verse two and three were changed from the original, verse two being more bawdy. It was the most popular song of her career, spending five weeks at number one.&lt;ref name=netlex&gt;[http://www.netlexfrance.info/2006/07/05/the-yama-yama-man/ "The Yama Yama Man"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426071513/http://www.netlexfrance.info/2006/07/05/the-yama-yama-man/ |date=April 26, 2012 }}, Netlex News, July 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones died in [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina]], on May 22, 1922&lt;ref name="AM Bio" /&gt; of kidney failure.

'''Airlock Alpha''', formerly '''SyFy Portal''', is an entertainment news [[website]] focusing on [[science-fiction]], [[fantasy]] and [[comic book]] television series and films.

==History==
After a collaboration between Michael Hinman and Greg Boubel,&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airlockalpha.com/site/frequently-asked-questions.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Airlock Alpha |first=|last=|date= |accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the site debuted August 13, 1998, as "Syfyman's World", later renamed "SyFy World". In 2000, SyFy World became part of Trek Nation, the parent network of TrekToday. In 2001, the site merged with the Star Trek Portal website and relaunched as "SyFy Portal".

On February 23, 2009, the site announced a rebranding under the new name of Airlock Alpha. No reason outside of a new marketing strategy was given for the name change at the time, but on March 16, 2009, [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] announced that it was changing its name to Syfy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/business/media/16adcol.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1237165200-yH6NwYCOt3vBQQSizTAc6A |title=Sci Fi Channel Has A New Name; Now, It's Syfy |publisher=New York Times |date=2009-03-15 |accessdate=2009-03-15 | first=Stuart | last=Elliott| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090417100127/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/business/media/16adcol.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1237165200-yH6NwYCOt3vBQQSizTAc6A| archivedate= 17 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Airlock Alpha revealed that it had sold its former brand name to an undisclosed party a month earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airlockalpha.com/news426164.html |title=SciFi Channel Changes Name ...

Airlock Alpha created the Genre Awards in 1999, which has handed out awards for genre television and movies nearly every year since.&lt;ref name=portal10years&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airlockalpha.com/node/6647 |title=10 Years Of Portal Awards Winners |publisher=Airlock Alpha |first=Michael |last=Hinman |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based upon fan-based voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipsemagazine.com/Movies/12266/ |title=TELEVISION &amp; MOVIES: 2009 Portal Awards Filled With Surprises! |work=Eclipse Magazine |first=Sheldon A.|last=Wiebe |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were later renamed as the Portal Awards.&lt;ref name=portal10years/&gt;

Originally she turned into a car, however, later incarnations have turned into motorcycles. The character has gained much notability upon appearing in ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'', even though that incarnation is significantly altered than the others. 
Arcee's design, alternate mode, and personality vary depending on continuity. Usually colored pink and white, she has also been depicted as a blue-colored character, and [[Botcon]] storyline saw her reformatted into a [[Maximal (Transformers)|Maximal]] spider.

Arcee is a female Autobot warrior and the daughter of [[Fortress Maximus]] who turns into a pink convertible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Ultimate Guide | last=Furman | first=Simon | year=2004 | publisher=DK Publishing Inc.| ISBN=1-4053-0461-8 | page= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artistic license: the animated couples you never knew you always wanted. Curve; June 1, 2009; by Shatto, Rachel&lt;/ref&gt; She was voiced by [[Susan Blu]].

=== Animated series ===
Although a group of [[Female Autobots]] had already been featured in one episode of [[The Transformers (TV series)|the original cartoon series]], Arcee quickly became the best-known due to her position as a recurring cast member following her introduction in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''.
Arcee who would go on to be involved in several more ''Transformers''-related shows as voice director, even reprising her role as Arcee in [[Transformers: Animated]]. Arcee was a gunner and was depicted as being an excellent marksman. Arcee was not one of the Female Autobots in the aforementioned group. In the season 3 introduction, "Five Faces of Darkness", she accompanies Springer on a mission to track down a sleezoid ship. The mission eventually reunites them with [[Grimlock]] and [[Rodimus Prime]]. They also go onto rescue [[Ultra Magnus]], [[List of Autobots|Kup]] and [[Witwicky family#Spike Witwicky|Spike Witwicky]] from the clutches of the [[Quintessons]].

Arcee would appear sporadically over the course of the season, and even kept her main character status into the fourth season dubbed "The Rebirth". She was a major player in "Dark Awakening", being among the crew zombie [[Optimus Prime]] betrayed aboard the mausoleum. And, in "Dweller in the Depths", she is seen fighting back against Springer when he is turned into an energy vampire.

[[Image:autobotsynthoids.jpg|left|thumb|Ultra Magnus, Springer, Rodimus Prime, and Arcee as humans]]
In the episode "Only Human", Ultra Magnus, [[Springer (Transformers)|Springer]], [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]] and Arcee found their minds transferred into human-mimicking "[[synthoid]]" bodies by the human crime lord [[Victor Drath]].

In the final three episodes of the U.S. television series, when the Decepticons successfully stole the key to the [[Plasma Energy Chamber]] and opened the ancient device, a group of Autobots and humans included Arcee and [[Daniel Witwicky]] were blasted across the galaxy by the energy release, crash-landing on the planet Nebulos. Quickly siding with a group of rebels engaged in a war against the planet's evil rulers, [[Hive (Transformers)|the Hive]], they deduced a process by which they could combine the best of their minds and bodies together, becoming Headmasters. While the other Autobot Headmasters combined with Nebulons, Daniel became Arcee's Headmaster partner.

In the Japanese television series ''Transformers: The Headmasters'', the events of the last three episodes of the U.S. series were ignored. Although Headmasters were introduced, they had a vastly different origin. Arcee did not become a Headmaster, but was a regular on this series, appearing in most of the episodes, from episode 1 "Four Warriors Come Out of The Sky" to episode 35 "The Final Showdown On Earth Part 2".

In the ''[[Beast Wars]]'' episode "Transmutate", [[Rattrap (Transformers)|Rattrap]] referred to Arcee as his great aunt: "''What in the name of my great aunt Arcee is going on!?''" The character [[Transmutate]] was coincidentally voiced by Susan Blu, who also voiced Arcee.

=== Books ===
Arcee appeared in the 1986 story and coloring book ''[[List of Transformers books#The Lost Treasure of Cybertron|The Lost Treasure of Cybertron]]'' by Marvel Books.

===Comics===

==== 3H Enterprises ====
''Transformers: Universe Wreckers'' #1 starts with a flashback to late in the original cartoon series, where Daniel Witwicky and Wheelie are killed. This puts Daniel's friend Arcee into a sad state. The main story is set in the later episodes of ''[[Beast Machines]]''. Arcee, now a [[Maximal (Transformers)|Maximal]] Valkyrie with a spider beast mode, joins the [[Wreckers (Transformers)|Wreckers]], though initially she proves unwilling. The [[Predacon]] [[Fractyl]] speaks with her after the rest of the group leaves, but is then almost killed by the [[Vehicons]], and Arcee saves his life by sharing her [[Spark (Transformers)|Spark]] with him, converting him into a new body in the process. The two then rejoin the rest of the team and flee Cybertron in an Autobot shuttle, which unbeknownst to them has been boarded by [[Devcon]]. A confrontation with him leaves Fractyl dangerously wounded, and Arcee takes him to receive medical care. She and the other Wreckers are then betrayed by [[Cyclonus]], who had infiltrated the team in service to the Predacon criminal [[Cryotek]].

According to the script for the unreleased issue #4 of ''Transformers: Universe - The Wreckers'' the Wreckers returned to Cybertron where they helped repel an invasion by the [[Quintessons]].

==== Devil's Due Publishing ====
[[File:Gijoe-transformers.jpg|right|thumb|Transformers Perceptor, [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Grimlock]], and Arcee meet Hawk of G.I. Joe.]]
Arcee appeared in the Devil's Due third series of ''[[G.I. Joe]] vs. The Transformers''. [[Grimlock]], Arcee, Bumblebee, and Perceptor were sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of Cybertronian technology on Earth. When [[Cobra Command|Cobra]] attacked the base, the Autobots helped repel the Cobra Battle Android Trooper armies. However, [[Cobra Commander]] was able to infiltrate the base and awaken the special project the government was working on - [[Serpentor|SerpentO.R]], a cyborg created using DNA from many great warleaders and parts from [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]]. SerpentO.R. promptly turned on him and escaped to Cybertron via Spacebridge. The Autobots and a team of G.I. Joes led by [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|Hawk]] pursued him. During this an attraction had been growing between Arcee and Bumblebee. This led to Bumblebee's death at the hands of SerpentO.R and Arcee and the others were captured. Freed by [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]], Arcee was part of the assault to rescue Prime and proved instrumental in SerpentO.R's (now controlled by Cobra Commander) defeat, ripping his chestpiece off and allowing Hawk to reach the Matrix, opening it and putting Cobra Commander in a coma. Arcee was seen mourning Bumblebee at the end.

==== Dreamwave Productions ====
During the years when Shockwave united most of Cybertron, Arcee was in a resistance group to his rule along with [[List of Autobots|Kup]], [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]], [[Hot Rod (Transformers)|Hot Rod]] and [[Wheelie (Transformers)|Wheelie]]. Later, after Shockwave's defeat, Arcee joined Ultra Magnus in trying to fortify one of Cybertron's moons – but her affections were the subject of a feud between Hot Rod and [[Springer (Transformers)|Springer]].

==== IDW Publishing ====
It is revealed in [[IDW Publishing]]'s ''[[The Transformers: Spotlight|Spotlight]]'' issue that Arcee was a part of [[Jhiaxus]]'s experiments to introduce gender into the Cybertronian species. Arcee was his first test-subject and her creation was due to Jhiaxus altering with her CNA. According to Arcee she did not measure up to Jhiaxus's ideals and was abandoned.

Unlike her other versions, this Arcee, while still an Autobot by allegiance, is a violent, antisocial killer who is imprisoned by the other Autobots at Garrus 9 for her actions. Released by a reluctant Fortress Maximus during a Decepticon attack to buy time for Jetfire's team to get rid of the [[Monster Pretenders|Monstructor components]], her power level appears much higher than a normal Autobot, as she is seen taking on all of the [[Combaticons]] single handed and winning, although unable to stop their kidnapping of the Monstructor components due to a teleporter based escape plan. She is classified as a "level 9" threat, the only Autobot of that power level present in the prison during the assault. Realizing there is a link between her and the Monstructor Transformers, as they were all created by Jhiaxus, Maximus and Jetfire release her to track them down.

Throughout the ''Revelations'' arc, Arcee hunts for Jhiaxus to get her revenge, finally confronting him in ''Spotlight: Sideswipe''. She is informed by [[Hardhead]] that Jhiaxus cannot be destroyed forever as he is bound to the Dead Universe; she is pleased by this, as it means she has the chance to kill him, over and over, forever.

In ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', it is revealed that she and Hardhead had remained on Garrus Prime to guard the portal to the Dead Universe and continue torturing Jhiaxus. When the D-Void called the entire population of the planet into the portal to feed on, Arcee was overwhelmed, but Hardhead, vaccinated against the call by his exposure to dead universe energy during revelations, held her back until the portal closed. Since then, they had been exploring the remains of a mysterious dead civilization uncovered by the portal closing. When Galvatron and the seekers arrived to investigate, Arcee and Hardhead engaged them and despite initial success including the severe wounding of Galvatron, became outmatched when Galvatron used the Heart of Darkness to heal himself and attack them, and Hardhead told her to run and get help. Cyclonus blasted a bridge out from under her, and left her for dead, but she was later seen pulling herself back out of the pit.

Later on, Arcee joins with Prowl, becoming his personal assassin whom he deploys to murder [[Ratbat]] in order to keep peace on a post-war Cybertron. Prowl dispatches her to kill several more Decepticons, however some of these deaths are faked as a part of a conspiracy to rile up the many Decepticons on Cybertron into a frenzy against the provisional Autobot government. It is later revealed that Prowl has been under mind control by the Insecticon Bombshell since shortly after having Ratbat killed. Prowl is subsequently forced to become a part of a new Devastator under Bombshell's control. During this, Arcee appears to be loyal to the Decepticons, but once Devastator is unleashed on Cybertron, she kills Bombshell to sever his link with Prowl, enabling the newly formed Autobot combiner Superion to temporally overpower him.

Following the Decepticons defeat, Starscream takes command of the neutral population of Cybertron, and banishes Autobot and Decepticon alike from the small city built in the aftermath of the war. Arcee leaves with Prowl and the Autobots, eventually joining them officially by carving their insignia into her shoulder.

==== Marvel Comics ====
''All stories exclusive to Marvel UK are in italics''

Arcee was absent from the U.S. [[Marvel Comics]] (barring the adaptation of the movie), because the comics had established that in their continuity, Transformers did not possess sexes, thus Arcee's presence as a clearly female robot would have defied this.

Arcee also makes an appearance twice in the American ''Transformers: Headmasters #1'' as a background character in Fortress Maximus' regiment. In order to explain any Autobots introduced during the fourth (then-ongoing) and fifth production years, most of Fortress Maximus's crew on Cybertron and aboard the [[Steelhaven]] were unseen, or used generic bodies until readers were "surprised" with them later.

Arcee would appear in the UK Marvel comic issue #234, "Prime's Rib!" This story is set in the near future, 1995, where [[Optimus Prime]], [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] and [[Rodimus|Hot Rod]] introduce the latest Autobot, Arcee, to the human [[feminists]]. She was met with displeasure by the humans, being called a token female and disliked for her pink color. They were then attacked by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]], [[Fangry]], [[Horri-Bull]] and [[Squeezeplay (Transformers)|Squeezeplay]], who thought the Autobot would be unveiling a new weapon. The Autobots fought off the Decepticons, who escaped, but nothing seemed to please the human feminists.

The UK comic also set a number of stories directly after the events of the movie. The ''Space Pirates'' arc saw Arcee skip guard duty at [[Autobot City]]; her dereliction of duty led directly the fall of Autobot City to the [[Quintessons]]. She was then used as bait in a Quintesson trap to claim the [[Creation Matrix]] from [[Rodimus Prime]]. Arcee achieved some measure of redemption by aiding Rodimus Prime, now reduced in power to his ''Hot Rod'' form, in his bid to reclaim Autobot City by activating [[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]].

Arcee later joined Rodimus Prime's time-travelling party, helping in the fight against [[Galvatron]] during the ''Time Wars''. Arcee and the other future Autobots returned find to their own time-stream changed to a different, darker future, where Galvatron was alive and ruling most of Cybertron.

Arcee appeared among the Autobots under the command of Rodimus Prime in the alternate future story "Aspects of Evil 2" from Marvel UK Transformers #224. In this story Rodimus Prime remembered how Galvatron, Crankcase, Ruckus and Windsweeper killed Blurr and then attacked Rodimus Prime, Kup, Arcee and the Battle Patrol. Enraged, Rodimus nearly killed Galvatron, but to keep the Matrix from being contaminated by hatred he relented.

Arcee appeared in Marvel UK Transformers #251 "The Void!" where she was among the Autobot crew of a ship commanded by Rodimus Prime which was retreating from Cybertron.

=== Toys ===
* '''''Generation 1'' Headmaster Arcee''' (unreleased)
:Like all the new characters in the movie (with the exception of Ultra Magnus), Arcee was designed for animation first, but while the other new characters inspired toys that saw final release, Arcee's design never passed early prototype stages for unknown reasons. When she became a [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmaster]], Takara dallied with the idea of repainting the [[Chromedome (Transformers)|Chromedome]] toy to represent her, but the suggestion was abandoned. A few pictures of prototypes have appeared online. In robot mode, Daniel would have been able to turn into Arcee's head, in vehicle mode he would have formed the front of the car.
* '''''Heroes of Cybertron'' Arcee''' (2001)
: A non-transforming "Heroes of Cybertron" G1 Arcee was released in 2001. It was later repainted as "Paradron Medic".
* '''''Beast Machines'' BotCon Arcee''' (2001)
: In 2001, Arcee finally received a toy in the form of an exclusive for the 2001 [[BotCon]] convention. The toy itself was a recolored version of the previous year's Transmetals 2 [[Blackarachnia]] toy, and some packaging featured a new sound clip recorded by Susan Blu.
* '''''Binaltech'' BT-21 Arcee Featuring Honda S2000 Hardtop''' (2008)
: A redeco of Alternators [[Decepticharge]] in Honda's Pearl White color, with Arcee's traditional pink accents in robot mode. She retains Decepticharge's head sculpt and removable hardtop accessory; however, as a Japanese Binaltech release, she has the full length gun barrel seen with [[Overdrive (Transformers)|Overdrive]], instead of Decepticharge's truncated one. This figure never saw a U.S. release, as Hasbro canceled the ''Alternators'' line years prior.
* '''''Generations Thrilling 30''/Legends LG-10 Arcee''' (2014/2015)
: Arcee finally received a toy faithful to her animation model as part of the ''Generations'' Thrilling 30 toyline in 2014. A new-mold toy, it comes with a pair of translucent blue swords paying homage to her ''Animated'' and IDW counterparts, as well as a pair of guns; all four can be stored on her in vehicle mode. The toy was released in Japan by [[Takara Tomy]] as part of the ''Legends'' toyline, albeit redecoed to better resemble her cartoon counterpart.

The first reuse of the name Arcee was in Japan. In 2003, the name Arcee was given to the Mini-Con known in America as [[Sureshock]] (leading to some debate on the Mini-Con's gender - the Dreamwave Comics would later identify Sureshock as female, but the tech specs for ''Transformers: Cybertron'' Sureshock would refer to it as male). Sureshock was even repainted in pink and white colors in Japan as ''X-Dimension Arcee''.

In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', Arcee had a wide-release original mold made in homage to the original character. In the ''Energon'' storyline, the character Arcee was a female Omnicon who transformed into a motorcycle and used an energon crossbow. She was created to be a leader for the Omnicons and, as such, was the only Omnicon to have a unique name and body-type. In Japan the toy and character were named '''Ariel''', a name used by the female transformer who was the "girlfriend" of [[Orion Pax]] in the original series's episode "War Dawn"; this Ariel would later become [[Elita One]].

In the original Japanese series ''Superlink'', it is said Ariel took the form of a woman as a symbol of care, who protects all soldiers.

===Animated series===
This incarnation of Arcee was a member of the Omnicons, a race and faction of [[robots]] exclusive to this fictional universe of [[Transformers (fiction)|Transformers]]. Larger than [[Mini-Con]]s, they can carry passengers and process raw [[energon]] to create tools, weapons, or energon stars. Omnicons were a main group of characters ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'' series allied with the [[Autobots]]. They were opposition of to the Decepticon allied [[Terrorcon]]s.

While Omnicons were formerly [[Autobot]]s and [[Decepticon]]s, these two sides set aside their differences and left [[Cybertron]] with [[Rodimus|Team Rodimus]]. The Omnicons eventually began working together to mine Energon, the energy-rich mineral needed to power Transformers and their technology. Invaluable to the Transformers because of their unique ability to handle, shape and process raw energon, which is damaging to normal Transformers, the Omnicons created the Cybertron cities as only they can. There are three distinct body types shared among the Omnicon ranks, but unlike the Terrorcons, each Omnicon possesses an individual mind of his own.

Additionally, there is one other Omnicon body-type - that of the unique Omnicon leader, Arcee. Transforming into a motorcycle and wielding an Energon crossbow, she arrived in the middle of [[Megatron]]'s attack on Cybertron, guiding the Omnicon forces into subduing [[Unicron]]'s hunger. She was soon frequently partnered with [[Kicker (Transformers)|Kicker]] on the battlefield.

All of the Omnicon toys, including Arcee, were redecoed and released as Target store exclusives for the 2007 Transformers movie. The new colors are designed to look more like a real vehicle would be painted, in keeping with the theme of the movie.

=== Dreamwave Productions ===
Arcee also appeared in the [[Dreamwave Productions]] ''Transformers: Energon'' comics, as one of the four Omnicons watched over by the [[Mini-Con]] [[Over-Run]].

Arcee would first appear in issue #19, being introduced to [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]] by Over-Run as the first of the new species—the Omnicons. Subsequently, assigned to Earth for training, they managed to annoy their commander [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]] beyond reason but subsequently apprehended [[Cyclonus|Snow Cat]]. Arcee would have further adventures battling [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]], Sharkticon and [[Slugslinger]] to protect [[Kicker (Transformers)|Kicker]], eventually defeating them with Kicker's help.

=== Fun Publications ===
Arcee appeared in the text story from [[Fun Publications]] called "Force of Habit". This story explained where she was during the events of the ''Cybertron'' story. Ultra Magnus was the commander of various Autobot ships sent to other planets in search for the Cyber Planet Keys. Arcee served as captain of the ''[[Azusa (Transformers)|Azusa]]'' which was sent to [[Gamma Serpentis]].

=== Toys ===
* '''''Energon'' Basic Arcee'''
:In 2005, ''Energon'' Arcee was repackaged for the ''[[Transformers: Universe]]'' toy line, although the character has not appeared in the ''Universe'' storyline. This toy was identical to the ''Energon'' release, but in ''Universe'' packaging.
:The Arcee/Ariel toy (Arcee's main color was [[Salmon (color)|salmon-pink]], while Ariel's was [[Rose (color)#Japanese Pink|Japanese pink]]) was later repainted [[green]] and [[Aqua (color)|aqua]] as the Aerial Paradron Type in Japan, in the colors of Generation 1 [[Paradron Medic]].

Arcee was initially set to be in the 2007 ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' film and had a very positive fan reaction, but due to the fact that there was not enough time in the movie to explain the presence of a "female" in a robotic race,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Todd Gilchrist | title = Exclusive interview: Roberto Orci | publisher = IGN | date=2007-07-02 | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/801/801098p3.html | accessdate=2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was dropped from the script and replaced with [[Ironhide#2007 Transformers film|Ironhide]].

Arcee was also initially set to battle [[Blackout (Transformers)#2007 Transformers movie|Blackout]] in the movie. According to the Hasbro 2007 movie toy's tech spec for Arcee, she received combat training from Ironhide.

According to the biography printed in the collected ''Reign of Starscream'' books, Arcee was once a member of the Autobot science team who had to adapt her skills when the war broke out.

According to the biography for the ''Revenge of the Fallen'' Chromia toy, she is a sister to [[Chromia (Transformers)|Chromia]] and [[Elita One]]. She is an unusual Cybertronian as she and her sisters (Chromia and Elita One) are controlled by one mind, allowing them to attack with extremely precise timing. According to the biography for her 2009 movie toy she commands her team. Writer Roberto Orci has stated he intended the three motorcycles to be a single mind, but Michael Bay portrayed them as individuals just like the Hasbro bios. According to Hasbro, Arcee is only about 7 feet tall but on the scale for the first film it was stated she was 9 feet tall.

=== IDW Publishing ===
In ''[[Transformers: Defiance]]'' #1, back on ancient Cybertron Arcee was among Optimus Prime's crew at an excavation site near the temple at Simfur where an artifact was uncovered. In issue #2 Arcee helped in the recovery effort after the attack on Cybertron. She later sided with Optimus Prime against Megatron's orders to counter-attack their invaders. In issue #4 Arcee, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Jazz and Smokescreen ambushed Ironhide, who they believed worked for Megatron, but Ironhide instead joined Optimus Prime's Autobots. Arcee and Bumblebee later spied on the building of the Decepticon starship Nemesis.

Although Arcee was not in the film, the character still appeared in the comic book ''[[Transformers: Movie Prequel]]'' where she fights as part of Bumblebee's squad. She realized that Bumblebee knew more than he was revealing, but likewise said nothing when their squad was captured and tortured by the Decepticons.

In ''[[Reign of Starscream]]'' the Decepticon [[Starscream]] barely made it to the Nemesis on Mars before he ran out of power. His return was noted by the Autobot [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]], who alerted Arcee, [[Cliffjumper]], [[Smokescreen (Transformers)|Smokescreen]], [[Camshaft (Transformers)|Camshaft]] and [[Air Raid (Transformers)|Air Raid]]. Aided by [[Thundercracker]] on the Nemesis Starscream recovered and sent the information Frenzy had gathered back to Cybertron just as Hardtop spotted the Autobots closing on the Nemesis. Arcee appears on the cover of issue #3. In issue #4 Arcee returned to Cybertron from [[Mars]] by hiding in the landing gear of Starscream's ship. Once on the planet she was discovered by a [[Dreadwing]] and [[Payload (Transformers)|Payload]] drone, who she deactivated. Returning to an Autobot training facility she discovered [[Clocker (Transformers)|Clocker]], who took her to [[Crosshairs (Transformers)|Crosshairs]] who was planning an attack to free the Autobots at [[Simfur]], which they attempted with the aid of [[Wingblade]], [[Skyblast]], [[Breakaway (Transformers)|Breakaway]] and [[Transformers|Strongarm]].

In ''Tales of the Fallen'' #6 Arcee is taken by [[Thundercracker]] and given to the Decepticon medic [[Flatline (Transformers)|Flatline]], who experiments on her. Upon waking up she discovers [[Skids (Transformers)|Skids]] and [[Mudflap (Transformers)|Mudflap]] are also captives of the Decepticons. After she discovers her spark has been merged with that of Chromia and Elita One, they have a mental link, and use this to lead an escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chrismowry.blogspot.com/2010/01/arcee-5-pages.html|title=THE FULL MOWRY|author=Chris Mowry|work=chrismowry.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arcee, Chromia and Elita One subsequently were among the Autobots to come to Earth in response to Optimus Prime's signal inviting all of his kind to come there. She joined with the Earth-based Autobots in ''[[Transformers: Alliance]]'' #4.

In ''Rising Storm'' #1, its revealed that Arcee, Chromia, and Elita-One survived the events in eygpt and with the Autobots when they set a trap for Starscream's minions Divebomb, [[Fearswoop]] and [[Skystalker]] by having [[Theodore Galloway]] pose as an arms dealer attempting to purchase Cybertronian technology. The trap is uncovered and the Autobots send in Arcee, Chromia, [[Elita-One]], Ironhide, Mudflap and Skids. Divebomb and Skystalker are killed while Fearswoop is captured by the Autobots and taken back to the NEST base on [[Diego Garcia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = John Barber| penciller = Carlos Magno| inker = Aburtov and Graphiksslava| story = | title = Transformers: Rising Storm| volume = 1| issue = 1| date = February 2011| publisher = IDW Publishing| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In issue #3, she, Chromia, and Elita one are sent to [[New York City]] hoping to get information from Starscream who was sending information to humans, but instead found Astrotrain and a monster, then they realized [[Shockwave]] is on Earth. They tried to contact Optimus and warn him, but Soundwave jammed their communications and were attack by his minions. Elita-One went to go warn Optimus. In issue #4, Elita-one is killed by Shockwave, Arcee and Chromia felt her death, they sent off the explosives which possibility killed Soundwave's minions, but Arcee and Chromia survived.

Note - The appearance of Arcee is modified in some of the IDW Publishing stories, she has a Cybertronian alternate mode.

=== Titan Magazines ===
Note: Information in ''italics'' occurs in the alternate storyline where Megatron won the battle for the Allspark.

''In "Twilight's Last Gleaming" part 1, Skyblast lead the Autobots Arcee, Armorhide, Elita One, Longarm, and Strongarm who in resisting the Decepticons who had conquered Earth. In part 3 Starscream and [[Scorponok]] attack the Autobots Arcee, [[List of Transformers: Cybertron characters#Toy-only characters|Armorhide]], Elita One, [[Longarm (Transformers)|Longarm]], [[Skyblast]], and [[Transformers|Strongarm]] on the moon. The Autobots flee to Earth, which is exactly what Starscream hoped they'd do. In part 4 Ratchet and Ironhide continued fighting Bonecrusher in Savannah, but did not stand much of a chance until they were joined by Arcee, Armoride, and Longarm, arriving from the moon. In this story Arcee resembles a pink version of her scout class toy in robot mode, but assumes a Cybertronian "protoform entry mode" for her vehicle mode.'' ''Arcee appeared in issue #17 of the Titan Transformers Magazine, in a story called "Return to Cybertron Part 1". In this story she is among the Autobots that go to Cybertron.'' ''Arcee would return in issue #22 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called "The Decepticon who Haunted Himself."''

=== Target Robo-Vision ===
According to her extended biography from the Target store exclusive [[Robo-Vision]] web site, Arcee was only on Earth for a short time before her stealth skills were needed elsewhere. Optimus Prime sent her to another planet to stop Decepticon research on a star breaking weapon.

=== Movie plot ===
In ''Revenge of the Fallen'' Arcee was accompanied by two similar Transformers, Chromia and Elita One, sharing similar robot and vehicle forms, as well as the same holographic driver. They chased the Decepticon [[Sideways (Transformers)|Sideways]] in an alley in [[Shanghai]], but lost track of him. They were later present when the Autobots faced off with the Decepticons in Egypt, and were sent with [[Ironhide]] as an advance team to recover Sam. Upon finding Sam and Mikaela, several Decepticons attacked, and Arcee and Elita One were shot, and killed  while Chromia was last seen taking cover.

In ''Age of Extinction'' a card with her picture on it was seen with a Red 'X' through it confirming her death

Arcee is a female Autobot who seems to be inspired by her ''Generation 1'' counterpart and [[Susan Blu]] reprises the role. She was originally a teacher before the war began, her full name being Teaching Unit RC-687040.

=== Animated series ===
Arcee makes an appearance in the "''[[Transformers Animated]]''" episode "Thrill of the Hunt". During several flashback sequences, [[Ratchet (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Ratchet]] recalls his first encounter with the rogue bounty hunter [[Lockdown (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Lockdown]] during the Great War thousands of years earlier. Still a young field medic at that time, Ratchet comes across Arcee, who has been injured in the fighting. He knocks her out to repair her left leg, but then they are both ambushed by Lockdown. After being taken to his hideout, Lockdown divulges that Arcee is carrying vital information [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Megatron]] would be interested in, intent to extract it for his employer. After Lockdown forcibly removes Ratchet's medical-use [[electro-magnetic pulse]] generator from his left arm as a personal trophy, Arcee manages to sneak it back to Ratchet. She then bravely tells Ratchet to use the EMP device on her to erase her data core so that Lockdown will not be able to retrieve the data from her. After protesting that doing so would also completely erase her entire life and memory, Ratchet is suddenly forced to do so in order to protect them both from Lockdown. After escaping, Arcee's memory has, as expected, been completely erased, including all knowledge of herself.

It was revealed in "Transwarped" that due to a special fail-safe program after being placed in stasis, Arcee uploads the data into Ratchet, allowing him to continue her mission of activating [[Omega Supreme#Transformers Animated|Omega Supreme]].

Long after the Great War has ended, a now-older Ratchet honors her by keeping the painful memory of her intact in his own mind. However, by the events of "This is Why I Hate Machines", when Megatron arrives to Cybertron in Omega Supreme, the exposed [[Shockwave (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Shockwave]] begins setting up a scheme to track down Arcee and acquire the access code to Omega Supreme from her. His plans are delayed when Ratchet and Captain Fanzone arrive on Cybertron and made an attempt protect to Arcee before Shockwave escapes with her. However, it turned out her memory may not be as lost as previously believed. Though at first only her pre-war memories were available, Shockwave manages to recover her war-time ones before forcefully extracting the activation codes when she refused to give them willingly. This action resulted with Arcee relapsing until Sari's new-found ability allows Ratchet to use his EMP generator to restore Arcee's memories before she uses her codes to regain control of Omega Supreme. In the aftermath of the final battle on Earth, Arcee returns home to Cyberton with the Autobots, Omega Supreme, and the captured Megatron.

Arcee is one of the main group of [[Autobots]] in the 2010 computer animated series ''[[Transformers: Prime]]''. She transforms into a blue motorcycle, inspired by her appearance in the live film series, but with a more humanoid robot form. As a motorcycle she is capable of producing a humanoid female hologram driver who she refers to as "Sadie" to help disguise her identity. She can form bladed weapons or blasters from her hands. Arcee is the most focused character in the series, and arguably the show's main [[protagonist]] for much of the first and second seasons. Arcee played a smaller role in the third season, but had an episode that focused on her, "Plus One", where she started a potential relationship with Wheeljack, convincing him to stay with the Autobots. She is the only character to have actual flashbacks and complete in-depth origin episodes, where as characters such an Optimus Prime and Smokescreen have images of an event while they narrate the story. Arcee is also the only character to have two "arch-enemies" [[Starscream]] and [[Airachnid]], creating a three-way rivalry, holding a grudge against the two for killing her former partners Cliffjumper and Tailgate respectively. She is also the only character who appeared in every single episode of the series until "Triangulation" (in which she was only mentioned) in the middle of the second season. After that she was absent from only three more episodes: "Triage", "Chain of Command", and "Thirst" (a Decepticon focused episode that featured no Autobots). Coincidently, Arcee's human partner Jack, is arguably the most focused human of the series, having had his own background focused on more in-depth unlike most other human characters.

Arcee, as the [[Angry Birds]] Stella transformed, is an unlockable character in [[Angry Birds Transformers]].

===IDW Publishing===
Before the war, Arcee had been spying in [[Kaon]], and sometime during it she had been rescued by [[Cliffjumper]]. When Optimus ordered the Autobots to [[Earth]], her ship had been destroyed, and she was willing to wait as she detected the Decepticons had returned to Cybertron and they were planning something ''big''. There, she entered a base and annihilated the [[Vehicon]]s there, inadvertently returning Cliffjumper's favor. She hacked into the Decepticons's communications signal there, and found their weapons lab in Kaon. Arcee found Cliffjumper a brash soldier inappropriate for her stealthy mission, but he convinced her Kaon was too dangerous and that she could use his ship to go to Earth.

The duo entered the city through the maintenance tunnels Arcee had once explored, and she found a secret staircase by activating an Autobot symbol on the wall. There they discovered [[Starscream]] had rebuilt a [[Orbiting skyhooks|space bridge]] to travel to Earth. Concerned by the repercussions of the Decepticons's discovery of how to build space bridges, Arcee wanted to destroy it, but Cliffjumper convinced her it was their way off Cybertron. Distracting Starscream with a ruse, Arcee activated the space bridge and overloaded its systems, jumping through it with him before it blew up.

Landing on Earth, the duo scanned their alternate modes and traveled to find a population center where they could build a scanner and find Optimus. Starscream attacked, having also jumped through the space bridge, blasting Arcee's arm off. Cliffjumper fought him and tried to get Arcee to safety, but she refused, telling him to leave her and find Optimus. Optimus and [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] appeared, fending off Starscream and [[Breakdown (Transformers)|Breakdown]]. Optimus carried Arcee through a [[Transport to Oblivion|GroundBridge]] to base, where [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] reattached her arm.

Following Optimus's sacrifice, Arcee, Bumblebee and Bulkhead encountered [[Sludge (Transformers)|Sludge]] in a tunnel. They emerged on the surface in time to help [[Grimlock]] and the other Dinobots fight a squad of [[Forged]]. Arcee was shocked to hear they'd been created by Shockwave. After dealing with that threat, Arcee starting filling the Dinobots in on recent events, only for them to be promptly attacked by a new Predacon. The Autobots split into groups to head to Kaon, with Arcee and Swoop taking one group of survivors. [[Swoop (Transformers)|Swoop]] drew off the Predacon when it attacked, allowing Arcee and the other to reach Kaon while the Predacon was dealt with. There, Arcee explained that the Dinobots would always be welcome in the Autobot ranks. Grimlock, however, said the Dinobots would be unable to help with the reconstruction of Kaon, since they'd be building a new home for the survivors.

===Titan Magazines===
Arcee took part in the testing of Ratchet's newly developed Safe training room, though she was amused by the medic's interest in making things explode. After Bulkhead broke through a wall, Arcee alerted the others to the rather large nuclear missile he'd accidentally uncovered and activated. A Vehicon scouting party showed up looking for the source of the energy signature the bomb was giving off, so Optimus, Arcee and Bumblebee went out to trash them. The trio returned to base a short time later to find Fowler had arrived to deal with the bomb. Optimus took the other Autobots, including Arcee, on a trip to Valley of Fire State Park.

Arcee roundly mocked Bulkhead as he attempted to decorate a [[Christmas]] tree. Unfortunately for her, after Fowler reported that the Decepticons had taken over a [[Yamal (icebreaker)|nuclear-powered ship]], she found herself left at base with Bulkhead. The kids suggested she and Bulkhead try to find something they both liked, but progress was slow until they discovered their mutual love of ice skating. They subsequently turned the base into an ice rink and skated around it until the other Autobots came back.

She and Jack scouted out Franklin High School when schools in the region began unexpectedly exploding. It paid off when [[MECH]] turned up, however while Arcee was on the comm to Optimus, Jack sneaked inside the school. Arcee crashed inside to rescue him from MECH, though he insisted on following the baddies up to the roof. Silas got away anyway, and Arcee had to get Jack off the burning building. After the [[President of the United States]] was kidnapped, the Autobots traced the culprit, Starscream, to the [[Grand Canyon]]. Bumblebee and Arcee teamed up to take out the cannons manned by Vehicons that Starscream had brought along.

Arcee and Bulkhead headed to [[Zhejiang Province]], [[China]] after the Autobots lost contact with Optimus Prime. They found [[Knock Out (Transformers)|Knock Out]] and a bunch of Vehicons feeding Optimus's body into a crusher but were overcome by the Decepticons before they could rescue him. Luckily Optimus came to his senses in time. After Miko was kidnapped by MECH agent Novo, Arcee joined the hunt to find her.

Arcee was bemused by Jack's demonstration of bobbing for apples. She was on the team which visited the Deep Driller oil platform and encountered General Madison] and his men. After ending up underneath Bulkhead, she managed to trick two of the soldiers in robotic battle suits into shooting each other. When Bulkhead went missing, Arcee searched in vain until Miko managed to work out he was on the Decepticon ship. Arcee was subsequently part of the mission to rescue their friend. Arcee took part in a battle against the Decepticons in The Wave.

Following a TV studio takeover by Knock Out and [[Breakdown (Transformers)|Breakdown]], Arcee came along on the mission as backup. She took to the shadows, and once Optimus had rescued the other hostages, Arcee rescued [[Chuck Chuckles]] and took down the two Decepticons herself.

====Mega-Mouth====
Arcee occasionally takes time out from defending the universe and protecting the planet Earth in disguise to answer fan mail. In every issue, Arcee gets her own segment (sometimes with [[Megatron]]) to comment on the readers' fan mail and/or fan-art they sent them.

===''Tales of the Beast Hunters''===
Arcee tracked [[Ripclaw (Transformers)|Ripclaw]] to the [[Canadian Rockies]]. Rather than attack directly, she leaked the coordinates to the Decepticons in the hope they would deal with the problem.

===Animated series===
Arcee was a regularly appearing character in the ''Transformers: Prime'' animated series. Arcee was a participant in the [[Great War (Transformers)|Great War]] and originally was partnered with [[Tailgate (Transformers)|Tailgate]]. During one mission, she talked to Tailgate on comm before being captured by [[Airachnid]] for interrogation. Arcee was tied up and refused to talk. To try to make her talk, Airachnid captured Tailgate and threatened to kill him. When she still didn't talk, Airachnid slaughtered him before her very eyes. After Tailgate was killed, Arcee was saved by [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] and [[Cliffjumper]]. She began working alone and distancing herself from others to cope with her grief.

Arcee was captured by [[Starscream]] and taken captive alongside fellow [[Autobot]] Cliffjumper. She claimed to have never met him before and when Starscream said he would kill Cliffjumper if she did not cooperate, Arcee showed little to no concern about him. Starscream took the two Autobots to [[Shockwave]], who was on [[Cybertron]]. Shockwave used a [[cortical psychic patch]] to get the Intel, but the two managed to escape before he could kill them. They raced into a Space Bridge and teamed up with [[Optimus Prime]]. Cliffjumper and Arcee became partners at this time.

====''Darkness Rising'' mini-series====
In "Darkness Rising: Part 1", three years later, the [[Decepticons]] returned, killing Cliffjumper. Arcee was devastated at his loss. To cope, she went for a drive. She ended up having to protect a young human boy named Jack Darby from two [[Vehicons]]. Arcee was quickly joined by Bumblebee in the fight and they had a difficult time defeating them, until [[Bulkhead (Transformers)|Bulkhead]] arrived. After returning to the base, Arcee was ordered by Optimus to pickup Jack from his school. After talking to him briefly, the two were seen by a girl named Miko Nakadai. She took the two back to the base.

In "Darkness Rising: Part 2", Arcee went with Optimus, Bumblebee and Bulkhead to investigate the possibility of Cliffjumper still being alive. She and the other Autobots uncovered a Decepticon [[Energon]] mine and were shot at by the antagonistic robots. Arcee went ahead to find Cliffjumper, but discovered only his body, revived into a mindless zombie and mutilated. Realizing that he was lost, she and the other Autobots left.

In "Darkness Rising: Part 3", Arcee went out on patrol, after Optimus told her she was in charge of the base while he was with [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]], because she didn't want to babysit the kids. She took Bumblebee with her, leaving Bulkhead in charge of the kids. Arcee and Bumblebee drove around, before being contacted by Bulkhead. She was forced to go to Bulkhead's location after she found out the Decepticons had captured Agent Fowler (and that Miko had sneaked along with Bulkhead).

In "Darkness Rising: Part 4", Arcee got on the [[Nemesis (Transformers)|Nemesis]], along with Bumblebee. The two aided Bulkhead in defeating several Vehicons and promised to come back for the humans before the three went off to confront Starscream and rescue Fowler. Arcee pointed a gun pointblank at Starscream's head, as the Decepticon had Bumblebee and Bulkhead next to him, armed as well. But the Decepticon still managed to escape. Arcee rescued Fowler with the others, came back for the humans and escaped the Nemesis. Arcee watched as Jack refused to participate anymore in the endangerment of his life and others and left the Autobot base.

In "Darkness Rising: Part 5", despite her demeanor with him, Arcee could not stand to see Jack go and parked at his job, waiting for him. She explained to him that she couldn't leave him so soon after Cliffjumper's death. Arcee went out into space with Bumblebee, Bulkhead and Optimus to fight off [[Megatron]] in space. Before he was presumed dead, Arcee was shot by Megatron and taken back to the base. She survived the blast, much to the suspense of Jack and the other Autobots.

====Season 1====
In "Masters and Students", Arcee helped Jack with his science project, until Ratchet decided to get involved. In "Scrapheap", Arcee went with Optimus Prime to the Arctic to investigate. After determining there was nothing, she and Optimus tried to contact Ratchet back at the base, but could not. She started to rest, before Optimus warned her not to. Arcee tried to blame Bulkhead and reminded Optimus of the time Bulkhead first arrived on Earth, but Optimus reminded her that Bulkhead, even though he was clumsy, was a great help to the team. Just as  the two were about to freeze to death, [[Scraplets]] were launched from the base. Before the Scraplets could get to Arcee and Optimus, they froze and the two were allowed to get back into the base.

In "Con Job", she, Bulkhead and Bumblebee aided [[Wheeljack]] in defeating Decepticons try to stop him from reaching the other Autobots. She introduced herself to him and watched as he met Optimus. After it was revealed that the real Wheeljack was captured by Starscream and the one who arrived at the base was really [[Makeshift (Transformers)|Makeshift]], she tried to attack him with the others before Wheeljack arrived at the base and attacked him.

In "Convoy", Arcee went with Optimus, Bumblebee and Bulkhead to transport D.N.G.S. While transporting the military based object, the four were attacked by several MECH soldiers. she and the others were attacked by several Vehicons. The resulting fight inadvertently revealed their existence to MECH.

In "Deus Ex Machina", after Bulkhead accidentally destroyed a painting of an artifact, Arcee asked at the base how the Decepticons could search for an artifact when they had no idea where it was before being told by Raf that they could simply use the internet. Arcee fought alongside the rest of the Autobots against newly arrived Decepticons [[Breakdown (Transformers)|Breakdown]] and [[Knock Out (Transformers)|Knock Out]]. She and Bumblebee planned to attack the two at the same time, before they were forced to crash into each other by Knock Out. She, Bumblebee and Optimus Prime came to Bulkhead's aid after he single-handedly defeated the two and Starscream later on.

In "Speed Metal", as Arcee and Jack were leaving school, they encountered Sierra, who asked if she could take Jack up on his offer of a ride. They were interrupted by Vince, who challenged Jack to a race. Arcee reminded her companion of the rules, however when Vince made disparaging remarks about her motorcycle mode, she decided that he needed to be taught a lesson. Arcee and Jack completely smoked Vince at racing, though she made Jack swear not to tell any of the other Autobots. When Jack agreed to another race, Arcee flatly refused to take part, and later found out he'd talked Bumblebee into helping him instead. Furious, she dragged Bulkhead out to help her find Jack and Bumblebee, only to reach them just as Knock Out was abducting Vince. The three Autobots tracked the Decepticons to a storage facility, where Arcee attempted unsuccessfully to retrieve Vince from Knock Out, and ended up chasing the Con. She was unable to catch him, but Optimus turned up to lend a hand and rescue the human, and he demanded an explanation from his ashamed soldiers. Afterwards, Arcee was willing to allow Jack to give Sierra a ride, but just once.

In "Predatory", Arcee and Jack went on recon together. Arcee then saw a ship and realized that the ship was that of Airachnid. When she was confronted by Airachnid, Arcee tried to fight, but was tied up by Airachnid's webs. She tried to convince Jack to leave her behind. Arcee eventually managed to break free using her motorcycle mode, and caught up with Jack in time to save him by delivering a brutal beating to Airachnid, who managed to flee underground. Arcee was left with a new respect for how Jack had handled the situation, and was happy to call him her partner.

In "Sick Mind", after Optimus was infected by [[Cybonic plague (Transformers)|Cybonic plague]], Arcee and Bumblebee GroundBridged aboard the Nemesis to find a cure. They found Megatron's body in stasis lock. Arcee and Bumblebee used a cortical psychic to search Megatron's brain for the cure.  Arcee did the attaching, while Bumblebee went into Megatron's mind. Starscream discovered their hiding place, but luckily, just as he did, Bumblebee found the formula, so Arcee disconnected him and they both GroundBridged out of there.

In "Out Of His Head", Arcee, Bulkhead, and Optimus went after a telescope lens that Starscream had stolen to melt a glacier and gain the energon underneath. Arcee and Bulkhead drove towards the Nemesis to distract the Decepticons from Optimus. The two fought Breakdown and the fight ended in a stalemate.

In "Shadowzone", Arcee and the other Autobots discovered a [[Dark Energon]] signal. Arcee acted as GroundBridge operator. She realized that the kids had gone with the others and called Optimus to tell him so. Optimus told her to reopen the [[GroundBridge]], but the kids didn't make it through because Starscream's and the kids' GroundBridges crossed streams. Arcee Bridged the others back to base. She tried to call Jack, but was unable to. 
 
In "Operation: Breakdown", Arcee and the others hear from Bulkhead on his mission, during which he was knocked unconscious and never discovered where Breakdown, his combatant, disappeared to. When they heard that MECH had captured him, Optimus told them they were going to rescue Breakdown. Arcee was confused and asked why, to which Optimus replied that they could not let [[Cybertronian]] technology fall into MECH's hands. She came on the rescue mission with the others.

In "Crisscross", Arcee was present when Jack's mom, June, grounded him from his motorcycle. She and Bumblebee were raiding an Energon mine when Jack called her to tell her that his mom was coming home early. She bridged back into the garage, but not quite in time. When June asked Jack for an explanation, to Arcee's dismay, he told her the truth. He asked her to show herself to June, but she didn't, not wanting to blow her cover. When she bridged over the next night, she beat June home, only to find a package addressed to Jack. When Jack came home, he opened it to find a message from Silas: They had captured June and told them to come to their coordinates as soon as possible. They arrived at an oil refinery, where MECH was stationed. They discovered Airachnid had teamed up with MECH to get even with them. Arcee was webbed up and shocked unconscious. When she awakened, she was lying on an operating table and MECH was about to open her up. She knocked their tools away and drove out. She found Jack, Airachnid, and June. Airachnid was about to kill June, but Arcee knocked her out of the way. The two fought each other for some time, until Arcee landed a hard punch and knocked her down, then covering her with cement. Despite this, Airachnid broke through it easily and webbed Arcee to the ground. But before she could do anything else, Agent Fowler arrived. Airachnid escaped, but not before she scanned Fowler's helicopter. Jack introduced June to Arcee, and the next day she drove both of them to base.

In "Metal Attraction", Arcee and Jack were about to go on a routine diagnostic, but June intervened, asking whether it was safe. Arcee grew increasingly irritated by June's questions and doubts, and when Bulkhead was sent to check out a magnetic disturbance, she volunteered to go along. The two found Airachnid and Breakdown fighting over a [[polarity gauntlet]], a device that acts like a magnet. The two Autobots leapt into combat. After a few minutes' fighting, Bulkhead and Arcee overcame their opponents, but Breakdown grabbed the weapon and activated it. Warning him that it isn't a toy, Airachnid retreated underground, and Arcee and Bulkhead found themselves being dragged towards each other. The weapon hoisted them into the air before slamming them back against some rocks. The gauntlet magnetized Arcee to Bulkhead's back. Ratchet says their best bet to get Arcee unstuck is to get the gauntlet back. Bulkhead trudged up to the gas station to confront Airachnid, who had captured Breakdown and had the gauntlet. She told him to put his hands up and turn around. He did so, and Arcee promptly opened fire, managing to shoot the gauntlet out of Airachnid's hand. The device activated and dragged everything metal towards it. Breakdown was the first to touch it and shut the gauntlet down. Bulkhead and Arcee began awkwardly fighting Breakdown and Airachnid. Bulkhead managed to knock down Breakdown and turned to face Arachnid, but Breakdown used the gauntlet to drop an oil derrick on the Autobots. Pinned under an unconscious Bulkhead, Arcee was menaced by Airachnid. Fortunately, Bulkhead came around in time, and the pair stood up, now separated. Arcee attacked Breakdown, but Bulkhead found himself no match for Airachnid. She dragged Arcee to her, but Arcee got the upper hand and briefly used the gauntlet to polarize everyone. In the end, the Autobots triumphed and returned to base with the gauntlet, where Arcee received an apology from June for the earlier questioning.

In "Rock Bottom", Arcee was assigned to check out an old Energon mine with Bulkhead. When Miko ran into the mine, Arcee was persuaded by Jack to let him take a look inside too. She and Jack stumbled on Megatron and Starscream, and during the firefight that ensued, she shot Megatron's arm, causing him to blast the ceiling and causing a cave in. After the floor fell away, she lost track of the others, but eventually found the kids, and was able to rescue Bulkhead from Starscream. The two Autobots and the kids escaped the mine and briefly considered ending the Decepticons then and there before deciding it wasn't what Optimus would have done. Though Arcee still looked tempted.

In "T.M.I", Arcee accompanied Prime and Bumblebee as they tried to retrieve a [[Cybertronian data cylinder]] before the Decepticons did. During the fight she was tackled by Knock Out. Ultimately the Decepticons made off with the cylinder. Back at base, they discovered that Bulkhead had been zapped in the head with the data when Miko triggered its fail-safe. She went with Optimus when they tried to bargain for the cylinder.

In "One Shall Fall", when an ancient prophecy looked like it was imminent, Arcee and Bulkhead wondered how seriously they should take it. They accompanied Optimus to a military base to stop the Decepticons attacking it, but when they were faced with Raf being gravely injured, Optimus ordered Arcee to accompany him and Bumblebee back to base. While Ratchet fought to save the boy's life, Arcee had to keep Bumblebee calm.

In "One Shall Rise: Part 1", Arcee accompanied Bulkhead and Ratchet on a mission to rescue Prime from an area rich in Dark Energon, though at one point she appeared to become mesmerized by the sight of a volcano spewing Dark Energon. Once they got Optimus back to base, they set about investigating the cause of the natural disasters that had begun plaguing the planet, and realized that [[Unicron]] lay at the center of the Earth. Arcee and the other Autobots began checking out the sites of the tremors.

In "One Shall Rise: Part 2", though Optimus ordered the other Autobots to remain at base, Arcee, Bulkhead and Bumblebee joined him anyway. They fought increasingly larger stone Unicrons, until they encountered a colossal one that knocked Bulkhead and Bumblebee aside, then sent Arcee likewise tumbling along the ground. As it moved to crush Optimus underfoot, help came in the unlikely form of Megatron, who offered to help them fight Unicron. After they returned to base, Optimus gave the trio the choice of whether to accompany him and Megatron to Earth's core, and Arcee opted to go for Jack's sake. She, Bumblebee and Bulkhead greeted Megatron to the Autobot base by aiming their guns at him, and when they were ready to GroundBridge to their new destination, she insisted Megatron go first. Before long, they were standing within Earth's core.

In "One Shall Rise: Part 3", as the Autobots battled Unicron's antibodies, Arcee was briefly separated from the others, and had to ride one of the antibodies to catch up with them again. She, Bulkhead and Bumblebee remained outside Unicron's spark chamber to fight off the antibodies. After Unicron's defeat, they entered the chamber, only to discover that Optimus had lost his memories and that Megatron had tricked him into siding with the Decepticons.

====Season 2====
In "Orion Pax: Part 2 and 3", Arcee acts as Jack's chaperone on Cybertron when the boy goes to retrieve the collective wisdom of the Primes from [[Vector Sigma]], and holds off both an [[Insecticon]] and Megatron himself to allow for Optimus' return. Arcee would later be at Airachnid's mercy, only to be saved by Starscream, who then drove Airachnid away, before repaying his debt to Arcee for sparing him when he was at her mercy by releasing her.

While waiting to hear from Bulkhead (who had become trapped aboard the Nemesis,) Ratchet picks up as unusual readings come from where they last encountered Airachnid and her Insecticon. Arcee join Optimus and Bumblebee to the location of the readings, where they find Airachnid sending her Insecticons to attack the Nemesis. They decide to take down Airachnid, but she orders her rear guard to attack them while she tries to escape. Arcee follows Airachnid, leaving Optimus and Bumblebee to deal with the Insecticons. Airachnid travels underground and Arcee follows her into a cavern that houses the Insecticon's now empty Stasis Pods. Airachnid tries to sneak up on Arcee, but she seeing Airachnid's reflection in one of the pods and dodges just in time. She manages to corner Airachnid who realizing she has lost, goads Arcee into making it hurt, as she would have done to Arcee. Despite having her hated enemy at her mercy, Arcee responds to Airachnid's goading by saying "''I'm not like you.''" Airachnid uses the opportunity to turn the tables on Arcee, but ends up landing on an empty Insecticon stasis pod which activates, trapping Airachnid in stasis lock. Arcee, Optimus, and Bumblebee transport the stasis pod holding Airachnid to their base for safekeeping. Optimus commends Arcee for her actions and better judgement.

In "Flying Mind", Arcee is one of the Autobots who attacks the Nemesis, but is put in stasis like the rest of them until the Nemesis is emptied of Dark Energon. In "Tunnel Vision", Arcee and Bumblebee are sent after the first relic from the Iacon Data Base which the ship was able to decode. Jack and Miko accompany them into New York, but they are separated later. Arcee and Bumblebee have a fight with Knock Out and his insecticon partner. Arcee was able to kill the Insecticon by tricking it into stepping on the third rail of the subway track. She and Bumblebee were able to obtain the relic, the [[Phase Shifter(Transformers)|Phase Shifter]]. In "''Hurt''", she, Jack, Bumblebee, and Miko victoriously return to base with the Phase Shifter, only to find Ratchet desperately trying to stabilize a critically injured Bulkhead. Arcee and the others learn of Bulkhead's ordeal with [[Tox-En(Transformers)|Tox-En]] and encounter with the Insecticon [[Bombshell (Transformers)|Hardshell]]. She tries to go after Miko when she runs off (being able to relate to what she is going through), but Optimus stops her saying she needs sometime alone.

In the episode "New Recruit", when the new Autobot [[Smokescreen (Transformers)|Smokescreen]] arrives on Earth, Arcee does not trust him as she remembers when Makeshift infiltrated the base. In the episode "Legacy", Arcee is angered by Smokescreen's action that caused the Autobots to be seen by a human. When Optimus assigns Smokescreen to be tutored about living on Earth by Jack, Arcee shows great concern about his safety. Later, after being led astray by [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] with a decoy to distract the Autobots from the [[Star Saber]]. When Ratchet alerts them of the situation (in which Smokescreen and Jack were being attacked), Arcee rushes to Jack's aid and kills the Insecticons attacking him. After the battle in which Optimus obtains the Star Saber, Arcee is enraged at Smokescreen for putting Jack in danger.

In the episode "Alpha; Omega", Arcee learns from Optimus about the final four [[Iacon]] relics, the [[Omega Keys]], which together have the power to revive Cybertron. At first, Arcee and the others are excited to return to their homeworld, but they realize that they do not want to leave because of their human friends. Arcee is sent to find the first Omega Key, and Smokescreen accompanies her. They find the key, but they discover Megatron, with the arm of a Prime and his new weapon, the Dark Star Saber. Arcee watches as Megatron seemingly kills Smokescreen, and allows her to live, to deliver Optimus the message to face him for the relic. But after the battle, Arcee sees that Smokescreen is alive, thanks to the Phase Shifter.

In "Hard Knocks", Arcee and Bumblebee go to retrieve the second Omega Key, but Knock Out attacks them with Soundwave's [[Resance Blaster (Transformers)|Resance Blaster]]. In "Inside Job", Arcee happily congratulates Smokescreen for getting two of the Omega Keys to the Autobots. When Starscream contacts the Autobots about the final Omega Key, Arcee is concerned whether or not they can trust Starscream. In "Regeneration", Arcee takes the [[Apex Armor (Transformers)|Apex Armor]] with her when the Autobots return to Cybertron. With it she is able to defeat the Decepticons and retrieve the Omega Keys with the other Autobots. However, in "Darkest Hour", she and the others are forced to give the keys when Megatron threatens to expose the newly kidnapped children to Cybertron's toxic atmosphere. Megatron then tries to reformat Earth into a metallic planet like Cybertron with the Omega Lock forcing Optimus to destroy it with the Star Saber.

====Season 3====
In the opening arc of the third season, ''Beast Hunters'', Arcee and Jack are on their own, trying to avoid the Decepticons. After a close encounter with the Decepticons, they escape and eventually find Optimus Prime's second-in-command, [[Ultra Magnus]], who reveals that Arcee is one of five Autobot life signals that he detected on Earth. Eventually, they find Bulkhead, Wheeljack, Ratchet and Bumblebee, the last of whom has a new paint scheme created by reversing his colors. Arcee makes the remark that were she to do the same, she would be pink (a nod to the color scheme of her Generation 1 counterpart.) She later participates in the attack on [[Darkmount]] and retreats with the other Autobots after a recently upgraded Optimus Prime destroys the fortress.

In the episode "Plus One", Arcee is sent with Wheeljack after a [[Predacon]] remain. After the two defeat a group of Vehicons easily, Arcee talks with Wheeljack about his current problems with Ultra Magnus. She learns that Wheeljack's real problem was with Bulkhead as he has gone soft. She tells him that he'll always have the [[Wreckers (Transformers)|Wreckers]] as he knew them and also says not to push Bulkhead away, as if something were to happen to him, he'd never forgive himself, speaking from experience of losing two partners. After they get the Predacon spine, Arcee is contacted by Jack, who tells her that June and Fowler were captured. She and Wheeljack find Knock Out and pursue him. Arcee fights with the Insecticons, and tests her new powerful blaster on them. Knock Out escapes, but June and Fowler are saved.

In "Deadlock", the final episode, Arcee leads Stealth Team to storm the Omega Lock, where they are met by Starscream, who Arcee fights. After the Autobots defeat the Decepticons and restore Cybertron, she has to return to Cybertron to help rebuild. She has a heartfelt goodbye with Jack, telling him to keep in touch, and emotionally leaving afterwards.

====''Predacons Rising'' movie====
Afterwards, in the epilogue movie "Predacons Rising", she and the other Autobots-save Ratchet, who remained behind on Earth-return to Cybertron and witness Bumblebee's ceremony of promotion to the rank of warrior. Optimus and Wheeljack then depart to locate the long lost [[AllSpark]], leaving Arcee and the others to safeguard Cybertron. Major trouble soon arrives in the form of new Predacons cloned by Shockwave and Starscream, as well as the return of Unicron in Megatron's resuscitated and upgraded body. Along with the other Autobots, Arcee participates in defending Primus from Unicron and his army of [[Terrorcons]]. She also has an exchange with Bumblebee in which she expresses her admiration of how much he's matured, and is complimented by him in turn. Unicron is defeated and the Decepticons are formally dissolved by a penitent Megatron, and Optimus Prime returns the AllSpark to Cybertron after becoming one with it to protect it from Unicron. Arcee and the others are thus left to watch as new life comes to Cybertron. 

Originally, Arcee was going to team up with [[Airachnid]] after Megatron betrayed her however during the climax, Airachnid would've backstabbed her and resurrect her insecticons only for them to become savage and they devour the two of them. This was scrapped because it was deemed too dark.

===''Robots in Disguise''===
Although she doesn't appeared in the series, a picture of her shown and was along with the list of Autobots who were backlisted by the Decepticons disguised as the new High Council for being a supporter of Optimus Prime following the restoration of Cybertron after the Great War. In her picture, she resembles her G1 Counterpart but is still colored blue.

===Relationships===
*'''[[Cliffjumper]]''' - Arcee, at first, seemed indifferent and even a little hostile towards Cliffjumper at first, as she told Starscream to "go ahead and slag himself" when he threatened to kill Cliffjumper in order to get information from her during flashbacks in Out of the Past. Later on in the episode, she saved his life, but then made it clear that she didn't want him around. Cliffjumper, however, acted very differently as he told Shockwave to leave Arcee alone and use the Cortical Phycic Patch on him instead (something Shockwave did not do) and got distressed to the point of threatening to kill Starscream and Shockwave after Arcee apparently died at their hand (as it turned out, she was playing possum to get the 'Cons offguard) It was Cliffjumper who managed to reach Arcee through the shell she had created for herself due to the trauma she faced after witnessing Tailgate's murder. By the end of the episode, the two of them had begun to get along, with Arcee finally accepting Cliffjumper as a friend. Cliffjumper's death at the hands of Starscream seemed to reopen old wounds as she had to face the pain of losing another partner. She was distraught when she found out that the Decepticons had turned his body into a Terrorcon zombie, to the point that she collapsed upon returning to their base. Arcee continues to grieve for him throughout the first season, as she is shown talking to his grave site and then promising to avenge his death.
*'''[[Optimus Prime]]''' - Arcee is one of Optimus' right hand soldiers. Even though Optimus is taller than Arcee, she's his best fighter, his "go to gal" whenever he needs someone to talk with. Arcee sees Optimus Prime as a great leader and friend, even stating to Ratchet once that she would give her life for him. She informally serves as his second in command, although it is worth noting that she has been known to occasionally disregard his orders - due to her overwhelming desire to seek vengeance upon her enemies, like [[Airachnid]]. Despite this, Arcee appears much closer to Optimus than the other [[Autobots]]. The two were together when they discovered [[Cliffjumper]] had been killed. Later Arcee accompanied Optimus to find Cliffjumper's body after its life signal appeared online, where Optimus gave her cover fire as he shot through several [[Vehicon|Decepticons]]. She and Optimus went alongside each other to the Arctic. After failing to retrieve what they wanted, the two were stranded there together as Ratchet, Bulkhead and Bumblebee tried to fix the base after it was attacked by [[Scraplets]]. She related to Optimus her surprise to die in an Arctic, rather than by the hands of the Decepticons. Arcee is seen to hang out with Optimus and talk with him. Arcee never argues with Optimus or show any rage towards him. Arcee would comfort Optimus or even help him get to his feet. She respects Optimus and sees him as a true leader and friend to have. Optimus protects and sees Arcee as a strong soldier and friend. Arcee seems to know a lot about being a Prime. She indicates Optimus not being the party type of bot and that he never runs from a fight. As a leader, Optimus always ensure the safety of his team, which includes Arcee's safety.
* '''[[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]]''' - Arcee may be looked up to by Bumblebee, possibly due to her skills and overall personality. She has previously addressed Bumblebee as 'family' rather than 'friend,' and appears to regard him as something of a younger brother. Bumblebee and Arcee are shown to fight together in battle. Arcee never argued with Bumblebee and seemed to comfort him whenever he felt impaired. Bumblebee would save or protect Arcee from any danger. The two were together during Jack's initial meeting with the Autobots and fought Vehicons together before Bulkhead arrived. She, Bumblebee and the other Autobots fought against Knock Out and Breakdown during their attempt to steal the Energon Harvester, which proved successful as the Autobots were defeated. She and Bumblebee went to retrieve two relics together, only coming back successful for the first and failing to secure the second. She met back up with Bumblebee and Ratchet when Ultra Magnus found the two. She complimented Bumblebee on his new paint job, citing that if she had also reversed her colors, she would be pink. She later teamed up with on the assault at Darkmount and was made his commander in the "Stealth Team". She was shocked when Bumblebee died and even more surprised when he was revived, and later told him that his voice had returned. In ''Predacons Rising'', Arcee told Bumblebee that he has proved his mettle in battle and on the team. Bee referred her as a powerful little two wheeler. This clearly implies the two have feelings for each other.
*'''[[Smokescreen (Transformers)|Smokescreen]]''' - Arcee suspected Smokescreen as a Decepticon spy when he first arrived, but she later worried for him as he was not being careful about contact with humans. After many attempts on his part to be a hero she scolded him like a mother. When Smokescreen was seemingly killed by the [[Dark Star Saber]], Arcee mourned losing another partner. She was surprised and relieved when he used [[Phase Shifter]] and it had saved his life. When Smokescreen seemed to care more about his ego than restoring Cybertron she lashed out at him, despite Optimus telling her that she made her point. This caused Smokescreen to drive away in a huff, which led to him being captured by Soundwave. After Smokescreen returned uninjured from the Nemesis with two Omega Keys, she finally gave him the respect he had rightfully earned. She came to have more respect for him after it was implied he played a vital role in saving Optimus Prime's and all the other Autobots' lives.
* '''[[Wheeljack]]''' - Wheeljack and Arcee are two opposites of the same warrior. When Wheeljack almost abandoned the team, Arcee stepped in to help Wheeljack. They both went to get a Predacons bone and talk about Wheeljack's problem. Wheeljack had a little problem with his new commander, Ultra Magnus. But that wasn't the main problem, it was Bulkhead becoming "soft". Wheeljack and Bulkhead used to be serious in the Wreckers and they would do whatever it takes to complete their mission. Arcee told Wheeljack to not push Bulkhead away because she knows how it feels to lose a partner. Wheeljack was feeling a little better, thanks to Arcee's pep talk. After that, Wheeljack started to become a team player and has respect for Ultra Magnus and Bulkhead. Wheeljack and Arcee are like two lone wolves. They prefer to work alone, even though they would do whatever it takes to be a true team player on their team.
*'''[[Megatron]]''' - When Arcee and Bumblebee snuck aboard the Nemesis to retrieve a cure for Optimus, Arcee saw Megatron's unconscious body. After Bumblebee succeeded in getting the formula from Megatron, Arcee shot the latter's life support cord out of his body. During the Autobots attempt to get Optimus Prime back, Megatron attacked and defeated Bumblebee, Ratchet, Bulkhead and Orion Pax before Arcee came through the Space Bridge and knocked him in the back. She briefly fought the Decepticon, being able to dodge several of his blasts before being grabbed and put against a wall by the Decepticon leader. After Optimus was revived with the Key to Vector Sigma, Arcee and the other Autobots participated in shooting at the Decepticon before retreating through a GroundBridge. After Megatron abandoned the Decepticons in ''Predacons Rising'', Arcee may have forgiven Megatron.
*'''[[Starscream]]''' - Initially, Arcee held no anger towards Starscream significantly, as he was of no more significance to her than any other Decepticon. She, Bulkhead and Bumblebee stopped him from torturing [[List of Transformers: Prime characters#Humans|William Fowler]] after he had Soundwave capture the latter for interrogation for discovery of the location of the Autobot base. Soon enough, she stopped him from causing any harm to Bulkhead, whom was preoccupied stopping a tunnel from falling, instead having Starscream do so. Shortly afterwards, she was shocked to see Starscream willing to join the Autobots. The group discussed his motives and ultimately agreed that they would give him a chance. Arcee was left alone with him, this proving fatal as she discovered he had murdered Cliffjumper. Angered, she chose to attack him. However, not before giving him the keys to his cuffs. As she came closer, Starscream cowered and begged for mercy. As she reached to grab the keys, he jabbed her in the side with his sharp fingers and attacked her. During the ensuring battle, she gained the upper hand on the Decepticon and came close to finishing him off before Bumblebee arrived on the scene. The two would next met after the Autobots went to the location Starscream had told Ratchet and Bulkhead of. Starscream saved Arcee's life by shooting at Airachnid and thereby, driving his fellow rogue Decepticon off before she could finish Arcee off. Though Arcee expected Starscream to finish her off, Starscream remembered their last encounter and how she had allowed him to live. As such, he did the same for her, cutting her down from her hanging place and walking off after doing so.
*'''[[Airachnid]]''' - Arcee was trapped by Airachnid during the Great War on [[Cybertron]], alongside her partner [[Tailgate (Transformers)|Tailgate]]. However, she was the only one of the two to survive as Airachnid killed Tailgate after Arcee claimed to have not known anything. Soon enough, Arcee was saved by Bumblebee and Cliffjumper, dragged off with the guilt of not being able to save her partner from his death. The two would meet again on [[Earth]], Arcee instantly recognizing her ship while scouting with her new ally, human [[Jack Darby]]. Despite Arcee's initial inability to defeat the Decepticon, she summed up the strength and saved Jack from Airachnid. The two crossed paths again when Airachnid allied with MECH and kidnapped June Darby. Arcee's next confrontation with Airachnid would be during a mission with the other Autobots when Airachnid left Starscream alone. Upon seeing her, she chased after Airachnid and fought her before being placed in a headlock. She was saved by Optimus and forced to remain behind when Optimus realized that Arcee's longing to avenge Tailgate would only continue to cloud her judgment. Arcee and Airachnid met up again when Airachnid had her new Insecticon attack Megatron. Arcee ran off on her own again and managed to nearly get killed before being saved by Starscream, whom also held a vendetta against the Decepticon. Their next and final encounter would be when Airachnid launched her Insecticon army to destroy Megatron. After aiming at Airachnid, she had the lower fleet of her Insecticons attack Arcee and the other Autobots. After coming down to face her, Arcee attacked and pursued her until Airachnid accidentally landed in an Insecticon pod, cryogenically freezing her and causing the entirety of the Insecticons to join Megatron. Optimus was proud of Arcee and told her that she was stronger for the choice she made of not killing Airachnid. Originally in Predacons Rising, they were suppose to team up after Megatron betrayed Airachnid only for her to betray Arcee during the climax and resurrect her insecticons only for them to immediately turn savage and devour Arcee and Airachnid.

'''''Archie and Me''''' was a comic book title published by [[Archie comics]] from [[1964 in comics|1964]] to [[1987 in comics|1987]]. Most issues and covers focused on the interaction of [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]] and the school principal, [[Mr. Weatherbee]].  This suggests that Mr. Weatherbee is the "Me" mentioned in the title, whereas the "Me" in ''[[Archie's Rival Reggie|Reggie and Me]]'' and ''Betty and Me'' appeared to refer to Archie Andrews himself.

'''Artistic billiards''', sometimes called '''fantasy billiards''' or '''fantaisie classique''', is a [[carom billiards]] discipline in which players compete at performing 76 preset shots of varying difficulty. Each set shot has a maximum point value assigned for perfect execution, ranging from a four-point maximum for lowest level difficulty shots, and climbing to an 11-point maximum for shots deemed highest in difficulty level. There are a total of 500 points available to a player, representing the combined value of a perfect score on all 76 shots, although not all games are played with the full shot catalogue. The governing body of the sport is the [[Confédération International de Billard Artistique]] (CIBA).

Each shot in an artistic billiards match is played from a well-defined position (in some venues within a  two millimetre tolerance), and each shot must unfold in an established manner. Players are allowed three attempts at each shot. In general, the shots making up the game &amp;ndash; even four-point shots &amp;ndash; require a high degree of skill, devoted practice and specialized knowledge to perform. Such shots often require extremes in [[Billiard techniques|shot-making techniques]] that are not often employed in other games, such as {{Cuegloss|Force follow|force follows}}, {{Cuegloss|Draw|force draws}}, precision multiple-rail {{Cuegloss|Kick shot|kicking}}, {{Cuegloss|Jump shot|jumps}} and {{Cuegloss|Massé|massés}} combined with outlandish use of {{Cuegloss|English|english}} ({{Cuegloss|Sidespin|sidespin}}). 

[[Image:Billard Artistique Figur A10.png|220px|thumb|A {{Cuegloss|Massé|massé}} shot around a pin; this is Figure A10, worth 10 points.]]
Players may use up to twenty separate [[cue stick|cues]] providing different performance functions.{{Fact|date=February 2010}} For example, performing massés may require a cue with a very large diameter terminus and a specialized {{Cuegloss|Cue tip|cue tip}}, while jumping may require a short, {{Cuegloss|Jump cue|light cue}} with a flat (rather than rounded), very hard and also wider cue tip than a playing cue. Some shots may require the use of props such as a small {{Cuegloss|Pin|pin}} placed precisely on the {{Cuegloss|Slate|table surface}} and around which the player is required to make the {{Cuegloss|Cue ball|cue ball}} pass on a designated side ''(see Figure A10 illustration)''. For the most part, top artistic billiard players specialize in the game to the exclusion of all others.{{Fact|date=February 2010}}

World title competition first started in 1986 and required the use of [[ivory]] balls. However, this requirement was dropped in 1990.{{Fact|date=February 2010}} The highest score ever achieved in world competition was 374, by the [[French people|Frenchman]] [[Jean Reverchon]] in 1992, while the highest score in competition overall is 427 set by the [[Belgian people|Belgian]] [[Walter Bax]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="EV"&gt;{{cite web

Some examples are ''coup fouetté'' ("whip shot"; a type of force follow); ''massé coulé'' (a massé shot with follow) and ''piqué'' (describes either a massé shot with no english, or a shot in which the cue stick is steeply angled, but not held quite as vertical as it is in full massé).{{Fact|date=February 2010}}

''BioShock'' is set in 1960. The player guides the protagonist, Jack, after his airplane crashes in the ocean near the [[bathysphere]] terminus that leads to the underwater city of [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]]. Built by the [[business magnate]] [[Andrew Ryan (BioShock)|Andrew Ryan]], the city was intended to be an isolated utopia, but the discovery of ADAM, a genetic material which can be used to grant superhuman powers, initiated the city's turbulent decline. Jack tries to find a way to escape, fighting through hordes of ADAM-obsessed enemies, and the iconic, deadly [[Big Daddy (BioShock)|Big Daddies]], while engaging with the few sane humans that remain and eventually learning of Rapture's past. The player, as Jack, is able to defeat foes in a number of ways by using weapons, utilizing plasmids that give unique powers, and by turning Rapture's own defenses against them.

''BioShock'' includes elements of [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]], giving the player different approaches in engaging enemies such as by stealth, as well as moral choices of saving or killing characters; additionally, the game and [[biopunk]] theme borrow concepts from the [[survival horror]] genre.

''BioShock'' received critical acclaim and was particularly praised by critics for its [[morality]]-based storyline, [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersive environments]], and its unique setting, and is considered to be one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]] and a demonstration of [[video games as an art form|video game as an art form]].

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
''BioShock'' is set in 1960 in the underwater city of Rapture; the city's history is mostly revealed via audio recordings the player can collect during the game.&lt;ref name="bit-tech"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=138851 |title=Xbox Preview: BioShock |publisher=CVG |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 5, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116175332/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=138851 |archivedate=January 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapture was planned and constructed in the 1940s by [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] [[business magnate]] [[Andrew Ryan (BioShock)|Andrew Ryan]] who wanted to create a [[utopia]] for society's elite to flourish outside of government control and "petty morality". Scientific progress greatly expanded, including the discovery of the genetic material "ADAM" created by [[sea slug]]s on the ocean floor. ADAM allows its users to alter their DNA to grant them super-human powers like [[telekinesis]] and [[pyrokinesis]]. To protect Rapture, Ryan imposed a law that no contact with the surface world was allowed.&lt;ref name="John 18–20"&gt;{{cite journal|last=John |first=Lanchester |date=January 1, 2009 |title=Is It Art? |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/john-lanchester/is-it-art |journal=[[London Review of Books]] |publisher=Nicholas Spice |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=18–20 |doi= |access-date=October 3, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005125352/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/john-lanchester/is-it-art |archivedate=October 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the apparent utopia, class distinctions grew, and former gangster and businessman Frank Fontaine used his influence of the lower class to plan a coup over Rapture. Fontaine profited by creating black market routes with the surface world, and together with Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum, created a cheap plasmid industry by mass-producing ADAM through the implantation of the slugs in the stomachs of orphaned girls, nicknamed "Little Sisters".  Fontaine used his plasmid-enhanced army to attack Ryan, but reportedly was killed in the battle. Ryan took the opportunity to seize his assets including the plasmid factories. In the months that followed, a second figure named Atlas rose to speak for the lower class, creating further strife. Atlas led attacks on the factories housing the Little Sisters, and Ryan countered by creating "Big Daddies", plasmid-enhanced humans surgically grafted into giant lumbering diving suits who were psychologically compelled to protect the Little Sisters at all costs.&lt;ref name="bit-tech" /&gt; Ryan also created his own army of plasmid-enhanced soldiers, named "Splicers", which he controlled using pheromones distributed through Rapture's air system.

Tension came to a head on New Year's Eve of 1958, when Atlas ordered an all-out attack on Ryan. The battle left many dead, and the few sane survivors barricaded themselves away. What once was a beautiful utopia had fallen into a crumbling [[dystopia]].&lt;ref name="IGN review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/813/813214p1.html |title=''BioShock'' Review |publisher=IGN |last=Onyett |first=Charles |date=August 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 16, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817035302/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/813/813214p1.html |archivedate=August 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the events described above are revisited and expanded upon in the downloadable expansion ''[[BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea]]'', which takes place in Rapture during the latter months of 1958 and leads up to Atlas' assault on Ryan's forces.

In 1960, at the start of the game, the protagonist, Jack, is a passenger on a plane that goes down in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/813/813641p1.html |title=''BioShock'' Review: Welcome to Rapture; at IGN |accessdate=October 7, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012044029/http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/813/813641p1.html |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioshock-online.com/faq/#about |title=''BioShock'' FAQs&amp;nbsp;– What is the game about? |accessdate=October 8, 2007 |date=December 30, 2006 |publisher=Through the Looking Glass |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011150416/http://bioshock-online.com/faq/ |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the only survivor, Jack makes his way to a nearby lighthouse that houses a [[bathysphere]] terminal that takes him to Rapture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.xbox360.ign.com/objects/793/793105.html |title=''BioShock'' |publisher=IGN |accessdate=October 7, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012183719/http://au.xbox360.ign.com/objects/793/793105.html |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack is contacted by Atlas via radio, and is guided to safety from the Splicers and the perils of the run down city. Atlas requests Jack's help in stopping Ryan, directing him to a docked bathysphere where he claims Ryan has trapped his family. When Jack encounters a wandering Little Sister and its fallen Big Daddy, Atlas urges Jack to kill the Little Sister to harvest her ADAM for himself; Dr. Tenenbaum overhears this and intercepts Jack before he harms the Little Sister, urging him to spare the child and any other Little Sisters he encounters, providing him with a plasmid that would force the sea slug out of her body.&lt;ref name="IGN water"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ign.com/Irrational_Games/2007/05/23/55572/ |title=IGN first look at the Little Sisters |publisher=IGN |date=May 23, 2007 |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103135013/http://blogs.ign.com/Irrational_Games/2007/05/23/55572/ |archivedate=November 3, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack eventually works his way to the bathysphere, but Ryan destroys it before Jack can reach it. Enraged, Atlas directs Jack towards Ryan's mansion through Ryan's army of Splicers and Big Daddies. At times, Jack is forced to travel through areas controlled by Ryan's allies that have now become deranged, such as the mad doctor J.S. Steinman or [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Sander Cohen|Sander Cohen]], a former musician and art dealer who now [[Schadenfreude|takes enjoyment]] in watching the death and misery of others.

Eventually, Jack enters Ryan's personal office, where Ryan is patiently waiting for Jack by casually playing golf. Ryan explains he fully knew of Atlas' plan, and explains that Jack is his illegitimate child, taken from his mother by Fontaine who placed him out of Ryan's reach on the surface, and genetically modified to age rapidly. Fontaine had planned to use Jack as a trump card in his war with Ryan, bringing him back to Rapture when the time was right; Jack's genetics would allow him to access systems such as the bathysphere that Ryan had locked out long ago. With no place to run, Ryan is willing to accept death by his own free will, quoting one of his own principles: "A man chooses. A slave obeys." He asks Jack "would you kindly" kill him with the golf club, and Jack is compelled to do so.&lt;ref name="vox sept2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/10/3/13112826/bioshock-video-games-art-choice |title=Bioshock proved that video games could be art |first=Peter |last=Suderman |date=October 3, 2016 |accessdate=October 3, 2016 |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003194002/http://www.vox.com/culture/2016/10/3/13112826/bioshock-video-games-art-choice |archivedate=October 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Ryan dies, Jack becomes aware that the phrase "would you kindly" has preceded many of Atlas' commands as a hypnotic trigger forcing him to follow Atlas' orders without question; a flashback reveals Jack himself was responsible for crashing his plane near the lighthouse after reading a letter containing the trigger phrase. Atlas reveals himself as Fontaine, having used the Atlas alias to hide himself while providing a figure for the lower class to rally behind. Without Ryan, Fontaine takes over control of Ryan's systems, and leaves Jack to die as he releases hostile security drones into Ryan's locked office.

Jack is saved by Dr. Tenenbaum and the Little Sisters who had previously been rescued. Dr. Tenenbaum helps Jack to remove Fontaine's conditioned responses, including one that would have stopped his heart. With the help of the Little Sisters, Jack is able to make his way to Fontaine's lair to face him. Fontaine, being cornered by Jack, injects himself with a large amount of ADAM, becoming an inhuman monster. Jack is aided by the Little Sisters in draining the ADAM in Fontaine's body and eventually killing him.

The ending depends on how the player interacted with the Little Sisters:
*If the player rescues ''all'' of the Little Sisters (or harvests only one of them), Jack takes them back to the surface with him and adopts five of them as his daughters, and Tenenbaum happily narrates how they go on to live full lives under his care, eventually surrounding him on his deathbed. This ending is considered canon in ''[[BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea]]''.
*If the player harvests more than one Little Sister, Jack turns on the Little Sisters to harvest their ADAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/793105/page_4.html |title=Guides: BioShock Guide (Xbox 360), BioShock Walkthrough |accessdate=January 21, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206081731/http://guides.ign.com/guides/793105/page_4.html |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tenenbaum sadly narrates what occurred, condemning Jack and his actions. A submarine then comes across the wreckage of the plane, and finds itself suddenly surrounded by bathyspheres containing Splicers who attack the crew and take control of it. The submarine is revealed to be carrying nuclear missiles, with Tenenbaum claiming that Jack has now "stolen the terrible secrets of the world":&lt;ref name="bioshock walkthrough"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebanshee.com/bioshock/walkthrough/fontaineslair.php |title=BioShock&amp;nbsp;– Fontaine's Lair Walkthrough |publisher=GameBanshee |accessdate=October 7, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018040421/http://gamebanshee.com/bioshock/walkthrough/fontaineslair.php |archivedate=October 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the more Little Sisters are harvested, the harsher and more furious Tenenbaum's narrative becomes.&lt;ref name="endings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.gamepressure.com/bioshock/guide.asp?ID=3351|title=BioShock&amp;nbsp;– Little Sisters and Big Daddies (SPOILERS!)&amp;nbsp;– Game Guide|publisher=GamePressure|accessdate=November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Bioshock enemies.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Big Daddy (BioShock)|Big Daddy]] defends a Little Sister (both on right) from two Splicers, while the player watches.]]

''BioShock'' is a [[first-person shooter]] with [[role-playing game]] customization and [[stealth game|stealth]] elements, and is similar to ''[[System Shock 2]]''. The player takes the role of Jack as he is guided through Rapture towards various objectives. The player collects various weapons and plasmids as they work their way through enemy forces. The player can switch between one active weapon and one active plasmid at any time, allowing them to find combination attacks that can be effective against certain enemies, such as first shocking a Splicer then striking them down with a wrench. Weapons are limited by ammunition that the player collects; many weapons have secondary ammo types that can be used instead for additional benefits, such as bullets that inflict fire damage. Plasmid use consumes a serum called EVE which can be restored using EVE syringes collected by the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ggmania.com/full.php3?show=5856 |title=Gameguru reviews ''BioShock'' |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |date=September 17, 2007 |publisher=Game Guru Mania |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109125451/http://www.ggmania.com/full.php3?show=5856 |archivedate=November 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The player has a health meter that decreases when they take damage. The player can restore their health with medical packs found throughout Rapture. If the player's health reduces to zero, they will be regenerated at the last Vita-Chamber that they passed with limited amounts of health and EVE. A patch for the game allows players to disable these Vita-Chambers, requiring players to restart a saved game if the character dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2007/12/new-bioshock-content-patch-now-available.ars |title=New Bioshock content, patch now available |first=Frank |last=Caron |date=December 4, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2011 |publisher=Ars Technica |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531142047/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2007/12/new-bioshock-content-patch-now-available.ars |archivedate=May 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game provides several options for players to face challenges. In addition to direct combat, the player can use plasmids to lure enemies into traps or to turn enemies against each other, or employ stealth tactics to avoid detection by hostiles including the security systems and turrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ic-games.co.uk/index.php?location=1&amp;&amp;articleid=3877 | title = ''BioShock'' (Xbox 360/PC) at ic-games.com | accessdate = November 4, 2007 | publisher = IC Games | first = James | last = Collins | date = August 22, 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011233114/http://ic-games.co.uk/index.php?location=1&amp;&amp;articleid=3877| archivedate = October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] into any of Rapture's automated systems; the hacking process is done via a mini-game similar to ''[[Pipe Mania]]'' where the player must connect two points on opposite sides of a grid with a limited set of piping within a fixed amount of time, with failure to complete in time costing health and potentially sounding alarms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox.about.com/od/xbox360reviews/fr/bioshockrev.htm |title=''BioShock'' Review (X360) at Xbox.about.com |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |first=Eric |last=Qualls |publisher=[[About.com]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025041435/http://xbox.about.com/od/xbox360reviews/fr/bioshockrev.htm |archivedate=October 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CenturionElite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gametz.com/Review/1654.html |title=''BioShock'' (Xbox 360) review by Gametz |author=CenturionElite |accessdate=November 16, 2007 |date=August 29, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112093422/http://gametz.com/Review/1654.html |archivedate=November 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the game, the player is given a research camera; by taking photographs of enemies, the player will cumulatively gain knowledge about the individual foes which translates into attack boosts and other benefits when facing that enemy type in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebanshee.com/bioshock/weapons/researchcamera.php |title=Research Camera |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |publisher=GameBanshee |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217141921/http://www.gamebanshee.com/bioshock/weapons/researchcamera.php |archivedate=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player collects money by exploring Rapture and from the bodies of defeated foes; this money can be used at vending machines to restock on ammunition, health and EVE, and other items; like security cameras, vending machines can also be hacked to reduce the costs of items from it.&lt;ref name="CenturionElite"/&gt; The player will also receive rewards in the form of ADAM from completing some tasks, as well as from either saving or killing the Little Sisters after defeating their Big Daddy guardian. ADAM is used to purchase new plasmids from Gatherer's Garden machines scattered around Rapture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/32465?from=30&amp;comments_per_page=30 |title=''BioShock'' morality |first=Julian |last=Murdoch |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |publisher=Gamers With Jobs |date=June 5, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110232605/http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/32465?from=30&amp;comments_per_page=30 |archivedate=November 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to plasmids, the player will also collect and buy tonics that provide passive bonuses, such as increasing Jack's strength, using EVE more efficiently, or making Jack more resistant to damage. The player can only have a limited number of plasmids and tonics active at any time, and can swap between the various plasmids and tonics at certain stations located throughout Rapture.&lt;ref name="bit-tech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/08/21/bioshock_gameplay_review/3 |title=''BioShock'' Gameplay Review (page 2) |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |date=August 21, 2007 |first=Joe |last=Martin |publisher=[[Bit-tech]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011130758/http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/08/21/bioshock_gameplay_review/3 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Game design===
Lead developer Ken Levine had created Irrational Games in 1997 out of former members from [[Looking Glass Studios]]. Their first game was ''[[System Shock 2]]'', a sequel to Looking Glass's ''[[System Shock]]'', and was met with critical success, though it did not prove a financial one. Levine had attempted to pitch a sequel to ''System Shock 2'' to [[Electronic Arts]], but the publisher rejected the idea based on the poor performance of the earlier game.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; Irrational would proceed to develop other games, including ''[[Freedom Force (2002 video game)|Freedom Force]]'', ''[[Tribes: Vengeance]]'', the cancelled title ''Deep Cover'', and the completed ''The Lost'' which was never released due to legal complications, but at this point, Levine wanted to return to a game in the same style as ''System Shock 2'', a more free-form game with strong narrative.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-17-the-true-story-of-bioshock |title=Rapture leaked: The true story behind the making of BioShock |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=April 17, 2014 |accessdate=April 22, 2014 |first=Simon |last=Parkin |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421234418/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-17-the-true-story-of-bioshock |archivedate=April 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edge history"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-bioshock/ | title = The Making Of: BioShock | date = July 23, 2012 | accessdate = November 1, 2016 | work = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531030452/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-bioshock/ | archivedate=May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the team had come up with a core gameplay mechanic idea based on three groups of forces; drones that would carry a desirable resource, protectors that would guard the drones, and harvesters that would attempt to take the resource from the drones; these would eventually bear out as the Little Sisters, Big Daddies, and splicers in the final game, but at the time of the concept, there was no set theme.&lt;ref name="edge history"/&gt; They began working on creating a setting for the game as to be able to pitch the idea to game publishers.&lt;ref name="edge history"/&gt; A 2002 demonstration version was based on the Unreal Engine 2 for the first [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; This demonstration was primarily set aboard a space station overtaken with genetically-mutated monsters; the main character was Carlos Cuello, a "cult [[Deprogramming|deprogrammer]]"—a person charged with rescuing someone from a [[cult]], and mentally and psychologically readjusting that person to a normal life.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shacknews original story"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48731 |title=Levine: ''BioShock'' Originally About Cult Deprogrammer (Updated) |date=August 30, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2007 |first=Chris |last=Remo |publisher=Shacknews |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235653/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48731 |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Levine cites an example of what a cult deprogrammer does: "[There are] people who hired people to [for example] deprogram their daughter who had been in a lesbian relationship. They kidnap her and reprogram her, and it was a really dark person, and that was the [kind of] character that you were."&lt;ref name="shacknews spoiler interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ken Levine on ''BioShock'': The Spoiler Interview |url=http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=539 |date=August 20, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2007 |first=Chris |last=Remo |publisher=Shacknews |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016213627/http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=539 |archivedate=October 16, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This story would have been more political in nature, with the character hired by a [[United States Senate|Senator]].&lt;ref name="shacknews spoiler interview"/&gt; The team collectively agreed that this game was not what they had set out to make, and were having trouble finding a publisher.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; They considered ending development, but as news about their efforts to make a [[spiritual successor]] to ''System Shock 2'' began to appear in gaming magazines and websites, the team opted to continue development, performing a full revamp the game.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt;

By 2004, 2K Games, a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive, offered to publish the game primarily based on the drone/protector/harvester concept, giving Irrational the freedom to develop the story and setting.&lt;ref name="edge history"/&gt; By this point, the story and setting had changed significantly, taking place in an abandoned World War II-era Nazi laboratory that had been recently unearthed by 21st century scientists. Over the decades, the genetic experiments within the labs had gradually formed themselves into an ecosystem centered on the three groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BioShock First Look – Exclusive First Impressions | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-first-look-exclusive-first-impressions/1100-6110044/ | date= October 10, 2004 | accessdate = August 2, 2008| first = Andrew | last = Park | publisher = Gamespot }}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of game included many of the gameplay elements that would remain in the final ''BioShock'', themselves influenced by concepts from ''System Shock 2''. These elements included the use of plasmids and EVE, the need to use stealth or other options to deal with automated security systems, direction through the environment from a non-player character relayed over a radio, and story elements delivered through audio recordings and "ghosts" of deceased characters.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/bioshock/news.html?page=1&amp;sid=6150533&amp;tag=result;title;0 | title=E3 06: ''BioShock'' Gameplay Demo Impressions | publisher = Gamespot | date=May 10, 2006|accessdate = November 4, 2007 | author = Brad Shoemaker and Andrew Park }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/08/21/bioshock_gameplay_review/6 |title=''BioShock'' Gameplay Review&amp;nbsp;– Overlooked details |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |date=August 21, 2007 |first=Joe |last=Martin |publisher=Bit-Tech |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011122106/http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/08/21/bioshock_gameplay_review/6 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebanshee.com/interviews/bioshock1.php |title=''BioShock'' Interview |publisher=Gamebanshee |date=June 13, 2007 |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |first=Jon |last=Birnbaum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011195300/http://gamebanshee.com/interviews/bioshock1.php |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the gameplay with the 2004 reveal was similar to what resulted in the released version of ''BioShock'', both design and story underwent changes, consistent with what Levine says was then-Irrational Games' guiding principle of putting game design first.&lt;ref name = "shacknews original story"/&gt; These areas were also issued due to some internal strife and lack of communication between the various teams within Irrational, part of the result of having to expand the team from six to sixty members for the scope of the project.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; The environment was considered bland, and there were difficulties by the team's artists to come up with a consistent vision to meet the level designer's goals.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; A critical junction was a short experiment performed by level designer Jean Paul LeBreton and artist Hoagy de la Plante, setting themselves aside to co-develop a level that would later become part of the "Tea Garden" area in the released game, which Levine would later use as a prime example of a "great ''BioShock'' space", emphasizing the need for departments to work together.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; Levine also found that the cyberpunk theme had been overplayed considering their initial reject from Electronic Arts for ''System Shock 3'', leading towards the underwater setting of Rapture.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt;

===Story and theme development===
[[File:Objectivist1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A visit to the [[GE Building]] and its [[Atlas (statue)|statue of Atlas]] in New York City was the principal idea that led to the art deco stylings of ''BioShock''.]] 
The thematic core of ''BioShock'' was born when Levine was walking at [[Rockefeller Center]] near the [[GE Building]] in New York City. He saw the uniqueness of the [[art deco]] styling of the building along with imagery around the building such as the [[Atlas (statue)|statue of Atlas]] near it, and recognized that these were spaces that had not been experienced in the first-player shooter genre.&lt;ref name="edge history"/&gt; The history of the Rockefeller Center also fed into the story concept; Levine noted how the Center had started construction prior to the [[Great Depression]] of the 1920s; when the primary financiers had pulled out, [[John D. Rockefeller]] backed the remaining construction to complete the project himself, as stated by ''Edge'' magazine "a great man building an architectural triumph against all the odds".&lt;ref name="edge history"/&gt; The history of Rapture and the character of Andrew Ryan is loosely based on Rockefeller's story.&lt;ref name="edge history"/&gt; He also considered that many of the characters of Rapture were all people who were oppressed once before in the lives and now free of that oppression, have turned around and become the oppressors, a fact he felt resonated throughout human history.&lt;ref name="glixel sept2016"/&gt;

At this point in the development, the backdrop of Rapture had been fleshed out, but they had yet to come on how to represent the drones, protectors, and harvesters from their original game idea. The Big Daddy concept as the protector class was developed early in the process, but the team had yet to reach a satisfying design for the drones, having used several possible designs including bugs and dogs in wheelchairs.&lt;ref name="edge history"/&gt; The team wanted to have the player care for the drones in some way and create pathos for these characters. The idea of using little girls came out of brainstorming, but was controversial and shocking within the team at first, recognizing that they could easily be killed and make the game more horrific in the style of ''[[Night Trap]]''.&lt;ref name="edge history"/&gt; However, as Levine worked on the story, he started to incorporate the ideas of dystopian and utopian thinkers from the twentieth century, including [[Ayn Rand]], [[Aldous Huxley]], and [[George Orwell]], and considered their ideas "fascinating".&lt;ref name="ign myths"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/704/704806p1.html |title=The Influence of Literature and Myth in Videogames |first=Douglass C. |last=Perry |publisher=IGN |date=May 26, 2006 |accessdate=October 7, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104025910/http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/704/704806p1.html |archivedate=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He brought in the ideas of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] that Rand primarily outlined in the book ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', that man should be driven by selfishness and not altruism, and used this to inform the philosophy behind the city of Rapture and Andrew Ryan's work, tied in with his previous observations on Rockefeller and his writings.&lt;ref name="edge history"/&gt; This was extended to the use of the little girls as drones (now Little Sisters), particularly the question whether the player should try to save the girls or harvest the ADAM for their own benefit.&lt;ref name="edge history"/&gt; 2K Games expressed concern about the initial mechanic of the Little Sisters, where the player would actively prey on the Little Sister, which would have alerted a Big Daddy and setting up the fight with the player. This approach did not sit well with Levine, and 2K Games asserted that they would not ship a game "where the player gets punished for doing the right thing".&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; They altered this approach where the Little Sisters would be invulnerable until the player had dealt with their Big Daddy, though LeBreton considered this "a massive kludge" into the game's fiction.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edge history"/&gt; The idea of creating the Little Sisters and presenting the player with this choice became a critical part of the game's appeal to the larger gaming market though would still be met with criticism from some outlets.&lt;ref name="edge history"/&gt; Levine desired only to have one ending to the game, something that would have left the fate of the characters "much more ambiguous", but publisher pressure directed them to craft multiple endings depending on the choice of harvesting Little Sisters.&lt;ref name="glixel sept2016"/&gt; Levine also noted that "it was never my intention to do two endings for the game. It sort of came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-diving-deeper-into-bioshocks-story/1100-6179423/ |title=Q&amp;A: Diving deeper into ''BioShock''s story |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |publisher=Gamespot |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011144853/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-diving-deeper-into-bioshocks-story/1100-6179423/ |archivedate=October 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other elements came into the story design. Levine had an interest in "stem cell research and the moral issues that go around &lt;nowiki&gt;[it]&lt;/nowiki&gt;".&lt;ref name="ign myths"/&gt; In regard to artistic influences, Levine cited the books ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and ''[[Logan's Run]]'', representing societies that have "really interesting ideas screwed up by the fact that we're people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=77456 |title=Big Daddy speaks |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |first=Johnny |last=Minkley |date=June 8, 2007 |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821030637/http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=77456 |archivedate=August 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the mind control used on Jack was offered by LeBreton, inspired by films like ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', as a means to provide a better reason to limit the player's actions as opposed to the traditional use of locked doors to prevent them exploring areas they should not. The team had agreed that Jack's actions would be controlled by a key phrase but struggled with coming up with one that would not reveal Atlas' true nature. Levine happened upon "Would you kindly" after working on marketing materials for the game that asked the reader hypothetical questions such as "Would you kill people, even innocent people, to survive?", later working that phrase into the first script for the game.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt;

Numerous tensions within the team and from publisher 2K Games continued during the development process. According to LeBreton, Levine was distrustful of some of the more egotistical newer hires and was often arguing with them to enforce his vision of ''BioShock''.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; 2K Games was concerned with the growing budget for the title, and told Levine to market the title more as a first-person shooter rather than the first-person shooter/role player game hybrid they set out for.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; Near the targeted release date, Levine ordered the team into round-the-clock development, creating more strife in the team.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; Paul Hellquist, the game's lead designer, was often omitted from key design meetings, which he later recounted was due to his contrary nature to Levine, questioning several of his choices; he used his frustration to put into the design efforts for the Medical Pavilion level that he was in charge of at that time.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; Near the anticipated completion date, 2K decided to give Irrational another three months to polish up the game, extending the current crunch time the studio was already under.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; This left some hard-to-discover bugs and issues in the game undiscovered. One such case was an apparent [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] found in the remastered version in 2018, where under certain conditions, the player can end up looking at an object with the description "Paul Hellquist did not do his Job". Both Levine and Chris Kline, the game's lead programmer confirmed the message was a cheeky jab at Hellquist left as a debugging message; Kline and Hellquist were developing the systems to show descriptions of objects to players when looked at, and Hellquist offered to complete all the necessary descriptions in game; to jokingly help prod Hellquist along, Kline put "Paul Hellquist did not do his Job" as the default message within the executable code. While the code message was changed for the original release, the remastered version likely used a pre-final version of the ''BioShock'' code, according to Kline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/bioshock-developer-confirms-that-obscure-easter-egg-debug-message-is-real/ | title = BioShock developer confirms that obscure Easter egg debug message is real | first=  Andy | last = Chalk | date = January 9, 2018 | accessdate = January 9, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hellquist took the revelation in good humor and tweeted that other Easter eggs should have been added to the game to display, "If you are enjoying this, Paul Hellquist did his job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/01/obscure-hidden-message-in-bioshock-re-surfaces-a-decade-after-release/ |title=Obscure Hidden Message In BioShock Re-Surfaces A Decade After Release |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A critical playtest of the game occurred in January 2007, where initial feedback from the players was mostly negative, including issues of the setting being too dark, having no idea where to go, and distrusting Atlas, who at the time was voiced in a southern drawl, described as a "lecherous Colonel Sanders".&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; The team took this criticism to heart, revamping several elements during those extra months such as improving the lighting, implementing a quest marker, and using an Irish voice for Atlas to make him sound more trustworthy.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; During another late-stage playtest with the title "ninety-nine percent" complete according to Levine, the playtesters did not like the game at all as they felt no connection to the player-character Jack, and the person overseeing the tests told Levine that the game was likely to be a failure. At this point, ''BioShock'' did not have many cutscenes, as Levine was ideologically opposed to them. However, the following day, Levine and the lead group came up with a "cheap" way to correct this, by adding the initial cut scene within the plane and the subsequent plane crash, as this helped to set the time frame, place the player in the role of the character, and alluded to the "would you kindly" line later in the game.&lt;ref name="glixel sept2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/we-were-all-miserable-inside-bioshock-video-game-franchise-w439921 |title=Inside the Making of 'BioShock' Series With Creator Ken Levine |first=Chris |last=Suellentrop |date=September 14, 2016 |accessdate=September 15, 2016 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112859/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/we-were-all-miserable-inside-bioshock-video-game-franchise-w439921 |archivedate=September 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levine likened this approach to the initial aircraft crash at the onset of the television show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' to quickly establish character and setting.&lt;ref name="edge history"/&gt;

The game was successfully released in August 2007 with a final budget of about $25 million.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt; In a 2016 interview, Levine felt that the game could have used about six more months of development to improve the gun combat system and fix lagging issues that occurred during the final boss fight.&lt;ref name="glixel sept2016"/&gt; Despite the critical success of the title, many of those on the team would leave Irrational to pursue other projects due to late development strife that occurred.&lt;ref name="eurogamer truestory"/&gt;

In an interview in 2018, Levine had come to recognize that ''BioShock'' reflected several [[Jews|Jewish]] themes, though this was not intentional. Levine, who considers himself culturally Jewish but does not follow [[Judaism]], had grown up in New Jersey, but spent much of his childhood time with his father who worked in Manhattan's [[Diamond District]] and visiting his grandparents in [[Queens]], a neighborhood with a large proportion of Eastern European immigrants. Thus, Levine was exposed to much of the Jewish culture that flourished in the area following [[World War II]], and understood some of the anxiety Jewish people faced.&lt;ref name="kotaku jewish"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/bioshocks-jewish-roots-run-deep-1827482206 | title = BioShock's Jewish Roots Run Deep | first = Cody | last = Mello-Klein | date = July 10, 2018 | accessdate = July 10, 2018 | work=  [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2018 interview, Levine recognized several of the characters, including Andrew Ryan (who was inspired by Ayn Rand who was also Jewish), Sander Cohen, and Brigid Tenenbaum, were written all as Jewish, and all seeking to escape a world they felt they did not fit into by going to Rapture; Levine said "'There's literal displacement and then there's a feeling of not fitting in, of 'I don't really belong here'. I think Jews are always going to feel a little bit like they don't belong wherever they are. There's always that 'what if we have to flee' mentality."&lt;ref name="kotaku jewish"/&gt;

===Game engine===
''BioShock'' uses a heavily modified [[Unreal Engine]] 2.5 with some of the advanced technologies from Unreal Engine 3.&lt;ref name=engine&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant |first=Christopher |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/11/03/bioshock-infinite-is-to-unreal-engine-3-as-bioshock-was-to-unrea/ |title=BioShock Infinite is to Unreal Engine 3 as BioShock was to Unreal Engine 2.5 |date=November 3, 2010 |accessdate=August 23, 2011 |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |quote=Despite an aging engine under the hood, the artists at Irrational were able to make BioShock look more UE3 than UE2.5. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106052243/http://www.joystiq.com/2010/11/03/bioshock-infinite-is-to-unreal-engine-3-as-bioshock-was-to-unrea |archivedate=November 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irrational had previous experience with modifying and expanding on the Unreal Engine in ''[[SWAT 4]]'', and continued this advancement of the engine within ''BioShock''. One major improvement they added was improved water effects, given the nature of the game's setting, hiring a programmer and artist just to focus on the water effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://360.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=7461&amp;pg=3 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011171901/http://360.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=7461&amp;pg=3 | archivedate=October 11, 2007| title=E3 06: ''BioShock'' Interview Transcript | date=May 18, 2006|accessdate = May 18, 2007 | publisher = Advanced Media Network | first = Eric | last = Topf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This graphical enhancement has been lauded by critics, with [[GameSpot]] saying, "Whether it's standing water on the floor or sea water rushing in after an explosion, it will blow you away every time you see it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/bioshock/review.html |title=''Bioshock'' |date=August 21, 2007 |accessdate=August 21, 2007 |first=Jeff |last=Gerstmann |publisher=Gamespot |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011093628/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/bioshock/review.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BioShock'' also uses the [[Havok Physics]] engine that allows for an enhancement of in-game [[physics]], the integration of [[ragdoll physics]], and allows for more lifelike movement by elements of the environment.&lt;ref name="BioFAQs 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioshock-online.com/faq/#engine |title=''BioShock'' FAQs&amp;nbsp;– What engine is ''BioShock'' using? |accessdate=October 7, 2007 |date=December 30, 2006 |publisher=Through the Looking Glass |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011150416/http://bioshock-online.com/faq/ |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Windows version was built to work in both [[Direct3D|Direct3D 10 (DirectX 10)]] and DirectX 9, with the DirectX 10 version supporting additional water and particle effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/features/6177688/index.html |title=BioShock Hardware Performance Guide |first=Sarju |last=Shah |date=August 26, 2007 |accessdate=March 3, 2008 |publisher=Gamespot AU |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026023845/http://au.gamespot.com/features/6177688/index.html |archivedate=October 26, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/08/30/bioshock_gameplay_graphics_and_performance/1 |title=BioShock: Graphics &amp; Performance |date=August 30, 2007 |accessdate=March 3, 2008 |first=Tim |last=Smalley |publisher=Bit-Tech |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216102314/http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/08/30/bioshock_gameplay_graphics_and_performance/1 |archivedate=February 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/77486-bioshock-image-quality-dx9-vs-dx10 |title=''BioShock Image Quality: DX9 Vs.

===Soundtrack===
{{Main|BioShock (soundtrack)}}

''BioShock'' contains both licensed music and an original score. The licensed music from the 1940s and 1950s can be heard playing on [[phonograph]] throughout Rapture. In total, 30 licensed songs can be heard throughout the game.&lt;ref name="Hyrb"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/10/11/bioshock-music-list.aspx | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090604094249/http://majornelson.com/archive/2007/10/11/bioshock-music-list.aspx | archivedate = June 4, 2009 | title = ''BioShock'' Music list | date = October 11, 2007 | accessdate = October 12, 2007 | publisher = Major Nelson's Blog | first = Larry | last = Hyrb }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original score was composed by [[Garry Schyman]]. He works his pieces to mesh well with the chosen licensed music as to keep the same feel, while also trying to bring out something that was "eerie, frightening and at times beautiful" to mesh well with Rapture's environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Soundtrack Nation: Interviews with Today's Top Professionals in Film, Videogame, and Television Scoring, 1st Ed. | isbn = 1435457625 | publisher = Cengage Learning | year = 2010 | first = Tom | last =Hoover | section = Chapter 1: Gerry Schyman }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release and promotion===
An initial demo of the game was made available in August 2007 for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/08/12/demo-bioshock.aspx | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081011221342/http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/08/12/demo-bioshock.aspx| archivedate=October 11, 2008| title = Demo: BioShock | publisher = Major Nelson's Blog | first = Larry | last = Hyrb | date = August 12, 2007 | accessdate = November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/08/12/show-239-wma-the-one-about-the-bioshock-demo-with-ken-levine.aspx | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090204040601/http://majornelson.com/archive/2007/08/12/show-239-wma-the-one-about-the-bioshock-demo-with-ken-levine.aspx | archivedate = February 4, 2009 | title = Show #239 (WMA) The one about the BioShock demo with Ken Levine | publisher = Major Nelson's Blog | first = Larry | last = Hyrb | date = August 12, 2007 | accessdate = November 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/20/bioshock-pc-demo-is-now-available/ |title=BioShock PC demo is now available |first=Ross |last=Miller |date=August 20, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2011 |publisher=Joystiq |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715120404/http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/20/bioshock-pc-demo-is-now-available/ |archivedate=July 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This demo included cutscenes to introduce the player to Rapture, the game's tutorial section, and its first levels; the demo also included weapons, plasmids, and tonics that would otherwise be introduced later in the full title, as to give the player more of the features that would be found in the published game.&lt;ref name="bit-tech" /&gt; The Xbox demo was the fastest demo at that time to reach one million downloads on the [[Xbox Live]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xboxworld.com.au/news/bioshock-sets-new-xbox-live-marketplace-record.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121206030710/http://www.xboxworld.com.au/news/bioshock-sets-new-xbox-live-marketplace-record.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 6, 2012 |title=''bioshock'' sets new Xbox live marketplace record |publisher=Xbox World Australia |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |date=July 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The full game was released for these platforms on August 21, 2007.

The first patch for the Xbox 360 version was released about two weeks after release to fix some of the game stability issues players had reported&lt;ref name="nelsonupdate"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/09/06/bioshock-title-update.aspx | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090202145901/http://majornelson.com/archive/2007/09/06/bioshock-title-update.aspx | archivedate = February 2, 2009 | title = ''BioShock'' Title update | publisher = Major Nelson's Blog | last = Hryb | first = Larry | date=September 6, 2007 | accessdate = September 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patch was found to introduce more problems to the game for some users, including occasional freezes, bad [[framerate]]s, and audio-related issues, though methods to resolve these issues through the console's cache system were outlined by Irrational Games.&lt;ref name="updateprobs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48832 |title=BioShock X360 Update Solves, Introduces Issues (Updated) |publisher=Shacknews |first=Chris |last=Faylor |date=September 7, 2007 |accessdate=November 14, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008162426/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48832 |archivedate=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, a common patch was released for both the Xbox and Windows version. The patch included additional content such as new Plasmids, new achievements for the Xbox 360 version, and additional graphics settings to address some of the field-of-view issues identified by players. (See [[#PC technical issues and DRM|below]]).

Reviewers did highlight a few negative issues in ''BioShock'', however. The recovery system involving "Vita-Chambers", which revive a defeated player at half life, but do not alter the enemies' health, makes it possible to wear down enemies through sheer perseverance, and was criticised as one of the biggest flaws in the gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=170293 |title=''BioShock'' Review |work=Computer And Video Games |publisher=Xbox World 360 Magazine |accessdate=July 24, 2007 |date=August 16, 2007 |first=Alex |last=Dale |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315114522/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=170293 |archivedate=March 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN noted that both the controls and graphics of the Xbox 360 version are inferior to those of the PC version, in that switching between weapons or plasmids is easier using the PC's mouse than the 360's radial menu, as well as the graphics being slightly better with higher resolutions.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; The game has been touted as a hybrid [[first-person shooter]], but two reviewers found advances from comparable games lacking, both in the protagonist and in the challenges he faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/21212 | title = ''Bioshock'' review | publisher = Yale Daily News | accessdate = November 4, 2007 | date = September 7, 2007 | author = S.T.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reviewers and essayists such as [[Jonathan Blow]] also found that the "moral choice" the game offered to the player (saving or harvesting the little sisters) was flawed because it had no real impact on the game, which ultimately leads the player to think that the sisters were just mechanics of no real importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |quote=""Blow turned to ''BioShock'' as his example of flawed architecture (...) The very idea of this save or kill dilemma is an architected idea imposed from the top," he explained (...) The game rules determine the actual meaning of life in the game, and it says whatever you do to the Little Sisters doesn't matter, no matter how much the game tries to convince you that it does". The "Meta-message", according to Blow, is that "the designers of this game are trying to manipulate your emotions in a clumsy way."''

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Friedman for ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' concurred with Blow, noting that the player only loses 10% of the possible ADAM rewards for saving the Little Sisters rather than killing them, and felt that this would have been better instituted as part of the game difficulty mechanic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/9/19/12972940/bioshock-little-sisters-adam |title=BioShock bungled its best chance to make play meaningful |first=Daniel |last=Friedman |date=September 19, 2016 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921023843/http://www.polygon.com/2016/9/19/12972940/bioshock-little-sisters-adam |archivedate=September 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[LucasArts]] developer Clint Hocking wrote a noted essay that stated that ''BioShock'' exhibited "[[Ludonarrative#ludonarrative dissonance|ludonarrative dissonance]]" between its story and mechanics, as while the story advocates selflessness in helping others, its gameplay encourages selfishness by preying on Little Sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/ludonarrative-dissonance-the-roadblock-to-realism-235197.phtml |title=Ludonarrative dissonance: The roadblock to realism |first=Brett |last=Makedonski |date=September 26, 2012 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |work=[[Destructoid]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923014932/https://www.destructoid.com/ludonarrative-dissonance-the-roadblock-to-realism-235197.phtml |archivedate=September 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial Windows release was criticized by players for several perceived shortcomings. The game was shipped with [[SecuROM]] [[copy protection]] that required activation from 2K Games' servers over the Internet; the unavailability of these servers was reported as the reason for the cancellation of the game's midnight release in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6177330.html?action=convert&amp;om_clk=latestnews&amp;tag=latestnews;title;0 |title=''Bioshock'' PC Launch Shortcircuts |date=August 23, 2007 |accessdate=August 23, 2007 |first=Randolph |last=Ramsey |publisher=Gamespot |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014637/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6177330.html?action=convert&amp;om_clk=latestnews&amp;tag=latestnews%3Btitle%3B0 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Players found that the SecuROM limited the number of times the game could be activated to two; user feedback led to 2K Games to increase the activation count to five,&lt;ref name="maxconsole_user_act"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxconsole.net/archive/index.php/t-77804.html |title=2K: Tell your brother to buy his own Bioshock, you didn't buy it for the whole family |date=September 4, 2007 |publisher=maxconsole.net |accessdate=November 12, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="neoseeker_user_act"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neoseeker.com/news/story/7091/ |title=One copy of BioShock per family (member)? |publisher=Neoseeker |date=September 5, 2007 |accessdate=November 12, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907180345/http://www.neoseeker.com/news/story/7091/ |archivedate=September 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later offer a tool that allowed users to revoke previous activations on their own.&lt;ref name="revoketool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2kgames.com/bioshock/support/revoketool/ |title=2K Revocation tool download page |date=November 3, 2007 |accessdate=November 3, 2007 |publisher=Cult of Rapture |first=Elizabeth |last=Tobey |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724120803/http://www.2kgames.com/bioshock/support/revoketool |archivedate=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately 2K Games removed the activation limit, though retail versions of the game still required the activation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/53236 |title=2K Games Lifts BioShock PC Install Limit, DRM |publisher=[[Shacknews]] |first=Aaron |last=Linde |date=June 19, 2008 |accessdate=June 19, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626224630/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/53236 |archivedate=June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levine admitted that their initial approach to the activation process was malformed, harming their reputation during the launch period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/24/joystiq-interviews-bioshocks-ken-levine-about-success-and-harve/ |title=Joystiq interviews BioShock's Ken Levine about success and harvesting Little Sisters |first=Alexander |last=Sliwinski |date=August 24, 2007 |accessdate=August 29, 2014 |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007170507/http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/24/joystiq-interviews-bioshocks-ken-levine-about-success-and-harve/ |archivedate=October 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''BioShock'' has received praise for its artistic style and compelling storytelling. In their book, ''Digital Culture: Understanding New Media'', Glen Creeber and Royston Martin perform a case study of ''BioShock'' as a critical analysis of video games as an artistic medium. They praised the game for its visuals, sound, and ability to engage the player into the story. They viewed ''BioShock'' as a sign of the "coming of age" of video games as an artistic medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creeber|first=Martin|title=Digital Culture: Understanding New Media|year=2008|publisher=Open University Press|isbn=0-335-22197-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Lanchester of the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' recognized ''BioShock'' as one of the first video games to break into coverage of mainstream media to be covered as a work of art arising from its narrative aspects, whereas before video games had failed to enter into the "cultural discourse", or otherwise covered due to moral controversies they created.&lt;ref name="John 18–20"/&gt; Peter Suderman for ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' in 2016 wrote that ''BioShock'' was the first game that demonstrated that [[video games as an art form|video games could be a work of art]], particularly highlighting that the game plays on the theme of giving the illusion of individual control.&lt;ref name="vox sept2016"/&gt;

In February 2011, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] announced it would be holding an exhibit dedicated to the art of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibitions: The Art of Video Games |url=http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/ |publisher=Smithsonian American Art Museum |accessdate=February 21, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110015838/http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/ |archivedate=January 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several games were chosen initially and the public could vote for which games they felt deserved to be displayed via a poll on the exhibit's website. ''BioShock'' was considered a front runner to be displayed because of its status as a game that demonstrated how artistic the medium can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Rus |title=Smithsonian ends games-as-art debate |url=http://www.bitmob.com/articles/smithsonian-ends-games-as-art-debate |publisher=BitMob |accessdate=February 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221093130/http://bitmob.com/articles/smithsonian-ends-games-as-art-debate |archivedate=February 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Would you kindly}}
The game's plot twist, where the player discovers that the player-character Jack has been coerced into events by the trigger phrase, "Would you kindly...", is considered one of the strongest narrative elements of recent games, in part that it subverted the expectation that the player has control and influence on the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/exqb7p/would-you-kindly-read-this-article-on-gamings-greatest-plot-twist-915 | title = Would You Kindly Read This Article on Gaming's Greatest Plot Twist? | first = Mike | last =Diver |date = February 23, 2015 | accessdate = October 18, 2017 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://games.avclub.com/choosing-the-impossible-did-bioshock-define-the-last-1-1798346366 | title = Choosing the impossible: Did BioShock define the last 10 years of video games? | authors = Matt Gerardi, Sam Barsanti, William Hughes, and Clayton Purdom | date = August 21, 2017 | accessdate = October 18, 2017 | work = [[The A.V.

In response to the game's high sales and critical acclaim, Take-Two Interactive chairman Strauss Zelnick revealed in a conference call to analysts that the company now considered the game as part of a franchise.&lt;ref name="thorsen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6178502.html |title=''BioShock'' ships 1.5M, sequels being discussed |date=September 10, 2007 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |first=Tor |last=Thorsen |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016095730/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6178502.html |archivedate=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also speculated on any follow-ups mimicking the development cycle of ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', with a new release expected every two to three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bit-tech.net/news/2007/09/11/bioshock_sequel_coming_1_5m_copies_shipped/1 |title=''BioShock'' sequel coming, 1.5&amp;nbsp;m copies shipped |accessdate=October 7, 2007 |first=Tim |last=Smalley |date=September 11, 2007 |publisher=Bit-Tech |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011132006/http://www.bit-tech.net/news/2007/09/11/bioshock_sequel_coming_1_5m_copies_shipped/1 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/levine-talks-bioshocks-checkered-launch |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120907103705/http://www.next-gen.biz/features/levine-talks-bioshocks-checkered-launch |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 7, 2012 |title=Levine Talks BioShock's Checkered Launch |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |date=August 24, 2007 |publisher=Next Generation |first=Joe |last=Keiser }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2K's president Christoph Hartmann stated that ''BioShock'' could have five sequels, comparing the franchise to the ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/56633 |title=BioShock Could Have Five Sequels, Suggests 2K |first=Chris |last=Faylor |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=January 7, 2009 |publisher=[[Shacknews]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204054758/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/56633 |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''BioShock 2'' was announced in 2008, with its development being led by [[2K Marin]]. Levine stated that Irrational (then 2K Boston) was not involved in the game's sequel because they wanted to "swing for the fences" and try to come up with something "very, very different", which was later revealed as ''BioShock Infinite''.&lt;ref name="Interview: Ken Levine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/ken-levine-part-one |title=Interview: Ken Levine – Part One |publisher=GamesIndustry.biz |date=August 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2008 |first=Phil |last=Elliott |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808053320/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/ken-levine-part-one |archivedate=August 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BioShock 3'' was also announced, with its release assumed to likely coincide with the ''BioShock'' film.&lt;ref name="Bioshock 3 Announced"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/879/879727p1.html |title=BioShock 3 Announced |publisher=IGN |date=June 5, 2008 |accessdate=June 5, 2008 |first=Ryan |last=Geddes |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607135953/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/879/879727p1.html |archivedate=June 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BioShock 2'' takes place about ten years following the events of the first game. The player assumes the role of Subject Delta, a precursor of the Big Daddies who must search the fallen city of Rapture for his former Little Sister, Eleanor. ''BioShock 2'' was released for Windows PC, Mac, Xbox 360, and the PlayStation 3 worldwide on February 9, 2010.

While ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'', developed by Irrational Games and released in 2013, shares the name and many similar gameplay concepts with ''BioShock'', the title is not a sequel or prequel in story, instead taking place aboard the collapsing [[Floating cities and islands in fiction|air-city]] of Columbia in the year 1912, and following former [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agent Booker DeWitt as he tries to rescue a woman named Elizabeth from the dystopia it has become.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/08/bioshock-infinite/ |title=First Look: BioShock Infinite Satirizes American Imperialism, in the Sky |first=Olivia |last=Koski |date=August 12, 2010 |accessdate=September 23, 2011 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821114854/http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/08/bioshock-infinite/ |archivedate=August 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Infinite'' involves the possibilities of multiple universes, and one scene during the game take place at the lighthouse and bathysphere terminus of Rapture as part of this exploration, though any direct canonical connection is not given in the main game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/03/27/an-attempt-to-understand-bioshock-infinites-brilliant-and-bizarre-ending |title=An Attempt to Understand BioShock Infinite's Brilliant and Bizarre Ending |first=Paul |last=Tassi |date=March 27, 2013 |accessdate=March 28, 2013 |work=[[Forbes]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130406095100/http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/03/27/an-attempt-to-understand-bioshock-infinites-brilliant-and-bizarre-ending/ |archivedate=April 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episodic expansion, ''[[BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea|Burial at Sea]]'', takes place in Rapture in 1959, prior to the war between Atlas and Ryan, while continuing the story of Booker and Elizabeth.

After completing ''BioShock Infinite'' and its expansion, Levine announced that he was restructuring Irrational Games to focus on smaller, narrative-driven titles. 2K Games continues to hold on to the ''BioShock'' intellectual property and plans to continue to develop games in this series, considering the framework set by Levine and his team as a "rich creative canvas" for more stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-universe-a-rich-creative-canvas-for-many-new-stories/1100-6417894/ |title=BioShock universe a "rich creative canvas" for many new stories |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=February 21, 2014 |accessdate=August 29, 2014 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404130354/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-universe-a-rich-creative-canvas-for-many-new-stories/1100-6417894/ |archivedate=April 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry rumors after the game's release suggested a film adaptation of the game would be made, utilizing similar [[green screen]] filming techniques as in the movie ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' to recreate the environments of Rapture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/01/08/rumor-bioshock-movie-murmurs-in-hollywood/ |title=Rumor: BioShock movie murmurs in Hollywood |publisher=Joystiq |first=Ludwig |last=Keitzmann |date=January 8, 2008 |accessdate=January 10, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109132945/http://www.joystiq.com/2008/01/08/rumor-bioshock-movie-murmurs-in-hollywood/ |archivedate=January 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 2008, Take-Two Interactive announced a deal with [[Universal Studios]] to produce a ''BioShock'' movie, to be directed by [[Gore Verbinski]] and written by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117985365.html?categoryId=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Gore Verbinski to direct 'Bioshock' |date=May 9, 2008 |accessdate=May 9, 2008 |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Michael |last=Flemming |first2=Ben |last2=Fritz |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509153832/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117985365.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was expected to be released in 2010, but was put on hold due to budget concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002851.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2854 |title=Universal halts Verbinski's 'Bioshock' |date=April 24, 2009 |accessdate=April 29, 2009 |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Michael |last=Fleming |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429082758/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002851.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2854 |archivedate=April 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 24, 2009 it was revealed that Verbinski had dropped out of the project due to the studio's decision to film overseas to keep the budget under control. Verbinski reportedly feels this would have hindered his work on ''[[Rango (2011 film)|Rango]]''. Then [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]] was in talks to direct with Verbinski as producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007622.html?categoryId=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Universal picks 'Bioshock' helmer |publisher=Variety |first=Michael |last=Flemming |date=August 23, 2009 |accessdate=August 23, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827103827/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007622.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |archivedate=August 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010 the project was in pre-production stage, with director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and Braden Lynch, a voice artist from ''[[BioShock 2]]'' both working on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradenlynch.com/Home.html |title=Bioshock film status |date=January 1, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708090448/http://www.bradenlynch.com/Home.html |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By July the film was facing budget issues but producer Gore Verbinski said they were working it out.

Levine confirmed in March 2013 that the film has been officially cancelled. Levine stated that after Warner's ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' film in 2009 did not do as well as the studio expected, they had concerns with the $200 million budget that Verbinski had for the ''BioShock'' film. They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $80 million budget, but Verbinski did not want to accept this.&lt;ref name="eurogamer film"/&gt; In February 2017, Verbinski said that his crew were about eight weeks from starting filming,&lt;ref name="ign film 8 weeks"/&gt; with plans for many elaborate sets given that the setting of Rapture could not be something easily shot on existing locations, requiring the $200 million budget. Verbinski was anticipating on releasing the film with an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rating]], when Universal approached him about changing the film's direction. Universal requested that he tone down the film and aim instead for a PG-13 movie, which would be able to draw more audiences to the film and recoup the larger budget he asked for. Verbinski insisted on keeping the R-rating, and refused the smaller budget Universal offered to make the R-rated version. Universal felt that that expensive a film with the limited R-rating would be too much of a risk, and pulled him from the film.&lt;ref name="film ama"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/16/14635490/bioshock-director-deadpool |title=BioShock film could have been made today, director says |first=Julia |last=Alexander |date=February 16, 2017 |accessdate=February 16, 2017 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216202222/http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/16/14635490/bioshock-director-deadpool |archivedate=February 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Universal then subsequently brought in a new director to work with the smaller budget, but Levine and 2K Games did not feel that the new director was a good fit with the material. Universal then let Levine make the decision to end the project, which he did believing that the film would not work with the current set of compromises they would have had to make.&lt;ref name="eurogamer film"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-12-ken-levine-personally-killed-off-the-bioshock-film-heres-why |title=Ken Levine personally killed off the BioShock film – here's why |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=March 12, 2013 |accessdate=March 12, 2013 |first=Martin |last=Robinson |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315091122/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-12-ken-levine-personally-killed-off-the-bioshock-film-heres-why |archivedate=March 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, artwork from the canceled film surfaced online, showing what an adaptation could have looked like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/return-rapture-concept-art-cancelled-bioshock-film/ |title=Return To Rapture With This Concept Art For The Cancelled BioShock Film |date=January 14, 2014 |publisher= |accessdate=July 19, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708040721/http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/return-rapture-concept-art-cancelled-bioshock-film/ |archivedate=July 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Verbinski said that there is "all kinds of crazy stuff" from the pre-production stage that still exists such as screen tests for characters.&lt;ref name="ign film 8 weeks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/27/bioshock-movie-was-literally-8-weeks-from-shooting |title=Bioshock Movie Was "Literally 8 Weeks" From Shooting |first=Joe |last=Skrebels |date=February 27, 2017 |accessdate=February 27, 2017 |work=[[IGN]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227171511/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/27/bioshock-movie-was-literally-8-weeks-from-shooting |archivedate=February 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted in the 2017 Reddit piece that with the success of the 2016 film ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', he believes that there is now justification for his vision of the ''BioShock'' film.&lt;ref name="film ama"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27777">'''Blaster''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s in the [[Transformers]] [[Transformers series#The Transformers|television]] and [[Transformers (comics)|comic]] series based on the popular toy line produced by [[Takara Tomy]] and [[Hasbro]]. Due to trademark reasons, he is sometimes called '''Autobot Blaster'''. He is an [[Autobot]] who specializes in communications.

Blaster's initial transformation is an AM/FM Stereo Cassette Player, commonly referred to as a [[boombox]] or ''ghettoblaster'', hence the name. Blaster was a popular character from the original series while not featuring as prominently in the modern [[Transformers]] universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Unofficial Guide to Transformers 1980s Through 1990s | edition = Revised &amp; Expanded 2nd | last=Alvarez | first=J.E. | year=2001 | publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd.| ISBN=0-7643-1364-9 | page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the Autobot communications sub-group Blaster frequently worked with its other members – [[Eject (Transformers)|Eject]], [[Grandslam (Transformers)|Grand Slam]], [[Raindance (Transformers)|Raindance]], [[Ramhorn]], [[Rewind (Transformers)|Rewind]] and [[Steeljaw]]. He is the Autobots' answer to the evil Decepticon [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]].

Blaster ('''Tempo''' in [[France]], '''Radiorobot''' in [[Italy]], '''Broadcast''' in [[Japan]]), like the Autobot [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]], has a great love of Earth culture, [[rock music]] and other forms of music as long as it is hard. He's normally at the forefront of any given situation. As an AM/FM stereo cassette player, he can perform as a deck, plus receive radio signals on a variety of frequencies. Acting as the Autobot communications center, he can transmit signals within a 4,000 mile radius. Blaster is sometimes depicted as carrying various tape warriors within his deck, including ([[Steeljaw]], [[Ramhorn]], [[Rewind (Transformers)|Rewind]] and [[Eject (Transformers)|Eject]]).

===Reception===
According to Dan Fleming in Powerplay: toys as popular culture, Blaster represents a guardian of more primitive heroes, as well as the hidden power of technology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U3u7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=blaster+transformers&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-GeFTK2zH9Pcngfj5b34AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=blaster%20transformers&amp;f=false Powerplay: toys as popular culture By Dan Fleming]&lt;/ref&gt;

Blaster was voted the 5th top Transformer who was “bad ass” in the comics by Topless Robots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toplessrobot.com/2009/04/10_transformers_that_were_only_badass_in_the_comic.php 10 Transformers That Were Only Badass in the Comics By Rob Bricken, Apr. 14 2009 By Kevin J. Guhl]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critics, Blaster has a "black coded" voice and name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b6Iqh5umo3sC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=blaster+transformers&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vmmFTIKJLc7Mngf29_TVAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=gobots&amp;f=false Saturday morning censors: television regulation before the V-chip By Heather Hendershot]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animated series===
Blaster's first appearance was in episode 20, "Dinobot Island, Part 1" with no particular origin, simply appearing among the Autobots. Blaster frequently spoke in rhyme resembling [[rap music]] lyrics.

He had several important appearances in season 2, most notably in "Blaster Blues", when Spike and Carly brought Blaster to a concert because he loved music. Blaster decided to share his music by transmitting the show to the other Autobots but drove everyone but Cosmos and Jazz, who liked his taste in music, crazy also because the music was so loud they were unable to respond to a Decepticon attack as they got away with stealing a powerful decoder. Blaster and [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]] went looking for the Decepticon in space then as luck would have it they found something on the moon which turned out to be a Decepticon hideout. Blaster and Cosmos listen in on their plans to conquer the Earth but they ended up getting captured by [[Astrotrain]] when they got discovered by [[Megatron]]. After they got captured, Megatron decided to use Blaster as a transcrambler with Cosmos being used as a power booster for their device which could foul up Earth commutation systems. Blaster, who wanted to stop Megatron's plan and to redeem himself from before, tipped the other Autobots the Decepticons location by transmitting his music when Megatron ransomed the humans into giving all their energy reverses. Blaster ejected some feedback to overload the Decpeticons machine with Cosmos offering a power boast to destroy it, after Megatron and Astrotrain left base to confront Omega Supreme, Powerglide, Optimus Prime, Spike and Carly when they arrived to stop them and to rescue their friends, which stop their plans.

In the episode "Prime Target", the big game hunter [[Lord Chumley]] captures a secret [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] jet, leading to panic and the possibility of war. Chumley then set his sights on the ultimate trophy, the head of [[Optimus Prime (Transformers)|Optimus Prime]]. In order to lure Optimus in, Chumley captures the Autobots [[Tracks (Transformers)|Tracks]], [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]], [[Beachcomber (Transformers)|Beachcomber]], [[Grapple (Transformers)|Grapple]], Blaster and [[Inferno (Transformers)|Inferno]]. [[Windcharger]] and [[Huffer (Transformers)|Huffer]] are able to avoid being trapped. When [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]] learns of the location Chumley was keeping the captured Autobots, Optimus Prime accepts Chumley's challenge to meet him alone. Although interrupted by the Decepticons Astrotrain and [[Blitzwing]]'s attempt to ally the Decepticons with Chumley, Optimus defeats the big game hunter and frees the Autobots. Chumley and the stolen jet were handed over to the Soviets by the Autobots as punishment for his actions.

He also had a prominent role in "Auto-Bop". In the episode, Blaster and Tracks encounter Raoul, someone who Tracks has encountered before. Raoul and the posse, the Bop Crew, were finding something suspicious about a nightclub called the Dancitron. As the two Autobots investigate, they find a scheme plotted by the Decepticons [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] and [[Starscream]]. Later, while Tracks in his Cybertronian shuttle craft mode chases Starscream in an aerial battle, Blaster faces off with his Decepticon counterpart Soundwave in a sonic duel, resulting in a rivalry between the two.

In ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', set in the year 2005, Blaster was assigned to [[Autobot City]] on Earth. During the invasion by Megatron's forces, Blaster was responsible for sending a distress signal to Optimus Prime on Moonbase One. Upon Megatron's orders, Soundwave releases [[Rumble (Transformers)|Rumble]], [[Frenzy (Transformers)|Frenzy]], [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]], and [[Ratbat]] to jam the transmission to prevent him from establishing contact with the Autobot Moonbase. After Blaster's broadcasting message was interrupted and blocked, Soundwave's cassette minions attack the communications tower. For the first time we also see Blaster's own cassettes, [[Eject (Transformers)|Eject]], [[Rewind (Transformers)|Rewind]], [[Ramhorn]], and [[Steeljaw]]. The signal is received and Optimus Prime is able to arrive with reinforcements to defeat the Decepticons. After the attack, Blaster picked up transmissions from Moonbases One and Two. He was not seen for the rest of the film.

In episode 78, ''Madman's Paradise'', Spike Witwicky and his wife Carly host a banquet for a visiting ambassador. Their son Daniel gets bored and wandered off. [[Grimlock]] follows him, and they fall into a lost chamber where [[Quintessons]] banished their criminals to other dimensions. They slipped through to the sorcerous other-dimensional realm of Menonia, and are tricked into fighting on the [[Red Wizard (Transformers)|Red Wizard]]'s side, only to find out that he is the Quintesson criminal, who overthrew the [[Golden One]]. Blaster, [[Ultra Magnus]], [[Eject (Transformers)|Eject]], [[Rewind (Transformers)|Rewind]], [[Ramhorn]], and [[Steeljaw]] follow, and using Blaster's amplification, they help the Golden One defeat the Red Wizard. With the help of [[Perceptor]], the Autobots and Daniel are returned to [[Cybertron]].

He continued to appear throughout the season 3. His last appearance in the U.S. cartoon was in episode 95, "The Return of Optimus Prime, Part 2".

Blaster is destroyed in the Japanese ''[[The Transformers: Headmasters]]'' series during a fight with [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] (who also perished in the fight) and rebuilt two episodes later as [[Twincast]], with a blue/white color scheme as opposed to the red/yellow previously. After a pivotal role in ''Operation Cassette'', he featured as a regular character throughout the whole series. The Twincast toy was recently re-issued by eHobby. Aside from the blue/yellow color scheme, the Twincast toy also differs from the Blaster/Broadcast toy in that the tape compartment can hold two cassette Transformers simultaneously.

===Comics===

====Dreamwave Productions====
Blaster was among the Autobot resistance during the ''Age of Interment'', shown in the third ''War Within'' series.

In the second Generation 1 miniseries from [[Dreamwave Productions]], Blaster is part of a resistance group led by [[Hot Rod (Transformers)|Hot Rod]]. He accompanies [[Optimus Prime (Transformers)|Optimus Prime]] during his attack on Iacon.

====IDW Publishing====
Blaster was recently the subject of a ''[[The Transformers: Spotlight|Spotlight]]'' issue in 2008. The comic depicts Blaster as "The Voice", acting much like a radio DJ and bolstering Autobot morale in the war against the Decepticons. In the comic, Blaster's alternate form is a tank with a pair of large sonic cannons.

In “Spotlight: Blaster”, Blaster was badly damaged and left adrift in space, but was discovered by an alien ship who bought him back to the [[Autobot Command Hub]] under the command of [[Silverbolt]]. Having little memory of the event himself, Blaster finds that he was betrayed and nearly killed by a fellow Autobot just before his regular broadcast, in order to demoralize the Autobots just before a Decepticon attack. When the assassin tries again, Blaster eventually finds out that his attacker was [[Beachcomber (Transformers)|Beachcomber]], who was being controlled by the Decepticon [[Bombshell (Transformers)|Bombshell]] at the behest of [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]]. Blaster manages to talk Beachcomber into resisting the control, which nearly burns out his mind. Blaster swears to get revenge on Soundwave.

====Marvel Comics====
In the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] Transformers comics Blaster originally appeared in issue #17, attempting to rescue his friend Scrounge, who was to be executed by [[Straxus]]. Blaster is captured himself and forced to watch his friend die. He is rescued by [[Perceptor]] and his Autobot group. Later, spying on Straxus' use of the Space Bridge, the Autobots decide to attack and blow it up. They discover the Space Bridge is their comrade Spanner. Blaster then battles Straxus one-on-one, seemingly destroying him. With the Space Bridge blowing itself up, Blaster has no choice but to lead his comrades ([[Beachcomber (Transformers)|Beachcomber]], [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]], [[Perceptor]], [[Powerglide (Transformers)|Powerglide]], [[Seaspray (Transformers)|Seaspray]] and [[Warpath (Transformers)|Warpath]]) across the Bridge to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;The Official Overstreet Comic Book Companion, 11th Edition, Page 257 by Robert M. Overstreet, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Circuitbreaker-autobots.jpg|left|thumb|Circuit Breaker leads a giant Autobot she created from parts of other Autobots against the Decepticon Battlechargers in Marvel's Transformers comics.]]
Their luck didn't improve as they were attacked by [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] and his troops on arrival, only being saved when Megatron decides to attack the Autobot bases instead. [[Circuit Breaker (Transformers)|Circuit Breaker]], a super-powered human whose crippling in an attack by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] had left her with a pathological hatred of all Transformers, then attacks and defeated them. She mounts their heads in her [[Rapid Anti-Robot Attack Team]] headquarters. After capturing the [[Aerialbot]]s as well a new problem arose. The Decepticon Battlechargers [[Runabout (Transformers)|Runabout]] and [[Runamuck (Transformers)|Runamuck]] had been causing mayhem all across America. Using the parts from all the captured Autobots she creates a giant Autobot with herself in control, striking a deal with them that if they would co-operate she would let them go. Circuit Breaker then uses them to oppose the two Decepticons, who were attacking the [[Statue of Liberty]]. After defeating the Decepticons with Circuit Breaker the Autobots were released and rebuilt into their original forms.

After a brief side adventure in the UK comics, in which Blaster's group are attacked (and almost killed) by the insane future Decepticon [[Galvatron]], Blaster and his men join up with the main Autobots on Earth. Soon after they join, [[Optimus Prime (Transformers)|Optimus Prime]] dies. Blaster delivers the eulogy at his funeral.

In issue #27, "King of the Hill!", Perceptor summons his fellow Autobots Blaster, [[Hot Spot (Transformers)|Hot Spot]], [[Jetfire]], [[Omega Supreme]], [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] and [[Silverbolt]] in order to decide who should take leadership of the Autobots. After an attack by the giant Decepticon [[Trypticon]], [[Grimlock]] is chosen to lead them.

Blaster would soon regret this. After a mission where their cover had been blown by ''the Mechanic'', a human, he and [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Goldbug]], appalled by Grimlock's willingness to sacrifice humans to achieve their goals, desert. They also ran because they fear Grimlock's anger.

They had more adventures; facing the Decepticon [[Triple Changer]]s and a plague of Scraplets, as well as facing off with a Decepticon strike force sent to destroy Galvatron and [[Ultra Magnus]]. Blaster (himself getting more callous) is robbed of his ally when Goldbug and the [[Throttlebot]]s are betrayed by humans and captured by RAAT. He is subsequently attacked by both the [[Combaticons]] and the [[Protectobot]]s, who had been sent by Grimlock to arrest him. The two combiner teams battled, with Bruticus beating Defensor. With aid from some human children Blaster takes out the giant Decepticon. As a reward, he locks Blast Off into his Decepticon shuttle mode and took them into space. There, they are attacked by Grimlock and [[Ark (Transformers)|the Ark]]. Surrendering to save their lives, Blaster discovers he was not alone in his discontent, especially after Grimlock had tried to have the kids executed.

Events came to a head when [[Fortress Maximus]]'s group of Autobots link up with Grimlock's group, informing him that many of their group's number had been empowered by linking themselves with humans via the [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmaster]] and [[Targetmaster]] processes. Grimlock is not pleased, and it was quickly realized he had to be defeated. A recently rebuilt and imprisoned Goldbug convinces Blaster to fight in Maximus' place. In the midst of their duel, [[Ratbat]]'s Decepticons attacked, and the two put aside their differences to lead the Autobots to a partial victory. During the conflict, Maximus sent a unit of his troops back to [[Nebulos]] so that Prime will be resurrected via the [[Powermaster]] process. Prime soon returns and retakes command, sending Blaster to investigate the Decepticon island resort Club Con, seemingly run by Buster Witwicky. Accompanying Buster's girlfriend Jessie, he soon had his cover blown by the [[Seacons]] and was forced to flee.

''Blaster encounters time-traveling Autobots who intended to deal with Galvatron, a plot detailed in the UK comics. This encounter results in Blaster being displaced to an alternate limbo realm.''

He is soon freed, only to be deactivated by the [[Underbase]] powered [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]].

Blaster was seen among the Autobots being repaired on the Ark when Optimus Prime sent Landmine and Cloudburst on their mission to obtain computer chips to repair fellow Autobots in issue #52, "Guess Who The Mechannibals Are Having For Dinner?".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seibertron.com/comics/view.php?comic_id=54 Seibertron.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Transformers" #52 (May 1st, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite rescuing Sky Lynx, the two Autobots' mission ended in failure, when the pair realized the Mechannibals came by their computer chips by recycling them from other robots they ate.

Blaster's body was seen among the deactivated Autobots Ratchet is doing his best to revive in Transformers #56, "Back from the Dead".

This was not the end for Blaster; he is one of the Autobots revived by [[Nucleon (Transformers)|Nucleon]] by Grimlock and the other [[Dinobots]]. Returning to Cybertron, he battles against the coming of [[Unicron]]. After the betrayal of the Decepticons, the Autobots follow them to the planet [[List of Transformers planets#Klo|Klo]], where they were ambushed. Blaster is one of the few survivors. Then he is badly damaged by [[Quake (Transformers)|Quake]]'s tank mode while [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] berates Grimlock for inept strategy. He still makes the final battle along with Grimlock, Prowl and a few others. He was present when Optimus Prime returned with the [[Last Autobot]] and routed the Decepticon forces.

The future Blaster from the Movie continuity would also appear in the UK comics, as one of the crew of Autobot city. [[Arcee]]'s unintentional dereliction of duty allows a [[Quintessons|Quintesson]] sneak attack to catch the city unawares, and Blaster appears to get killed trying to radio for help. His body was later strung up by the Quintessons as a taunting gesture to the other Autobots. However, he helps his comrades from "beyond the grave", allowing his cassettes Steeljaw, Eject and Ramhorn to assist in taking back the city.

''It later transpires that depictions of Blaster's "death" had been greatly exaggerated; he shows up, alive and well, in the prologue to the ''Time Wars'' saga, set months after the Quintesson attack on Autobot City.''

The '''Deutscher Computerspielpreis''' (German computer games award) is awarded annually by the ''Bundesverband Interaktive Unterhaltungssoftware'' (federal association for interactive entertainment software), ''G.A.M.E. Bundesverband der Entwickler von Computerspielen'' (federal association of computer game developers) and Federal Minister of Transport and Digital Infrastructure [[Alexander Dobrindt]], starting in 2009.

== Description ==

The Deutscher Computerspielpreis (The German Video Game Awards) was first awarded in 2009. The venue for the German Video Game Awards ceremony alternates annually between Munich and Berlin. The German Video Game Awards are presented by the [[Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure]] and the BIU (German Trade Association of Interactive Entertainment Software) and GAME (German Games Industry Association) trade associations, with the support of the Digital Gaming Culture Foundation. The prize money is donated by those supporters and amounts to a total of €385.000. The German Video Game Awards are the most prestigious games award within Germany. Awarded are games of “cultural and pedagogical value”, technical or gameplay-related innovations or games of high entertainment value.  Prize money is only disbursed to winners in national categories. Basic condition to submit a game in one of the donated categories is a development quota of 80 percent of the game in Germany.

Regarding the year 2015, the award has been fundamentally reshaped by the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure and the BIU (German Trade Association of Interactive Entertainment Software) and GAME (German Games Industry Association) trade associations, with the support of the Digital Gaming Culture Foundation. Besides the introduction of new and the re-structuring of existing categories, criteria for registration have been reformulated. The award currently consists of 14 categories with the latest additions of an audience award category and three international award categories, albeit those four categories are exempt from donation. Regarding criteria, pleasure as part of the gaming experience has been included and the overall catalog of criteria has been refocused.   Part of the decision was also the restaffing of juries and increase of prize money up to €450.000 in 2017.

The German Video Game Awards are announced (tendered) jointly by politicians and industry and were created by the German Government following an initiative of the German Bundestag (German Parliament) in cooperation with  BIU (German Trade Association of Interactive Entertainment Software) and GAME (German Games Industry Association) trade associations. 
Documents concerning the origin of the award are the Report of BKM to the German Bundestag dated 24. October 2007 (federal printed matter: BT-Drs. 16/7081) and the resolution of the German Bundestag dating 21. February 2008 following a proposal of the grand coalition of the SPD Party and the CDU Party (printed matter: BT-Drs. 16/7116). Background of the initiative was the perceived change of importance within society regardless of age, sex and social background of gamers and the increase of games industry as an economy of scale, as well as the extended application of games and game technology in other sectors of economy. 
Until 2014 the Kulturstaatsministerium (State Ministry of Culture) was the political Partner complementary to BIU and GAME as the economical partners of the German Video Game Awards. In 2014 the Ministry of Transport and digital Infrastructure adopted the role of the political partner.

Primary purpose is the promotion of the German games industry. Especially the development of innovative cultural and pedagogical valuable games is emphasized. Complementing its role as an advancement award, the German Video Game Awards  also award donated prizes to game concepts from students and pupils within a particular category “Best young concept” and therefore support non-professionals financially to realize their ideas for video games.

The '''Dragon Awards''' are fan-voted awards that "recognize outstanding achievement in science fiction and fantasy literature, comics, gaming and filmed entertainment". They are given out annually at [[Dragon Con]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] since 2016.&lt;ref name="dragon-awards-20160331"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Dragon Con|title=The Dragon Awards|url=http://awards.dragoncon.org/2016/03/31/the-dragon-awards/|date=March 31, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award process consists of two steps: a nomination step where each voter nominates one work of choice in each category, and a voting step where the finalists selected from the nominated works are voted on by each voter. The nominations and votes are collected electronically. Participation is available to everyone, requiring no membership or other fees to vote.&lt;ref name="dragon-awards-pr-20160404"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Official Press Release|publisher=Dragon Con|url=http://awards.dragoncon.org/2016/04/04/official-press-release/|date=April 4, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The finalist [[shortlist]] for the first Dragon Awards was announced on August 11, 2016,&lt;ref name="dragon-awards-shortlist-20160811"&gt;{{cite web|title=The #DragonAward voting is up and running!|website=Facebook|publisher=Dragon Con|url=https://www.facebook.com/DragonConOfficial/photos/a.119223318805.101787.58381388805/10153806308098806/?type=3&amp;theater|date=August 11, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the winners were announced on September 4.&lt;ref name="dragon-awards-winners-20160829"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Dragon Awards Presentation|publisher=Dragon Con|url=http://awards.dragoncon.org/2016/08/29/the-dragon-awards-presentation/|date=August 29, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909074505/http://awards.dragoncon.org/2016/08/29/the-dragon-awards-presentation/|archivedate=September 9, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dragon-awards-winners-20160904"&gt;{{cite web|title=Winners - The Dragon Award|publisher=Dragon Con|url=http://awards.dragoncon.org/winners/|date=September 4, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016|archivedate=September 6, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6tGhdM3nq?url=http://awards.dragoncon.org/winners/|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Controversy''':
The Dragon Awards have been criticized in Science-Fiction and fantasy fandom because of the appearance that the awards were created in conjunction with campaigns by the Rabid and [[Sad Puppies]] to attack the [[Hugo Award]], giving the impression that Dragon Con as a convention is itself aligned with these campaigns. &lt;ref&gt;http://corabuhlert.com/2016/09/06/the-2016-dragon-awards-or-participation-trophies-for-puppies/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics, such as bloggers "Camestros Felapton", Mike Glyer of File 770, and their commenters,&lt;ref&gt;http://file770.com/2018-dragon-awards-ballot/comment-page-1/&lt;/ref&gt; have noted that the Dragon Awards process is not transparent, but "opaque".&lt;ref&gt;https://camestrosfelapton.wordpress.com/category/dragon-awards/&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Dragon Awards process, "The Dragon Awards reserves the right to invalidate suspect or questionable ballots without notice." Language describing the review of nominations does not state that nominations are counted numerically but are "gathered and reviewed to create a final ballot."&lt;ref&gt;http://awards.dragoncon.org/faq/fan-faq/&lt;/ref&gt; Neither counts of nominations nor votes have ever been made public. The system for voting is done by email and unprotected Survey Monkey, and is easily subject to mass voting campaigns, whether by self-promoting authors, or by organized political groups. In its first year, the Dragon Awards lined up with the slate promoted by [[Vox_Day|Vox Day]]&lt;ref&gt;https://camestrosfelapton.wordpress.com/2016/09/08/the-obligatory-dragon-awards-post/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, nominated authors, Allison Littlewood, [[John Scalzi]], and [[N.K. Jemisin]]  asked Dragon Con to remove their names from the ballot. John Scalzi then reconsidered and kept his name on the ballot. The Dragon Awards initially refused to remove authors names, and received criticism across blogs and Science-Fiction related publications. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jimchines.com/2017/08/dragon-awards/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16118054/john-scalzi-alison-littlewood-dragon-awards-controversy-sci-fi-horror&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://nkjemisin.com/2017/08/withdrawing-from-the-dragon-awards/&lt;/ref&gt;


There are currently fifteen categories for the awards.

'''''East India Company''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] video game developed by [[Finland|Finnish]] company [[Nitro Games]] and published by [[Paradox Interactive]].&lt;ref name=prEIC&gt;{{Cite web| title = EIC press release| url=http://www.eic-game.com/content/press/20032009_paradox.html| accessdate = 2009-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prP&gt;{{Cite web| title = Paradox Interactive press release| url = http://www.paradoxplaza.com//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=505&amp;Itemid=129| accessdate = 2009-03-20| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327200953/http://www.paradoxplaza.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=505&amp;Itemid=129| archivedate = 2009-03-27| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on July 31, 2009 in North America and on August 14, 2009 in Europe.

The game is based on the history of European conquest of [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] by means of their [[East India Company (disambiguation)|East India Companies]]. In the game, the player takes on the role of the Governor Director of the [[East Indies]]. The task is to conquer [[India]] and establish a trade [[empire]] to rule over all others.

The game features real-time naval combat when enemy ships engage the player's fleets, and real-time land combat when the enemy tries to invade one of the player's colonies. East India Company combines trading, naval warfare, and management. Players can create a fleet to conquer the enemy with powerful warships and [[privateer]]s.

== Gameplay ==
There are eight playable nations to choose from: [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[France]], [[The Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[Spain]]. Tasks may be given by the company or the crown to do various missions including diplomacy, war, and trade. The game is mainly based in the [[Indian Subcontinent]].

There are 11 ship types in the game, including the [[schooner]], [[sloop]], [[brig]], [[East Indiaman]], [[frigate]], and [[ship of the line]].

== Development ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
A Designer's Cut was made available for download on October 27, 2009. It offers several additional features.

== Reception ==
The game was met with mixed reviews, with an average of 67% on [[Metacritic]]. IGN said that "players who are interested in the concept or the period will definitely find a worthwhile game here, but the appeal wears thin long before it should have".&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/100/1009404p1.html IGN&lt;/ref&gt; IT Reviews agreed, stating that the game was "a fun short-term challenge, just lacking the depth of play to ensure a lengthy shelf life".&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;http://www.itreviews.co.uk/games/g608.htm IT Reviews&lt;/ref&gt; [[Total PC Gaming]] magazine called it "an enjoyable trading and strategy experience, let down by lacklustre combat" (Issue 23).

'''''Fables for Robots''''' ({{lang-pl|Bajki Robotów}}) is a series of humorous [[science fiction]] short stories by Polish writer [[Stanisław Lem]], first printed in 1964.

The fables are written in the grotesque form of folk [[fairy tale]]s, set in the universe populated by [[robot]]s. In this universe there are robot kings, robot peasants, robot knights, robot scientists; a robot [[damsel in distress]] is pestered by a robot dragon, robot dogs have robot fleas, etc.&lt;ref&gt;An introduction to the 1992 edition of the ''Mortal Engines''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Fables'' constituted the bulk of the collection '''''Mortal Engines''''' ({{ISBN|0156621614}}) translated by [[Michael Kandel]]. Two of them were also published in ''The Cosmic Carnival of Stanislaw Lem''.

==Stories==
In  1965 three of the fables, "Jak ocalał świat" ("How the World Survived"), "Maszyna Trurla" ("Trurl's Machines"), and "Wielkie lanie" ("The Great Spanking") were included into the cycle ''[[The Cyberiad]]''.

On the other hand, one of the stories from ''The Cyberiad'', "O królewiczu Ferrycym i królewnie Krystali" ("About Prince Ferricius and Princess Crystal"), stylistically belongs to the ''Fables'' cycle.

The remaining fables are:

* "Trzej elektrycerze"/"The Three Electroknights"
* "Uranowe uszy"/"Uranium Ears"
* "Jak Erg Samowzbudnik Bladawca pokonał"/"How Erg the Self-Inducting Slew a Paleface"
* "Skarby króla Biskalara"/"Treasures of King Biskalar" (not translated into English)
* "Dwa potwory"/"Two Monsters"
* "Biała śmierć"/"The White Death"
*"Jak Mikromił i Gigacyan ucieczkę mgławic wszczęli"/"How Mikromil and Gigatian Provoked the Runaway of Nebulae" ("How Mocrox and Gigant Made the Universe Expand")
* "Bajka o maszynie cyfrowej, co ze smokiem walczyła" ("Tale of the Computer That Fought a Dragon"); also included into the 1991 Polish edition of the ''Cyberiad'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?837545 Bibliographical data for the "Tale of the Computer That Fought a Dragon"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Doradcy króla Hydropsa"/"The Advisers of King Hydrops"
* "Przyjaciel Automateusza"/"Automatthew's Friend"
* "Król Globares i mędrcy"/"King Globares and the Sages"
* "Bajka o królu Murdasie"/"The Tale of King Murdas"

Additionally the 1993 collection ''Pożytek ze smoka''  contained the short story "Zagadka" ("Riddle"), written in 1980, a discussion of Father Cynkan, M.D. (Doctor Magneticus) and Father Chlorjan about the apocryphal possibility of non-ferrous life and how such beings could reproduce, without any design documentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solaris.lem.pl/ksiazki/beletrystyka/zagadka/145-fragment-zagadka 'Zagadka'], a fragment&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2003, Bartenieff was also teaching at the [[City University of New York]], and in a high school in the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name=business /&gt;

==Life and career==
Bartenieff made his stage debut at the age of 14 in the 1947 [[Broadway theatre]] production ''The Whole World Over'', directed by [[Harold Clurman]].&lt;ref name=business&gt;[https://www.nyfa.org/level4.asp?id=230&amp;fid=1&amp;sid=51&amp;tid=196 "The Long Run: A Performer's Life"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007102557/https://www.nyfa.org/level4.asp?id=230&amp;fid=1&amp;sid=51&amp;tid=196 |date=October 7, 2013 }} ''[[New York Foundation for the Arts|New York Foundation for the Arts Quarterly]]'' (Summer 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  After appearing in a few shows on Broadway, Bartenieff went to London for training at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts]], where he "fell in love" with the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].&lt;ref name=business /&gt;  His intention at the time was to be a classical actor, and his hero was [[Laurence Olivier]].&lt;ref name=business /&gt;

When Bartenieff returned to the United States, he worked with [[Andre Gregory]]'s Theatre for the Living Arts in Philadelphia.  For a number of years in the 1960s, Bartenieff worked with Gregory in Philadelphia, on Broadway, for [[Joe Papp]]'s [[New York Shakespeare Festival]], and in "cross-disciplinary"  showcases at the [[Judson Poets Theatre]] at the [[Judson Church]] in [[Greenwich Village]].&lt;ref name=business /&gt;

Bartenieff also began to do "street theatre" at this time.  One production, with writer/carpenter/landscape artist Bib Nichols, protested against the [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]] which [[Robert Moses]] wanted to build across the island.  Their production played in the street in the neighborhoods which would be affected by the highway, [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]] and the [[West Village]]; the set was constructed in such a way that if a car came by, it would break apart to allow the vehicle to proceed.&lt;ref name=business /&gt;

In 1970, feeling that the Judson Poets Theatre had passed its peak, four artists involved in it &amp;ndash; Bartenieff, his wife at the time, dancer [[Crystal Field]], director Larry Kornfield and Theo Barnes &amp;ndash; wanted to start their own "cross-disciplinary theater which emphasized poetic language", according to Bartenieff.  The [[Westbeth Artists Community]] had just started at the time, and a large space appropriate for performance became available in the complex.  This was the beginning of [[Theatre for the New City]], which still exists, albeit in other quarters.&lt;ref name=business /&gt; TNC not only did their own work, they invited other companies, such as [[Mabou Mines]], the Talking Band, and [[Richard Foreman]]'s company, to perform there.  They also mounted street theatre productions, with the purpose of making "the theater part of the community, and the community part of the theater."&lt;ref name=business /&gt;

Bartenieff stayed with Theatre for the New City for 24 years &amp;ndash; performing, directing or producing more than 900 new American plays&lt;ref name=questions&gt;Fitch, Clyde. [http://www.clydefitchreport.com/2012/10/5-questions-ive-never-been-asked-george-bartenieff/ "5 Questions I’ve Never Been Asked: George Bartenieff"] ''The Clyde Fitch Report'' (October 7, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; but left when he began to feel he was spending more time on the financial problems of the company than he was on his craft. "I had to return," said Bartenieff, "to my own work, from being the [[Cecil B. DeMille]] of off-off-Broadway to the idea that small is more."  To this end, he collaborated with his wife, playwright and director Karen Malpede, to create a one-man show, ''I Will Bear Witness'', an adaptation of the memoirs of [[Victor Klemperer]], which documented daily life as a Jewish professor in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=business /&gt;  This production was the beginning of Bartenieff and Malpede's Theater Three Collaborative, which as of 2012 was 17 years old.&lt;ref name=questions /&gt;

'''''Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show''''' is an [[internet]] [[comedy]] [[talk show]] [[parody]] starring a Japanese character called Kiko. The video series debuted on [[YouTube]] in 2007 and was created by husband-and-wife team [[Greg Benson]] and Kim Evey's production company, [[Mediocre Films]]. In spring 2008, a distribution deal with [[Sony Pictures]] resulted in 10 new episodes to premiere weekly on the company's [[Crackle (company)|C-Spot]] YouTube channel and its [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]] web video site.&lt;ref name="peera"&gt;Iman Peera.

Retrieved 2008-03-29.&lt;/ref&gt; A second season premiered on C-Spot's channel on September 19, 2008.

==History==

===Independent episodes===
Originally developed for a live [[Improvisational theatre|improv]] venue,&lt;ref name="lowry"&gt;Brian Lowry. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117984292.html?categoryid=1682&amp;cs=1 "Can tiny Web shows leap to TV?

Retrieved 2008-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt; the show's first online episode was uploaded to [[YouTube]] on February 25, 2007. It was featured on the site, and quickly rose to [[viral video]] status. As of May 28, 2007, it had over 1.4 million views on YouTube and had been featured on a wide variety of other sites. The episode was screened at the [[Fantasia Festival|FanTasia Festival]] on July 20, 2007, marking its Canadian premiere on screen.&lt;ref name="fantasia"&gt;[http://www.fantasiafestival.com/2007/en/films/film_detail.php?id=344 Films + Schedule: Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show], FanTasia Festival schedule.

[[David Spade]] took particular interest in the fledgling series,&lt;ref name="deadbolt"&gt;Troy Rogers. [http://www.thedeadbolt.com/news/104417/adamarkin_interview.php "Adam Arkin Talks The Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show,"] ''The Deadbolt'' (undated). Retrieved 2008-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt; promoting it on his show, ''[[The Showbiz Show with David Spade]]''. Pairing with Mediocre Films, they created an episode specifically for his show in which one of his co-workers is a guest on Kiko's show.&lt;ref name="showbiz"&gt;[http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/player.jhtml?ml_video=86288&amp;ml_collection=&amp;ml_gateway=&amp;ml_gateway_id=&amp;ml_comedian=&amp;ml_runtime=&amp;ml_context=show&amp;ml_origin_url=%2Fmotherload%2Findex.jhtml%3Fml_video%3D86288&amp;ml_playlist=&amp;lnk=&amp;is_large=true "The Showbiz Show" interviews Kiko], May 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="showbizshowblog"&gt;[http://www.theshowbizshow.com/index.jhtml?c=v&amp;m=38752 "The Showbiz Show" blog], May 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A second episode was uploaded on YouTube, but shortly taken off the site by the producers. A [[vlog]] by Benson was quickly posted stating that new episodes would be coming, and negotiations were being made about the fate of the show. On May 10, 2007, a Kiko [[music video]] excerpted from the original episode two and titled "JUICY!" was posted.

After considerable delays, a revised second episode was uploaded to YouTube on May 29, 2007. This episode was chosen as "YouTube Star of the Moment" by viewers of the ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'' program on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] for the week ending June 10, 2007; host [[Kevin Pereira]] described the show as "a cross between [[David Letterman|Letterman]], [[Pee-Wee Herman]], [[Steve Irwin]], [[Emeril]], and a Japanese schoolgirl on [[methamphetamine|meth]]."&lt;ref name="AOTS-mf"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT-41OJ4pQQ Clips from ''Attack of the Show'' (June 4 and June 10)], uploaded to YouTube by Mediocre Films.

===Sony episodes===
After a long hiatus, a third episode was finally uploaded to YouTube on March 28, 2008, in conjunction with the show's debut as part of C-Spot and Crackle. It was announced at that time that C-Spot would release 10 episodes, coming out on successive Fridays as part of an original-programming lineup of six programs. The fourth episode, featuring [[pornographic actor]] [[Ron Jeremy]], drew increased media attention around its April 4, 2008, debut, with ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; Web Scout article titled "Sony's C-Spot: New Web comedy lineup surprisingly clean despite Ron Jeremy cameo."&lt;ref name="latimes-blog"&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/03/sony-debuts-six.html "Sony's C-Spot: New Web comedy lineup surprisingly clean despite Ron Jeremy cameo,"] March 30, 2008.

[[Monsters and Critics]] reported that same week that the series would be available on C-Spot via several channels of distributions, including AOL Video, Hulu, YouTube and Crackle, as well as through [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]]'s [[V CAST|V Cast]] and directly to Sony's [[BRAVIA|Bravia]] televisions. The same story indicated that additional episodes would have guest appearances by writer-actor [[Wil Wheaton]], actor-director [[Adam Arkin]], and actor-director [[Michael O'Keefe]];&lt;ref name="m-and-c"&gt;"Smallscreen News: Sony taps Wil Wheaton, others for C-Spot, web comedy destination," April 1, 2008.

Wheaton would instead end up on the May 30th episode.

==Format==
Episodes follow a fairly standard format: The episode begins with the theme song followed by Kiko introducing herself as the host and introducing the guest ("please for you to crap hands and cheering for..."), mispronouncing their name in an off-color fashion, and then bringing the guest star out from a side curtain.  The guest attempts to correct Kiko's pronunciation, but Kiko continues mispronouncing the guest's name throughout the show (and subtitles reflect the mispronunciation, not the correct name).

Kiko usually leads the guests through a series of zany activities (which usually make the guest rather uncomfortable), which are usually interrupted by Kiko announcing, "Now it's time to spin the Wheel of Fun!"  Kiko spins a wheel of a chicken, and when it lands on a space (containing unspecified Japanese characters) pointed to by the chicken's beak, she indicates yet another zany activity for the characters to participate in.

The show ends with the guest star appearing very uncomfortable/confused and Kiko announcing the end of the show as the credits roll.

==Recurring characters==
&lt;!-- This section is for characters who make more than one appearance; guest stars do not belong UNLESS they return in later episodes. --&gt;
Kiko is played by Evey, who also writes the series. While the character is [[Japanese people|Japanese]], Evey was born in [[South Korea]] and grew up in the United States.&lt;ref name="eveyoffbio"&gt;[http://www.kimevey.com/bio.htm Biographical profile] at KimEvey.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green Thumb Theatre''' (also known as the '''Green Thumb Theatre for Young People''' and simply as '''Green Thumb''') is a Canadian children's [[theatre]] company based in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia that was founded by Dennis Foon and Jane Howard Baker in 1975. The couple then went on to conceive and write '''New Canadian Kid''', the company's signature play about a young boy who struggles with culture shock and bullying after immigrating to Canada. The play has been produced world wide for close to 40 years. &lt;ref&gt;Fairhead (2002), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Green Thumb operates in a former school house located in [[East Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulysses Travel Guides (2003), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Green Thumb produced ''[[Feeling Yes, Feeling No]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Selman &amp; Heather (2015), p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[sexual abuse]] prevention program.&lt;ref&gt;Selman &amp; Heather (2015), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Green Thumb performed the premiere of Colin Thomas' play ''One Thousand Cranes'' in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Ross &amp; Cameron (2013), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morris Panych]] has written several plays for the company that have toured internationally.&lt;ref&gt;New (2002), p. 862.&lt;/ref&gt; Green Thumb's ''Celestial Being'' received the 2015 [[Jessie Richardson Theatre Award]] for outstanding production for young audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Georgia Straight]]|title=Théâtre la Seizième Wins Big at 33rd Annual Jessie Richardson Theatre Awards|author=Thomas, Colin|date=June 23, 2015|url=https://www.straight.com/arts/475996/theatre-la-seizieme-wins-big-33rd-annual-jessie-richardson-theatre-awards|accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Green Thumb performed [[George F.

[[File:George Clinton Parliament Funkadelic.jpg|thumb|Funk music such as the type performed by groups like [[Parliament Funkadelic]] uses catchy electric bass lines and drum patterns to create a propulsive, emphatic [[rhythm]]ic "feel" that is often referred to as a "groove".]]

In music, '''groove''' is the sense of propulsive [[rhythm]]ic "feel" or sense of "[[Swing (jazz performance style)|swing]]". In [[jazz]], it can be felt as a persistently repeated pattern. It can be created by the interaction of the music played by a band's [[rhythm section]] (e.g. drums, [[bass guitar|electric bass]] or [[double bass]], guitar, and keyboards). Groove is a significant feature of [[popular music]], and can be found in many genres, including [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[funk]], [[rock music|rock]], [[fusion (music)|fusion]], and [[soul music|soul]].

[[File:Characteristic rock drum pattern.png|350px|thumb|Characteristic rock groove: "bass drum on beats 1 and 3 and snare drum on beats 2 and 4 of the measure...add eighth notes on the hi-hat".&lt;ref&gt;Peckman, Jonathan (2007). Picture Yourself Drumming, p.50. {{ISBN|1-59863-330-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Characteristic rock drum pattern.mid|Play}}]]

From a broader [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicological]] perspective, groove has been described as "an unspecifiable but ordered sense of something that is sustained in a distinctive, regular and attractive way, working to draw the listener in."&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;  [[Musicology|Musicologists]] and other scholars have analyzed the concept of "groove" since around the 1990s. They have argued that a "groove" is an "understanding of rhythmic patterning" or "feel" and "an intuitive sense" of "a cycle in motion" that emerges from "carefully aligned concurrent rhythmic patterns" that stimulates dancing or foot-tapping on the part of listeners. The concept can be linked to the sorts of [[ostinato]]s that generally accompany fusions and dance musics of [[Music of Africa|African]] derivation (e.g. [[African-American music|African-American]], [[Music of African heritage in Cuba|Afro-Cuban]], Afro-Brazilian, etc.).&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

The term is often applied to musical performances that make one want to move or [[dance]], and enjoyably [[wikt:groove#Verb|"groove"]] (a word that also has sexual connotations).&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; The expression "in the groove" (as in [[In the Groove (composition)|the jazz standard]]) was widely used from around 1936 to 1945, at the height of the swing era,  to describe top-notch jazz performances. In the 1940s and 1950s, groove commonly came to denote musical "routine, preference, style, [or] source of pleasure."&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite web| last1=Kernfeld | first1=Barry | title=Groove (i) | url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/J582400 | work= The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2nd ed. ([[Grove Music Online]]) | publisher=Oxford Music Online|  authorlink=Barry Kernfeld | quote= In the realm of jazz, a persistently repeated pattern. More broadly, Feld (1988), studying groove from an ethnomusicological perspective, defines it cautiously as "an unspecifiable but ordered sense of something that is sustained in a distinctive, regular and attractive way, working to draw the listener in." Connections to dance are important, and the statement that a performance has, or achieves, a groove, usually means that it somehow compels the body to move. Still more generally, the term has a sexual origin and connotation which is obvious, requiring no explanation... Within jazz circles, Gold identifies the phrase "in the groove" – which from around 1936 to 1945 (i.e., during the height of the swing era) was in widespread use in referring to jazz performances which were "excellent" or, by extension, "sophisticated" – and the term "groove" – referring in the 1940s and 1950s to "routine, preference, style, source of pleasure"... Characteristically... [groove] tends to operate with reference to styles from the latter third of the twentieth century which utilize characteristic accompanimental ostinatos drawn from African-derived dance music, whether African-American (e.g., soul, funk, disco, [[hip hop music|rap]], hip-hop), Afro-Cuban dance music (e.g., salsa), or Afro-Brazilian ([[samba]]), or some other such fusion.  | accessdate=16 October 2015}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

===Musicians' perspectives===
[[File:BennyGoodmanStageDoorCanteen.jpg|thumb|Benny Goodman, one of the first swing bandleaders to achieve widespread fame]]
Like the term "[[swing music|swing]]", which is used to describe a cohesive rhythmic "feel" in a jazz context, the concept of "groove" can be hard to define. Indeed, some dictionaries use the terms as synonyms: "Groovy...[d]enotes music that really swings."{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}  Marc Sabatella's article ''Establishing The Groove'' argues that "groove is a completely subjective thing." He claims that "one person may think a given drummer has a great feel, while another person may think the same drummer sounds too stiff, and another may think he is too loose."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outsideshore.com/school/music/almanac/html/Accompanying/Drums/Establishing_The_Groove.htm Accompanying: Drums: Establishing The Groove&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a bass educator states that while "groove is an elusive thing" it can be defined as "what makes the music breathe" and the "sense of motion in the context of a song".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subcontrabassist.com/Lessons/CreatingGroove.htm Stews Lessons: Creating The Groove&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210103528/http://www.subcontrabassist.com/Lessons/CreatingGroove.htm |date=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a musical context, general dictionaries define a groove as "a pronounced, enjoyable rhythm" or the act of "creat[ing], danc[ing] to, or enjoy[ing] rhythmic music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-groove.html|title=Definition of groove|work=allwords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/groove|title=groove|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Van Telejuice explains the "groove" as the point in this sense when he defines it as a point in a song or performance when "even the people who can't dance wanna feel like dancing..." due to the effect of the music.

Bernard Coquelet argues that the "groove is the way an experienced musician will play a rhythm compared with the way it is written (or would be written)" by playing slightly "before or after the beat". Coquelet claims that the "notion of groove actually has to do with aesthetics and style"; "groove is an artistic element, that is to say human,...and "it will evolve depending on the harmonic context, the place in the song, the sound of the musician's instrument, and, in interaction with the groove of the other musicians", which he calls "collective" groove".&lt;ref&gt;

===Theoretical analysis===
UK musicologist [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]] (1999) notes that while "the concept of ''groove''" has "long [been] familiar in musicians' own usage", musicologists and theorists have only more recently begun to analyze this concept.&lt;ref name="Middleton"&gt;Middleton, Richard (1999). ''Form'', in "Key Terms in Popular Music and Culture". Malden, Massachusetts. {{ISBN|0-631-21263-9}}. p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Middleton states that a groove "... marks an understanding of rhythmic patterning that underlies its role in producing the characteristic rhythmic 'feel' of a piece". He notes that the "feel created by a repeating framework" is also modified with [[Variation (music)|variation]]s.&lt;ref name="Middleton"/&gt; "Groove", in terms of pattern-sequencing, is also known as "[[shuffle note]]"—where there is deviation from exact step positions.

When the musical slang phrase "Being in the groove" is applied to a group of improvisers, this has been called "an advanced level of development for any improvisational music group", which is "equivalent to Bohm and Jaworski's descriptions of an evoked field", which systems dynamics scholars claim are "forces of unseen connection that directly influence our experience and behaviour".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20170701124012/https://www.systemdynamics.org/conferences/1999/PAPERS/WSHOP2.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Forrester and John Bailey argue that the "chances of achieving this higher level of playing" (i.e., attain a "groove") are improved when the musicians are "open to other's musical ideas", "finding ways of complementing other participant's {{sic}} musical ideas", and "taking risks with the music".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Turry and Aigen cite Feld's definition of groove as "an intuitive sense of style as process, a perception of a cycle in motion, a form or organizing pattern being revealed, a recurrent clustering of elements through time". Aigen states that "when [a] groove is established among players, the musical whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts, enabling a person [...] to experience something beyond himself which he[/she] cannot create alone (Aigen 2002, p.34)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicalus.blogspot.com/2006/08/definition-and-philosophy-of-music.html Delicate Thoughts: Music, Mind and Humanity: Definition and Philosophy of Music Therapy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Pressing's 2002 article claimed that a "groove or feel" is "a cognitive temporal phenomenon emerging from one or more carefully aligned concurrent rhythmic patterns, characterized by...perception of recurring pulses, and subdivision of structure in such pulses,...perception of a cycle of time, of length 2 or more pulses, enabling identification of cycle locations, and...effectiveness of engaging synchronizing body responses (e.g. dance, foot-tapping)".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070610051132/http://www.uni-hamburg.de/Wiss/FB/09/Musik/Dozenten/Pfleiderer/Escom5.pdf lang_fr] [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.uni-hamburg.de/Wiss/FB/09/Musik/Dozenten/Pfleiderer/Escom5.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscientific perspectives===
The "groove" has been cited as an example of [[sensory-motor coupling]] between neural systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Janata | first1 = P.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensory-motor coupling is the coupling or integration of the [[sensory nervous system|sensory system]] and [[motor system]]. Sensorimotor integration is not a static process. For a given [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], there is no one single motor command. "Neural responses at almost every stage of a sensorimotor pathway are modified at short and long timescales by [[Biophysics|biophysical]] and [[synapse|synaptic]] processes, [[Recurrent neural networks|recurrent]] and [[feedback]] connections, and [[learning]], as well as many other internal and external variables".&lt;ref name="bug"&gt;Huston, S.

Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 21(4). doi: 10.1016/j.conb.2011.05.030&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has shown that at least some styles of modern groove-oriented rock music are characterized by an "[[aesthetics]] of exactitude" and the strongest groove stimulation could be observed for drum patterns without microtiming deviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Use in different genres==

===R&amp;B===
The "groove" is also associated with funk performers, such as [[James Brown]]'s drummers [[Clyde Stubblefield]] and [[John "Jabo" Starks|Jabo Starks]], and with soul music. "In the 1950s, when '[[funk]]' and 'funky' were used increasingly as adjectives in the context of soul music—the meaning being transformed from the original one of a pungent odor to a re-defined meaning of a strong, distinctive groove." As "[t]he soul dance music of its day, the basic idea of funk was to create as intense a groove as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://randb.about.com/od/rb12/p/FunkMusic.htm|title='Funk' Music|author=Mark Edward Nero|work=About.com Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When a drummer plays a groove that "is very solid and with a great feel...", this is referred to informally as being "in the pocket"; when a drummer "maintains this feel for an extended period of time, never wavering, this is often referred to as a deep pocket."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drummercafe.com/education/articles/in-the-pocket.html|title=In The Pocket - Articles - Drummer Cafe|author=Bart Elliott|work=Drummer Cafe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hip hop===
A concept similar to "groove" or "swing" is also used in other African-American genres such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]. The rhythmic groove that [[jazz]] artists call a sense of “swing” is sometimes referred to as having "flow" in the hip hop scene. "Flow is as elemental to hip hop as the concept of swing is to jazz". Just as the jazz concept of "swing" involves performers deliberately playing behind or ahead of the beat, the hip-hop concept of flow is about "funking with one's expectations of time"—that is, the rhythm and pulse of the music.&lt;ref&gt;William Jelani Cobb. ''To the break of dawn: a freestyle on the hip hop aesthetic ''. 2007. Page 87-88. {{ISBN|0-8147-1670-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Flow is not about ''what'' is being said so much as ''how'' one is saying it".&lt;ref&gt;Cobb (2007), p.90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz===
In some more traditional styles of jazz, the musicians often use the word "swing" to describe the sense of rhythmic cohesion of a skilled group. However, since the 1950s, musicians from the [[organ trio]] and [[latin jazz]] subgenres have also used the term "groove". Jazz flute player [[Herbie Mann]] talks a lot about "the groove." In the 1950s, Mann "locked into a Brazilian groove in the early '60s, then moved into a funky, soulful groove in the late '60s and early '70s. By the mid-'70s he was making hit [[disco]] records, still cooking in a rhythmic groove." He describes his approach to finding the groove as follows: "All you have to do is find the waves that are comfortable to float on top of." Mann argues that the "epitome of a groove record" is "''[[Memphis Underground]]'' or ''[[Push Push (album)|Push Push]]''", because the "rhythm section [is] locked all in one perception."
&lt;ref&gt;Port Folio Weekly, 2002. http://www.jimnewsom.com/HerbieMannInterview.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reggae===
In Jamaican [[reggae]], [[dancehall]], and [[dub music]], the creole term "[[riddim]]" is used to describe the rhythm patterns created by the drum pattern or a prominent bassline. In other musical contexts a "riddim" would be called a "groove" or beat. One of the widely copied "riddims", ''Real Rock'', was recorded in 1967 by Sound Dimension. "It was built around a single, emphatic bass note followed by a rapid succession of lighter notes. The pattern repeated over and over hypnotically. The sound was so powerful that it gave birth to an entire style of reggae meant for slow dancing called ''rub a dub.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kenner|first1=Rob|title=MUSIC; 'Real Rock' Through the Ages|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/arts/music-real-rock-through-the-ages.html|accessdate=25 October 2017|work=The New York Times|date=23 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groove metal===

[[File:Rex brown down base player.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Bassist [[Rex Brown]] from the metal band Pantera, a band associated with the "groove metal" scene.]]
Influenced by the sound of [[Bad Brains]], in the 1990s the term "groove" was also used to describe elements of a form of [[thrash metal]] called [[groove metal]], which is based around the use of mid-tempo thrash [[riff]]s and detuned power chords played with heavy [[syncopation]]. "Speed wasn’t the main point anymore, it was what [[Pantera]] singer [[Phil Anselmo]] called the 'power groove.' Riffs became unusually heavy without the need of [[death growl|growling]] or the extremely distorted guitars of [[death metal]], rhythms depended more on a heavy groove."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groove metal drums typically use double-bass drumming, with emphasis on using the double bass drum in waves, rather than rapid fire double bass and [[blast beats]] used in [[extreme metal]] styles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Uncommon time signatures and [[polyrhythm]]s are typical for some bands, and generally these bands put heavy emphasis on the changing beat.

With heavy metal, the term "groove" can also be associated with [[stoner metal]], [[sludge metal]], [[doom metal]] and [[death metal]] genres as well as [[djent]].

'''''Nihongami''''' (日本髪), is one of many traditional [[Culture of Japan|Japanese]] [[hairstyles]], dating to the [[Edo period]], today most often seen on ''[[maiko]]'' ([[geisha]] apprentices). Traditionally, two sides of the hair stick out until it curves to the back. The hair is pulled in the back as well in the front.

Other maiko hairstyles include [[wareshinobu]] (only worn during the actual apprenticeship, with a round curve on the top and sides and a round bun in the middle), [[Ofuku]], [[Yakko-shimada]], [[Katsuyama (hairstyle)|Katsuyama]], and [[Sakko]]. [[Gion Kobu]] maiko wear a special hairstyle for the [[Miyako Odori]].

Nihongami requires special combs and supplies, such as a special wax called [[Bintsuke]]. [[Kanzashi]], special hair ornaments, usually accompany this style.

Other Japanese hairstyles:
* [[Bunkin Shimada]]
* [[Kikugasane]]
* [[Mae Ware]]
* [[Oshidori No Hina]]
* [[Oshiyun]]
* [[Shimada (hairstyle)|Shimada]]

{{Refimprove|date=April 2008}}
'''''The&lt;!--see [[WP:THE#Titles of works and publications]]--&gt; Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide''''' (or '''''Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide''''') is an annually published [[comic book price guide]] widely considered the primary authority on the subject of American [[comic book]] grading and pricing in the hobby/industry. 
Many observers tie in the growth of the [[direct market]] distribution system and comic book specialty shops to the general acceptance of Overstreet's annual guide as a standardized inventory and pricing system.&lt;ref name="Arrowheads" /&gt;

Begun in [[1970 in comics|1970]] by Robert M. Overstreet as a guide for fellow fans of [[Golden Age (comics)|Golden Age]] and [[Silver Age (comics)|Silver Age]] comics, the ''Overstreet'' guide has expanded to cover virtually the entire history of the American comics publication as far back as the Victorian Age and [[Platinum Age]]. The annual edition also covers promotional comics (giveaways and advertising) and "big little books," while continually updating new publications and market reports that cover the prior year of market activity.

Overstreet's annual guide to the comic book collecting hobby has itself become a collectible, and since the 1980s each edition of the ''Price Guide'' includes a page listing collector's values for older editions, with [[hardcover]] editions, in particular, selling for a premium. Currently, the ''Price Guide'' is published in four formats: hardcover, [[softcover]], a larger, ring-bound edition and an electronic edition, often with multiple covers for each version.

== History ==
Robert M. Overstreet grew up as a comic book, [[Coin collecting|coin]], and [[Native American (Americas)|Indian]] [[arrowhead]] collector. In the 1960s, after abandoning a project to create an arrowhead price guide, Overstreet turned his attention to comics, which had no definitive guide.&lt;ref name="Arrowheads"&gt;[http://www.arrowheads.com/community/who-is-bob "Who is Robert M. Overstreet?"] Arrowheads.com. Accessed Nov. 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comic back-issue prices had stabilized by the end of the 1960s,&lt;ref name="CBG"&gt;Thompson, Maggie. [http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/the-1900s-the-century-in-comics "November 1970: Mint Never Meant So Much Before,"] "The 1900s: 10 biggest events from 100 years in comics," ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' #1365 (Jan. 14, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; and, [[Jerry Bails]], who had recently published the ''Collector’s Guide to the First Heroic Age'', was considering creating a comic book price guide. He was contacted by Overstreet, who was doing the same thing. Bails' extensive notes, supplemented by Overstreet's study of dealer listings, "became a backbone to the ''Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide''."&lt;ref name="Friends"&gt;Ray Bottorff, Jr., quoted in "With a Little Help From His Friends...", ''Alter Ego'' vol. 3, #25 (June 2003), pp. 14-19.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under the auspices of Overstreet Publications, the first ''Comic Book Price Guide'' was published in November 1970. Priced at $5, saddle-stitched and published in a print run of 1000 (a second edition of 800 was released subsequently),&lt;ref&gt;[http://scoop.previewsworld.com/Home/4/1/73/1017?articleID=42897 "The Semi-Secret Origins of the ''Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide'',"] Scoop (Mar. 15, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; the book included 218 pages of listings. Among other things, Overstreet's guide included inventory lists, and it instantly became an invaluable resource tool for comic book collectors and dealers.&lt;ref name="CBG" /&gt; By 1976, the guide had achieved national distribution.&lt;ref name="Arrowheads" /&gt;

An early decision was made by author to exclude the niche of [[underground comix]], an adult-oriented expression of the genre that Mr. Overstreet had no interest in documenting, for reasons he has never made public,{{cn|date=November 2011}} despite the book being promoted by its publisher as "the most complete listing of comics from the 1500s to the present."

=== Overstreet periodicals ===
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Overstreet also produced publications that would serve price updates regarding newer comics releases from the present, to selected titles dating from the Silver Age, including a price guide to current and valuable comics, as well as comic book and collector news, and interviews. There was also some editorial content from the publishers, and from polled bookstore owners. Various incarnations of the publication (which were published quarterly to bi-monthly, and eventually monthly) included ''Overstreet's Comic Book Price Update'', ''Overstreet's Comics Price Bulletin'',''Overstreet Comic Book Monthly'', and ''Overstreet's Fan'', with this last incarnation showing a great deal of similarity to the successful comics news magazine ''[[Wizard: The Guide to Comics]]''. Overstreet also published twenty-one issues of ''Comic Book Marketplace'' between Mar./Apr. 1993 and January 1995. Ultimately, most titles were canceled, including ''Overstreet's Fan'' which ceased publication in 1997.

=== Sale to Gemstone ===
Overstreet sold the business to [[Gemstone Publishing]] in 1994, and continues to serve as author of the annual guides and associated publications.

In July 2003, Gemstone attempted another monthly by publishing ''Overstreet's Comic Price Review'', which ran only for nineteen issues.

The 48th edition (2018-2019) of the ''Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide'' went on sale July 18, 2018.

'''''Panto!''''' is a 2012 one-off Christmas special, made by [[Baby Cow Productions]] and broadcast by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on Thursday 27 December 2012.
The special centres on Lewis Loud, a local Morecambe [[disk jockey]] in his stage debut of [[Dick Whittington and His Cat|Dick Whittington]] 
at the [[Grand Theatre, Lancaster]] as Jack the Lad.

== Plot ==
Lewis Loud ([[John Bishop (comedian)|John Bishop]]) is doing his early morning radio show at Morecambe FM &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartsdesk.com/tv/panto-itv1 Panto!, ITV1 -- Comedian's co-written comic drama follows festive conventions flawlessly], by Lisa-Marie Ferla, 27 December 2012, Retrieved 29 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; with his less than impressed producer Deborah ([[Lisa Jackson (actress)|Lisa Jackson]]) at his side. After the show, Lewis heads to rehearsals for his first ever pantomime Dick Whittington where a romance between him and Dick, Tamsin ([[Sheridan Smith]]) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/production/2012/11/john-bishop-to-write-and-star-in-itv-panto-comedy John Bishop to write and star in ITV panto comedy], by Matthew Hemley, The Stage News, Retrieved 29 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; has been blossoming. Tamsin is also known as 'Mad Mindy, The Axe Murderer' from the nation's favourite soap. A full dress-rehearsal has been called for the show &lt;ref&gt;[http://primetime.unrealitytv.co.uk/an-all-star-cast-join-comedian-john-bishop-in-panto-on-itv-tonight An all star cast join comedian John Bishop in Panto! on ITV tonight!], by TV Writer Lynn, 27 December 2012, Unreality Primetime, Retrieved 29 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  by Producer Di ([[Samantha Spiro]]) as tensions begin to build. Di's nervous daughter Chantelle (Ami Metcalf) stars as the obvious miscast love interest of Dick while Director Francis ([[Mark Benton]]) tries hard to pull the show together while Di keeps interfering with his decisions. Johnny Darby ([[Michael Cochrane]]) a famous Channel 5 star goes into drag while accident prone Chesney Hawkes tries to make the show. While all this is happening, Lewis' son Paul (played by Bishop's real-life son Daniel) is dropped off with him while Lewis' ex-wife Gina ([[Kaye Wragg]]) and her new boyfriend Tony ([[Trevor Dwyer-Lynch]]) go on an exotic holiday that they won by creating a jingle for a toilet company. Tamsin however gets offered by her agent Jerry ([[Kenneth Cranham]]) to go on Celebrity Sleigh Ride, a new reality show which sees celebrities battling to the North Pole with a vote-off day to day. Tamsin takes the offer with her agent also offering Lewis to go but he declines to face his responsibility with Paul. The cast is then reformed to match the show with Paul playing the cat and Greg Chip (Dean Whatton) the original cat playing Dick. Gina dumps Tony to be on her own after coming back from the airport after their flights were cancelled as the toilet company went bust. At the end, Lewis &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2012/11/12/16521/john_bishop_brings_panto!_to_itv John Bishop brings Panto! to ITV], from ''Chortle, The UK Comedy Guide''; retrieved 29 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; plays football with Paul after the show was a success.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59983">'''Soviet montage theory''' is an approach to understanding and creating [[film|cinema]] that relies heavily upon [[film editing|editing]] (''[[wikt:montage#French|montage]]'' is [[French language|French]] for "assembly" or "editing"). It is the principal contribution of [[Soviet]] film theorists to global cinema, and brought [[Formalist film theory|formalism]] to bear on [[filmmaking]].

Although [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet filmmakers]] in the 1920s disagreed about how exactly to view montage, [[Sergei Eisenstein]] marked a note of accord in "A Dialectic Approach to Film Form" when he noted that montage is "the nerve of cinema", and that "to determine the nature of montage is to solve [[Medium specificity|the specific problem]] of cinema". Its influence is far reaching commercially, academically, and politically. Alfred Hitchcock cites editing (and montage indirectly) as the lynchpin of worthwhile filmmaking. In fact, montage is demonstrated in the majority of narrative fiction film available today. Post-Soviet film theories relied extensively on montage's redirection of film analysis toward language, a literal grammar of film. A semiotic understanding of film, for example, is indebted to and in contrast with Sergei Eisenstein's wanton transposition of language "in ways that are altogether new."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Film Language; A Semiotics of Cinema|last = Metz|first = Christian|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1974|isbn = |location = |pages = 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; While several Soviet filmmakers, such as [[Lev Kuleshov]], [[Dziga Vertov]], [[Esfir Shub]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] put forth explanations of what constitutes the montage effect, Eisenstein's view that "montage is an idea that arises from the collision of independent shots" wherein "each sequential element is perceived not ''next'' to the other, but on ''top'' of the other" has become most widely accepted.

The production of films—how and under what conditions they are made—was of crucial importance to Soviet leadership and filmmakers. Films that focused on individuals rather than masses were deemed counterrevolutionary, but not exclusively so. The collectivization of filmmaking was central to the programmatic realization of the Communist state. [[Kino-Eye]] forged a film and newsreel collective that sought the dismantling of bourgeois notions of artistry above the needs of the people. Labor, movement, the machinery of life, and the everyday of Soviet citizens coalesced in the content, form, and productive character of Kino-eye repertoire.

The bulk of influence, beginning from the [[October 1917 Revolution]] until the late 1950s (oftentimes referred to as the Stalin era), brought a cinematic language to the fore and provided the groundwork for contemporary editing and documentary techniques, as well as providing a starting point for more advanced theories.

== Montage ==
Montage theory, in its rudimentary form, asserts that a series of connected images allows for complex ideas to be extracted from a sequence and, when strung together, constitute the entirety of a film's ideological and intellectual power. In other words, the editing of shots rather than the content of the shot alone constitutes the force of a film. Many directors still believe that montage is what defines cinema against other specific media. Vsevolod Illarionovich Pudovkin, for example, claimed that words were thematically inadequate, despite silent cinema's use of intertitles to make narrative connections between shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Film Technique.

=== Background === 
Confined to the project of Soviet expansion, film theorists of the USSR cared little for questions of meaning. Instead, the writing sought the praxis of filmmaking and theory. The pragmatic and revolutionary application of these movements stands in harsh contrast to ideas being developed simultaneously in Western Europe. Socialist Realism characterized the emergence of art within the constraints of communism. Constructivism, an extension of Futurism, sought a pre-modern integration of art into the everyday. Soviet theorists had a clear job before them: theorize in order to aid the cause of the Communist Party. The ethical and ontological dimensions explored in the West were tabled in lieu of film's potential to reach the millions in far reaches of Soviet territory, where literacy was scarce. Film was a tool with which the state could advance the dictatorship of the proletariat. It was no surprise that most of the Soviet film theorists were also filmmakers.

=== History ===
* ''[[Continuity editing]]'' – Continuity, like montage, situates editing as the driving formal element of narrative film making. DW Griffith developed and implemented a grammar of film through his use of continuity editing by establishing a logical progression of shots as to make a story intelligible to the audience. Continuity differs from montage in both its production, effect and intention. 
** ''Production'' – Continuity maintains a subservience to a predetermined narrative. For example, in Griffith's pinnacle film ''Birth of a Nation'', the editing was completely determined in reaction to the script's narrative. Montage, on the other hand, holds that the dialectical collision of images creates a film's meaning, and thus is less concerned with a script than it is the synthesis of associations between shots. 
** ''Effect and Intention'' – Continuity editing is oriented spatially; meaning it fills gaps between locations and moments in a film's narrative progression. The 180 degree rule, in which an imaginary straight line is imposed by a director in order to create logical association between characters/objects that require a shot-reverse shot, is used to solidify the spectator in a relation to the image in a way that makes visual sense. Montage may include these elements as well, but is not determined by them. Space can be discontinuous in order to disorient a spectator. For example, Dziga Vertov's ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]'' documents the everyday activities of people from various locations in the Soviet Union, but never gives priority to a continuity of action.
* ''[[Sergei Eisenstein]]'' – Though not the inventor of montage, Eisenstein codified its use in Soviet and international film making and theory. Beginning with his initial work in the Proletkult, Eisenstein adapted montage to the cinema and expanded his theories throughout his career to encompass the internal nature of the image. He was the most outspoken and ardent advocate of montage as revolutionary form. His work has been divided into two periods. The first is characterised by "mass dramas" in which his focus is on formalizing Marxist political struggle of the proletariat. His films, ''Strike'' and ''The Battleship Potemkin'' among the most noted of the period, centered on the capacity for the masses to revolt. The second period is characterized by a shift to individualized narratives that sprang from a synchronic understanding of montage inspired by his foray into dialectical materialism as a guiding principle. The shift between the two periods is indicative of the evolution of Marxist thinking writ large, culminating in an understanding of the material underpinning of all social and political phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Dialectical Image: Eisenstein In The Soviet Cinema|last = Mircea|first = Eugenia|date = 2012|journal = Scientific Journal of Humanistic Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though largely uncredited by contemporary filmmakers, Eisenstein's theories are constantly demonstrated in films across genres, nations, languages and politics.
* ''The [[Kuleshov Effect]]'' - Lev Kuleshov's work is largely considered the basis from which all montage theory is derived. The Kuleshov Group, composed of Kuleshov and his students, set out to determine the essence of cinema. Rote repetition of the components of the cinema plagued their initial findings: competent acting, provocative lighting and elaborate scenery were not intrinsic to the filmic form. In a study of two films- "an American and a comparable Russian one"- the group identified the American film as extraordinary given the short average shot time. They then inferred that the American organization of shots was perceptually appealing to audiences. Lengthy shots, as seen in the Russian film, make the task of mentally interpreting a pattern difficult. In an essay published in ''Vestnik Kinematografii'' in 1916, Kuleshov first coined the term montage to explain the phenomena of shot succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kuleshov on Film: Writings|last = Kuleshov|first = Lev|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1974|isbn = |location = Berkeley|pages = 47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a pinnacle experiment, Kuleshov combined independent shots of Ivan Mosjoukine, a bowl of soup, a woman in a coffin, and a woman on a sofa. The strategic ordering of the shots had a marked effect on audience interpretation of the Mosjoukine's neutral expression. This experiment demonstrated cinema's unique capacity as an art form to conjure specific reactions from the relationship between indexical images. It further demonstrated that montage is dialectical in nature, and that the synthesis of images creates unique political meanings. Recently, Kuleshov's conclusions have been brought into question. In ''The Kuleshov Effect: Recreating the Classic Experiment'', Stephen Prince and Wayne E. Hensley contest Kuleshov's findings as unscientific and merely a product of cinematic myth. They conclude that "Kuleshov's effect- understood in terms of shot juxtapositions rather than associational cues- may tell us little about film or visual communication, but its lingering power tells us a lot about the symbolic uses of the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Kuleshov Effect: Recreating the Classic Experiment|last = Hensley|first = Wayne E.|date = 1992|journal = Cinema Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adoption abroad ====
Distance, lack of access, and regulations meant that the formal theory of montage was not widely known until well after its explosion in the Soviet Union. It was only until 1929, for example, that Eisenstein's theories reached Britain in ''Close Up''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = That Magic Force That Is Montage': Eisenstein's Filmic Fourth Dimension, Borderline And H. D.|last = Maclean|first = Caroline|date = 2012|journal = Literature &amp; History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, filmmakers in Japan during the 1920s were "quite unaware of montage" according to Eisenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Eisenstein Reader|last = Eisenstein|first = Sergei|publisher = British Film Institute|year = 1998|isbn = |location = London|pages = 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, both nations produced films that used something tantamount to continuity editing. According to Chris Robé, the internal strife between Soviet theories of montage mirrored the liberal and radical debates in the West. In his book ''Left of Hollywood: Cinema, Modernism, and the Emergence of U.S. Radical Film Culture'', Robé illustrates the Western Left's attempts to tone-down revolutionary language and psychoanalyze characters on the screen. Hanns Sach's essays "Kitsch"(1932) and "Film Psychology" (1928) are used here to demonstrate Kitsch's aesthetic distinction from the Realist project of the Soviet Union, and also to affirm Kitsch's ability to create a more powerful affect than realism ever could. As such, Sach argued, a psychological montage was recognizable in all films, even abstract ones which held no resemblance to classic Soviet cinema. Robé also cites Zygmunt Tonecky's essay "The Preliminary of Art Film" as a reformulation of montage theory in service of abstract cinema. Zygmunt's argument centers around his disagreement with Eisenstein that montage was logical, but rather psychological. As such, abstract films defamiliarize objects and have the potential to create critical spectators. Defamiliarization was seen a catalyst for revolutionary thinking. Clearly, the adoption of Montage Theory was rarely hard and fast, but rather a stepping stone for other theories.

The split between the West and Soviet filmmaking became readily apparent with André Bazin's dismissal of montage and Cahiers du Cinéma's assertion of the primacy of auteurs. The belief that a still, highly composed, and individuated shot marked cinema's artistic significance was an affront to the dialectical method. That individual directors could compose and produce films by themselves (at least in terms of credit and authorship) made impossible the collectivization of filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Eisenstein Reader|last = Eisenstein|first = Sergei|publisher = British Film Institute|year = 1998|isbn = |location = London|pages = 134–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein's later work (''Alexander Nevsky'' [1938] and ''Ivan the Terrible'' [1944-1946]), would undercut his earlier film's appeal to masses by locating the narrative on a single individual.

==== Contemporary uses ====

The term montage has undergone radical popular redefinition in the last 30 years. It is commonly used to refer to a sequence of short shots used to demonstrate the passage of prolonged time. A famous example is the training sequence in ''Rocky'' (Avildsen 1976) in which weeks of preparation on represented through a sequence of disparate exercise footage. ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' (Hughes 1986) demonstrates the same concept in order to collapse several hours into a few short minutes of footage throughout Chicago. This differs entirely from even the most conservative interpretations of montage in the Soviet Union, wherein time is subordinate to the collision of images and their symbolic meaning.

=== Terms and concepts ===

* ''Dialectic'' – A relationship of conflict that results in a new form. This is taken explicitly and directly from Marx's explanation of the dialectic as the process by which social and political change occurs. There are varying and competing interpretations of how this was to be practiced in Soviet cinema, but the embedding of a dialectical process to montage was an understood goal of most notable Soviet filmmakers. The dialectic traditionally is composed thus: 
** ''Thesis'' – An initial force, statement, or mode. For film, thesis could be narrative, as in the foregrounded social harmony that is later disrupted; visual, like an opening shot of a sequence; or historical presumption, an economic and political situation which carries particular assumptions about the film's context. 
** ''Antithesis'' – A conflictual force, statement, or mode designed to negate or otherwise amend the thesis in some way.It is at the point of antithesis that some disagreement occurs. Pudovkin's belief that images build upon one another over the course of the film functions differently than Eisenstein's theory of collision. These two interpretations situate antithesis as either negation (Eisenstein) or addition (Pudovkin). The implication is that the synthetic result is either product (here product is used in the mathematical sense; the multiplication of syntheses) or cumulative, respectively.
** ''Synthesis'' – The result of the conflict between the antithesis and thesis, which possess within it the mechanics of its own undoing. Montage was an editorial process whereby new concepts were possible only through the relating of two or more shots, and/or the relationship of elements within a single shot. The affective result might be best demonstrated through the cattle slaughter scene in Strike, in which images of violence inflicted on workers is cut within images of a cow being slaughtered in an abattoir. These images work dialectically to produce revulsion and disgust at the notion of the oppression of the proletariat.
* ''Stimulants'' – A formal element whose combination with other elements produces the sum total of montage's effect. Its modifiers "Dominant" and "Secondary" are taken from musical composition theory in which harmonic and melodic resonances are reactions to dominant and secondary notes, chords, beats and time signatures.
** ''Dominant'' – The element or stimulus that determines all subsequent and subordinate elements or stimuli. For films that implement Montage Theory, these dominant elements are determined prior to shooting and inform the script and editing process. Not all dominants are singular elements (lighting, allusion, timing, etc.) but can be the product or sum total of all stimulants. For example, in ''The General Line'', Eisenstein determined dominant stimulants based on the composition of single shots "by the method of 'democratic' equal rights for all the stimulants, viewed together as a complex".&lt;ref name="Eisenstein 17"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Eisenstein Reader|last = Eisenstein|first = Sergei|publisher = British Film Institute|year = 1998|isbn = |location = London|pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Eisenstein's attempt to parallel Japanese Kabuki theater, which composed movement in a simultaneously fragmented but hierarchal fashion. More frequently, however, dominants took overt and singular form. In ''Man with a Movie Camera'', Vertov constructs one sequence- scarcely definable as a "scene"- through the dominant movement of circularity, displaying industrial threading machines and human movements that performed circularly.
** ''Secondary/Subordinate'' – The elements or stimuli that support and highlight the dominant. In film, as in music, these create a harmony between and through shots. Without secondary/subordinate stimuli, the internal shot structure lacked the requisite dialectical composition necessary for Socialist Realism's revolutionary form. Eisenstein asserted that competing and complementary secondary stimuli were useful in conjuring particular psychic responses from the audience. Overtonal analysis of sound in ''The General Line'', for example, reveals that there is an "orchestral counterpoint" to almost every shot, coaxing a texture from the film, rather than a purely visual or aural experience.&lt;ref name="Eisenstein 17"/&gt;
* ''Theme'' – The generalizable content of a film. Here, we draw primarily from Vsevolod Pudovkin's work in ''Film Technique'', in which he argues that the foundational work of montage is realized by first determining a theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pudovkin's Films And Film Theory|last = Dart|first = Peter|publisher = Arno Press|year = 1974|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Eisenstein, Pudovkin believed that all necessary elements in recognizing a theme must be evident in a single shot rather than a collision of shots. The catch, however, is that the phenomenon chosen to represent a theme should be shot from different angles and perspectives in order to portray the "superficial and the profound interrelationships of actuality". Theme is not, however, a matter of spectatorial interpretation. Rather, it is meant to arrive organically at the conclusion of a given film due exclusively to the control wielded by the director.&lt;ref&gt;Dart, Peter. pg. 93&lt;/ref&gt; In a mild critique of DW Griffith's ''Intolerance'', Pudovkin advocated for a shortening of the film (3 hours and 30 minutes) in order to crystallize and condense the film's theme. As it was presented, Griffith's film dilutes its own political potential by attempting create visual themes from non-phenomenological concepts. Instead, as Pudovkin elaborated, a filmmaker should choose concepts that are depictable in images rather than language.
** ''Analysis'' takes place when a theme is explored from sufficient perspectives. Analysis is derived by examination of individual shots, but is only relevant when synthesized. Peter Dart, in his description of Pudovkin's concept of analysis, defines it.

{{quote|An object or an event becomes "vivid and effective" on the screen only when the necessary details are correctly found and arranged [...] Pudovkin referred to a hypothetical street demonstration. An actual observer of a demonstration can get only one point of view at a time. To a get a broad view he would have to climb to the roof of a building adjacent to the demonstration, but then he might not be able to read the banners. If he mingled with the crowd he could only see a small portion of the demonstration. A filmmaker, however, can photograph the demonstration from several different points of view and edit the shots to present the spectator with a view of the demonstration, which transforms from a "spectator" into an "observer".&lt;ref&gt;Dart, Peter. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;}}
** Identification is the capacity for the audience to fully comprehend the theme of a film. Pudovkin was concerned here with the capacity for spectators to follow his films and hedged against breaks in continuity. As such, identification was mainly concerned with calculating a consistent theme structure and making sure images were smoothly shot and seamlessly edited. Pudovkin achieved both of these tasks by "[cutting] on action", or editing shots together through a unified movement.&lt;ref&gt;Pudovkin, ''Film Technique'' p. 106-7&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Affect, Emotion and Pathos'' – Often used interchangeably by many Soviet filmmakers and theorists, these are the impressions felt by a(n) audience/spectator from a film or parts of a film. The central problem of Eisenstein's book ''Nonindifferent Nature'' is the relationship between pathos/affect and the method by which art coaxes it. In the chapter ''On the Structure of Things'', Eisenstein begins with the supposition that represented phenomena depict material elements which explicates a system of structuration between those elements and the phenomena itself. The composition of music is a case-in-point. From the emotional affect of verbalized speech comes the tonal and rhythmic qualities expressed in a given composition. Cinematography generates a similar relational dialectic with images and referents, and through the logic of montage. In short, when one structures the succession of images by its emotional referent, the result is affective moving images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nonindifferent Nature|last = Eisenstein|first = Sergei|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organic unity of ''Battleship Potemkin'', for example, sustains particular pathos in particular instances. In the "Odessa Steps" scene, dramatic tension rises not from individuated elements, but the organization of elements (shots, composition, lighting, etc.) from natural model of tension. This model, from which Eisenstein theorizes all forms of organic growth and unity, is that of a logarithmic spiral. This spiral, in which the smaller point corresponds to its larger counterpoint in the same ratio that the larger point corresponds to the figure as whole, explains organic growth within nature, the relations of parts to evolutionary growth, and the process by which transformation takes place.  Platonic scholars and art theorists have identified this spiral and formula as a central figure of classical beauty. It can located in classical architecture and painting, as well as contemporary photographic composition (the rule of thirds). For Eisenstein, the capacity for a film (or any art, but specifically "plastic arts") to work affectively/emotionally, organic unity must be achieved, the growth of its constituent parts resembling the logarithmic spiral. When organic unity is realized, one can observe clear pathos. Eisenstein defines pathos as "...what forces the viewer to jump out of his seat. It is what forces him to flee from his place. It is what forces him to clap, to cry out. It is what forces his eyes to gleam with ecstasy before tears of ecstasy appear in them. In word, it is everything that forces the viewer to "be beside himself".&lt;ref&gt;Nonindifferent Nature p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; In the "Odessa Steps" scene, the collision of contrary movements- e.g. up and down stairs, from many guns to one muzzle- exemplifies an organic growth concept, and is informed by the pathos of the shooting; one of horror. The ex stasis (out of a state) is observed in viewers who trace the logic of organic unity- the compositional and narrative growth of the scene- to its foundational pathos. The affective pay-off is a synthesis of a spectator's experience with the radicalized representations on the screen.

In ''The General Line'' (referred in the text as ''The Old and the New'') the pathos of the milk separator is localized in order to examine the (in)voluntary contamination of pathos by themes and supposedly neutral elements. Like ''Potemkin'', ''The General Line'' invoked the theme of "collective unity" within a community.&lt;ref name="Nonindifferent 46"&gt;''Nonindifferent Nature'' p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; "And all this because the scheme 'of a chain reaction'- buildup of intensity- explosion- leaps from explosion to explosion- gives a clearer structural picture of the leaps from one state to another, characteristic for the ecstasy of particulars accumulating into the pathos of the whole."&lt;ref name="Nonindifferent 46"/&gt; However, a number of factors separate the scenes' pathos. The use of a new 28-inch lens allowed for a simultaneous splitting and unifying effect in The General Line. Also, milk's transformation to cream was a metaphorical device used to stand-in for the peasants' own transformation. These, and other examples, illustrate that pathos, as determined by exterior features, is incomplete. Rather, pathos and emotion were self-determined and intrinsic to form. The example of several painterly renderings of Christ's expulsion of the moneylenders and his eventual resurrection demonstrate a consistent pathos, despite different artists and moments. This suggests a parallel "inner discovery" process embedded in thematic works. Finally, Eisenstein identifies the dialectical process as the precipitating force for unearthing pathos. "The law of construction of processes- the basis of their form- in these cases will be identical. The effectiveness of the results in the norms of each area is equally 'transported beyond the limits' of these norms and the areas themselves as well. The actual processes- according to the same formula of ex stasis- is 'being beside oneself'. And this formula is nothing but the moment (instant) of the culmination of the dialecti law of transition of quantity into quality[...]The areas of application are different. But the stages are identical. The nature of the effects achieved is different. But the 'formulas' at the basis of these highest stages of manifestation, independent of the areas themselves, are identical."&lt;ref&gt;''Nonindifferent Nature'', p. 198-99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods ===
* '''Attractions''' – The montage of attractions asserts that an audience is moved emotionally, psychically, and politically by sudden bursts of aggressive movement. Eisenstein adapted this theory from the Proletkult to the cinema in his 1923 essay The Montage of Attractions. Attractions are a molecular unit of a theatrical whole that is independent of narrative and setting. In his 1924 essay The Montage of Film Attractions, Eisenstein makes explicit linkage of film and theater through a common audience. Here, an attraction is "...any demonstrable fact (an action, an object, a phenomenon, a conscious combination, and so on) that is known and proven to exercise a definite effect on the attention and emotions of the audience and that, combined with others, possess the characteristics of concentrating the audience's emotions in any direction dictated by the production's purpose."&lt;ref&gt;''Eisenstein Reader'', pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; The intent was to ground attractions in revolutionary ideology in order coax the audience into a sympathetic position.
* '''Metric''' – where the editing follows a specific number of frames (based purely on the physical nature of time), cutting to the next shot no matter what is happening within the image.  This montage is used to elicit the most basal and emotional of reactions in the audience. Metric montage was based on the absolute length of shots. The schema of connection is based on the necessity of rapidity. Eisenstein clarifies its implementation by comparing it to beat structures in music, which dictates that structures that fail to follow the "law of prime numbers (relationships)" are incapable of causing any physiological effect. He favors, instead, very basic and simple beat structures (3:4, 2:4, 1:4).&lt;ref&gt;''Eisenstein Reader'', p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;
** [http://www.tcf.ua.edu/Classes/Jbutler/T112/EditingIllustrations02.htm Metric montage example] from Eisenstein's [[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|''October'']].
* '''Rhythmic''' – Rhythmic montage seeks an editorial and compositional relationship in which movements within frames are as important as lengths of shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/330034|title=Film form; essays in film theory,|last=Sergei|first=Eisenstein|date=|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|others=Leyda, Jay, 1910–1988,|year=1949|isbn=0156309203|edition=[1st ed.]|location=New York,|pages=73|oclc=330034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity that was cautioned against for metric montage is praised for rhythmic. Since the content of the shot is a dominant element of the shot length, the ascending or descending meter of the shots makes intuitive visual sense.
** [http://classes.yale.edu/film/videos/ryth-good.wmv Rhythmic montage example] from ''[[The Good The Bad and the Ugly]]'' where the [[protagonist]] and the two [[antagonist]]s face off in a three-way duel

* '''Tonal''' – a tonal montage uses the emotional meaning of the shots—not just manipulating the temporal length of the cuts or its rhythmical characteristics—to elicit a reaction from the audience even more complex than from the metric or rhythmic montage.  For example, a sleeping baby would emote calmness and relaxation.
** [https://web.archive.org/web/20120207102817/http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/98-99/9505060m/sounds/mourn.mov Tonal example] from Eisenstein's ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''. This is the clip following the death of the revolutionary sailor Vakulinchuk, a martyr for sailors and workers.
* '''Overtonal/Associational''' – the overtonal montage is the cumulation of metric, rhythmic, and tonal montage to synthesize its effect on the audience for an even more abstract and complicated effect.
** [http://www.tcf.ua.edu/Classes/Jbutler/T112/EditingIllustrations05.htm Overtonal example] from Pudovkin's ''Mother''. In this clip, the men are workers walking towards a confrontation at their factory, and later in the movie, the [[protagonist]] uses ice as a means of escape.[http://amicus.collectionscanada.ca/aaweb-bin/aamain/itemdisp?sessionKey=999999999_142&amp;l=0&amp;d=2&amp;v=0&amp;lvl=1&amp;itm=25787857].
* '''Intellectual''' – uses shots which, combined, elicit an intellectual meaning.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071110162540/http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/98-99/9505060m/objects/intellectual.htm] Intellectual montage seeks to use few images, but images that are rich in cultural, symbolic, and political history. Their collision brings about complex concepts that traditional montage could not achieve. It was at this time (1929) that Eisenstein sought to distance filmmaking from an adherence to positivist realism. Intellectual montage sought to present things not as they were, but as they functioned in society. In his examination of Japanese and Chinese language, Eisenstein determined a linguistic link between language and montage. Hieroglyphs endemic to either country's language were highly contextual. The combination of two characters created concepts, but when separated were neutral. The example Eisenstein gives is the combination of the symbols 'eye' and 'water' produce the concept 'crying'. This logic was extended to Japanese Kabuki theater, which used a montage technique of acting, wherein parts of the body were moved in relation and collision to the whole and other parts of the body. Film, similarly, could collide objects within the frame just as readily as it could between frames. Intellectual montage seeks to capitalize on an internal frame as well as the composition and content of the image itself, without sacrificing a dialectical approach, which Eisenstein ultimately concluded was the downfall of Japanese cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein Reader, pp. 82–92&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual montage was most notably used as a productive model in Eisenstein's The General Line (1929). Here, dominants- shots and elements within the shot that mark the schema of all adjacent shots and elements- are not foregrounded, but delayed in an attempt to mimic musical resonance. Resonances are secondary stimuli that help to highlight the dominant. It is here that one should note the understandable conflation of overtonal and intellectual montage. In fact, overtonal montage is a kind of intellectual montage, since both attempt to elicit complex ideas from the collision of cinematic stimulants.
** [https://tcf.ua.edu/Classes/Jbutler/T112/EditingIllustrations06.php Intellectual montage examples] from Eisenstein's [[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|''October'']] and [[Strike (1925 film)|''Strike'']]. In ''Strike'', a shot of striking workers being attacked cut with a shot of a bull being slaughtered creates a film metaphor suggesting that the workers are being treated like cattle. This meaning does not exist in the individual shots; it only arises when they are juxtaposed.
** At the end of ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' the execution of Colonel Kurtz is juxtaposed with the villagers' ritual slaughter of a water buffalo.
* '''Vertical''' montage focuses on the a single shot or moment, rather than across (horizontal) various shots. Indelibly, vertical montage provides a closer reading of images and their content, as well as permits non-visual phenomena to be considered alongside the image proper.
** ''Moving Camera'' – A dynamic rather than static camera is often used for the same effect as editing. Though not expressly a form of montage, since editing isn't required, a moving camera can cover movement across space continuously. Dynamic action, in which characters or objects move across protracted distances, was the motivating factor in choosing to move the camera. Peter Dart identifies relatively few uses of a moving camera in his analysis of Pudovkin's ''Mother'' (1926), ''The End of St. Petersburg'' (1928), ''Storm Over Asia'' (1928), and Eisenstein's ''Battleship Potemkin'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;Dart, Peter. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; In all of these films and scenes, the moving camera captures movement. One reason for so few moving shots was that it provided undue continuity and forfeited the discontinuity demanded by the dialectical method of montage.&lt;ref&gt;Pudovkin, ''Film Technique'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Moving camera and mise en scene culminates in what we call the "Inner Montage".
** ''Audio/Visual'' – The synaesthetic mode, characterised by a total sensory analysis of film, transforms montage from a purely visual category to one incorporating visual and audio elements. This theory's foundation can be seen in Eisenstein's essay "The Fourth Dimension in Cinema", in which Japanese Kabuki Theater and Haiku are examined as in their fragmented totality. Leonard C. Pronko connects Eisenstein's sensory analysis to a formalized synaesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theater East And West; Perspectives Toward A Total Theater|last = Pronko|first = Leonard Cabell|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1967|isbn = |location = Berkeley|pages = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication was threefold. First, this grounded montage theory within a non-western language, which gave credibility to Montage Theory as a universal principle. Second, as Steve Odin illustrates, it provided an opening for Japanese art and culture to be examined within a modern context.&lt;ref&gt;Odin, Steve. pp. 69–81&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the integration of other senses into the theory of montage laid the groundwork for Montage Theory's persistence throughout historical and technological changes in cinema.

== Intellectual montage ==

In his later writings, Eisenstein argues that montage, especially intellectual montage, is an alternative system to [[continuity editing]]. He argued that "Montage is conflict" (dialectical) where new ideas, emerge from the collision of the montage sequence (synthesis) and where the new emerging ideas are not innate in any of the images of the edited sequence. A new concept explodes into being. His understanding of montage, thus, illustrates Marxist dialectics.

Concepts similar to intellectual montage would arise during the first half of the 20th century, such as [[Imagism]] in poetry (specifically [[Pound's Ideogrammic Method]]), or [[Cubism|Cubism's]] attempt at synthesizing multiple perspectives into one painting. The idea of associated concrete images creating a new (often abstract) image was an important aspect of much early [[Modernism|Modernist]] art.

Eisenstein relates this to non-literary "writing" in pre-literate societies, such as the ancient use of pictures and images in sequence, that are therefore in "conflict". Because the pictures are relating to each other, their collision creates the meaning of the "writing". Similarly, he describes this phenomenon as [[dialectical materialism]].

Eisenstein argued that the new meaning that emerged from conflict is the same phenomenon found in the course of historical events of social and revolutionary change. He used intellectual montage in his feature films (such as ''Battleship Potemkin'' and ''October'') to portray the political situation surrounding the [[Bolshevik Revolution]].

He also believed that intellectual montage expresses how everyday thought processes happen. In this sense, the montage will in fact form thoughts in the minds of the viewer, and is therefore a powerful tool for propaganda.

Intellectual montage follows in the tradition of the ideological Russian [[Proletcult Theatre]] which was a tool of political agitation. In his film ''Strike'', Eisenstein includes a sequence with cross-cut editing between the slaughter of a bull and police attacking workers. He thereby creates a film metaphor: assaulted workers = slaughtered bull. The effect that he wished to produce was not simply to show images of people's lives in the film but more importantly to shock the viewer into understanding the reality of their own lives. Therefore, there is a revolutionary thrust to this kind of film making.

Eisenstein discussed how a perfect example of his theory is found in his film ''October'', which contains a sequence where the concept of "God" is connected to class structure, and various images that contain overtones of political authority and divinity are edited together in descending order of impressiveness so that the notion of God eventually becomes associated with a block of wood. He believed that this sequence caused the minds of the viewer to automatically reject all political class structures.

== Counter theories and criticism ==
Though montage was widely acknowledged in principle as the mechanism that constitutes cinema, it was not universally believed as cinema's essence. Lev Kuleshov, for example, expressed that though montage makes cinema possible, it does not hold as much significance as performance, a type of internal montage. Additionally, Kuleshov expressed the subservience of montage to the will of those who deploy it.&lt;ref&gt;Kuleshov, ''Kuleshov on Film'', p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; In his comparisons between Russian, European, and American cinema prior to the Russian Revolution, Kuleshov could not identify a unifying theory between them and concluded a relativistic approach to filmmaking, opting for something similar to later auteur theories. The implication of an exclusive focus on montage is one in which performances become unconvincing given the actors jilted belief in his/her own significance.

Kino-eye, composed of various newsreel correspondents, editors, and directors, also took indirect aim at montage as the overarching principle of cinema. Kino-eye was interested in capturing life of the proletariat and actualizing revolution, and was accused by Eisenstein of being devoid of ideological method. Films like Dziga Vertov's ''The Man with a Movie Camera'' utilized montage (almost all films did at the time), but packaged images without discernible political connection between shots. Vertov, on the other hand, saw the fictional revolutions represented in Eisenstein's films as lacking the visceral weight of unscripted action.

== Other Soviet film theories and practices ==

=== Socialist Realism ===
Socialist Realism speaks to the project of art within Stalin's period. Art, inherently implosive when funded and regulated by the state, requires form and content to avoid neutrality. The five-year plan, which demanded workers to "overfill the plan" required filmmakers to exceed baseline standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pudovkin, Socialist Realism, And The Classical Hollywood Style|last = Kepley Jr.|first = Vance|date = 1995|journal = Journal of Film &amp; Video|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalism, in which art can only express its subject singularly rather than relationally, is incapable of exposing the structural and systemic characteristics of phenomena. Realism, on the other hand, is concerned with relationships, causality, and the production of informed spectators. As such, Socialist Realism was primarily a literary movement, characterized by works such as Maxim Gorky's novel ''Mother''. Filmmakers took cues from their literary counterparts, implementing a narrative and character style reminiscent of communist cultural values. Below are some factors that influenced the cinematic Socialist Realist approach.
* ''Synchronized sound'' was a contentious issue with Soviet film theorist. Pudovkin railed against its use given its capacity for commodification within capitalist society and, primarily, its propensity to move film toward naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;Dart, Peter. p.137&lt;/ref&gt; In his reasoning, since sync sound was conditioned to the image, it could only lend itself toward enhanced continuity. Continuity, a process that mitigates the dialectical collision of concepts, would dilute the radical potential of films. Further, any dialectical potential for sound had already been explored in cinema, since musical accompaniment had a well established history by the time synchronized sound had been introduced. However, Pudovkin later reversed his position on sync-sound. Joining Eisenstein and others, Pudovkin came to understand sound not a complementary, but as a counterpoint capable of imbuing films with additional conflictual elements. The inherent tension between this position and the State's mandate for narrative clarity and continuity would be a source of confusion and stagnation for much of this period. Kino-eye took the problem of sound from a documentary/newsreel perspective. In the essays ''Let's Discuss Ukrainfilm's First Sound Film: Symphony of the Donbas'' (1931) and ''First Steps'' (1931) Vertov identifies and dismantles the technical, logistical and political hurdles to sync-sound in newsreel cinema. By using his film ''Enthusiasm'' (1931), Vertov demonstrated that sound was not only possible, but essential to the evolution of newsreel. Vertv writes
{{quote|And finally, the most important observation. When, in ''Enthusiasm'', the industrial sounds of the All-Union Stokehold arrive at the square, filling the streets with their machine music to accompany the gigantic festive parades; when on the other hand, the sounds of military bands, of parades [...] fuse with the sounds of the machines, the sounds of competing factory shops; when the work of bridging the gape in the Donbas passes before us as an endless "Communist Sabbath", as "the days of industrialization", as a red star, red banner campaign. We must view this not as a shortcoming, but as a serious, ''long-range experiment''.&lt;ref&gt;Vertov p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* ''Narration'' – Story clarity was an overriding principle of [[Socialist realism|Socialist Realist]] filmmaking, grounding it in accessibility to a wide array of spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Kepley Jr. p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vance Kepley Jr., this was a response to the emerging belief that early montage films unnecessarily confined cinema's appeal to highly competent film audiences rather than a general public.&lt;ref&gt;Kepley Jr., p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Hollywood's influence'' – Over the course of the 1930s, the shift toward Socialist Realism became Party policy and was modeled after Hollywood's popularity with the general public. Ironically, the continuity style that had been the divergent point for Montage Theorists asserted itself as the paramount editing technique of the new Soviet filmmaking mandate. Kepley, in a case study regarding Pudovkin's ''The Return of Vasilii Bortnikov'' (1953), explains the narrative, editorial, and compositional influence Hollywood had over Soviet Realist filmmaking at the time. In short, not only did Pudovkin willingly amend the concept of montage to exclude an intellect-centric model to suit audience reception, but was also under strict regulation to meet the Stalinist standard of Socialist Realism that came to define the 1940s and 1950s. Such strict regulation, combined with the presumptive Hollywood model, ultimately led to a dearth of films produced in the subsequent decades in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Kepley Jr., pp 3–12&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kino-eye ===
Kinoks ("cinema-eye men") / Kinoglaz ("Kino-eye") – The group and movement founded by Dziga Vertov. The Council of Three was the official voice of Kino-eye, issuing statements on the group's behalf. The demands, elaborated in films, conferences, and future essays, would seek to situate Kino-eye as the preeminent Soviet filmmaking collective. In the Art of the Cinema, Kuleshov issues a challenge to non-fiction filmmakers: "Ideologues of the non-fictional film!- give up convincing yourselves of the correctness of your viewpoints: they are indisputable. Create or point out methods of creating genuine, exciting newsreels. ... When it is possible to film easily and comfortably, without having to consider either location, or the light conditions, then the authentic flowering of the non-fictional film will take place, depicting our environment, our construction, our land."&lt;ref&gt;Kuleshov on Film, p. 122-23&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Manifesto''' – In their introductory statement ''We: Variant of a Manifesto'' (1922), Vertov lays the groundwork for Kino-eye's interpretation of cinema and the role of each component of the cinematic apparatus (producer, spectator, exhibit). The manifesto demanded:
** The death of cinematography "so that the art of cinema may live." Their objection, spelled out in "To Cinematographers – The Council of Three", criticised the old guard of holding to prerevolutionary models which had ceased their useful function. Routine, rooted in the rote reliance on a six-act psychodrama, had doomed film to stagnation. In ''The Resolution of the Council of Three,'' April 10, 1923, Kino-eye identified newsreel as the necessary correction to devolution of film practice. 
** The purity of cinema and its undue conflation with other art forms. Here, they are combating a premature synthesis of forms. Theater, which had long been the center of revolutionary art, was condemned for its desperate integration of elemental objects and labors in order to stay relevant. Film, and more specifically newsreel, encountered life as it happened and created synthesis from life, rather than an assemblage of representational objects that approach but never capture life.
** The exclusion of man as a subject for film and toward a poetry of machines. In a follow up to The Resolution of the Council of Three, April 10, 1923, Kino-eye published an excerpt decrying American cinema's reliance on humanness as a benchmark for filmmaking, rather than treating the camera as an eye itself. "We cannot improve the making of our eyes, but we can endlessly perfect the camera." The reproduction of human perception was the implicit project of film until this point, which Kino-eye saw as a hamstrung endeavor for cinema. Rather than assume the position of humanness, Kino-eye sought to breakdown movement in its intricacies, thereby liberating cinema from bodily limitations and providing the basis from which montage could fully express itself.
** The determination and essence of systems of movement. Analyzing movement was a step in the reconstitution of the body and the machine. "I am kino-eye, I create a man more perfect than Adam, I create thousands of different people in accordance with preliminary blueprints and diagrams of different kinds. I am kino-eye. From one person I take the hands, the strongest and most dexterous; from another I take the legs, the swiftest and most shapely; from a third, the most beautiful and expressive head- and through montage I create a new, perfect man. I am kino-eye, I am a mechanical eye. I, a machine, show you the world as only I can see it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kino-Eye : The Writings Of Dziga Vertov|last = Vertov|first = Dziga|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1984|isbn = |location = Berkeley|pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Radio-pravda''' was an attempt to record sounds of life. Vertov published ''Kinopravda'' &amp; ''Radiopravda'' in 1925. In the service of capturing average life, the sounds of life was left unaccounted for in cinema. The integration of audio-visual technologies had already taken place by the time Kino-eye published its statement. The intent was to fully integrate both technologies to be broadcast to a worldwide proletariat audience. "We must prepare to turn these inventions of the capitalist world to its own destruction. We will not prepare for the broadcast of operas and dramas. We will prepare wholeheartedly to give the workers of every land the opportunity to see and hear the whole world in an organized form; to see, hear, and understand one another."&lt;ref&gt;Vertov, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Critique of Art''' – Art, as conceptualized in various essays but most explicitly in ''Kino-Eye'' (Vertov, 1926), confronts fiction as "Stupefaction and suggestion…"&lt;ref name="Vertov 63"&gt;Vertov, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to critique was thought to reside exclusively within realistic documentation alone. As such, art-drama's weakness was its inability to excite protest; its danger the capacity to deceive like "hypnosis".&lt;ref name="Vertov 63"/&gt; Kino-eye believed that the illusion created by art-drama could only be combated by consciousness. In section 3, ''Very Simple Slogans'' of the ''Kino-Eye'' essay, Vertov details the following axioms of Kinoks:
** "Film-drama is the opium of the people.
** Down with the immortal kings and queens of the screen! Long live the ordinary mortal, filmed in life at his daily tasks!
** Down with the bourgeois fairy-tale script! Long live life as it is!
** Film-drama and religion are deadly weapons in the hands of capitalists. By showing our revolutionary way of life, we will wrest that weapon from the enemy's hands.
** The contemporary artistic drama is a vestige of the old world. It is an attempt to pour our revolutionary reality into bourgeois molds.
** Down with the staging of everyday life! Film us as we are.
** The scenario is a fairy tale invented for us by a writer. We live our own lives, and we do not submit to anyone's fictions.
** Each of us does his task in life and does not prevent anyone else from working. The film workers' task is to film us so as not to interfere with our work.
** Long live the kino-eye of proletarian revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Vertov, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Constructivism and Kino-eye''' – Though Vertov considered himself a constructivist, his practices and those of Aleskei Gan, perhaps the most vocal of the movement, diverged. Gan and other constructivists took the statements of the Kino-Eye essay to be a fundamental misunderstanding of the worker's purpose and usefulness. While Vertov understood the labor of art to be culprit of mass illusion, to Gan, ''artistic labor'' was a highly valuable endeavor with which workers could ultimately dismantle ''artistry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Labor Demonstrations: Aleksei Gan's "Island Of The Young Pioneers," Dziga Vertov's "Kino-Eye," And The Rationalization Of Artistic Labor|last = Romberg|first = Kristin|date = 2013|journal = October|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Constructivism does not strive to create new types of art. It develops forms of artistic labor through which workers can actually enter into artistic labor without losing touch with their material labor. ... Revolutionary Constructivism wrenches photography and cinematography from the hands of art-makers. Constructivism digs art's grave."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Konstruktivizm mogil'shchik iskusstva|last = Gan|first = Aleskei|date = March 1924|journal = Zrelishcha|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gan's film ''Island of the Young Pioneers'' follows a community of children who live self-sustaining lives in the countryside. The film, lost or destroyed over time, was produced in the hope of marrying artistic performance and reality in a way that meets the standards of Party leadership and the Socialist Realist movement. The result was a productive process that mirrored the summer camps already enjoyed by many Russian youth of the time. The camera captured Gan's ability to elicit performance as a ''practice'' not a ''product''.

"Above all, I constructed a true cinema-object not on top of everyday life, but out of everyday life. The story offered by comrade Verevkin's script did not weigh life down in my work. Instead, the everyday life of the Young Pioneers absorbed the story, making it possible to capture the essence of the young Leninists in their spontaneous actuality [or immediate reality, neposredstvennoi deistvitel'nosti]. This materialist approach freed us from art cinema's bourgeois illustration of a literary text, overcame the "government-issue" formalism of the newsreel, and allowed us to productively establish devices for filming with a socialist character."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Da zdravstvuet demonstratsiia byta|last = Gan|first = Aleskei|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristin Romberg mediates the conflictual but parallel nature of Kino-eye and Gan's constructivism by identifying empathy as the central dividing element. ''Island of the Young Pioneers'' enters into a role-playing relationship between and with children that seeks to build an understanding between them. This, along with the focus on radicalizing children specifically, was inconceivable within Kino-eye's framework. Vertov, concerned with machinery, movement and labor, universalized Kino-eye's strategy of constant critique, with little room for empathy and nuance.

== "The Dramaturgy of Film Form" ("The Dialectical Approach of Film Form") ==
In this essay, Eisenstein explicates how art is created and sustained through a dialectical process. He begins with this supposition:

{{quote|According to Marx and Engels the system of the dialectic is only the conscious reproduction of the dialectical course (essence) of the external events of the world. (Razumovsky, The Theory of Historical Materialism, Moscow, 1928)

Thus:

the projection of the dialectical system of objects into the brain

-into abstraction creation-

-into thought-

produces dialectical modes of thought- dialectical materialism-

PHILOSOPHY

Similarly:

the projection of the same system of objects- in concrete creation- in form- produces

ART

The basis of this philosophy is the dynamic conception of objects: being as a constant evolution from the interaction between two contradictory opposites. Synthesis that evolves from the opposition between thesis and antithesis. It is equally of basic importance for the correct conception of art and all art forms.

In the realm of art this dialectical principle of the dynamic is embodied in

CONFLICT

as the essential basic principle of the existence of every work of art and every form.&lt;ref&gt;''Eisenstein Reader'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From this, the form an art takes grants it its dialectical and political dimension. The material from which it is created is inherently conflictual and holds the seeds of its own destruction (antithesis). Without this understanding, montage is merely a succession of images reminiscent of DW Griffith's continuity editing. Here, it is important to note that, for Eisenstein, art form is inherently political. The danger is in claiming it's neutral until a story or interpretation are attached. While theories of montage prior to this sought political mobilization, Dramaturgy took montage beyond the cinema and implicated film form in broader Marxist struggle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3764">'''Spectromorphology''' is the perceived sonic footprint of a [[Frequency spectrum#Sound|sound spectrum]] as it manifests in [[time]]. A descriptive spectromorphological analysis of sound is sometimes used in the analysis of [[electroacoustic music]], especially [[acousmatic music]]. The term was coined by [[Denis Smalley]] in 1986 and is considered the most adequate English term to designate the field of sound research associated with the French writer, composer, and academic, [[Pierre Schaeffer]]  {{citation needed| reason=This claim doesn't fully explain the connection with Shaeffer's work neither by who this term is considered relevant to understand the research initiated by Schaeffer's work|date=January 2015}}.

Schaeffer's work at [[Groupe de Recherches Musicales#Groupe de Recherches Musicales|INA/GRM]] in Paris, beginning in the late 1940s, culminated in the publication of the book [[Musique concrète#Trait.C3.A9 des Objets Musicaux|Traité des objets musicaux]] in 1966. Smalley's notion of spectromorphology builds upon Schaeffer's theories relating to the use of a classification system for various categories of sound.&lt;ref&gt;(Thoresen:2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalley's term refers to the descriptive analysis of perceived morphological developments in sound spectra over time, and it implies that the "spectro" cannot exist without the [[Morphological typology|morphology]]: something has to be shaped and that something must have sonic content (Smalley, 1986, 1997).

==Theoretical framework==
The theoretical framework of spectro-morphology is articulated mainly in four parts: 
* the [[typology (statistics)|typology]] of the spectra
* morphology
* motion
* structuring processes.

===Spectral typologies===
Smalley defines three different spectral typologies that exist in what he calls the noise-note [[continuum (theory)|continuum]]. This continuum is subdivided into three principal elements: 
* the noise. 
* the node (an event having a more complex texture than a single pitch).
* the note, which is in turn subdivided into note, harmonic spectrum and inharmonic spectrum.

===Morphological archetypes===
Smalley also designates different morphological [[archetype]]s:
* attack-impulse. Modeled on the single detached note: a sudden onset which is immediately terminated. In this instance the attack-onset is also the termination. 
* attack-decay (closed and open) - modeled on sounds in which the attack-onset is extended by a [[resonance]] that quickly or gradually decays towards termination. The closed form represents a quick decay which is strongly attack-determined. The open form reflects a more gradual decay where the ear is drawn away from the formative influence of the attack into the continuing behaviour of the sound on its way to termination. 
* graduated continuant - Modeled on sustained sounds. The onset is graduated, settling into a [[continuant]] phase which eventually closes in a graduated termination. The onset is perceived as a much less formative influence than in the other two archetypes. Attention is drawn to the way in which the sound is maintained rather than to its initiation.

The '''Spiritualists' National Union''' ('''SNU''') is a [[Spiritualist]] organisation, founded in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1901, and is one of the largest spiritualist groups in the world. Its motto is ''Light, Nature, Truth''.

Over its history, it has organised test cases regarding the legal status of spiritualist mediums, with regard to such matters as exemption from [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|compulsory military National service]].  In legal terms, spiritualist mediums were considered to violate such laws as the [[Vagrancy Act 1824]], which outlawed [[fortune telling]], and the [[Witchcraft Act 1735]]. The Union campaigned against these laws for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = High Court of Justice. King's Bench Division. Spiritualists and Military Service. Oaten vs. Anty | work = [[The Times]] | pages = 6 | date = April 8, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = News in Brief | work = [[The Times]] | pages = 13 | date = July 5, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Spiritualists and the Law: Mr Morrison's Statement | work = [[The Times]] | pages = 2 | date = December 16, 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Spiritualists and the Witchcraft Act | work = [[The Times]] | pages = 2 | date = July 20, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were eventually repealed by the [[Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951]], which legalised the practice of mediums unless it was shown that they were profiting financially from a fraudulent service. This act was repealed in April 2008, and fraudulent mediums are now covered by consumer protection legislation, namely The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/spiritualism/history/history.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also performed more everyday services, such as organising war memorial services in the wake of the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = News in Advertisements | work = [[The Times]] | pages = 9 | date = April 17, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 there was some controversy surrounding the removal of Kevin West, the then leader of Waterloo spiritualist church. After the church removed West from his position in 2001, he refused to step down, igniting a conflict that saw both sides changing locks to keep each other out of the building before eventually losing the dispute in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Spiritualist+leader+is+stripped+of+his+title.-a089416667 Spiritualist leader is stripped of his title]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Union later organised educational courses in spiritualism-related subjects, and has participated in scientific research into mediumship.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In 1995 the SNU acquired the publication ''[[Psychic News]]'', which it ran until it was closed in July 2011, later reopening under different ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stemman |first=Roy |title=Death of 'Psychic News'? |date=Jul 10, 2010 |url=http://paranormalreview.com/articles/20100710 |work=Roy Stemman's Paranormal Review |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403145520/http://www.paranormalreview.com/articles/20100710|archivedate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mission Statement and Goals'''
In 2000 the SNU adopted the following mission statement:

To Promote the Religion and Religious Philosophy of Spiritualism as based upon The Seven Principles

It also re-defined its goals as:

*To procure perfect religious equality
*To assist in the formation of new Societies and Churches
*To strengthen the fraternal relations between Spiritualists
*To increase all classes of membership
*To print, publish and distribute literature
*To promote mission work
*To do all such lawful things as are for the advancement of Spiritualism

In the same year it began work on forming what is now called the Philosophy &amp; Ethics Committee. It was created following a series of complaints from members about the ethics of certain SNU Trust Investments. The issue was originally highlighted by an internet article about the use of what are termed "[http://www.waterloospiritualistchurch.com/BLOG&amp;SPATSUnethicalTrustInvestments.htm surplus funds]".

==History==
The SNU was founded on 18 October 1901 as the Association of the Spiritualists' National Union Ltd. In 1916, it campaigned to get government recognition for the religion of spiritualism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==The Seven Principles==

The Philosophy of SNU

Spiritualism is based upon seven principles. The Principles are not intended to be binding rules or the basis of a dogma but to provide a moral and ethical framework upon which people can base their lives.

'''1. The Fatherhood of God'''.
The core belief of the religious philosophy of Spiritualism is the acceptance of a Divine Energy. This force, whatever name given to it, has created all there is and sustains all its creation.
The ‘Spirit of God’ exists within and around everything. It is within all of us: we are all children of God so are part of one family. We acknowledge God as our Father.

'''2. The Brotherhood of Man'''.
We are all part of the universal creative force and therefore one family in God. The operation of true Brotherhood throughout the word would create betterment to the lives of many, bringing equality, security and peace. Spiritualists try to understand the needs of others and help all people regardless of race, colour or creed

'''3. The Communion of Spirits and the Ministry of Angels'''.
Communion with divine energy is a natural and essential part of existence. Communication between Spirit itself and its creations is an inbuilt ability. Spiritualists use this ability for communication directly, or via a medium, between those in the spirit world and ourselves. This is not supernatural; it is a normal activity. The main purpose of communication with the spirit world is to provide the evidence which supports our philosophy. The Ministry of Angels brings enhanced wisdom to enlighten the individual, society and the world in which we live. This includes those who are dedicated to the welfare and service of mankind bringing inspiration guidance and healing.

'''4. The Continuous Existence of the human soul'''.
Spirit is part of the ‘Creative Force’ and thus indestructible. Energy cannot be destroyed; it can only change its form. After death the physical body is left behind whilst the soul continues to exist in a different dimension that we call the spirit world. The individual personality continues unchanged by the event we call ‘death’.

'''5. Personal Responsibility'''.
In His wisdom, God has given us enormous potential; we can use that potential to improve our own lives and the lives of others. We have the ability to make decisions throughout our lives as we see fit. What each of us makes of our life is our Personal Responsibility no one can replace or override that right. No other person or influence can put right our wrongdoings.

'''6. Compensation and Retribution hereafter for all the good and evil deeds done on earth'''.
This Principle expresses the natural law of ‘cause and effect’. This law operates now, on earth, as well as in the spirit world. As we move through life making choices, the outcome of those choices affects our soul growth. When we leave this earthly life there will be no divine judgement. We will have the opportunity to reassess, take stock and decide what might have been done differently.

'''7. Eternal Progress open to every human soul'''.
Eternity does not begin at death; Progress is open to all now! Any action, or intent to change, to promote soul growth and progression, creates a positive reaction. There will always be the opportunity to develop and move forward, no one is ever deprived of the all embracing love of God.

These principles were the summary of faith of Emma Hardinge Britten, a pioneer for the UK's Spiritualist Movement and were adopted by the SNU. Emma was a medium and gifted orator and it was during her many speeches in trance state, that 'spirit communicators' gave various statements of faith. This resulted in the creation of the Seven Principles of Modern Spiritualism in the UK. Many believe that the influence of the 'spirit' of Socialist [[Robert Owen]] was paramount in this process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24908">'''Spread betting''' is any of various types of [[wagering]] on the [[outcome (game theory)|outcome]] of an event where the pay-off is based on the [[accuracy]] of the wager, rather than a simple "win or lose" outcome, such as [[fixed-odds betting|fixed-odds]] (or money-line) betting or [[parimutuel betting]].

A ''spread'' is a range of outcomes and the bet is whether the outcome will be above or below the spread. Spread betting has been a major growth market in the [[UK]] in recent years, with the number of gamblers heading towards one million.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sunday Times'': [http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/money/consumer_affairs/article673440.ece "World Cup to kick off boom in spread betting"]&lt;/ref&gt; Financial spread betting (see below) can carry a high level of risk if there is no "stop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The perils of spread-betting|url=https://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/leisure/article2493032.ece|work=The Times|date=Sep 20, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719193013/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/leisure/article2493032.ece|archivedate=July 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, spread betting is regulated by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] rather than the [[Gambling Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/|title=Gambling Commission - Home|website=www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The general purpose of spread betting is to create an active [[Market (economics)|market]] for both sides of a binary [[Scientific wager|wager]], even if the outcome of an event may appear ''[[prima facie]]'' to be [[bias]]ed towards one side or the other. In a [[sports|sporting]] event a strong team may be matched up against a historically weaker team; almost every game has a ''favorite'' and an ''underdog''. If the wager is simply "Will the favorite win?", more bets are likely to be made for the favorite, possibly to such an extent that there would be very few betters willing to take the underdog.

The point spread is essentially a handicap towards the underdog. The wager becomes "Will the favorite win by more than the point spread?" The point spread can be moved to any level to create an equal number of participants on each side of the wager. This allows a [[bookmaker]] to act as a [[market maker]] by accepting wagers on both sides of the spread. The bookmaker charges a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]], or ''[[vigorish]]'', and acts as the [[counterparty]] for each participant. As long as the total amount wagered on each side is roughly equal, the bookmaker is unconcerned with the actual outcome; [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] instead come from the commissions.

Because the spread is intended to create an equal number of wagers on either side, the implied probability is 50% for both sides of the wager. To profit, the bookmaker must pay one side (or both sides) less than this notional amount. In practice, spreads may be perceived as slightly favoring one side, and bookmakers often revise their odds to manage their event risk.

One important assumption is that to be credited with a win, either team only needs to win by the minimum of the rules of the game, without regard to the margin of victory. This implies that teams in a winning position will not necessarily try to extend their margin—and more importantly, each team is only playing to win rather than to beat the point spread. This assumption does not necessarily hold in all situations. For example, at the end of a season, the total points scored by a team can affect future events such as playoff seeding and positioning for the amateur draft, and teams may [[running up the score|"run up" the score]] in such situations. In virtually all sports, players and other on-field contributors are forbidden from being involved in sports betting and thus have no incentive to consider the point spread during play; any attempt to manipulate the outcome of a game for gambling purposes would be considered [[match fixing]], and the penalty is typically a lifetime banishment from the sport, such is the [[zero tolerance|lack of tolerance]] for gambling in sport.

==Spreads in sports wagering (U.S.)==
Spread betting was invented by [[Charles K. McNeil]], a mathematics teacher from [[Connecticut]] who became a bookmaker in [[Chicago]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Gambling Times: [http://iwon.gamblingtimes.com/writers/mcharles/mcharles_winter2001.html What are the Odds?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204005004/http://iwon.gamblingtimes.com/writers/mcharles/mcharles_winter2001.html |date=2011-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North America]], the gambler usually wagers that the difference between the scores of two teams will be less than or greater than the value specified by the [[bookmaker]]. An example:
* The bookmaker advertises a spread of '''4''' points in a certain game;
** If the gambler bets on the "[[underdog (competition)|underdog]]", they are said to ''take the points'' and will win if the underdog's score plus the spread is greater than the [[favorite]]'s score.
*** The eventual score is Underdog '''8''', Favorite '''10''': '''8''' + '''4''' &gt; '''10''', so the gambler wins;
*** The eventual score is Underdog '''8''', Favorite '''13''': '''8''' + '''4''' &lt; '''13''', so the gambler loses.
** If the gambler bets on the "favorite", they ''give the points'' (sometimes called ''lay the points'') and will win if the favorite's score minus the spread is greater than the underdog's score:
*** The eventual score is Underdog '''5''', Favorite '''10''': '''10''' – '''4''' &gt; '''5''', so the gambler wins;
*** The eventual score is Underdog '''8''', Favorite '''10''': '''10''' – '''4''' &lt; '''8''', so the gambler loses.
** Ties aka "Push"
*** The eventual score is Underdog '''9''', Favorite '''13''': '''9''' + '''4''' = '''13''', so the gambler ties "pushes". The reverse is also the same the gambler takes the favorite and it is '''13''' - '''4''' = '''9'''

Spreads are frequently, though not always, specified in half-point fractions to eliminate the possibility of a tie, known as a ''push''. In the event of a push, the game is considered ''no action'', and no money is won or lost. However, this is not a desirable outcome for the sports book, as they are forced to refund every bet, and although both the book and its bettors will be even, if the [[Transaction costs|cost of overhead]] is taken into account, the book has actually lost money by taking bets on the event. Sports books are generally permitted to state "ties win" or "ties lose" to avoid the necessity of refunding every bet.

Betting on sporting events has long been the most popular form of spread betting. Whilst most bets the casino offers to players have a built in house edge, betting on the spread offers an opportunity for the astute gambler. When a casino accepts a spread bet, it gives the player the odds of 10 to 11, or -110. That means that for every 11 dollars the player wagers, the player will win 10, slightly lower than an even money bet. If team A is playing team B, the casino is not concerned with who wins the game; they are only concerned with taking an equal amount of money of both sides. For example, if one player takes team A and the other takes team B and each wager $110 to win $100, it doesn’t matter what team wins; the casino makes money. They take $100 of the $110 from the losing bet and pay the winner, keeping the extra $10 for themselves. This is the house edge. The goal of the casino is to set a line that encourages an equal amount of action on both sides, thereby guaranteeing a profit. This also explains how money can be made by the astute gambler. If casinos set lines to encourage an equal amount of money on both sides, it sets them based on the public perception of the team, not necessarily the real strength of the teams. Many things can affect public perception, which moves the line away from what the real line should be. This gap between the Vegas line, the real line, and differences between other sports books betting lines and spreads is where value can be found.

A ''teaser'' is a bet that alters the spread in the gambler's favor by a predetermined margin – in [[American football]] the teaser margin is often six points. For example, if the line is 3.5 points and bettors want to place a teaser bet on the underdog, they take 9.5 points instead; a teaser bet on the favorite would mean that the gambler takes 2.5 points instead of having to give the 3.5. In return for the additional points, the payout if the gambler wins is less than [[even money]], or the gambler must wager on more than one event and both events must win. In this way it is very similar to a [[parlay (gambling)|parlay]]. At some establishments, the "reverse teaser" also exists, which alters the spread against the gambler, who gets paid at more than evens if the bet wins.

== Sports spread betting ==
Sports spread betting began in the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 1980s to offer an alternative form of sports wagering to traditional [[Fixed-odds betting|fixed odds]], or fixed-risk, betting. With [[fixed odds betting]], a gambler places a fixed-risk stake on stated fractional or decimal odds on the outcome of a sporting event that would give a known return for that outcome occurring or a known loss if that outcome doesn’t occur (the initial stake). With sports spread betting, gamblers are instead betting on whether a specified outcome in a sports event will end up being above or below a ‘spread’ offered by a sports spread betting firm, with profits or losses determined by how much above or below the spread the final outcome finishes at.

The spread on offer will refer to the betting firm’s prediction on the range of a final outcome for a particular occurrence in a sports event e.g. the total number of goals to be scored in a football match, the number of runs to be scored by a team in a cricket match or the number of lengths between the winner and second-placed finisher in a horse race.

The gambler can elect to ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ on the spread depending on whether they think the final outcome will be higher than the top end of the spread on offer, or lower than the bottom end of the spread. The more right the gambler is then the more they will win, but the more wrong they are then the more they can lose.

The level of the gambler’s profit or loss will be determined by the stake size selected for the bet, multiplied by the number of unit points above or below the gambler’s bet level. This reflects the fundamental difference between sports spread betting and fixed odds [[sports betting]] in that both the level of winnings and level of losses are not fixed and can end up being many multiples of the original stake size selected.

For example, in a cricket match a sports spread betting firm may list the spread of a team’s predicted runs at 340 – 350. The gambler can elect to ‘buy’ at 350 if they think the team will score more than 350 runs in total, or sell at 340 if they think the team will score less than 340. If the gambler elects to buy at 350 and the team scores 400 runs in total, the gambler will have won 50 unit points multiplied by their initial stake. But if the team only scores 300 runs then the gambler will have lost 50 unit points multiplied by their initial stake.

It is important to note the difference between spreads in sports wagering in the U.S. and sports spread betting in the UK. In the U.S. betting on the spread is effectively still a fixed risk bet on a line offered by the bookmaker with a known return if the gambler correctly bets with either the underdog or the favourite on the line offered and a known loss if the gambler incorrectly bets on the line. In the UK betting above or below the spread does not have a known final profits or loss, with these figures determined by the number of unit points the level of the final outcome ends up being either above or below the spread, multiplied by the stake chosen by the gambler.

For UK spread betting firms, any final outcome that finishes in the middle of the spread will result in profits from both sides of the book as both buyers and sellers will have ended up making unit point losses. So in the example above, if the cricket team ended up scoring 345 runs both buyers at 350 and sellers at 340 would have ended up with losses of five unit points multiplied by their stake.

==Bets on the total (over/under)==
In addition to the spread bet, a very common "side bet" on an event is the ''total'' (commonly called the ''over/under'' or ''O/U'') bet. This is a bet on the total number of points scored by both teams. Suppose team A is playing team B and the total is set at 44.5 points. If the final score is team A 24, team B 17, the total is 41 and bettors who took the ''under'' will win. If the final score is team A 30, team B 31, the total is 61 and bettors who took the ''over'' will win. The total is popular because it allows gamblers to bet on their overall perception of the game (e.g., a high-scoring offensive show or a defensive battle) without needing to pick the actual winner.

In the UK, these bets are sometimes called spread bets, but rather than a simple win/loss, the bet pays more or less depending on how far from the spread the final result is.

Example: In a football match the bookmaker believes that 12 or 13 [[Corner kick|corners]] will occur, thus the spread is set at 12–13.
* A gambler believes that there will be more than 13 corners, and "buys" at £25 a point at 13.
** If the number of corners is 16, the gambler ''wins'' (16–13) = 3 x £25.
** If the number of corners is 10, the gambler ''loses'' (13–10) = 3 x £25.
* A "sell" [[Financial transaction|transaction]] is similar except that it is made against the ''bottom'' value of the spread.
* Often "live pricing" changes the spread during the course of an event, increasing a profit  or minimizing a loss.

In North American sports betting many of these wagers would be classified as ''[[over-under]]'' (or, more commonly today, ''total'') bets rather than spread bets. However, these are for one side or another of a total only, and do not increase the amount won or lost as the actual moves away from the bookmaker's prediction. Instead, over-under or total bets are handled much like ''point-spread'' bets on a team, with the usual 10/11 (4.55%) commission applied. Many Nevada sports books allow these bets in [[parlay (gambling)|parlays]], just like team point spread bets. This makes it possible to bet, for instance, ''team A and the over'', and be paid if ''both'' team A "covers" the point spread and the total score is higher than the book's prediction. (Such parlays usually pay off at odds of 13:5 with no commission charge, just as a standard two-team parlay would.)

==Mathematics of spread betting==
The mathematical [[analysis]] of spreads and spread betting is a large and growing subject. For example, sports that have simple 1-point [[score (game)|scoring]] systems (''e.g.,'' [[baseball]], [[ice hockey|hockey]], and [[soccer]]) may be analysed using [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] and [[Skellam distribution|Skellam]] statistics.

==Financial spread betting==
By far the largest part of the official market in the [[UK]] concerns [[financial]] instruments; the leading spread-betting companies make most of their revenues from financial markets, their sports operations being much less significant.  Financial spread betting in the United Kingdom closely resembles the futures and options markets, the major differences being
* the "charge" occurs through a wider [[bid-offer spread]];
* spread betting has a different tax [[regime]] compared with [[Security (finance)|securities]] and [[futures exchange]]s (see below);
* spread betting is more flexible since it is not limited to exchange hours or definitions, can create new instruments relatively easily (e.g. individual stock futures), and may have guaranteed [[Stop loss order|stop losses]] (see below); and
* the trading is [[Over-the-counter (finance)|off-exchange]], with the contract existing directly between the market-making company and the client, rather than exchange-cleared, and is thus subject to a lower level of [[regulation]].

Financial spread betting is a way to speculate on financial markets in the same way as trading a number of [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]].  In particular, the financial derivative [[Contract for difference]] (CFD) mirrors the spread bet in many ways.  In fact, a number of [[:Category:Financial derivative trading companies|financial derivative trading companies]] offer both financial spread bets and CFDs in parallel using the same trading platform.

Unlike fixed-odds betting, the amount won or lost can be unlimited as there is no single stake to limit any loss. However, it is usually possible to negotiate limits with the bookmaker:
* A ''stop loss'' or ''stop'' automatically closes the bet if the spread moves against the gambler by a specified amount.
* A ''stop win'', ''limit'' or ''take profit'' closes the bet when the spread moves in a gambler's favor by a specified amount.

Spread betting has moved outside the ambit of sport and financial markets (that is, those dealing solely with share, bonds and derivatives), to cover a wide range of markets, such as house prices.&lt;ref&gt;The Sunday Times: [http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/investment/article1310070.ece Spread betting]&lt;/ref&gt; By paying attention to the external factors, such as [[weather]] and time of day, those who are betting using a point spread can be better prepared when it comes to obtaining a favorable outcome. Additionally, by avoiding the [[favourite-longshot bias]], where the expected returns on bets placed at shorter odds exceed that of bets placed at the longer odds, and not betting with one’s favorite team, but rather with the team that has been shown to be better when playing in a specific weather condition and time of day, the possibility of arriving at a positive outcome is increased.

===Tax treatment===
In the UK and some other European countries the profit from spread betting is free from tax.  The UK and some other European countries tax authorities designate financial spread betting as gambling and not investing, meaning it is free from [[capital gains tax]] and [[Stamp duty in the United Kingdom|stamp tax]], despite the fact that its regulated as a financial product by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] in the UK.  Most traders are also not liable for [[income tax]] unless they rely solely on their profits from financial spread betting to support themselves.  The popularity of financial spread betting in the UK and some other European countries, compared to trading other speculative financial instruments such as [[Contract for difference|CFDs]] and [[Futures contract|futures]] is partly due to this tax advantage.  However, this also means any losses cannot be offset against future earnings for tax calculations.

Conversely, in most other countries financial spread betting income is considered taxable.  For example, the [[Australian Tax Office]] issued a decision in March 2010 saying "Yes, the gains from financial spread betting are assessable income under section 6-5 or section 15-15 of the ITAA 1997".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID/AID201056/00001%22 |title=Income Tax – Assessable income derivation of income – spread betting |publisher=Australian Government ATO |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, any losses on the spread betting contracts are deductible.  This has resulted in a much lower interest in financial spread betting in those countries.

=== Financial spread bet example ===
Suppose [[Lloyds Bank]] is trading on the market at 410p bid, and 411p offer. A spread-betting company is also offering 410-411p. We use cash bets with no definite [[expiry]], or "rolling daily bets" as they are referred to by the spread betting companies.

If I think the [[share (finance)|share]] price is going to go up, I might bet £10 a point (''i.e.,'' £10 per penny the shares moves) at  411p.  We use the offer price since I am "buying" the share (betting on its increase). Note that my total loss (if Lloyds Bank went to 0p) could be up to £4110, so this is as risky as buying 1000 of the shares normally.

If a bet goes overnight, the bettor is charged a financing cost (or receives it, if the bettor is shorting the stock). This might be set at [[LIBOR]] + a certain [[percentage]], usually around 2-3%.

Thus, in the example, if Lloyds Bank are trading at 411p, then for every day I keep the bet open I am charged [taking finance cost to be 7%] ((411p x 10) * 7% / 365 ) = £0.78821 (or 78.8p)

On top of this, the bettor needs an amount as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] in the spread-betting account to cover potential losses. Usually this is either 5 or 10% of the total exposure you are taking on but can go up to 100% on illiquid stocks. In this case £4110 * 0.1 or 0.05 = £411.00 or £205.50

If at the end of the bet Lloyds Bank traded at 400-401p, I need to cover that £4110 – £400*10 (£4000) = £110 difference by putting extra deposit (or collateral) into the account.

The punter usually receives all [[dividend]]s and other [[corporate]] adjustments in the financing charge each night. For example, suppose Lloyds Bank goes ex-dividend with dividend of 23.5p. The bettor receives that amount. The exact amount received varies depending on the rules and policies of the spread betting company, and the taxes that are normally charged in the home tax country of the shares.

===Dangers of financial spread betting===
According to an article in ''The Times'' dated 10 April 2009, approximately 30,000 spread bet accounts were opened in the previous year, and that the largest study of gambling in the UK on behalf of the Gambling Commission found that serious problems developed in almost 15% of spread betters compared to 1% of other gambling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Budworth|first=David|title=Spread-betting fails investors in trouble|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/money/investment/article2205147.ece|publisher=thetimes.co.uk|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report from [[Cass Business School]] found that only 1 in 5 [[gambler]]s ends up a winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pfanner|first=Eric|title=Spread-bets on Cup venture into bizarre - Technology - International Herald Tribune|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/technology/02iht-side03.2098227.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in the report, this corresponds to the same ratio of successful gamblers in regular trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rayman|first=Richard|title=White Paper on Spread Betting|url=http://www.hughchristensen.co.uk/papers/Spread%20Betting%20full%20research.pdf|publisher=Cass Business School|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from spread betting firms themselves actually put this closer to being 1 in 10 traders as being profitable, with a high number of clients suffering from the volatility that is supposed to be one of the benefits of spread betting.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[File:Hemlock Overlook - Red light Green light - 01.jpg|thumb|Red Light, Green Light being played at [[Hemlock Overlook Regional Park]]'s [[Ropes course]].]]

'''Statues''' (also known as '''Red Light, Green Light''' in the United States, and '''Grandmother's Footsteps''' in the United Kingdom) is a popular children's game, often played in different countries. How the game is played varies throughout different regions of the world.

== General rules ==

# A person starts out as the "[[Curator]]" (It, Granny, Pooh, etc.) and stands at the end of a field.  Everyone else playing stands at the far end (distance depends upon playing area selected).  The object of the game is for a "Statue" to tag the Curator, thereby becoming the Curator and resetting the game.
# The Curator turns their back to the field, and the "Statues" attempt to race across and tag the Curator.
# Whenever the Curator turns around, the Statues must freeze in position and hold that for as long as the Curator looks at them.  The Curator can even walk around the Statues, examining them.  However, the Curator needs to be careful &amp;ndash; whenever his back is turned, Statues are free to move.
# If a Statue is caught moving, they are sent back to the starting line to begin again (or thrown out of that round, whichever way is preferred.)  Usually, the honesty of the Curator is not enforced, since being a Statue is more desirable.

== Variations ==

=== Red Light/Green Light ===
Red Light/Green Light (sometimes abbreviated as RLGL) is a variation of statue. The "it" person stands at one end of the playing field, with the rest of the players at the other end. "It" turns their back to the others and calls out "Green Light!" or "1, 2, 3! Red Light! Green Light!" or "Red Light! Green Light! 1, 2, 3!" The players then run as fast as they can towards "it". At any time, "it" can face the players, calling out "Red Light", and the others must freeze in place. If anyone fails to stop, they are out or must return to the starting line. The first player to reach the person who is "it" wins and becomes "it" for the next round.

In the Dutch version, instead of "Green light!" the "it" person sings in a slow voice "Annemaria", followed by a quick and loud "Koekkoek!" ("Cuckoo!") when he/she turns around (like "Red Light!"). "Koekkoek!" is also the Dutch equivalent of a Peek-a-boo game played with babies, where the parents hide their face with their hands, then reveal themselves whilst saying "Peek-a-boo!" (also known in Dutch as "Kiekeboe!").

=== Grandmother's Footsteps ===
In this version the Curator is the "Granny" and does not call out anything before facing the players.

=== Winnie the Pooh ===
Winnie the Pooh is a variation of Statues where the person playing "Pooh" (the Curator) usually leans against a wall and has to shout "1, 2, 3, Winnie the Pooh, stop!" (so it is long enough for the players to reach some distance and because of the rhyme it provides in Bulgarian, where this version comes from) before turning to face the players. Whenever a player tags Pooh they have to run so it doesn't catch them. If they manage to go back to the wall where Pooh was leaning before it catches them, they become Pooh and the game starts over. In this variation the role of Pooh is more desirable.

=== Team building exercise ===
Another variation of the Red Light / Green Light game was altered as a [[team building]] exercise. It follows RLGL rules with exception that if anybody moves after the red light the whole team must return to the starting line. Also, the object of the game is for the players to "steal" an "object" positioned near the "it" person and return with it to the other side of the field. Once the "object" is moved it has to stay hidden from "it" who has several guesses as to who has it at the moment. If guessed successfully then the whole team must return to the starting line.

==In popular culture==

* ''[[Doctor Who]]'' writer [[Russell T Davies]] said that the statue role in Grandmother's Footsteps was a concept for the [[Weeping Angel]], a recurring monster on the 2005-present show.
* In [[The Railway Series]] story ''Percy and the Trousers'', [[Percy the Small Engine|Percy]] tries to play Grandmother's Footsteps with the coaches, but hits a trolley of trousers.
* Folk music trio [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] adapted this game into a song called ''Rocky Road'' on their 1963 album, [[In the Wind]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5213">{{Nihongo|'''Tenjō Sajiki''', also '''Tenjou Sajiki'''|天井桟敷|Tenjō Sajiki}}, was a Japanese independent [[theater]] troupe led by [[Shūji Terayama]] and active between 1967 and 1983 (until Terayama's death). A major phenomenon on the [[Japan]]ese [[underground art|underground]] scene, the group has produced a number of stage works marked by experimentalism, [[Japanese folklore|folklore]] influences, social provocation, [[grotesque]] [[erotic art|eroticism]] and the flamboyant fantasy characteristic of Terayama's oeuvre. Tenjō Sajiki benefitted greatly from collaborations with a number of prominent artists, including musicians [[J. A. Seazer]] and [[Kan Mikami]], and graphic designers [[Aquirax Uno]] and [[Tadanori Yokoo]].

==Plot==
On John Conroy's property, the 2-year-old colts and fillies are mustered and brought to the homestead for [[horse breaking]]. Two of the colts are of very good stock, especially the beautiful and spirited colt from the famous racehorse Regret (John Conroy says that the colt is worth a thousand pounds (£1000) and that he wants the colt to eventually be the [[Stud (animal)|stud]] horse for the property).

Jim Ryan arrives at John Conroy's property following the death of his father. When he and Conroy's daughter, Kate, see each other, it is love at first sight for them both.

Jim, however, finds resentment at his presence at the [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]], both from John Conroy, the owner of the property, and the station's [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] and [[Station (Australian agriculture)#Personnel|station hands]], with Dan Mulligan (the leading hand), disdainfully commenting "''We don't want any [[Swagman|swagmen]] here''". Saltbush and McGinness McGee also make [[Wiktionary:disparaging|disparaging]] remarks about Jim Ryan's horse, with Saltbush sarcastically asking Jim if he bought his horse from a [[Mark Foy's]] catalogue, and McGinness McGee commenting that it was more likely that the horse had been saved from a [[Animal glue|glue factory]].

John Conroy also comments that they have enough men working on the property already. Kate pleads with her father to give Jim a job at the property, and he finally relents, saying that Jim can help break the horses. John Conroy resents it when Jim Ryan says that he knows of a better way to break horses than the horse-breaking method being used at the property. However, John Conroy says that Jim could prove his expertise in horse-breaking by breaking the colt from Regret.

During the night, the [[Brumby]] herd gallops close to the homestead, and the colt from Regret breaks free from his tethers and joins them. John Conroy is furious at the loss of his prized colt, and unfairly blames Jim for what has occurred. Conroy decides to get all the crack riders (expert horse riders) from the stations near and far to muster at the homestead and hunt for the Brumbies, offering a reward of £1000, and angrily orders Jim to leave the property first thing in the morning.

The crack riders gather at the homestead the following morning, including Harrison, who made his fortune when Pardon won the cup (a reference to the President's Cup, a lesser known race held in Manindie, New South Wales). Another crack rider at the homestead was [[Clancy of the Overflow]] (who was a friend of Jim). Jim shyly turns up to join in the ride to hunt for the colt and Brumbies, but finds that, apart from his friend, Clancy, he is not wanted by anyone on the ride. Clancy convinces the others that, as both Jim and his horse were mountain-reared, they would be of great help in the ride.

The Brumbies are too quick for the riders and, when it becomes too steep and dangerous with [[wombat]] holes (burrows, where a horse could break a leg), all riders stop short of the dangerous descent &amp;mdash; apart from Jim, who continues to chase the Brumby herd - finally bringing the herd (including the colt) back to John Conroy's property.

John Conroy is delighted to have his colt back again, and gives his approval to Jim marrying Kate. A concert and country dance, as well as a superb [[equestrianism|equestrian]] pageant, are then held in celebration and recognition of Jim's deed, and all ends happily.

===Screen images===
* The screen images, photographed by Ross Dunstan, were provided by [[Australian Geographic|Australian Geographic Pty Ltd]] and are featured in their book ''The Snowy Mountains''.

===Poetry===
* [[Steve Bisley]], in his role of [[Banjo Paterson|Banjo]], recites [[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|the poem]] during Act II in the scene "The Ride &amp;mdash; parts 1&amp;ndash;4", as well as reciting other poems by Banjo Paterson. [[Bud Tingwell]], in his role of "John Conroy", also recited poems by Banjo Paterson.

===Horses, riders and drivers===
* ''The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular'' had real horses performing in the show.
* During the opening sequence of ''The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular'', [[Steve Jefferys]] and his stock horse Ammo reprised their entrance at the beginning of the [[2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony]]. Steve Jeffreys' wife Sandra Langsford also took part in both the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony (in which she was one of the 140 riders) and also took part in ''The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular'', in which she was one of the featured crack riders (expert riders). Steve Jefferys and Sandra Langsford also trained Ammo (the rearing horse), and Drummond (the colt from old Regret), as well as training Jana, the Border Collie (Banjo Paterson's dog).
* For his horse riding role as Jim Ryan in the production of ''The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular'', [[Martin Crewes]], who could already ride, was given intensive riding lessons by expert riding teacher [[Steve Jefferys]], so that Crewes would not require a [[body double]] for the difficult riding feats he had to accomplish in the show. Jefferys also taught Crewes the difficult art of being a [[horse whisperer]] for his role as Jim Ryan. Horse whispering usually takes years to learn, but Crewes was able to master this difficult skill in only two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;''Outside the Arena &amp;ndash; Behind the Scenes'' &amp;mdash; extras section of the DVD release of the show&lt;/ref&gt;
* There was also superb riding, including intricate [[equestrianism|equestrian]] drill movements, and all of the animal actors ('Jana' the Border Collie, and the horses in the show) were magnificent.

* A [[Cobb and Co]] stagecoach, pulled by five horses, was featured in the musical.
* Also featured were a couple of buckboards, with one of the buckboards being pulled by a mare, while the second buckboard was pulled by a gelding (the buckboard horses, which were very similar in colouring, though different in size, were mother and son).

'''Theatre de l'Ange Fou''' is a theatre company based in [[London]], [[England]]. Its artistic directors are [[Steven Wasson]] and [[Corinne Soum]]. It was created in Paris in 1984 and relocated to London in 1995.

==History==
The Theatre de l'Ange Fou and the International School of Corporeal Mime (formerly known as the ''Ecole de Mime Corporel Dramatique'') were created in Paris in 1984 by [[Steven Wasson]] and [[Corinne Soum]], the last assistants of [[Etienne Decroux]], "the father of Modern Mime", and relocated to London in 1995. The International School of Corporeal Mime is devoted to the development of the technique, growing repertoire and dramaturgy of [[Corporeal Mime]], and offers a full range of professional training programmes.

The company has toured throughout Europe, Russia, the United States, Canada, Brazil, Mexico and the Middle East. It has created more than 20 original plays, devised pieces as well as adaptations, ranging from duets to large ensemble works: ''The Little Dictator'' (parts I &amp; II), ''Beyond the Garden'', ''Crusade'', ''Entangled Lives'', ''The Government Inspector'' and ''The Orpheus Complex''.

Using Corporeal Mime as the base of their creative work, the dramaturgical construction of their plays takes the form of a voyage where the characters traverse varied landscapes and lifetimes, some real, some imaginary. The world of the Theatre de l'Ange Fou, this visionary world of contrasting light and darkness, of metamorphosis, is populated by a family of invented archetypes in unknown yet familiar settings. Throughout their various productions, the company explores the infinite possibilities of the interaction between the corporeal score and the spoken text, music and film.

Alongside this personal artistic development, in 1992 Wasson and Soum  took up the challenge of re-introducing the repertoire of Etienne Decroux to the public with their reconstruction, and performances by the Theatre de l'Ange Fou, of most of his major pieces (including ''La Meditation'', ''Les Arbres'' and ''L'Usine'') in ''The Man Who Preferred to Stand'', and more recently, ''Passage of Man on Earth'' and ''Resonance''. This was the beginning of the transmission process that is today the basis of the teaching in the International School of Corporeal Mime.

== History ==

=== Origins and first decade (1986–1996) ===
The Guillemot family had established themselves as a farming support business for farmers in the [[Brittany]] province in northwest France and nearby regions, including into the [[United Kingdom]]. The five sons of the family – Christian, Claude, Gérard, Michel and Yves – helped with the sales, distribution, accounting and management of the company with their parents prior to university. All five gained experience in entrepreneurial while at university, which they brought back to the family business to help improve it, at a time where farming businesses were starting to wane. The brothers came up with the idea of diversification to sell other products of use to farmers; Claude began with selling [[CD audio]] media, and later the brothers expanded to computers and additional software which included video games.&lt;ref name="gi oral"/&gt;

In the early 1980s, they saw that the costs of buying computers and software from a French supplier was more expensive than buying the same materials in the United Kingdom and shipping to France, and came upon the idea of a mail-order business around computers and software. Their mother said they could start their own business this way as long as they managed it themselves and equally split its shares between the five of them. Their first business was Guillemot Informatique, founded in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.company-histories.com/Guillemot-Corporation-Company-History.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamekult"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamekult.com/societe/freres-guillemot-224.html | title = Frères Guillemot | publisher = Gamekult | accessdate = 8 October 2018 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; They originally only sold through mail order, but soon were getting orders from French retailers, since they were able to undercut other suppliers by up to 50% of the cost of new titles. By 1986, this company was earning about 40 million [[French franc]]s.&lt;ref name="gamekult"/&gt; In 1985, the brothers established Guillemot Corporation for similar distribution of computer hardware.&lt;ref name="gamekult"/&gt; As demand continued, the brothers recognized that video game software was becoming a lucrative property, and decided that they needed to get into the development side of the industry, already having insight on the publication and distribution side.&lt;ref name="gi oral"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/12/06/ubi-uncensored.aspx | title = Ubi Uncensored: The History Of Ubisoft By The People Who Wrote It | first = Matt | last =Bertz | date = 6 December 2011 | accessdate = 8 October 2018 | work = [[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 1986, the brothers founded Ubi Soft (formally, Ubi Soft Entertainment S.A.) in [[Carentoir]], a village located in the [[Morbihan]] department in Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n8/games_games.html |title=The European Report: Games, Games And More Games |last=Willey |first=Andre |volume=3 |issue=8 |date=March 1989 |magazine=[[STart]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Ubi Soft" was selected to represent "ubiquitous" software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://twitter.com/UbisoftMTL/status/303541957727248384 | title = Here is the answer to Friday’s questions | author = [[Ubisoft Montreal]] | publisher = [[Twitter]] | date = 18 February 2013 | accessdate = 8 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While they established operating offices in Paris, the brothers used the chateau in Carentoir as the primary space for development, hoping the setting would lure developers, as well as to have a better way to manage expectations of their developers.&lt;ref name="gi oral"/&gt; However, after about two years, the costs of maintaining the chateau were too expensive, and the developers, about a half-dozen at the time, were given the option to relocate to Paris. One of Ubi Soft's first hires was [[Michel Ancel]] who was only a teenager at the time, but had been noticed by the brothers for his animation skills, and he and his family relocated to Carentoir. However, with the chateau's closure, Ancel's family could not afford the cost of living in Paris, and returned to [[Montpellier]] in southern France, while the Guillemot brothers told Ancel to keep them abreast of anything he might come up with there.&lt;ref name="gi oral"/&gt; Ancel came back later with Frédéric Houde with a prototype of a game with highly-animated features which caught the brothers' interest. Michel Guillemot decided to make the project a key one for the company, establishing a studio in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]] to house over 100 developers in 1994, and targeting the new line of [[fifth generation of video game consoles|fifth generation consoles]] like the [[Atari Jaguar]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. Their game, ''[[Rayman (video game)|Rayman]]'', was released in 1995 to critical success, and is considered the game that put Ubi Soft in the worldwide spotlight.&lt;ref name="gi oral"/&gt; Alongside this, Yves managed Guillemot Informatique, making deals with [[Electronic Arts]], [[Sierra On-Line]] and [[MicroProse]] to distribute their games in France. By the end of the decade, Guillemot Informatique began expanding to other markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. They entered the video game distribution and wholesale markets, and by 1993 they had become the largest distributor of video games in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_Issue_054_January_1994/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_Issue_054_January_1994_djvu.txt |title=Behind the Screens at Ubi Soft of France! |last=Quemard |first=Christine |issue=54 |date=January 1994 |page=174 |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |publisher=[[EGM Media]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worldwide growth (1996–2003) ===
In 1996, Ubi Soft listed its [[initial public offering]] and raised over {{USD|80 million}} in funds to help them to expand the company.&lt;ref name="gi oral"/&gt; Within two years, the company established worldwide studios in [[Annecy]] (1996), [[Shanghai]] (1996), [[Montreal]] (1997), and [[Milan]] (1998).

One difficulty that the brothers found was the lack of an intellectual property that would have a foothold in the United States market; games like ''Rayman'' did well in Europe but not overseas.&lt;ref name="gi oral"/&gt; When widespread growth of the Internet arrived around 1999, the brothers decided to take advantage of this by founding game studios aimed at online [[free-to-play]] titles, including [[GameLoft]]; this allowed them to license the rights to Ubi Soft properties to these companies, increasing the share value of Ubi Soft five-fold. With the extra infusion of {{€|170 million}}, they were able to then purchase [[Red Storm Entertainment]] in 2000, giving them access to the ''[[Tom Clancy's]]'' series of stealth and spy games, highly popular in the United States.&lt;ref name="gi oral"/&gt; Ubi Soft helped with Red Storm to continue to expand the series, bringing titles like ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]'' series.&lt;ref name="gi oral"/&gt; The company got a strong foothold in the United States when it worked with [[Microsoft]] to develop ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'', an [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]-exclusive title released in 2002 to challenge the PlayStation-exclusive ''Metal Gear Solid'' series, by combining elements of ''Tom Clancy's'' series with elements of an in-house developed game called ''The Drift''. ''Splinter Cell'' helped not only to sell the Xbox 360 console, but established both Ubi Soft and [[Ubisoft Montreal|its Montreal studio]] as important players in the video game market.&lt;ref name="gi oral"/&gt;

In March 2001, Gores Technology Group sold [[The Learning Company]]'s entertainment division (which includes games originally published by [[Brøderbund]], [[Mattel Interactive]], [[Mindscape]] and [[Strategic Simulations]]) to them. The sale included the rights to [[Intellectual property|intellectual properties]] such as the ''[[Myst]]'' and ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamezone.com/news/ubi_soft_acquires_the_learning_company_s_entertainment_division |title=Ubi Soft Acquires The Learning Company's Entertainment Division |last=Vogel |first=Cassie |date=1 March 2007 |website=GameZone |publisher=GameZone Next |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft Montreal developed the ''Prince of Persia'' title into ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', released in 2003, another critically successful title.&lt;ref name="gi oral"/&gt; At the same time, Ubi Soft also released ''[[Beyond Good &amp; Evil]]'', Ancel's project after ''Rayman''; it was one of Ubi Soft's first commercial "flop", as while it has gained an appreciation over time, it was met with lukewarm reception at its release alongside a competitive 2003 release market.&lt;ref name="gi oral"/&gt;

=== Continued expansion (2003–2015) ===
On 9 September 2003, Ubi Soft announced that they would change their name to simply Ubisoft, and introduced a new logo known as "the swirl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news090903ubisoftlogo |title=Ubisoft unveils new logo |first= Tom | last =Bramwell |date= 9 September 2003 |website=eurogamer.net |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/ubisoft-unveils-new-visual-identity |title=Ubisoft unveils new "visual identity" |first = Rob | last = Fahey |date = 9 September 2003 |website=gamesindustry.biz |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, rival gaming corporation [[Electronic Arts]] purchased a 19.9% stake in the firm. Ubisoft referred to the purchase as "hostile" on EA's part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/electronic-arts-buys-stake-in-ubisoft-in-hostile-act/1100-6115370/ |title=Electronic Arts buys stake in Ubisoft in "hostile" act |last=Feldman |first=Curt |date=20 December 2004 |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft's brothers recognized they had not considered themselves within a competitive market, and employees had feared that an EA takeover would drastically alter the environment within Ubisoft. EA's CEO at the time, [[John Riccitiello]], assured Ubisoft the purchase was not meant as a hostile maneuver, and EA ended up selling the shares in 2010.&lt;ref name="gi oral"/&gt;

Ubisoft established another new IP, ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'', first launched in 2007; ''Assassin's Creed'' was originally developed by Ubisoft Montreal as a sequel to ''Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time'' but instead transitioned to a story about [[Assassins]] and the [[Templar Knights]].&lt;ref name="gi oral"/&gt; In July 2006, Ubisoft bought the ''[[Driver (series)|Driver]]'' franchise from [[Atari]] for a sum of €19&amp;nbsp;million in cash for the franchise, technology rights, and most assets. In July 2008, Ubisoft made the acquisition of [[Hybride Technologies]], a [[Piedmont, Quebec|Piedmont]]-based studio renowned for its expertise in the creation of visual effects for cinema, television and advertising. In November 2008, Ubisoft acquired [[Massive Entertainment]] from [[Activision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.develop-online.net/press-releases/ubisoft-reg-acquires-the-assets-of-massive-entertainment-reg/0128916 |title=Ubisoft® acquires the Assets of Massive Entertainment® |last=Lawton |first=Adrian |date=10 November 2008 |website=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]] |publisher=[[NewBay Media]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, Ubisoft acquired ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' from [[THQ]] for $3.265&amp;nbsp;million.

Ubisoft announced plans in 2013 to invest $373&amp;nbsp;million into its Quebec operations over seven years, a move that is expected to generate 500 additional jobs in the province. The publisher is investing in the expansion of its motion capture technologies, and consolidating its online games operations and infrastructure in Montreal. By 2020, the company will employ more than 3,500 staff at its studios in Montreal and Quebec City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.develop-online.net/news/ubisoft-investing-370m-in-quebec-operations/0115959 |title=Ubisoft investing $370m in Quebec operations |last=Chapple |first=Craig |date=30 September 2013 |website=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]] |publisher=[[NewBay Media]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, the company set up a Consumer Relationship Centre in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]]. The centre is intended to integrate consumer support teams and community managers. Consumer Support and Community Management teams at the CRC are operational seven days a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/news-story/ubisoft-invests-new-consumer-relationship-centre-newcastle |title=Ubisoft invests in new Consumer Relationship Centre in Newcastle |date=13 March 2015 |website=[[Newcastle City Council]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempted takeover by Vivendi and present (2015–onward) ===
Since around 2015, the French [[mass media]] company [[Vivendi]] has been seeking to expand its media properties through acquisitions and other business deals. In addition to advertising firm [[Havas]], Ubisoft was one of the first target properties identified by Vivendi, which as of September 2017 has an estimated valuation of $6.4&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="reuters april2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vivendi-agm-strategy-idUSKBN17R0IO |title=Exclusive: Vivendi to accelerate expansion in video games and advertising – sources |first1=Mathieu |last1=Rosemain |first2=Gwénaëlle |last2=Barzic |date=25 April 2017 |accessdate=27 June 2017 |work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/22/ubisoft-shareholders-support-guillemot-family-but-vivendi-threat-lingers/ |title=Ubisoft shareholders support Guillemot family, but Vivendi threat lingers |first=Dean |last=Takahashi |date=22 September 2017 |accessdate=22 September 2017 |work=[[Venture Beat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivendi, in two separate actions during October 2015, bought shares in Ubisoft stock, giving them a 10.4% stake in Ubisoft, an action that Yves Guillemot considered "unwelcome" and feared a [[hostile takeover]].&lt;ref name="vg247 oct2015"/&gt; In a presentation during the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016]], Yves Guillemot stressed the importance that Ubisoft remain an independent company to maintain its creative freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/274883/Ubisoft_CEO_stresses_creative_independence_as_Vivendi_takeover_threat_looms.php |title=Ubisoft CEO stresses creative independence as Vivendi takeover threat looms |first=Kris |last=Graft |date=13 June 2017 |accessdate=27 June 2017 |work=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice-President of Live Operations, Anne Blondel-Jouin, expressed similar sentiment in an interview with ''[[PCGamesN]]'', stating that Ubisoft's success was (partly) due to "...being super independent, being very autonomous."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/11/24/13743236/ubisoft-vivendi-takeover |title=Ubisoft exec says Vivendi takeover could damage culture of innovation |last=Campbell |first=Colin |date=24 November 2016 |website=Polygon|access-date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/ubisoft-vivendi-takeover-bid |title="It's not going to be the same if Vivendi take over" says Ubisoft VP of live ops |work=PCGamesN|access-date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivendi also acquired stake in mobile game publisher [[Gameloft]], also owned by the Guillemots, at the same time it started acquiring Ubisoft shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-activision-owner-vivendi-buys-stakes-in-ubi/1100-6431427/ |title=Former Activision Owner Vivendi Buys Stakes in Ubisoft and Gameloft |last=Hussain |first=Tamoor |date=15 October 2015 |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vg247 oct2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/10/23/vivendi-buys-even-more-ubisoft-shares/ |title=Vivendi buys even more Ubisoft shares |first=Sharif |last=Saed |date=23 October 2015 |accessdate=27 June 2017 |work=[[VG247]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following February, Vivendi acquired €500&amp;nbsp;million worth of shares in Gameloft, gaining more than 30% of the shares and requiring the company under French law to make a public [[tender offer]]; this action enabled Vivendi to complete the hostile takeover of Gameloft by June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.gameloft.ca/download-games/news/3934-gameloft%EF%BF%BDsreaction/?actual_page=1&amp;request=news&amp;date= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419013436/https://en.gameloft.ca/download-games/news/3934-gameloft%EF%BF%BDsreaction/?actual_page=1&amp;request=news&amp;date= | dead-url=yes | archive-date=19 April 2016 |title=Gameloft's Reaction |last=d'Hauteville |first=Laure |date=18 February 2016 |website=[[Gameloft]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ft feb2016"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/5bfee510-d64c-11e5-829b-8564e7528e54 |title=Ubisoft sets out growth plan to fend off Vivendi |first=Robert |last=Cookson |date=16 February 2016 |accessdate=27 June 2017 |work=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/274002/Vivendi_succeeds_in_hostile_Gameloft_takeover.php |title=Vivendi succeeds in hostile Gameloft takeover |first=Chris |last=Kerr |date=1 June 2016 |accessdate=27 June 2017 |work=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Vivendi's actions with Gameloft in February 2016, the Guillemots asked for more Canadian investors in the following February to fend off a similar Vivendi takeover;&lt;ref name="The Globe and Mail"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/ubisoft-turns-to-canadian-investors-to-fend-off-takeover-bid/article28920702/ |title=Maker of Assassin's Creed video game turns to Canadian investors to fend off takeover bid |last=Van Praet |first=Nicolas |date=25 February 2016 |website=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-asks-canada-to-help-head-off-hostile-takeover-by-vivendi/ |title=Ubisoft asks Canada to help head off hostile takeover by Vivendi |last=Chalk |first=Andy |date=26 February 2016 |website=[[PC Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future US]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/why-ubisoft-is-afraid-of-a-hostile-takeover-1761561366 |title=Ubisoft Is Afraid Of A Hostile Takeover |last=Schreier |first=Jason |date=26 February 2016 |website=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by this point, Vivendi had increased their share in Ubisoft to 15%, exceeding the estimated 9% that the Guillemots owned.&lt;ref name="ft feb2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Globe and Mail" /&gt; By mid-June 2016, Vivendi had increased its shares to 20.1%, but denied it was in the process of a takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/275432/Vivendi_ups_stake_in_Ubisoft_to_201_percent_edges_toward_takeover.php |title=Vivendi ups stake in Ubisoft to 20.1 percent, edges toward takeover |first=Chris |last=Kerr |date=21 June 2016 |accessdate=27 June 2017 |work=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of Ubisoft's annual board meeting in September 2016, Vivendi has gained 23% of the shares, while Guillemots were able to increase their voting share to 20%. A request was made at the board meeting to place Vivendi representatives on Ubisoft's board, given the size of their share holdings. The Guillemots argued strongly against this, reiterating that Vivendi should be seen as a competitor, and succeeded in swaying other voting members to deny any board seats to Vivendi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/ubisoft-founders-win-respite-as-vivendi-holds-back-on-board-bid |title=Ubisoft Founders Victorious as Vivendi Board Bid Is Averted |first=Alexandre |last=Boksenbaum-Granier |date=29 September 2016 |accessdate=27 June 2017 |work=[[Bloomberg News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivendi continued to buy shares in Ubisoft, approaching the 30% mark that could trigger a hostile takeover; as of December 2016, Vivendi held a 27.15% stake in Ubisoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vivendi.com/en/press/press-releases/vivendi-exceeded-the-25-shareholding-threshold-in-ubisoft/ |title=Vivendi exceeded the 25% shareholding threshold in Ubisoft |date=7 December 2016 |website=[[Vivendi]] |accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Reuters]]'' reported in April 2017 that Vivendi's takeover of Ubisoft would likely happen that year,&lt;ref name="reuters april2017"/&gt; and ''Bloomberg Businessweek'' observed that some of Vivendi's shares would reach the two-year holding mark, which would grant them double voting power, and would likely meet or exceed the 30% threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-22/ubisoft-ceo-bets-on-cloud-ai-to-stay-ahead-of-vivendi-threat |title=Ubisoft Bets on Cloud, AI to Stay Ahead of Vivendi Threat |first=y Alexandre |last=Boksenbaum-Granier |date=22 September 2017 |accessdate=26 September 2017 |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guillemot family has since raised their stake in Ubisoft; as of June 2017, the family now held 13.6 percent of Ubisoft's share capital, and 20.02 percent of the company's voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ubisoft-vivendi-idUSKBN19I0WC |title=Ubisoft founding family raises stake to ward off Vivendi |first=Sudip |last=Kar-Gupta |work=[[Reuters]] |date=27 June 2017 |accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, Ubisoft announced it reached a deal with an "investment services provider" to help them purchase back 4 million shares by the end of the year, preventing others, specifically Vivendi, from buying these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-continues-to-fight-off-vivendi-takeover/1100-6453792/ |title=Ubisoft Continues To Fight Off Vivendi Takeover |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=4 October 2017 |accessdate=4 October 2017 |work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the week just before Vivendi would gain double-voting rights for previously purchased shares, which would have likely pushed their ownership over 30%, the company, in quarterly results published in November 2017, that it has no plans to acquire Ubisoft for the next six months, nor will seek board positions due to the shares they hold during that time, and that it "will ensure that its interest in Ubisoft will not exceed the threshold of 30% through the doubling of its voting rights." Vivendi remained committed to expanding in the video game sector, identifying that their investment in Ubisoft could represent a capital gain of over 1 billion euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-11-16-vivendi-no-plans-for-ubisoft-takeover-for-six-months |title=Vivendi: No plans for Ubisoft takeover for six months |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |date=16 November 2017 |accessdate=16 November 2017 |work=[[GamesIndustry.biz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 March 2018, Ubisoft and Vivendi struck a deal ending any potential takeover, with Vivendi agreeing to sell all of its shares, over 30 million, to other parties and agreeing to not buy any Ubisoft shares for five years. Some of those shares were sold to [[Tencent]], which after the transaction held about 5.6 million shares of Ubisoft; the same day, Ubisoft announced a partnership with Tencent to help bring their games into the Chinese market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/vivendi-sells-all-of-its-ubisoft-shares-to-tencent-and-others-w518120 |title=Vivendi Sells All of its Ubisoft Shares to Tencent and Others |first=Brian |last=Crecente |date=20 March 2018 |accessdate=20 March 2018 |work=[[Glixel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivendi affirmed it would completely divest its shares in Ubisoft by March 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/327507/Vivendi_lays_plan_to_relinquish_the_last_of_its_Ubisoft_stock_by_2019.php | title= Vivendi lays plan to relinquish the last of its Ubisoft stock by 2019 | first= Alex | last =Wawro | date = 27 September 2018 | accessdate = 27 September 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Games ==
{{Main|List of Ubisoft games}}

=== Games as a service ===
Ubisoft noticed that connected sandbox experiences, with seamless switches between single and multiplayer modes provided the players with more fun, leading the company to switch from pursuing single-player only games to internet connected online experiences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/3/8/11179934/ubisoft-division-interview-future-watch-dogs-2 |title=The Division isn't just Ubisoft's next game, it's the company's future |last=Crecente |first=Brian |date=8 March 2016 |website=Polygon |language=en|access-date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Guillemot, Ubisoft internally refers to its reimagined self as 'before ''The Division''{{'}} and an 'after ''The Division''{{'}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Verge]]'', Anne Blondel-Jouin, executive producer of [[The Crew (video game)|''The Crew'']] turned vice-president of live operations,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.ubisoft.com/article/ubisoft-highlights-strategies-2017-corporate-event-gdc |title=Ubisoft Highlights Strategies 2017 Corporate Event GDC |last= |first= |date=1 March 2017 |website=Ubisoft|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that ''The Crew'' was an early game of Ubisoft's to require a persistent internet connection in order to play.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This raised initial concerns for gamers, hampering the game's initial success and sparked concerns internally at the company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Technology ==

=== Uplay ===
{{Main|Uplay}}
Uplay is a [[digital distribution]], [[digital rights management]], multiplayer and communications service for PC created by Ubisoft. Ubisoft Club is a reward program connected ot Uplay Members earn rewards by completing certain actions while playing games published by Ubisoft. Completing an action gives you a certain number of Units, which members can use to unlock those rewards or to get a discount on games from the Uplay Store.

=== AnvilNext ===
{{Main|AnvilNext}}
AnvilNext, formerly named Scimitar, is a proprietary [[game engine]] developed wholly within [[Ubisoft Montreal]] in 2007 for the development of the first ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'' game, and since expanded and used for nearly all other ''Assassin's Creed'' titles and other Ubisoft games.

=== Dunia engine ===
The Dunia engine is a [[Fork (software development)|software fork]] of the [[CryEngine]] that was originally developed by [[Crytek]], with modifications made by Ubisoft Montreal. The CryEngine was unique at the time as it could render large outdoor environmental spaces. Crytek had created a demo of their engine called ''X-Isle: Dinosaur Island'' which they had demonstrated at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 1999]]. Ubisoft saw the demo, and had Crytek build out the demo into a full title, becoming the first ''[[Far Cry (video game)|Far Cry]]'', released in 2004.&lt;ref name="x-isle"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2013/7/11/4503782/crytek-x-isle-redemption | title = THE STORY OF CRYTEK: FROM X-ISLE THROUGH REDEMPTION | first= Charlie | last = Hall | date = July 11, 2013 | accessdate = May 31, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Electronic Arts]] established a deal with Crytek to build a wholly different title with an improved version of the CryEngine, leaving them unable to continue work on ''Far Cry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=4066 | title = EA Sign Crytek | first = David | last = Jenkins | date = July 23, 2004 | accessdate = May 30, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft assigned Ubisoft Montreal to develop console versions of ''Far Cry'', and arranging with Crytek to have all rights to the ''Far Cry'' series as well as a perpetual license on the CryEngine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/30/ubisoft-acquires-rights-to-far-cry | title = UBISOFT ACQUIRES RIGHTS TO FAR CRY | first = Wade | last = Steel | date = March 30, 2006 | accessdate = May 30, 2017 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing ''[[Far Cry 2]]'', Ubisoft Montreal modified the CryEngine to include destructable environments and a more realistic [[physics engine]]. This modified version became the Dunia Engine, which premiered with ''Far Cry 2'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/110295/InDepth_Far_Cry_2s_Guay_Talks_Dunia_Engine_State_Of_PC.php | title = In-Depth: Far Cry 2's Guay Talks Dunia Engine, State Of PC | first = Christian | last = Nutt | date = July 9, 2008 | accessdate = May 30, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fc2 making"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/255364/The_making_of_Far_Cry_2.php |title = The making of Far Cry 2 | first = Chris | last = Hocking | date = September 15, 2017 | accessdate = May 30, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dunia engine continued to be improved, such as adding weather systems, and used of the basis of all future ''[[Far Cry]]'' games, as well as ''[[James Cameron's Avatar: The Game]]'', also developed by Ubisoft Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-far-cry-engine-tech-evolution | title = Is Far Cry 2's tech really more advanced than Far Cry 5's? | first = Alex | last =Battaglia | date = April 10, 2018 | accessdate = September 27, 2018 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/5965973/far-cry-3-pc-performance-test-graphics--cpu|title=Far Cry 3 PC Performance Test: Graphics &amp; CPU|publisher=Kotaku.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Remi Quenin, one of the engine's architect at Ubisoft Montreal, the state of the Dunia Engine as of 2017 includes "vegetation, fire simulation, destruction, vehicles, systemic AI, wildlife, weather, day/night cycles, [and] non linear storytelling" which are all fundamental elements of the ''Far Cry'' games, and little of the original CryEngine code remained in the current version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/311123/GDC_Speaker_QA_Building_the_data_pipeline_for_Ubisofts_Far_Cry_5.php | title = GDC Speaker Q&amp;A: Building the data pipeline for Ubisoft's Far Cry 5 | first = Emma | last= Kidwell | date = December 6, 2017 | accessdate = September 27, 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== 2000s ===
Ubisoft used the controversial "StarForce" [[copy protection]] technology which is able to install drivers on a system and is known to cause hardware and compatibility issues with certain operating systems. In April 2006, Ubisoft confirmed that they would stop using StarForce on their games, citing complaints from customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-officially-dumps-starforce/1100-6147655/ |title=Ubisoft officially dumps Starforce |last=Thorsen |first=Tor |date=13 April 2006 |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the February 2008 issue of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', editor-in-chief Dan "EGMShoe" Hsu asserted that Ubisoft had ceased to provide Ubisoft titles to ''EGM'' for coverage purposes as a result of prior critical previews and negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2008/01/3_companies_bar_egm_from_cover/ |title=3 Companies Bar EGM From Coverage Following Poor Reviews |last=Plunkett |first=Luke |date=9 January 2008 |website=[[Kotaku Australia]] |publisher=[[Allure Media]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=8568051 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20150816082424/http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=8568051 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=16 August 2015 |title=Banned |last=Hsu |first=Dan |date=9 January 2008 |website=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yves Guillemot, the CEO of Ubisoft, was quoted in the company's third-quarter 2008–09 sales report as saying "''as some of our games did not meet the required quality levels to achieve their full potential, they need more sales promotions than anticipated''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ubisoftgroup.com/comsite_common/en-US/images/2008-2009_3rd%20Quarter%20Sales_PR_tcm99-27682_tcm99-196733-32.pdf |title=Ubisoft® reports third-quarter 2008–09 sales |last=Roquette |first=Jean-Benoît |date=22 January 2009 |website=Ubisoft |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, Ubisoft was criticised by the antiwar group [[Direct Action to Stop the War]] (DASW) for its role as a developer of propaganda and recruitment tools for the [[United States Department of Defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/antiwar-group-targets-ubisoft-americas-army/1100-6195531/ |title=Antiwar group targets Ubisoft, America's Army |last=Sinclair |first=Brendan |date=6 August 2008 |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===
In January 2010, Ubisoft announced the online services platform [[Uplay]], which requires customers to authenticate on the first game launch and to [[Always-on DRM|remain online continually]] while playing, with the game pausing if network connection is lost. This system prevent to play games offline, to resell them and in the case should Ubisoft's servers go down, games would be unplayable. In 2010, review versions of ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'' and ''[[Settlers 7]]'' for the PC contained this new DRM scheme and instead of pausing the game, it would discard all progress since the last checkpoint or save game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/02/18/assassins-creed-ii-pc-requires-constant-internet-connection |title=Assassin's Creed II PC Requires Constant Internet Connection |last=Reilly |first=Jim |date=18 February 2010 |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent patches for ''Assassin's Creed II'' allowed players to continue playing once their connection has been restored without loss of progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ubisoft-assassin-s-creed-drm-protection,9807.html |title=Ubisoft Patch Makes its Internet DRM Less Painful |last=Yam |first=Marcus |date=5 March 2010 |website=[[Tom's Hardware]] |publisher=[[Purch Group]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, outages to the Ubisoft DRM servers were reported, causing about 5% of legitimate buyers to be unable to play ''Assassin's Creed II'' and ''[[Silent Hunter 5]]''.&lt;ref name="The Escapist"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/98935-Ubisoft-Blames-DRM-Outage-on-Server-Attack |title=Ubisoft Blames DRM Outage on "Server Attack" |last=Chalk |first=Andy |date=8 March 2010 |website=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |publisher=[[Defy Media]] |accessdate=21 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051626/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/98935-Ubisoft-Blames-DRM-Outage-on-Server-Attack |archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ubisoft-drm-was-attacked-at-weekend |title=Ubisoft DRM was "attacked" at weekend |last=Bramwell |first=Tom |date=8 March 2010 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=[[Gamer Network]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft initially announced this was the result of the number of users attempting to access their servers to play, but later claimed that the real cause of the outages were [[denial-of-service attack]]s.&lt;ref name="The Escapist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt; In August 2011, Ubisoft released ''[[From Dust]]'' with DRM protection, contrary to previous statements that the game would not have any DRM related restrictions. After several months, the DRM had still not been removed from copies of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/08/18/from-dust-pc-players-erupt-in-anger-over-port/ |title=From Dust PC players erupt in anger over port |last=McElroy |first=Justin |date=18 August 2011 |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL Tech]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's use of Aaron Priceman, also known as ''Mr. Caffeine'' by the internet, as a spokesman at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011]] was criticised for his reliance on popular internet references, inability to pronounce Tom Clancy (pronounced by Priceman as "Tom Culancy"), sexual innuendos and imitations of video game sound effects with little to no response from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/are-publishers-doing-e3-badly-on-purpose--203746.phtml |title=Are publishers doing E3 badly on purpose? |last=Sterling |first=Jim |date=14 June 2011 |website=[[Destructoid]] |publisher=[[ModernMethod]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Ubisoft announced a major breach in its network resulting in the potential exposure of up to 58 million accounts including usernames, email address and encrypted passwords. Although the firm denied any credit/debit card information could have been compromised, it issued directives to all registered users to change their account passwords and also recommended updating passwords on any other website or service where a same or similar password had been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-23159997 |title=Ubisoft warns millions of video gamers of hack attack |date=3 July 2013 |website=[[BBC News]] |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the users who registered were emailed by the Ubisoft company about the breach and a password change request. Ubisoft promised to keep the information safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/02/ubisofts-uplay-service-hacked/ |title=Ubisoft Website Hacked |last=Goldfarb |first=Andrew |date=2 July 2013 |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After revealing ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]'' at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014]], Ubisoft came in for criticism from the gaming community shortly after revealing that the game would not support female characters in co-op gameplay. The criticism was inflamed after they explained the absence of a female co-op or playable character in ''[[Far Cry 4]]'': according to Ubisoft Montreal, they were close to making it possible when the decision was taken that they didn't have the right animations for a female character.&lt;ref name="Polygon"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/6/11/5801330/far-cry-4-women-ubisoft |title=Far Cry 4 devs were 'inches away' from women as playable characters |last=Ray Corriea |first=Alexa |date=11 June 2014 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the responses were comments from developers that the explanations given were not valid. Among them were the fact that the protagonists of ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' and its spin-off game ''[[Assassin's Creed III: Liberation|Liberation]]'' shared a large number of movement animations. There were also statements that characters in video games tended to move in a similar fashion regardless of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-in-trouble-over-comments-about-female-character-1589611410 |title=Ubisoft in Trouble Over Comments About Female Characters |last=LeJacq |first=Yannick |date=6 November 2014 |website=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An animation director for ''Assassin's Creed III'' also said that the stated reasons of workload and animation replacement didn't hold up, saying that it would be "a day or two's work" to create a female character model.&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt;

== Lawsuits ==
* In 2008, Ubisoft sued Optical Experts Manufacturing (OEM), a [[DVD]] duplication company for $25&amp;nbsp;million plus damages for the leak and distribution of the PC version of ''Assassin's Creed''. The lawsuit claims that OEM did not take proper measures to protect its product as stated in its contract with Ubisoft. The complaint also alleges that OEM admitted to all the problems in the complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.neoseeker.com/news/8547-ubisoft-suing-over-assassins-creed-leak/ |title=Ubisoft suing over Assassin's Creed leak |last=Sung |first=Lydia |date=7 August 2008 |website=Neoseeker |publisher=Neo Era Media |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2012, Ubisoft was sued by the author of the book ''Link'', John L. Beiswenger, who alleged a [[copyright infringement]] for using his ideas in the ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise and demanding $5.25&amp;nbsp;million in damages and wanted to stop the release of ''Assassin's Creed III'' that was set to be released in October 2012 along with any future games that allegedly contain his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/238112/montreal-based-company-ubisoft-target-of-5-million-copyright-lawsuit/ |title=Montreal-based company Ubisoft target of $5-million copyright lawsuit |last=Magder |first=Jason |date=25 April 2012 |website=[[Global News]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2012, Beiswenger dropped the lawsuit. Beiswenger was later quoted as saying he believes "authors should vigorously defend their rights in their creative works", and suggested that Ubisoft's motion to block future lawsuits from Beiswenger hints at their guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/04/sci-fi-author-sues-ubisoft-over-assassins-creed-copyright-infringement/ |title=Sci-fi author sues Ubisoft over Assassin's Creed copyright infringement |last=Orland |first=Kyle |date=19 April 2012 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In December 2014, Ubisoft offered a free game from their catalogue of recently released titles to compensate the season pass owners of ''Assassin's Creed Unity'' due to its buggy launch. The terms offered with the free game revoked the user's right to sue Ubisoft for the buggy launch of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassin-s-creed-unity-free-game-offer-waives-laws/1100-6424381/ |title=Assassin's Creed Unity Free Game Offer Waives Lawsuits |last=Makuch |first=Eddie |date=23 December 2014 |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Watership Down''''' is a 1978 British [[Animation|animated]] [[Adventure film|adventure]]-[[Drama film|drama]] film written, produced and directed by [[Martin Rosen (director)|Martin Rosen]] and based on the [[Watership Down|novel of the same name]] by [[Richard Adams]]. It was financed by a consortium of British financial institutions. The film was distributed by [[Cinema International Corporation]] in the United Kingdom, while the film was distributed by [[Embassy Pictures|AVCO Embassy Pictures]] theatrically in the US and on home video by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]] via [[Warner Bros. Animation]] in the United States and internationally. Originally released on 19 October 1978, the film was an immediate success and it became the sixth most popular film of 1979 at the British box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.toonhound.com/watershipdown.htm | title=''Watership Down'' | accessdate=2006-12-18 | publisher=Toonhound}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first animated feature film to be presented in [[Dolby Laboratories|Dolby]] surround sound.

It features the voices of [[John Hurt]], [[Richard Briers]], [[Harry Andrews]], [[Simon Cadell]], [[Nigel Hawthorne]] and [[Roy Kinnear]], among others, and was the last film work of [[Zero Mostel]], as the voice of Kehaar the gull. The musical score was by [[Angela Morley]] and [[Malcolm Williamson]]. [[Art Garfunkel]]'s hit song "[[Bright Eyes (Art Garfunkel song)|Bright Eyes]]", which was written by songwriter [[Mike Batt]], briefly features.

==Plot==
According to Adams' [[Lapine language]], culture and mythology, the world was created by the god Frith, who represents the Sun. All animals lived harmoniously, but the rabbits eventually multiplied, and their appetite led to a food shortage. At the prayers of the desperate animals, Frith ordered the prince rabbit, El-ahrairah, to control his people, but was scoffed at. In retaliation, Frith gave special gifts to every animal, but some animals he made predators to prey upon the rabbits. Satisfied that El-ahrairah (now also known as "Prince with a Thousand Enemies") had learned his lesson, Frith also gave the rabbits speed and cunning; while many would seek to kill them, the rabbits could survive by their wits and quickness.

In the present, in the English countryside of Sandleford, Fiver, a rabbit [[Clairvoyance|seer]] has an apocalyptic vision and goes with his older brother Hazel to beg the chief to have the warren evacuated, but they are dismissed and attempt to make an exodus themselves. The group meets resistance from the warren's police force called the Owsla, but eight manage to fight and escape: Fiver, Hazel, Bigwig, Blackberry, Pipkin, Dandelion, Silver, and Violet. They travel through the dangerous woods and make it to a bean field to rest. In the morning, Violet is killed by a hawk, leaving the group without a female.

After several dangerous situations, they meet the enigmatic rabbit Cowslip, who invites them to his warren. They are grateful, but Fiver senses something unsettling in the atmosphere, as well as the resident rabbits' overly resigned attitudes, and leaves. An irked Bigwig follows, and chastises Fiver for supposedly causing senseless tension with his instincts. Moments later, however, he is caught in a [[Animal trapping|snare trap]]. Fiver attempts to get help from their hosts, but is ignored. Bigwig is freed after nearly dying. As Fiver reveals, the warren is fed by a farmer who snares rabbits in return for his food and protection from predators. After Bigwig's narrow escape, the other rabbits willingly follow Fiver's and Hazel's advice and set out once more.

The rabbits discover Nuthanger farm, which contains a [[Hutch (animal cage)|hutch]] of female rabbits, necessary for a new warren. However, they do not manage to free them, on account of the territorial farm cat and dog. Later, they are found by the maimed Owsla Captain Holly, who recounts the destruction of Sandleford by humans, and a mysterious group called the "Efrafrans" before falling unconscious. After he recovers, Fiver finally leads the group to the hill he envisioned, [[Watership Down, Hampshire|Watership Down]], where the rabbits settle in with Hazel as their chief.

They befriend an [[Wiktionary:acerbic#English|acerbic]] injured [[black-headed gull]], Kehaar, who offers to survey the local area for does. The rabbits return to Nuthanger Farm to free the does; Hazel is shot by a farmer and presumed dead, but Fiver has a vision and follows the apparition of the Black Rabbit of Inlé (the rabbit equivalent of the [[Grim Reaper]]) to his injured brother. Kehaar returns and while removing [[buckshot]] pellets from Hazel's leg, reports of Efrafa, a large warren with many females. Holly, who encountered Efrafa, begs them not to go there, describing it as a totalitarian state, run by vicious and heavily territorial rabbits. Hazel feels they have no choice but to go there. Bigwig infiltrates the enemy warren and is made an Owsla officer by the cruel chief, General Woundwort. Bigwig recruits several potential escapees to his cause, including Hyzenthlay, an idealistic doe and Blackavar, a scarred attempted escapee. They flee, and using a boat to float down the river, they evade capture, helped by Kehaar. That night, Kehaar leaves for his homeland with the gratitude of the warren.

Several days later, Efrafan trackers discover their trail and follow them to Watership Down. Hazel offers a treaty with Woundwort, who dismisses Hazel, telling him to turn over Bigwig and all the deserters or he will kill the entire warren. The Watership rabbits barricade their warren and are besieged by the Efrafans. Fiver slips into a [[trance]], in which he envisions a dog loose in the woods. His moans inspire Hazel to free the dog from Nuthanger Farm and lead him to the Efrafans. He escapes with Blackberry, Dandelion and Hyzenthlay.

Hazel prays to Frith, offering his life for the warren; a bargain Frith acknowledges, but does not accept. Hazel releases the dog while his companions bait it into following them to Watership Down; Hazel is attacked by the cat, but saved by Lucy (the owner of the hutch rabbits). When the Efrafans break through the warren's defences, Woundwort goes in alone; Blackavar attacks him, but Woundwort slays him easily. Bigwig [[ambush]]es Woundwort and they fight to exhaustion. The dog arrives and attacks the Efrafan soldiers. Hearing the commotion, Woundwort abandons Bigwig and fearlessly confronts the dog. No trace of Woundwort is found, leaving his fate ambiguous.

Several years later, the warren is thriving. An elderly Hazel is visited by El-ahrairah, who invites him to join his own Owsla, assuring him of Watership Down's perpetual safety and its future. Reassured, Hazel accepts and dies peacefully. His spirit then follows El-ahrairah through the woodland and trees towards the Sun, which metamorphoses into Frith, and the [[afterlife]].

==Production==
Production of the film began in 1975 and was originally to be directed by [[John Hubley]], who died in 1977. His work can still be found in the film, most notably in the "fable" scene. He was replaced by the film's producer Martin Rosen, his directorial debut.

After the genesis story, which was rendered in a narrated simple cartoon fashion, the animation style changes to a detailed, naturalistic one. There are concessions to render the animals [[anthropomorphic]] only to suggest that they have human voices and minds, some facial expressions for emotion, and paw gestures. The animation backgrounds are watercolors. Only one of the predators, the farm cat Tab, is given a few lines, the rest remaining mute.

The backgrounds and locations, especially Efrafa and the nearby railway, are based on the diagrams and maps in Richard Adams's original novel. Most of the locations in the movie either exist or were based on real spots in [[Hampshire]] and surrounding areas.

Although the film is fairly faithful to the novel, several changes were made to the storyline, mainly to decrease overly detailed complexity and improve the pace and flow of the plot. In addition, the order in which some events occur is re-arranged. Unlike many animated features, the film faithfully emulated the dark and violent sophistication of the book. As a result, many reviewers took to warning parents that children might find the content disturbing. When the film was first submitted to the [[British Board of Film Classification]], the BBFC passed the film with a 'U' certificate (suitable for all ages, similar to the MPAA's "G" rating), deciding that "whilst the film may move children emotionally during the film's duration, it could not seriously trouble them once the spell of the story is broken and a 'U' certificate was therefore quite appropriate".&lt;ref name="BBFC Examiners Report 15th February 1978"&gt;BBFC Examiners Report 15 February 1978 http://www.bbfc.co.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/Watership-Down-report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the BBFC admitted that it had "received complaints about the suitability of Watership Down at U almost every year since its classification".&lt;ref name="BBFC Centenary Archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/_featured/2012/04/from-the-archive-viewing-a-repressive-rabbit-regime|title=From the Archive… viewing a "repressive rabbit regime" «  British Board of Film Classification|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409195521/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/_featured/2012/04/from-the-archive-viewing-a-repressive-rabbit-regime|archivedate=9 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. the film was rated PG due to the violent scenes.

This attitude was extended when the animated [[Watership Down (TV series)|''Watership Down'' TV series]] was marketed with the producers making an effort to reassure parents that the violence had been softened and that the main characters would not be permanently harmed in their adventures. Although the third season took a slightly darker tone to try and attract more of an audience, the season only aired in North America, Germany, and Greece.

Some marketers in the U.S. also worried that the main promotional poster appeared too dark and might scare some children. The poster is actually showing Bigwig in a snare (his distinctive fur is clearly visible), yet the image on the poster does not appear in the film, which contains a far bloodier depiction of the scene.

===Music===
The musical score was by [[Angela Morley]] and [[Malcolm Williamson]], Morley replacing Williamson after the composer had fallen behind and only composed the prelude and main title theme in sketch form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelamorley.com/site/watercues.htm|title=Angela Morley – Watership Down cue sheets|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of the musical cues for the film can be found on the composer's website, which also gives information about the different composers working on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelamorley.com/site/wd-cue1.htm|title=Angela Morley – Watership Down music cues  (page 1)|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soundtrack includes [[Art Garfunkel]]'s British No. 1 hit, "[[Bright Eyes (Art Garfunkel song)|Bright Eyes]]", which was written by the British singer and songwriter [[Mike Batt]]. He also wrote other songs for the film which were not used. The composer recorded three songs with vocals by Garfunkel, but only "Bright Eyes" made it to the film. The song "When You're Losing Your Way in the Rain" has a very similar feeling and arrangement, and was recorded by the former Zombies vocalist [[Colin Blunstone]] in 1979. Garfunkel's version was heard years later, on the TV series soundtrack released in 2000. The song, like many others which appeared on the TV soundtrack, was never used in the show.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
The film was an immediate success at the UK box office and has received a mostly positive critical reception, with an 82% 'Fresh' rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 33 reviews. The critical consensus reads: "Aimed at adults perhaps more than children, this is a respectful, beautifully animated adaptation of Richard Adams' beloved book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/watership_down |title= Watership Down |date=1 November 1978 |publisher= [[Fandango Media]] |access-date=29 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film was nominated for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} In 2004, the magazine ''[[Total Film]]'' named ''Watership Down'' the 47th greatest British film of all time and it was also ranked 15th in the "100 Greatest Tearjerkers".{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Investors in the film reportedly received a return of 5,000% on their investment.&lt;ref name="icon"&gt;Alexander Walker, ''Icons in the Fire: The Rise and Fall of Practically Everyone in the British Film Industry 1984–2000'', Orion Books, 2005 p6&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its success at the UK box office, the film underperformed at the US box office, earning only US$3 million against a budget of $4 million.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Rating controversy===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
The [[British Board of Film Classification]] have been criticized for declaring Watership Down as a U rating, which is intended for anyone at least 4 years of age. The film was released to theatres in the UK before the PG rating was created in the UK, but had never been rerated after the PG rating came. The fact that the film is an animation about rabbits makes many unaware parents mistake the film for being a typical child-friendly film, arguing that the frequency of gore, death, and disturbing imagery should have resulted in at least a 'parental guidance' rating. Some places like Quebec have given the film a G rating as well; however, in places like the United States, Australia, and Ireland, the film was rated PG due to the film's violence and disturbing imagery.

==Media==

===Picture book===
A picture book of the animated film was also produced, titled ''The Watership Down Film Picture Book''. Two editions of the book were published, one a hard-cover, the other a reinforced cloth-bound edition. The contents include stills from the film linked with a combination of narration and extracts from the script, as well as a preface written by Richard Adams and a foreword written by Martin Rosen.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

'''Wetpaint''' is an internet company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Function(X). Founded in 2005, Wetpaint both publishes the website Wetpaint Entertainment, focused on entertainment news, and develops a proprietary technology platform, the Social Distribution System, that is used to provide analytics for its own website as well as other online publishers'. Wetpaint began as a [[wiki farm]], hosting [[wiki]]s using its own proprietary software, before moving into hosting of professional content in 2010. Wetpaint's wiki-hosting component was spun off completely in 2013 after being purchased by Wikifoundry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url = http://www.wikifoundrycentral.com/thread/5139827/Wet+Paint+Wiki | title = Wet Paint Wiki - WikiFoundry Central | date = 2013-09-01 | access-date = 2017-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Wetpaint was originally called Wikisphere, and begun as a [[wiki farm]], hosting [[wiki]]s using proprietary software. It was co-founded in October 2005 by Ben Elowitz, who had previously co-founded the online jewelry retailer [[Blue Nile Inc.]] In December 2005, the company and site were renamed to Wetpaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://blog.seattlepi.com/venture/archives/100675.asp | title = Startup Wikisphere changes its name to Wetpaint | publisher = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date = 2005-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2005, the company received its initial A round of venture capital funding of USD5.25 million from Trinity Ventures and Frazier Technology Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.seattlepi.com/business/246734_wiki02.html | title = Startup Wikisphere raises $5.25 million in 1st round | publisher = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date = 2005-11-02 | first1=John | last1=Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetpaint closed a USD9.5 million 'B' round of funding in January 2007, adding [[Accel Partners]] to the list of investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=21412&amp;hed=Wiki+Providers+Score+Funding&amp;sector=Industries&amp;subsector=InternetAndServices | title = Wiki Providers Score Funding | publisher = [[Red Herring (magazine)|Red Herring]] | date = 2007-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetpaint closed a Series C round of venture capital funding of USD25 million in May 2008. Investors included Accel Partners, Trinity Ventures, and Frazier Technology Ventures.

Wetpaint was named by ''[[Time Magazine]]'' as one of the 50 Best Websites of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1633488_1633608_1633634,00.html | title = Wetpaint.com - 50 Best Websites 2007 | publisher = [[Time Magazine]] | date = 2007-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, Wetpaint added [[social networking]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Wetpaint Goes Social | url = http://press.wetpaint.com/page/Wetpaint+Goes+Social | work = press release | publisher = Wetpaint | date = 2008-03-10 | accessdate = 2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Wetpaint laid off 15 of their 56 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2009/07/27/seattle-layoff-update-targeted-genetics-wetpaint-google-and-others-cut-staff/ | title = Seattle Layoff Update:Targeted Genetics, Wetpaint, Google, and Others Cut Staff | publisher = xconomy | date = 2009-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 9 employees, including co-founders Kevin Flaherty and Alex Berg, were laid off in December.&lt;ref name="cuts staff"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2009/12/exclusive_wetpaint_cuts_staff_changes_focus_to_online_publishing.html | title = Exclusive: Wetpaint cuts staff, changes focus to publishing | publisher = John Cook, TechFlash | date = 2009-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also decided to refocus the website on professionally created content. Both steps were taken as a result of declining online ad revenue.&lt;ref name="cuts staff" /&gt;

During late 2009, Wetpaint re-launched its main homepage, at wetpaint.com, as the Wetpaint Entertainment platform, a set of new online TV fan destination sites, geared toward the female 18-34 demographic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10852711/wetpaint-launches-online-tv-fan-destination-with-coverage-of-this-falls-most-anticipated-tv-programs.html Wetpaint Launches Online TV Fan Destination With Coverage Of This Fall's Most Anticipated TV Programs]&lt;/ref&gt; The wiki farm was renamed "Wikis by Wetpaint", and was moved to the domain wetpaintcentral.com.

In December 2010, the company announced the Wetpaint Social Distribution System.&lt;ref name="prweb.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wetpaint Entertainment Rapidly Becomes a Leading Online Entertainment News Source Due to Wetpaint’s Proprietary Social Distribution System|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/12/prweb9044567.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, Wetpaint was acquired by Viggle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20131216-907355.html | title = Viggle Acquires Wetpaint | publisher = Press Release | date = 2013-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an entertainment rewards platform, which was shortly renamed to its former name, Function(X).

'''''You Me Bum Bum Train''''' is an [[Interactive theatre]] performance devised by Kate Bond and Morgan Lloyd in 2004. The pair met as art students in Brighton, where they were studying illustration and film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/you-me-bum-bum-train-all-aboard-for-the-ride-of-a-lifetime-a2473106.html ''Evening Standard'' interview, 11 August 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''You Me Bum Bum Train'' gained critical acclaim in the United Kingdom when it was awarded the [[Samuel Beckett Award|Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust prize]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbican.org.uk/news/artformnews/theatredance/you-me-bum-bum-train |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |title=Barbican announces Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust award-winner|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730232240/http://www.barbican.org.uk/news/artformnews/theatredance/you-me-bum-bum-train |archivedate=July 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while showing in a disused office in London. In 2010 it won the [[Evening Standard Theatre Award]] for outstanding newcomer. 

It returned in 2012 in a former postal depot in [[Holborn]], and a new version of the show – at Empire House in Stratford, east London in 2012 – was nominated for an [[Olivier Award]] for Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item137190/outstanding-achievement-in-an-affiliate-theatre/ |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |title=Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre - Olivier Awards|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402194001/http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item137190/outstanding-achievement-in-an-affiliate-theatre/ |archivedate=April 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the show was mounted again, this time in at what had been [[Foyles]] bookshop on London's [[Charing Cross Road]] where their last show, started on 25 February 2016, finished on 29 April.

==Overview==
Visitors to the performance pass through a series of scenes of which they have no foreknowledge, in which they are either passive or where they must improvise a part without any preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Dickson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/11/best-theatre-2012-you-me-bum |title=Best theatre of 2012, No 9: You Me Bum Bum Train &amp;#124; Stage |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna Hanra, writing for ''Vice'', described it as a series of "highly detailed, absurd real life scenarios following one another on a nonsense high-paced narrative".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/you-me-bum-bum-train-378 ''Vice'' interview, 19 June 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The entertainment magazine ''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed &amp; Confused]]'' reported; "What was one of London's more obtuse treasures is set to become one of Great Britain's proudest moments." ''[[The Times]]'' said; "It leaves you questioning everything, and it's lots of fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/style/article1480556.ece|title=Album review|newspaper=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] magazine wrote; "My highlight of 2008 was You Me Bum Bum Train, if only real life were that interesting."

''You Me Bum Bum Train'' has provoked controversy due to the fact that none of the performers gets paid, though the directors stress that performers and crew are involved on a voluntary basis, that many are not trained professionals and that they are under no obligation to stay during performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnett|first=Laura|title=You Me Bum Bum Train gives actors a bad ride, says union|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/13/you-me-bum-bum-train-equity|accessdate=14 July 2012|newspaper=Theguardian.co.uk|date=13 July 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2010/07/equity-warns-sell-out-show-of-possible-minimum-wage-breach/|title=Equity warns sell-out show of possible minimum wage breach - News - The Stage|author=Natalie Woolman|work=Thestage.co.uk|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was criticized for its ticketing system which caused problems for ticket buyers in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2015/ticketing-bum-bum-train-fire/|title=Ticketing for You Me Bum Bum Train under fire - Carousel, News - The Stage|author=Matthew Hemley|work=Thestage.co.uk|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 the trade union Equity criticised their £150,000 Arts Council England funding as YMBBT were advertising for professional dancers but were not paying them, despite selling tickets "at rates typical of a West End show." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.equity.org.uk/news-and-events/equity-news/equity-questions-arts-council-funding-decision/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eventmagazine.co.uk/bum-bum-train-comes-fire-actors-union/agencies/article/1374456&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 the trade union BECTU criticised YMBBT for "exploiting workers after advertising for unpaid production interns." BECTU launched an investigation concerning "the legality of the “outrageous” internships, which would see successful applicants work at least two days each week for a minimum four hours each day." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2016/bectu-launches-probe-exploitative-bum-bum-train-internships/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/2016/alistair-smith-show-producers-pay-stance-hits-a-bum-note/&lt;/ref&gt;
