The '''A4260''' is a [[road]] that leads from the [[A422 road|A422 Henneff Way]], [[Banbury]] to Frieze Way near [[Oxford]].  It is single carriageway for a majority of the route, except for a section near [[Steeple Aston]] for {{Convert|0.9|mi}} and on Frieze Way where the A4260 meets the A34 at Peartree Interchange, [[Oxford]], where it becomes a [[dual carriageway]]. The road passes through [[Bodicote]], [[Adderbury]], [[Deddington]] and [[Kidlington|Kidlington, Oxfordshire]]. The road terminates at the [[A44 road]] roundabout at Frieze Way which is just north of [[Oxford]]. Until 1990 it was part of the [[A423 road|A423]] and the major route from Banbury to Oxford.  It was renumbered to encourage the traffic that formerly used this route to use the [[M40 motorway|M40]].

'''Angular resolution''' or '''spatial resolution''' describes the ability of any [[image-forming device]] such as an [[Optical telescope|optical]] or [[radio telescope]], a [[microscope]], a [[camera]], or an [[Human eye|eye]], to distinguish small details of an object, thereby making it a major determinant of [[image resolution]]. In [[physics]] and geosciences, the term ''spatial resolution'' refers to the precision of a [[measurement]] with respect to space.

==Definition of terms==

''Resolving power'' is the ability of an imaging device to separate (i.e., to see as distinct) points of an object that are located at a small [[angular separation|angular distance]] or it is the power of an optical instrument to separate far away objects, that are close together, into individual images. The term ''[[Optical resolution|resolution]]'' or ''minimum resolvable distance'' is the minimum distance between distinguishable [[object (image processing)|objects]] in an image, although the term is loosely used by many users of microscopes and telescopes to describe resolving power. In scientific analysis, in general, the term "resolution" is used to describe the [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] with which any instrument measures and records (in an image or spectrum) any variable in the specimen or sample under study.

==Explanation==
[[File:Airy disk spacing near Rayleigh criterion.png|thumb|right|Airy diffraction patterns generated by light from two points passing through a circular aperture, such as the pupil of the [[Human eye|eye]]. Points far apart (top) or meeting the Rayleigh criterion (middle) can be distinguished. Points closer than the Rayleigh criterion (bottom) are difficult to distinguish.]]
The imaging system's resolution can be limited either by [[Optical aberration|aberration]] or by [[diffraction]] causing [[Focus (optics)|blurring]] of the image. These two phenomena have different origins and are unrelated. Aberrations can be explained by geometrical optics and can in principle be solved by increasing the optical quality — and consequently the cost — of the system. On the other hand, diffraction comes from the wave nature of light and is determined by the finite aperture of the optical elements. The [[lens (optics)|lens]]' circular [[aperture]] is analogous to a two-dimensional version of the [[Slit experiment|single-slit experiment]]. [[Light]] passing through the lens [[Interference (wave propagation)|interferes]] with itself creating a ring-shape diffraction pattern, known as the [[Airy pattern]], if the [[wavefront]] of the transmitted light is taken to be spherical or plane over the exit aperture.

The interplay between diffraction and aberration can be characterised by the [[point spread function]]&lt;!--Maybe should go after--&gt; (PSF). The narrower the aperture of a lens the more likely the PSF is dominated by diffraction. In that case, the angular resolution of an optical system can be estimated (from the [[diameter]] of the aperture and the [[wavelength]] of the light) by the Rayleigh criterion defined by [[Lord Rayleigh]]: two point sources are regarded as just resolved when the principal diffraction maximum of one image coincides with the first minimum of the other.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the distance is greater, the two points are well resolved and if it is smaller, they are regarded as not resolved. Rayleigh defended this criteria on sources of equal strength.&lt;ref name=rayleigy1879 /&gt;

Considering diffraction through a circular aperture, this translates into:
:&lt;math&gt; \theta=1.220 \frac{\lambda}{D}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''θ'' is the ''angular resolution'' ([[radians]]), ''λ'' is the [[wavelength]] of light, and ''D'' is the [[diameter]] of the lens' aperture. The factor 1.220 is derived from a calculation of the position of the first dark circular ring surrounding the central [[Airy disc]] of the [[diffraction]] pattern. This number is more precisely 1.21966989... ({{OEIS2C|A245461}}), the first zero of the order-one [[Bessel function of the first kind]] &lt;math&gt;J_{1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; divided by [[pi|π]].

The formal Rayleigh criterion is close to the [[empirical]] resolution limit found earlier by the English astronomer [[W. R. Dawes]] who tested human observers on close binary stars of equal brightness. The result, ''θ'' = 4.56/''D'', with ''D'' in inches and ''θ'' in [[arcsecond]]s is slightly narrower than calculated with the Rayleigh criterion: A calculation using Airy discs as point spread function shows that at [[Dawes' limit]]&lt;!-- that stub may redirect here --&gt; there is a 5% dip between the two maxima, whereas at Rayleigh's criterion there is a 26.3% dip.&lt;ref name="Michalet2006"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[image processing]] techniques including [[deconvolution]] of the point spread function allow resolution of binaries with even less angular separation.

The angular resolution may be converted into a ''spatial resolution'', Δ''ℓ'', by multiplication of the angle (in radians) with the distance to the object. For a microscope, that distance is close to the [[focal length]] ''f'' of the [[Objective (optics)|objective]]. For this case, the Rayleigh criterion reads:
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \ell = 1.220 \frac{ f \lambda}{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

This is the size, in the imaging plane, of smallest object that the lens can resolve, and also the [[radius]] of the smallest spot to which a [[collimated]] beam of [[light]] can be focused.&lt;ref&gt;

 |archivedate=2011-07-08 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size is proportional to wavelength, ''λ'', and thus, for example, [[blue]] light can be focused to a smaller spot than [[red]] light. If the lens is focusing a beam of [[light]] with a finite extent (e.g., a [[laser]] beam), the value of ''D'' corresponds to the [[diameter]] of the light beam, not the lens.{{ref|GaussianNote|Note}} Since the spatial resolution is inversely proportional to ''D'', this leads to the slightly surprising result that a wide beam of light may be focused to a smaller spot than a narrow one. This result is related to the [[Fourier uncertainty principle|Fourier properties]] of a lens.

A similar result holds for a small sensor imaging a subject at infinity: The angular resolution can be converted to a spatial resolution on the sensor by using ''f'' as the distance to the image sensor; this relates the spatial resolution of the image to the [[f-number]], {{f/}}#:
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \ell \approx 1.220 \frac{f \lambda}{D}=1.22 \lambda \cdot (f/\#)&lt;/math&gt;.
Since this is the radius of the Airy disk, the resolution is better estimated by the diameter, &lt;math&gt; 2.44 \lambda \cdot (f/\#)&lt;/math&gt;

==Specific cases==
[[Image:Diffraction limit diameter vs angular resolution.svg|thumb|Log-log plot of aperture diameter vs angular resolution at the diffraction limit for various light wavelengths compared with various astronomical instruments. For example, the blue star shows that the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] is almost diffraction-limited in the visible spectrum at 0.1 arcsecs, whereas the red circle shows that the human eye should have a resolving power of 20 arcsecs in theory, though normally only 60 arcsecs.]]

===Single telescope===

Point-like sources separated by an [[angle]] smaller than the angular resolution cannot be resolved. A single optical telescope may have an angular resolution less than one [[arcsecond]], but [[astronomical seeing]] and other atmospheric effects make attaining this very hard.

The angular resolution ''R'' of a telescope can usually be approximated by
:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac {\lambda}{D} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ'' is the [[wavelength]] of the observed radiation, and ''D'' is the diameter of the telescope's [[Objective (optics)|objective]]. The Resulting ''R'' is in [[radian]]s. For example, in the case of yellow light with a wavelength of 580&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]], for a resolution of 0.1 arc second, we need D=1.2&amp;nbsp;m. Sources larger than the angular resolution are called extended sources or diffuse sources, and smaller sources are called point sources.

This formula, for light with a wavelength of about 562&amp;nbsp;nm, is also called the [[Dawes' limit]].

===Telescope array===
The highest angular resolutions can be achieved by arrays of telescopes called [[astronomical interferometer]]s: These instruments can achieve angular resolutions of 0.001&amp;nbsp;arcsecond at optical wavelengths, and much higher resolutions at x-ray wavelengths. In order to perform [[aperture synthesis|aperture synthesis imaging]], a large number of telescopes are required laid out in a 2-dimensional arrangement with a dimensional precision better than a fraction (0.25x) of the required image resolution.

The angular resolution ''R'' of an interferometer array can usually be approximated by
:&lt;math&gt;R=\frac {\lambda}{B} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ'' is the [[wavelength]] of the observed radiation, and ''B'' is the length of the maximum physical separation of the telescopes in the array, called the [[baseline (interferometry)|baseline]]. The resulting ''R'' is in [[radian]]s. Sources larger than the angular resolution are called extended sources or diffuse sources, and smaller sources are called point sources.

For example, in order to form an image in yellow light with a wavelength of 580&amp;nbsp;nm, for a resolution of 1&amp;nbsp;milli-arcsecond, we need telescopes laid out in an array that is 120&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;120&amp;nbsp;m with a dimensional precision better than 145&amp;nbsp;nm.

===Microscope===
The resolution ''R'' (here measured as a distance, not to be confused with the angular resolution of a previous subsection) depends on the [[angular aperture]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |last1=Davidson |first1=M. W.
 |title=Resolution
 |url=https://www.microscopyu.com/microscopy-basics/resolution
 |website=Nikon’s MicroscopyU
 |publisher=[[Nikon]]
 |accessdate=2017-02-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{1.22\lambda}{\mathrm{NA}_\text{condenser} + \mathrm{NA}_\text{objective}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NA}=n\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

Here NA is the [[numerical aperture]], &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is half the included angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of the lens, which depends on the diameter of the lens and its focal length, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]] of the medium between the lens and the specimen, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength of light illuminating or emanating from (in the case of fluorescence microscopy) the sample.

It follows that the NAs of both the objective and the condenser should be as high as possible for maximum resolution. In the case that both NAs are the same, the equation may be reduced to:
:&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{0.61\lambda}{\mathrm{NA}}\approx\frac{\lambda}{2\mathrm{NA}}&lt;/math&gt;

The practical limit for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is about 70°. In a dry objective or condenser, this gives a maximum NA of 0.95. In a high-resolution [[oil immersion objective|oil immersion lens]], the maximum NA is typically 1.45, when using immersion oil with a refractive index of 1.52. Due to these limitations, the resolution limit of a light microscope using [[visible light]] is about 200&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]]. Given that the shortest wavelength of visible light is [[Violet (color)|violet]] (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 400&amp;nbsp;nm),

:&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{1.22 \times 400\,\mbox{nm}}{1.45\ +\ 0.95}=203\,\mbox{nm}&lt;/math&gt;

which is near 200&amp;nbsp;nm.

Oil immersion objectives can have practical difficulties due to their shallow depth of field and extremely short working distance, which calls for the use of very thin (0.17&amp;nbsp;mm) cover slips, or, in an inverted microscope, thin glass-bottomed [[Petri dish]]es.

However, resolution below this theoretical limit can be achieved using [[super-resolution microscopy]]. These include optical near-fields ([[Near-field scanning optical microscope]]) or a diffraction technique called [[4Pi STED microscopy]]. Objects as small as 30&amp;nbsp;nm have been resolved with both techniques.&lt;ref name=pohl&gt;

==Notes==
{{note|GaussianNote}}In the case of laser beams, a [[Gaussian beam|Gaussian Optics]] analysis is more appropriate than the Rayleigh criterion, and may reveal a smaller diffraction-limited spot size than that indicated by the formula above.

The '''Ansari X Prize''' was a [[space competition]] in which the [[X Prize Foundation]] offered a [[United States dollar|US$]]10,000,000 [[prize]] for the first [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organization]] to launch a reusable [[manned spaceflight|manned spacecraft]] into [[outer space|space]] twice within two weeks.  It was modeled after early 20th-century [[aviation]] prizes, and aimed to spur development of low-cost spaceflight.

Created in May 1996 and initially called just the "X Prize", it was renamed the "Ansari X Prize" on May 6, 2004 following a multimillion-dollar [[donation]] from [[entrepreneur]]s [[Anousheh Ansari]] and [[Amir Ansari]].

The prize was won on October 4, 2004, the 47th anniversary of the [[Sputnik 1]] launch, by the [[Scaled Composites Tier One|Tier One]] project designed by [[Burt Rutan]] and financed by Microsoft co-founder [[Paul Allen]], using the experimental [[spaceplane]] [[SpaceShipOne]].  $10 million was awarded to the winner, and more than $100 million was invested in new technologies in pursuit of the prize.

Several other [[X Prize]]s have since been announced by the [[X Prize Foundation]], promoting further development in [[space exploration]] and other technological fields.

==Motivation==
The X Prize was inspired by the [[Orteig Prize]]—the 1919 prize worth 25,000 dollars offered by New York hotel owner [[Raymond Orteig]] that encouraged a number of intrepid aviators in the mid-1920s to fly across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]—which was ultimately won in 1927 by [[Charles Lindbergh]] in his aircraft ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''.  In reading the book, ''[[The Spirit of St. Louis (book)|The Spirit of St. Louis]]'' during 1994, [[Peter Diamandis]] realized that "such a prize, updated and offered ... as a ''space'' prize, might be just what was needed to bring space travel to the general public, to jump-start a commercial space industry."&lt;!-- emphasis in original --&gt;&lt;ref name=belfiore2007&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Belfiore|first1=Michael |title=Rocketeers: how a visionary band of business leaders, engineers, and pilots is boldly privatizing space |date=2007 |publisher=Smithsonian Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-114903-0 |page=&lt;!-- use 'rp' template following to allow multiple reference --&gt; |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6NlCK_8h_4C |accessdate=2014-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15–17}}

Diamandis developed a fully formed idea for a "suborbital space [[barnstorming]] prize", and set an initial goal of finding backers to support a {{USD|10 million}} prize.  He named it the X Prize, in part because "X" could serve as a variable for the name of the person who might later back the prize; any craft built to win the prize would be experimental, and a long line of experimental aircraft built for the US Air Force had been so designated, including the [[X-15]] that was, [[X-15 Flight 90|in 1963]], the first government-built craft to carry a human into space; and because "Ten is the [[Roman numeral]] X".&lt;ref name=belfiore2007/&gt;{{rp|17}}

The X Prize was first publicly proposed by Diamandis in an address to the [[National Space Society|NSS]] [[International Space Development Conference]] in 1995.  The competition goal was adopted from the [[SpaceCub]] project, demonstration of a private vehicle capable of flying a pilot to the edge of space, defined as 100&amp;nbsp;km altitude.  This goal was selected to help encourage the space industry in the [[private sector]], which is why the entries were not allowed to have any government funding. It aimed to demonstrate that [[spaceflight]] can be affordable and accessible to corporations and civilians, opening the door to [[Private spaceflight|commercial spaceflight]] and [[space tourism]]. It is also hoped that competition will breed [[innovation]], introducing new low-cost methods of reaching [[Earth orbit]], and ultimately pioneering low-cost [[Spaceflight|space travel]] and unfettered [[space colonization|human expansion]] into the [[solar system]].

[[NASA]] is developing a similar prize program called [[Centennial Challenges]] to generate innovative solutions to [[space technology]] problems.

==Winning team==
[[Image:Ansari X-Prize Check.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Representatives of the X Prize Foundation symbolically presented the ten million dollar prize to [[Burt Rutan]] and [[Paul Allen]] of [[Mojave Aerospace Ventures]] on November 6, 2004.  The Ansari X Prize trophy is on the left.]]
The [[Scaled Composites Tier One|Tier One]] project made two successful competitive flights: [[SpaceShipOne flight 16P|X1]] on September 29, 2004, piloted by [[Mike Melvill]] to 102.9&amp;nbsp;km; and [[SpaceShipOne flight 17P|X2]] on October 4, 2004, piloted by [[Brian Binnie]] to 112&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3712998.stm|title=SpaceShipOne rockets to success|publisher=BBC news|date=7 October 2005|accessdate=9 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101028134020/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3712998.stm| archivedate= 28 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They thus won the prize, which was awarded on November 6, 2004. In press coverage, the winning team has been variously referred to as [[Mojave Aerospace Ventures]], the corporation that funded the attempt; [[Scaled Composites Tier One|Tier One]], the project name of Mojave's contest entry; and [[Scaled Composites]], the manufacturer of the craft.

As of 2011, the trophy is on display in the [[Saint Louis Science Center]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

==Flight attempts by teams that did not win==
{{noreferences|section|date=January 2018}}
Although only the Tier One team actually launched a spacecraft into suborbital space, several other teams have conducted low-altitude tests or announced future plans to launch into space:&lt;ref name="belfiore2007" /&gt;
* [[ARCA (NGO)|ARCA]] launched Demonstrator 2B rocket on September 9, 2004 at Cape Midia Air Force Base in Romania. It was the first flight of a reusable monopropellant rocket.
* The [[da Vinci Project]] originally announced that their first flight would be on October 2, 2004, but this was postponed indefinitely on September 23, 2004, as they were unable to obtain a few necessary components in time. No flight ever occurred.
* The [[Canadian Arrow]] team conducted a successful full-power engine test in 2005 and announced on June 2, 2005, that it had received permission from the Canadian government to use [[Cape Rich]] as a future launch site.
* On August 8, 2004, Space Transport Corporation's ''Rubicon 1'' and [[Armadillo Aerospace]]'s unnamed test vehicle, in two separate unmanned test launches, both crashed and were destroyed.
* On February 15, 2005, AERA Corporation (formerly American Astronautics) announced its plans to send seven paying passengers into space as early as 2006, a full year before the first announced speculative [[Virgin Galactic]] flight.

==Organization==
{{main|X Prize Foundation}}
With the Ansari X Prize, the [[X Prize Foundation]] (based in Santa Monica, CA) established a philanthropic model in which offering a prize for achieving a specific goal stimulates entrepreneurial investment that produces a tenfold or greater return on the prize purse and at least one hundredfold in follow-on investment and social benefit.  The Foundation has developed into a non-profit prize institute that conceives, designs and manages public competitions for the benefit of humanity.

==Funding==
The funding for the [[United States dollar|US $]]10,000,000 [[prize]] was unconventional in being "backed by an insurance policy to guarantee that the $10 million is in place on the day that the prize is won." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Interview with Peter Diamandis|date=2003-03-01|accessdate=2010-01-22|url=http://www.hobbyspace.com/AAdmin/archive/Interviews/Advocacy/PeterDiamandis.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100207035241/http://hobbyspace.com/AAdmin/archive/Interviews/Advocacy/PeterDiamandis.html| archivedate= 7 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamandis referred to this as a "[[hole-in-one insurance]] policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Space|date=|url=http://feeds.wnyc.org/~r/radiolab/~3/bsHn-oaujEU/23|publisher=Feeds.wync.org|accessdate=28 December 2014}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs==
The success of the X Prize competition has spurred spin-offs that are set up in the same way. There have been two major spin-offs at this point, the first of which is the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize|M Prize]] (short for Methuselah Mouse Prize), which is a prize set up by [[University of Cambridge]] [[biogerontology|biogerontologist]] [[Aubrey de Grey]] which will go to the scientific team that successfully extends the life or reverses the aging of mice, which would then eventually be available to humans. The second is the NASA [[Centennial Challenges]], which consist of (among others) the [[Tether Challenge]] in which teams compete to develop superstrong tethers as a component to [[space elevator]]s, and the [[Beam Power Challenge]] which encourages ideas for transmitting power wirelessly. An independent spin-off called the [[N-Prize]] was started by [[Cambridge]] [[Microbiologist]] Paul H. Dear in 2007, designed to foster research into low-cost orbital launchers.

The X Prize foundation itself is developing additional prizes: the  [[Archon X Prize]], to advance research in the field of [[genomics]]; the [[Automotive X Prize]], an engineering competition to create a fuel efficient clean car;  the [[Wirefly X Prize Cup]], an annually held air &amp; space exposition featuring space-related competitions and rocketry, and the [[Google Lunar X Prize]], a competition for privately funded lunar exploration. Of several awards on offer, the largest—$20 million—will be awarded to the first privately funded team to produce a robot that lands on the [[Moon]] and travels 500m (1,640 ft) across its surface. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=184|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lunar.xprize.org/about/guidelines&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a possible "[[H-Prize]]", focused on [[hydrogen vehicle]] research, although this goal has been addressed by [[H.R. 5143]], an X-Prize-inspired bill passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]], which was later folded into the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R.5143 - H-Prize Act of 2006|date=|accessdate=2015-10-11|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/5143|publisher=Congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apfel Glacier''' ({{Coord|66|25|S|100|35|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] about {{convert|5|nmi|km|-1}} wide and {{convert|20|nmi|km|-1}} long, flowing west-northwest along the south flank of the [[Bunger Hills]] and terminating in [[Edisto Ice Tongue]]. It was mapped from air photos taken by [[U.S. Navy Operation Highjump]], 1946–47, and named by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] for [[Earl T. Apfel]], professor of geology at [[Syracuse University]], who served as geologist with the [[U.S. Navy Operation Windmill]] parties, 1947–48, which established astronomical control stations along [[Queen Mary Coast|Queen Mary]], [[Knox Coast|Knox]] and [[Budd Coast|Budd]] Coasts.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt;

The '''Apollo–Soyuz Test Project''' ('''ASTP''') ({{lang-ru|Экспериментальный полёт «Аполлон» - «Союз» (ЭПАС)}}, ''Eksperimentalniy polyot Apollon-Soyuz'', lit. "Experimental flight Apollo-Soyuz", commonly referred to by the Soviets as "'''Soyuz-Apollo'''"), conducted in July 1975, was the first joint U.S.–[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Space exploration|space flight]], as a symbol of the policy of [[détente]] that the two superpowers were pursuing at the time. It involved the docking of an [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] with the Soviet [[#Soyuz crew|Soyuz 19]]. The unnumbered Apollo vehicle was a surplus from the terminated [[Apollo program]] and the last one to fly. This mission ceremoniously marked the end of the [[Space Race]] that had begun in 1957 with the [[Sputnik]] launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K751AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT747#v=onepage&amp;q=Apollo-Soyuz&amp;f=false |access-date=May 25, 2016 |title=Encyclopedia of United States National Security |ISBN=978-0-7619-2927-7 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |editor-first=Richard J. |editor-last=Samuels |editor-link=Richard J.

[…] The formal end of the space race occurred with the 1975 joint Apollo-Soyuz mission, in which U.S. and Soviet spacecraft docked, or joined, in orbit while their crews visited one another's craft and performed joint scientific experiments.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission included both joint and separate scientific experiments (including an engineered [[solar eclipse|eclipse of the Sun]] by Apollo to allow Soyuz to take photographs of the solar [[corona]]), and provided useful engineering experience for future joint US–Russian space flights, such as the [[Shuttle–Mir Program]] and the [[International Space Station]].

ASTP was the last manned US space mission until the first [[Space Shuttle]] flight in April 1981. It was also U.S. astronaut [[Deke Slayton|Donald "Deke" Slayton]]'s only space flight. He was chosen as one of the original [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts in April 1959, but had been grounded until 1972 for medical reasons.

== Historical background ==
[[File:Nixon Kosygin May 1972.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. President Richard Nixon and [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Alexei Kosygin]] (seated) sign an agreement paving the way for the Apollo–Soyuz flight, May 1972.]]
The purpose and catalyst of the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project was the policy of [[détente]] between the two [[Cold War]] superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. Prior to this mission, tensions remained high between the two world superpowers while the United States was engaged in the [[Vietnam War]]. Meanwhile, the Soviet press was highly critical of the Apollo space missions, printing "the armed intrusion of the United States and Saigon puppets into Laos is a shameless trampling underfoot of international law" over a photograph of the [[Apollo 14]] launch in 1971.&lt;ref name="Space Sciences 1976"&gt;Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, Soviet Space Programs, 1971–75. Washington: U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] made the Soviet Union's policy of détente official in his 1956 doctrine of peaceful coexistence at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], the two nations seemed to be in perpetual conflict.

Due to tense relations, space cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union was unlikely in the early 1970s. On June 7, 1971, the USSR had launched the first piloted orbital space station, [[Salyut 1]]. Meanwhile, the United States had launched the Apollo 14 mission several months prior, the third spacecraft to land humans on the moon. Each side gave the other little coverage whatsoever of their achievements.&lt;ref name="Space Sciences 1976" /&gt;

Both sides had severe criticisms of the other side's engineering. Soviet spacecraft were designed with automation in mind; the [[Lunokhod 1]] and [[Luna 16]] were both unmanned probes, and each [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] had been designed to minimize risk due to human error by having fewer manual controls with which human operators would have to contend during flight. By contrast, the Apollo spacecraft was designed to be operated by humans and required highly trained astronauts in order to operate. The Soviet Union criticised the Apollo spacecraft as being "extremely complex and dangerous".&lt;ref name="Space Sciences 1976" /&gt;

The Americans also had their own concerns about Soviet spacecraft. [[Christopher C. Kraft]], director of the [[Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]], criticized the design of the Soyuz: "We in [[NASA]] rely on redundant components--if an instrument fails during flight, our crews switch to another in an attempt to continue the mission. Each Soyuz component, however, is designed for a specific function; if one fails, the cosmonauts land as soon as possible. The Apollo vehicle also relied on astronaut piloting to a much greater extent than did the Soyuz machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ezell|first1=Edward|last2=Ezell|first2=Linda|title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|date=1978|chapter=Foreword|chapter-url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4209/forwrd.htm|publisher=NASA|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4209/toc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; American and Soviet engineers already settled their differences for a possible docking of American and Soviet spacecraft in meetings between June and December 1971 in Houston and Moscow, including [[Bill Creasy]]'s design of the [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System]] between the two ships that would allow either to be active or passive during docking.&lt;ref name=Battaglia&gt;Debbora Battaglia, "Arresting Hospitality: the Case of the 'Handshake in Space'," Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute vol. 18 issue 1 June 2012. p. S76-S89&lt;/ref&gt;

With the close of the Vietnam War, relations between the United States and the USSR began to improve, as did the prognosis for a potential cooperative space mission.&lt;ref name="Space Sciences 1976" /&gt; The Apollo–Soyuz Test Project was made possible by the thaw in these relations, and the project itself endeavored to amplify and solidify the improving relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. According to Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], "The Soviet and American spacemen will go up into outer space for the first major joint scientific experiment in the history of mankind. They know that from outer space our planet looks even more beautiful. It is big enough for us to live peacefully on it, but it is too small to be threatened by nuclear war".&lt;ref name="Space Sciences 1976" /&gt; Thus, both sides recognized ASTP as a political act of peace.&lt;ref name= Battaglia /&gt;

In October 1970, [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] president [[Mstislav Keldysh]] responded to [[NASA Administrator]] [[Thomas O. Paine]]'s letter proposing a cooperative space mission, and there was subsequently a meeting to discuss technical details. By January 12, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]'s Foreign Policy Adviser [[Henry Kissinger]] enthusiastically espoused plans for the mission, and expressed these views to NASA administrator George M. Low: "As long as you stick to space, do anything you want to do. You are free to commit--in fact, I want you to tell your counterparts in Moscow that the President has sent you on this mission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ezell|first1=Edward|last2=Ezell|first2=Linda|title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|date=1978|chapter=Chapter 5. Proposal for a Test Flight|chapter-url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4209/ch5-1.htm|publisher=NASA|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4209/toc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1972, both the United States and the USSR signed an [[Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes]],&lt;ref name="Jennifer Ross-Nazzal 2010, pp. 29 – 34"&gt;Jennifer Ross-Nazzal,"Détente on Earth and in Space: The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project," Organization of American Historians Magazine of History, September 2010, Volume 24, Issue 3, pp. 29 – 34.&lt;/ref&gt; committing both the USSR and the United States to the launch of the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes: Moscow, 24 May 1972. Moscow: NASA, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

ASTP was particularly significant for the USSR's policy of keeping the details of their space program secret from the Soviet people and the world at large, especially Americans. The ASTP was the first Soviet space mission to be televised in a live fashion during the launch, while in space, and during the landing.&lt;ref name="Space Sciences 1976" /&gt; Soyuz 19 was also the first Soviet spacecraft to which a foreign flight crew had access before flight; the Apollo crew were permitted to inspect it and the launch and crew training site, which was an unprecedented sharing of information with Americans about any Soviet space program.

Not all reactions to ASTP were positive. Many Americans feared that ASTP was giving the USSR too much credit in their space program, putting them on equal footing with the sophisticated space exploration efforts of NASA. More feared that the apparent peaceful cooperation between the USSR and the United States would lull people into believing there was no conflict at all between the two superpowers.&lt;ref name="Space Sciences 1976" /&gt; Soliciting appropriations from the [[United States Congress]] proved to be quite difficult, which was not a problem in the Soviet Union, and the dedication to space exploration demonstrated by the Soviet Union rejected these criticisms. Some Soviet publicists called American critics of the mission "demagogues who stand against scientific cooperation with the U.S.S.R."&lt;ref name="Space Sciences 1976" /&gt; In general, tensions between the United States and the USSR had softened, and the project set a precedent for future cooperative projects in space.&lt;ref name="Jennifer Ross-Nazzal 2010, pp. 29 – 34" /&gt;

The ASTP entailed the docking of an American [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] (CSM) with a Soviet [[Soyuz 7K-TM]] spacecraft. Although the Soyuz was given a mission designation number (Soyuz 19) as part of the ongoing [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz program]], its radio call sign was simply "Soyuz" for the duration of the joint mission. The Apollo mission was not a numbered mission of the [[Apollo program]], and similarly bore the call sign "Apollo". Despite this, some of the press and a few NASA web pages have referred to the mission as "Apollo 18", but this should not be confused with the [[canceled Apollo missions#Follow-on lunar missions|canceled lunar mission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/apollo/soyuz.html|title=Apollo-Soyuz|work=nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/journal/missions6.html|title=HEASARC Missions|work=nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/StaffordTP/TPS_BIO.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/BrandVD/BrandVD_Bio.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apollo spacecraft was launched with a docking module specially designed to enable the two spacecraft to dock with each other, used only once for this mission. The [[Saturn IB]] launch vehicle and CSM were surplus material. Like the [[Apollo Lunar Module]], the docking module [[Transposition, docking, and extraction|had to be retrieved]] from the [[S-IVB]] upper-stage of the Saturn rocket after launch. The docking module was designed as both an airlock — as the Apollo was pressurized at about {{convert|5|psi|mbar|abbr=on}} using pure oxygen, while the Soyuz used a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at [[Atmospheric pressure#Mean sea level pressure|sea level pressure]] (about 15 psi / 1000 mbar) —  and an adapter, since the surplus Apollo hardware used for the ASTP mission was not equipped with the [[APAS]] docking collar jointly developed by NASA and the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] for the mission. One end of the docking module was attached to the Apollo using the same "probe-and-[[drogue]]" docking mechanism used on the Lunar Module and the [[Skylab]] space station, while its other end had the APAS docking collar, which Soyuz 19 carried in place of the standard Soyuz/Salyut system of the time. The APAS collar fitted onto Soyuz 19 was releasable, allowing the two spacecraft to separate in case of malfunction.

The Apollo flew with a three-man crew on board: [[Thomas P. Stafford|Tom Stafford]], [[Vance Brand]], and [[Deke Slayton]]. Stafford had already flown into space three times, including within eight miles of the lunar surface as Commander of Apollo 10, and was the first [[general officer]] to fly into space.&lt;ref&gt;he was a [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Air Force]] at the time of the flight; he would retire with three stars in 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Slayton was one of the original [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts selected in 1959, but an irregular heartbeat grounded him until 1972. He became head of NASA's astronaut office and, after a lengthy medical program, selected himself for this mission. At the time, Slayton was the oldest person to fly in space and the one with the longest gap between selection as an astronaut and first flight into space. Brand, meanwhile, had trained with the Apollo spacecraft during his time as a backup [[Apollo 15]] command module pilot, and had served two stints as a backup Skylab commander. The closest he had come to flying prior to ASTP was as commander for the [[Skylab Rescue]] mission mustered to potentially retrieve the crew of [[Skylab 3]] due to a fuel leak on that mission's Apollo CSM.

The Soyuz flew with two men: [[Alexey Leonov]] and [[Valeri Kubasov]]. Leonov became the first man to [[spacewalk|walk in space]] on [[Voskhod 2]] in 1965. Kubasov, who flew on [[Soyuz 6]] in 1969, ran some of the earliest [[space manufacturing]] experiments. Both were to have flown on the ill-fated [[Soyuz 11]] in 1971 (Leonov as commander, Kubasov as the flight engineer), but were grounded because Kubasov was suspected to have [[tuberculosis]]. The two-man crew on the Soyuz was a result of the modifications needed to allow the cosmonauts to wear the [[Sokol pressure suit]] during launch, docking, and reentry.

The ASTP-class [[Soyuz 7K-TM]] spacecraft used was a variation of the post-Soyuz 11 two-man design, with the batteries replaced by [[solar panel]]s enabling "solo" flights (missions not docking to one of the [[Salyut]] space stations). It was designed to operate, during the docking phase, at a reduced nitrogen/oxygen pressure of 10.2 psi, allowing easier transfers between the Apollo and Soyuz. Six ASTP-class Soyuz spacecraft were built in total, including the one used. Before the actual mission, two craft were launched unmanned as Kosmos satellites. The third was launched as the manned [[Soyuz 16]] flight as a rehearsal in order to test the APAS docking mechanism. Another craft was used fully fueled as a "hot backup" at the launch site – later it was disassembled. And the sixth craft was available as a "cold" backup; it was later used on the [[Soyuz 22|last "solo" Soyuz flight]] in 1976, but with the APAS docking adapter replaced by the MKF-6 multispectral camera.

The Soyuz and Apollo flights launched within seven-and-a-half hours of each other on July 15, and docked on July 17. Three hours later, the two mission commanders, Stafford and Leonov, exchanged the first international handshake in space through the open hatch of the Soyuz. NASA had calculated that the historic handshake would have taken place over the British seaside resort of [[Bognor Regis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somewhere.org.uk/broadcast/pilgrims/phil/blast.htm|title=Blast-off to Bognor|last=Jones|first=Phillip|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a delay resulted in its occurrence being over the city of [[Metz]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch11-3.htm|title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project |author1=Edward Clinton Ezell |author2=Linda Neuman Ezell |year=1978|publisher=NASA|accessdate=4 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110524064713/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch11-3.htm| archivedate=May 24, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first crew exchange, the crews were read a statement from Soviet Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]], and received a phone call from U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]].

While the two ships were docked, the three Americans and two Soviets conducted joint scientific experiments, exchanged flags and gifts (including tree seeds which were later planted in the two countries), signed certificates, visited each other's ships, ate together, and conversed in each other's languages. (Because of Stafford's pronounced drawl when speaking Russian, Leonov later joked that there were three languages spoken on the mission: Russian, English, and "Oklahomski.") There were also docking and redocking maneuvers, during which the two spacecraft reversed roles and the Soyuz became the "active" ship.

American scientists developed four of the experiments performed during the mission. Embryologist [[Jane M. Oppenheimer|Jane Oppenheimer]] analyzed the effects of weightlessness on fish eggs at various stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/23/us/jane-oppenheimer-dies-at-84-expert-on-embryos-and-space.html|title=Jane Oppenheimer Dies at 84; Expert on Embryos and Space|first=Wolfgang|last=Saxon|date=March 23, 1996|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 44 hours together, the two ships separated, and maneuvered to use the Apollo to create an artificial [[solar eclipse]] to allow the crew of the Soyuz to take photographs of the solar [[corona]]. Another brief docking was made before the ships went their separate ways. The Soviets remained in space for two more days, and the Americans for five, during which the Apollo crew also conducted Earth observation experiments.

=== Re-entry and aftermath ===
The mission was considered a great success, both technically and as a public-relations exercise for both nations. The only serious problem was during reentry and [[splashdown]] of the Apollo craft, during which the crew were accidentally exposed to toxic [[hydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] fumes, caused by unignited [[reaction control system]] (RCS) [[hypergolic propellant]]s venting from the spacecraft and reentering a cabin air intake. The RCS was inadvertently left on during descent, and the toxic fumes were sucked into the spacecraft as it drew in outside air. Brand briefly lost consciousness, while Stafford retrieved emergency oxygen masks, put one on Brand, and gave one to Slayton. The three astronauts were hospitalized for two weeks in [[Honolulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ezell, Edward Clinton |author2=Ezell, Linda Neuman |year=1978 |title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project |journal=NASA History Series |issue=NASA Special Publication-4209 |publisher=NASA |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch11-9.htm |accessdate=2009-03-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823124845/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch11-9.htm|archivedate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand took responsibility for the mishap; because of high noise levels in the cabin during reentry, he believes he was unable to hear Stafford call off one item of the reentry checklist, the closure of two switches which would have automatically shut off the RCS and initiated drogue parachute deployment. These procedures were manually performed later than usual, allowing the ingestion of the propellant fumes through the ventilation system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RBgsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kMgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=apollo%20gas&amp;pg=993%2C1384026 "Brand Takes Blame For Apollo Gas Leak"], ''Florence, AL – Times Daily newspaper'', Aug. 10, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

The ASTP was the final flight of an Apollo spacecraft. Immediately after the launch of the Apollo spacecraft, preparations began to convert [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Pad 39B]] and the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] for use by the [[Space Shuttle]], the United States' next manned spacecraft program.  Launch Pad 39A had already been closed after the launch of [[Skylab]].

== Legacy ==

===Technical===
[[File:S74-24913.jpg|thumb|Apollo-Soyuz painting]]
A derivative (but mechanically incompatible) docking collar, [[APAS-89]] was launched as part of the [[Kristall]] module of the Soviet [[Mir]] space station.  Originally intended as the docking port for the (defunct) [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] Soviet space shuttle, the APAS-89 unit was used for the next Russian-American docking mission, [[STS-71]], twenty years later as part of the [[Shuttle–Mir Program]] (though not before the docking port was tested by the last APAS-equipped Soyuz, [[Soyuz TM-16|TM-16]], in 1993).

The American [[Space Shuttle]] continued to use the same APAS-89 docking hardware through the end of the [[Space Shuttle program]] to dock to Mir and then the [[International Space Station]], the latter through the [[Pressurized Mating Adapter]]s (PMAs).

The PMAs are equipped with the later [[APAS-95]] adapters, which differ from the APAS-89 adapters in that they are no longer androgynous; while compatible with the APAS-89 docking collars, they are not capable of acting as the "active" partner in docking.

The first PMA, PMA-1, remains in use as the interface connecting the Russian-built, NASA-owned [[Zarya]] module to the [[US Orbital Segment|US segment of the ISS]], and so the APAS continues in use to this day.

===Political===
The Apollo–Soyuz Test Project was the first joint US-Soviet space mission. At the time it was thought that space would become either more international or competitive as a result, however instead it became both. The mission became symbolic of each countries goals of scientific cooperation, while their individual news reports downplayed the technical prowess of the other. Soviet press implied that it was leading the US in space flight, tying it to [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideology, while the US reported that the Soyuz was technically primitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1985/8533/8533.PDF |pages=80–81 |publisher=US Congress, Office of Technology Assessment|title=U.S.-Soviet Cooperation in Space |date=July 1985 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-profile space cooperation declined after the successful mission and became entangled in [[Linkage (policy)|linkage politics]], however it set a precedent of cooperation that continued in the [[Shuttle–Mir Program]].&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/15/world/space-handshake-anniversary/index.html |title=How historic handshake in space brought superpowers closer |author=Kellie Morgan |publisher=CNN|date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=K_B_VvVp0SIC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=linkage+us+soviet+policy+space+program+apollo-soviet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CGGEt9EJ97&amp;sig=UoGXHvro1vKtwQJ47KwkMI25Bfs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkrZjMkdPbAhWFgrwKHRwTBf84ChDoAQheMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=linkage%20us%20soviet%20policy%20space%20program%20apollo-soviet&amp;f=false |author=James Moltz|title=The Politics of Space Security: Strategic Restraint and the Pursuit of National Interests|page=181 |publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-7858-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural===
The US and Soviet commanders, Stafford and Leonov became lasting friends. Leonov is the godfather of Stafford's younger children.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;&lt;ref name=ns&gt;{{cite web|publisher=New Scientist|title=Apollo–Soyuz: A cold war handshake in space, 40 years on |date=17 July 2015|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27910-apollosoyuz-a-cold-war-handshake-in-space-40-years-on/|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[minor planet]], [[2228 Soyuz-Apollo]], discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer [[Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh]], is named after the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schmadel | first = Lutz D. | title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names | page = 181 | edition = 5th |year = 2003 | publisher = Springer Verlag | location = New York | url = https://books.google.com/books?q=2222+Lermontov+ST1 | isbn = 3-540-00238-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spacecraft locations ==
The Apollo Command Module from the mission is on display at the [[California Science Center]] in Los Angeles. The descent module of Soyuz 19 is on display at the [[RKK Energiya museum]] in [[Korolyov, Moscow Oblast]], Russia.

A display at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington, D.C. shows the docked Apollo/Soyuz configuration with the restored Apollo Command and Service Module used for testing prior to the mission, the back-up Docking Module, and a model of the Soyuz spacecraft. An identical Soyuz model is exhibited at the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]]. A full-size mockup of the two docked spacecraft is located at the [[Cosmosphere]] in Hutchinson, Kansas.

=== Monument ===
In the wake of the mission, a large Apollo–Soyuz monument was constructed outside [[TsUP]] (the Soviet, later Russian space control center) in Moscow. It consisted of a metal Earth overarched by an arc terminating in a scale model of the joined Apollo–Soyuz spacecraft.  It was damaged when a vehicle collided with it in the late 1990s,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} and was removed for repairs.

=== Mission Control Centre===
The mission control room that hosted the Americans in [[Korolyov, Moscow Oblast|Korolyov, Russia]] was preserved in memorial of Apollo-Soyuz.&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;

The '''Association of Los Alamos Scientists''' (ALAS) was founded on 30 August 1945, by a group of scientists, who had worked on the development of the [[atomic bomb]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], a division of the [[Manhattan Project]]. 

==Purpose==
The purpose of the organization was "to promote the attainment and use of scientific and technological advances in the best interests of humanity", according to the [[manifesto]], available in the archives of the [[University of Chicago]].{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

The scientists believed that they, "by virtue of their special knowledge, have, in certain spheres, special political and social responsibilities beyond their obligations as individual citizens".{{Fact|date=March 2009}} The association sought to carry out these responsibilities by keeping its members informed, "and by providing a forum through which their views can be publicly and authoritatively expressed".{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

The ALAS concentrated its activities principally in promoting international control of [[nuclear power]] and directing it to peaceful uses. Its members also attempted to promote responsible uses of science, and the freedom and integrity of scientists and scientific research. 

The group sponsored public education on the nature and control of atomic energy through lectures, films, and exhibits, and the distribution of literature. It also attempted to influence public policy by means of informed statements to the press and correspondence with high government officials and congressmen.

The '''Canes II Group''' or '''Canes Venatici II Group''' (CVn II Group) is a [[group of galaxies]] about 26.1 million [[light-year]]s away from [[Earth]]. The group resides in the [[Local Supercluster]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerard de Vaucouleurs|G. De Vaucouleurs]], 1975. ''Nearby Groups of Galaxies'', ch. 5. the nearer groups within 10 megaparsecs. Published in "Galaxies and the Universe," ed. by A. Sandage, M. Sandage and J. Kristian&lt;/ref&gt; The largest [[galaxy]] within the cluster is [[Messier 106|M106]] (NGC 4258), which is a [[barred spiral galaxy]].&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galaxies in the Cluster==
Canes II is directly behind Canes I, which makes it difficult to show which galaxy belongs in which cluster.&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galgrps/cvnii.html|title=The Canes II Group|date=2003|publisher=Atlas of the Universe|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted that the following galaxies belong in Canes II;&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''canopy seed bank''' or '''aerial seed bank''' is the aggregate of viable [[seed]] stored by a [[plant]] in its [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]. Canopy seed banks occur in plants that postpone seed release for some reason.

It is often associated with [[serotiny]], the tendency of some plants to store seed in a [[Conifer cone|cone]] (e.g. in the genus ''[[Pinus]]'') or woody fruits (e.g. in the genus ''[[Banksia]]''), until seed release is triggered by the passage of a [[wildfire]].

It also occurs in plants that colonise areas of shifting sands such as sand dunes. In such cases, the seed is held in the canopy even if the canopy becomes buried; thus the seed is anchored in place until good germination conditions occur.

A '''cascading discontinuity set''' is a term related to [[Wild card (foresight)|Wild Cards]] and applied in [[foresight (management)|foresight]] and risk management areas.  It attempts to define a series of smaller, seemingly disconnected events that merge over time leading to a Wild Card-like result.

'''Chaotic rotation''' involves the irregular and unpredictable [[rotation]] of an astronomical body. Unlike [[Earth's rotation]], a chaotic rotation may not have a fixed axis or period. Because of the [[conservation of angular momentum]], chaotic rotation is not seen in objects that are [[spherically symmetric]] or well isolated from gravitational interaction, but is the result of the interactions within a system of orbiting bodies, similar to those associated with [[orbital resonance]].

Examples of chaotic rotation include [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]],&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1840">'''Coherent information''' is an [[entropy measure]] used in [[quantum information theory]].  It is a property of a [[quantum state]] ρ and a [[quantum channel]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;; intuitively, it attempts to describe how much of the [[quantum information]] in the state will remain after the state goes through the channel.  In this sense, it is intuitively similar to the [[mutual information]] of [[classical information theory]]. The coherent information is written &lt;math&gt;I(\rho, \mathcal{N})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==
The coherent information is defined as &lt;math&gt;I(\rho, \mathcal{N})\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ S(\mathcal{N} \rho) - S(\mathcal{N},\rho)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; S(\mathcal{N} \rho)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[quantum statistical mechanics#Von Neumann entropy|von Neumann entropy]] of the output and &lt;math&gt;S({\mathcal N},\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[entropy exchange]] between the state and the channel.

==History==
The coherent information was introduced by [[Benjamin Schumacher]] and [[Michael A. Nielsen]] in a 1996 paper ''Quantum data processing and error correction'', which appeared in [[Physical Review A]].

The '''Council for Scientific and Industrial Research''' (CSIR) is [[South Africa]]'s central and premier scientific research and development organisation. It was established by an act of [[Parliament of South Africa|parliament]] in 1945 and is situated on its own campus in the city of [[Pretoria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csir.co.za/profile_of_csir.html Profile of the CSIR] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120724121225/http://www.csir.co.za/profile_of_csir.html |date=24 July 2012 }}. Retrieved 6 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest research and development (R&amp;D) organisation in Africa and accounts for about 10% of the entire African R&amp;D budget. It has a staff of approximately 3,000 technical and scientific researchers, often working in multi-disciplinary teams.

==CSIR contract research and development==

===Overview===
The CSIR contract R&amp;D portfolio aims to enable clear understanding of national imperatives and the needs of industry to optimise the impact of the CSIR's R&amp;D outputs. It leverages public, private and international partnerships in support of cutting-edge science, engineering and technology (SET).The organisation has clients in both the private sector (micro, small, medium and large enterprises; formal and informal), as well as in the public sector (national, provincial and local government). The organisation also deals with public enterprises and institutions, national safety and security establishments, and development structures. Regionally and abroad, the CSIR fosters partnerships and a network of clients and partner organisations as part of a global sphere of influence on matters of technology. The CSIR liaises closely with tertiary education institutions. With a strong emphasis on relevant and developmental work, it also has strong roots in various communities, and collaborates with a wide range of donors and funding agencies.The CSIR aims to contribute to the national programme of development, perform relevant knowledge generating research and transferring technology and skilled human capital, and strengthen the science and technology base. The Frascati Manual defines R&amp;D as creative work undertaken systematically to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humanity, culture and society, and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications. At the CSIR, the research, development and innovation (RDI) chain encompasses, what we term, types A, B and C research: 
*Type A refers to directed basic or applied research that explores the underlying nature of a system 
*Type B talks to experimental development that typically results in a new prototype, which captures new knowledge into a product, service or policy 
*Type C is technology transfer, the first step of knowledge application. 
The CSIR operates with two kinds of R&amp;D income, each with its own purpose. The Parliamentary Grant is used for strengthening the CSIR’s S&amp;T base - knowledge, people and infrastructure. Secondly, Contract R&amp;D income is derived from performing contract research for clients in the public and private sectors, locally and abroad, on specific programmes, initiatives and projects. All R&amp;D work contributes to the [[National System of Innovation]] (NSI).

==Controversy==
In July 2016 the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism published an article that alleges that South Africa's Science and Technology Minister [[Naledi Pandor]] and Director-General [[Phil Mjwara]] were attempting to put undue pressure the CSIR, at the behest of ANC treasurer-general [[Zweli Mkhize]], to favour the Chinese multinational [[Huawei Technologies]] in the purchase of a new R116-million (equivalent to around US$8 million) super computer for the institute.  This followed the publication of the Council's long time CEO, Sibusiso Sibisi's, open letter of resignation stating that irregularities and political pressure on the awarding of contracts to suppliers was of great concern.&lt;ref name="Super Computer Controversy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-07-01-amabhungane-csirs-supercomputer-tender-and-the-theatre-of-the-absurd-that-followed-it/#.V3lz0tJ96W9 | title=amaBhungane: CSIR’s supercomputer tender and the theatre of the absurd that followed it | publisher=[[Daily Maverick]] | date=1 July 2016 | accessdate=3 July 2016 | author=amaBhungane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dasymeter''' was meant initially as a device to demonstrate the buoyant effect of gases like air; as shown in the adjacent pictures.  A '''dasymeter''' which allows weighing acts as a [[densimeter]] used to measure the [[density]] of [[gas]]es.

==Principle==
The [[Archimedes' Principle|Principle of Archimedes]] permits to derive a formula which does not rely on any information of volume:
A sample, the big sphere in the adjacent images, of known mass-density is weighed in vacuum and then immersed into the gas and weighed again. 
From the known mass density of the sample (sphere) and its two weight-values can be calculated the mass-density of the gas:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac { \text{density of sphere}} { \text {density of gas} } = \frac { \text{weight of sphere}} { \text{weight of sphere} - \text{weight of immersed sphere}}\,&lt;/math&gt;
(The formula was taken from the article [[buoyancy]] and still has to be solved for the density of the gas.)

==Construction and use==
It consists of a thin [[sphere]] made of [[glass]], ideally with an average density close to that of the gas to be investigated.  This sphere is immersed in the gas and [[weight|weighed]].

==History of the dasymeter==
The dasymeter was invented in 1650 by [[Otto von Guericke]].  [[Archimedes]] used a pair of scales which he immersed into water to demonstrate the buoyant effect of water.  A dasymeter can be seen as a variant of that pair of scales, only immersed into gas.

'''''Dude, What Would Happen''''' is an American live-action [[reality series]] that aired on [[Cartoon Network]] originally as part of its CN Real block which aired a line of live-action reality shows promoted in the summer season of 2009. The show premiered on August 19, 2009, preceded by another CN Real series ''[[Bobb'e Says]]''. The show is hosted by three male teenagers (C.J. Manigo, [[Jackson Rogow]], and Ali Sepasyar) who wondered what would happen if some wild event, scheme or experiment were to occur. The three teens attempt to create the event themselves and consult experts ("The Lab Dudes") when needed.

The series went on to have four seasons aired throughout a span of two years, in which the series eventually ended in September 2011, as the series was not announced for a renewal by Cartoon Network.

''Dude, What Would Happen'' was one of only two CN Real shows (the other being ''[[Destroy Build Destroy]]'') to have been renewed for additional seasons, as the other CN Real shows had already been cancelled earlier most likely due to low ratings.

==Production==
In the "Dudes Make It Happen" weekend special, it was revealed that new episodes were coming. These episodes ranked #1 in their timeslot among boys  6-11 on all television.&lt;ref name=tvbythenumbers.com&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Robert|title=Cartoon Network Led By "Destroy Build Destroy," "Dude, What Would Happen" and "Johnny Test"|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/03/02/cartoon-network-led-by-destroy-build-destroy-dude-what-would-happen-and-johnny-test/43580/|work=TVbytheNumbers|publisher=Zap2it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was listed as returning for Cartoon Network's 2010–2011 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorman|first=Bill|title=Cartoon Network Unveils New Line Up And Returning Shows|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/04/21/cartoon-network-unveils-new-line-up-and-returning-shows-of-shows/49302/|work=TVbytheNumbers|publisher=Zap2it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next season began airing on October 6, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/09/21/international-sensation-hole-in-the-wall-joins-cartoon-networks-explosive-wednesday-night-line-up-on-october-6/20100921cartoon01|title=International Sensation Hole in the Wall Joins Cartoon Network's Explosive Wednesday Night Line-Up on October 6|publisher=TheFutonCritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Vincent Cariati renewed his contract to serve an additional four seasons as the series' showrunner, co-creator and co-executive producer. The show had four seasons aired, but was not announced as a returning series, automatically cancelling the series altogether.

'''ESO 510-G13''' is a [[spiral galaxy]] approximately [[1 E24 m|150 million]] [[light-year]]s away in the [[constellation]] [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]]. The equatorial dust cloud is heavily warped; this may indicate that ESO 510-G13 has [[interacting galaxy|interacted with another galaxy]]. If this is the case, it would provide an excellent illustration of the distortion caused by interacting galaxies, discussed in the article [[Galaxy formation and evolution]] under the ''Spiral galaxy'' heading.

This galaxy was examined by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in 2001.

'''Faculty of 1000''' (abbreviated '''F1000''') is a publisher of services for [[life scientist]]s and [[clinical researchers]].

== Services ==

===F1000Prime===

'''''F1000Prime''''' publishes recommendations of articles in [[biology]] and [[medicine]] from a "faculty" of around 6,000 scientists and clinical researchers and 5,000 more junior "associate" faculty. The service covers 32 disciplines and around 3,700 journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last                  =Wets | first                 =Kathleen | last2                 =Weedon | first2                =Dave| last3                 =Velterop | first3                =Jan | date                  =1 October 2003 | title                 =Post-publication filtering and evaluation: Faculty of 1000| url                   =http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/alpsp/lp/2003/00000016/00000004/art00002 | journal               =Learned Publishing | publisher             =ALPSP | volume                =16 | issue                 =4 | pages                 =249–258 | doi                   =10.1087/095315103322421982 | name-list-format      = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; It previously existed as two sister sites, ''F1000 Biology'', launched in 2002, and ''F1000 Medicine'', launched in 2006. In 2010, these services were combined as ''F1000.com''.

== History ==
Faculty of 1000 was founded in 2000 by publishing entrepreneur [[Vitek Tracz]], a scientific publishing pioneer and founder of the BioMed Central and Current Opinions journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.342.6154.66 |title=The Seer of Science Publishing |year=2013 |last1=Rabesandratana |first1=T. |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=342 |issue=6154 |pages=66–7 |pmid=24092726}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is part of the Science Navigation Group, which also owns [[Web of Stories]].

In March 2015, Tracz was featured in an article in Library Journal, titled "F1000’s Vitek Tracz: Redefining Scientific Communication",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Henrietta Verma |title=	
F1000’s Vitek Tracz: Redefining Scientific Communication |url=http://reviews.libraryjournal.com/2015/03/reference/f1000s-vitek-tracz-redefining-scientific-communication/ |journal=Library Journal |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; discussing the problems with peer review and why he thinks it is "mortally sick".

Tracz also published an editorial piece in ''F1000Research'' in May 2015 about the "five deadly sins of science publishing", detailing the problems with the process of preparing and publishing research findings, and judging their veracity and significance. He explains how F1000 is starting to tackle these ‘deadly sins’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last =Tracz |first =Vitek |date =11 May 2015 |title =The five deadly sins of science publishing [v1; ref status: not peer reviewed, f1000r.es/5de]|url =http://f1000research.com/articles/4-112/v1 |journal =F1000Research  |doi =10.12688/f1000research.6488.1 |name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, F1000 launched Open Research Central, a "central portal for open research publishing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openresearchcentral.org/|title=Open Research Central|website=openresearchcentral.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.f1000.com/2017/07/12/orc-open-research-central-repulsive-and-malevolent-or-lover-of-rebellion-and-freedom/|title=ORC  – Open Research Central: ‘repulsive and malevolent’ or ‘lover of rebellion and freedom’ {{!}} F1000 Blogs|website=blog.f1000.com|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model has been running on [https://f1000research.com/ F1000Research] since 2013 and current partners include [[Wellcome Trust]]'s Wellcome Open Research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/|title=Wellcome Open Research|website=wellcomeopenresearch.org|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]]'s Gates Open Research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gatesopenresearch.org/|title=Gates Open Research provides all Gates researchers with a place to rapidly publish any results they think are worth sharing.|website=gatesopenresearch.org|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[University College London]]'s, UCL Child Health Open Research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://childhealthopenresearch.org.uk/|title=UCL Child Health Open Research|website=childhealthopenresearch.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more to come in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openresearchcentral.org/about|title=How it Works - Open Research Central|website=openresearchcentral.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MNI Open Research platform was launched in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.f1000.com/2017/08/30/montreal-neuroscience-institute-and-hospital/|title=You just can’t do it alone {{!}} F1000 Blogs|website=blog.f1000.com|access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4366">'''Ginsberg's theorem''' is a [[parody]] of the [[laws of thermodynamics]] in terms of a person playing a game. The quote was first attributed to the poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] in a 1975 issue of the ''[[Coevolution Quarterly]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
  | date    = 1975

  | page    = 135
  | doi     = 
  | pmid    = |access-date=
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the quote originates as a slight misstatement of the opening lines of "[[You Can't Win (song)|You Can't Win]]," by [[Charlie Smalls]], as the copyright date for Small's song is 1974, earlier than the first attribution to Ginsberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the song was cut from 1975 Broadway debut of the Wiz, it was performed at the original, 1974, Baltimore run of the musical.

(Although [[electromagnetism]] is a long-range force, [[Electric charge|charge]] neutrality demands that its influence is unimportant on large scales.) The basic picture is as follows.

Suppose that at some initial time, say [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], there are small irregularities in the distribution of matter. Those regions with more matter will exert a greater [[gravitational force]] on their neighboring regions, and hence tend to draw in the surrounding material. This extra material makes them even more dense than before, increasing their gravitational attraction and further enhancing their pull on their neighbors. An irregular distribution of matter is therefore unstable under the influence of gravity, becoming more and more irregular as time goes by.

This instability is exactly what is needed to explain the observation that the Universe is much more irregular now than at decoupling, and gravitational instability is almost universally accepted to be the primary influence leading to the formation of structures in the Universe. It is an appealingly simple picture, rather spoiled in real life by the fact that while gravity may have the lead role, numerous other processes also have a part to play and things become quite complicated. For example, we know that radiation has [[pressure]] proportional to its [[density]], and during [[structure formation]] the irregularities create pressure gradients which lead to forces opposing the [[gravitational collapse]]. We know that neutrinos move relativistically and do not interact with other material, and so they are able to escape from structures as they form. And once structure formation begins, the complex [[astrophysics]] of stars, especially [[supernova]]e, can inject [[energy]] back into the [[intergalactic region]]s and influence regions yet to complete their gravitational collapse.&lt;ref name="liddle"&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Liddle |title=An Introduction to Modern Cosmology |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley |date=2003 |isbn=0-470-84835-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heightened Senses''' is an online story written by Sharat Chinnapa. It was started on May 6, 2012. It is a [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian]] and borderline science fiction story set approximately 30 years into the future. The story is updated every Tuesday and Saturday.

In this alternate future, genetic experimentation has caused an infectious genetic mutation known as "Gene-X" to run rampant.

==Gene-X mutations==
A Gene-X mutation, caused by the virus ''Hithalmia Azitas'', is a highly infectious condition that causes the afflicted to react to a single certain "trigger".
The reaction to this trigger often results in a heightening of the senses of the afflicted - a condition known as a "Heightening".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match000.html Match 0 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the main characters in Heightened Senses are infected, and have Heightenings.

==Setting and backstory==
Gene-X went viral thirty years ago and the world went out of control. There were massacres of infected people and those who wanted to escape the infection built settlements called "Stations" that were completely cut off from the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match000.html Match 0 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;
The population of the world dropped drastically and people regressed to a life with very limited resources. Outside the Stations, people grouped together under powerful leaders in order to survive. And an organisation called the Country was formed. The origins of the Country are uncertain, but they are the primary organisation that battles the Stations in the vicinity of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match008.html Match 8 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The plot begins in a city now called Haven. The old name of the city is forgotten. The primarily follows two characters, Lance and Reide. They are fighters for hire in the city of Haven, where they accept jobs for payment in cash or kind to keep themselves supplied. An informant, Terrai Hanswitch, approaches them with a case regarding a missing child&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match002.html Match 2 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt; - and they accept.
The case leads them to the doorstep of the one who is effectively rules the city, Shadow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match005.html Match 5 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;
Shadow has, in fact, constructed this case to bring Lance and Reide to him - and make them an offer. A third party, Erin Iyelsviel - the Ace of Diamonds (see rankings in the Country) - joins their meeting, and things turn hostile. Eventually, Shadow makes his proposition, after Erin leaves. He wants the pair to infiltrate the Country and bring back information regarding research the Country is doing on multiple Heightenings. He reveals that this boy he has kidnapped, Jared - the one Lance and Reide are supposed to recover - is an example of a person with two Heightenings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match008.html Match 0 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lance and Reide decide to accept the offer - despite the danger involved in dealing with the Country. They return to their base of operations and are met by the Jack of Clubs, Jay, who identifies herself as a double agent who is reporting to Shadow from the Country. They leave with her to the Country's base and are welcomed into the House of Clubs. Inside, Reide is taken to meet the King of Clubs, Cloud - while Lance is dismissed to a room upstairs. Inside, he is met by the Queen of Clubs, Eleanor. Cloud offers to teach Reide to "transcend" on the condition that he joins the Country,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match013.html Match 13 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt; and Reide accepts. Meanwhile Eleanor makes a similar proposition to Lance - she suggests that since they have very similar abilities, they might be able to learn each other's - proving that Heightenings are not as limited as they are believed to be, he accepts as well and they begin "practice" immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match017.html Match 17 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrai Hanswitch attempts to sneak into the Spire - Shadow's stronghold - and spy on a meeting between the top executives in Shadows organisation. She manages to get in, but is caught. However, Jared pleads for her life and Shadow decides not to kill her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match017.html Match 17 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, both Jared and Terrai are sent on a mission to a Station identified as Station "Aris".

The next day, Lance is accosted by some members of the House of Clubs and is forced to defend himself. The fight is interrupted by Jay, the Jack, who declares that Lance be put in solitary confinement (for a week) for his actions. She escorts him out, and explains that this is a ruse to give him greater freedom of movement in the Country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match018.html Match 18 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt; His task is now to infiltrate the other Houses (of Spades, Diamonds, and Hearts) in turn and fulfill Shadow's assignment. Meanwhile, Reide begins his training with Cloud - and is kept apart from Lance. He believes his friend to be in solitary confinement.

Jay leaves Lance at the house of Spades where over a few days he befriends the Three of Spades, Flair,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match022.html Match 22 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt; and steals one of her access cards. With these he is granted access to the computers and he finds information he believes Shadow might be interested in - and transfers it onto a drive that Jay gave him. He then leaves the House of Spades and goes to the House of Diamonds. 

Six days into his week of solitary confinement, Lance incapacitates the Four of Diamonds and takes his access card - attempting to use the same trick he used at Spades. But while attempting to steal data from the House of Diamonds, he sets of an alarm. Before he can escape, he is confronted again by Erin Iylesviel and captured - but during the battle, he catches a glimpse of Jay leaving the facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match030.html Match 30 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Station Aris, an order is given for people to be sent out of the Station to capture "specimens" from the outside to test the effectiveness of a drug that the Stations have developed to Counter Gene-X.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match027.html Match 27 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Country, a meeting of the royalty is called - and Cloud finds that Eleanor has disappeared. He takes Reide along instead. At the meeting, the possibility of the Stations mobilizing again is discussed. And at the end, Erin Iyelsviel announces that an intruder was caught in Diamonds - Lance. The punishment decided for him is death.
Meanwhile, Eleanor breaks into the House of Diamonds and rescues Lance and they attempt to escape the facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match033.html Match 33 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;
(Plot has gone this far as of Match 33–30 August)

==The Country==
The Country is an organisation formed approximately 30 years prior to the start of the story. Their primary objective is to combat the Stations - and prevent them from massacring people from the Outside as was done 30 years ago. The Country is divided into four Houses - the House of Spades, Hearts, Diamonds and Clubs. The Country is composed of "members" and "card holders" - the former are mostly soldiers or scientists.

===Card Holders===

The Country's equivalent of an "officer" is a card holder. They rank Two through Ace and increase in seniority and power from Two through Jack. The King and Queen seem to have an approximately equal relationship as decisions are taken by both parties. (Note: There is no indication that the King and Queen are married - it's just a rank) Very little is known, at this point, about the Aces. The Ace of Diamonds seems to be a somewhat autonomous entity but has never taken a decision that affected the entire House.

==Types of Heightenings==
Commonly, there are three distinct types of Heightenings, Transformative, Amplificatory, and Hypnotic. There is also mention of a fourth type, the Transcendental Heightening.
* '''Transformative''' — Heightenings involve the users body being physically modified.
* '''Amplificatory''' — Heightenings cause a certain sense or ability of a normal person to be dramatically increased.
* '''Hypnotic''' — Heightenings involve some kind of hypnosis - where the user can influence the mind of another person, or in some cases himself.
* '''Transcendental''' — Heightenings, are of two types. First, where it is ''innate'' - the person is born with this, and it involves the ability to affect the physical world with the mind. The second is the ''acquired'' type - where a normal Heightening is improved so much that it results in an almost godlike ability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/posts/match013.html Match 13 Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==

===Lance Kelyrta===

Also known as: The Ignitor&lt;br /&gt;
Age: 19&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 172&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;
Trigger: Proximity to fire.&lt;br /&gt;
Heightening: (Hypnotic) The ability to transfer select thoughts with a person for as long as he is near the fire.

Background: Lance grew up in a small town many miles from the city of Haven. He was an only child. The town was closely knit - as such places are - but supplies are scarce. The only have what they can produce themselves. Lance (and Reide) both left to seek their futures elsewhere - three years before the start of the story. They still occasionally return and leave some of their profits behind.

Lance has a very high tolerance of pain. He sometimes practices his heightening on himself. However, despite his famous reputation as the demonic Ignitor, he only kills when he is forced to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/bios/Lance.html Lance - Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reide===

Last name is currently unknown. &lt;br /&gt;
Also known as: The Viper&lt;br /&gt;
Age: 23&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 180&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;
Trigger: Repetition of a sequence of notes. (exact notes will be added)&lt;br /&gt;
Heightening: (Amplificatory) Dramatically heightened brain assimilation. Results in faster judgement and reaction time. Average (heightened) reaction time: 0.06 seconds.

Background: Reide and Lance come from the same town, and have known each other almost all their lives. Reide is practical and situation oriented. It was his idea to leave the village and work for hire in Haven, in order to be less of a burden to the town that was his home. He proposed the idea to Lance, who agreed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/bios/Reide.html Reide - Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrai Hanswitch===

Age: 22&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 167&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;
Trigger: Skin contact with iron. (exact notes will be added)&lt;br /&gt;
Heightening: (Amplificatory) The ability to repel attention. Implies that people are highly likely to not notice her presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/bios/Terrai.html Terrai - Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shadow===

Age: 15&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 172&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;
Trigger: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;
Heightening: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;
Background: Very little is actually known about the one called Shadow. He rose to prominence in haven four years before the start of the story, when he was merely an eleven-year-old boy. He was quickly surrounded by strong people, who often acted on his behalf. Slowly, his power began to consolidate in the unnamed gang, that is known only as 'Shadow's folk'. He has a reputation for not being seen - or leaving dead those he has encountered, perhaps this is the reason for his name. The truth of his heightening and trigger is obscure, because most who have seen it are dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/bios/Shadow.html Shadow - Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erin Iylesviel===

Also known as: The Ace of Diamonds &lt;br /&gt;
Age: 22&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 167&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;
Trigger: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;
Heightening: It is likely to be the production of electricity in his body. &lt;br /&gt;
Background: Erin is a powerful member of the Country. In the organisation, he is something of a lone wolf, with his own agenda. He seems to have a good intelligence network, as he often comes to know of things quickly, but this network has never been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/bios/Erin.html Erin - Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jay===

Also known as: The Jack of Clubs &lt;br /&gt;
Age: 25&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 156&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;
Trigger: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;
Heightening: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;
Background: Jay is the Jack of Clubs - she plays the dangerous role of Shadow's contact in the Country and she cannot afford to be found out. She brings Lance and Reide to the Country as Shadow's agents - but there are other reasons too...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/bios/Jay.html Jay - Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloud===

Also known as: The King of Clubs&lt;br /&gt;
Age: 27&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 183&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;
Trigger: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;
Heightening: Telekinesis&lt;br /&gt;
Background: The awe inspiring and charismatic King of Clubs is the youngest of the four Kings. It is said that he has never even been touched in a battle. He joined the Country as a Jack - the first and only person to ever be made a senior member upon joining. When the previous King was killed in the raids by Stations eight years ago Cloud took his place not only by the old king's command, but along with a unanimous vote in his favour. All of the Clubs are fervently loyal and will do anything he says - except, perhaps, one person?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/bios/Cloud.html Cloud - Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eleanor===

Also known as: The Queen of Clubs&lt;br /&gt;
Age: 26&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 170&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;
Trigger: Absence of sunlight&lt;br /&gt;
Heightening: The ability to transfer thoughts from another person to herself. &lt;br /&gt;
Background: Eleanor was the Country's youngest member - both her parents were of the Country so she was born and raised within it. With both of them among the dead in the Station's raids eight years ago she was left alone and rose quickly up the ranks. While her ability is not an offensive one, she is able to use it to predict a person's movements making exceedingly difficult to match in combat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/bios/Eleanor.html Eleanor - Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ray Steele===

Age: 41&lt;br /&gt;
Height: 179&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;
Trigger: none &lt;br /&gt;
Heightening: none &lt;br /&gt;
Background: Ray Steele was eleven years old when he became part of Station Aris - just as the conflict was beginning. His father was a rich businessman who died when Steele was in his late twenties. That year, Steele joined the Aris defence force. He was a late entrant, but rose up the ranks quickly. In his early thirties he played a vital role in the most crippling strike the Stations ever made on the Country. Acclaimed for his strategic improvisations in that battle, eight years prior to today, he became a candidate for the post of the Captain of the Aris Defence Force. He finally rose to this position when he was 35 and has led the Force competently since then. He is also an excellent shot with a variety of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heightenedsensesstory.com/bios/Razor.html Steele - Heightened Senses]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft''''' (2011) is the ''[[New York Times]]'' bestselling memoir by [[Microsoft]] cofounder [[Paul Allen]]. Published in 2011 by Portfolio, a [[Penguin Group]] imprint, the book recounts how Allen became enamored with computers at an early age, conceived the idea for Microsoft, recruited his friend [[Bill Gates]] to join him, and launched what would become the world’s most successful software company.

The book, reveals the often conflicted partnership between Allen and Gates, and how — when Allen was recovering from cancer — Gates unsuccessfully conspired to dilute Allen’s 36 percent share of Microsoft. ''Idea Man'' also explores Allen's business and creative ventures following his 1983 departure from Microsoft, including his involvement in [[SpaceShipOne]], his purchase of the [[Portland Trailblazers]] and [[Seattle Seahawks]], his passion for music, and his ongoing support for scientific research.

Described by critics as candid, profound and incendiary, ''Idea Man'' is a true story of ambition and ideas made real.

==Reviews==
''[[The Guardian]]'': “There's an important lesson here that has subsequently been airbrushed out of the Microsoft legend: Allen's contributions to the partnership were as critical as Gates's. Without the tools that he developed, and his insight into the infrastructure that software development requires, Microsoft's subsequent growth would have been impossible.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Naughton|first1=John|title=Idea Man: A Memoir by the Co-founder of Microsoft by Paul Allen – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/08/paul-allen-idea-man-review|website=The Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of all [[sovereign state]]s and [[dependent territory|dependencies]] by [[total fertility rate]] (TFR): the expected number of children born per woman in her child-bearing years.

== Methodology ==
The [[World Bank]] ranking list is based on the data for the year 2016 published online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?year_high_desc=true|title=Fertility rate, total (births per woman) - Data|author=|date=|website=data.worldbank.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank is a [[United Nations]] [[international financial institution]], a component of the [[World Bank Group]], and a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]], but it also collects and analyses information on demography issues based on international and national sources: (1) United Nations Population Division. World Population Prospects, (2) United Nations Statistical Division. Population and Vital Statistics Report (various years), (3) Census reports and other statistical publications from national statistical offices, (4) Eurostat: Demographic Statistics, (5) Secretariat of the Pacific Community: Statistics and Demography Programme, and (6) U.S. Census Bureau: International Database.

The [[Population Reference Bureau]] (PRB) ranking list is based on the data of the ''2018 World Population Data Sheet&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prb.org/2018-world-population-data-sheet-with-focus-on-changing-age-structures/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018_WPDS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;'' published online.

This is a collection of lists of mammal species by the estimated global population, divided by [[mammal classification|orders]]. (Lists only exist for some orders; e.g. the most diverse order - [[rodent]]s - is missing.) Much of the data in these lists were created by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]]'s Global Mammal Assessment Team, which consists of 1700 [[mammalogy|mammalogists]] from over 130 countries. They recognize 5488 species in the class.&lt;ref name="IUCN Mammals intro"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iucnredlist.org/initiatives/mammals |title= Initiatives:Mammals |accessdate= 2012-11-21 |author= IUCN |date= n.d. |work= IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2012.2 |publisher= [[IUCN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IUCN Mammals acknowledgements"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iucnredlist.org/initiatives/mammals/acknowledgements |title= Initiatives:Mammals:Acknowledgements |accessdate= 2012-11-21 |author= IUCN |date= n.d. |work= IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2012.2 |publisher= [[IUCN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These lists are not comprehensive, as not all mammals have had their numbers estimated. For example, a live specimen of the [[spade-toothed whale]] was first observed in December 2010, and the event only recognized as such in November 2012; no estimate yet exists for the global population.&lt;ref name="Thompson et al"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=Kirsten |author2=C.

It is estimated that the total number of wild mammals in the world is about 130 [[1,000,000,000|billion]].&lt;ref&gt;http://reducing-suffering.org/how-many-wild-animals-are-there/&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Mario Hamuy''' is a [[Astronomy in Chile|Chilean Astronomer]] and Professor of Astronomy at the [[University of Chile]] and Cerro Calan Observatory. He is well known for his observational work on all classes of supernovae, especially the use of Type Ia and Type II supernovae as measures of cosmic distance. He was a student in astronomy and physics at the [[University of Chile]] working with Jorge Melnick. In February 1987, he came to the [[Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory]] and within a few days of his arrival when the [[Type II supernova]] [[SN1987A]] exploded in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], he began a major campaign at CTIO to monitor this important supernova.&lt;ref&gt;Hamuy et al. 1988, ''Astronomical Journal'', 95, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, in collaboration with Jose Maza, [[Mark M. Phillips]], and [[Nicholas Suntzeff]], he began the [[Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey]] which led to the pioneering work on the standard candle luminosities of [[Type Ia supernovae]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, M. M. 1993, ''Astrophysical Journal Letters"'',413, 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamuy, M. et al. 1993, ''Astronomical Journal'', 106, 2392&lt;/ref&gt; This work led to the precise measurements of the [[Hubble Constant]] H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suntzeff, N.B. et al. 1999, ''Astronomical Journal'', 119, 1175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, W. et al. 2001, ''Astrophysical Journal'', 553, 47&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[deceleration parameter]] q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Riess, A. et al. 1998, ''Astronomical Journal'', 119, 1009; Schmidt, B. P., et al.  1998, ''Astrophysical Journal'', 507, 46; see also Perlmutter, S. et al. 1999, ''Astrophysical Journal'', 517, 565&lt;/ref&gt; the latter indicating the presence of a [[dark energy]] or [[cosmological constant]] dominating the mass/energy of the [[Universe]].

In graduate school at the [[University of Arizona]] at the [[Steward Observatory]] working with Professor Phil Pinto, he changed his focus to the study of core collapse supernovae, in particular using [[Type II supernova]]e to measure geometric distances using the [[Walter Baade|Baade]]-[[Adriaan Jan Wesselink|Wesselink]] method, also called the expanding-photosphere method (EPM).&lt;ref&gt;Hamuy, M., et al. 2001,

The '''Martin Marietta Spacemaster''' was a proposed configuration for what became the [[Space Shuttle]], which featured an [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24]]-derived orbiter, and an unusual "[[catamaran]] style" booster stage. During launch and ascent, the orbiter would be located in a recess in the booster. The booster's 14 engines would be located in clusters of seven, at the bottom of both halves of the booster. Unlike the final design for the Space Shuttle, the Spacemaster would lack an external tank, and the boosters would be joined, by means of connecting struts which would also serve as the mounting for the orbiter.

The concept was evaluated in 1967, but was rejected. [[Martin Marietta]] went on to produce the [[Space Shuttle external tank]] (ET) for the final STS Space Shuttle design (by [[Lockheed Martin]] after a merger with [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]).

A model of the Martin Marietta Spacemaster is in the collection of the [[Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/model-space-shuttle-martin-marietta-spacemaster-two-stage-concept-196|title=Model, Space Shuttle, Martin Marietta Spacemaster Two-Stage Concept, 1:96|work=National Air and Space Museum|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mass media]] influences spatial [[perception]] through journalistic [[cartography]] and spatial [[bias]] in news coverage.

"[[Journalism]] is one of the few industries that provide the [[general public]] the most of its [[information]] about places and [[geography]],",&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier, M.,(1989). Maps with the news. Chicago: The university Chicago Press, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; mass media is one of the significant factors in shaping perception of places.&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;Lewis, L., Degani, A., Hudson., (1980). The measurement and explanation of the spatial perception of Africa: a Nigerian viewpoint. [[Geografiska Annaler]], 62B, 33-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gribok, M. V., (2008). Cartographic representation of mass media influence on the formation of the image of Russian regions. Vestnik Moskovskogo Universiteta, 5 (4), 41-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, mass media has been criticized for "limited [[iconography]] that constructs the newscape-generic locations that are interchangeable from story to story, and which have come to give a restrictive and distorted worldview".&lt;ref&gt;Huxford, J., (2007). The proximity paradox: Live reporting, virtual proximity and the concept of place in the news. Journalism. 8, p.670.&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of geographical balance in news coverage may lead to limitations of spatial knowledge, i.e., US media focuses on a limited number of nations and regions for international news coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Golan, G., &amp; Wanta, W., (2003). International elections on the U.S. network news: An examination of factors affecting newsworthiness. Gazette,. 65, 25-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

When some news has an important geographic component, [[journalism]] concerns with a location of journalistic information.&lt;ref name="Monmonier, M. 1989"&gt;Monmonier, M., (1989). Maps with the news. Chicago: The university of Chicago press.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of maps becomes appropriate as "a map is an efficient means for showing location and describing geographic relationships".&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier, M., (1989). Maps with the news. Chicago: The university of Chicago press, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media may use maps to show an event that have spatially distributed data like election results, the distribution of [[acid rain]], radon contamination, weather forecast, traffic, or traveling routes; also describe a story of a battle, a geopolitical strategy, or an environmental threat.&lt;ref name="Monmonier, M. 1989"/&gt; Geographers criticize journalistic cartography for deficiencies and constraints of map production.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmartin, P., (1985). The design of journalistic maps/purposes, parameters and prospects. Cartographica: The international journal for geographic information and geovisualization, 22, 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Green, D. R. 1999"&gt;Green, D. R., (1999). Journalistic cartography: good or bad? A debate point. The cartographic journal, 36, 141-153.&lt;/ref&gt; Maps in journalism are produced by graphic artists, who lack in cartographic training.&lt;ref name="Green, D. R. 1999"/&gt; 

Geographers have explored the spatial bias in news reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, A., (1991). Making the news: spatial and non-spatial biases in British parliamentary reports of the Rowntree - Mackintosh takeover. [[Geografiska Annaler]], 73B, 95-109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walmsley, D. J., (1980). Spatial bias in Australian news reporting. [[Australian Geographer]], 14, 342-349.&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial pattern of news is created by journalistic norms, which concern is national coverage, national interest, geographic stereotypes and accessibility to news events.&lt;ref name="Brooker-Gross, S. 1983"&gt;Brooker-Gross, S., (1983). Spatial aspects of newsworthiness. [[Geografiska Annaler]], 65B, 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; As mass media provides live reporting from the scenes of the news events, journalism requires spatial proximity, event proximity, and [[broadcast]] proximity.&lt;ref&gt;Huxford, J., (2007). The proximity paradox: Live reporting, virtual proximity and the concept of place in the news. Journalism. 8, 657-674.&lt;/ref&gt; Capitals, major financial centers and politically unstable places are highly geographically stereotyped and considered as newsworthy locations where important events happen often &lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooker-Gross, S. 1983"/&gt; Economic ties and [[social distance]] play also significant role in news coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Bendix, J., &amp; Liebler, C.

In [[hematology]], '''myelopoiesis''' in the broadest [[word sense|sense]] of the term is the production of [[bone marrow]] and of all [[cell (biology)|cells]] that arise from it, namely, all [[blood cell]]s. But in a narrower sense that is also commonly used, myelopoiesis is the regulated formation specifically of [[myeloid]] leukocytes ([[myelocyte]]s), including [[eosinophilic|eosinophilic granulocytes]], [[basophilic|basophilic granulocytes]], [[neutrophilic|neutrophilic granulocytes]], and [[monocytes]].

The [[CFU-GEMM|common myeloid progenitor]] can [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] in the bone marrow into [[red blood cell]]s and [[megakaryocyte]]s (leading to [[platelet]]s) as well as [[mast cell]]s and [[myeloblast]]s, the latter leading to the [[myelocyte|myelocytic]] line ([[granulocyte]]s) and to [[monocyte]]s, [[macrophage]]s, and [[dendritic cell]]s of the [[innate immune system]]. The granulocytes, also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes because of their multilobed nuclei, are three short lived cell types including [[eosinophil]]s, [[basophil]]s, and [[neutrophil]]s. A granulocyte differentiates into a distinct cell type by a process called [[granulopoiesis]]. In this process it first transforms from a common [[myeloblast]] (myeloid progenitor) to a common promyelocyte. This promyelocyte gives rise to a unique myelocyte that for the first time can be classified as an eosinophil, basophil, or neutrophil progenitor based on the histological staining affinity (eosinophilic, basophilic, or neutral granules).&lt;ref&gt;Junqueira, Carneiro. Basic Histology, Text and Atlas.McGraw-Hill Companies. 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-07-144116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unique myelocyte next differentiates into a metamyelocyte and then a [[band cell]], with a "C" shaped nucleus, before becoming a mature eosinophil, basophil, or neutrophil. Macrophages come from monoblast progenitors that differentriate into [[promonocytes]], which mature into [[monocytes]]. Monocytes eventually enter the tissues and become [[macrophages]].

A '''nullor''' is a theoretical [[two-port network]] consisting of a [[nullator]] at its input and a [[norator]] at its output.&lt;ref&gt;The name "nullor" was introduced by H. J. Carlin, ''Singular network elements'', IEEE Trans. Circuit Theory, March 1965, vol. CT-11, p. 67–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Nullors represent an ideal [[amplifier]], having infinite [[Electronic amplifier#Input and output variables|current, voltage, transconductance and transimpedance]] gain.&lt;ref name=Verhoeven&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Two-port network#ABCD-parameters|transmission parameters]] are all zero, that is, its input–output behavior is summarized with the matrix equation
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{pmatrix}
v_1\\
i_1
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 \\ 
  0 &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
v_2\\
i_2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
In [[negative-feedback]] circuits, the circuit surrounding the nullor determines the nullor output in such a way as to force the nullor input to zero.

Inserting a nullor in a circuit schematic imposes mathematical constraints on how that circuit must behave, forcing the circuit itself to adopt whatever arrangements are needed to meet the conditions. For example, an ideal [[operational amplifier]] can be modeled using a nullor,&lt;ref name=Verhoeven2&gt;{{cite book 
|author1=Verhoeven C. J. M. |author2=van Staveren A. |author3=Monna G. L. E. |author4=Kouwenhoven M. H. L. |author5=Yildiz E. |title=§2.6

&lt;/ref&gt; and the textbook analysis of a feedback circuit using an ideal op-amp uses the mathematical conditions imposed by the nullor to analyze the circuit surrounding the op-amp.

== Example: voltage-controlled current sink ==
[[File:Nullor circuit.svg|thumb|Figure 1: Current sink based on an operational amplifier. Because the op-amp is modeled as a nullor, its input variables are zero regardless of the values of its output variables.]]
Figure 1 shows a voltage-controlled current sink.&lt;ref name=Spencer&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The sink is intended to draw the same current ''i''&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; regardless of the applied voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; at the output. The value of current drawn is to be set by the input voltage ''v''&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. Here the sink is to be analyzed by idealizing the op amp as a nullor.

Using properties of the input nullator portion of the nullor, the input voltage across the op amp input terminals is zero. Consequently, the voltage across reference resistor ''R''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the applied voltage ''v''&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;, making the current in ''R''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; simply ''v''&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. Again using the nullator properties, the input current to the nullor is zero. Consequently, [[Kirchhoff's current law]] at the emitter provides an emitter current of ''v''&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. Using properties of the norator output portion of the nullor, the nullor provides whatever current is demanded of it, regardless of the voltage at its output. In this case, it provides the transistor base current ''i''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, Kirchhoff's current law applied to the transistor as a whole provides the output current drawn through resistor ''R''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; i_\text{OUT} = \frac {v_\text{IN}} {R_\text{R}} - i_\text{B} &lt;/math&gt;

where the base current of the bipolar transistor ''i''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is normally negligible provided the transistor remains in [[Bipolar junction transistor#Regions of operation|active mode]]. That is, based upon the idealization of a nullor, the output current is controlled by the user-applied input voltage ''v''&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and the designer's choice for the reference resistor ''R''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;.

The purpose of the transistor in the circuit is to reduce the portion of the current in ''R''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; supplied by the op-amp. Without the transistor, the current through ''R''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; would be ''i''&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = (''V''&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;)/''R''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;, which interferes with the design goal of independence of ''i''&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; from ''V''&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;. Another practical advantage of the transistor is that the op amp must deliver only  the small transistor base current, which is unlikely to tax the op amp's current delivery capability. Of course, only real op amps are current-limited, not nullors.

The remaining variation of the current with the voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; is due to the [[Early effect]], which causes the β of the transistor to change with its collector-to-base voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;CB&lt;/sub&gt; according to the relation β = β&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1 + ''V''&lt;sub&gt;CB&lt;/sub&gt;/''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the so-called Early voltage. Analysis based upon a nullor leads to the [[output resistance]] of this current sink as ''R''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;(β + 1) + ''R''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; is the small-signal transistor output resistance given by ''r''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; = (''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; + ''V''&lt;sub&gt;CB&lt;/sub&gt;)/''i''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;. See [[Current mirror#Output resistance 3|current mirror]] for the analysis.

Use of the nullor idealization allows design of the circuitry around the op-amp. The practical problem remains of designing an op-amp that behaves like a nullor.

== Branches of forestry ==
* [[Agroforestry]] – integration of forests into agricultural systems in order to optimize the production and positive effects within the system and minimize negative side effects of farming
* [[Taiga#Human activities|Boreal forestry]] – analyzes the particular challenges of forestry in the world's [[Taiga|boreal]] regions
* [[Close to nature forestry]] &amp;ndash; theory and practice that takes the forest as an ecosystem and manages it as such. It is based on reduced human intervention, that should be directed to accelerate the processes that nature would do by itself more slowly.
* [[Dendrology]] – involves the study and identification of economically useful tree species
* [[Energy forestry]] – includes specifically managing for the production of energy from biomass or biofuel derived from a fast-growing species of tree or woody shrub
* [[Forest ecology]] – studies the patterns and processes of a forest ecosystem
* [[Forest economics]] – studies the impact of economics on forest management decisions
* [[Interception (water)|Forest hydrology]] – embodies the effects of changes in forest land use on the movement, distribution, and quality of water in the ecosystem
* [[Forest inventory|Forest mensuration]] – incorporates quantitative measurements of the forest [[Stand level modelling|stand]] to determine stand timber volume and productivity/health, and provides a basis off which management decisions can be made
* [[Forest pathology]] – research of both biotic and abiotic maladies affecting the health of the forest or tree, primarily fungal pathogens and their insect vectors
* [[Silviculture]] – is the art and science of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests to meet specific objectives
* [[Social forestry]] – addresses human-forest interactions, and the importance of community-based [[natural resource management]]
* [[Sustainable forestry]] – emphasizes forest management for long-term environmental, social, and economic [[sustainability]]

=== Forest management ===
[[Forest management]] &amp;ndash; comprises the overall administrative, economic, legal, and social aspects of forest regulation
* [[Analog forestry]] &amp;ndash; a management focus that seeks to establish a tree-dominated ecosystem that is similar in architectural structure and ecological function to the naturally occurring climax and sub-climax vegetation community
* [[Bamboo#Cultivation|Bamboo cultivation]] &amp;ndash; farming and harvesting bamboo for commercial purposes such as construction.

{{Further|Wood processing}}
[[Forest product]] &amp;ndash; any material derived from a forest for direct consumption or commercial use, such as lumber, paper, or forage for livestock. Wood is by far the dominant forest product, used for fuel (as firewood or charcoal), structural materials in the construction of buildings, or as a raw material, such as wood pulp used in the production of paper. All non-wood products derived from forest resources are called non-timber forest products.

'''Pedro Francisco Duque Duque''', [[Order of Friendship|OF]], [[Medal "For Merit in Space Exploration"|OMSE]] ([[Madrid]], 14 March 1963) is a Spanish [[astronaut]] and [[aeronautics engineer]], currently serving as Spain's Minister of Science, Innovation and Universities. He was the first Spanish astronaut.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Born in Madrid in 1963. The son of an agricultural engineer who worked as an air traffic controller and a housewife from [[Badajoz]]. In 1986 Duque earned a degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the [[Universidad Politécnica de Madrid]]. In 1986 he worked for [[GMV, S.A.|GMV]] and for the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) for six years before being selected as an astronaut candidate in 1992.

=== Astronaut ===
Duque underwent training in both Russia and the United States. His first spaceflight was as a mission specialist aboard [[space shuttle]] mission [[STS-95]], during which Duque supervised ESA experimental modules. In October 2003, Duque visited the [[International Space Station]] on board of a Soyuz TMA Ship for several days during a crew changeover.  The scientific program of this visit was called by ESA/Spain [http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Cervantes_Mission Misión Cervantes].

=== University and Business ===
In 2003 he started working at UPM School of Aeronautical Engineers as head of operations of the Spanish USOC, also lecturing students on space science and operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=El Astronauta e Ingeniero Aeronáutico Pedro Duque "ficha" por su Escuela | url=http://www.aero.upm.es/es/pedro_duque/pedro_duque.html |date=21 October 2004 |access-date=28 April 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041208085022/http://www.aero.upm.es/es/pedro_duque/pedro_duque.html |archive-date=8 December 2004 |language=es |work=Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros Aeronaúticos |publisher=[[Universidad Politécnica de Madrid]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006 Duque was named managing director of Deimos Imaging, a private company, that in 2009 put in orbit the first Spanish earth observation satellite (Deimos 1) with uses in agriculture, forestry wildfire detection and control. In 2011 he was named CEO of the Company.

=== Return to the ESA ===
In October 2011 Duque returned to his position in the European Space Agency, retaking his position as an atronaut. Until 2015 he was the leader of the Flight Operations Office, with responsibility for ESA operations in the ISS. After that he assumed the responsibility of the review of future ESA manned flights, within the [[European Astronaut Corps|ESA's astronaut corps]].

=== Minister ===
After the success of the [[2018 vote of no confidence in the government of Mariano Rajoy|motion of no confidence]] against the Spanish government in June 2018, Prime Minister [[Pedro Sánchez (politician)|Pedro Sanchez]] named Pedro Duque Minister of Science, Innovation and Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Astronaut Pedro Duque appointed to Spain's new Cabinet| url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/06/europe/spain-cabinet-astronaut-women-intl/index.html|date=6 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Programming the Universe: A Quantum Computer Scientist Takes On the Cosmos''''' is a 2006 [[popular science]] book by [[Seth Lloyd]], professor of mechanical engineering at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. The book proposes that the universe is a [[quantum computer]], and advances in the understanding of physics may come from viewing [[entropy]] as a phenomenon of information, rather than simply [[thermodynamics]].  Lloyd also postulates that the universe can be fully simulated using a quantum computer; however, in the absence of a theory of [[quantum gravity]], such a simulation is not yet possible.

==Reaction==
Reviewer [[Corey S. Powell]] of ''The New York Times'' writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the space of 221 dense, frequently thrilling and occasionally exasperating pages, …  tackles computer logic, thermodynamics, chaos theory, complexity, quantum mechanics, cosmology, consciousness, sex and the origin of life — throwing in, for good measure, a heartbreaking afterword that repaints the significance of all that has come before. The source of all this intellectual mayhem is the kind of Big Idea so prevalent in popular science books these days. Lloyd, a professor of mechanical engineering at M.I.T., takes as his topic the fundamental workings of the universe…, which he thinks has been horribly misunderstood. Scientists have looked at it as a ragtag collection of particles and fields while failing to see what it is as a majestic whole: an enormous computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, Lloyd writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;everything in the universe is made of bits. Not chunks of stuff, but chunks of information — ones and zeros. … Atoms and electrons are bits. Atomic collisions are "ops." Machine language is the laws of physics. The universe is a quantum computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gilbert Taylor, writing in ''[[Booklist]]'' of the [[American Library Association]], said that the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;offers brilliantly clarifying explanations of the "bit," the smallest unit of information; how bits change their state; and how changes-of-state can be registered on atoms via quantum-mechanical qualities such as "spin" and "superposition." Putting readers in the know about quantum computation, Lloyd then informs them that it may well be the answer to physicists' search for a unified theory of everything. Exploring big questions in accessible, comprehensive fashion, Lloyd's work is of vital importance to the general-science audience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400033861 Quoted on the Amazon website.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''proton spin crisis''' (sometimes called the "proton spin puzzle") is a theoretical crisis precipitated by an experiment in 1987&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30400893_A_MEASUREMENT_OF_THE_SPIN_ASYMMETRY_AND_DETERMINATION_OF_THE_STRUCTURE_FUNCTION_g1_IN_DEEP_INELASTIC_MUON_-_PROTON_SCATTERING&lt;/ref&gt; which tried to determine the spin configuration of the [[proton]]. The experiment was carried out by the [[European Muon Collaboration]] (EMC).&lt;ref&gt;

Physicists expected that the [[quark]]s carry all the proton [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. However, not only was the total proton spin carried by quarks far smaller than 100%, these results were consistent with almost zero (4–24%&lt;ref&gt;http://phys.org/news/2015-06-scientists-brink-proton.html&lt;/ref&gt;) proton spin being carried by quarks. This surprising and puzzling result was termed the "proton spin crisis".&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==

A key question is how the nucleon's spin is distributed amongst its constituent [[parton (particle physics)|parton]]s ([[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s). Physicists originally expected that quarks carry all of the nucleon spin.

A proton is built from three valence quarks (two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]]), gluons, and [[Virtual particle|virtual]] (or ''sea'') quarks and antiquarks (which do not influence the proton's quantum numbers). The ruling assumption was that since the [[proton#Stability|proton is stable]], then it exists in the lowest possible energy level. Therefore, it was expected that the quark's [[wave function]] is the spherically symmetric [[Atomic orbital|s-wave]] with no spatial contribution to angular momentum. The proton is, like each of its quarks, a spin 1/2 particle. Therefore, it was assumed that two of the quarks have their spins parallel to the proton's and the spin of the third quark is opposite.

==The experiment==

In this EMC experiment, a quark of a polarized proton target was hit by a polarized [[muon]] beam, and the quark's instantaneous spin was measured. In a polarized proton target, all the protons' spin take the same direction, and therefore it was expected that the spin of two out of the three quarks cancels out and the spin of the third quark is polarized in the direction of the proton's spin. Thus, the sum of the quarks' spin was expected to be equal to the proton's spin.

However, it was found in this EMC experiment that the number of quarks with spin in the proton's spin direction was almost the same as the number of quarks whose spin was in the opposite direction. This is the proton spin crisis. Similar results have been obtained in later experiments.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent work==
A 2008 work shows that more than half of the spin of the proton comes from the spin of its quarks, and that the missing spin is produced by the quarks' orbital [[angular momentum]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Rolando fracture''' is a [[Bone fracture|comminuted]] [[intra-articular]] [[fracture]] through the base of the [[first metacarpal bone]] (the first bone forming the [[thumb]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/rolandos_fracture&lt;/ref&gt;). It was first described in 1910 by Silvio Rolando.&lt;ref&gt;Rolando S. Fracture de la base du premier metacarpien et principalement sur une variete` non encore e`crite. Presse Med 1910;33:303–4 [in French].&lt;/ref&gt; This is a fracture consisting of 3 distinct fragments; it is typically T- or Y-shaped.

==Treatment==
There are several proposed methods of treatment. The quality of reduction does not correlate with late symptoms and osteoarthritic changes. Despite this fact, the joint surface should be restored as close to its anatomical position as possible.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
Some advocate fixation with Kirschner wires, or plate and screw constructions.
Another accepted treatment is an [[external fixator]] accompanied by the tension band wiring technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=FM|title=Fractures of the basal joint of the thumb.|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|date=Jul 1987|issue=220|pages=46–51|pmid=3595009|doi=10.1097/00003086-198707000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tension band wiring is a technique in which the bone fragments are transfixed by [[Kirschner wire]]s, which are then also used as an anchor for a loop of flexible wire. As the loop is tightened the bone fragments are compressed together.

==Prognosis==
The Rolando fracture is less common than the [[Bennett's fracture]], and is associated with a worse prognosis.

The '''Royal Institution of Great Britain''' (often abbreviated as the '''Royal Institution''' or '''Ri''') is an organisation devoted to scientific education and research, based in London.
It was founded in 1799 by the leading British scientists of the age including [[Henry Cavendish]] and its first president, [[George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea|George Finch, the 9th Earl of Winchilsea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caroe|first=Gwendy Caroe, with a final chapter by Alban|title=The Royal Institution : an informal history|year=1985|publisher=J. Murray|location=London|isbn=0719542456}}&lt;/ref&gt; for diffusing the knowledge, and facilitating the general introduction, of useful mechanical inventions and improvements; and for teaching, by courses of philosophical lectures and experiments, the application of science to the common purposes of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guides to the Royal Institution of Great Britain: 1 HISTORY|url=http://www.rigb.org/docs/brief_history_of_ri_1.pdf|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[File:Henry Jamyn Brooks - A Friday Evening Discourse at the Royal Institution; Sir James Dewar on Liquid Hydrogen, 1904.jpg|thumb|''A Friday Evening Discourse at the Royal Institution; Sir James Dewar on Liquid Hydrogen'' by [[Henry Jamyn Brooks]], 1904]]Much of the Institution's initial funding and the initial proposal for its founding were given by the Society for Bettering the Conditions and Improving the Comforts of the Poor, under the guidance of philanthropist [[Sir Thomas Bernard, 3rd Baronet|Sir Thomas Bernard]] and American-born British scientist Sir [[Benjamin Thompson]], Count Rumford. Since its founding it has been based at 21 [[Albemarle Street]] in [[Mayfair]]. Its [[Royal Charter]] was granted in 1800.

==History==
[[Image:Faraday Michael Christmas lecture detail.jpg|thumb|Michael Faraday's 1856 Christmas Lecture]]
Throughout its history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history|title=History of The Royal Institution, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Institution has supported public engagement with science through a programme of lectures, many of which continue today. The most famous of these are the annual [http://www.rigb.org.uk/christmas-lectures Royal Institution Christmas Lectures], founded by [[Michael Faraday]].
The Royal Institution was founded as the result of a proposal by the American-born [[Bavaria|Bavarian]] [[Count Rumford]] for the "formation by Subscription, in the Metropolis of the British Empire, of a Public Institution for diffusing the Knowledge and facilitating the general Introduction of useful Mechanical Inventions and Improvements, and for the teaching by courses of Philosophical Lectures and Experiments, the application of Science to the Common Purposes of Life"&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|author=G. I. Brown |title ="The Royal Institution" in ''COUNT RUMFORD The Extraordinary Life of a Scientific Genius'' (Sutton Publishing, 1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The first Professor and Public Lecturer in Experimental Philosophy, Mechanics and Chemistry was [[Thomas Garnett (physician)|Dr Thomas Garnett]], whom Rumford poached from the newly founded [[Strathclyde University|Andersonian Instute]] in Glasgow. Despite Garnett's first lectures being a great success, his salary was frozen, he was not allowed to practise as a doctor, and [[Humphry Davy]] was appointed as his assistant, so he resigned.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; Humphry Davy was an even greater success, as was his assistant and successor Michael Faraday. Davy's immediate successor was [[William Thomas Brande]].

Thus the Institution has had an instrumental role in the advancement of science since its founding. Notable scientists who have worked there include Sir [[Humphry Davy]] (who discovered [[sodium]] and [[potassium]]), [[Michael Faraday]], [[James Dewar]], Sir [[William Henry Bragg]] and Sir [[William Lawrence Bragg]] (who jointly won the Nobel prize for their work on x-ray diffraction), [[Max Perutz]], [[John Kendrew]], [[Antony Hewish]], and [[George Porter]]. 
[[File:Royal Institution Lecture Theatre.jpg|thumb|The Royal Institution Lecture Theatre. Here Michael Faraday first demonstrated electromagnetism]]
In the 19th century, Faraday&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history/michael-faraday|title=Michael Faraday at the Royal Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt; carried out much of the research which laid the groundwork for the practical exploitation of electricity at the Royal Institution. In total fifteen scientists attached to the Royal Institution have won Nobel Prizes. Ten chemical elements including [[sodium]] were discovered there; the electric generator was devised at the Institution, and much of the early work on the atomic structure of crystals was carried out within it.

===Chemical elements===
{{Div col}}
# [[Potassium]] – isolated from caustic potash by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1807 using electrolysis.
# [[Sodium]] – Humphry Davy first isolated sodium in 1807 from molten sodium hydroxide.
# [[Barium]] – isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts by Humphry Davy in 1808.
# [[Boron]] – discovered by Humphry Davy who first used electrolysis to produce a brown precipitate from a solution of borates in 1808. He produced enough of the substance to identify it as an element but pure boron was not produced until 1909.
# [[Calcium]] – isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808 from a mixture of lime and mercuric oxide using electrolysis.
# [[Chlorine]] – Elemental chlorine was discovered in 1774 but was thought to be a compound and was called "dephlogisticated muriatic acid air". Humphry Davy named it chlorine in 1810 after experimenting with it and declared it was an element.
# [[Magnesium]] – first produced and discovered in 1808 by Humphry Davy using electrolysis of a mixture of magnesia and mercury oxide.
# [[Strontium]] – known in mineral form but isolated as an element in 1808 by [[Humphry Davy]] from a mixture of strontium chloride and mercuric acid.
# [[Iodine]] – Discovered by [[Bernard Courtois]] in 1811, he lacked the resources to investigate the substance but gave samples to various researchers. It was named by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac who thought it either a compound of oxygen or an element. A few days later [[Humphry Davy]] stated it was a new element leading to wrangling between the two over who identified it first.
# [[Argon]] – discovered in 1894 by [[Lord Rayleigh]] and William Ramsey.

===Past Directors===
{{Main article|Directors of the Royal Institution}}

The leadership of the Royal Institution has had various titles:
* Director of the Laboratory
* Director of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory
* Director

The position was abolished in 2010.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/6968961/Baroness-Greenfields-redundancy-only-way-to-get-rid-of-her.html |title=Baroness Greenfield's redundancy 'only way to get rid of her' |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |author1=Gammell, Caroline |author2= Alleyne, Richard |date=12 January 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institution's last director was [[Susan Greenfield]].

[[Sarah Harper]], Professor of Gerontology at the University of Oxford, was announced as the new Director of the Ri in April 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigb.org/about/news/spring-2017/director-announcement|title=Ri Trustees appoint Professor Sarah Harper as Director|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resigned in September 2017.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigb.org/about/news/autumn-2017/the-royal-institution-confirms-the-departure-of-it|title=The Royal Institution (Ri) confirms the departure of its Director, Professor Sarah Harper|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andrade controversy===
In 1952, [[Edward Andrade]] was forced to resign following a complicated controversy over the management of the Royal Institution and his powers as director, involving a power struggle with [[Alexander Rankine]] who was secretary. Following various resignations and general meetings of members, Andrade was awarded £7,000 by arbitration: the arbitrators blamed the problems on "a lack of clear definition of roles&amp;nbsp;... an outdated constitution, and the inability of the protagonists to compromise". Andrade launched a lawsuit to set the arbitration aside, which he lost.&lt;ref&gt;Frank James &amp; Vivianne Quirke "L'Affaire Andrade" in ''The Common Purposes of Life'' (Ashgate, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenfield controversy===
From 1998 to 8 January 2010, the director of the Royal Institution was [[Susan Greenfield|Baroness Susan Greenfield]], but following a review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8402701.stm |title= Science body confirms review |accessdate=9 January 2010 |work= BBC News |date=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the position was abolished for being "no longer affordable".&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; The Royal Institution had found itself in a financial crisis following a £22 million development programme led by Greenfield, which included refurbishment of the institution's main Albemarle Street building, and the addition of a restaurant and bar with an aim to turn the venue into a "[[Groucho club]] for science". The project ended £3 million in debt.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=McKie, Robin |author2=Syal, Rajeev |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/jan/10/greenfield-redundancy-royal-institution |title=Top scientist Susan Greenfield told to quit her job – and her flat |work=The Observer |location= London |date=10 January 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenfield subsequently announced that she would be suing for discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8449718.stm |title=Royal Institution former chief suing for discrimination |accessdate=9 January 2010 |work=BBC News |date=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The RI's official statement stated it would "continue to deliver its main charitable objectives under the direction of chief executive officer, Chris Rofe and a talented senior team including [[Quentin Pankhurt|Professor Quentin Pankhurst]], the Director of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory, [[Gail Cardew|Dr Gail Cardew]], the Head of Programmes and Professor Frank James, Head of Collections and Heritage."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&amp;id=00000003906 Press Statement — Baroness Greenfield and the role of Director at the Royal Institution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210094816/http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&amp;id=00000003906 |date=10 February 2010 }}, Royal Institution, UK, 8 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Baroness Greenfield later dropped the discrimination case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/6560/baroness_greenfield_drops_sex_discrimination_case_against_the_royal_institution |title=Baroness Greenfield drops legal action against the Royal Institution |publisher=Civilsociety.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Organization==
[[File:Royal Institution of Great Britain.JPG|thumb|The exterior of the Royal Institution today]]
Today the Royal Institution is committed to "diffusing science for the common purposes of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigb.org.uk/about/mission-and-vision|title=Our mission and vision|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is open to all, with no nomination procedure or academic requirements, on payment of an annual subscription.

The Institution's patrons and trustees include:
* Patron: HRH [[The Prince of Wales]]
* President: HRH [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|The Duke of Kent]]
* Honorary Vice-President: [[John Ritblat|Sir John Ritblat]]
* Chairman: [[Richard Sykes (biochemist)|Sir Richard Sykes]]
* Board of Trustees (current): Dr Fergus Boyd, Dr Sophie Forgan, Simon Godwin, Prof Yike Guo, Lord [[Julian Hunt]], John Krumins, Sarika Patel, Geoff Potter, Louise Terry, Prof Alison Woollard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigb.org/about/organisation Board of Trustees], Royal Institution, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the institution appointed Dr Shaun Fitzgerald FREng as director&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingenia.org.uk/Ingenia/Articles/9a01a1b0-5f64-4bba-9758-7199a9002a86|title=Building a sustainable career|website=Ingenia, Issue 76, September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fitzgerald took up the post in April 2018. In July 2018, the institution announced a new five-year strategy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.rigb.org/about/news/summer-2018/ri-launches-five-year-strategy|title=Royal Institution launches new five year strategy|website=Royal Institution, 10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; running from October 2018 to September 2023. The strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigb.org/about/organisation/our-strategy|title=Our strategy|website=The Royal Institution|access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which sets out to double the charity's size, involves "plans for new research, development of a new national science club and open forum public policy debates". One new venture will be a Research Centre for Science and Culture, working with other academic groups, this "will investigate historical and contemporary examples of the relationship between science and culture".

The institution's palatial home has been greatly enlarged and redeveloped since 1799, and is a Grade I [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|208514|21 Albemarle Street- Grade I|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|208513|20 Albemarle Street – Grade I|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure's last refurbishment was a £22 million project completed in 2008, intended to create a "science salon" for the public. As well as the famous Lecture Theatre, the building contains several function rooms, modern research facilities and a public café. The trustees were considering selling the building in an effort to recoup the organisation's debts, which amounted to £7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jha, Alok |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jan/18/royal-institution-building-for-sale |title=Royal Institution puts historic Mayfair building up for sale |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 The Ri received an anonymous donation of £4.4m&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/mar/19/royal-institution-rescued-donation|title=Royal Institution rescued by £4.4m donation|last=Sample|first=Ian|date=19 March 2013|last2=correspondent|first2=science|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of January 2016, the Ri is now debt-free.

The Institution (today abbreviated as the '''Ri''') has a substantial public science programme and science for schools programme, holding over one hundred events per year on a wide variety of topics. The [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas Lectures]] continue today as a series of three televised lectures aimed at children. The Friday Evening Discourses are monthly lectures given by eminent scientists, each limited to exactly one hour, a tradition started by Faraday. There is an annual members' ballot&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rigb.org.uk/christmas-lectures/christmas-lectures-tickets|title=CHRISTMAS LECTURES tickets {{!}} The Royal Institution: Science Lives Here|website=www.rigb.org.uk|access-date=11 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422123225/http://www.rigb.org.uk/christmas-lectures/christmas-lectures-tickets|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for tickets to the Christmas Lectures but all other events are open to the public. Discounts or free tickets are available to Ri Patrons and Members. Many other events and lectures are held both at Albemarle Street and at other venues around the country.

Scientific research headed by Professor Quentin Pankhurst&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/media/library/QuentinPankhurstAndRIFINAL|title=Professor Quentin Pankhurst to head the new Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory at the Royal Institution|website=www.ucl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; continues to be done under the auspices of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory (DFRL), and indeed this is considered to be one of the UK's most notable labs in nano-science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title= Professor Quentin Pankhurst to head the new Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory at the Royal Institution |url= http://www.ucl.ac.uk/media/library/QuentinPankhurstAndRIFINAL |publisher= University College London |date=29 April 2008 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, The Royal Institution was host to the historic unveiling of the Santara Computer, created by Dr Andrew Deonarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/santarafnd|title=Santara Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 a new membership scheme was launched and Fellows of the Ri were abolished. The new scheme includes the categories Member, Under 26 and Ri Young Member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigb.org/globals/join-support|title=Join and support|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Patrons scheme has also been introduced for the first time.

In December 2011 the Royal Institution launched the Ri Channel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://richannel.org Ri Channel] www.richannel.org&lt;/ref&gt; a new website displaying science videos and archive content from the Royal Institution, including past [[Christmas Lectures]]. The Ri Channel was archived in late 2017 with all Ri videos except past Christmas Lectures being hosted on YouTube. Past Christmas Lectures are hosted on the Ri's website and in early 2018 the Ri began a to upload all past Christmas Lectures that were not already available on its website.

Despite its noble history, the Royal Institution has now become a mixed tenancy office building that hosts conferences, weddings and events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venue.rigb.org/|title=The Royal Institution - Venue Hire|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to pay its bills. In 2015 it sold part of its historic collection of manuscripts to raise funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/21/royal-institution-to-sell-historic-treasures-to-rescue-finances|title=Royal Institution to sell science treasures to rescue finances|author=Richard Lea|work=the Guardian|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34699008|title=Does the Royal Institution have a future?|publisher=BBC News|access-date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a room in the Institution was used in an experiment on moral ethics for the US TV scientific show ''[[Braingames]]''.

In 1973 the Royal Institution opened the '''Faraday Museum'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, a museum dedicated to [[Michael Faraday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigb.org.uk/visit-us/faraday-museum|title=The Faraday Museum|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the main building in Albemarle Street and is open to the public during weekday office hours. The highlight of the exhibition is Faraday's original 1850s laboratory (not a reconstruction as often cited). Opposite this lab is the current state-of-the-art nanotechnology lab.  Other exhibits include the discoveries, people and activities of the Royal Institution.

'''SLinCA@Home''' (Scaling Laws in Cluster Aggregation) was a research project that uses Internet-connected computers to do research in fields such as [[physics]] and [[materials science]].

==Introduction==
SLinCA@Home is based at the [[G.V.Kurdyumov Institute for Metal Physics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|G. V. Kurdyumov Institute for Metal Physics (IMP)]] of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] (NASU) in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]'s [[capital city]]. It runs on the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC)]] software platform, the [[SZTAKI Desktop Grid]] platform, and the Distributed Computing [[API]] (DC-API) by SZTAKI. SLinCA@Home hosts several scientific applications dedicated to research into [[Scale invariance|scale-invariant]] dependencies in experimental data and computer simulation results.

==History==
The SLinCA@Home project was previously launched in January 2009 as part of the [[Enabling Grids for E-sciencE|EGEE]] project in the [[European Union]]'s [[Seventh Framework Programme]] (FP7) for the funding of research and technological development in Europe. During 2009–2010 it used the power of a local IMP Desktop Grid (DG), but from December 2010 it has been using the power of [[Volunteering|volunteer]]-driven [[distributed computing]] in solving the computationally intensive problems involved in research into scale-invariant dependencies in experimentally obtained and simulated scientific data. It is now operated by a group of scientists from IMP NASU in close cooperation with partners from [http://desktopgridfederation.org IDGF] and the [http://distributed.org.ua 'Ukraine' Distributed Computing team]. From June 2010 SLinCA@Home has been under the framework of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110221222800/http://degisco.eu/ DEGISCO] FP7 EU project.

==Current status==
[[File:SLinCA@Home performance28day.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[http://dg.imp.kiev.ua/slinca/performance.php SLinCA@Home&amp;nbsp;– last 4 weeks performance], as of March 16, 2011]]
Currently, SLinCA@Home is considered to be in alpha-test, due to gradual upgrades of the server and client parts.

By informal statistics at [http://boincstats.com/en/stats/111/project/detail/user the BOINCstats site] (as of 16 March 2011), over 2,000 volunteers in 39 countries have participated in the project; it is the second most popular BOINC project in Ukraine (after the [http://www.fti.dn.ua/magnetism/ Magnetism@Home] project, which is now inactive).&lt;ref name="boincstats"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://boincstats.com/en/stats/111/project/detail/ |title=BOINCstats project statistics |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 700 active users contribute about 0.5–1.5 [[FLOPS|teraFLOPS]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dg.imp.kiev.ua/slinca/performance.php SLinCA@Home Server Status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221055441/http://dg.imp.kiev.ua/slinca/performance.php |date=February 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of computational power, which would rank SLinCA@Home among the top 20 on the [[TOP500]] list of [[supercomputer]]s&amp;nbsp;– if this were June 2005.&lt;ref name="top500_2005"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.top500.org/list/2005/06/500 |date=June 2005 |title=Comparison with TOP500 supercomputers |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, one application (SLinCA) is running publicly using IMP Desktop Grid (DG) infrastructure ([https://archive.is/20130113204738/http://dg.imp.kiev.ua/ SLinCA@Home]); three others (MultiScaleIVideoP, CPDynSG, and LAMMPS over DCI) are being tested internally at IMP.

The SLinCA (Scaling Laws in Cluster Aggregation) application was the first one ported to the DG infrastructure by the Physics of Deformation Processes Lab at IMP NASU. Its goal is to find scale-invariant laws in kinetic scenarios of monomer aggregation in [[monomer clusters|clusters]] of different kinds in multiple scientific domains.

The processes of agent aggregation into clusters are investigated in many branches of science: [[crystallographic defect|defect]] aggregation in [[materials science]], [[population dynamics]] in biology, city [[demographic gravitation|growth]] and evolution in [[urban sociology|sociology]], etc. Experimental data exist confirming evolving structures, which tends to be hierarchical on many scales. The available theories give rise to many scenarios of cluster aggregation and the formation of hierarchical structures, and predict various scaling properties. However, there are huge databases of experimental data, which require powerful computational resources for hierarchical processing. A typical simulation of one cluster aggregation process with 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; monomers takes approximately 1–7 days on a single modern [[Central processing unit|CPU]], depending on the number of [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] steps (MCS).

Deploying SLinCA on a [[Grid computing]] infrastructure, utilising hundreds of machines at the same time, allows harnessing sufficient computational power to undertake simulations on a larger scale and in a much shorter timeframe. Running the simulations and analysing the results on the Grid provides the required significant computational power.

The technical characteristics of running the Desktop Grid-enabled version of the SLinCA application based on the IMP Desktop Grid infrastructure ([https://archive.is/20130113204738/http://dg.imp.kiev.ua/ SLinCA@Home]) are:
* One work-unit per one [[Central processing unit|CPU]] core (2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz) usually requires ~2–4 hours, less than 60 MB of [[RAM|memory]], and less than 40 MB of [[Hard disk drive|hard drive]] space.
* [[Checkpointing]] is not available, but is under test.
* The timing of work-unit progress is nonlinear.

====SLinCA: Scientific Results====
The previous scientific results of the SLinCA application were obtained on [[European Grid Infrastructure|EGEE]] computing resources at [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720161014/https://wiki.eu-euforia.eu/index.php/CIEMAT CETA-CIEMAT] and [http://www.xtremweb-hep.org/spip.php?rubrique13 XtremWeb-HEP] Laboratoire de l'accélérateur linéaire test infrastructures{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=What exactly is meant by the previous?}} were reported in March 29–30, 2009 during the poster session at the [http://www.edges-grid.eu/web/userforum/4thtraining 4th EGEE training event and 3rd AlmereGrid Workshop], in [[Almere]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="SLinCA-4EDgeS"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.edges-grid.eu:8080/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=11065&amp;folderId=80175&amp;name=DLFE-1626.pdf |format=PDF |title=Kinetics of Defect Aggregation in Materials Science Simulated in Desktop Grid Computing Environment Installed in Ordinary Material Science Lab |conference=AlmereGrid Workshop |booktitle=Proceedings of 3rd AlmereGrid Workshop |first1=O |last1=Gatsenko |first2=O |last2=Baskova |first3=Yuri |last3=Gordienko |date=March 2009 |accessdate=March 16, 2011 |location=[[Almere]], [[Netherlands]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223182201/http://www.edges-grid.eu:8080/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=11065&amp;folderId=80175&amp;name=DLFE-1626.pdf |archivedate=February 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SLinCA: Plans====
Current plans for the SLinCA application are for stable checkpointing, some new functionality, and supporting [[NVIDIA]] [[GPU computing]] for faster computation; the last is predicted to make SLinCA from 50% to 200% faster.

===Multiscale Image and Video Processing (MultiScaleIVideoP)===

[[Optical microscopy]] is usually used for structural characterization of materials in a narrow range of magnification, a small [[region of interest]] (ROI), and without changes during microscopy. But many crucial processes of [[fracture mechanics|damage]] initiation and propagation take place dynamically in a timescale ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; s to 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; s and distance scales from [[micrometer]]s (solitary defects places{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=Places?}}) to centimeters (for correlated linked networks of defects). Multiscale Image and Video Processing (MultiscaleIVideoP) is designed to process the recorded changes in materials under [[deformation (engineering)|mechanical deformation]] in a loading machine (e.g., a [[diamond anvil cell]]). The calculations include many parameters of the physical process (e.g., rate, magnification, illumination conditions, and hardware filters) and image processing parameters (e.g., size distribution, anisotropy, localization, and scaling parameters); thus, the calculations are very slow, requiring more powerful computational resources. Deploying this application on a grid computing infrastructure, utilising hundreds of machines at the same time, allows harnessing sufficient computational power to perform image and video processing on a larger scale and in a much shorter timeframe.

The technical characteristics when running the Desktop Grid-enabled version of the MultiScaleIVideoP application at the IMP are:
* One work-unit per one [[Central processing unit|CPU]] core (2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz) usually requires ~20–30 minutes, less than 200 MB of [[RAM|memory]], and less than 500 MB of [[Hard disk drive|hard drive]] space.
* Checkpointing is not available, but is under test.
* The timing of work-unit progress is linear.

The scientific results of the MultiScaleIVideoP application were obtained on EGEE computing resources at [https://wiki.eu-euforia.eu/index.php/CIEMAT CETA-CIEMAT] and [http://www.xtremweb-hep.org/spip.php?rubrique13 XtremWeb-HEP] Laboratoire de l'accélérateur linéaire test infrastructures{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=What exactly is meant by the previous?}} were reported in March 29–30, 2009 during the poster session at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720155614/http://www.edges-grid.eu/web/userforum/4thtraining 4th EGEE training event and 3rd AlmereGrid Workshop], in Almere, Netherlands.&lt;ref name="MIP-4EDgeS"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.edges-grid.eu:8080/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=11065&amp;folderId=80175&amp;name=DLFE-1627.pdf |format=PDF |title=Porting Multiparametric MATLAB Application for Image and Video Processing to Desktop Grid for High-Performance Distributed Computing |conference=AlmereGrid Workshop |booktitle=Proceedings of 3rd AlmereGrid Workshop |first1=O |last1=Baskova |first2=O |last2=Gatsenko |first3=Yuri |last3=Gordienko |date=March 29–30, 2009 |accessdate=March 16, 2011 |location=[[Almere]], [[Netherlands]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223114434/http://www.edges-grid.eu:8080/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=11065&amp;folderId=80175&amp;name=DLFE-1627.pdf |archivedate=February 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, further scientific results for experiments on cyclic constrained tension of [[aluminum]] foils under video monitoring were reported.&lt;ref name="MIP-KEM"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.scientific.net/KEM.465.306 | title = Statistical Properties of Deformed Single-Crystal Surface under Real-Time Video Monitoring and Processing in the Desktop Grid Distributed Computing Environment |publisher=[http://www.ttp.net/1013-9826.html Key Engineering Materials] |first1=O |last1=Baskova |first2=O |last2=Gatsenko |first3=O |last3=Lodygensky |first4=G |last4=Fedak |first5=Yuri |last5=Gordienko |volume=465 |pages=306–309 |date=January 2011 |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current plans for the MultiScaleIVideoP application are for stable checkpointing, some new functionality, and supporting NVIDIA GPU computing for faster computation; the last is predicted to make MultiScaleIVideoP from 300% to 600% faster.

===City Population Dynamics and Sustainable Growth (CPDynSG)===

In the social sciences, it has been found that the growth of cities (or municipalities, lands, counties, etc.) can be explained by [[human migration|migration]], merges, [[population growth]], and similar phenomena. For example, from the literature one can found that the [[urban hierarchy|city population distribution]] in many countries is consistent with a [[power law]] form in which the exponent t is close to 2. This finding is confirmed qualitatively by data on the populations of various cities during their early histories. The population of essentially every major city grows much faster than each of their countries as a whole over a considerable timespan. However, as cities reach maturity, their growth may slow or their [[depopulation|population]] may even [[urban decay|decline]] for reasons unrelated to preferential [[urbanization|migration]] to still-larger cities. Different theories give varying growth rates, asymptotics,{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=What does this mean?}} and distributions of such populations. It is important to compare the various theories with each other, compare the theories with observations, and make predictions of possible population dynamics and sustainable growth for various subnational, national, and multinational regions. The City Population Dynamics and Sustainable Growth (CPDynSG) application allows investigating the correspondences between model predictions and the vast volume of available long-term historical data.

The technical characteristics when running the Desktop Grid-enabled version of the CPDynSG application at the IMP are:
* One work-unit per one CPU core (2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz) usually requires ~20–30 minutes, less than 20 MB of memory, and less than 50 MB of hard drive space.
* Checkpointing is not available, but is under test.
* The timing of work-unit progress is linear.

====CPDynSG: Scientific Results====
In June–September 2010 some results from porting CPDynSG to the [[Distributed Computing Infrastructure]] (DCI) using BOINC and the SZTAKI Desktop Grid were obtained, specifically analyses of city size distributions in several Central and Eastern European countries. The distinctive isolation{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=Isolation?}} of the city size distribution in Hungary was noted. A very high similarity in the evolution of city size distributions in Ukraine and Poland was discovered. These results were reported during the [http://www.cyfronet.pl/cgw10/programme.html Cracow Grid Workshop'10] (October 11–13, 2010) in oral and poster presentations.&lt;ref name="CGW10-best" /&gt; The poster presentation was awarded the "Best Poster of the Cracow Grid Workshop'10" prize.

====CPDynSG: Plans====
Current plans for the CPDynSG application are for stable checkpointing, some new functionality, and supporting NVIDIA GPU computing for faster computation; the last is predicted to make CPDynSG from 50% to 200% faster.

===Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) over DCI===

One important topic in materials science currently is the development of new [[nanotechnology|nanoscale functional devices]]. However, controlled fabrication of such requires careful selection and tuning of the critical parameters (e.g., elements, interaction potentials, and external influences such as temperature) of atomic [[self-organization]] in designed patterns and structures for nanoscale functional devices. Thus, [[molecular dynamics]] simulations of [[nanofabrication]] processes with brute-force searches through different combinations of parameters are of interest. For this, the very popular open-source package [[LAMMPS|"Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator" (LAMMPS)]] by the [[Sandia National Laboratories]] was selected as a candidate for porting to DCI using the Desktop Grid. In other words, LAMMPS with "parameter sweeping" parallelism can be ported to DCI on DG. Usually, it requires powerful computational resources to simulate nano-objects with many parameters. The typical simulation of an investigated nanostructure under one set of physical parameters&amp;nbsp;— for instance, a single crystal of metal (such as [[aluminium]], [[copper]], or [[molybdenum]]) with 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; atoms using embedded atom potentials for as little as 1–10 picoseconds of simulated physical process&amp;nbsp;— takes approximately 1–7 days on a single modern [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. Deploying LAMMPS on a grid computing infrastructure, utilising hundreds of machines at the same time, allows harnessing sufficient computational power to undertake the simulations in a wider range of physical parameter configurations and a much shorter timeframe.

The technical characteristics when running the Desktop Grid-enabled version of LAMMPS at the IMP are:
* One work-unit per one CPU core (2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz) usually requires ~2–48 hours, less than 500 MB of memory, and less than 1 GB of hard drive space.
* Checkpointing is not available, but is under test.
* The timing of work-unit progress is linear.

====LAMMPS over DCI: Scientific Results====
In September–October 2010 results were obtained and reported in an oral presentation during the [http://www.nas.gov.ua/conferences/nano2010/ International Conference on “Nanostructured materials-2010”]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="LAMMPS-NANO2010"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.nas.gov.ua/conferences/nano2010/program/22/Documents/u79_Gordiyenko.pdf |format=PDF |trans-title=Scale-Invariant Aggregation Kinetics of Nanoscale Defects of Crystalline Structure |title=Масштабно-инвариантная кинетика агрегации наноразмерных дефектов кристаллического строения |language=Russian |publisher=http://www.nas.gov.ua/conferences/nano2010/program/22/Pages/u79.aspx |booktitle=Online Proceedings of “Nanostructured materials-2010” |first1=O |last1=Baskova |first2=O |last2=Gatsenko |first3=O |last3=Gontareva |first4=E |last4=Zasimchuk |first5=Yuri |last5=Gordienko |date=October 19–22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69RwsoFvk?url=http://www.nas.gov.ua/conferences/nano2010/program/22/Documents/u79_Gordiyenko.pdf |archivedate=July 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LAMMPS over DCI: Plans====
Current plans for the LAMMPS over DCI application are for stable checkpointing, some new functionality, and supporting NVIDIA GPU computing for faster computation; the last is predicted to make LAMMPS over DCI from 300% to 500% faster.

An additional goal is migration to the [[OurGrid]] platform for testing and demonstrating potential mechanisms of interoperation between worldwide communities with different DCI paradigms. The OurGrid platform is targeted at the support of [[peer-to-peer]] desktop grids; these are in nature very different from [[volunteer computing]] desktop grids such as the SZTAKI Desktop Grid.

'''''Sawbones''''' is a weekly, [[comedy|comedic]] medical [[podcast]] hosted by Dr. Sydnee McElroy and her husband, podcaster [[Justin McElroy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/tv/my-brother-my-brother-and-me-seeso-show-interview/|title=The McElroy Brothers Talk About Moving From Podcasts To TV|date=2 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is distributed online by [[Maximum Fun]].

In each episode, Sydnee discusses an element of historical medical practice, while Justin provides a comedic foil. The show normally focusses on practices that have long since fallen out of use, and are unusual to modern listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themanual.com/culture/best-podcasts-for-road-trips/|title=Fast-Lane Listening: The Best Podcasts for Road Trips in 2018|date=27 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preen.inquirer.net/45076/beat-holy-week-boredom-6-podcasts|title=Beat Your Holy Week Boredom With These 6 Podcasts|date=15 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Sydnee and Justin McElroy had previously worked together on a short podcast series entitled ''Losing the Sheen'', focused on watching ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''.  The show only lasted nine episodes before the two became tired of it, instead starting a medical podcast based on Sydnee's expertise. While developing the idea for the show, the McElroys decided that it would be irresponsible for them to give medical advice to listeners, even with Sydnee's background. They opted instead to focus on the historical aspects, which had been an interest of Sydnee's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eu.app.com/story/entertainment/events/fan-theory/2017/07/11/sawbones-we-got-this-playing-philadelphia-podcast-festival/465805001/|title='Sawbones,' 'We Got This' playing Philadelphia Podcast Festival|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other shows by the family, such as ''[[My Brother, My Brother and Me]]'', ''Sawbones'' is distributed via the [[Maximum Fun]] network.

''Sawbones'' has on occasion been performed live, such as the November 2nd, 2017 performance at the Keith-Albee Performing Arts Center in [[Huntington, WV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://marshallparthenon.com/15173/news/mcelroy-family-podcasts-to-record-at-keith-albee/|title=McElroy family podcasts to record at Keith-Albee – The Parthenon|first=Rebecca|last=Turnbull|website=marshallparthenon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book spinoff==
In June 2018, a book adaptation of the podcast was announced, under the title ''The Sawbones Book: The Horrifying, Hilarious Road To Modern Medicine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/urine-luck-sawbones-fans-justin-and-sydnee-wrote-a-bo-1827113507|title=Urine luck, Sawbones fans: Justin and Sydnee wrote a book, and we've got the exclusive|first=Katie|last=Rife|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published by [[Weldon Owen]], the book became available in October 2018.&lt;ref name="SawbonesBook"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McElroy |first1=Justin |authorlink1=Justin McElroy |last2=McElroy |first2=Dr. Sydnee |title=The Sawbones Book: The Hilarious, Horrifying Road to Modern Medicine |date=9 October 2018 |publisher=Weldon Owen |isbn=978-1681883816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Shamba Raiders: Memories of a Game Warden''''' was written by [[Bruce Kinloch]].  It is a [[non-fiction]] account of his experiences in Africa and was first published in 1972. It proved so successful that a revised edition came out in 1988, and then again in 2004.

The title refers to the marauding [[African elephant|elephants]] destroying peasant crops, driven by heavy [[poaching]] pressure in wilderness areas, which formed the most urgent task for Kinloch.

That his book is still in demand is a source of pride to him and his wife, Elizabeth, who accompanied him frequently and typed up the notes of his original book. "It is a book that never dies, its contents are as relevant now as ever," she said.

''The Shamba Raiders'' is an account of the struggle to preserve herds of game threatened by modern civilisation, poaching, war and the political and economic changes which have swept Africa in the middle of the last century.  As the Chief Game Warden in [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Malawi]], Kinloch walked the tight rope of retaining Africa's wildlife heritage while safeguarding crops and livelihood of the population, featuring ivory poachers and middlemen as well as uncaring and bigoted officials. 

In particular, the book describes Kinloch's management of the [[Uganda Game and Fisheries Department]] during the introduction of the Protectorate's first National Parks, the introduction of [[Nile Perch]] to the upper [[White Nile|Victoria Nile]], and the creation of the [[College of African Wildlife Management]].

== Overview ==

The book is divided into chapters listed below.&lt;ref name="CB-954"/&gt;

Chapter 1 introduces [[impact crater]]s, now recognized on Earth due to the study of other planetary bodies, most significantly the [[Moon]].  On Earth, impact craters differ from other processes in geology in being rare, from a release of extremely large amounts of energy, and happening in an instant.  It contrasts with other geological forces that mostly take very long periods of time.

Chapter 2 covers the astronomical aspect with [[asteroids]] and [[comets]].  Historical impacts are discussed, including the [[Tunguska event]] of 1908.  There is a table comparing effects from tiny to enormous meteor impacts.

Chapter 3 is about the process of formation of a crater during an [[impact event]].  The propagation of the shock wave leads to progressive stages of contact/compression, excavation and modification. It differentiates simple and [[complex crater|complex]] craters, and multi-ring basins.  Then it covers the [[erosion]] processes that continue after the crater has been made.

Chapter 4 is about [[shock metamorphism]], the unique changes made to rocks by the extreme but brief shock forces of an impact.  The effects include [[shatter cones]], [[planar deformation features|planar deformation features (PDFs)]],&lt;ref group="note" name="PDF"/&gt; selective melting and many others.  The amount of shock metamorphism in the rocks progresses in stages with the amount of pressure that they were exposed to, ranging from fracturing and [[breccia]]tion to vaporization of the rocks and later condensation into glass.

Chapter 5 surveys various [[impactite]]s, meaning shock-metamorphosed rocks, and where they are found in an impact structure based on the pressures in various parts of the cratering process.  The topics include crater-fill breccias, [[ejecta blanket]], [[pseudotachylite]] and impact melt breccias.

Chapter 6 covers impact melts, their volume relative to crater size, melt rocks in the crater, impact melt breccias, dikes &amp; sills, and [[tektite]]s.

Chapter 7 is about finding new impact structures.  It includes search methods and verification using unique features of craters covered earlier.

Chapter 8 looks to the future, considers current problems and subjects for further study.

An appendix "Criteria for recognizing terrestrial impact structures" provides a checklist for use in verification of potential impact sites.

The '''Committee on Science, Space and Technology''' is a [[standing committee|committee]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. It has jurisdiction over non-defense federal scientific [[research]] and development. Specifically, the committee has partial or complete jurisdiction over the following federal agencies: [[NASA]], the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|ATSDR]], [[National Science Foundation|NSF]], [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]], [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]], [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]], the [[U.S. Fire Administration]], and [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]].

== History ==
In the wake of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Sputnik program]] in the late 1950s, Congress created the '''Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration''' in 1958, chaired by majority leader [[John William McCormack]]. This select committee drafted the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]] that created the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). A staff report of the committee, the ''Space Handbook: Astronautics and its Applications'', provided non-technical information about spaceflight to U.S. policy makers.&lt;ref name=nasa/&gt;

The committee also chartered the permanent '''House Committee on Science and Astronautics''', which officially began on January 3, 1959, and was the first new standing committee established in the House since 1946. The name was changed in 1974 to the '''House Committee on Science and Technology'''. The name was changed again in 1987 to the '''House Committee on Science, Space and Technology'''. After the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] gained a majority in Congress in 1994, the name of the committee was changed to the '''House Committee on Science'''. With the return of control to the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] in 2007, the committee's name was changed back to the '''House Committee on Science and Technology'''.

In the 112th Congress, Committee Chairman Ralph Hall added "Space" back into the committee's name: "The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology" – a nod to the committee's history, broad jurisdiction, and the importance of space exploration in maintaining American innovation and competitiveness.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

On December 1, 2016, the committee's [[Twitter]] account posted a link to an article on [[Breitbart]] which argued that [[Climate change denial|climate change was the result of natural weather processes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Feltman |first=Rachel |url=http://www.popsci.com/house-committee-on-science-just-tweeted-science-article-from-breitbart |title=The House Committee on Science just tweeted a 'science' article from Breitbart |date=December 1, 2016 |work=Popular Science |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tweet was criticized by members of the scientific community on Twitter for promoting an unscientific and misleading article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/06/its-likely-earths-warmest-year-on-record-and-people-are-already-talking-about-cooling/|title=It's likely Earth's hottest year on record — and some people are talking about global cooling|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee's Ranking Member [[Eddie Bernice Johnson]] also criticized the tweet, writing, "False news &amp; false facts put us all in danger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McCausland |first=Phil |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/house-science-committee-tweets-climate-change-denying-breitbart-article-debunked-n690986 |title=House Science Committee Tweets Climate-Change Denying Breitbart Article, Debunked by Scientists |work=NBC News |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vis viva''''' (from the [[Latin]] for "living force") is a historical term used for the first (known) description of what we now call [[kinetic energy]] in an  early formulation of the principle of [[conservation of energy]].

==Overview==
Proposed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] over the period 1676–1689, the theory was controversial as it seemed to oppose the theory of [[conservation of momentum]] advocated by Sir [[Isaac Newton]] and [[René Descartes]]. The two theories are now understood to be complementary.

The theory was eventually absorbed into the modern theory of [[energy]] though the term still survives in the context of [[celestial mechanics]] through the [[Vis-viva equation|''vis viva'' equation]].

The term is due to  [[Germany|German]] [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who during 1676–1689 first attempted a mathematical formulation. Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several [[mass]]es, ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' each with [[velocity]] ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') the quantity:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

was conserved. He called this quantity the ''vis viva'' or "living force" of the system. The principle, it is now realised, represents an accurate statement of the conservation of [[kinetic energy]] in [[elastic collision]]s, and is independent of the [[conservation of momentum]]. However, many [[physicist]]s at the time were unaware of this fact and, instead, were influenced by the prestige of Sir [[Isaac Newton]] in [[England]] and of [[René Descartes]] in [[France]], both of whom advanced the [[conservation of momentum]] as a guiding principle. Thus the [[momentum]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\,\!\sum_{i} m_i \mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt;

was held by the rival camp to be the conserved ''vis viva''. It was largely [[engineer]]s such as [[John Smeaton]], [[Peter Ewart]], [[Karl Holtzmann]], [[Gustave-Adolphe Hirn]] and [[Marc Seguin]] who objected that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and who made use of Leibniz's principle. The principle was also championed by some [[chemist]]s such as [[William Hyde Wollaston]].

The French mathematician [[Émilie du Châtelet]], who had a sound grasp of Newtonian mechanics, developed Leibniz's concept and, combining it with the observations of [[Willem 's Gravesande]], showed that ''vis viva'' was dependent on the square of the velocities.

Members of the academic establishment such as [[John Playfair]] were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the [[second law of thermodynamics]] but in the 18th and 19th centuries, the fate of the lost energy was still unknown. Gradually it came to be suspected that the [[heat]] inevitably generated by motion was another form of ''vis viva''. In 1783, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] reviewed the two competing theories of ''vis viva'' and [[caloric theory]].{{ref|LL}}  [[Benjamin Thompson|Count Rumford]]'s 1798 observations of heat generation during the [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring]] of [[cannon]]s added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat. ''Vis viva'' now started to be known as ''energy'', after the term was first used in that sense by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1807.

[[File:Bernoulli-vis-viva-with-0.5-multiplier-1736 (1741).gif|thumb|An excerpt from [[Daniel Bernoulli]]'s article, published in 1741,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bernoulli D.|title=De legibus quibusdam mechanicis…|journal=Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae|year=1741|volume=8|pages=99–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the definition of vis viva with 1/2 multiplier.]]
The recalibration of ''vis viva'' to include the coefficient of a half, namely:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac {1} {2}\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

was largely the result of the work of [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] over the period 1819–1839, although the present-day definition can occasionally be found earlier (e.g., in [[Daniel Bernoulli]] texts).

The former called it the ''quantité de travail'' (quantity of work) and the latter, ''travail mécanique'' (mechanical work) and both championed its use in engineering calculation.

The information supposedly&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsofpa.com/antiquemaps0.htm ''16th Century Pennsylvania Maps'']&lt;/ref&gt; came from Giovanni da Verrazzano's voyage in 1524 (Ambrosian Library in Milan, Italy.)]]
'''Visconte Maggiolo''' (1478 – 1530), also spelled ''Maiollo'' and ''Maiolo'', was an Italian cartographer and sailor.

He was born in [[Genoa]] and maybe he was a fellow [[sailor]] of explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]]. Some historians say that he died of [[malaria]] in 1530; but archival documents show that he was still alive, in Genoa, at least in 1549, although he certainly was already dead in 1561 (Astengo, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;72).

In 1527, he created a map depicting Verrazzano's travels. This map had a major error (so-called "Verrazzano Sea" with his "Verrazzano Isthmus", as Giovanni did not accurately describe the North American continent. This error was not to be fixed for over a century.

A copy of his map was destroyed during World War II. “Sixteenth Century Maps Destroyed in War. It has been learned with much regret that the manuscript world chart of Vesconte de Maiollo, 1527, in the Ambrosiana Library and Art Gallery in Milan, Italy, (the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]])was lost through war damage. A number of libraries, including the American Geographical Society Library at UW Milwaukee, have a full size reproduction of the famous map that was issued in 1905 by the Hispanic Society of America."&lt;ref&gt;“Geographical News.” 1951. The Geographical Review. Volume XLI (1), January 1951, page 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other world maps made by Vesconte Maggiolo: one, by a private collector, is known to scholars for years (Astengo, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;73: 14: “Vesconte de maiollo [SIC] composuit hanc cartam In Janua anno dominy 1531 die VIII novembri: planisfero nautico, proprietà privata”) is dated Genoa, 1531; another kept at a public library in Treviso (in Italian), is dated Genoa, 1549.
