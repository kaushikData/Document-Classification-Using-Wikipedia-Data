'''All-electric range''' (AER) is the driving range of a vehicle using only power from its electric [[battery pack]] to traverse a given [[United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency#Fuel_economy_testing_and_results|driving cycle]].  In the case of a [[battery electric vehicle]], it means the total range per charge.  For a [[plug-in hybrid]] (PHEV), it means the range of the vehicle in [[charge-depleting]] mode. PHEVs can travel considerably further in [[charge-sustaining]] mode which uses both on-board fuel and the battery pack.

Calculating AER is made more complicated because of variations in PHEV design.  A vehicle like the [[Fisker Karma]] that uses a serial hybrid design has a clear AER.  Similarly a vehicle like the [[Chevy Volt|Chevrolet Volt]] which disengages the internal combustion engine (ICE) from the drive train while in electric mode has a clear AER, however blended mode PHEVs which use the ICE and electric motor in conjunction do not have a clear AER because they use gasoline and grid provided electricity at the same time.  ''Equivalent AER'' is the AER of vehicles following this architecture.  One example of this calculation can be found in Argonne National Labs report titled "TEST PROCEDURES AND BENCHMARKING Blended-Type and EV-Capable Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles."&lt;ref name=trans&gt;http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/HV/457.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This procedure uses the formula below to calculate an equivalent AER for vehicles that operate in blended mode:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{AER}_\text{Equivalent} = \left (1-\frac{GPM_{CD} }{GPM_{CS} }\right ) d^{CD}&lt;/math&gt;

Where GPM&lt;sub&gt;CD&lt;/sub&gt; designates efficiency in charge-depleting mode, and GPM&lt;sub&gt;CS&lt;/sub&gt; charge-sustaining mode as designated and ''d''&lt;sup&gt;CD&lt;/sup&gt; is distance in charge depleting mode.

A [[plug-in hybrid]]'s all-electric range is designated by PHEV-''(miles)'' or PHEV''(kilometers)''km representing the distance the vehicle can travel on battery power alone. For example, a PHEV-20 can travel 20&amp;nbsp;miles without using its internal combustion engine, or about 32&amp;nbsp;kilometers, so it may also be designated as PHEV32km.

==Observing and studying astrophysical plasma==
{{expand section|date=February 2018}}

Plasmas in stars can both generate and interact with [[magnetic fields]], resulting in a variety of dynamic astrophysical phenomena. These phenomena are sometimes observed in spectra due to the [[Zeeman effect]]. Other forms of astrophysical plasmas can be influenced by preexisting weak magnetic fields, whose interactions may only be determined directly by [[Astronomical polarimetry|polarimetry]] or other indirect methods.&lt;ref name="Lazarian2010" /&gt; In particular, the [[intergalactic medium]], the [[interstellar medium]], the [[interplanetary medium]] and [[solar wind]]s consist of diffuse plasmas.

Astrophysical plasma may also be studied in a variety of ways as they emit [[electromagnetic radiation]] across a wide range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Because astrophysical plasmas are generally hot, [[electron]]s in the plasmas are continually emitting [[X-ray]]s through the process called [[bremsstrahlung]]. This radiation may be detected with [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray telescopes]] located in the upper atmosphere or in space. Astrophysical plasmas also emit radio waves and gamma rays.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Possible related phenomena==

Scientists are interested in [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] because such astrophysical plasmas could be directly related to the plasmas studied in laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Lab experiments mimic the origin and growth of astrophysical magnetic fields|journal=Physics Today|volume=71|issue=4|pages=20-22|last=|first=|date=April 2018|doi = 10.1063/PT.3.3891|bibcode = 2018PhT....71d..20B|last1 = Berkowitz|first1 = Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these phenomena seemingly exhibit an array of complex [[magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic]] behaviors, such as [[turbulence]] and [[instability|instabilities]].&lt;ref name="MITNews2017" /&gt; Although these phenomena may occur on astronomical scales as large as the galactic core, many astrophysicists suggest that they do not significantly involve plasma effects but are caused by matter consumed by super massive black holes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In [[Big Bang]] [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the entire universe was in a plasma state prior to [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Afterwards, much of the universe [[reionization|reionized]] after the first [[quasar]]s formed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} 

Studying astrophysical plasmas is part of mainstream academic astrophysics. Though plasma processes are part of the standard cosmological model, current theories indicate that they might have only a minor role to play in forming the very largest structures, such as [[void (astronomy)|voids]], [[galaxy cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Early history==

Norwegian explorer and physicist [[Kristian Birkeland]] predicted that space is filled with [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. He wrote in 1913: {{quote|It seems to be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying electric [[ion]]s of all kinds. We have assumed that each [[stellar system]] through its evolution throws off electric corpuscles into space.}}Birkeland assumed that most of the mass in the universe should be found in "empty" space.&lt;ref name="NAPE"&gt;{{cite book |last=Birkeland|first=Kristian

In 1937, plasma physicist [[Hannes Alfvén]] argued that if plasma pervaded the universe, then it could generate a galactic magnetic field. During the 1940s and 1950s, Alfvén developed [[magnetohydrodynamics]] which enables plasmas to be modeled as waves in a fluid. Alfvén received the 1970 [[Nobel Prize]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|in Physics]] for this development. Alfvén later proposed this as the possible basis of [[plasma cosmology]], although this theory has faced scrutiny.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''Boron''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''B''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;5. Produced entirely by [[cosmic ray spallation]] and [[supernova]]e and not by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], it is a low-abundance element in the [[Solar system]] and in the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=17594|title = Q &amp; A: Where does the element Boron come from?| website=physics.illinois.edu|accessdate = 2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the [[borate mineral]]s. These are mined industrially as [[evaporite]]s, such as [[borax]] and [[kernite]]. The largest known boron deposits are in [[Turkey]], the largest producer of boron minerals.

Elemental boron is a [[metalloid]] that is found in small amounts in [[meteoroid]]s but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or other elements. Several [[allotropes of boron]] exist: [[amorphous]] boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]), and a poor [[electrical conductor]] at room temperature. The primary use of elemental boron is as [[boron filament]]s with applications similar to [[carbon fibers]] in some high-strength materials.

Boron is primarily used in chemical compounds. About half of all boron consumed globally is an additive in [[fiberglass]] for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in [[polymers]] and [[ceramic]]s in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials. [[Borosilicate glass]] is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. Boron as [[sodium perborate]] is used as a [[bleach]]. A small amount of boron is used as a [[dopant]] in [[semiconductor]]s, and [[reagents|reagent]] intermediates in the [[organic synthesis|synthesis of organic fine chemicals]]. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which ([[boron-10]]) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.

In biology, [[borate]]s have low toxicity in mammals (similar to [[table salt]]), but are more toxic to [[arthropod]]s and are used as [[insecticides]]. [[Boric acid]] is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/antibiotics1968/48/1/48_1_26/_article|title = The tartrolons, new boron-containing antibiotics from a myxobacterium, ''Sorangium cellulosum''|journal = The Journal of Antibiotics|volume = 48|issue = 1|pages = 26–30|pmid=7532644|vauthors=Irschik H, Schummer D, Gerth K, Höfle G, Reichenbach H |year = 1995|doi=10.7164/antibiotics.48.26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boron is an essential plant nutrient and boron compounds such as borax and [[boric acid]] are used as [[fertilizer]]s in [[agriculture]], although it only required in small amounts, with excess being toxic. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants. There is no consensus on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although there is some evidence it supports bone health.

==History==
The word ''boron'' was coined from ''[[borax]]'', the mineral from which it was isolated, by analogy with ''carbon'', which boron resembles chemically.
[[File:Sassolite.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|left|[[Sassolite]]]]

Borax, its mineral form then known as tincal, glazes were used in [[China]] from AD 300, and some crude borax reached the West, where the Perso-Arab alchemist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] apparently mentioned it in AD 700. [[Marco Polo]] brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in [[metallurgy]]. In 1777, [[boric acid]] was recognized in the hot springs ([[soffioni]]) near [[Florence]], Italy, and became known as ''sal sedativum'', with primarily medical uses. The rare mineral is called [[sassolite]], which is found at Sasso, [[Italy]]. Sasso was the main source of [[Europe]]an borax from 1827 to 1872, when [[United States|American]] sources replaced it.&lt;ref name=borates&gt;{{Cite book|pages=102; 385–386|title=Borates: handbook of deposits, processing, properties, and use| author = Garrett, Donald E.| publisher =Academic Press| date= 1998| isbn=978-0-12-276060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boron&gt;{{cite web| accessdate= 2009-05-05| url = http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/boron.htm| title = Boron|publisher=University of Denver|author=Calvert, J.

H. (1982) "Borax Pioneer: Francis Marion Smith." San Diego: Howell-North Books. p. 267 {{ISBN|0-8310-7148-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boron was not recognized as an element until it was isolated by Sir [[Humphry Davy]]&lt;ref name="Davy"/&gt; and by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Louis Jacques Thénard]].&lt;ref name="Lussac"/&gt; In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate on one of the electrodes. In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of [[electrolysis]]. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named the element ''boracium''.&lt;ref name="Davy" /&gt; Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. By oxidizing boron with air, they showed that boric acid is an oxidation product of boron.&lt;ref name="Lussac"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weeks"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Weeks|first = Mary Elvira|authorlink=Mary Elvira Weeks|date = 1933|title = The Discovery of the Elements|publisher = Journal of Chemical Education|location = Easton, PA|chapter = XII.

==Preparation of elemental boron in the laboratory==
The earliest routes to elemental boron involved the reduction of [[boric oxide]] with metals such as [[magnesium]] or [[aluminium]]. However, the product is almost always contaminated with [[boride]]s of those metals. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with [[hydrogen]] at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron for use in the semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of [[diborane]] at high temperatures and then further purified by the [[zone melting]] or [[Czochralski process]]es.&lt;ref name=berger&gt;{{Cite book| title = Semiconductor materials| author = Berger, L. I.|publisher = CRC Press| date = 1996| isbn = 978-0-8493-8912-2| pages = 37–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of boron compounds does not involve the formation of elemental boron, but exploits the convenient availability of borates.

===Chemistry of the element===
{{Category see also|Boron compounds}}
Elemental boron is rare and poorly studied because the pure material is extremely difficult to prepare. Most studies of "boron" involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon. The chemical behavior of boron resembles that of [[silicon]] more than [[aluminium]]. Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling [[hydrofluoric acid|hydrofluoric]] or [[hydrochloric acid]]. When finely divided, it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]], hot concentrated [[nitric acid]], hot [[sulfuric acid]] or hot mixture of sulfuric and [[chromic acid]]s.&lt;ref name="Laubengayer"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Boron. I. Preparation and Properties of Pure Crystalline Boron| doi =10.1021/ja01250a036|date =1943|first =A.

L.|issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of oxidation of boron depends on the crystallinity, particle size, purity and temperature. Boron does not react with air at room temperature, but at higher temperatures it burns to form [[boron trioxide]]:&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 814–864|isbn = 978-3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|last2=Wiberg|first2=Egon|last3=Wiberg|first3=Nils|chapter = Bor| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tetraborate-xtal-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|Ball-and-stick model of tetraborate anion, [B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, as it occurs in crystalline borax, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]·8H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Boron atoms are pink, with bridging oxygens in red, and four hydroxyl hydrogens in white. Note two borons are trigonally bonded sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with no formal charge, while the other two borons are tetrahedrally bonded sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, each carrying a formal charge of −1. The oxidation state of all borons is III. This mixture of boron coordination numbers and formal charges is characteristic of natural boron minerals.]]

Boron undergoes halogenation to give trihalides; for example,
:2 B + 3 Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
The trichloride in practice is usually made from the oxide.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

====Chemical compounds====
[[File:Boron-trifluoride-pi-bonding-2D.png|upright=0.5|thumb|[[Boron trifluoride|Boron (III) trifluoride]] structure, showing "empty" boron p orbital in pi-type [[coordinate covalent bond]]s]]
In the most familiar compounds, boron has the formal oxidation state III. These include oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and halides.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

The trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure. These compounds are [[Lewis acid]]s in that they readily form [[adduct]]s with electron-pair donors, which are called [[Lewis base]]s. For example, fluoride (F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[boron trifluoride]] (BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) combined to give the [[tetrafluoroborate]] anion, BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form [[boric acid]].&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

Boron is found in nature on Earth almost entirely as various oxides of B(III), often associated with other elements. More than one hundred [[borate mineral]]s contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral [[borax]], shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in borax.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt; The tourmaline group of borate-silicates is also a very important boron-bearing mineral group, and a number   of borosilicates are also known to exist naturally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindat.org&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Boranes}}

Boranes are chemical compounds of boron and hydrogen, with the generic formula of B&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;. These compounds do not occur in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form diborane, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt; are based on the fusion of two 10-atom clusters.

The most important boranes are diborane B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and two of its pyrolysis products, pentaborane B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; and decaborane B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;. A large number of anionic boron hydrides are known, e.g. [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.

The formal [[oxidation number]] in boranes is positive, and is based on the assumption that hydrogen is counted as −1 as in active metal hydrides. The mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the boron oxidation state is +3, but in decaborane B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;, it is &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; or +1.4. In these compounds the oxidation state of boron is often not a whole number.

{{Main|Boron nitride}}

The [[boron nitride]]s are notable for the variety of structures that they adopt. They exhibit structures analogous to various [[allotropes of carbon]], including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure, called cubic boron nitride (tradename [[Borazon]]), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds can be viewed as a [[coordinate covalent bond]], wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the [[Lewis base]] to a bond to the [[Lewis acid]]ic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively charged boron and negatively charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently, graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.&lt;ref name=dkg&gt;{{cite journal| title = Hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) – Applications from Metallurgy to Cosmetics| url = http://www.esk.com/uploads/tx_userjspresseveroeff/PR_0712_CFI_12-2007_Hexagonales-BN_e_01.pdf| author =Engler, M. | journal = Cfi/Ber.

=====Organoboron chemistry=====
{{Main|Organoboron chemistry}}
A large number of organoboron compounds are known and many are useful in [[organic synthesis]]. Many are produced from [[hydroboration–oxidation reaction|hydroboration]], which employs [[diborane]],  B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, a simple [[borane]] chemical. Organoboron(III) compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar, for example, [[tetraphenylborate]], [B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; vs. [[triphenylborane]], B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. However, multiple boron atoms reacting with each other have a tendency to form novel dodecahedral (12-sided) and icosahedral (20-sided) structures composed completely of boron atoms, or with varying numbers of carbon heteroatoms.

Organoboron chemicals have been employed in uses as diverse as [[boron carbide]] (see below), a complex very hard ceramic composed of boron-carbon cluster anions and cations, to [[carborane]]s, carbon-boron [[cluster chemistry]] compounds that can be halogenated to form reactive structures including [[carborane acid]], a [[superacid]]. As one example, carboranes form useful molecular moieties that add considerable amounts of boron to other biochemicals in order to synthesize boron-containing compounds for [[boron neutron capture therapy]] for cancer.

=====Compounds of B(I) and B(II)=====
Although these are not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable compounds with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in [[borane|boron hydrides]] and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, cannot be isolated in condensed form, but [[diboron tetrafluoride|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are well characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Magnesium-diboride-3D-balls.png|thumb|Ball-and-stick model of superconductor magnesium diboride. Boron atoms lie in hexagonal aromatic graphite-like layers, with a charge of −1 on each boron atom. Magnesium(II) ions lie between layers]]
Binary metal-boron compounds, the metal borides, contain boron in negative oxidation states. Illustrative is [[magnesium diboride]] (MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Each boron atom has a formal −1 charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of +2. In this material, the boron centers are trigonal planar with an extra double bond for each boron, forming sheets akin to the carbon in [[graphite]]. However, unlike hexagonal boron nitride, which lacks electrons in the plane of the covalent atoms, the delocalized electrons in magnesium diboride allow it to conduct electricity similar to isoelectronic graphite. In 2001, this material was found to be a high-temperature [[superconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Preparation and Structure of Magnesium Boride, MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|author = Jones, Morton E.|author2 = Marsh, Richard E.|last-author-amp = yes |journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume = 76 |issue = 5| pages = 1434–1436| date = 1954|doi = 10.1021/ja01634a089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1063/1.1570770|url = http://cmp.physics.iastate.edu/canfield/pub/pt0303.pdf|title = Magnesium Diboride: Better Late than Never|date = 2003|last1 = Canfield|first1 = Paul C.|last2 = Crabtree|first2 = George W.|journal = Physics Today|volume = 56|issue = 3|pages = 34–40|bibcode=2003PhT....56c..34C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain other metal borides find specialized applications as hard materials for cutting tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PvU-qbQJq7IC&amp;pg=PA638|chapter = Titanium Diboride|pages = 638–639|title = Materials handbook: A concise desktop reference|isbn = 978-1-84628-668-1|author = Cardarelli, François|date = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the boron in borides has fractional oxidation states, such as −1/3 in [[calcium hexaboride]] (CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).

From the structural perspective, the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the hydrides. Included in this series are the cluster compounds [[dodecaborate]] ({{chem|B|12|H|12|2-}}), [[decaborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;), and the [[carborane]]s such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Characteristically such compounds contain boron with coordination numbers greater than four.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of boron}}
Boron has two naturally occurring and stable [[isotope]]s, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B (80.1%) and &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B (19.9%). The mass difference results in a wide range of δ&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B and &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;B which decays through [[proton emission]] and [[alpha decay]]. It has a [[half-life]] of 3.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt; s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [[tetrahydroxyborate|[B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O phase changes in [[hydrothermal]] systems, and during [[hydrothermal alteration]] of [[rock (geology)|rock]]. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the [&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; [[ion]] onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and therefore may be responsible for the large &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B enrichment in seawater relative to both [[ocean]]ic crust and [[continent]]al crust; this difference may act as an [[isotopic signature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first = S.|last = Barth| title = Boron isotopic analysis of natural fresh and saline waters by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry| journal = Chemical Geology| volume = 143|date = 1997|pages = 255–261|doi = 10.1016/S0009-2541(97)00107-1| issue = 3–4|bibcode = 1997ChGeo.143..255B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exotic &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;B exhibits a [[nuclear halo]], i.e. its radius is appreciably larger than that predicted by the [[semi-empirical mass formula|liquid drop model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Two-body and three-body halo nuclei| first = Z.|last = Liu|journal = Science China Physics, Mechanics &amp; Astronomy| volume = 46| date= 2003| page = 441|doi = 10.1360/03yw0027| issue = 4|bibcode = 2003ScChG..46..441L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B isotope is useful for capturing [[thermal neutron]]s (see [[neutron cross section#Typical cross sections]]). The [[nuclear power|nuclear industry]] enriches natural boron to nearly pure &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B. The less-valuable by-product, depleted boron, is nearly pure &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B.

====Commercial isotope enrichment====
Because of its high neutron cross-section, boron-10 is often used to control fission in nuclear reactors as a neutron-capturing substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibliothek.fzk.de/zb/berichte/FZKA6746.pdf |title=Results of the B4C Control Rod Test QUENCH-07 |website=Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe in der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft |date=2004 |author=Steinbrück, Martin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719031833/http://bibliothek.fzk.de/zb/berichte/FZKA6746.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed; however, only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the [[dimethyl ether]] adduct of [[boron trifluoride]] (DME-BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and column chromatography of borates are being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://library.igcar.gov.in/html/Contents/IGCNewsletter/nl48/A2.htm|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081208114410/http://library.igcar.gov.in/html/Contents/IGCNewsletter/nl48/A2.htm|archivedate = 8 December 2008|title = Commissioning of Boron Enrichment Plant|publisher = Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research|accessdate = 2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1080/01496398608056140|title = Chromatographic Enrichment of 10B by Using Weak-Base Anion-Exchange Resin|date = 1986|last1 = Aida|first1 = Masao|last2 = Fujii|first2 = Yasuhiko|last3 = Okamoto|first3 = Makoto|journal = Separation Science and Technology|volume = 21|issue = 6|pages = 643–654}} showing an enrichment from 18% to above 94%.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enriched boron (boron-10)====
[[File:Neutroncrosssectionboron.png|right|upright=1.5|thumb|Neutron cross section of boron (top curve is for &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and bottom curve for &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B)]]

Enriched boron or &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B is used in both radiation shielding and is the primary nuclide used in [[neutron capture therapy of cancer]]. In the latter ("boron neutron capture therapy" or BNCT), a compound containing &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B is incorporated into a pharmaceutical which is selectively taken up by a malignant tumor and tissues near it. The patient is then treated with a beam of low energy neutrons at a relatively low neutron radiation dose. The neutrons, however, trigger energetic and short-range secondary [[alpha particle]] and lithium-7 heavy ion radiation that are products of the boron + neutron [[nuclear reaction]], and this ion radiation additionally bombards the tumor, especially from inside the tumor cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title =A Critical Assessment of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy: An Overview|journal = Journal of Neuro-Oncology|volume = 62|issue = 1|date = 2003|doi = 10.1023/A:1023262817500|pages = 1–5|first = Rolf F.|last = Barth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Radiation Research|pages = 1–18|volume =151| issue =1|date = 1999|title =The Radiation Biology of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy|first = Jeffrey A.|last = Coderre|doi = 10.2307/3579742|pmid = 9973079|last2 = Morris|first2 = G.

In nuclear reactors, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B is used for reactivity control and in [[scram|emergency shutdown systems]]. It can serve either function in the form of [[borosilicate]] [[control rods]] or as [[boric acid]]. In [[pressurized water reactor]]s, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as [[fissile]] material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.&lt;ref name=reactor&gt;{{Cite book|last = Duderstadt|first = James J.|last2= Hamilton|first2=Louis J.| title = Nuclear Reactor Analysis|publisher = Wiley-Interscience|date = 1976|isbn = 978-0-471-22363-4|page= 245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B has a theoretical role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN [[inorganic nanotube|nanotube]] material) which would also serve a special role in the radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with [[cosmic rays]], which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy [[spallation]] neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements, such as [[polyethylene]], but the moderated neutrons continue to be a radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li and &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Yu, J. | title = Isotopically Enriched 10BN Nanotubes| journal=Advanced Materials| volume =18|date =2006| url =http://www.rsphysse.anu.edu.au/nanotube/pdf/B10Nnanotubes.pdf | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080803192520/http://www.rsphysse.anu.edu.au/nanotube/pdf/B10Nnanotubes.pdf | archivedate =3 August 2008 |doi =10.1002/adma.200600231|pages= 2157–2160|last2= Chen|first2= Y.|last3= Elliman|first3= R.

====Depleted boron (boron-11)====

===== Radiation-hardened semiconductors =====
[[Cosmic radiation]] will produce secondary neutrons if it hits spacecraft structures. Those neutrons will be captured in &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B, if it is present in the spacecraft's [[semiconductor]]s, producing a [[gamma ray]], an [[alpha particle]], and a [[lithium]] ion. Those resultant decay products may then irradiate nearby semiconductor "chip" structures, causing data loss (bit flipping, or [[single event upset]]). In [[radiation-hardened]] semiconductor designs, one countermeasure is to use ''depleted boron'', which is greatly enriched in &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B and contains almost no &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B. This is useful because &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B is largely immune to radiation damage. Depleted boron is a byproduct of the [[nuclear power|nuclear industry]].&lt;ref name=reactor/&gt;

===== Proton-boron fusion =====
{{main | Proton-boron fusion }}
&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B is also a candidate as a fuel for [[aneutronic fusion]]. When struck by a proton with energy of about 500&amp;nbsp;k[[electronvolt|eV]], it produces three alpha particles and 8.7&amp;nbsp;MeV of energy. Most other fusion reactions involving hydrogen and helium produce penetrating neutron radiation, which weakens reactor structures and induces long-term radioactivity, thereby endangering operating personnel. However, the [[alpha particles]] from &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B fusion can be turned directly into electric power, and all radiation stops as soon as the reactor is turned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = W. M.|last = Nevins|title = A Review of Confinement Requirements for Advanced Fuels|journal = Journal of Fusion Energy|volume = 17|issue = 1|date = 1998|doi = 10.1023/A:1022513215080|pages = 25–32|bibcode = 1998JFuE...17...25N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NMR spectroscopy====
Both &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B possess [[nuclear spin]]. The nuclear spin of &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B is 3 and that of &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B is {{sfrac|3|2}}. These isotopes are, therefore, of use in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy; and spectrometers specially adapted to detecting the boron-11 nuclei are available commercially. The &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B nuclei also cause splitting in the [[resonances]] of attached nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Boron NMR| url = http://rmn.iqfr.csic.es/guide/eNMR/chem/B.html| accessdate= 2009-05-05|publisher = BRUKER Biospin| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090502140944/http://rmn.iqfr.csic.es/guide/eNMR/chem/B.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;| archivedate = 2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boron is rare in the Universe and solar system due to trace formation in the [[Big Bang]] and in stars. It is formed in minor amounts in [[cosmic ray spallation]] [[nucleosynthesis]] and may be found uncombined in [[cosmic dust]] and [[meteoroid]] materials.

In the high oxygen environment of Earth, boron is always found fully oxidized to borate. Boron does not appear on Earth in elemental form. Extremely small traces of elemental boron were detected in Lunar regolith&lt;ref&gt;Mokhov, A.V., Kartashov, P.M., Gornostaeva, T.A., Asadulin, A.A., Bogatikov, O.A., 2013: Complex nanospherulites of zinc oxide and native amorphous boron in the Lunar regolith from Mare Crisium. Doklady Earth Sciences 448(1) 61-63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mindat, http://www.mindat.org/min-43412.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Although boron is a relatively rare element in the Earth's crust, representing only 0.001% of the crust mass, it can be highly concentrated by the action of water, in which many borates are soluble.
It is found naturally combined in compounds such as [[borax]] and [[boric acid]] (sometimes found in [[volcano|volcanic]] spring waters). About a hundred [[borate minerals]] are known.

On September 5, 2017, scientists reported that the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]] detected boron, an essential ingredient for [[life]] on [[Earth]], on the planet [[Mars]]. Such a finding, along with previous discoveries that water may have been present on ancient Mars, further supports the possible early habitability of [[Gale (crater)|Gale Crater]] on Mars.&lt;ref name="GPL-20170905"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gasda, Patrick J. et al. |title=In situ detection of boron by ChemCam on Mars |date=September 5, 2017 |journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]] |volume=44 |issue=17 |pages=8739–8748 |doi=10.1002/2017GL074480 |bibcode=2017GeoRL..44.8739G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GZ-20170906"&gt;{{cite news |last=Paoletta |first=Rae |title=Curiosity Has Discovered Something That Raises More Questions About Life on Mars |url=https://gizmodo.com/curiosity-has-discovered-something-that-raises-more-que-1800879035 |date=September 6, 2017 |work=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=September 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Economically important sources of boron are the minerals [[colemanite]], rasorite ([[kernite]]), [[ulexite]] and [[tincal]]. Together these constitute 90% of mined boron-containing ore. The largest global borax deposits known, many still untapped, are in Central and Western [[Turkey]], including the provinces of [[Eskişehir]], [[Kütahya]] and [[Balıkesir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Kistler|first = R.

[[Turkey]] and the United States are the largest producers of boron products. Turkey produces about half of the global yearly demand, through [[Eti Mine Works]] ({{lang-tr|Eti Maden İşletmeleri}}) a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[state-owned company|state-owned]] [[mining industry|mining]] and [[chemical industry|chemicals]] company focusing on boron products. It holds a [[government monopoly]] on the mining of [[borate minerals]] in Turkey, which possesses 72% of the world's known deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Şebnem Önder|author2=Ayşe Eda Biçer|author3=Işıl Selen Denemeç|last-author-amp=yes|title=Are certain minerals still under state monopoly?|url=http://www.cakmak.av.tr/articles/Mining_Metals/Are%20Certain%20Minerals%20Still%20Under%20State%20Monopoly.pdf|accessdate=21 December 2013|newspaper=Mining Turkey|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it held a 47% [[market share|share]] of production of global borate minerals, ahead of its main competitor, [[Rio Tinto Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.easpd.eu/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/EVENTS/Conference2013/presentation_ayfer_atabey.pdf | title=Turkey as the global leader in boron export and production | publisher=European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabilities Annual Conference 2013 | accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost a quarter (23%) of global boron production comes from the single [[Rio Tinto Borax Mine]] (also known as the U.S. Borax Boron Mine) {{coord|35|2|34.447|N|117|40|45.412|W|type:landmark_globe:earth_region:US-CA|name=Rio Tinto Borax Mine|display=inline}} near [[Boron, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ludb.clui.org/ex/i/CA4982/ |title=U.S. Borax Boron Mine |website=The Center for Land Use Interpretation, Ludb.clui.org |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riotinto.com/ourproducts/218_our_companies_4438.asp |title=Boras |publisher=Rio Tinto |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=2013-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918084003/http://www.riotinto.com/ourproducts/218_our_companies_4438.asp |archivedate=18 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market trend===
The average cost of crystalline boron is $5/g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rareearth.org/boron_properties.htm |publisher = Los Alamos National Laboratory|title = Boron Properties|accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free boron is chiefly used in making boron fibers, where it is deposited by [[chemical vapor deposition]] on a [[tungsten]] core (see below). Boron fibers are used in lightweight composite applications, such as high strength tapes. This use is a very small fraction of total boron use. Boron is introduced into semiconductors as boron compounds, by ion implantation.

Estimated global consumption of boron (almost entirely as boron compounds) was about 4&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in 2012. Boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade.

The form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years. The use of ores like [[colemanite]] has declined following concerns over [[arsenic]] content. Consumers have moved toward the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content.

Increasing demand for boric acid has led a number of producers to invest in additional capacity. Turkey's state-owned [[Eti Mine Works]] opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at [[Emet]] in 2003. [[Rio Tinto Group]] increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006. Chinese boron producers have been unable to meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates. This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate ([[borax]]) growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28% per year over the same period.&lt;ref name=roskill&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Economics of Boron| edition = 11th| date = 2006| isbn = 978-0-86214-516-3| publisher = Roskill Information Services, Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ceramicindustry.com/Articles/Cover_Story/4b0b7a6ed1cb8010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____| accessdate = 2009-05-05| title = Raw and Manufactured Materials 2006 Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in global demand has been driven by high growth rates in [[glass fiber]], [[fiberglass]] and [[borosilicate]] glassware production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing fiberglass in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.&lt;ref name=roskill/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.roskill.com/reports/boron|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20031004160834/http://www.roskill.com/reports/boron|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2003-10-04|title = Roskill reports: boron|publisher = Roskill|accessdate = 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
{{see also|Boron deficiency (plant disorder)|Boron deficiency (medicine)}}
Nearly all boron ore extracted from the Earth is destined for refinement into [[boric acid]] and [[sodium tetraborate|sodium tetraborate pentahydrate]]. In the United States, 70% of the boron is used for the production of glass and ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/boron/| title = Boron: Statistics and Information| accessdate= 2009-05-05| publisher = USGS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{Cite book| author = Hammond, C.

The major global industrial-scale use of boron compounds (about 46% of end-use) is in production of [[glass fiber]] for boron-containing insulating and structural [[fiberglass]]es, especially in Asia. Boron is added to the glass as borax pentahydrate or boron oxide, to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etimineusa.com/en/applications-fiberglass-and-specialty-glass] Discussion of various types of boron addition to glass fibers in fiberglass. Retrieved August 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Another 10% of global boron production is for [[borosilicate glass]] as used in high strength glassware. About 15% of global boron is used in boron ceramics, including super-hard materials discussed below. Agriculture consumes 11% of global boron production, and bleaches and detergents about 6%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webstreetangels.com/MiningPresentations/0-940-Orhan-YILMAZ.pdf Global end use of boron in 2011].

Boron fibers and sub-millimeter sized crystalline boron springs are produced by [[laser]]-assisted [[chemical vapor deposition]]. Translation of the focused laser beam allows production of even complex helical structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties ([[elastic modulus]] 450&amp;nbsp;GPa, fracture strain 3.7%, fracture stress 17&amp;nbsp;GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in [[microelectromechanical systems|micromechanical systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Microfabrication of three-dimensional boron structures by laser chemical processing| journal = Journal of Applied Physics|volume = 72| pages = 5956–5963|date =1992| doi = 10.1063/1.351904|first = S.|last = Johansson| last2 = Schweitz| first2 = Jan-Åke| last3 = Westberg| first3 = Helena| last4 = Boman| first4 = Mats| issue = 12|bibcode = 1992JAP....72.5956J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boronated fiberglass ===
{{Main|Fiberglass}}
Fiberglass is a [[fiber reinforced plastic|fiber reinforced polymer]] made of [[plastic]] reinforced by [[glass fiber]]s, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase the strength of the glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of [[silica]], which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.

The highly boronated glasses used in fiberglass are E-glass (named for "Electrical" use, but now the most common fiberglass for general use). E-glass is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other common high-boron glasses include C-glass, an alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation, and D-glass, a [[borosilicate glass]], named for its low '''D'''ielectric constant).&lt;ref name=ullmann1&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all fiberglasses contain boron, but on a global scale, most of the fiberglass used does contain it. Because the ubiquitous use of fiberglass in construction and insulation, boron-containing fiberglasses consume half the global production of boron, and are the single largest commercial boron market.

===Borosilicate glass===

[[Borosilicate glass]], which is typically 12–15% B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 80% SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 2% Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, has a low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] giving it a good resistance to thermal shock. [[Schott AG]]'s "Duran" and [[Owens-Corning]]'s trademarked [[Pyrex]] are two major brand names for this glass, used both in [[laboratory glassware]] and in consumer [[cookware and bakeware]], chiefly for this resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Schott guide to glass| first = H.

Several boron compounds are known for their extreme hardness and toughness.
[[Boron carbide]] is a ceramic material which is obtained by decomposing B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with carbon in an electric furnace:
:2 B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 7 C → B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C + 6 CO

Boron carbide's structure is only approximately B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C, and it shows a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with [[empirical formula]] B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e., with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in [[vehicle armour|tank armor]], [[bulletproof vest]]s, and numerous other structural applications.

Boron carbide's ability to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived [[radionuclide]]s (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, to increase its surface area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Alan W.|last = Weimer| title = Carbide, Nitride and Boride Materials Synthesis and Processing| isbn = 978-0-412-54060-8| date = 1997| publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall (London, New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boron carbide and cubic boron nitride powders are widely used as abrasives. [[Boron nitride]] is a material isoelectronic to [[carbon]]. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN is used as a high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name [[borazon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first = R. H.|last = Wentorf|title = Cubic form of boron nitride|journal = J. Chem. Phys. |volume = 26|date = 1957| page = 956| doi = 10.1063/1.1745964| issue = 4|bibcode = 1957JChPh..26..956W}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. [[Heterodiamond]] (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.

===Boron metal coatings===
Metal [[boride]]s are used for coating tools through [[chemical vapor deposition]] or [[physical vapor deposition]]. Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through [[ion implantation]] or [[ion beam deposition]], results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose. These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties to those of the bulk boride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Materials Science of Carbides, Nitrides and Borides| author = Gogotsi, Y. G.| author2 = Andrievski, R.A.| last-author-amp = yes| publisher = Springer| date = 1999| isbn = 978-0-7923-5707-0| pages = 270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[rhenium diboride]] can be produced at ambient pressures, but is rather expensive because of rhenium. The hardness of ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits considerable [[anisotropy]] because of its hexagonal layered structure. Its value is comparable to that of [[tungsten carbide]], [[silicon carbide]], [[titanium diboride]] or [[zirconium diboride]].&lt;ref name="qin"/&gt;
Similarly, AlMgB&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; + TiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composites possess high hardness and wear resistance and are used in either bulk form or as coatings for components exposed to high temperatures and wear loads.&lt;ref name="tib1"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.stam.2007.06.009|title = Preparation of titanium diboride TiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by spark plasma sintering at slow heating rate|date = 2007|last = Schmidt|first = Jürgen|journal = Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume = 8|pages = 376–382|last2 = Boehling|first2 = Marian|last3 = Burkhardt|first3 = Ulrich|last4 = Grin|first4 = Yuri|issue = 5|bibcode = 2007STAdM...8..376S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detergent formulations and bleaching agents===
Borax is used in various household laundry and cleaning products,&lt;ref&gt;{{HPD|136}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the "[[20 Mule Team Borax]]" laundry booster and "[[Boraxo]]" powdered hand soap. It is also present in some [[tooth bleaching]] formulas.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

[[Sodium perborate]] serves as a source of [[active oxygen]] in many [[detergent]]s, [[laundry detergent]]s, [[cleaning product]]s, and laundry [[bleach (chemical)|bleaches]]. However, despite its name, "Borateem" laundry bleach no longer contains any boron compounds, using [[sodium percarbonate]] instead as a bleaching agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1351/pac197439040547|title = Industrial applications of boron compounds|date = 1974|last1 = Thompson|first1 = R.|journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume = 39|issue = 4|page = 547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecticides===

===Semiconductors===
Boron is a useful [[dopant]] for such semiconductors as [[silicon]], [[germanium]], and [[silicon carbide]]. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a [[electron hole|hole]] resulting in [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its [[atomic diffusion]] at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), liquid (BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), or gaseous boron sources (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). However, after the 1970s, it was mostly replaced by [[ion implantation]], which relies mostly on BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a boron source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|pages = 51–54|title = Fundamentals of semiconductor manufacturing and process control|last = May|first = Gary S.|last2= Spanos|first2=Costas J.|publisher = John Wiley and Sons|date = 2006|isbn=978-0-471-78406-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boron trichloride gas is also an important chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for [[plasma etching]] of metals and their oxides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|pages = 39–60|title = Semiconductor industry: wafer fab exhaust management|first = J.

Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride-boron nitride films, and for [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] of [[diamond]] film with boron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|page =44| title=Materials for information technology: devices, interconnects and packaging| author = Zschech, Ehrenfried| author2 = Whelan, Caroline| author3 = Mikolajick, Thomas| last-author-amp = yes | publisher =Birkhäuser| date = 2005| isbn = 978-1-85233-941-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnets===
Boron is a component of [[neodymium magnet]]s (Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B), which are among the strongest type of permanent magnet. These magnets are found in a variety of electromechanical and electronic devices, such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) medical imaging systems, in compact and relatively small motors and [[actuator]]s.  As examples, computer HDDs (hard disk drives), CD (compact disk) and DVD (digital versatile disk) players rely on neodymium magnet motors to deliver intense rotary power in a remarkably compact package. In mobile phones 'Neo' magnets provide the magnetic field which allows tiny speakers to deliver appreciable audio power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|page=45|title=Permanent magnet materials and their application| first = Peter|last = Campbell| publisher =Cambridge University Press| date= 1996| isbn=978-0-521-56688-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shielding and neutron absorber in nuclear reactors===
Boron shielding is used as a control for [[nuclear reactor]]s, taking advantage of its high cross-section for neutron capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4GzRaq0rIEwC&amp;pg=PA660|pages = 660–661|title = Physics for Radiation Protection: A Handbook|isbn = 978-3-527-61880-4|author = Martin, James E|date = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pressurized water reactor]]s a variable concentration of boronic acid in the cooling water is used to compensate the variable reactivity of the fuel: when new rods are inserted the concentration of boronic acid is maximal, and then reduced during the lifetime.&lt;ref name="PastinaIsabey1999"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Pastina|first1=B.|last2=Isabey|first2=J. |last3=Hickel|first3=B.|title=The influence of water chemistry on the radiolysis of the primary coolant water in pressurized water reactors |journal=Journal of Nuclear Materials|volume=264|issue=3|year=1999|pages=309–318 |issn=0022-3115|doi=10.1016/S0022-3115(98)00494-2 |bibcode=1999JNuM..264..309P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological role==
{{see also|Boron deficiency (plant disorder)}}
Boron is an essential plant [[nutrient]], required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]] lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8&amp;nbsp;ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8&amp;nbsp;ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0&amp;nbsp;ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://info.ag.uidaho.edu/Resources/PDFs/CIS1085.pdf|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091001005107/http://info.ag.uidaho.edu/Resources/PDFs/CIS1085.pdf|archivedate = 1 October 2009| publisher = University of Idaho| title = Essential Plant Micronutrients.

The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that boron is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. Adult dietary intake is estimated at 0.9 to 1.4&amp;nbsp;mg/day, with about 90% absorbed. What is absorbed is mostly excreted in urine. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level for adults is 20&amp;nbsp;mg/day.&lt;ref&gt;Boron.

Elemental boron, [[boron trioxide|boron oxide]], [[boric acid]], borates, and many [[organoboron chemistry|organoboron compounds]] are relatively nontoxic to humans and animals (with toxicity similar to that of table salt). The [[median lethal dose|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6&amp;nbsp;g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; above 2&amp;nbsp;g are considered nontoxic. An intake of 4&amp;nbsp;g/day of boric acid was reported without incident, but more than this is considered toxic in more than a few doses. Intakes of more than 0.5&amp;nbsp;grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1004276311956|date=1997|last1=Nielsen|first1=Forrest H.|journal=Plant and Soil|volume=193|issue=2|pages=199–208|title=Boron in human and animal nutrition|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=45215&amp;content=PDF|access-date=29 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922111524/https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=45215&amp;content=PDF|archive-date=22 September 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dietary supplementation of boron may be helpful for bone growth, wound healing, and antioxidant activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Nothing boring about boron | journal=Integrative Medicine | volume=14 | issue=4 | pages=35–48 | last1=Pizzorno | first1=L | pmid=26770156 | pmc=4712861 | date=Aug 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Single medical doses of 20&amp;nbsp;g of [[boric acid]] for [[neutron capture therapy]] have been used without undue toxicity.

Boric acid is more toxic to insects than to mammals, and is routinely used as an insecticide.&lt;ref name="Klotz 1994 1534–1536"/&gt;

The [[boranes]] (boron hydrogen compounds) and similar gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, it is not an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but their toxicity depends on structure.&lt;ref name="borates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boron"/&gt; The boranes are also highly flammable and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc204.htm|title = Environmental Health Criteria 204: Boron|date = 1998| publisher = the [[International Programme on Chemical Safety|IPCS]]| accessdate= 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis describes a feedback loop that begins with an increase in the available [[energy]] from the sun acting to increase the growth rates of phytoplankton by either a [[Q10 (temperature coefficient)|physiological effect]] (due to elevated temperature) or enhanced [[photosynthesis]] (due to increased [[irradiance]]).  Certain phytoplankton, such as [[coccolithophore|coccolithophorids]], synthesise [[dimethylsulfoniopropionate]] (DMSP), and their enhanced growth increases the production of this [[osmolyte]].  In turn, this leads to an increase in the concentration of its breakdown product, [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS), first in seawater, and then in the atmosphere.  DMS is [[oxidation|oxidised]] in the atmosphere to form [[sulfur dioxide]], and this leads to the production of [[sulfate aerosols]].  These aerosols act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and increase cloud droplet number, which in turn elevate the liquid water content of clouds and cloud area.  This acts to increase [[cloud albedo]], leading to greater [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] of incident [[sunlight]], and a decrease in the forcing that initiated this chain of events.  The figure to the right shows a summarising [[schematic|schematic diagram]].  Note that the feedback loop can operate in the reverse direction, such that a decline in solar energy leads to reduced cloud cover and thus to an increase in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface.

A significant feature of the chain of interactions described above is that it creates a negative feedback loop, whereby a change to the climate system (increased/decreased solar input) is ultimately counteracted and [[damping|damped]] by the loop.  As such, the CLAW hypothesis posits an example of planetary-scale [[homeostasis]] or [[complex adaptive system]], consistent with the [[Gaia hypothesis]] framed by one of the original authors of the CLAW hypothesis, James Lovelock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Some subsequent studies of the CLAW hypothesis have uncovered evidence to support its mechanism,&lt;ref name="andreae95"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2004GB002436 |author=Cropp, R.A., Gabric, A.J., McTainsh, G.H., Braddock, R.D. and Tindale, N. |title=Coupling between ocean biota and atmospheric aerosols: Dust, dimethylsulphide, or artifact? |journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=GB4002 |year=2005 |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2005/2004GB002436.shtml |bibcode=2005GBioC..19.4002C}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is not unequivocal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2006GB002787 |author=Vallina, S.

==Anti-CLAW hypothesis==
[[File:CLAW hypothesis graphic 2 AYool.png|thumb|200px|right|Schematic diagram of the anti-CLAW hypothesis (Lovelock, 2006)&lt;ref name="lovelock06"/&gt;]]

In his 2006 book ''[[The Revenge of Gaia]]'', Lovelock proposed that instead of providing negative feedback in the climate system, the components of the CLAW hypothesis may act to create a [[positive feedback|positive feedback loop]].&lt;ref name="lovelock06"&gt;{{cite book | author=Lovelock, James | title=[[The Revenge of Gaia]] | publisher=Penguin | year=2007 | isbn=0-14-102597-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under future [[global warming]], increasing temperature may [[Stratification (water)|stratify]] the [[world ocean]], decreasing the supply of nutrients from the deep ocean to its [[primary production|productive]] [[euphotic zone]]. Consequently, phytoplankton activity will decline with a concomitant fall in the production of DMS. In a reverse of the CLAW hypothesis, this decline in DMS production will lead to a decrease in cloud condensation nuclei and a fall in cloud [[albedo]].  The consequence of this will be further climate warming which may lead to even less DMS production (and further climate warming). The figure to the right shows a summarising schematic diagram.

Evidence for the anti-CLAW hypothesis is constrained by similar uncertainties as those of the sulfur cycle feedback loop of the CLAW hypothesis.  However, researchers [[computer simulation|simulating]] future [[Primary production#Oceanic production|oceanic primary production]] have found evidence of declining production with increasing ocean stratification,&lt;ref name=cox00&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cox, P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3652">'''Carl G.  Cromwell''' (January 26, 1889 - September 27, 1931) was a [[Texas]] [[Driller (oil)|Oil Driller]] and [[Aviation]] Pioneer.&lt;ref&gt;''Oil and Texas: A Cultural History'' (The Texas State Historical Association)  [https://texasalmanac.com/topics/business/oil-and-texas-cultural-history]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Carl G. Cromwell was born the oldest of six children to [[Swedish people|Swedish]] immigrants John Nels Cromwell and Hannah Anderson, in [[Saybrook, Pennsylvania]]. Cromwell took an oilfield job at age sixteen. He worked in [[oil fields]] in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Illinois]], and [[Oklahoma]], developing into a  knowledgeable driller. After service with the 358th Infantry at Camp Travis in [[San Antonio, Texas]], during [[World War I]], he married Luella Lundsford in 1919. They moved to Texas, where Cromwell drilled around [[Burkburnett]] and other Texas oilfields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fcr45 ''The Handbook of Texas'' (Texas State Historical Association)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1921, Texon Oil and Land Company contracted with Cromwell to drill in [[Reagan County]] on land owned by the [[University of Texas]]. On May 28, 1923, the Santa Rita No. 1 came in and produced great wealth for the University of Texas.  Cromwell became drilling superintendent of the Texon Company's expanding field around the camp of Santa Rita. In December 1928, the Reagan County discovery well came in at 8,525 feet. At that time the Santa Rita University 1-B was the world's deepest well.&lt;ref&gt;''Today in Texas History: Carl G. Cromwell drills world's deepest oil well'' [http://blogs.chron.com/txpotomac/2008/12/today_in_texas_history_carl_g.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petroleummuseum.org/PDF/Cromwell.pdf ''Carl G.

Cromwell was also an aviation pioneer. On November 1, 1929, he inaugurated Cromwell Airlines, an airline service between [[San Angelo]] and [[Dallas]], [[Fort Worth]], and [[San Antonio]]. While on a business trip in 1931, he was killed in an automobile accident near [[Sheffield, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cromwell Airlines (1840 - 1940'' (Public Transportation in San Angelo) [http://www.historicmuralsofsanangelo.org/transportation.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Carl G.

[[File:Carrefour de l'Arbre.PNG|thumb|right|location of the first half of Carrefour de l'Arbre cobbled road]]
[[File:1ère partie carefour de l'arbre.jpg|thumb|First stretches of Carrefour de l'Arbre.]]
'''Carrefour de l'Arbre''', officially '''Pavé de Luchin''', is a 2.1&amp;nbsp;km [[Sett (paving)|cobbled road]] in the municipalities of [[Camphin-en-Pévèle]], [[Baisieux|Baisieux-Sin]] and [[Gruson]], in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais|Nord department]] of Northern France. The location was the setting of the [[Battle of Bouvines]], which ended the [[Anglo-French War (1213–14)|Anglo-French War]] in 1214. Today, the road is best known from the cycling classic [[Paris–Roubaix]], where it has often proved decisive due to its proximity to Roubaix and cumulative difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paris (Compiègne) / Roubaix|url=http://www.letour.fr/2016/PRX/LIVE/fr/le_parcours.html|website=letour.fr|accessdate=14 October 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Carrefour de l'Arbre ''({{lang-en|Crossroads of the Tree}})'' is on open land between Gruson and Camphin-en-Pévèle. The road starts westward from Camphin-en-Pévèle along the ''Rue de Cysoing'' towards ''Camphin de l'Arbre''. The first half consists of a series of corners over highly irregular pavé towards Luchin. The second half starts after crossing an asphalt road and finishes at the ''Café de l'Arbre'' restaurant.

==Paris–Roubaix==
The road is one of three "five-star" pavé sectors of Paris–Roubaix, together with [[Mons-en-Pévèle]] and the [[Trouée d'Arenberg]]. It is considered one of the hardest passages of the race because of the bad state of the cobbles. As it comes at 15&amp;nbsp;km from the finish in [[Roubaix]] it is a pivotal location of the event and has often proved decisive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4365">[[File:Rapsfeld 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|Colza cultivation in Germany]]
'''Colza oil''' or '''colza''' is a [[non-drying oil]] obtained from the seeds of [[rapeseed]] (''Brassica napus'' subsp. ''napus''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_i8KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA204 ''Vegetable substances: materials of manufactures''], [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]], 1833, p. 204-205&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synonym (taxonomy)|syn.]] ''Brassica napus'' var. ''oleifera'' Delile, ''Brassica campestris'' subsp. ''napus'' (L.) Hook.f. &amp; T.Anderson.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Rapeseed#cite_note-grin-1|Ref. GRIN]]&lt;/ref&gt; Colza is extensively cultivated in [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[United States of America|United States]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]] and [[Poland]]. In France, especially, the extraction of the [[oil]] is an important industry. In commerce, colza is a traditional [[rapeseed oil]] (with turnip rape oil, sarson oil, toria oil (''[[Brassica rapa]]'' ssp.), and [[Sinapis arvensis|ravison]] oil),&lt;ref&gt;Jan Velíšek, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-IdyAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq="colza" ''The Chemistry of Food''], [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]], 2014, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; to which they are very closely allied in both source and properties. It is a comparatively nonodoriferous oil of a yellow colour, having a [[specific gravity]] varying between 0.912 and 0.920. The cake left after extraction of the oil is a valuable feed ingredient for [[pigs]].

==Uses==
Colza oil is extensively used as a [[lubricant]] for machinery.

Colza oil was used extensively in European domestic lighting before the advent of [[Coal gas|coal (city) gas]] or [[kerosene]]. It was the preferred oil for train pot lamps, and was used for lighting [[Passenger car (rail)|railway coaches]] in the [[United Kingdom]] before [[gas lighting]], and later [[electric lighting]], were adopted. Burned in a [[Carcel burner|Carcel lamp]], it was part of the definition of the French standard measure for [[lighting|illumination]], the [[carcel]], for most of the nineteenth century. In [[lighthouses]], for example in early [[Canada]], colza oil was used before the introduction of [[mineral oil]]. The colza oil was used with the [[Argand burner]] because it was cheaper than [[whale oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/eng/CCG/USQUE_Early_Lights |title=USQUE AD MARE - Early Lights - Canadian Coast Guard |publisher=Ccg-gcc.gc.ca |date=2008-03-31 |accessdate=2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colza was burned to a limited extent in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2001.05.0289%3Achapter%3D1.23 |first=John W. |last=Mallett |title=How the South got chemicals during the war |journal=Southern Historical Society Papers |volume=31 |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colza oil was used in Gombault's Caustic Balsam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racehorseherbal.com/Herbal_Therapies/Liniments/Gombaults/gombaults.html |title=Gombaults |publisher=Racehorseherbal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-14|quote=Note that the ingredients listed in this link are similar to, but not the same as, the list on the actual bottle.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a popular horse and human [[liniment]] at the turn of the 20th century. 

Among the more unusual applications of colza oil is the [[storm oil|calming of choppy seas]], where the oil modifies the [[surface tension]] of the water and rapidly smooths the surface.

'''Contact paper''' is an adhesive paper used as a covering or lining.

==Description==
Contact paper is an inexpensive material that has a decorative surface on one side and a highly [[adhesive]] material on the other side. The paper sticks to the desired surface with minimal effort. It is usually sold in roll form and the material is cut to size by the user. While its traditional use was as a shelf or [[Drawer (furniture)|drawer]] liner, it can be used in many creative ways. Teachers often use it for creative projects at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthskids.com/contactpaper.aspx |title=Contact Paper |publisher=Earthskids.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015124740/http://www.earthskids.com/contactpaper.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses of contact paper include use as laptop skins and protective book covers. &lt;ref name=contactpaperinfo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactpaper.info|title=Contact Paper Information|publisher=ContactPaper.info|date=|accessdate=2012-12-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301153427/http://www.contactpaper.info/|archivedate=2013-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Contact Paper== 
Contact paper is usually categorized by the kind of surface that it is supposed to stick to. Some of the types of contact paper include:&lt;ref name=contactpaperinfo/&gt;
* Adhesive Contact Paper
* Shelf Liner Contact Paper
* Stainless Steel Contact Paper
* Glass Contact Paper
* Vinyl Contact Paper

==Uses==
* Commonly used to line or cover kitchen and bathroom cabinets and drawers, counter tops, bookshelves, closet shelving, and pantry areas
* Covering up or protecting areas which have become (or could become) stained or ruined because of a project. Examples include art projects, foods and liquids, destructive substances
* The clear variety can be used for [[laminating]] books, art projects, posters, pictures, or other objects
* As part of a [[collage]]

==Application==
Most contact paper products feature an easy-to-peel liner and an adhesive that allows for repositioning of the material during installation. The material can be cut to size with scissors for custom applications depending on the requirement.

A '''crystallite''' is a small or even microscopic [[crystal]] which forms, for example, during the cooling of many materials. The  orientation of crystallites can be random with no preferred direction, called random texture, or directed, possibly due to growth and processing conditions. [[Texture (crystalline)#Thin film textures|Fiber texture]] is an example of the latter. Crystallites are also referred to as '''grains'''. The areas where crystallites meet are known as [[grain boundaries]]. Polycrystalline or multicrystalline materials, or polycrystals are solids that are composed of many crystallites of varying size and orientation. 

Most inorganic solids are polycrystalline, including all common [[metal]]s, many [[ceramic]]s, rocks, and ice. The extent to which a solid is crystalline ([[crystallinity]]) has important effects on its physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Purdue University [http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch13/category.php Categories of Solids]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sulfur]], while usually polycrystalline, may also occur in other [[allotropic]] forms with completely different properties.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2011.

Encyclopedia of Earth, eds. A.Jorgensen and C.J.Cleveland, National Council for Science and the environment, Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt; Although crystallites are referred to as grains, ''[[powder]] grains'' are different, as they can be composed of smaller polycrystalline grains themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.iupac.org/goldbook/P04723.pdf Definition of polycrystalline graphite]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the structure of a ([[monocrystalline]]) [[crystal]] is highly ordered and its [[crystal lattice|lattice]] is continuous and unbroken, [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]] materials, such as glass and many polymers, are non-crystalline and do not display any structures as their constituents are not arranged in an ordered manner. Polycrystalline structures and [[paracrystalline]] phases are in between these two extremes.

Crystallite size is usually measured from X-ray diffraction patterns and grain size by other experimental techniques like transmission electron microscopy. Solid objects large enough to see and handle are rarely composed of a [[single crystal]], except for a few cases ([[gemstone|gems]], [[Monocrystalline silicon|silicon single crystals]] for the electronics industry, certain types of [[fiber]], single crystals of a [[nickel]]-based superalloy for [[turbojet]] engines, and some ice crystals which can exceed 0.5 meters in diameter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=J. R. Petit, R. Souchez, N. I. Barkov, V. Ya. Lipenkov, D. Raynaud, M. Stievenard, N. I. Vassiliev, V. Verbeke, and F. Vimeux|title=More Than 200&amp;nbsp;Meters of Lake Ice Above Subglacial Lake Vostok, Antarctica|journal=Science|date=10 December 1999|volume=286|issue=5447|pages=2138–41|doi=10.1126/science.286.5447.2138|pmid=10591641}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most materials are ''[[polycrystalline]]'', made of a large number of single crystals &amp;ndash; crystallites &amp;ndash; held together by thin layers of [[amorphous solid]]. The crystallite size can vary from a few nanometers to several millimeters.

[[Image:Bronze_bell_with_visible_material_structure.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Bronze]] bell with large crystallites on the inside.]]

If the individual crystallites are oriented completely at random, a large enough volume of polycrystalline material will be approximately [[isotropic]]. This property helps the simplifying assumptions of [[continuum mechanics]] to apply to real-world solids. However, most manufactured materials have some alignment to their crystallites, resulting in ''[[texture (crystalline)|texture]]'' that must be taken into account for accurate predictions of their behavior and characteristics. When the crystallites are mostly ordered with just some random spread of orientations, one has a [[mosaic crystal]].

Material [[fracture]]s can be either [[intergranular fracture|intergranular]] or a [[transgranular fracture]]. There is an ambiguity with powder grains: a powder grain can be made of several crystallites. Thus, the (powder) "grain size"  found by laser granulometry can be different from the "grain size" (rather, crystallite size) found by [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray diffraction]] (e.g. [[Scherrer equation|Scherrer]] method), by [[Microscopy|optical microscopy]] under polarised light, or by [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (backscattered electrons).

Coarse grained rocks are formed very slowly, while fine grained rocks are formed quickly, on geological time scales. If a rock forms very quickly, such as the solidification of [[lava]] ejected from a [[volcano]], there may be no crystals at all. This is how [[obsidian]] forms.

== Grain boundaries ==

{{Contradicts other|date=October 2008|1=Grain boundary}}

{{main|Grain boundary}}

Grain boundaries are interfaces where crystals of different orientations meet. A grain boundary is a single-phase interface, with crystals on each side of the boundary being identical except in orientation. The term "crystallite boundary" is sometimes, though rarely, used. Grain boundary areas contain those atoms that have been perturbed from their original lattice sites, [[dislocations]], and impurities that have migrated to the lower energy grain boundary.

Treating a grain boundary geometrically as an interface of a single crystal cut into two parts, one of which is rotated, we see that there are five variables required to define a grain boundary. The first two numbers come from the unit vector that specifies a rotation axis. The third number designates the angle of rotation of the grain. The final two numbers specify the plane of the grain boundary (or a unit vector that is normal to this plane).

Grain boundaries disrupt the motion of dislocations through a material. Dislocation propagation is impeded because of the stress field of the grain boundary defect region and the lack of slip planes and slip directions and overall alignment across the boundaries. Reducing grain size is therefore a common way to improve [[strength of materials|strength]], often without any sacrifice in [[toughness]] because the smaller grains create more obstacles per unit area of slip plane. This crystallite size-strength relationship is given by the [[Grain boundary strengthening|Hall-Petch relationship]]. The high [[surface energy|interfacial energy]] and relatively weak bonding in grain boundaries makes them preferred sites for the onset of [[corrosion]] and for the [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of new phases from the solid.

Grain boundary migration plays an important role in many of the mechanisms of [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]. Grain boundary migration occurs when a shear stress acts on the grain boundary plane and causes the grains to slide. This means that fine-grained materials actually have a poor resistance to creep relative to coarser grains, especially at high temperatures, because smaller grains contain more atoms in grain boundary sites. Grain boundaries also cause deformation in that they are sources and sinks of point defects. Voids in a material tend to gather in a grain boundary, and if this happens to a critical extent, the material could [[fracture]].

During grain boundary migration, the rate determining step depends on the angle between two adjacent grains. In a small angle dislocation boundary, the migration rate depends on vacancy diffusion between dislocations. In a high angle dislocation boundary, this depends on the atom transport by single atom jumps from the shrinking to the growing grains.&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Doherty et al., ''[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TXD-3S72M8R-1&amp;_user=499885&amp;_handle=V-WA-A-W-WA-MsSAYVA-UUW-U-AAVDWWZDBU-AAVVYUDCBU-DYYUUAVUV-WA-U&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_coverDate=11%2F15%2F1997&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=%23toc%235588%231997%23997619997%236130!&amp;_cdi=5588&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000024500&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=499885&amp;md5=908908c9ec3f6083c310018ef34b1832 Current issues in recrystallization: a review]'', Materials Science and Engineering A238 (1997), p. 222 ''(Access to the article for subscribers only)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Grain boundaries are generally only a few nanometers wide.  In common materials, crystallites are large enough that grain boundaries account for a small fraction of the material.  However, very small grain sizes are achievable.  In nanocrystalline solids, grain boundaries become a significant volume fraction of the material, with profound effects on such properties as [[diffusion]] and [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]].  In the limit of small crystallites, as the volume fraction of grain boundaries approaches 100%, the material ceases to have any crystalline character, and thus becomes an [[amorphous solid]].

Grain boundaries are also present in [[magnetic domains]] in magnetic materials. A computer hard disk, for example, is made of a hard [[ferromagnetic]] material that contains regions of atoms whose magnetic moments can be realigned by an inductive head. The magnetization varies from region to region, and the misalignment between these regions forms boundaries that are key to data storage. The inductive head measures the orientation of the magnetic moments of these domain regions and reads out either a “1” or “0”. These [[bit]]s are the data being read. Grain size is important in this technology because it limits the number of bits that can fit on one hard disk. The smaller the grain sizes, the more data that can be stored.

Because of the dangers of grain boundaries in certain materials such as [[superalloy]] turbine blades, great technological leaps were made to minimize as much as possible the effect of grain boundaries in the blades. The result was [[directional solidification]] processing in which grain boundaries were eliminated by producing columnar grain structures aligned parallel to the axis of the blade, since this is usually the direction of maximum tensile stress felt by a blade during its rotation in an airplane. The resulting turbine blades consisted of a single grain, improving reliability.

Generally, polycrystals cannot be [[superheating|superheated]]; they will melt promptly once they are brought to a high enough temperature.  This is because grain boundaries are amorphous, and serve as [[Nucleation|nucleation points]] for the liquid [[phase (matter)|phase]].  By contrast, if no solid nucleus is present as a liquid cools, it tends to become [[supercooling|supercooled]].  Since this is undesirable for mechanical materials, [[alloy]] designers often take steps against it.  See [[grain refinement]].

The '''Rashava-Deralok Dam''' is a [[gravity dam]] currently being constructed on the [[Great Zab River]] just upstream of the town of Deralok in [[Dohuk Governorate]], Kurdistan region of Iraq. For its primary purpose, the dam will support a 37.6 MW [[run-of-the-river]] [[hydroelectric]] power station. Construction on the dam began in November 2015 when Kurdish Prime Minister [[Nechirvan Barzani]] inaugurated the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loan Agreement No. IQ-P15, Deralok Hydropower Plant Construction Project|url=http://www.dgmarket.com/tenders/np-notice.do?noticeId=9304566|publisher=DG Markets|accessdate=20 April 2016|date=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM Barzani Opens Deralok Hydropower Project|url=http://www.iraq-businessnews.com/2015/11/23/pm-barzani-opens-deralok-hydropower-project/|accessdate=20 April 2016|publisher=Iraq Business News|date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/191120152|title=www.rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/191120152|website=www.rudaw.net|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US$129 million contract to build the dam and power station was awarded to a Boland Payeh-Farab Consortium.

'''''Dive!''''' is an American [[documentary film]] directed by Jeremy Seifert.

==Premise==
The film follows director Jeremy Seifert and his friends as they [[dumpster dive]] behind several grocery stores in the [[Los Angeles]] area to demonstrate the massive amount of food that is wasted each year in America. After showing that much of the food found in dumpsters is perfectly edible, Seifert confronts the managers of the stores to question why they don't donate more of it to local [[food bank]]s, especially in light of the 1996 Federal Bill [[Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act]], which protects them from liability for such donations. The legality and ethics of [[dumpster diving]] are discussed when the stores begin locking up their dumpsters. Finally, Seifert considers the [[waste]] created by individual consumers when they throw out food that is only partly bad or just past its [[shelf life|expiration date]].

==Release==
''Dive!'' premiered in October 2009 at the [[Gig Harbor Film Festival]], where it won the Audience Choice Award. It has gone on to win awards at many other film festivals, including Best Documentary at the [[DC Independent Film Festival]] and Best Film at the [[Dutch Environmental Film Festival]].

The '''down quark''' or '''d quark''' (symbol: d) is the second-lightest of all [[quark]]s, a type of [[elementary particle]], and a major constituent of [[matter]]. Together with the [[up quark]], it forms the [[neutron]]s (one up quark, two down quarks) and [[proton]]s (two up quarks, one down quark) of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]. It is part of the [[generation (physics)|first generation]] of matter, has an [[electric charge]] of −{{sfrac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;[[elementary charge|''e'']] and a [[Quark#Mass|bare mass]] of {{val|4.8|+0.5|-0.3|ul=MeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="PDG2013"/&gt; Like all [[quark]]s, the down quark is an [[elementary particle|elementary]] [[fermion]] with [[spin (physics)|spin]] [[spin-1/2|{{sfrac|1|2}}]], and experiences all four [[fundamental interaction]]s: [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], [[weak interaction]]s, and [[strong interaction]]s. The [[antiparticle]] of the down quark is the '''down antiquark''' (sometimes called ''antidown quark'' or simply ''antidown''), which differs from it only in that some of its properties have [[additive inverse|equal magnitude but opposite sign]].

Its existence (along with that of the [[up quark|up]] and [[strange quark]]s) was postulated in 1964 by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[George Zweig]] to explain the [[Eightfold Way (physics)|Eightfold Way]] classification scheme of [[hadron]]s. The down quark was first observed by experiments at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] in 1968.

[[File:Murray Gell-Mann at Lection.JPG|thumb|200px|Murray Gell-Mann]]
[[File:George Zweig.jpg|thumb|200px|George Zweig]]
In the beginnings of particle physics (first half of the 20th century), [[hadron]]s such as [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[pion]]s were thought to be [[elementary particle]]s. However, as new hadrons were discovered, the '[[particle zoo]]' grew from a few particles in the early 1930s and 1940s to several dozens of them in the 1950s. The relationships between each of them was unclear until 1961, when [[Murray Gell-Mann]]&lt;ref&gt;

==Mass==

Despite being extremely common, the [[Quark#Mass|bare mass]] of the down quark is not well determined, but probably lies between 4.5 and {{val|5.3|ul=MeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="PDG2013"/&gt; [[Lattice QCD]] calculations give a more precise value: {{val|4.79|0.16|ul=MeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name=lqcd&gt;{{cite web|last=Cho|first=Adrian|title=Mass of the Common Quark Finally Nailed Down|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/mass-of-the-common-quark-finally.html|publisher=Science Magazine|date=April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306065114/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/mass-of-the-common-quark-finally.html|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When found in [[meson]]s (particles made of one quark and one [[antiparticle|antiquark]]) or [[baryon]]s (particles made of three quarks), the 'effective mass' (or 'dressed' mass) of quarks [[Quark#Mass|becomes greater]] because of the [[Quantum chromodynamics binding energy|binding energy]] caused by the [[gluon|gluon field]] between quarks (see [[mass–energy equivalence]]). For example, the effective mass of down quarks in a proton is around {{val|330|ul=MeV/c2}}. Because the bare mass of down quarks is so small, it cannot be straightforwardly calculated because relativistic effects have to be taken into account. Due to strong force mediated by gluons in the gluon field, the quarks move at roughly 99.995% of the speed of light, leading to Lorentz factor of roughly 100. As a result, the combined rest mass of quarks is barely 1% of proton or neutron mass.

The '''EcoCute''' is an [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] electric [[heat pump]], [[water heating]] and supply system that uses heat extracted from the air to heat water for domestic, industrial and [[Commerce|commercial]] use. Instead of the more conventional [[ammonia]] or [[haloalkane]] [[gas]]es, EcoCute uses [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] [[carbon dioxide]] as a [[refrigerant]]. The technology offers a means of [[energy conservation]] and reduces the emission of [[greenhouse gas]].

== Etymology ==
The name of the EcoCute comes from the Japanese phrase {{nihongo||自然冷媒ヒートポンプ給湯機|Shizen Reibai Hīto Ponpu Kyūtō-ki}}, which literally means "natural refrigerant heat pump water heater".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eco'' is a contraction of either [[ecology]] or [[Economic system|economical]] and ''Cute'' is a near homonym to {{nihongo||給湯|kyūtō}}; literally “supply hot water.”&lt;ref name="CRIEPI-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://criepi.denken.or.jp/koko/ecocute/page1.html

|publisher=Central Research Institute of Electrical Power Industry
|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Modern chemical refrigeration techniques developed after the proposal of the [[Carnot cycle]] in 1824. [[Jacob Perkins]] invented an [[ice]]-making machine that used [[ether]] in 1843, and ''{{lang|fr|[[:fr:Edmond Carré|Edmond Carré]]}}'' built a [[refrigerator]] that used [[water]] and [[sulfuric acid]] in 1850. In Japan, [[Fusanosuke Kuhara]], founder of [[Hitachi, Ltd.]], made an [[air conditioner]] for his own home use using compressed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a refrigerant.

In 1930 [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] discovered dichlorodifluoromethane, a chlorinated fluorocarbon ([[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]) known as [[freon]]. CFCs rapidly replaced traditional refrigerant substances, including CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (which proved hard to compress for domestic use&lt;ref name=discoverCO2&gt;[http://www.shecco.com/about/history.php The rediscovery of {{CO2}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007040239/http://www.shecco.com/about/history.php |date=2007-10-07 }} SHECCO&lt;/ref&gt;), for use in [[heat pumps]] and [[refrigerators]]. But from the 1980s CFCs began to lose favor as refrigerant when their damaging effects on the [[ozone layer]] were discovered. Two alternative types of refrigerant, hydrofluorocarbons ([[Hydrofluorocarbon|HFCs]]) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons ([[Hydrochlorofluorocarbons#Development of alternatives for CFCs|HCFCs]]), also lost favour when they were identified as [[greenhouse gases]] (additionally, HCFCs were found to be more damaging to the ozone layer than originally thought).  The [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]], the [[Montreal Protocol]] and the [[Kyoto Protocol]] call for the complete abandonment of such refrigerants by 2030.

In 1989, amid international concern about the effects of [[chlorofluorocarbons]] and hydrochlorofluorocarbons on the ozone layer, scientist [[Gustav Lorentzen (scientist)|Gustav Lorentzen]] and [[SINTEF]] patented a method for using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a refrigerant in heating and cooling. Further research into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refrigeration was then conducted at [[Shecco]] (Sustainable Heating and Cooling with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], leading to increasing use of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refrigerant technology in Europe.&lt;ref name=discoverCO2 /&gt;

In 1993 the Japanese company [[Denso]], in collaboration with Gustav Lorentzen, developed an [[automobile]] air conditioner using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a refrigerant. They demonstrated the invention at the June 1998 International Institute of Refrigeration/Gustav Lorentzen Conference.&lt;ref Name=bloom&gt;[http://www.denso.co.jp/ja/csr/report/2004/pdf/pdf/07.pdf Technology of Car air conditioner blooms as EcoCute], Denso {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/cppd/Presentations/Inui%20Compact%20Vehicles.pdf Concerns and Solutions for {{CO2}} Air Conditioning Systemsfor Compact Vehicles], Denso Corporation, 15 April 2004, Mobile Air Conditioning Summit 2004, Washington, D.C&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthscape.org/r1/etf01/kon01.html Concerns of C02 Air Conditioning System for Compact Vehicles], Denso Corporation, "References: at bottom": Natural working fluids ’98 (IIR Gustav Lorentzen Conference on Natural Working Fluids, [[Oslo]], [[Norway]],1998&lt;/ref&gt; After the conference, CRIEPI ([[Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry]]) and TEPCO ([[The Tokyo Electric Power Company]]) approached Denso about developing a prototype air conditioner using natural refrigerant materials instead of freon. Together they produced 30 [[prototype]] EcoCute units for a year-long experimental installation at locations throughout [[Japan]], from the cold climate of [[Hokkaidō]] to hotter [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]]. After this successful [[feasibility study]], Denso obtained a patent to compress CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refrigerant for use in a heat pump from SINTEF in September 2000.&lt;ref name="J-Pat"&gt;[http://www.tokugikon.jp/gikonshi/236techno.pdf EcoCute], [[Japan Patent Office]] Society {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercial domestic EcoCute was marketed in Japan by Corona Corporation in May 2001, and several manufacturers sold 1.5 million units there by October, 2008.&lt;ref Name=bloom /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hptcj.or.jp/chikunetu_lib/topics/doc/ecocutepress_2008.pdf[Heat Pump &amp; Thermal Storage Technology Center of Japan&amp;#93;] {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corona.co.jp/news/news_040520.pdf Announcement], CORONA Corp.,  Japanese edition: [[:ja:コロナ (暖房器具)|コロナ]] {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Federation of Electric Power Companies|FEPC]] reported 2 million EcoCute units had been delivered by end of October 2009, with the equivalent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorption of 9400&amp;nbsp;km² of [[forest]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] 2009-11-12 13 ver.13S page8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features and demand ==
In Japan in 1998, water heating ({{nihongo| Kyuto |給湯|kyūtō}}) accounted for 33.8% of typical domestic energy consumption, with air conditioner and [[kerosene heater]] heating accounting for another 26.9% and cooling by air conditioner another 2.3%. Most of the remaining 37% was spent on electrical home appliances, a field where 21st century innovations in energy conservation began to make considerable energy savings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eccj.or.jp/databook/2000/22-2.html 2.2 (2) Yearly home energy consumption by usage category] The Energy Conservation Center, Japan (ECCJ) {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TEPCO-1"&gt;[http://www.tepco-switch.com/ecocute/what/index-j.html What is EcoCute][[TEPCO]] {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left hot water supply as the most difficult area for energy conservation, leaving a gap in the market for the EcoCute. By January 2005, 26 Japanese companies were producing more than 450 models of EcoCute machines, and sales of domestic units increased 130-150% each year between 2001 and 2005.&lt;ref name="J-Pat" /&gt;

Denso first introduced the EcoCute outside Japan at the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#2003 – COP 9, Milan, Italy|COP9]] [[Milan]], [[Italy]] on December 9, 2003. From 2007, Denso began concentrating on marketing the EcoCute in the [[European Union|EU]].&lt;ref name=discoverCO2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehpn.fiz-karlsruhe.de/en/aktuell/kat3/akt232.html EcoCute demand surges in Europe], European Heat pump network&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r744.com/article.view.php?Id=655 Heat pumps offer huge potential], [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] Conference&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the Japanese government incorporated the EcoCute into its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction program under the Kyoto Protocol, mandating the installation of 5.2 million units in commercial and domestic properties by 2010.&lt;ref name="CRIEPI-1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/ondanka/kakugi/050428keikaku_betu.pdf Page 16/24, {{CO2}} reduction plan, Popularlizing high efficiency hot water supply machine,] [[Kantei]] {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of EcoCute is approximately 500 thousand [[Japanese yen]] as of February - March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =Article of home use [[fuel cell]], cost comparison|publisher =Yomiuri Shimbun, page 10, Ver. 13S|date =2009-03-05 issue|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EcoCute machine basics ==
An EcoCute machine or system consists of a heat pump and [[hot water]] storage unit. The [[Seal (mechanical)|sealed]] components are serially connected with refrigerant CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas in [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]].{{clarify|date=December 2016}}
# At the first stage, a [[heat exchanger]] collects heat from the air outside to use as energy for the refrigerant. Air flow is usually obtained using a [[centrifugal fan]]; in cold areas with ambient temperatures around -20 to -25°C an [[:Wiktionary:auxiliary|auxiliary]] [[fan heater]] is attached.
# A [[gas compressor]] is used to heat the gas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refrigerant to around 100°C under pressure of 10[[mega-|M]][[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] via [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] compression. The carbon dioxide becomes a supercritical fluid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denso.co.jp/ja/csr/environment/story/no3/2par.html Section2. Seeking supercritical fluid of {{CO2}}] Denso {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://national.jp/sumai/hp/1mech/index.html EcoCute structure] [[Panasonic]] {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several types of compressors can be used, including dual layer cylindrical compressors, [[scroll compressor]]s, and dual stage [[Rotary screw compressor|rotary compressor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanyo.co.jp/giho/no76/pdf/7612.pdf Cooling System Composed with Rolling Piston Type 2-Stage {{CO2}} Compressor], [[Sanyo]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# At the second stage a heat exchanger transfers energy from the hot refrigerant into water to produce hot water. Water temperatures around 5°C and up are suitable at this stage.
# Finally, ejector&lt;ref name="J-Pat" /&gt; or expansion [[Valve#Types of valves|valves]] reduce pressure on the refrigerant, letting it cool via [[adiabatic expansion]] and revert to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas.

The EcoCute can derive two to five units of heat energy from ambient air for every unit of input electrical energy. It produces three to five units of hot water energy, resulting in reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions compared to water heating via electricity or [[natural gas]]. To produce 90°C hot water, an EcoCute consumes 66% less electricity than an electric water heater, and costs 80% less than heating water via natural gas in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denso.co.jp/ja/csr/environment/story/no3/6par.html Section 6, Denso's assumption], Denso {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, by reducing use of fossil fuels, the EcoCute results in more than 50% reductions in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions&lt;ref&gt;[http://criepi.denken.or.jp/jp/energy/substance/01.pdf Research and development of EcoCute] [[CRIEPI]] {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not considering upstream losses of input source energy, the EcoCute's [[Coefficient of performance|COP]] is 3.8 in industrial use, while electric power water heating is 1.0, and gas [[boiler]] is 0.88 including [[pilot light]] loss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itomic.co.jp/catalog/bre/ecocute/gaiyo/tokucho.html Feature of industrial use Ecocute], www.itomic.co.jp {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1485">'''Electron-hole droplets''' are a condensed phase of [[exciton]]s in [[semiconductor]]s. The droplets are formed at low temperatures and high exciton densities, the latter of which can be created with intense optical excitation or electronic excitation in a p-n junction.

==Discovery==

Evidence for electron-hole droplets was first observed by J. R. Haynes of Bell Labs in 1966,&lt;ref name=Haynes_66&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haynes|first=J. R.|title=Experimental observation of the excitonic molecule|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=17 October 1966|volume=17|issue=16|pages=860–862|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.17.860|bibcode = 1966PhRvL..17..860H }}&lt;/ref&gt; who observed a frequency shift in the spectrum radiated by silicon at low temperatures (~3 K). The shift was attributed to the recombination of a bound state of two [[exciton]]s (electron-hole pairs). V. M. Asnin and A. A. Rogachev discovered metallic conduction in germanium at low temperatures when the density of excitons exceeded the amount required to transition into a metallic state.&lt;ref name=Asnin_68&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asnin|first=V. M.|author2=A. A. Rogachev|title=Mott transition in the exciton system in germanium|journal=JETP Lett|date=20 June 1968|volume=7|issue=12|pages=360–362|url=http://www.jetpletters.ac.ru/ps/1698/article_25819.shtml|accessdate=13 March 2013|bibcode = 1968JETPL...7..360A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fantom2sits.jpg|thumb|270px|A two-seat open top Fantom.]]

'''Fantom''' is a Swedish [[velomobile]] with four wheels, two in the front and two in the rear. It has no front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], but has suspension in the rear.

Fantom was never sold as a finished product. Instead it was sold as a set of drawings. The drawings are not exact and should be used as a guide. [[Hobbex]] bought the rights to the drawings and have sold it continuously since the 1940s apart from a short break in the 1990s. Over 100,000 copies of the drawing were sold, but few appear to have been completed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In the 1980s the Fantom was rediscovered by [[Carl-Georg Rasmussen]] who built a redesigned version{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} called [[Leitra]].

Se-79, half-life of 327k years, is one of the [[long-lived fission products]].

[[Krypton-85]], half-life 10.76 years, is formed by the fission process with
a fission yield of about 0.3%. Only 20% of the '''fission products''' of mass 85 become &lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Kr itself; the rest passes through a short-lived [[nuclear isomer]] and then to stable &lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Rb. If irradiated reactor fuel is [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]], this radioactive [[krypton]] may be released into the air. This krypton release can be detected and used as a means of detecting clandestine nuclear reprocessing. Strictly speaking, the stage which is detected is the dissolution of [[used nuclear fuel]] in [[nitric acid]], as it is at this stage that the krypton and other fission gases like the more abundant [[xenon]] are released.

Increase of [[Nuclear fission|fission]] gases above a certain limit can lead to fuel pin swelling and even puncture, so that fission gas measurement after discharging the fuel from the reactor is most important to make burn-up calculations, to study the nature of fuel inside the reactor, behaviour with pin materials, for effective utilization of fuel and also reactor safety.

The [[strontium]] radioisotopes are very important as strontium is a [[calcium]] mimic which is incorporated in bone growth and therefore has a great ability to harm humans. On the other hand, this also allows &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr to be used in the open source [[radiotherapy]] of [[bone tumor]]s. This tends to be used in [[palliative]] care to reduce the pain due to secondary [[tumor]]s in the [[bone]]s.

[[Strontium-90]] is a strong [[beta decay|beta]] emitter with a [[half-life]] of 28.8 years. Its [[fission product yield]] decreases as the mass of the [[fissile]] nuclide increases. A map of &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr  contamination around [[Chernobyl]] has been published by the [[IAEA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub886_web/Chernobylmap2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yttrium-89 ==
{| 
|{{Iso2|89|Y |R}}||{{Iso2|90|Y |V}}||{{Iso2|91|Y |I}}
|}
The only stable [[yttrium]] isotope, &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Y, will be found with yield somewhat less than 1% in a fission product mixture which has been allowed to age for months or years, as the other isotopes have half-lives of 106.6 days or less.

&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr decays into &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y which is a beta emitter with a half-life of 2.67 days.
&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y is sometimes used for [[medical]] purposes and can be obtained either by the [[neutron activation]] of stable &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Y or by using a device similar to a [[technetium cow]].

== Zirconium-90 to 96 ==
{|
|{{Iso2|90|Zr|R}}||{{Iso1|91|Zr|R}}||{{Iso1|92|Zr|R}}||{{Iso1|[[Zr-93|93]]|Zr|Y}}||{{Iso1|94|Zr|R}}||{{Iso1|95|Zr|I}}||{{Iso1|96|Zr|O}}
|}
A significant amount of [[zirconium]] is formed by the fission process; some of this are short-lived radioactives (&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Zr and &lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;Zr which decay to [[molybdenum]]), while almost 10% of the fission products mixture after years of decay consists of five stable or nearly stable isotopes of zirconium plus [[Zirconium-93|&lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;Zr]] with a halflife of 1.53 million years which is one of the 7 major [[long-lived fission product]]s.

In [[PUREX]] plants the zirconium sometimes forms a [[third phase]] which can be a disturbance in the plant. The third phase is the term in solvent extraction given to a third layer (such as [[foam]] and/or emulsion) which forms from the two layers in the solvent extraction process. The zirconium forms the third phase by forming small particles which stabilise the [[emulsion]] which is the third phase.

== Niobium-95 ==
{|
|{{Iso1|95|Nb|I}}
|}
Niobium-95 with a halflife of 35 days is initially present as a fission product. The only stable isotope of [[niobium]] has mass number 93, and fission products of mass 93 become relatively stable zirconium-93 (half life 1.53 Ma).

== Molybdenum-95, 97, 98, 100 ==
{|
|{{Iso1|95|Mo|R}}|| ||{{Iso1|97|Mo|R}}||{{Iso1|98|Mo|R}}||{{Iso1|99|Mo|V}}||{{Iso1|100|Mo|O}}
|}
The fission product mixture contains significant amounts of [[molybdenum]].

== Technetium-99 ==
{{Long-lived fission products}}
{|
|{{Iso2|[[Tc-99|99]]|Tc|Y}}
|}
[[technetium-99|&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]], half-life 211k years, is produced at a yield of about 6% per fission; see also the main [[fission product]]s page.

== Ruthenium-101 to 106 ==
{|
|{{Iso1|101|Ru|R}}||{{Iso1|102|Ru|R}}||{{Iso1|103|Ru|I}}||{{Iso1|104|Ru|R}}||{{Iso1|105|Ru|V}}||{{Iso1|106|Ru|B}}
|}
Plenty of both stable [[ruthenium]] and radioactive ruthenium-103 is formed by the fission process. The ruthenium in [[PUREX raffinate]] can become oxidized to form [[ruthenium tetroxide]] which forms a purple vapour above the surface of the aqueous liquor. The ruthenium tetroxide is very similar to [[osmium tetroxide]], the ruthenium compound is a stronger oxidant which enables it to form deposits by reacting with other substances. In this way the ruthenium in a reprocessing plant is very mobile and can be found in odd places. Also at [[Chernobyl]] during the fire the ruthenium became volatile and behaved differently from many of the other metallic fission products. Some of the particles which were emitted by the fire were very rich in ruthenium.

In addition the ruthenium in PUREX [[raffinate]] forms a large number of [[nitrosyl]] complexes which makes the chemistry of the ruthenium very complex. The [[ligand]] exchange rate at ruthenium and [[rhodium]] tends to be long, hence it can take a long time for a ruthenium or rhodium compound to react.

It has been suggested that the ruthenium and palladium in PUREX raffinate should be used as a source of the metals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nea.fr/html/pt/docs/iem/jeju02/session2/SessionII-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kiae.ru/eng/inf/tex/t52.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhodium-103 ==
{|
|{{Iso2|103|Rh|R}}|| ||{{Iso2|105|Rh|V}}
|}
While less rhodium than ruthenium and palladium is formed (around 3.6% yield), the mixture of fission products still contains a significant amount of this metal. Due to the high prices of ruthenium, [[rhodium]] and palladium some work has been done on the separation of these metals to enable them to be used at a later date. Because of the possibility of the metals being contaminated by radioactive isotopes, metals are not suitable for making consumer products such as [[jewellery]] but this source of the metals could be used for [[catalyst]]s in industrial plants such as petrochemical plants.

Potential Applications of Fission Platinoids in Industry, Zdenek Kolarik, ''Platinum Metals Review'', 2005, '''49''', April (2).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/dynamic/&lt;/ref&gt;

A dire example of people being exposed to radiation from contaminated jewellery occurred in the United States where it is thought that the [[gold]] seeds which were used to contain [[radon]] were [[recycle]]d into jewellery. The gold did contain radioactive decay products of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/hpposters/goldjewelry.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Palladium-105 to 110 ==
{|
|{{Iso1|105|Pd|R}}||{{Iso1|106|Pd|R}}||{{Iso2|[[Pd-107|107]]|Pd|Y}}||{{Iso1|108|Pd|R}}||{{Iso1|109|Pd}}||{{Iso1|110|Pd|R}}
|}
A great deal of [[palladium]] forms during the fission process. In [[nuclear reprocessing]], not all of the fission palladium dissolves; also some palladium that dissolves at first comes out of solution later. Palladium-rich dissolver fines (particles) are often removed as they interfere with the solvent extraction process by stabilising the [[third phase]].

The fission palladium can separate during the process in which the [[PUREX raffinate]] is combined with [[glass]] and heated to form the final [[high level waste]] form. The palladium forms an [[alloy]] with the fission tellurium. This alloy can separate from the glass.

[[Isotopes of tellurium|Tellurium-128 and -130]] are essentially stable. They only decay by [[double beta decay]], with half lives &gt;10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; years.  They constitute the major fraction of natural occurring [[tellurium]] at 32 and 34% respectively.
[[Tellurium-132]] and its daughter &lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;[[Isotopes of iodine|I]] are important in the first few days after a criticality. It was responsible for a large fraction of the dose inflicted on workers at [[Chernobyl]] in the first week.

The [[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]] forming &lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;Te/&lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;I is: [[Tin-132]] (half-life 40 s) decaying to [[antimony-132]] (half-life 2.8 minutes) decaying to [[tellurium-132]] (half-life 3.2 days) decaying to [[iodine-132]] (half-life 2.3 hours) which decays to stable xenon-132.

The creation of [[tellurium-126]] is delayed by the long half-life (230 k years) of [[tin-126]].

|{{Iso1|127|I |R}}||{{Iso1|[[Iodine-129|129]]|I |Y}}||{{Iso1|[[Iodine-131|131]]|I|V}}

[[Iodine-131|&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I]], with a half-life of 8 days, is a hazard from [[nuclear fallout]] because iodine concentrates in the [[thyroid gland]]. See also [[Radiation effects from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster#Iodine-131]] and
[[Downwinders#Nevada]].

In common with &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr, &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I is used for the treatment of [[cancer]]. A small dose of &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I can be used in a thyroid function test while a large dose can be used to destroy the thyroid cancer. This treatment will also normally seek out and destroy any secondary [[tumor]] which arose from a thyroid cancer. Much of the energy from the [[Beta particle|beta]] emission from the &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I will be absorbed in the thyroid, while the [[gamma ray]]s are likely to be able to escape from the thyroid to irradiate other parts of the body.

Large amounts of &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I was released during an experiment named the [[Green Run]]&lt;ref&gt;{{web archive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508030806/http://archive.tri-cityherald.com/thyroid/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which fuel which had only been allowed to cool for a short time after irradiation was reprocessed in a plant which had no iodine scrubber in operation.

[[Iodine-129|&lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I]], with a half-life almost a billion times as long, is a [[long-lived fission product]].

[[Iodine-127|&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I]] is stable, the only one of the [[isotopes of iodine]] that is nonradioactive. It makes up only about {{frac|1|6}} of the iodine in spent fuel, with I-129 about {{frac|5|6}}.

In reactor fuel, the fission product [[xenon]] tends to migrate to form [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s in the fuel. As caesium 133, 135, and 137 are formed by the [[beta particle]] decay of the corresponding xenon isotopes, this causes the caesium to become physically separated from the bulk of the uranium oxide fuel.

Because &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe is a potent [[nuclear poison]] with a large [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]] for [[neutron]] absorption, the buildup of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe in the fuel inside a power reactor can lower the [[reactivity (nuclear)|reactivity]] greatly. If a power reactor is shut down or left running at a low power level, then large amounts of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe can build up through decay of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I. When the reactor is restarted or the low power level is increased significantly, &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe will be quickly consumed through [[neutron capture]] reactions and the reactivity of the core will increase. Under some circumstances, control systems may not be able to respond quickly enough to manage an abrupt reactivity increase as the built-up &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe burns off. It is thought that [[xenon poisoning]] was one of the factors which led to the power surge which damaged the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] reactor core.

|}
[[Caesium-137]] with a half-life of 30 years is the main [[medium-lived fission product]], along with Sr-90.
Cs-137 is the primary source of penetrating [[gamma radiation]] from spent fuel until 300 years or more after discharge.
It is the most significant radioisotope left in the area around [[Chernobyl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub886_web/Chernobylmap1.html IAEA map]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caesium-134]] is found in [[spent nuclear fuel]] but is not produced by [[nuclear weapon]] explosions, as it is only formed by [[neutron capture]] on stable Cs-133, which is only produced by [[beta decay]] of Xe-133 with a half-life of 3 days. Cs-134 has a half-life of 2 years and may be a major source of gamma radiation in the first few years after discharge.

[[Caesium-135]] is a [[long-lived fission product]] with much weaker radioactivity. [[Neutron capture]] inside the reactor diverts much of the [[xenon-135]] that would otherwise decay to Cs-135.

A lot of [[barium]] is formed by the fission process, a short lived barium isotope was confused with radium by some early workers. They were bombarding uranium with neutrons in an attempt to form a new element. But instead they caused fission which generated a large amount of radioactivity in the target. Because the chemistry of barium and radium the two elements could be coseparated by for instance a precipitation with [[sulfate]] anions. Because of this similarity of their chemistry the early workers thought that the very radioactive fraction which was separated into the "radium" fraction contained a new isotope of radium. Some of this early work was done by [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]].

A great deal of the lighter [[lanthanide]]s ([[lanthanum]], [[cerium]], [[neodymium]], and [[samarium]]) are formed as fission products. In [[Africa]] at [[Oklo]] where the [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] operated millions of years ago the isotopic mixture of neodymium is not the same as 'normal' neodymium, it has an isotope pattern very similar to the neodymium formed by fission.

In the aftermath of [[criticality accident]]s the level of &lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt;La is often used to determine the fission yield (in terms of the number of nuclei which underwent fission).

[[Samarium-149]] is the second most important [[neutron poison]] in nuclear reactor physics. [[Samarium-151]], produced at lower yields, is the third most abundant [[medium-lived fission product]] but emits only weak [[beta radiation]]. Both have high neutron absorption cross-sections, so that much of them produced in a reactor are later destroyed there by neutron absorption.

'''Fusion Energy Foundation''' (FEF) was an American non-profit [[think tank]] co-founded by [[Lyndon LaRouche]] in 1974 in New York. It promoted the construction of [[nuclear power plants]], research into [[fusion power]] and [[Particle beam weapon|beam weapon]]s and other causes. The FEF was called fusion's greatest private supporter. It was praised by scientists like [[John Clarke (physicist)|John Clarke]], who said that the fusion community owed it a "debt of gratitude". By 1980, its main publication, ''Fusion'', claimed 80,000 subscribers.

The FEF included notable scientists and others on its boards, along with LaRouche movement insiders in management positions. It published a popular magazine, ''Fusion'', and a more technical journal as well as books and pamphlets. It conducted seminars and its members testified at legislative hearings. It was known for soliciting subscriptions to their magazines in U.S. airports, where its confrontational methods resulted in conflicts with celebrities and the general public.

The FEF has been described by many writers{{Who|date=January 2014}} as a "[[Front organization|front]]" for the [[U.S. Labor Party]] and the [[LaRouche movement]]. By the mid-1980s, the FEF was being accused of fraudulent fundraising on behalf of other LaRouche entities. Federal prosecutors forced it into bankruptcy in 1986 to collect [[contempt of court]] fines, a decision that was later overturned when a federal bankruptcy court found that the government had acted "in bad faith".&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press wire, [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/28/us/case-against-larouche-groups-is-dismissed.html Case Against LaRouche Groups Is Dismissed], October 28, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Key personnel were convicted in 1988.

==Personnel==
According to an article in ''[[The Nation]]'', the Fusion Energy Foundation had physicists, corporate executives, and government planners on its board of advisors, many unaware of the foundations connection to the U.S. Labor Party, while the board of directors was filled with LaRouche movement regulars and some party outsiders.&lt;ref name=Donner&gt;{{harvnb|Donner|Rothenberg|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1983 report published by The Heritage Foundation said that the foundation briefly gained the confidence of respected scientists who lent their reputations to it but it warned that they risked their reputations by doing so.&lt;ref name=Copulos&gt;{{harvnb|Copulos|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyndon LaRouche was a co-founder and one of the three members of the foundation's board of directors. Steven Bardwell, a nuclear physicist, was another director.&lt;ref name=King1989/&gt; The Executive Director was Morris Levitt in the 1970s and Paul Gallagher in the 1980s. Michael Gelber was the Central New York regional representative. Dennis Speed was the regional coordinator for Boston and Harley Schlanger was the southern regional coordinator. Uwe Parpart Henke was the director of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|INSA|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Gilbertson was the director of nuclear engineering.&lt;ref name=Stoffer&gt;{{harvnb|Stoffer|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marsha Freeman was a representative of the FEF's International Press Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyerhoff|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles B. Stevens, a chemical engineer, authored scores of articles on fusion energy research and development for both the earlier publication,The Fusion Energy Foundation Newsletter, and its successor, Fusion.

[[Eric Lerner]] was director of physics in 1977. Other notable scientists who wrote for FEF publications and lectured under its auspices include [[Friedwardt Winterberg]], [[Krafft Arnold Ehricke]], and [[Winston H. Bostick]]. [[Melvin B. Gottlieb]] received an award from the FEF. [[Adolf Busemann]] also received an award at a special dinner.&lt;ref name=King1989&gt;{{harvnb|King|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==

===Nuclear energy===
In 1977, Executive Director Morris Levitt asserted that nuclear fusion power plants could be built by 1990 if the U.S. spent $50 to $100 billion on research.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|AP|1977a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he announced that there would be no United States in the 21st century if President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s ban on building [[breeder reactor]]s was maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|AP|1977b}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the fusion power program at [[Argonne National Laboratory]], Charles Baker, said in 1983 that the FEF was "overstating" the prospect of practical fusion power in the near future. "The judgment of the vast majority of the people actually working in fusion believe it will take substantially longer" than the few years predicted by the FEF, according to Baker.&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;{{harvnb|Hoffman|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, the Fusion Energy Foundation had close contacts with fusion researchers. They became a conduit for information between researchers who were sequestered in secret research. Even the head of fusion research for the Federal Government cooperated with the foundation. It was praised by scientists like [[John Clarke (physicist)|John Clarke]], who said that the fusion community owed it a "debt of gratitude".&lt;ref name=King1984/&gt;  However  the politicization of the foundation's journals and the LaRouche views printed in them repelled the scientists involved, according to ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;ref name=Donner/&gt;

The FEF received publicity in 1981 when it published a book explaining how to build a [[Teller–Ulam design|hydrogen bomb]] written by [[University of Nevada, Reno]], professor [[Friedwardt Winterberg]]. The publication came two years after a magazine, ''[[The Progressive]]'', had tried to print similar information but was prevented by an injunction that became the ''[[United States v. The Progressive]]''. The government dropped the case  after the information was published by the FEF. The author of the original article later learned that a diagram by Uwe Papert published in 1976 in a LaRouche publication contained two important details of the weapon's design that he had been wrong about.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morland|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[colonization of Mars]] is a major proposal of the LaRouche movement. Friedwardt Winterberg described how rocket engines incorporating fusion micro-explosions could provide enough acceleration to convey a large mass in a reasonable amount of time, a concept derived from [[Project Daedalus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winterberg|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent Commission of Inquiry===
In 1979 the Fusion Energy Foundation created the Independent Commission of Inquiry to investigate the [[Three Mile Island accident|accident at the Three Mile Island]] nuclear power plant. The commission's members included Morris Levitt, Jon Gilbertson, Charles Bonilia.&lt;ref name=Stoffer/&gt; The commission determined that the accident must have been caused by [[sabotage]] because no other explanation was possible. According to Gallagher, "New evidence is accumulating that sabotage very likely occurred".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Indiana Evening Gazette|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Herald'' newspaper of [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]], when asked by reporters for evidence Gilbertson said he had none.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|AP|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beam weapons===
According to ''Fusion'', two members of the FEF went to the [[Soviet Union]] to attend conference on "laser interaction" in December 1978.&lt;ref name=King1984/&gt;

In 1982 and 1983, members of the LaRouche movement met repeatedly with the director of defense programs for the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], Ray Pollock, while he was developing the basis for [[Ronald Reagan]]'s "Star Wars" program, officially called the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Philadelphia Daily News|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock eventually said in the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) that LaRouche is "a frightening kind of fellow". The FEF held a seminar on beam weapons in October 1983, at the [[Dirksen Senate Office Building]].&lt;ref name=King1984&gt;{{harvnb|King|Radosh|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Physical Society]], FEF members disrupted a 1986 a conference on SDI to which they were not invited, and only stopped after being threatened with police action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hafemeister|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Ronald Reagan]] announced SDI the LaRouche movement made claims for having been the originators of the proposal, which reportedly "concerned" some people in the administration and in Congress, but no correction was made by them.&lt;ref name=King1984/&gt; The FEF lobbied state legislatures and testified before congressional hearings on behalf of beam weapons.&lt;ref name=King1984/&gt; Steven Bardwell resigned from the board of advisors in early 1984, reportedly because of money questions and a belief that the organization was losing its independence by becoming too solicitous of the Reagan administration in general, and in particular the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], and the NSC.&lt;ref name=King1984/&gt;

===Other advocacy===
As with other LaRouche entities, representatives of the Fusion Energy Foundation gave testimony to a number of congressional hearings. In addition to addressing committees on energy matters, FEF representatives, including [[Eric Lerner]], also testified on matters such as the nomination of [[Cyrus Vance]] for [[Secretary of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vance|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FEF campaigned on behalf of [[Arthur Rudolph]], a [[NASA]] rocket scientist who was forced to leave the U.S. in 1982  following an investigation into his role in the [[Mittelwerk]] rocket factory in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=King1989/&gt;

Psychiatrist Ned Rosinsky spoke as a representative of the FEF at a Wisconsin state legislative hearing on criminal penalties for drug possession in 1977. He testified that "marijuana is a medically dangerous drug until proved otherwise", citing studies showing brain damage and a reduction in white blood cells caused by the habitual use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Daily Tribune|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the auspices of Pakdee Tanapura,&lt;ref name=King1989/&gt; a wealthy Thai landowner, the FEF and EIR held a seminar in 1983 on the proposed construction of the [[Thai Canal|Kra Canal]] across Thailand.&lt;ref name=Pasertsri&gt;{{harvnb|Pasertsri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their plan favored the use of nuclear explosions to speed excavation. A second seminar was held in 1984,&lt;ref name=Pasertsri/&gt; and in 1986 the FEF published a report by U.H. Von Papart on the feasibility and financing for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Von Papart|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conferences===
*May 2, 1978: "Conference on the Industrial Development of Southern Africa", held in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=King1989/&gt;
*October 1980: "A High Technology Policy for U.S. Reindustrialization", held in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reisner|1993|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1985: "Krafft Ehricke Memorial Conference", held in [[Reston, Virginia]]. Cosponsored by the [[Schiller Institute]].&lt;ref name=King1989/&gt;

==Fundraising==
The FEF has been described by many writers as a "[[Front organization|front]]" for the [[U.S. Labor Party]] and the [[LaRouche movement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marable|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lerman|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tourish|Wohlforth|2000|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berlet|1981|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[National Review]]'' article published in 1979, former member Gregory Rose said that the primary purpose of the Fusion Energy Foundation was raising money.&lt;ref name=Rose/&gt; Milton Copulous, director of energy studies for the [[Heritage Foundation]], called the FEF "a front the USLP uses to win the confidence of unsuspecting businessmen".&lt;ref name=Copulos/&gt; In 1981, the FEF reported $3.5 million of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gibson|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a representative in Toronto, Richard Sanders, FEF contributions gathered in Canada were sent to the United States to support the presidential campaigns of Lyndon LaRouche.&lt;ref name=Laver/&gt;  In 1983, an FEF spokesperson said that there was no financial link between the foundation and LaRouche's campaigns.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; Although the FEF denied any financial connection to LaRouche's  [[U.S. Labor Party]], the two organizations reportedly shared offices in New York City.&lt;ref name=Laver&gt;{{harvnb|Laver|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview with a former member presented as evidence in ''[[Lyndon LaRouche#1984: NBC lawsuit|LaRouche vs. NBC]]'' in 1984:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Money from the . . . profit-making organizations went into political campaigns and was not correctly reported. Money from the tax-exempt [FEF] was given to the political campaign, unbeknownst to the people who made the contributions. . . . Someone would contribute to the [FEF] because they believed in nuclear power and their contribution would turn up as a contribution for . . . [LaRouche's] presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=King&amp;Lynch&gt;{{harvnb|King|Lynch|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Barbara Mikulski]] filed a complaint with the [[Federal Election Commission]] asserting that the FEF was improperly raising funds for a LaRouche-affiliated candidate, Debra Freeman, in a 1982 congressional campaign. The FEF replied that the fundraising was done under contract to the Caucus Distributors, Inc. (CDI), another LaRouche enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richmond Times - Dispatch|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When FEF director Steven Bardwell resigned in 1984, he complained that funds raised by the FEF through subscriptions were being diverted to other LaRouche entities. According to Bardwell, LaRouche said that Bardwell's sense of obligation to subscribers was "misplaced", and that "whether or not they knew it, they had contributed money to support Lyndon LaRouche and his ideas". LaRouche reportedly also said that the most important expenditures were for his personal security, and other expenses had a lower priority.&lt;ref name=AP12-07-1988&gt;{{harvnb|AP|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1985, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) withdrew the FEF's status as a tax-deductible non-profit, [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|Section 501(c)(3)]], which it had had since 1978. The stated reason was that it had failed to file a tax return in the prior two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|SF Chronicle|1986a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1986, New York Attorney General [[Robert Abrams]] sued to dissolve the FEF, charging that it fraudulently solicited donations as tax-deductible after their exemption had been withdrawn, and for failure to file required forms. Paul Gallagher, described the suit as "part of an escalating witch hunt against FEF board member Lyndon LaRouche."&lt;ref name=Welch&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, the IRS restored the FEF's tax exempt status, saying it had made an error though privacy rules prevented further elaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|SF Chronicle|1986b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subscribers to ''Fusion'' complained that their credit cards were being billed for unauthorized charges. In one example a man who had subscribed to ''Fusion'' found that he had been billed for $1000, for which he received [[promissory note]]s in the mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ciolli|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors charged that the FEF and other LaRouche related groups had made improper charges to the credit cards of about 1,000 people.&lt;ref name="Roderick10/14/86"/&gt;

Fundraisers also solicited larger sums. A 71-year-old California woman loaned the FEF $100,000 after making smaller loans to other LaRouche-related entities. FEF fundraisers refused to take a check and drove her to the bank so she could wire the money directly. The FEF made no interest or principal payments on the loans. After she sued the FEF for repayment they settled, acknowledged the loans, and agreed to a schedule of payments. They stopped making payments after sending a few checks, one of which bounced.  She filed suit in Virginia in an attempt to attach FEF assets there.&lt;ref name=Welch/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ibykus Farm combined.jpg|thumb|alt=Photographs of the front and back of a large private home.|"Ibykus Farm", the estate purchased for LaRouche by a Fusion Energy Foundation supporter.]] --&gt;
In a widely reported case, a 79-year-old retired steel executive gave or loaned a total of $2.6 million over a 14 months period in amounts ranging from $250 to $350,000, according to a lawsuit. He said he was not a supporter of LaRouche political campaigns, and that he gave the money, "Because I got so many telephone calls requesting donations". He said "I'm mad at myself now" for having turned over the money, most of which went to the FEF. When he told the fundraisers that he only wanted to give money to his family in the future, he was reportedly told that gifts to the LaRouche movement "would be of greater benefit" to the family because LaRouche's supporters "were changing the world situation".&lt;ref name="NYT4/27/86"&gt;{{harvnb|AP|1986aa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FEF gave the donor a plaque which said, "Benjamin Franklin Award Honoring Special Contributions to the Future of Science".&lt;ref name="NYT4/27/86"/&gt; In a ''[[Nightline (U.S. news program)|Nightline]]'' interview, LaRouche called him "a person who's been associated with us as a supporter for a long time."&lt;ref name="NYT4/27/86"/&gt; LaRouche's treasurer, Edward Spannaus, said the "drug lobby" was responsible for accusations that the LaRouche movement had encouraged supporters to turn over their savings.&lt;ref name="NYT4/27/86"/&gt;

During a 1986 Virginia state investigation, an undercover policeman purchased subscriptions to ''Fusion'' and another LaRouche movement publication, ''[[Executive Intelligence Review]]'', at [[Washington National Airport]]. He then received 22 "abusive and demanding" telephone calls asking for loans or donations. He was told the money was needed to fight AIDS and to keep LaRouche out of jail.&lt;ref name="Roderick10/14/86"&gt;{{harvnb|Roderick|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he agreed to make a loan he received a letter of acknowledgement and an invitation to tour the LaRouche headquarters in [[Leesburg, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hardin|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all supporters contributed due to pressure. An Oklahoman oilman subscribed to ''Fusion'' and liked LaRouche's views on nuclear power. He donated thousands of dollars as well as buying a $900,000 estate for LaRouche's use, charging rent to cover the mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|AP|1986a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airports===
Supporters of the Fusion Energy Foundation became well known for their aggressive fundraising in U.S. airports in the late 1970s and early 1980s, along with [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]] and [[Moonie (Unification Church)|Moonies]]. They set up tables to sell publications from the FEF and other LaRouche organizations and displayed provocatively captioned, hand-lettered posters. The FEF members would shout slogans to passers-by to get attention, and sometimes accused those who disagreed with them of being homosexuals. One writer called them the "most obnoxious of the groups...infesting the airports."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greene|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An article in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called them "the kooks at the airport" who solicited money using posters often denouncing [[Jane Fonda]],&lt;ref name=Kaufman/&gt; a target of the LaRouche movement because of her support for environmental causes.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1983|pp=188–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FEF had slogans and bumper stickers with texts like:
*Beam the Bomb &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michaud|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*More nukes, less kooks &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lacitis|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Nuclear plants are built better than Jane Fonda &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bravin|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Nuke Jane Fonda &lt;ref name=Kaufman&gt;{{harvnb|Kaufman|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Feed Jane Fonda to the Whales &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hume|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Fonda's brother, actor [[Peter Fonda]] was enraged by a sign in Denver's [[Stapleton International Airport|Stapleton Airport]] that said, "Feed Jane Fonda to the Whales." He cut up the sign with his pocketknife. The FEF members pressed charges for destruction of property leading Fonda to miss his flight, though he was allowed to leave without posting bond. The case was dropped when the FEF members failed to appear on the court date.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

In 1982, Ellen Kaplan, an FEF member raising money in the [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]], spotted former [[Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] and his wife [[Nancy Kissinger|Nancy]]. Kissinger was flying to Boston for a heart operation. Kaplan went up to Kissinger and asked him why he had "prolonged the war in Vietnam", and then, "Mr. Kissinger, do you sleep with young boys at the Carlyle Hotel?" At that point Nancy Kissinger grabbed Kaplan by the throat and asked, "Do you want to get slugged?" Kaplan later explained that she was a "longtime opponent" of Kissinger, and that she "wanted to confront the man with how low he is." She pressed charges and Dennis Speed, an FEF coordinator, said they would make Kissinger into "a laughingstock".&lt;ref name=Mintz1985&gt;{{harvnb|Mintz|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Newark municipal judge acquitted Mrs. Kissinger, saying that she had exhibited "a reasonable spontaneous, somewhat human reaction" and that there was no injury.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

==Legal issues==
{{main|LaRouche criminal trials}}

In 1977, the Fusion Energy Foundation received a temporary injunction to prevent the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) from harassing it or interfering with its activities. The suit claimed that the FBI Director, [[Clarence M. Kelley]], had personally ordered FBI agents to disrupt FEF conferences and dissuade scientists from participating. The injunction also included U.S. Attorney General [[Griffin Bell]] and Secretary of Energy [[James R. Schlesinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UPI|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the FEF was ordered by a state court to stop raising funds in [[California]] due to complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seattle Times|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate action the same year, the FEF, along with other LaRouche entities, was named in a lawsuit charging violations of the Federal [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) that was filed in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Roderick10/19/86"&gt;{{harvnb|Roderick|Spiegel|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an unusual move, the assets of the FEF and related entities were seized before the suit was unsealed, because the plaintiff's lawyer convinced the judge that the entities would hide their assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|AP|1986c}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the FEF and five other LaRouche entities were prohibited from operating in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKelway|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the FEF was sued by the California Attorney General's office. The suit alleged that FEF fundraisers had flown down from [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] to take the 79-year old [[Laguna Hills, California|Laguna Hills]] resident to her bankbox where they got from her stock certificates worth $104,452, described by her accountant as the woman's life savings. In their place was a receipt signed by Paul Gallagher, Executive Director of the FEF. LaRouche said the charges were "totally frivolous" and the result of corruption in the Attorney General's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|LAT|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a federal grand jury investigation into fundraising practices in 1985, the FEF and other LaRouche entities were given subpoenas requiring that they turn over documents and provide a [[keeper of records]] to testify. They failed to surrender the documents and the keepers of records they sent were appointed the day before. When ordered to give the home address of FEF Executive Director Gallagher, the address turned out to be a vacant lot.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|AP|1986b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five months after the subpoenas were served, and after several hearings on the matter, U.S. District Judge [[A. David Mazzone]] found the FEF in contempt of court and levied a fine of $10,000 per day to enforce the subpoena starting in March 1986. Similar fines were placed on other LaRouche organizations, totalling $45,000 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FEF and the other LaRouche entities appealed the fines repeatedly, and were denied each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|795 F.2d 226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|871 F.2d 156}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to review the lower court decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Providence Journal|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1986, hundreds of federal and state law enforcement conducted a coordinated raid on the offices of LaRouche enterprises, including those of the FEF, and seized the documents that had been subpoenaed in 1985. The FEF and other entities argued in court that the search warrants had been improperly executed, and that documents were taken in violation of their [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights. The Court of Appeals denied their appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|836 F.2d 1342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|848 F.2d 184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months later, in April 1987, the federal prosecutors obtained an unusual involuntary bankruptcy procedure against the FEF and other groups in order to settle the contempt of court fines which had grown to $21.4 million. The government claimed that the LaRouche groups were selling properties in order to hide the cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jackson|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was granted by Judge [[Martin V.B. Bostetter]] and the federal government seized the property of the FEF and other groups. Reportedly, they only recovered $86,000 in assets.&lt;ref name="McKelway1988"&gt;{{Harvnb|McKelway|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1989, the FEF's bankruptcy petition was reviewed by Judge Bostetter who dismissed it, effectively reversing his April 1987 ruling. He noted that two of the entities, including FEF, were nonprofit fund-raisers and therefore ineligible for involuntary bankruptcy actions. He found that the government's actions and representations in obtaining the bankruptcy had the effect of misleading the court as to the status of the organization.&lt;ref name="Howe1989"&gt;{{harvnb|Howe|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the scientific and fusion community noted the closing of the FEF publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gellerman|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full page advertisement protesting the closures, published in ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'', was signed by people associated with the fusion and SDI fields, including 22 employees of the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=King1989/&gt;

==Publications==

===''International Journal of Fusion Energy''===
The ''International Journal of Fusion Energy'' was published intermittently from March 1977 to October 1985, putting out at least 11 issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wlym.com/~basement/fusion/fusionarchive_ijfe.html |archivedate=January 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vsKGIt7I?url=http://wlym.com/~basement/fusion/fusionarchive_ijfe.html |title=International Journal of Fusion Energy |publisher=FUSION ARCHIVE |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For some time [[Robert James Moon]] acted as editor-in-chief.

===''Fusion Magazine''===
Morris Levitt was the editor-in-chief as of 1979, but by the mid-1980s the job was taken over by Steven Bardwell, and by 1986 it was Carol White. Marjorie Mazel Hecht was the managing editor. By 1980, it claimed 80,000 subscribers.&lt;ref name=King1984/&gt;

===''21st Century Science and Technology''===

''21st Century Science and Technology'' is a quarterly magazine established in 1988 following the federal government's closing down of its predecessor ''Fusion Magazine'' (1977 to 1987). It has the same editor and material as ''Fusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last hard copy issue of the magazine published was the Winter 2005-2006 issue. Subsequent issues are available in electronic [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format only. The magazine deals with a variety of issues, including criticism of claims of [[Global warming|anthropogenic global warming]], promotion of the use of [[DDT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and support for an alternative to the standard [[atomic theory]], based on the "Moon model" of [[Robert James Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hecht|Stevens|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable writers include: [[J. Gordon Edwards (entomologist and mountaineer)|J. Gordon Edwards]], [[Zbigniew Jaworowski]] and [[Paul Marmet]]. According to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and other sources, it is published by supporters of Lyndon LaRouche.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beder|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Global storm activity of 2008''' profiles the major worldwide storms, including blizzards, ice storms, and other winter events, from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008. A [[winter storm]] is an event in which the dominant varieties of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are forms that only occur at cold temperatures, such as snow or [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]], or a rainstorm where ground temperatures are cold enough to allow [[ice]] to form (i.e. [[freezing rain]]). It may be marked by strong wind, [[thunder]] and [[lightning]] (a [[thunderstorm]]), heavy [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], such as [[ice]] ([[winter storm|ice storm]]), or wind transporting some substance through the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] (as in a [[dust storm]], [[snowstorm]], [[hail]]storm, etc.). Major [[dust storms]], [[Hurricane]]s, [[cyclone]]s, [[tornado]]s, [[gale]]s, [[flooding]] and [[rainstorm]]s are also caused by such phenomena to a lesser or greater existent.

A '''storm''' (from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*sturmaz'' "noise, tumult") is any disturbed state of an astronomical body's [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]], especially affecting its surface, and strongly implying [[severe weather]]. It may be marked by strong wind, [[thunder]] and [[lightning]] (a [[thunderstorm]]), heavy [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], such as [[ice]] ([[winter storm|ice storm]]), or wind transporting some substance through the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] (as in a [[dust storm]], [[snowstorm]], [[hail]]storm, etc.).

Storms are created when a centre of [[Low pressure area|low pressure]] develops, with a system of [[high pressure area|high pressure]] surrounding it. This combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm [[clouds]], such as the [[cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]]. Small, localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground, resulting in smaller [[meteorological]] disturbances such as [[dust devils]] and [[whirlwinds]].

==Events of 2008==

===January===

====December 30 – January 2====

[[Image:Winter Storm December 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|Winter Storm in New York (December 2007)]]
A series of moderate to intense low pressure systems affected most of eastern North America particularly the Canadian Maritimes with repeated heavy snow, mixed precipitation, rain and wind. The initial storm dumped over a foot of snow over parts of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] on December 30&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/30/canada-storm.html Atlantic Canada braces for New Year's Eve storm], ''CBC'', December 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; while a second storm gave a foot of snow over [[Prince Edward Island]] and several inches of snow across [[New Brunswick]] and portions of [[New England]] and [[Ontario]] on December 30–31 while Nova Scotia received a mix of snow, rain and ice pellets. Several New Year's Eve festivities including [[Charlottetown]]'s main event as well as the fireworks show in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] were cancelled due to weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/31/atlantic-storm.html New year brings storm to Eastern Canada; festivities go on in other regions], ''CBC'', January 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/01/01/atlantic-storm.html New year, new snow to shovel in Atlantic Canada], ''CBC'', January 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a third storm, a burst of snow, some of it [[lake effect snow|lake enhanced]], affected The Great Lakes from mid-afternoon New Year's Eve until mid-afternoon New Year's Day. Particularly hit hard were the cities of Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland. 3 to {{convert|6|in|cm}} of snow fell in many areas, with many parts of Michigan seeing over a foot of snow, including [[Capac, Michigan]], which reported {{convert|16|in|cm}} of snow. 36,000&amp;nbsp;people lost power in southeastern Michigan, and 10,000 lost power in Northeast Ohio. Detroit Metropolitan Airport and Chicago-O'Hare International Airport both reported numerous delays and 145 flights were canceled at O'Hare alone. There were no serious injuries or fatalities reported, but many spinouts and other accidents occurred.

====January 2–3====
A major winter storm event took place across portions of central Europe including [[Bulgaria]], Ukraine, [[Romania]] and southwestern Russia as well as areas near the [[Black Sea]]. The storm was responsible for the sinking of the ''M/S'' Vanessa, a Bulgarian cargo ship on the [[Kerch Strait]], killing at least 4 sailors. Up to {{convert|2|ft|cm}} of snow fell across portions Bulgaria and Romania severely disrupting transportation including the closure of [[Bucharest]]'s two main airports as well several ports around the Black Sea were also shut down. Electricity was also cut in about 300 towns and villages in Bulgaria and deliveries of food and water were also delayed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7169556.stm Storm brings chaos to Black Sea], ''BBC News'', January 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy snow fell in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] mountains from three storms. The heaviest snow occurred in the mountains south of [[Lake Tahoe]], with [[Kirkwood Mountain Resort]] receiving {{convert|11|ft|cm}} of snow. [[Sierra-at-Tahoe]] and [[Heavenly Ski Resort]] both received up to {{convert|8|ft|cm}} of snow. Snow depths of at least {{convert|5|ft|cm}} were widely reported. The snow was combined with wind gusts exceeding {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, creating blizzard and white-out conditions in the Sierra Nevada. The highest reported wind gust was {{convert|163|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on [[Ward Mountain (California)|Ward Mountain]].&lt;ref&gt;Esquival, Paloma, and Rong-Gong Lin II, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-storm5jan05,1,2117834.story O.C. burn areas under mandatory evacuation], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread reports of 3–6&amp;nbsp;inches of rain were received, and at the height of the storm approximately 2&amp;nbsp;million people were without power in California.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Ken, [http://www.accuweather.com/regional-news-story.asp?partner=accuweather&amp;traveler=0&amp;region=westusnews&amp;date=2008-01-07_22:50 Relief for some], ''AccuWeather'', January 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; About 3,000&amp;nbsp;people in [[Orange County, California]] were forced to evacuate their homes because of mudslide concerns in areas that had recently been burned in [[wildfire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Roesgen, Susan,  [http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/01/05/california.storms/index.html Storms cause trouble in Nevada, turn deadly in California], ''CNN'', January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These storms continued through the [[Intermountain West]] and into the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Heavy snow of 2–4&amp;nbsp;feet occurred in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], with a maximum of {{convert|50|in|cm}} reported at the [[Silverton, Colorado|Silverton]] Mountain Resort. Six snowmobilers who were stranded by the storm in southern Colorado found shelter in a cabin. However, 3&amp;nbsp;people were still missing; one hiker in the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] in southern California, and two skiers in Colorado near [[Wolf Creek Pass]]. At least three people were confirmed killed in the storm. A woman died when she drove her car across a flooded road in [[Chino, California]], one person was killed by a falling branch in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and person was killed by a falling tree in [[Central Point, Oregon]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  Two bodies discovered in Sacramento near a homeless camp were also being investigated as possibly weather-related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/01/07/winter.weather.ap/index.html Six missing snowmobilers safe after weekend lost in snow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511153441/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/01/07/winter.weather.ap/index.html |date=May 11, 2008 }}, ''Associated Press via CNN'', January 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Fernley, Nevada]] an irrigation ditch burst and flooded 290 homes with up to {{convert|8|ft|m}} of water; the cold weather then caused the water to freeze.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22541587/ Flooded, frozen town starts to thaw out], ''Associated Press via MSNBC'', Jan. 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In southeastern Utah, nine&amp;nbsp;people were killed and 20 injured after a charter bus returning from a ski trip in [[Telluride, Colorado]] ran off the road north of [[Mexican Hat, Utah|Mexican Hat]]. However, it was unknown if slick roads were the primary cause of the crash.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Winslow, Stephen Speckman and Pat Reavy, [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695242297,00.html Weather linked to crash that killed 9] ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'', Jan. 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====January 5–7====
A major snowstorm that dropped the heaviest snow in more than a decade in northern [[Iran]] killed at least 21&amp;nbsp;people and injured at least 88, with some people freezing to death, others dying in avalanches, and some dying after their cars overturned on snow-covered roads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/01/07/iran.snow.ap/index.html Iranian snow storm 'kills 21'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213102156/http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/01/07/iran.snow.ap/index.html |date=February 13, 2008 }}, ''Associated Press via CNN'', January 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Anywhere from {{convert|15|–|50|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} of snow were recorded in [[Tehran]], while about {{convert|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}} of snow fell in the [[Caspian Sea]] town of [[Bandar-e Anzali]] in [[Gīlān Province]] in northwestern Iran, usually a mild, damp place in winter. "Heavy" [[lake-effect snow|sea-effect snow]] also fell in [[Baku]], Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Jim, [http://www.accuweather.com/regional-news-story.asp?partner=accuweather&amp;traveler=0&amp;region=worldnews&amp;date=2008-01-07_19:00 Winter Storm slams Southwest Asia], ''AccuWeather'', January 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====January 13–14====
[[Image:January 2008 nor'easter radar loop.gif|200px|thumb|Radar loop of the January 13 nor'Easter]]
A [[Nor'easter]] developed along the Mid-atlantic coast, and moved northward.&lt;ref&gt;Penstone, Steve, [http://www.accuweather.com/regional-news-story.asp?partner=accuweather&amp;traveler=0&amp;region=eastusnews&amp;date=01-14-2008 Nor'easter Exits Tonight], ''AccuWeather'', January 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It affected the northeastern United States, eastern Quebec and the Canadian Maritimes with heavy snow, and high winds along the coast. Several areas across Maine, New Brunswick received snow amounts in excess of {{convert|1|ft|m|sing=on}} with as much as {{convert|20|in|cm}} locally across the [[Gaspe, Quebec|Gaspe]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accuweather.com/news-top-headline.asp?partner=accuweather&amp;traveler=0&amp;date=2008-01-14 Cold In as Snow Goes], ''AccuWeather'', January 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====January 17–18====
A low pressure system moving northward up the East Coast caused snow and rain to overspread the Mid-Atlantic region on January 17 and 18. Many spots started off as snow, with a gradual changeover to sleet, freezing rain and then finally rain as the storm slowed down. The greatest concern for accumulating ice was in western North Carolina, while the greatest accumulations of snow was expected in the Shenandoah Valley. Lighter accumulations of snow were expected along and west of I-95 in the Baltimore-Washington metro area, making for a difficult commute that afternoon. Winter storm watches and warnings extended from northern Georgia into southern Pennsylvania.

The wintry mix continued to spread northward overnight and into Friday. While New York and Boston saw mainly rain, accumulating snow occurred through the upper Delaware Valley and into the Hudson River Valley. The heaviest snow on Friday was expected for northern New Hampshire into Maine.

====January 24–31====
A rapid-fire series of major winter storms affected the western United States over the last week of January. The storms focused on California at first, bringing heavy rain and snow to the state. Up to {{convert|6|ft|cm}} of snow fell in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] early on, with 2–5&amp;nbsp;inches of rain falling in the lowlands of California and up to {{convert|8|in|mm}} in the foothills. The heaviest rains occurred around [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]. Many areas of southern California received more rain during these storms than what they saw the entire previous water year. Heavy snow periodically closed [[Interstate 5]] over the [[Grapevine, California|Grapevine]] (north of Los Angeles) due to the snow, as well as jackknifed tractor trailers, which stranded about 300 motorists for several hours. Heavy snow pounded all of the mountains of California, and 3 skiers were killed by avalanches on January 24 in the [[San Gabriel Mountains]], where locally {{convert|5|ft|cm}} of snow fell in the storm. Several mudslides and flash floods were reported in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and in Los Angeles, while several residents were forced to be evacuated from their homes in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]]. A [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] commuter train in Los Angeles hit mud and rocks that partially covered the tracks, causing it to be stranded along with its hundreds of passengers for over 2&amp;nbsp;hours before another train pulled it out from the debris. Wind gusts of 40–50&amp;nbsp;mph also affected areas of southern California. Combined with the heavy wind and rain in the region, widespread though spotty power cuts were reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/01/24/california.weather/index.html At least 300 motorists stranded in snow north of Los Angeles], ''CNN'', January 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turnto23.com/news/15123208/detail.html Grapevine Remains Closed Due To Snow], [[KERO-TV]], January 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktvu.com/news/15114935/detail.html Mother Nature Continues To Blanket Sierra Resorts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611112107/http://www.ktvu.com/news/15114935/detail.html |date=June 11, 2008 }}, ''[[KTVU]]'', January 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/01/26/california.weather.ap/index.html 3 dead in California avalanches as bad weather socks state], ''Associated Press via CNN'', January 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accuweather.com/news-top-headline.asp?partner=accuweather&amp;traveler=0&amp;date=2008-01-28_07:54 West Coast storm persists], ''AccuWeather'', January 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy snow also spread into the [[Inland Empire (Pacific Northwest)|Inland Empire]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The [[Spokane, Washington]] and [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]] areas saw two powerful storms during this time period, with local amounts of more than {{convert|2|ft|cm}} in a storm from the 26th–27th, with {{convert|13.7|in|cm}} in Spokane and up to {{convert|6|in|cm}} in [[Eugene, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110608154516/http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/WWNatSumm//2000s/2008/WWNatSumm-01-29-2008.pdf Weekly Weather Report: January 20–26, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; This storm caused numerous roofs to collapse near Coeur d'Alene. Another storm from late on the 30th to the 31st dropping up to {{convert|18|in|cm}} of snow in [[Pullman, Washington]] and [[Moscow, Idaho]]. [[Lewiston, Idaho]] recorded {{convert|6.1|in|cm}} inches, [[Pendleton, Oregon]] {{convert|9.3|in|cm}}, and Spokane an additional {{convert|9.2|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name="mannlib1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110608154527/http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/WWNatSumm//2000s/2008/WWNatSumm-02-05-2008.pdf Weekly Weather Report: January 27 – February 2, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous roads throughout the Spokane Valley, the [[Palouse]], and the surrounding mountains were closed at various times during the storms.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Clouse and Meghann M. Cuniff, [https://archive.is/20120918134641/http://www.spokesmanreview.com/breaking/story.asp?ID=13433 More snow to fall tonight], ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'', January 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Several inches of snow even fell in [[Seattle]] and down to the [[Oregon]] coast (a very rare event). Local amounts of over {{convert|4|ft|cm}} of snow fell in the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]]. [[Interstate 90]] over [[Snoqualmie Pass]], which had seen snowfall approaching {{convert|3|ft|cm}}, was hit by two avalanches in 3&amp;nbsp;days, the second of which buried 2 cars.&lt;ref&gt;Considine, Bob, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22931447/ Driver described being caught in avalanche] ''MSNBC'', January 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountains of [[Utah]] and [[Colorado]] also saw heavy snow of 2–4&amp;nbsp;feet during this time. The spate of late-month storms pushed [[Alta, Utah]] to a monthly total of {{convert|178.5|in|cm}} of snow, tying its January record first set in 1996.&lt;ref name="mannlib1"/&gt;

====January 29====

A major snowfall event affected portions of the Middle East including [[Israel]], Jordan, [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. One of the areas mostly affected was [[Jerusalem]] where schools (including the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]), stores and transportation were shut down after 5 to {{convert|8|in|cm}} of snow fell. The main highway between [[Tel Aviv]] and Jerusalem was also shortly closed because of the snow. The weather event had topped local headlines eclipsing a critical government report related to the [[2006 Lebanon War]] and Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]].&lt;ref&gt;Lefkovits, Etgar, [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1201523782656&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull J'lem meltdown begins after snowstorm]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', Jan 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/01/30/snow.jerusalem.ap/index.html Snowfall shuts down Jerusalem], ''Associated Press via CNN'', January 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====January 10 – February 5====
{{main|2008 Chinese winter storms}}
Several days of heavy wet snow, frigid temperatures and ice struck several regions of central China during the country's peak [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]] Travel Season. At least 107&amp;nbsp;people were killed by the storm which stranded several thousands of people, canceled numerous flights and damaged or destroyed several homes, power lines and crops which had raised concerns for food and water shortage a. Among the fatalities, 11 were killed by a bus accident in Anhui with flipped into a ditch on January 21.

The provinces of [[Hubei]], Henan, [[Shandong]], Jiangsu and [[Anhui]] were the hardest hit areas where some areas received their worst snow storm in 50 years. Snow persisted throughout the week with bitterly cold temperatures accompanying it. Tens of thousands of people were left stranded at several trains stations across southern China including [[Guangzhou]] Several main highways which also disrupted transportation of goods across several areas of the country.

Widespread power cuts were also reported and at one point, 17 of the 31 provinces had to endured reduced power supplies. It was estimated that about 827 000&amp;nbsp;people were evacuated across 14 provinces. The country's civil affairs ministry estimated that the severe weather affected 67&amp;nbsp;million people and that the costs were estimated at about 7.8&amp;nbsp;billion [[British pound]]s, 15.8&amp;nbsp;billion US Dollars or 111&amp;nbsp;billion [[Chinese yuan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.sina.com/china/1/2008/0213/145647.html, Harsh winter storms kill 107 people in China], ''Xinhua News Agency'', February 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bodeen, Christopher, [http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2008/01/20/4784056-ap.html Heavy snow blamed for 15 deaths in China] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070623032604/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2008/01/20/4784056-ap.html |date=June 23, 2007 }}, ''Associated Press via Canoe.ca'', January 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212007.stm Snow hampers China New Year plans], ''BBC'', January 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212823.stm Chinese freeze strands thousands], ''BBC'', January 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FlorCruz, Jaime, [http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/01/28/china.weather/index.html Snow slams China; half million stranded at train station], ''CNN'', January 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/01/31/china.weather/index.html China advises millions to abandon travel plans], ''CNN'', January 31, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt;

====January 27 – February 2====

[[Image:Nor'easter January 17–18 2008.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Satellite image of the January 27, 2008 nor'easter]]
A series of low pressure systems affected the eastern portion of North America with various types of weather. On January 27, a low pressure system which developed just off [[Cape Cod, Massachusetts]] brought a major ice storm for portions of the Canadian Maritimes on January 28 after dumping a few inches of snow across coastal sections of Massachusetts and Maine, and up to {{convert|13|in|cm}} of snow on Cape Cod. Particularly hard hit was Prince Edward Island where about one-third of the island lost power while numerous power poles and lines were downed due to the weight of the ice. Canadian Defense Minister [[Peter MacKay]] offered the province help with the services of the [[Canadian Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/prince-edward-island/story/2008/01/30/power-out.html Troops ready to help powerless P.E.I.], ''CBC'', January 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, another powerful storm moved across much of the continent, bringing first blizzard conditions and frigid temperatures from [[Alberta]] to [[Manitoba]] and down towards the [[Dakotas]] where temperatures dropped locally 40 degrees below zero with much colder windchills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/national/080128/n012887A.html Wicked weather hits Prairies with extreme wind chills and blizzard warnings], ''CBC'', January 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While approaching the eastern half of the continent, it intensified further and brought widespread damage wind some of them from thunderstorms. Winds exceeded locally as much as 120&amp;nbsp;km/h in some areas while blowing snow shut down many roads near the shorelines of [[Georgian Bay]] and [[Lake Huron]]. The cold front associated with the depression produced very rapid temperature drops in a short period from Iowa to southern Ontario. The storm killed at least two in Indiana due to an EF2 tornado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/080129_rpts.html SPC Storm Reports for January 29, 2008], [[Storm Prediction Center]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Ice storm 2008-02-01.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Satellite image of the storm which affected the Eastern United States with ice and snow]]
A third strong storm developed across the [[Texas Panhandle]] on January 31 and affected much of the Midwest and East with heavy snows from Northern Oklahoma to Quebec with significant ice across the Appalachians and the Ohio Valley and severe weather from southern Texas to the Middle Atlantic States. It brought massive amounts of snow to the Midwest with some isolated reports of {{convert|11|in|mm}} of snow. Chicago saw its largest snowstorm this season as it dropped over ten inches (203&amp;nbsp;mm)  of snow in downtown, building up traffic delays.[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=lot&amp;storyid=12666&amp;source=0] Across Ontario and Quebec it dumped about 8&amp;nbsp;inches of snow (20&amp;nbsp;cm) in Toronto, {{convert|13|to|14|in|cm|abbr=off}} in Ottawa, Gatineau and Quebec City and {{convert|11|in|cm}} in Montreal with higher amounts as much as {{convert|22|in|cm}} in the mountains north of Quebec City.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://lcn.canoe.ca/lcn/infos/national/archives/2008/02/20080202-090428.html La circulation automobile est difficile] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070623032604/http://lcn.canoe.ca/lcn/infos/national/archives/2008/02/20080202-090428.html |date=June 23, 2007 }}, ''Canadian Press via Canoe.ca'', February 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It also brought severe weather to the deep south bringing several inches of rain.

{{main|2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak}}

A major winter storm affected the Central United States and southern [[Ontario]] from February 5 into February 6. The storm stretched from Wisconsin all the way south into Mississippi. Across eastern Iowa, southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and lower Michigan, the storm dumped upwards of a foot or more of snow, with locally heavier amounts of {{convert|20|in|cm|0}} in some areas, particularly across southeast Wisconsin. In Ontario, {{convert|12|in|cm|0}} of snow fell in Toronto (with locally heavier amounts) with other areas of Ontario from Windsor to Ottawa receiving up to {{convert|12|in|cm|0}}. Winds of up to {{convert|25|mph|km/h|0}} and heavy snowfall rates made for blizzard conditions in some areas, making travel nearly impossible. Many places throughout northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin were forced to close on February 6, including schools, colleges, churches, health care centers, government buildings, businesses, and shopping malls. In addition, over 1000 flights were canceled at Chicago-O'Hare International Airport and 100 at Chicago-Midway International Airport while numerous flights were also cancelled at Toronto's [[Pearson International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-weather_07_webfeb07,0,7747217.story Fickle storm delivers a slushy punch], ''Chicago Tribune'', February 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the Milwaukee area, whiteout conditions forced the temporary closure of [[General Mitchell International Airport]], where half of its flights were canceled for the day. In addition, numerous accidents were reported across the area, including one fatality. Several interstates and other roadways were closed throughout Wisconsin due to either whiteout conditions or accidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=715255 Snowstorm living up to advance billing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503041051/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=715255 |date=May 3, 2008 }}, ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel'', February 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The National Guard was brought in to assist over 2000 stranded motorists on a {{convert|19|mi|km|sing=on}} stretch of I-90 between Janesville, WI, and Madison after several semi trailers lost traction and blocked the road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=715255 JS Online: Ground to a halt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503041051/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=715255 |date=May 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same storm system brought heavy rain across portions of the Ohio Valley, with severe thunderstorms further south. Kentucky, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama all saw tornadoes from mid-afternoon February 5 to the early morning hours of February 6. 33&amp;nbsp;people were killed in Tennessee, 14 in Arkansas, 7 in Kentucky, and 5 in Alabama. In all, at least 59&amp;nbsp;people have been killed by the tornadoes, making it the deadliest outbreak since the [[1985 United States-Canadian tornado outbreak]] of 1985, which killed 88&amp;nbsp;people. In addition, over 100&amp;nbsp;people have been injured. The storm tore off the roof of a shopping mall in Memphis, trapped college students at [[Union University]] in [[Jackson, Tennessee]], ignited a gas fire near Nashville, and demolished warehouses in [[Southaven, Mississippi]], in addition to destroying numerous homes. Over 103 separate tornadoes were reported. Several presidential candidates paused to remember victims during their speeches after the [[Super Duper Tuesday|Super Tuesday primaries]], with several tornadoes still occurring as they were speaking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080206/ap_on_re_us/severe_weather Storms rip through South, killing 48], ''Associated Press via Yahoo!'', February 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====February 12–14====
On February 11, a low pressure system moved out of the U.S. Plain States into the eastern half of the United States and eastern Canada. The low pressure system began to strengthen, and slowly moved east. Snow began to fall in on the northern side of the system as the storm moved off the coast. It all but stalled, and the snow soon turned to ice for most of the affected area. After the ice storm, temperatures warmed to above freezing, and most of the precipitation turned to all rain for all areas other than the far northern fringes of the storm. The rain lasted for several hours in many places, with some areas receiving {{convert|3|in|cm}} of rain, which caused minor flooding in low-lying and urban areas. As the primary low pressure system moved away, a smaller low formed, which enhanced rainfall and extended precipitation for several more hours. By early on February 14, the storm had moved away. On the northern side of the system between 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm of snow fell from Wisconsin to New Brunswick.&lt;ref name="feb12-14"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heavy Snow and Dangerous Ice|year=2008 |publisher= Accuweather|accessdate=February 14, 2008 |url=http://www.accuweather.com/news-top-headline.asp?partner=accuweather&amp;traveler=0&amp;date=2008-02-11&amp;month=2&amp;day=1&amp;year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== February 17–18 ====
A panhandle hook winter storm combined with an [[Alberta clipper]] crossed the central United States, spreading rain, ice and heavy snow to parts of the upper Midwest and Northeast as well as eastern Canada from southern Manitoba to the Canadian Maritimes. Portions of Iowa and Manitoba were under blizzard warnings. Areas from northern Ontario to southern Wisconsin were under winter storm warnings while much of Ontario and Quebec were under freezing rain warnings. The ice event may have been blamed for a late-evening incident at the [[Ottawa International Airport]] where a [[Boeing 737]] [[WestJet]] flight from [[Calgary]] slid off an icy runway and ending off into a snowbank. No injuries among the 94 passengers and crew members were reported in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=f999a785-d7f2-4452-9618-eae45cb87a14&amp;k=88948 Runway scare] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312210436/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=f999a785-d7f2-4452-9618-eae45cb87a14&amp;k=88948 |date=March 12, 2012 }}, ''Ottawa Citizen'', February 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally between {{convert|4|to|8|in|cm|abbr=off}} of snow fell across the Midwest and portions of Ontario although locally across Wisconsin amounts approached {{convert|1|ft|cm}}. The system was also notable for a tornado outbreak across Alabama, Georgia and Florida where dozens of tornadoes touched down injuring at least 30.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=grb&amp;storyid=13060&amp;source=0 24 Hour Snowfall], ''NWS Green Bay, Wisconsin'', February 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/02/18/severe.weather.ap/index.html Searchers look for trapped tornado victims], ''CNN'', February 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy snowfall in Greece cut off access to at least 150 villages and was followed by a major cold snap. Significant power outages and water supply shortages were reported across many areas. Hardest hit areas were the island of [[Crete]] and [[Euboea|Evia]] as well as the southern portions of the [[Peloponnese]] Peninsula. In [[Athens]], where at least {{convert|15|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} fell, dozens of flights from the [[Athens International Airport|Athens Airport]] were cancelled while most schools throughout the city were shut down.

===September===

====September 14–16====
On September 14 to 16, a major sandstorm covered an area between the cities of [[Baghdad]], [[Mosul]] and [[Kirkuk]]. It had apparently started in on the [[Syrian]]/[[Iraq]] on the 14th and had spread in to neighbouring parts of [[Iran]], Turkey and most of [[Syria]] by the 16th.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eosnap.com/?p=635 EOsnap.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===October===

====October 10–12====
A huge early season storm began to develop over the [[Great Basin]] on the 10th and snowfall spread through the [[Idaho]] mountains and into [[Montana]]. It spread eastward through the rest of Montana and [[Wyoming]] throughout the 10th, bringing heavy snowfall to the northern [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] and adjacent [[Rocky Mountains]]. Snow will fill in across [[Utah]] and [[Colorado]] on the 11th, and as the strong low pressure area moves northeast through Wyoming and into the High Plains, snow will once again intensify across those regions.

The mountains of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah will see widespread totals of 1–2 feet of snow, with up to 4 feet in the mountains of south-central Montana and the [[Bighorn Mountains]] of Wyoming. Snow will fall to the valley floors across the region as well, bringing at least 4&amp;nbsp;inches to most mountain valley locations, with over 12&amp;nbsp;inches in some areas. On the High Plains, snow of 6–12&amp;nbsp;inches will occur from southern [[Saskatchewan]] through eastern Montana, western [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]], and eastern Wyoming. Amounts of 1–2 feet are possible in the far western High Plains region from approximately [[Billings, Montana|Billings]] to [[Sheridan, Wyoming|Sheridan]]. In addition, approximately 3–6&amp;nbsp;inches are expected in the valleys of eastern Idaho, northeastern [[Nevada]], and western Utah, with locally greater totals downwind of the [[Great Salt Lake]] due to the [[lake-effect snow|lake-effect]]. The plateaus of southern Wyoming will see [[blizzard]] conditions, while the western mountains of Colorado will see up to a foot of snow. This storm is expected to be one of the largest storms to ever affect the region so early in the year.

====October 29====
The first snowfall in Eastern Canada dumped up to 15&amp;nbsp;cm of wet snow in Northwestern and southwestern [[Quebec]] and the neighboring regions of eastern [[Ontario]], knocking electricity out for some 70,000 people and forcing the closure of several schools and school boards. The same depression also caused worries in [[Gaspésie]] due to rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/National/2008/10/29/001-neige-elect-que.shtml Radia-canada.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2008/10/29/mtl-snowfall1029.html | work=CBC News | title=Fall snowstorm knocks out power in eastern Ontario, western Quebec | date=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of New York and [[Pennsylvania]] received as much as 1-foot of snow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20081029/OTT_snowfall_081029/20081029/?hub=OttawaHome Ottawa.ctv.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

===November===

====November 5–7====

A major winter storm affected portions of the northern Plains of North America from the [[Dakotas]] to [[Manitoba]]. Blizzard conditions across the Dakotas made travel nearly impossible with several roads shut down due to whiteout conditions and winds in excess of 60&amp;nbsp;mph. As much as 15&amp;nbsp;inches fell in [[North Dakota]] in [[Towner, North Dakota|Towner]] and [[Velva, North Dakota|Velva]], while significant ice fell near the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] and [[Devils Lake (North Dakota)|Devil's Lake]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo=bis&amp;storyid=19229&amp;source=November 0 5–7 Snowfall Totals], NWS Bismarck, ND, November 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.naa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo=fgf&amp;storyid=19215&amp;source=0 Preliminary Rain and Snow Totals]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} NWS Grand Forks, ND, November 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Lighter amounts was observed in [[South Dakota]] where at most 8&amp;nbsp;inches fell west of the state capital [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo=abr&amp;storyid=19208&amp;source=0 Summary of November 5–7 Winter Storm/Blizzard Event], NWS Aberdeen, SD, November 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In Manitoba, where 20 centimeters of snow fell, about 2,000 collisions were reported in and around the Winnipeg area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081107/winnipeg_weather_081107/20081107/ Winter storm wallops Manitoba, Dakotas], CTV, November 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====November 18–22====

The first major snowsquall event of the year occurred in [[Southern Ontario]] and parts of [[Michigan]], [[Pennsylvania]] and New York. About 100&amp;nbsp;cm (1 metre) was recorded in some areas.

At the same time a coastal system produced a major snowstorm across the [[Canadian Maritimes]] shutting down many roads in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]. About 30&amp;nbsp;cm of snow fell in the [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] area and about 20 in [[Moncton]]. Over 10,000 customers lost power during the storm. In another snow event during the week preceding the main storm about 1,500 motorists were stranded on the [[Cobequid Pass]] of [[Highway 104 (Nova Scotia)|Highway 104]] in Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081122/heavy_snowfall_081112/20081122/ CTV.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

====November 19–24 (Europe)====
A strong high [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] emanating from [[Greenland]] crossed Europe creating the first wintry conditions in the season. The ridge interacted over the [[Black sea]] with an extratropical [[cyclone]], which later created high [[winds]] of 25&amp;nbsp;m/s (force 10, with gusts up to [[beaufort scale|force]] 12 over Baltic sea) with snowfall over much of eastern and northeastern Europe. Disruptions in power supply, traffic, air traffic and shipping on the [[Baltic sea]] were widespread. The cyclone eventually filled over [[Estonia]] leaving about a foot of snow over much of the affected area.

====November 25 – December 1====

A large extratropical cyclone struck California late on November 25. Floods Watches and Warnings, Winter Storm Watches and Warnings were issued for California and Nevada. A flood advisory was in effect for Clark County and Winter Storm Warnings were in effects for the Serrria range. In Canada, Winter Storm Warnings and [[Snowfall Warnings]] are in effect, while in some areas it dumped 30&amp;nbsp;cm, and other areas saw only rain. [[Wiarton]] saw 30&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Barrie]] saw 10&amp;nbsp;cm and Toronto saw rain with mixing at times. Many delays at airports were reported like at Chicago's [[O'Hare Airport]].

====December 3–5====

A [[winter storm]] is affecting portions of [[Ontario]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Illinois]], and [[Michigan]]. Upwards of {{convert|20|–|30|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} was reported in some areas. In behind it, cold [[Arctic]] air is rushing in from the North, and temperatures are dropping rapidly. This is the first major cold wave of the season. The cold air mass has developed more snow [[squall]]s of the lakes, as much as 40&amp;nbsp;cm or more could fall in parts of [[Michigan]] and 30&amp;nbsp;cm or more near the [[snowbelt]] region of Ontario.

====December 6 – December 7====

A fast moving system known as an Alberta clipper is affecting areas around the [[Great Lakes]] with up to {{convert|5|–|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in most areas. Area's around the lakes could get more snow, because of enhancement off of the Lakes. The storm then affected the northeast with as much as 4&amp;nbsp;inches of snow, Major cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Providence, Washington D.C., Pittsburgh, Buffalo, and Albany all got some type of snow accumulation. Chicago was hit by freezing air temps. At one point in Boston, 0.5 mile [[visibility]] was observed. Long Island, N.Y. had snow ranging from 1&amp;nbsp;inch in Islip, to 3.5&amp;nbsp;inches in Huntington. Temperatures in Chicago were as low as 3 degrees{{vague|which degrees? assuming Fahrenheit, fix if not|date=December 2009}} Fahrenheit and in the States of Wisconsin and Minnesota, temperatures were in the negatives with Duluth at {{convert|6|°F|°C}} below 0 and Green Bay saw temperatures at {{convert|4|°F|°C}} below 0. Temperatures continued to drop in the Northeast, with overnight temperatures in the low teens. Minneapolis was in the negatives all day and at one point it was {{convert|10|°F|°C}} below 0. States such as [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Michigan]], [[Illinois]], [[Ohio]], [[Virginia]], and all of the Northeast states were hit by this system with freezing air temperatures and snow accumulations.

====December 7–8====

A winter storm is affecting parts of [[Atlantic Canada]]. As much as 25–50&amp;nbsp;mm of rain could fall in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and parts of [[New Brunswick]]. Northern Quebec could see 20–30&amp;nbsp;cm, with similar amounts in [[Labrador]]. Winds gusting over 100&amp;nbsp;km/h are quite possible, once the storm passes, with much colder temperatures. Many areas reported seeing strong gusty winds. Driving will be hazardous in many areas of the Atlantic provinces. As much as 20&amp;nbsp;cm was recorded in parts of [[Quebec]], and Northern [[New Brunswick]].

==== December 8–12 ====

A powerful [[Panhandle hook]] storm tracked across the Midwestern US, Great Lakes and eastern Canada regions where heavy snow fell from northern Iowa to eastern Quebec. Numerous winter storm, heavy snowfall and freezing rain warnings were issued.
Snowfall and mixed precipitation fell in parts of [[Michigan]], [[Illinois]], [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Wisconsin]] and Southern [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] and much of [[New Brunswick]].

The [[Greater Toronto Area]] saw between 5 and 10 centimeters before the changeover to rain with local freezing rain particularly north and east of the city. Many areas of central, northeastern and eastern Ontario as well as southern received from 15 to 35 centimeters including 20&amp;nbsp;cm in the [[Montreal]] area and 30&amp;nbsp;cm in the [[Ottawa]] and surrounding region with a few hours of freezing rain from 9&amp;nbsp;pm to 1&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20081210/OTT_commute_081210/20081210/?hub=OttawaHome Ottawa.ctv.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; The snow storm further complicated the commuters in the Ottawa area where a transit strike at [[OC Transpo]] started. About 20 centimeters was recorded in [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]] and up to 30 centimeters in and around the Cottage Country near the Parry Sound and Haliburton regions. There were over 100 crashes reported in Southern Ontario, because of icy conditions and snow.

In the US, up to 11–12&amp;nbsp;inches fell in Wisconsin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo=grb&amp;storyid=19946&amp;source=0 CRH.NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo=mkx&amp;storyid=19920&amp;source=0 CRH.NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; 14&amp;nbsp;inches in Michigan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo=apx&amp;storyid=19935&amp;source=0 CRH.NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; 5&amp;nbsp;inches in northern Illinois&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo=lot&amp;storyid=19942&amp;source=0 CRH.NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; and 7&amp;nbsp;inches in Iowa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/dmx/winterwx-post.php CRH.NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

The storm was also accompanied by heavy rain further south and severe storms which spawned tornadoes from the [[Alexandria, Louisiana]] area to near [[Birmingham, Alabama]] to west of [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/081209_rpts.html SPC.NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/081210_rpts.html SPC.NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; There were 36 reported tornadoes in an outbreak in the southern part of this storm. 33 of those tornadoes were confirmed with five of those EF2s, two in Mississippi, two in Alabama, and one in Louisiana with many destroyed homes, damaged buildings, and overturned cars. Many people were injured in the tornadoes. Other than the EF2s, many EF0s and EF1s were confirmed with damage in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, and Georgia. One EF0 tornado in Georgia was caught on film as it was hitting a high school, damaging it. The outbreak was one of the largest in the month of December.

A second storm, with a cold-core upper low, developed on December 11 behind the first one, and spread snow across parts of the Gulf Coast states including the cities of [[Houston]], Texas, [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and New Orleans, Louisiana as well as parts of southern [[Mississippi]]. Four inches fell in [[Lumberton, Texas|Lumberton]] and [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]] in southeast Texas&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/productview.php?pil=PNSLCH SRH.NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as just outside the Baton Rouge area and south central [[Louisiana]]. Some areas of west-central Louisiana received as much as 6&amp;nbsp;inches, while areas just south of [[Jackson, Mississippi]] received 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jan/events/2008/Dec11snow/GraphiCast_midterm_121208_081642.jpg SRH.NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/events/121108.php SRG.NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wafb.com/Global/story.asp?S=9502584 WAFB.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first snowfall for the downtown New Orleans area since 2004 while its all-time snowfall record for one storm was 5&amp;nbsp;inches in December 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klfy.com/Global/story.asp?S=9504404&amp;nav=menu61_2 KLFY.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The winter weather caused local power outages in several parishes in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klfy.com/Global/story.asp?S=9504352&amp;nav=menu61_2 KLFY.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Houston's first snowfall since 2004.
[[Image:Trees with Ice.JPG|thumb|150px|Ice storm in [[Upstate New York]], December 12, 2008]]
While wintry precipitation was light and more scarce across the [[Tennessee Valley]], a swath of freezing rain developed across the northeast, dumping heavy amounts of ice across most of New England. Up to one million customers lost electricity across the entire region due to the ice and high winds from northern New York to [[Maine]]. States of emergency were declared by the governors of [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]] and New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/12/12/storm.new.york.massachusetts/index.html | work=CNN | title=Storm leaves at least 1 million without power in Northeast | date=December 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Snowfall amounts topped 9&amp;nbsp;inches across parts of northern [[Vermont]] and New Hampshire.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In the [[Maritime provinces]] of Canada, several hours of [[freezing rain]] were reported, followed by much warmer temperatures. [[Moncton]], New Brunswick hit {{convert|60|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, which caused flooding.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

====December 12–17====
A major [[winter storm]] affected the west coast with rain and snowfall as well as high winds. About 13&amp;nbsp;cm of snow fell in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia on December 13, while about 20&amp;nbsp;cm fell in the interior of British Columbia. In behind the storm, a cold air mass developed over British Columbia and temperatures dropped well below the freezing mark for a daytime high even in cities like Vancouver and Victoria. The storm will affect the [[Canadian Prairies]], and U.S. [[Prairies]] with [[blizzard]] like conditions, likely 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm could fall, with local amounts of 20&amp;nbsp;cm or more. The windchill could drop below −35&amp;nbsp;°C in southern [[Saskatchewan]], and parts of [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]]. Windchill warnings have been posted for those areas. This is a major Arctic outbreak in Western Canada and U.S. Around the [[Great lakes]], [[Wawa, Ontario|Wawa]], Ontario saw {{convert|24|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, Thunder bay, Ontario saw {{convert|23|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, with lighter amounts away from the center. [[Southern Ontario]] saw rain, with strong winds Monday, taking down trees (Toronto reached winds of 40–60&amp;nbsp;km/h), it has cooled down in Southern Ontario, and parts of the U.S. Northeast. In the [[Maritime provinces]], warmer weather is continuing, but by Tuesday everything will cool down.

====December 16–17====
A moderately harsh winter storm struck the Midwestern United States on December 16, dropping 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;inches of snow. In [[Southern Ontario]], the [[Greater Toronto Area]] has seen 8–10&amp;nbsp;cm. With 10&amp;nbsp;cm in [[Barrie]], and 11&amp;nbsp;cm in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], Ontario. Heavier snow fell in Midwestern United States where as much as 15&amp;nbsp;cm or more was recorded. There were over 200 crashes in Southern Ontario, many of them because of careless driving. The storm is affected regions of [[Atlantic Canada]], with 15&amp;nbsp;cm in Southern [[New Brunswick]], with similar amounts in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].

A low pressure system moved northeastward from the Pacific Ocean in the [[Southwestern United States]], along with arctic air produced {{convert|1|to| 12|in|cm}} of snow in the [[Las Vegas Valley]] with Las Vegas receiving 1 to 4&amp;nbsp;inches and Henderson receiving {{convert|5|to| 10|in|cm}}, outer edges of the valley received up to a foot of snow. This was the largest snow event in the Las Vegas Valley in over 30 years. The deserts of California also saw a snow event with the same system. Barstow (a [[San Bernardino]] suburb) received {{convert|3|to|6|in|cm}} of snow.

====December 17–19====
A quick moving Colorado low, affected portions of the southwest, Midwestern US as well as parts of eastern Canada. Previously, the storm produced snow across the Pacific Northwest including the Seattle, Vancouver and Victoria area. Snowfall of {{convert|4|to| 8|in|cm}} was later reported in and around the [[Las Vegas Valley]] setting an all-time one-day December snowfall which was previously held in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/total_forecast/getprod.php?wfo=vef&amp;sid=vef&amp;pil=rer WRH.NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy snow affected parts of Wisconsin and Michigan dumping up to a foot of snow in the Milwaukee area heavily disrupting air traffic at [[General Mitchell International Airport]] NWS Milwaukee, December 20, 2008. Over a foot of snow was also reported locally around [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland]] and [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb Counties]] near Detroit. The storm also brought about {{convert|3.8|in|abbr=on}} to Las Vegas, the most snow over 3 decades. Most of southwestern Ontario, next in path of the storm received {{convert|15|to|30|cm|abbr=on}}. The snow and blowing snow was the cause of a 25-car pile-up on Highway 400 north of Toronto injuring at least five.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081219/storm_crashes_081219?s_name=&amp;no_ads= CTV.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; The storm also affected parts of New England still recovering from the previous week's ice storm that left over 1 million customers without power.

By December 19 the storm sped up and dumped {{convert|8|to|12|in|abbr=on}} across parts of the northeast, including 12&amp;nbsp;inches from western New York to western Massachusetts. New York City saw several inches of snow before a change to freezing rain and then rain. Up to half of foot of snow is expected in Boston later this evening, before the storm pulls off the coast and strengthens further, effecting the Canadian maritimes as a winter mix of snow and freezing rain. During the storm's peak, as many as 1,000 flights were canceled across the northeast.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=ayAe4hdATMQI&amp;refer=home Bloomberg.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

South of the snow band, a strong ice storm affected the states of Missouri, Iowa and Illinois. Ice accumulation was up to 1.25&amp;nbsp;inch in some parts of Illinois. Roads are very dangerous and hazardous. Interstates were covered in a sheet of thick ice. Many airports (including Chicago O'Hare) are experiencing cancellations and delays. Schools are also being canceled and delayed. About 300 delays were reported at [[Toronto's Pearson International Airport]].

====December 19–22====
{{main|December 2008 North American snowstorms}}
A winter storm formed off the Pacific coast before affecting the [[Midwest]] and [[Northeastern United States]], later during the weekend, right around the [[Winter Solstice]]. The winter storm eventually absorbed another low from the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/12/19/us.storm/?imw=Y&amp;iref=mpstoryemail | work=CNN | title=Northwest braces for wintry storm | date=December 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter storm watches and blizzard warnings (not related to the previous storm) were issued from Washington to Maine, as the storm was expected to bring immediate blizzard conditions to parts of the West and Midwest, before affecting the Northeast on Sunday, December 21.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--http://www.examiner.com/a-1754727~Less_snow_but_still_cold_in_Washington_state.html --&gt;Examiner.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newrichmond-news.com/articles/index.cfm?id=23782&amp;section=News Newrichmond-news.com]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm was expected to bring winds as high as 90&amp;nbsp;mph to parts of Washington, by Saturday, December 20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/392873_forecast19.html Seattlepi.nwsource.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West Coast, the powerful winter storm affected major cities. [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, and the surrounding areas saw about 15–30&amp;nbsp;cm of snow, with higher amounts in the higher elevations of the city and on [[Vancouver Island]]. Also, in Vancouver, temperatures dropped to about -15&amp;nbsp;°C on December 20, setting an all-time daily low temperature for that day. Down south, towards [[Washington (state)|Washington]], 15–20&amp;nbsp;cm of snow also fell, with lighter amounts south of [[Seattle]], WA. Many delays were reported at the major airports. Snowfall estimates for the Northeast on Sunday, December 21 currently range from estimates of 4–6&amp;nbsp;inches for [[New England]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theithacajournal.com/article/20081219/NEWS01/812190318 Theithacajournal.com]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to estimates of 5–10&amp;nbsp;inches in the [[Adirondacks]] by the [[National Weather Service]]. The storm brought 15&amp;nbsp;cm of snow to the Greater Toronto Area, with higher amounts towards [[Lake Huron]], [[Georgian Bay]], and the Niagara Region. This winter storm also brought strong winds, gusting to 90&amp;nbsp;km/h in some areas. The storm brought [[blizzard]] conditions, causing delays at the major airports. As much as 20–40&amp;nbsp;cm fell in [[New Brunswick]], and a wintery mix in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. The winter storm also caused [[storm surge]]s, with the brisk winds. Resultingly, warnings and watches were issued in the [[Atlantic provinces]]. In the Northeast US, some localized areas reported 60&amp;nbsp;cm of snow, with 30–50&amp;nbsp;cm in other areas. The storm cut the power to many people, most of them in the State of [[Maine]].

====December 22–25====
{{main|December 2008 North American snowstorms}}
A winter storm developed just off the West Coast, on December 22, becoming a major [[Winter storm]] after it moved northward into the U.S. [[Midwest]], and the [[Great lakes region]]. The winter storm affected those regions from December 23 to Christmas Day on December 25. The [[Greater Toronto Area]] saw 10–15&amp;nbsp;cm of snow, London, Ontario about 20&amp;nbsp;cm, with 5&amp;nbsp;cm in [[Barrie]], Ontario. Rain should followed, behind the snow, with 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm in [[Southern Ontario]]. The heavy rain and snow resulted in delays at many airports; at the [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]] Airport, and Pearson International, on a busy travelling day (December 24) because of icy and slippery conditions. The storm also brought [[freezing rain]] and snow in the Atlantic Provinces, which eventually changed to rain before Christmas. Northern [[New Brunswick]] and [[Quebec]] saw mostly snow.

On the West Coast, there was about anywhere from 10–35&amp;nbsp;cm of snow in many areas of [[British Columbia]], mostly along the coast towards [[Vancouver]], which saw about 20–25&amp;nbsp;cm. Some of the hills/higher elevations in Metro Vancouver saw 30–35&amp;nbsp;cm of snow, and temperatures were still in the sub-zero range in all areas of the south coast from the December 14. Lesser amounts of snow fell in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], British Columbia, and on [[Vancouver Island]], with about 15&amp;nbsp;cm of snow in Victoria.

====December 30 – January 1====
An Alberta clipper affected the [[Great lakes region]], the [[Midwestern United States]], and the [[Northeastern United States]]. [[Greater Toronto Area]] saw about 7–10&amp;nbsp;cm, with higher amounts towards the [[Niagara, Toronto|Niagara]] region. After moving off the East Coast, the winter storm quickly began to strengthen over the [[Atlantic]], becoming a [[blizzard]]. The Northeastern United States saw about 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm of snow. The Atlantic provinces were impacted by [[Blizzard]] conditions on New Year's Day, with 49&amp;nbsp;cm of snow recorded in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and 25&amp;nbsp;cm of snow in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. Blizzard warnings and [[storm surge]] warnings were issues, as sustained [[winds]] from the North exceeded {{convert|60|–|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] saw about 15–25&amp;nbsp;cm of snow, with blowing snow. Another 15–20&amp;nbsp;cm fell in the Canadian province, as another low moved in.

The '''Grotta Gigante horizontal pendulums''' are a pair of [[tiltmeter]]s used for monitoring Earth movements, mounted in the [[Grotta Gigante]] in Italy. The horizontal pendulums, installed by the geodesist [[Antonio Marussi]] in 1959, are sensitive to deviations of the vertical, to rotations and shearing of the cave.

The pendulum beam is suspended horizontally by two steel wires, an upper one fixed to the roof of the cave, the lower one fixed to the floor.  The pendulum beam rotates in the horizontal plane around a virtual near-to-vertical axis that passes through the upper and lower mounting points.  

==Measurements==
Some movements are aperiodic, others regular, as the Earth [[tides]] caused by the lunar and solar gravitational field. The pendulums measure a distance of 95 m between the upper and lower mountings, which contributes to the fact that the instruments detect tectonic movements with high precision and are relatively immune to some of the noise which affects smaller instruments.

The [[Earth's crust]] is the outer brittle layer of our planet, on average {{convert|35|km}} thick in continental areas. This moves up and down by ten centimeters during the time of 12 and 24 hours due to the attraction of Moon and Sun, and is accompanied by a local tilting of some parts in a billion of radians.

The movements of the pendulums has contributed to identify the free oscillations of the Earth, and to show that the secular term tilting of the cave is towards the northwest. The marine tides of the Adriatic have a loading effect in the cave, as have also the underground carstic floods of the [[river Timavo]] that disappears at the [[Skocjanske Cave]] in Slovenia.  The Grotta Gigante tiltmeters are the only existing instruments to have recorded four out of five greatest earthquakes in the recent 50 years, which are the earthquakes of [[Chile earthquake 1960|Chile 1960]] (the greatest earthquake ever instrumentally recorded) and [[Chile earthquake 2010|Chile 2010]] (the fifth in the scale of recorded worldwide mega-events) the tsunami-generating event of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Sumatra-Andaman islands of 2004]] (third greatest event) and the event of [[Japan earthquake 2011|Japan 2011]] (fourth greatest event), allowing an absolute-amplitude comparison between these events.

4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{pad|10px}}[[redox|Reduction]] (generation of dihydrogen)

2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{pad|10px}}Total Reaction

Of the two half reactions, the oxidation step is the most demanding because it requires the coupling of 4 electron and proton transfers and the formation of an oxygen-oxygen bond. This process occurs naturally in plants [[photosystem II]] to provide protons and electrons for the [[photosynthesis]] process and release oxygen to the atmosphere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blankenship |first1=R.E. |last2=Tiede |first2=D.M. |last3=Barber |first3=J. |last4=Brudvig |first4=G.W. |last5=Fleming |first5=G. |last6=Ghirardi |first6=M. |last7=Gunner |first7=M.R. |last8=Junge |first8=W. |last9=Kramer |first9=D.M. |last10=Melis |first10=A. |last11=Moore |first11=T.A. |last12=Moser |first12=C.C. |last13=Nocera |first13=D.G. |last14=Nozik |first14=A.J. |last15=Ort |first15=D.R. |last16=Parson |first16=W.W. |last17=Prince |first17=R.C. |last18=Sayre |first18=R.T. |title=Comparing Photosynthetic and Photovoltaic Efficiencies and Recognizing the Potential for Improvement |journal=Science |date=2011 |volume=332 |issue=6031 |page=805 |doi=10.1126/science.1200165 |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6031/805}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in some [[electrowinning]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kotyk |first1=J.F.K. |last2=Chen |first2=C. |last3=Sheehan |first3=S.W. |title=Corrosion Potential Modulation on Lead Anodes Using Water Oxidation Catalyst Coatings |journal=Coatings |date=2018 |volume=8 |issue=7 |page=246 |doi=10.3390/coatings8070246 |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2079-6412/8/7/246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since hydrogen can be used as an alternative clean burning fuel, there has been a need to split water efficiently. However, there are known materials that can mediate the reduction step efficiently therefore much of the current research is aimed at the oxidation half reaction also known as the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). Current research focuses on understanding the mechanism of OER and development of new materials that catalyze the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsl.caltech.edu/research:anode |title=Anode - Lewis Research Group |publisher=Nsl.caltech.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermodynamics==
Both the oxidation and reduction steps are pH dependent. Figure 1 shows the standard potentials at pH 0 (strongly acidic) as referenced to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).

2 half reactions (at pH = 0)&lt;br /&gt;
Oxidation{{pad|10px}}2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{pad|10px}}E° = 1.23 V vs. NHE

Reduction{{pad|10px}}4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{pad|10px}}E° = 0.00 V vs. NHE

Overall{{pad|10px}}2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{pad|10px}}E°cell = -1.23 V; ΔG = 475 kJ/mol &lt;br /&gt;
					

Water splitting can be done at higher pH values as well however the standard potentials will vary according to the [[Nernst equation]] and therefore shift by -59 mV for each pH unit increase. However, the total cell potential (difference between oxidation and reduction half cell potentials) will remain 1.23 V. This potential can be related to [[Gibbs free energy]] (ΔG) by:

ΔG°cell = −nFE°cell

Where n is the number of electrons per mole products and F is the [[Faraday constant]]. Therefore, it takes 475 kJ of energy to make one mole of O2 as calculated by thermodynamics. However, in reality no process can be this efficient.  Systems always suffer from an overpotential that arise from activation barriers, concentration effects and voltage drops due to resistance. The activation barriers or [[activation energy]] is associated with high energy transition states that are reached during the electrochemical process of OER. The lowering of these barriers would allow for OER to occur at lower overpotentials and faster rates.

==Mechanism==
Heterogeneous OER is sensitive to the surface which the reaction takes place and is also affected by the pH of the solution. The general mechanism for acidic and [[alkaline]] solutions is shown below. Under acidic conditions water binds to the surface with the irreversible removal of one electron and one proton to form a platinum hydroxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Conway |first1=B.E. |last2=Liu |first2=T.C. |title=Characterization of electrocatalysis in the oxygen evolution reaction at platinum by evaluation of behavior of surface intermediate states at the oxide film |journal=Langmuir |date=1990 |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=268 |doi=10.1021/la00091a044 |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la00091a044}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an alkaline solution a reversible binding of hydroxide ion coupled to a one electron oxidation is thought to precede a turnover-limiting [[electrochemical]] step involving the removal of one proton and one electron to form a surface oxide species.&lt;ref name="Birss1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Birss |first1=V.I. |last2=Damjanovic |first2=A. |last3=Hudson |first3=P.G. |title=Oxygen Evolution at Platinum Electrodes in Alkaline Solutions: II .

==Catalyst Materials==
OER has been studied on a variety of materials including:
* platinum surfaces &lt;ref name="Birss1"/&gt;
*transition metal oxides &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matsumoto |first1=Y. |last2=Sato |first2=E. |title=Electrocatalytic properties of transition metal oxides for oxygen evolution reaction |journal=Mater. Chem. Phys. |date=1986 |volume=14 |issue=5 |page=397 |doi=10.1016/0254-0584(86)90045-3 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0254058486900453}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*first-row transition metal [[spinels]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parmon |first1=V.M. |last2=Elizarova |first2=G.L. |last3=Kim |first3=T.V. |title=Spinels as heterogeneous catalysts for oxidation of water to dioxygen by tris-bipyridyl complexes of iron(III) and ruthenium(III) |journal=Reaction Kinetics and Catalysis Letters |date=1982 |volume=21 |issue=3 |page=195 |doi=10.1007/BF02070609 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02070609}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[perovskites]].&lt;ref&gt;Bockris, J. O’M. and Otagawa, T. J. Phys. Chem. 1983, 87, 2960&lt;/ref&gt; Recently [[Metal-Organic Framework]] (MOF)-based materials have been shown to be a highly promising candidate for water oxidation with first row transition metals.;&lt;ref&gt;Das et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2013, 52, 7224-7227 (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201301327/abstract)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen and Das, Energy &amp; Environ Sci.(http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/ee/c3ee43040e#!divAbstract)&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparation of the surface and electrolysis conditions have a large effect on reactivity (defects, steps, kinks, low coordinate sites) therefore it is difficult to predict an OER material's properties by its bulk structure. Surface effects have a large influence on the kinetics and thermodynamics of OER.

===Platinum===
[[Platinum]] has been a widely studied material for OER because it is the catalytically most active element for this reaction.&lt;ref&gt;H. Dau, C. Limberg, T. Reier, M. Risch, S. Roggan, P. Strasser, ChemCatChem 2010, 2, 724–761.&lt;/ref&gt; It exhibits [[exchange current density]] values on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Much of the mechanistic knowledge of OER was gathered from studies on platinum and its oxides.&lt;ref name="Birss1"/&gt; It was observed that there was a lag in the evolution of oxygen during electrolysis. Therefore, an oxide film must first form at the surface before OER begins.&lt;ref name="Birss1"/&gt; The Tafel slope, which is related to the kinetics of the electrocatalytic reaction, was shown to be independent of the oxide layer thickness at low current densities but becomes dependent on oxide thickness at high current densities &lt;ref&gt;Birss, V. I., Damjanovic, A. J. Electrochem. Soc. 134, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iridium oxide===
[[Iridium oxide]] (IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the industry standard OER catalyst used in [[polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis]] due to its high stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rakousky |first1=C. |last2=Keeley |first2=G.P. |last3=Wippermann |first3=K. |last4=Carmo |first4=M. |last5=Stolten |first5=D. |title=The stability challenge on the pathway to high-current-density polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzers |journal=Electrochim.

===Ruthenium oxide===
[[Ruthenium oxide]] (RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) shows some of the best performance as an OER material in acidic environments. It has been studied since the early 1970s as a water oxidation catalyst with one of the lowest reported overpotentials for OER at the time.&lt;ref&gt;S. Trasatti and G. Buzzanca, J. Electroanal. Chem. 29 (1971), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been investigated for OER in Ru(110) single crystal oxide surfaces,&lt;ref&gt;P. Castelli, S. Trasatti, F. H. Pollak, W. E. O’Grady, J. Electroanal. Chem. 1986, 210, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; compact films,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1978"&gt;G. Lodi, E. Sivieri, A. D. Battisti, S. Trasatti, J. Appl. Electrochem. 1978, 8, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titanium]] supported films.&lt;ref&gt;S. Trasatti, Electrochim. Acta 2000, 45, 2377.&lt;/ref&gt; RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; films can be prepared by thermal decomposition of [[ruthenium chloride]] on inert substrates.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1978"/&gt;

===Lithium-magnesium ferrite===
nanoporous lithium-magnesium ferrite pellet along with two electrodes, zinc as an anode and silver as an inert cathode, immersed in ion free water within a glass container.&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Kotnala and Jyoti Shah, [[International Journal of Energy Research]], 2016, 40, 1652–1661.&lt;/ref&gt; Spontaneous chemidissociation of water molecules into [[hydronium]] and [[hydroxide]] ions occurs at the defective surface of lithium substituted magnesium ferrite. Hydronium ions get trapped inside nanopores of ferrite that generate enough electrostatic fields to dissociate further water molecules into ions. Hydroxide ions instantly forms zinc hydroxide at the zinc electrode&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=Jyoti|last2=Kumar Kotnala|first2=Ravinder|title=Rapid green synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles using a hydroelectric cell without an electrolyte|journal=Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids|date=September 2017|volume=108|pages=15–20|doi=10.1016/j.jpcs.2017.04.007|bibcode=2017JPCS..108...15S}}&lt;/ref&gt;, releasing two electrons at the site of oxidation, the anode. The electrons are collected on another silver electrode at the site of reduction, the cathode, which converts hydronium ions into hydrogen gas and water. There is a net flow of current in the cell which can be used to do work. The reaction mechanism of the cell is expressed as:

* On nanoporous Li-magnesium ferrite: 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
* Anode reaction: Zn +2OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; = Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Eoxd = -0.76 V
* Cathode reaction: 2H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e- =H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) +2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Ered=+0.22 V

The overall HEC voltage is Ecell = 0.22 + 0.76 = 0.98 V

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2212">An '''inertia damper''' is a device that counters or [[Damping|damp]]s the effects of [[inertia]] and other forces and motion. The damper does not negate the forces but either absorbs or redirects them by other means. For example, a large suspended mass may be used to absorb several short-duration large forces, and to reapply those forces as a smaller force over a longer period.

The phrase ''inertial damper'' is actually misused in [[science fiction]] to describe a device that negates inertia and removes it from surrounding [[mass]]. It is more properly described as [[inertia negation]].

== Real-world applications and devices ==

Inertial compensators are also used in simulators or rides, making them more realistic by creating artificial sensations of acceleration and other movement.  The Disneyland ride “Star Tours: The Adventure Continues” is a fair example of this principle.

There are many types of physical devices that can act as inertia dampers:
* [[Sailing ballast|Ballast]]
* [[Brakes]] - kinetic energy redirected as heating due to friction between surfaces pressed together
* [[Counterweight]] - a mass which by mechanical means is caused to move in opposition to the motion of some other mass, partially negating forces such as gravity, that are acting upon the primary mass
* [[Dogbone damper]] - absorbs resonant wave motions in wire and support cables
* [[Flywheel]] - rotational forces
* [[Pendulum]] - oscillatory forces
* [[Shock absorber]] - motion redirected as heating of viscous oil forced through a restrictive passage
* [[Rotary damper]] - rotary motion is dissipated as heat in a highly viscous fluid or gel. May use a smooth surface rotating cylinder and a smooth surface stationary interior wall with fluid/gel between. For more forceful motion absorption and higher surface area, a paddle wheel or toothed gear is used, with a similarly ribbed or studded stationary interior wall to more forcefully grip the fluid/gel. &lt;ref&gt;Lin Engineering: http://www.linengineering.com/line/contents/stepmotors/Nema17_Damper.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phytron: ftp://ftp.phytron.de/phytron-usa/equipment/damper/dmp-us.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:ICR building.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Institute for Creation Research in [[Santee, CA]].]]
The origins of the ICR can be traced to the Creation Science Research Center set up by [[Henry M. Morris]], along with Nell and Kelly Segraves, at the Christian Heritage College (now [[San Diego Christian College]]) in 1970. However, the Segraveses and Morris disagreed on the focus of the center, with the Segraveses favoring political and promotional activities, whilst Morris favored educational and scientific efforts. This led to the breakup of the center in 1972, with the Segraveses taking control of the center and severing ties with the university, with Morris reorganising the remaining staff into the Institute for Creation Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006| pp = 313–315}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICR defined its work in terms of three ministries: research, writing and speaking. Historian of science [[Ronald L. Numbers]] states that "[d]espite its name, the institute for years conducted little research outside the confines of its modest library" and cites (founding member) [[Duane Gish]] as "explain[ing] apologetically in 1978, [that]  the staff devoted much of its research effort to scouring the scientific literature for references favorable to creationism." Numbers does note that it engaged in a number of archaeological and geological expeditions, including two in [[Searches for Noah's Ark|search]] of the [[Mythology|mythical]] [[Noah's Ark]], with geologist Steven A. Austin, working as an "off and on" visiting scientist until taking a full staff position in 1979, single-handedly conducting most of its non-literary research.&lt;ref name=Num315&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influential scientific creationist Walter E. Lammerts complained that "[t]he main trouble is that Henry looks at this whole thing as a sort of 'missionary' effort rather than a scientific one."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=315–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It maintained tax-exempt status as a religious institution carrying out "non-scientific research."&lt;ref name=Flank&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Flank | first1 = Lenny | title = Deception by Design: The Intelligent Design Movement in America | date = | publisher = Red and Black Publishers | location = | isbn = 0-9791813-0-5 | page = 70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s the ICR severed its ties with Christian Heritage College to downplay its religious connections and portray itself as secular scientific institution.&lt;ref name=Flank/&gt; [[Ken Ham]], a speaker and former high school science teacher in Australia,&lt;ref name=racm9&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trollinger |first1=Susan L. |last2=Trollinger, Jr. |first2=William Vance |title=Righting America at the Creation Museum |publisher=JHU Press |year=2016 |isbn=9781421419534 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOf-CwAAQBAJ |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; once worked for the ICR producing a series of seminars "Back to Genesis".&lt;ref name="Numbers 401"&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Ham left ICR to found what would become [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG).&lt;ref name="Numbers 401"/&gt; Currently, at least one ICR staff member is also on staff at AiG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/bios/a_snelling.asp Andrew Snelling biography], [[Answers in Genesis]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the ICR helped [[Education in Turkey|Turkey’s education minister]] Vehbi Dinçerler, introduce Islamic creationism in [[Turkey|Turkish]] high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/domestic/11102743.asp?gid=244 | title=Turkey evolves as creationist center | publisher=[[Hürriyet|Hurriyet Daily News]] |date= February 27, 2009 | first=Sevim | last=Songün | accessdate =2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the ICR's statement of belief was cited in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling of [[Edwards v. Aguillard]]. Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]] wrote that "If no valid secular purpose can be identified, then the statute violates the [[Establishment Clause]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html#POWELLI | title=Edwards v.

In 2007, the institute relocated from [[Santee, California|Santee]], California, to Dallas, Texas.&lt;ref name = ncseicr&gt;{{cite news |title= ICR seeks to grant degrees in Texas |url= http://ncse.com/news/2007/12/icr-seeks-to-grant-degrees-texas-001147 |publisher= National Center for Science Education |date= 2007-12-21 |accessdate=2008-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris, who died the previous year, said the move was intended to give the ICR a central national location, Dallas' proximity to a major airport, and a larger population for their ministry.&lt;ref name=TCS&gt;{{Cite journal

==Research and publications==
{{Creationism2}}
In a 1995 review of work published by ICR researchers, [[Douglas J. Futuyma]] writes, "Neither in the creationist literature nor in the scientific literature have I found any reference to professional research by these individuals in genetics, paleontology, taxonomy, anatomy, or any of the other fields most relevant to the study of evolution."  He found their work most often published instead by an overtly religious publishing house, [[Creation-Life Publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Science on Trial: The Case for Evolution |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas J. |publisher=Sinauer |year=1995 |pages=8–9 |isbn=978-0-87893-184-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute also publishes a monthly magazine [[Acts and Facts]] devoted to articles "dealing with creation, evolution, and related topics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Acts and Facts Magazine |publisher=Institute for Creation Research |accessdate= October 19, 2017 |url=http://www.icr.org/icr-magazines/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the ICR is primarily distributed through religious settings as well as before public audiences in live debates with scientists and other supporters of biological evolution.

ICR launched the [[Vision Forum#Jonathan Park|Jonathan Park]] radio drama series based on a book of the same title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Acts and Facts Magazine |title=ICR Radio Adventure Jonathan Park and the Mystery of the Hidden Cave |date=May 2000 |issue=5 |volume=29 |url=http://www.icr.org/i/pdf/af/af0005.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the radio program was transferred to [[Vision Forum Ministries]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visionforum.com/news/blogs/doug/2005/05/1107/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205174912/http://www.visionforum.com/news/blogs/doug/2005/05/1107/ |archive-date=February 5, 2013 |title=What is Jonathan Park? |author=Doug Phillips |date=May 16, 2005 |work=Doug's Blog |publisher=Vision Forum |accessdate=6 April 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Master Books==
Master Books is a division within Creation-Life Publishers, another enterprise Morris helped to found.  It serves as the publishing arm of the Institute for Creation Research, and specializes in theology and creation science works.  Master Books' anti-evolution books are in wide distribution, promoted by most of the large creationist organizations as well as the ICR.&lt;ref name=evsc&gt;{{cite book |last= Scott |first= Eugenie |authorlink= Eugenie Scott |title= Evolution vs. Creationism: An Introduction |year= 2004 |publisher= Greenwood Press |location=Westport Connecticut-London |isbn= 0-313-32122-1 |oclc= 54752786 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School and accreditation==

In June 1981, the ICR received formal state approval in California to offer degree programs, and its first graduate level courses were taught in the summer of that year.&lt;ref name="ICRHistory"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.icr.org/discover/index/discover_history/ | title = Institute for Creation Research-History | work = Institute for Creation Research | accessdate = November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=317–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the ICR sought re-approval. A five-person committee from the [[California Department of Education]] sent to evaluate ICR's degree program found its graduate school consisted of only five full-time faculty and some courses were videotaped rather than professor-led instruction. The committee failed to grant re-approval by 3–2 vote, a move the ICR attributed to "religious intolerance" rather than criticisms of the quality of education it provided.&lt;ref name="Numbers 2006 318"/&gt; This resulted in [[California State Superintendent of Public Instruction|California's State Superintendent of Public Instruction]] barring the institute from granting master's degrees in science, which encompassed their existing graduate degree programs in the teaching of biology, geology, astrogeophysics and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= California Bars Degrees at Creationist School | author=[[Sandra Blakeslee]] | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DB1638F93BA35751C1A96E948260 | publisher=New York Times | date=1988-12-08 | accessdate=2007-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICR filed a lawsuit against California's State Superintendent, [[Bill Honig]], and was awarded a settlement of $225,000 and given permission to continue its program until 1995 so long as it continued to teach evolution alongside creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Delos B. McKown |title=The Mythmaker's Magic |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original agreement expired in 1995, and [[California Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education]] (BPPVE) granted the ICR religious exemption from [[secondary school|postsecondary school]] requirements in California.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to California Colleges and Universities-Institute For Creation Research, Retrieved on 2007-11-26 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070818184624/http://www.cpec.ca.gov/collegeguide/Institution.asp?id=E0380A&amp;bhcp=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the ICR received accreditation from the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]] (TRACS). According to Morris, TRACS and ICR founder, TRACS is a "product of the ICR Graduate School" and was created "Because of the prejudice against creation-science, outspoken creationist schools such as ICRGS used to stand little or no chance of getting recognition through accreditation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= The ICR Graduates | author=Sandra Blakeslee | url=http://www.icr.org/article/495/ | publisher=Institute for Creation Research | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TRACS was officially recognized as an accreditor by the US Department of Education in 1991. Following the ICR's move to Dallas, in November 2007, TRACS terminated its accredited status after the ICR requested its termination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tracs.org/DOE_Nov07.pdf |title=Accreditation Commission Meeting |accessdate=2008-01-09 |format=PDF |work=Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511210411/http://www.tracs.org/DOE_Nov07.pdf |archivedate=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas does not recognize TRACS' accreditation.&lt;ref name=TCS/&gt;

The ICR's relocation to Texas required Texas state approval or accreditation by a [[regional accreditation|regional accrediting agency]], in this case [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS).&lt;ref name = jaschik/&gt; In 2007, the ICR applied for a temporary state certification there which would have allowed the institute to operate while it pursues accreditation through SACS.&lt;ref name=mysa&gt;{{cite news|first=Melissa |last=Ludwig |title=Institute proposes online degrees in creationism |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA121907.01A.Creationism.2951a43.html |publisher=Express News |location=San Antonio |date=2007-12-19 |accessdate=2008-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207185419/http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA121907.01A.Creationism.2951a43.html |archivedate=2008-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, the [[Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board]] (THECB) received an advisory committee recommendation to allow the ICR to start offering online master's degrees in [[science education]].

The Board originally planned to decide on the issue at their January 2008 meeting.&lt;ref name = jaschik&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.insidehighered.com/layout/set/print/news/2007/12/17/texas |title= Creationist College advances in Texas |accessdate=2008-01-04 |last= Jaschik |first= Scott |date= 2007-12-17 |publisher=Inside Higher Ed }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it applied, ICR graduate school had approximately 30 to 50 students, most teachers from private Christian schools or home-schoolers, and four full-time faculty.&lt;ref name= dallas/&gt;&lt;ref name="austin "/&gt;&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite news |title= Texas-Based Creationism Institute Seeks to Offer Science Education Degree |url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,317533,00.html |publisher= Fox News |date= 2007-12-19 |accessdate=2008-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seeking the advice from an independent panel, the Chairman of the Texas Board requested information about the research conducted by the faculty, how an on-line program would expose students to the experimental side of science, and asked why "[t]heir curriculum doesn't line up very well with the curriculum available in conventional master of science programs."&lt;ref name="ncse.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/news/2008/01/decision-icrs-graduate-school-deferred-001690 | title=Decision on ICR's graduate school deferred | publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |date= January 17, 2008 | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the ICR asked the THECB to delay its decision until their next meeting, on April 24, 2008 to give them time to respond.&lt;ref name="ncse.com"/&gt; [[Inside Higher Ed]] reported "lobbying — by scientists against the institute, and by others in its favor — is going strong."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/01/25/qt ''[[Inside Higher Ed]],''] January 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The [[Dallas Morning News]]'' obtained some of the messages sent to the board and published a number of examples and summaries that illustrated how intense the debate had become.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/012408dnmetcreation.2bd704c.html "Creationist institute's master's science degree proposal creates debate,"] ''Dallas Morning News,'' January 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the response from the ICR to the Board, Steven Schafersman, of the [[Texas Citizens for Science]], reported that the ICR sent out "prayer requests" and is currently arguing a creationist derived distinction of science in their application for approval.&lt;ref name="texscience.org"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.texscience.org/reviews/icr-duality-science.htm |title=The Disjunctive Duality of Science Distinction |publisher=[[Texas Citizens for Science]] |date=January 15, 2008 |first=Steven |last=Schafersman |accessdate=2008-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119224010/http://www.texscience.org/reviews/icr-duality-science.htm |archivedate=January 19, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2008, education board's Academic Excellence and Research Committee [[unanimous]]ly voted against allowing the ICR to issue science degrees citing "the institute’s program is infused with creationism and runs counter to conventions of science that hold that claims of supernatural intervention are not testable and therefore lie outside the realm of science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Panel rejects creation institute's proposal |url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/highereducation/entries/2008/04/23/panel_rejects_creation_institu.html |publisher=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |date=April 22, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608050448/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/highereducation/entries/2008/04/23/panel_rejects_creation_institu.html |archivedate=June 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day the full Board unanimously voted against allowing the ICR to issue science degrees. The decision was "based the recommendation on two considerations:
# ICR failed to demonstrate that the proposed degree program meets acceptable standards of science and science education.
#The proposed degree is inconsistent with Coordinating Board rules which require the accurate labeling or designation of programs … Since the proposed degree program inadequately covers key areas of science, it cannot be properly designated either as 'science' or 'science education.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ICR fails to obtain certification in Texas |url=http://ncse.com/news/2008/04/icr-fails-to-obtain-certification-texas-001688 |publisher= [[National Center for Science Education]] |date= April 24, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Scientific criticism===
Young-earth creationism is rejected by nearly all scientists, including most scientists who hold to Christian faith &lt;ref name="Newsweek 1987 Martz McDaniel"&gt;As reported by [[Newsweek]]:  "By one count there are some 700 [[scientist]]s (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give credence to [[creation science|creation-science]], the general theory that complex life forms did not evolve but appeared 'abruptly'," in "Keeping [[God]] out of the Classroom ([[Washington DC|Washington]] and bureau reports)",

Pigliucci notes that any research conducted within the ICR's policy framework is prescribed at the outset by [[Biblical literalism]], and thus antithetical to the methods and [[scientific method|framework used by scientists]].&lt;ref name=Pigliucci&gt;{{cite book |last=Pigliucci | first = Massimo | authorlink = Massimo Pigliucci |title= Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scientism, and the Nature of Science |publisher=Sinauer |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |year= 2002 |isbn=0-87893-659-9 |oclc= |doi= |page= 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, Pigliucci cites ICR scientist Harold Slusher resorting to [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] and non-Einsteinian explanations of [[speed of light|light travel]] to reconcile the vast distances light travels in space with the brief timescale given in young earth creationism, and the association adopted by the ICR between the second principle of thermodynamics and the Bible's account of the [[fall of Adam]]. Pigliucci further claimed that "some of the historical claims found in the ICR museum are also stunning and show how easily ideology gets the better of accuracy."&lt;ref name=Pigliucci/&gt;

On January 7, 2007 the [[National Center for Science Education]] reported that ''[[Grand Canyon: A Different View]]'', edited by Tom Vail and published by [[Master Books]], the publishing arm of the Institute for Creation Research, and described as promoting "a young-earth creationist view of the geology of the [[Grand Canyon]]," was facing new scrutiny by [[Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility]] (PEER) in December 2006. The Chief of the Park Service's Geologic Resources Division recommended its removal on grounds that it "does not use accurate, professional and scholarly knowledge; is not based on science but a specific religious doctrine; does not further the public's understanding of the Grand Canyon's existence; [and] does not further the mission of the National Park Service".&lt;ref name=ncse&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/rncse/27/3-4/renewed-concern-creationism-at-grand-canyon-national-park | title=Renewed concern about creationism at Grand Canyon National Park | publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] | date= January 7, 2007 | first= | last= | accessdate =2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the National Center for Science Education, written by Chemist [[Karen Bartelt]] was critical of the ICR representatives and displays in the "museum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/rncse/17/6/visit-to-institute-creation-research | title=A Visit to the Institute for Creation Research |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] | year=1998 | first=Eugenie | last=Scott | accessdate = 2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Earth creationism|Old Earth creationists]] are opposed to the ICR. [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]] "opposes the ICR on the grounds that they" think the second principle of [[thermodynamics]] contradicts evolution, and John W. Robbins considers the ICR's activities a "fraud."&lt;ref name=Pigliucci/&gt; The old-Earth creationist organization [[Answers In Creation]] criticizes the ICR,&lt;ref name="AnCreation"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.answersincreation.org/rebuttal/icr/institute_for_creation_research.htm | author=[[Answers In Creation]] | title= Creation Science Rebuttals: Institute for Creation Research | work= | accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a critical review by [[Kevin R. Henke]], Ph.D of the ICR's dating claims.&lt;ref name="Henke"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.answersincreation.org/rebuttal/icr/institute_for_creation_research.htm | author=Kevin R. Henke, Ph.D | title= Young-Earth Creationist 'Dating' of a Mt. St. Helens Dacite: The Failure of Austin and Swenson to Recognize Obviously Ancient Minerals | work=[[Answers In Creation]] | accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henke concluded that the ICR's "research" was improperly conducted and "was unsuccessful in adequately separating the volcanic glass from the much older minerals."&lt;ref name="Henke"/&gt;  Another creationist opponent of ICR and its doctrine is [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], who accepts the scientific consensus of a [[Age of the Earth|4.54 billion year old Earth]] and is critical of ICR's cosmological models as well as their attempts to solve the starlight problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasons.org/resources/apologetics/humphreys_debate_statement.shtml |title=Exchanges Between Dr. Hugh Ross and Dr. Russell Humphreys |accessdate=2008-11-06 |author=Hugh Ross and Russell Humphreys |date=August 2002 |publisher=Reasons to Believe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827181645/http://www.reasons.org/resources/apologetics/humphreys_debate_statement.shtml |archivedate=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icr.org/article/345/ |title=Hugh Ross, ICR, and Facts of Science |accessdate=2008-11-06 |author= James Stambaugh |publisher=ICR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism over awarding degrees===
The ICR attracted much opposition when it sought approval in Texas to operate a master's degree program in science education.&lt;ref name="texscience.org"/&gt; An April 2008 survey by [[Texas Freedom Network]] showed the majority of science faculties in Texas are opposed to ICR's request to issue science degrees with 185 (95% of respondents) opposed to certifying the program and 6 (3%) in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Survey shows overwhelming opposition to ICR certification
 |url= http://ncse.com/news/2008/04/survey-shows-overwhelming-opposition-to-icr-certification-001687 |publisher= [[National Center for Science Education]] |date= April 24, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials of the institute state their goal is to integrate Biblical creationism with science. Since their program is intended to prepare students who are or will become teachers, the developing program is controversial. In public statements ICR officials say that [[scientific literacy]] will be emphasized, but science advocates critical of the ICR say the institute's true goal is to restore religious creationism to science classes in the public schools.

Iron powder is formed as a whole from several other iron particles. The particle sizes vary anywhere from 20-200 [[μm]]. The iron properties differ depending on the production method and history of a specific iron powder. There are three types of iron powder classifications: reduced iron powder, atomized powder, and electrolyte iron powder. Each type is used in various applications depending on their properties. There is very little difference in the visual appearances of reduced iron powder and atomized iron powder.&lt;ref name="JFE Steel Corporation"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is iron powder?|url=http://www.jfe-steel.co.jp/en/products/ironpowders/about.html|publisher=JFE Steel Corporation|accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korean Air flight 8702''', operated by a [[Boeing 747-400]], departed [[Tokyo]], [[Narita International Airport]] on 5 August 1998 at 16:50 for a flight to Seoul, scheduled to arrive there at 19:20. Bad weather, including heavy rainfall, at Seoul forced the flight crew to divert to Jeju. The aircraft took off from [[Jeju City|Jeju]] at 21:07 for [[Seoul]]. The flight was cleared to land on runway 14R with a crosswind component as the wind was from 220 degrees at 22 knots. Upon touchdown, the aircraft rolled off the runway. The aircraft slid into a ditch. The undercarriage was destroyed by the impact and the fuselage split. After the crash, the inside of the aircraft caught fire, but all the occupants were able to evacuate the aircraft.&lt;ref name="harroranter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19980805-0|title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 747-4B5 HL7496 Seoul-Kimpo International Airport (SEL)|author=Harro Ranter|date=5 August 1998|work=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Korea Office of Civil Aviation|KCAB]]'s investigation determined that the accident was caused by the captain's misuse of the thrust reverser during the landing roll and his confusion over crosswind conditions.

At the time of the accident, there were 27 other [[Boeing 747-400]] aircraft in the [[Korean Air]] fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planespotters.net/Airline/Korean-Air-Lines|title=Korean Air Lines Fleet Details and History|work=planespotters.net|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft==
The aircraft involved was a [[Boeing 747-4B5]], registration HL7496 delivered to [[Korean Air]] on 27 June 1996. Two years and two months old, it was the 21st 747-400 delivered to [[Korean Air]] and one of 27 in the fleet at the time of the accident. With line number 1083 and Construction Number (MSN) 26400, it had not been involved in any serious incidents in the time leading up to the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planespotters.net/Production_List/Boeing/747/26400,HL7496-Korean-Air-Lines.php|title=HL7496 Korean Air Lines Boeing 747-400 - cn 26400 / ln 1083|work=planespotters.net|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft involved was the fourth of five [[Boeing 747]]s (2 -200, 1 -300, this -400 and 1 -200F) to be written off by Korean Air in a time lapse of 15 years&lt;ref&gt;[[Korean Air incidents and accidents]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crash==
Korean Air flight 8702 was a scheduled flight from [[Tokyo]], [[Narita International Airport]] to [[Seoul]], [[Gimpo International Airport]]. Due to poor weather, the crew diverted to [[Jeju International Airport]]. Upon landing the aircraft was towed to the main terminal and the passengers temporarily disembarked into the terminal. Two hours later the passengers re-boarded the aircraft for the 1 hour flight back to [[Seoul]]

The aircraft took off from [[Jeju City|Jeju]] at 21:07 for [[Seoul]]. The flight was cleared to land on runway 14R with a crosswind component as the wind was from 220 degrees at 22 knots. Upon touchdown, the captain misused the reverse thrusters in a way the No. 1 engine failed to provide reverse thrust.&lt;ref name="harroranter"/&gt; Coupled with the fact the captain was confused with [[crosswind]] conditions and the first officer was preoccupied and not paying attention to the landing, the 747 failed to stop before the end of the runway. The aircraft swerved to the right and slid into a ditch at 50 knots with the fuselage splitting up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/photos/kor1/photo.shtml|title=AirDisaster.Com: Accident Photo: Korean Air HL-7496|work=airdisaster.com|accessdate=22 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108084419/http://www.airdisaster.com/photos/kor1/photo.shtml|archive-date=2015-01-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lead zirconate titanate''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] [[Lead|Pb]]&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Zirconium|''x''}}{{Titanium|1-''x''}}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Oxygen|3}} (0≤''x''≤1).  Also called '''PZT''', it is a ceramic [[perovskite (structure)|perovskite]] material that shows a marked [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric effect]], meaning that the compound changes shape when an electric field is applied.  It is used in a number of practical applications such as [[ultrasonic transducer]]s and [[Crystal oscillator|piezoelectric resonators]]. It is a white to off-white solid.

PZT was first developed around 1952 at the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]]. Compared to [[Barium titanate]], a previously discovered metallic oxide-based [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] material, PZT exhibit greater sensitivity and has a higher operating temperature. Due to its physical strength, chemical inertness, tailorability, and relatively inexpensive manufacture costs, it is one of the most commonly used piezo ceramics used in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanpiezo.com/piezo-theory/pzt.html|title=What is "PZT"?|last=|first=|date=|website=APC International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electroceramic properties==
Being piezoelectric, PZT develops a [[voltage]] (or potential difference) across two of its faces when compressed (useful for sensor applications), or physically changes shape when an external electric field is applied (useful for actuator applications). The [[Relative permittivity]] of PZT can range from 300 to 3850, depending upon orientation and doping.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Being [[pyroelectric]], this material develops a voltage difference across two of its faces under changing temperature conditions; consequently, PZT can be used as a heat sensor. PZT is also [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]], which means it has a spontaneous [[Polarization density|electric polarization]] ([[Electric dipole moment|electric dipole]]) that can be reversed in the presence of an electric field.

The material features an extremely large relative permittivity at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) near ''x'' = 0.52.&lt;ref name=Rouquette2004&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rouquette |first=J. |last2=Haines |first2=J. |last3=Bornand |first3=V. |last4=Pintard |first4=M. |last5=Papet |first5=Ph |last6=Bousquet |first6=C. |last7=Konczewicz |first7=L. |last8=Gorelli |first8=F.

Some formulations are [[Ohm's Law|ohmic]] until at least 250 kV/cm (25 MV/m), after which current grows exponentially with field strength before reaching [[avalanche breakdown]]; but PZT exhibits time-dependent dielectric breakdown — breakdown may occur under constant-voltage stress after minutes to hours, depending on voltage and temperature, so its dielectric strength depends on the time scale over which it is measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

PZT-based materials are components of [[ultrasound]] [[transducer]]s and [[ceramic]] [[capacitor]]s, [[scanning tunneling microscope|STM]]/[[Atomic force microscopy|AFM]] actuators (tubes).

PZT is used to make [[ultrasound]] [[transducer]]s and other [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s, as well as high-value ceramic [[capacitor]]s and [[Ferroelectric RAM|FRAM]] chips. PZT is also used in the manufacture of [[ceramic resonator]]s for reference timing in electronic circuitry. In 1975 [[Sandia National Laboratories]] created anti-flash goggles featuring PZLT to protect aircrew from burns and blindness in case of a nuclear explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J. Thomas |last=Cutchen |first2=James O. |last2=Harris, Jr. |first3=George R. |last3=Laguna |title=PLZT electrooptic shutters: applications |journal=[[Applied Optics]] |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=1866&amp;ndash;1873 |year=1975 |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/ao/abstract.cfm?URI=ao-14-8-1866 |doi=10.1364/AO.14.001866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PLZT lenses could turn opaque in less than 150 microseconds.

Commercially, it is usually not used in its pure form, rather it is [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] with either acceptors, which create oxygen (anion) vacancies, or donors, which create metal (cation) vacancies and facilitate domain wall motion in the material. In general, acceptor doping creates ''hard'' PZT while donor doping creates ''soft'' PZT. Hard and soft PZT's generally differ in their piezoelectric constants. Piezoelectric constants are proportional to the polarization or to the electrical field generated per unit of mechanical stress, or alternatively is the mechanical strain produced by per unit of electric field applied.  In general, ''soft'' PZT has a higher piezoelectric constant, but larger losses in the material due to [[internal friction]]. In ''hard'' PZT, domain wall motion is pinned by the impurities thereby lowering the losses in the material, but at the expense of a reduced piezoelectric constant.

==Varieties of PZTs==
One of the commonly studied chemical composition is [[Lead|Pb]]{{Zirconium|0.52}}{{Titanium|0.48}}{{Oxygen|3}}. The increased piezoelectric response and poling efficiency near to ''x'' = 0.52 is due to the increased number of allowable domain states at the MPB. At this boundary, the 6 possible domain states from the tetragonal phase [[Miller index#Case of cubic structures|&lt;100&gt;]] and the 8 possible domain states from the rhombohedral phase [[Miller index#Case of cubic structures|&lt;111&gt;]] are equally favorable energetically, thereby allowing a maximum 14 possible domain states.

Like structurally similar [[lead scandium tantalate]] and [[barium strontium titanate]], PZT can be used for manufacture of uncooled [[staring array]] [[infrared imaging]] sensors for [[thermographic camera]]s. Both [[thin film]] (usually obtained by [[chemical vapor deposition]]) and bulk structures are used. The formula of the material used usually approaches Pb&lt;sub&gt;1.1&lt;/sub&gt;(Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (called PZT 30/70). Its properties may be modified by doping it with [[lanthanum]], resulting in '''lanthanum-doped lead zirconium titanate''' ('''PLZT''', also called '''lead lanthanum zirconium titanate'''), with formula Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.83&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;0.17&lt;/sub&gt;(Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0.9575&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PLZT 17/30/70).&lt;ref name=Liu2000&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=W. |last2=Jiang |first2=B. |last3=Zhu |first3=W. |title=Self-biased dielectric bolometer from epitaxially grown Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 and lanthanum-doped Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 multilayered thin films |journal=[[Applied Physics Letters]] |volume=77 |issue=7 |pages=1047–1049 |year=2000 |doi=10.1063/1.1289064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States Agency for International Development. Washington, DC, USA [http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/section_118/Guate_FY2010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the variety of its territory and ecosystems that occur from sea level up to more than 4,000 meters above sea level. [[Ecological niche]]s include (but are not limited to) subtropical and tropical [[rain forests]], [[wetlands]], [[dry forests]], scrublands, [[cloud forests]], pine-fir forests in the highlands. Despite this wealth, however, our knowledge on the mycobiota of the country is very poor.&lt;ref&gt;Comandini O, Erős–Honti Z, Jakucs E, Flores Arzú R, Leonardi M, Rinaldi AC 2012 – Molecular and morpho–anatomical description of mycorrhizas of ''Lactarius rimosellus'' on ''Quercus'' sp., with ethnomycological notes on ''Lactarius'' in Guatemala.

The lack of trained local mycologists has certainly also delayed the detailed investigation of the rich mycota inhabiting the [[Guatemala Biodiversity|highly diversified]] Guatemalan [[biotopes]].

==Diversity of Guatemala macrofungi==

Larger fungi (usually referred to as [[macrofungi]] or macromycetes) are of particular interest because of their importance as food resources and as a component of traditional culture in many places in the world.&lt;ref name=Boa&gt;Boa E 2004 - Wild edible fungi. A global overview of their use and importance to people. FAO. Rome, Italy [http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5489e/y5489e00.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many [[basidiomycetes]] and [[ascomycetes]] with conspicuous [[Sporocarp (fungi)|sporocarps]] often play an important role as [[ectomycorrhizal]] mycobionts of trees and shrubs of boreal forests in the northern hemisphere and are important elements in many areas of the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaldi AC, Comandini O, Kuyper TW 2008 - Ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity: separating the wheat from the chaff. Fungal Diversity 33: 1–45 [http://www.fungaldiversity.org/fdp/sfdp/33-1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Guatemalan macrofungi have not been as yet extensively surveyed, a preliminary checklist encompasses some 350 species of macromycetes (31 ascomycetes and 319 basidiomycetes) occurring in 163 genera and 20 ascomycetous and basidiomycetous orders.&lt;ref name=Flores&gt;Flores Arzú R, Comandini O, Rinaldi AC 2012 - A preliminary checklist of macrofungi of Guatemala, with notes on edibility ad traditional knowledge. Mycosphere 3: 1-21 [http://www.mycosphere.org/pdfs/MC3_1_No1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, 12 species of Ascomicetes where cited, with the new records, there are now 44 ascomycete species known from Guatemala &lt;ref&gt; Medel R., Morales, O., Castillo R, Cáceres R. 2013 - New ascomycete records from Guatemala. Mycotaxon 124:73-85. &lt;/ref&gt;Most available observations pertain to the highlands, in the departments of [[Alta Verapaz]], [[Baja Verapaz]], [[Chimaltenango]], [[Guatemala Department|Guatemala]], [[El Quiché]], [[Huehuetenango]], and [[Quetzaltenango]], while the wide lowland [[Petén Basin|Petén]] region has been scantly explored, despite the fact that it accounts for about one third of Guatemala's area and, together with adjacent areas of [[Belize]] and southern [[Mexico]], comprise the largest unbroken tract of tropical forest north of the [[Brazilian Amazon]]. At the order level, ''[[Agaricales]]'' was found to host the larger number of species (almost one third of the entire set), followed by ''[[Polyporales]]'' and ''[[Boletales]]''. The most represented genera are ''[[Amanita]]'', ''[[Russula]]'', ''[[Lactarius]]'', ''[[Laccaria]]'', ''[[Suillus]]''.&lt;ref name=Flores/&gt; Intriguingly, all these genera are ectomycorrhizal with the several ''[[Pinus]]'' and ''[[Quercus]]'' species that form extensive pine and mixed forests of the highlands, and/or with the endangered ''[[Abies guatemalensis]]'' (pinabete), most abundant between 2800–3200 m elevation on the [[Sierra de los Cuchumatanes]] in western Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Vivero JL, Szejner M, Gordon J, Magin V 2006 - The red list of trees of Guatemala.

==Traditional knowledge and use==

“The Mesoamerican tradition of eating wild edible fungi continues from Mexico to west Guatemala then is absent from much of [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]], even though both contain forest areas that in theory support production of edible fungi,” remarked Eric Boa in his reference volume on worldwide wild edible fungi.&lt;ref name=Boa/&gt;

[[File:Hongos en mercado San Juan Sacatepéquez.jpg|thumb|A 'medida' of mixed edible mushrooms on sale in the San Juan Sacatepéquez market]]

Indeed, the deep mycophily of Guatemalan indigenous people is apparent. [[Ethnomycology|Ethnomycological]] surveys conducted in the highlands, mainly through visits to local markets and interviews with vendors, revealed that some 130 species were identified as edible species, most of which actually sold in markets or along roadsides.&lt;ref name=Flores/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommerkamp Y 1990 - Hongos comestibles en los mercados de Guatemala. Dirección General de Investigación-DIGI. Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala. Guatemala City, Guatemala &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bran MC, Morales O, Cáceres R, Flores R 2003 – Contribución al conocimiento de los hongos comestibles de Guatemala. IIQB–USAC. Revista Científica, special issue [http://mushroom.uark.edu/publications/moralesetal2003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Species of edible mushrooms belonging to different genera (e.g., ''Amanita'', ''Lactarius'', ''[[Helvella]]'') are often offered mixed together, and sold in form of ‘medida’, i.e. a fixed amount, which equals the content of a small basket. However, the more popular and valuable species are usually sold separately. ''[[Lactarius deliciosus]]'' and [[Lactarius indigo|''L. indigo'']] – known as ‘Shara’ (or ‘Xara’) ‘amarilla’ and ‘Shara’ (or ‘Xara’) ‘azul’, respectively, or ‘Cabeza de Xara’ in local Spanish (Sharas, also known as ‘urracas’, are birds, variously coloured, living in different parts of the country) – ''[[Amanita caesarea]]'' complex (hongo de San Juan), and ''[[Cantharellus cibarius]]'' (anacate), are among the most appreciated [[edible mushrooms]] among Guatemalan [[Maya people]]. ''Daldinia fissa'' is recorded as a common edible ascomycete from the municipality of Tecpán, Department of Chimaltenango. The mushroom is named as “tzan tz’i” in Kaqchikel dialect, that means “dog nose ” or “chucho nose” because of ascostroma shape. &lt;ref&gt;Morales O, Medel R, Guzmán G 2006 -Primer registro de la comestibilidad de una especie de ''Daldinia'' (Ascomycota). Revista Mexicana de Micología 23: 103-105.&lt;/ref&gt; Many, but by no means all, edible species are identified through common vernacular names that have been sometimes recorded in several [[Maya languages]].&lt;ref name=Flores/&gt; Generally, mushrooms are gathered and sold by women, often in family groups spanning three generations. Localities with more traditional knowledge, based on the number of
species are used, were Tecpán (Chimaltenango) with 31 species, followed by San Juan Comalapa (Chimaltenango)and Totonicapán city (Totonicapán), with 22 species each. The collection of wild edible fungi is done throughout the year and the main forms used for marketing were the "medida", "unidad", "Libra" and "manojo", being subject to their species or group of species in question use. &lt;ref&gt;Morales O, Bran M, Cáceres R 2010 -Los hongos comestibles de uso tradicional en Guatemala.

Red Latinoamericana de Hongos Comestibles y Medicinales-COLPOS-UNSCONACYT-AMC-UAEM-UPAEP-IMINAP, Puebla, México. &lt;/ref&gt; The use of macrofungi in Guatemala other than for human consumption is limited to a few instances, such as for wound healing and for preventing infections (spores and dried mycelia of ''[[Calvatia]]'' ''lilacina'' and ''C. cyathiformis''), cicatrizing substances to treat burns in children (sporocarps of ''[[Geastrum]]'' and ''[[Lycoperdon]]''), to heal and disinfect wounds and to treat bee stings (dried specimens of ''Lycoperdon marginatum'').&lt;ref name=Flores/&gt;

==IWEMM-7 in Guatemala==

Guatemala hosted the 7th International Workshop on Edible Ectomycorrhizal Mushrooms (IWEMM-7). Held in the beautiful colonial city of Antigua, from July 29 to August 3, 2013, the congress convened researchers from worldwide institutions to discuss the most recent information about diversity, cultivation and production of wild edible mycorrhizal mushrooms. Several talks also dealt with the current status of knowledge on macrofungi in Guatemala and their traditional use.

'''Mallite''' is a type of [[laminate]] [[composite material]], formerly manufactured by the ''William Mallinson &amp; Sons'' company. The material is formed of a core sheet of [[Wood grain|end grain]] [[balsa]] wood, faced by [[duralumin]] sheets. This construction endows the finished material with greater strength and rigidity than a light alloy sheet of equal mass. The material was originally developed in the late 1950s for use in the aerospace industry, primarily for use in flooring and internal partitioning in jet [[airliner]] construction. However, it found fame as one of the first engineered composite materials to be employed in the motorsport industry. [[Robin Herd]], formerly a designer on the [[Concorde]] project, used his aerospace knowledge to design the first [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]] single-seater racing cars. The M2A prototype used Mallite extensively, throughout its construction. The final production model, the [[Formula One]] [[McLaren M2B]] of 1966, only used Mallite for its internal skins and lower bodywork; a lack of understanding of the material's properties had led the team to design the car with conventional curved bodywork, creating problems during the fabrication process as the inherently inflexible material would not readily conform to complex, compound curvatures. With greater understanding of Mallite's properties Herd later used the material to construct the unraced [[Cosworth]] [[four-wheel drive]] [[Formula One]] car of 1969, noted for its slab-sided, angular looks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9050">'''Mechanics of gelation''' describes processes relevant to [[sol-gel process]].

In a static sense, the fundamental difference between a liquid and a solid is that the solid has elastic resistance against a shearing stress while a liquid does not. Thus, a simple liquid will not typically support a transverse acoustic [[phonon]], or [[shear wave]]. Gels have been described by Born as liquids in which an elastic resistance against shearing survives, yielding both viscous and elastic properties. It has been shown theoretically that in a certain low-frequency range, polymeric gels should propagate shear waves with relatively low damping. The distinction between a sol (solution) and a gel therefore appears to be understood in a manner analogous to the practical distinction between the elastic and plastic deformation ranges of a metal. The distinction lies in the ability to respond to an applied shear force via macroscopic viscous flow.&lt;ref&gt;Born, M., ''The Stability of Crystal Lattices'', J. Chem. Phys., Vol. 7, p. 591 9(1939); Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., Vol. 36, p. 160 (1940).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Gennes, P. G. and Pincus, P., J. de Chim. Phys., Vol. 64, p. 616 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a dynamic sense, the response of a gel to an alternating force (oscillation or vibration) will depend upon the period or frequency of vibration. As indicated here, even most simple liquids will exhibit some elastic response at shear rates or frequencies exceeding 5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cycles per second. Experiments on such short time scales probe the fundamental motions of the primary particles (or particle clusters) which constitute the lattice structure or aggregate. The increasing resistance of certain liquids to flow at high stirring speeds is one manifestation of this phenomenon. The ability of a condensed body to respond to a mechanical force by viscous flow is thus strongly dependent on the time scale over which the load is applied, and thus the frequency and amplitude of the stress wave in oscillatory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Philippoff, W. in ''Physical Acoustics'', Ed. W. P. Mason, Vol. 28 (Academic Press, NY 1965).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, E. A. and Reed, G. E., J. Phys. Chem., Vol. 40, p. 1161 (1936), Vol. 41, p. 911 (1937).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural relaxation===
The structural relaxation of a [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] gel has been identified as primary mechanism responsible for densification and associated pore evolution in both colloidal and polymeric silica gels.&lt;ref name="CJ"&gt;{{cite book |first=C. J. |last=Brinker |author2=G. W. Scherer |title=Sol-Gel Science: The Physics and Chemistry of Sol-Gel Processing |publisher=Academic Press |year=1990 |isbn=0-12-134970-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments in the viscoelastic properties of such skeletal networks on various time scales require a force varying with a period (or frequency) appropriate to the relaxation time of the phenomenon investigated, and inversely proportional to the distance over which such relaxation occurs. High frequencies associated with ultrasonic waves have been used extensively in the handling of polymer solutions, liquids and gels and the determination of their viscoelastic properties. Static measurements of the shear modulus have been made,&lt;ref&gt;Walter, A. T., J. Polymer Sci., Vol. 13, p. 207 (1954).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as dynamic measurements of the speed of propagation of shear waves,&lt;ref&gt;Ferry, J. D., ''et al.'', Rev. Sci Instr., Vol. 112, p. 79 (1941); J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 64, p. 1323 (1942); Vol. 70, p. 2244 (1948); J. Coll. Sci., Vol. 9, p. 224 (1953); J. Polymer Sci., Vol. 5, p. 195 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beltman, H., and Lyklema, J., Farad. Disc. Chem. Soc., Vol. 57, p. 92 9(1974).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gettings, W. J., ''et al.'', J. Chem. Soc., Farad, Trans. II, Vol. 74, p. 1246 (1978), Vol. 78, p. 1661 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, A. M. and Geissler, E., J. de Phys., Vol. 39, p. 631 (1978); Macromolecules, Vol. 13, p. 1276 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; which yields the dynamic [[modulus of rigidity]]. [[Dynamic light scattering]] (DLS) techniques have been utilized in order to monitor the dynamics of density fluctuations through the behavior of the [[autocorrelation function]] near the point of gelation.

===Phase transition===
Tanaka ''et al''., emphasize that the discrete and reversible volume transitions which occur in partially hydrolyzed acrylimide gels can be interpreted in terms of a [[phase transition]] of the system consisting of the charged [[polymer]] network, hydrogen (counter)ions and liquid matrix. The phase transition is a manifestation of competition among the three forces which contribute to the [[osmotic pressure]] in the gel:
# The positive osmotic pressure of (+) [[hydrogen ion]]s
# The negative pressure due to polymer-polymer affinity
# The rubber-like [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the polymer network
The balance of these forces varies with change in temperature or [[solvent]] properties. The total [[osmotic pressure]] acting on the system is the sum osmotic pressure of the gel. It is further shown that the phase transition can be induced by the application of an [[electric field]] across the gel. The volume change at the transition point is either discrete (as in a first-order [[Ehrenfest]] transition) or continuous (second order Ehrenfest analogy), depending on the degree of ionization of the gel and on the solvent composition.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, T., Phys. Rev., Vol. A17, p. 763 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, T., Sci. Amer., Vol. 244, p. 124 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, T., Hocker, L. O. and Benedek, G. B., J. Chem. Phys., Vol. 59, p. 5151 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, T., ''et al.'', PRL, Vol. 38, p.722 (1977); Vol. 40, p. 820 (1978); Vol. 42, p. 23 (1979); Vol. 45, p. 1936 (1980); Science, Vol. 218, p.467 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elastic continuum===
The gel is thus interpreted as an elastic continuum, which deforms when subjected to externally applied shear forces, but is incompressible upon application of hydrostatic pressure. This combination of fluidity and rigidity is explained in terms of the gel structure: that of a liquid contained within a fibrous polymer network or matrix by the extremely large friction between the liquid and the fiber or polymer network. Thermal fluctuations may produce infinitesimal expansion or contraction within the network, and the evolution of such fluctuations will ultimately determine the molecular morphology and the degree of hydration of the body.

Quasi-elastic light scattering offers direct experimental access to measurement of the wavelength and lifetimes of critical fluctuations, which are governed by the [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] properties of the gel. It is reasonable to expect a relationship between the [[amplitude]] of such fluctuations and the [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the network. Since the elasticity measures the resistance of the network to either [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] (reversible) or [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] (irreversible) deformation, the fluctuations should grow larger as the elasticity declines. The divergence of the [[scattered radiation|scattered]] light intensity at a finite critical temperature implies that the elasticity approaches zero, or the [[compressibility]] becomes infinite, which is the typically observed behavior of a system at the point of instability. Thus, at the critical point, the polymer network offers no resistance at all to any form of deformation.

===Ultimate microstructure===
The rate of [[relaxation (physics)|relaxation]] of density fluctuations will be rapid if the restoring force, which depends upon the network elasticity, is large—and if the friction between the network and the interstitial fluid is small. The theory suggests that the rate is directly proportional to the elasticity and inversely proportional to the frictional force. The friction in turn depends upon both the viscosity of the fluid and the average size of the pores contained within the polymer network.

Thus, if the elasticity is inferred from the measurements of the scattering intensity, and the viscosity is determined independently (via mechanical methods such as ultrasonic attenuation) measurement of the relaxation rate yields information on the pore size distribution contained within the polymer network, e.g. large fluctuations in polymer density near the critical point yield large density differentials with a corresponding bimodal distribution of porosity. The difference in average size between the smaller pores (in the highly dense regions) and the larger pores (in regions of lower average density) will therefore depend upon the degree of phase separation which is allowed to occur before such fluctuations become thermally arrested or "frozen in" at or near the critical point of the transition.

'''Octol''' is a melt-castable, [[Explosive material|high explosive]] mixture consisting of [[HMX]] and [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] in different weight proportions.

==Composition==
Two formulations are commonly used:
* 70% HMX &amp; 30% TNT
* 75% HMX &amp; 25% TNT

Given that HMX has a much higher [[detonation velocity]] than TNT (over 2,000 metres per second faster) and forms the main part of this explosive blend, the [[brisance]] characteristics of Octol can be inferred.

==Applications==
The applications of Octol are generally military; e.g., [[shaped charge]]s and warheads used in [[guided missile]]s and [[submunitions]]. Octol is somewhat more expensive than [[RDX]]-based explosives, such as [[Composition B]] and [[Cyclotol]]. The advantage of Octol is that it significantly reduces the size and weight of the explosive charge required. These are important considerations where [[smart weapon]]s such as guided missiles are concerned.  A light (but effective) warhead means a superior [[power to weight]] ratio. This in turn results in a higher velocity missile with a longer range and shorter flight time. As a result, the target has less opportunity to recognise and evade the attack.

==Alternative names==
Octol is also referred to as '''Oktol''', particularly in Eastern Europe.

'''Photoluminescence''' (abbreviated as '''PL''') is [[light]] emission from any form of matter after the absorption of [[photons]] (electromagnetic radiation). It is one of many forms of [[luminescence]] (light emission) and is initiated by [[photoexcitation]] (i.e. photons that excite electrons to a higher energy level in an atom), hence the prefix ''photo-''.&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC]], [[Compendium of Chemical Terminology]], 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book") (1997). Online corrected version:  (2006–) "[http://goldbook.iupac.org/P04588.html photochemistry]".&lt;/ref&gt; Following excitation various relaxation processes typically occur in which other photons are re-radiated. Time periods between absorption and emission may vary: ranging from short femtosecond-regime for emission involving free-carrier plasma in inorganic semiconductors&lt;ref name="HayesDeveaud2002"&gt;Hayes, G.R.; Deveaud, B. (2002). "Is Luminescence from Quantum Wells Due to Excitons?". ''Physica Status Solidi A'' '''190''' (3): 637–640. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2F1521-396X%28200204%29190%3A3%3C637%3A%3AAID-PSSA637%3E3.0.CO%3B2-7 doi:10.1002/1521-396X(200204)190:3&lt;637::AID-PSSA637&gt;3.0.CO;2-7]&lt;/ref&gt; up to milliseconds for [[Phosphorescence]] processes in molecular systems; and under special circumstances delay of emission may even span to minutes or hours.

Observation of photoluminescence at a certain energy can be viewed as an indication that an electron populated an excited state associated with this transition energy.

While this is generally true in [[atoms]] and similar systems, correlations and other more complex phenomena also act as sources for photoluminescence in [[Many-body problem|many-body systems]] such as semiconductors. A theoretical approach to handle this is given by the [[semiconductor luminescence equations]].

== Forms ==

[[File:Photoluminescence animation.gif|thumb|Schematic for the excitation-relaxation processes of photoluminescence.]]

Photoluminescence processes can be classified by various parameters such as the energy of the exciting photon with respect to the emission.
Resonant excitation describes a situation in which photons of a particular wavelength are absorbed and equivalent photons are very rapidly re-emitted. This is often referred to as [[resonance fluorescence]]. For materials in solution or in the gas [[Phase (matter)|phase]], this process involves electrons but no significant internal energy transitions involving molecular features of the chemical substance between absorption and emission. In crystalline inorganic semiconductors where an electronic [[band structure]] is formed, secondary emission can be more complicated as events may contain both [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] contributions such as resonant [[Rayleigh scattering]] where a fixed phase relation with the driving light field is maintained (i.e. energetically elastic processes where no losses are involved), and [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent]] contributions (or inelastic modes where some energy channels into an auxiliary loss mode),&lt;ref name="Kira1999"&gt;Kira, M.; Jahnke, F.; Koch, S. W. (1999). "Quantum Theory of Secondary Emission in Optically Excited Semiconductor Quantum Wells". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''82''' (17): 3544–3547. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.82.3544 doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.3544]&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter originate, e.g., from the radiative recombination of [[excitons]], [[Coulomb interaction|Coulomb]]-bound electron-hole pair states in solids. Resonance fluorescence may also show significant [[Quantum optics|quantum optical]] correlations.&lt;ref name="Kira1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimble1977"&gt;Kimble, H. J.; Dagenais, M.; Mandel, L. (1977). "Photon Antibunching in Resonance Fluorescence". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''39''' (11): 691–695. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.39.691 doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.39.691]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carmichael1976"&gt;Carmichael, H. J.; Walls, D. F. (1976). "Proposal for the measurement of the resonant Stark effect by photon correlation techniques". ''Journal of Physics B: Atomic and Molecular Physics'' '''9''' (4): L43. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1088%2F0022-3700%2F9%2F4%2F001 doi:10.1088/0022-3700/9/4/001]&lt;/ref&gt;

More processes may occur when a substance undergoes internal energy transitions before re-emitting the energy from the absorption event. Electrons change energy states by either resonantly gaining energy from absorption of a photon or losing energy by emitting photons. In [[chemistry]]-related disciplines, one often distinguishes  between  [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]]. The former is  typically a fast process, yet some amount of the original energy is dissipated so that re-emitted light photons will have lower energy than did the absorbed excitation photons. The re-emitted photon in this case is said to be red shifted, referring to the reduced energy it carries following this loss (as the [[Jablonski diagram]] shows). For phosphorescence, electrons which absorbed photons, undergo [[intersystem crossing]] where they enter into a state with altered [[Spin (physics)|spin]] multiplicity (see [[term symbol]]), usually a [[triplet state]].  Once the excited electron is transferred into this triplet state, electron transition (relaxation) back to the lower singlet state energies is quantum mechanically forbidden, meaning that it happens much more slowly than other transitions.  The result is a slow process of radiative transition back to the singlet state, sometimes lasting minutes or hours. This is the basis for "glow in the dark" substances.

Photoluminescence is an important technique for measuring the purity and crystalline quality of semiconductors such as [[GaN]] and [[InP]] and for quantification of the amount of disorder present in a system.&lt;ref name="entropyalfaraj2017"&gt;Alfaraj, N.; Mitra, S.; Wu, F. ; Ajia, A. A.; Janjua, B.; Prabaswara, A.; Aljefri, R. A.; Sun, H.; Ng, T. K.; Ooi, B. S.; Roqan, I. S.; Li, X. (2017). "Photoinduced entropy of InGaN/GaN p-i-n double-heterostructure nanowires". ''Applied Physics Letters'' '''110''' (16): 161110. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4981252]&lt;/ref&gt;

Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) is a method where the sample is excited with a light pulse and then the decay in photoluminescence with respect to time is measured.  This technique is useful for measuring the [[minority carrier lifetime]] of III-V semiconductors like [[gallium arsenide]] ([[GaAs]]).

== Photoluminescence properties of direct-gap semiconductors ==

In a typical PL experiment, a semiconductor is excited with a light-source that provides photons with an energy larger than the [[bandgap]] energy.
The incoming light excites a polarization that can be described with the [[semiconductor Bloch equations]].&lt;ref name="SQOBook"&gt;Kira, M.; Koch, S. W. (2011). ''Semiconductor Quantum Optics.'' Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0521875097}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haug2009&gt;Haug, H.; Koch, S. W. (2009). ''Quantum Theory of the Optical and Electronic Properties of Semiconductors'' (5th ed.). World Scientific. p. 216. {{ISBN|9812838848}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the photons are absorbed, electrons and holes are formed with finite momenta &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Conduction band|conduction]] and [[valence band]]s, respectively. The excitations then undergo energy and momentum relaxation towards the band gap minimum. Typical mechanisms are [[Coulomb scattering]] and the interaction with [[phonons]]. Finally, the electrons recombine with holes under emission of photons.

Ideal, defect-free semiconductors are [[Many-body problem|many-body systems]] where the interactions of charge-carriers and lattice vibrations have to be considered in addition to the light-matter coupling. In general, the PL properties are also extremely sensitive to internal [[electric fields]] and to the  dielectric environment (such as in [[photonic crystals]]) which impose further degrees of complexity. A precise microscopic description is provided by the [[semiconductor luminescence equations]].&lt;ref name="SQOBook"/&gt;

=== Ideal quantum-well structures ===

An ideal, defect-free semiconductor [[quantum well]] structure is a useful  model system to illustrate the fundamental processes in typical PL experiments. The discussion is based on results published in Klingshirn (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Klingshirn, Claus F. (2012). ''Semiconductor Optics.'' Springer. {{ISBN|978-3-642-28361-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Balkan (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Balkan, Naci (1998). ''Hot Electrons in Semiconductors: Physics and Devices.'' Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0198500580}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictive model structure for this discussion has two confined quantized electronic and two hole [[subband]]s, e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.
The linear [[absorption spectrum]] of such a structure shows the [[exciton]] resonances of the first (e1h1) and the second quantum well subbands (e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as the absorption from the corresponding continuum states and from the barrier.

==== Photoexcitation ====

In general, three different excitation conditions are distinguished: resonant, quasi-resonant, and non-resonant. For the resonant excitation, the central energy of the laser corresponds to the lowest [[exciton]] resonance of the [[quantum well]]. No or only a negligible amount of the excess energy is injected to the carrier system. For these conditions, coherent processes contribute significantly to the spontaneous emission.&lt;ref name="Kira1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KiraJahnke1999"&gt;Kira, M.; Jahnke, F.; Hoyer, W.; Koch, S. W. (1999). "Quantum theory of spontaneous emission and coherent effects in semiconductor microstructures". ''Progress in Quantum Electronics'' '''23''' (6): 189–279. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2FS0079-6727%2899%2900008-7 doi:10.1016/S0079-6727(99)00008-7.]&lt;/ref&gt; The decay of polarization creates excitons directly. The detection of  PL is challenging for resonant excitation as it is difficult to discriminate contributions from the excitation, i.e., stray-light and diffuse scattering from surface roughness. Thus, [[speckle pattern|speckle]] and resonant [[Rayleigh scattering|Rayleigh-scattering]] are always superimposed to the [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent]] emission.

In case of the non-resonant excitation, the structure is excited with some excess energy. This is the typical situation used in most PL experiments as the excitation energy can be discriminated using a [[spectrometer]] or an [[optical filter]].
One has to distinguish between quasi-resonant excitation and barrier excitation.

For quasi-resonant conditions, the energy of the excitation is tuned above the ground state but still below the [[Potential barrier|barrier]] [[absorption edge]], for example, into the continuum of the first subband. The polarization decay for these conditions is much faster than for resonant excitation and coherent contributions to the quantum well emission are negligible. The initial temperature of the carrier system is significantly higher than the lattice temperature due to the surplus energy of the injected carriers. Finally, only the electron-hole plasma is initially created. It is then followed by the formation of excitons.&lt;ref name="KaindlCarnahan2003"&gt;Kaindl, R. A.; Carnahan, M. A.; Hägele, D.; Lövenich, R.; Chemla, D. S. (2003). "Ultrafast terahertz probes of transient conducting and insulating phases in an electron–hole gas". ''Nature'' '''423''' (6941): 734–738. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fnature01676 doi:10.1038/nature01676.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChatterjeeEll2004"&gt;Chatterjee, S.; Ell, C.; Mosor, S.; Khitrova, G.; Gibbs, H.; Hoyer, W.; Kira, M.; Koch, S. W.; Prineas, J.; Stolz, H. (2004). "Excitonic Photoluminescence in Semiconductor Quantum Wells: Plasma versus Excitons". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''92''' (6). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.92.067402 doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.067402.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of barrier excitation, the initial carrier distribution in the quantum well strongly depends on the carrier scattering between barrier and the well.

==== Relaxation ====
Initially, the laser light induces coherent polarization in the sample, i.e., the transitions between electron and hole states oscillate with the laser frequency and a fixed phase. The polarization dephases typically on a sub-100 fs time-scale in case of nonresonant excitation due to  ultra-fast Coulomb- and phonon-scattering.&lt;ref name="ArltSiegner1999"&gt;Arlt, S.; Siegner, U.; Kunde, J.; Morier-Genoud, F.; Keller, U. (1999). "Ultrafast dephasing of continuum transitions in bulk semiconductors". ''Physical Review B'' '''59''' (23): 14860–14863. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevB.59.14860 doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.59.14860.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The dephasing of the polarization leads to creation of populations of electrons and holes in the conduction and the valence bands, respectively. 
The lifetime of the carrier populations is rather long, limited by radiative and non-radiative recombination such as [[Auger recombination]].
During this lifetime a fraction of electrons and holes may form excitons, this topic is still controversially discussed in the literature.
The formation rate depends on the experimental conditions such as lattice temperature, excitation density, as well as on the general material parameters, e.g., the strength of the Coulomb-interaction or the exciton binding energy.

The characteristic time-scales are in the range of hundreds of [[picosecond]]s in GaAs;&lt;ref name="KaindlCarnahan2003" /&gt; they appear to be much shorter in [[Wide bandgap semiconductors|wide-gap semiconductors]].&lt;ref name="UmlauffHoffmann1998"&gt;Umlauff, M.; Hoffmann, J.; Kalt, H.; Langbein, W.; Hvam, J.; Scholl, M.; Söllner, J.; Heuken, M.; Jobst, B.; Hommel, D. (1998). "Direct observation of free-exciton thermalization in quantum-well structures". ''Physical Review B'' '''57''' (3): 1390–1393. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevB.57.1390 doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.57.1390].&lt;/ref&gt;

Directly after the excitation with short (femtosecond) pulses and the quasi-instantaneous decay of the polarization, the carrier distribution is mainly determined by the spectral width of the excitation, e.g., a [[laser]] pulse. The distribution is thus highly non-thermal and resembles a [[Gaussian distribution]], centered at a finite momentum. In the first hundreds of [[femtosecond]]s, the carriers are scattered by phonons, or  at elevated carrier densities via Coulomb-interaction. The carrier system successively relaxes to the [[Fermi–Dirac distribution]] typically within the first picosecond. Finally, the carrier system cools down under the emission of phonons. This can take up to several [[nanoseconds]], depending on the material system, the lattice temperature, and the excitation conditions such as the surplus energy.

Initially, the carrier temperature decreases fast via emission of [[Phonon#Acoustic and optical phonons|optical phonons]]. This is quite efficient due to the comparatively large energy associated with optical phonons, (36meV or 420K in GaAs) and their rather flat dispersion, allowing for a wide range of scattering processes under conservation of energy and momentum. Once the carrier temperature decreases below the value corresponding to the optical phonon energy, [[Phonon#Acoustic and optical phonons|acoustic phonons]] dominate the relaxation. Here, cooling is less efficient due their [[Acoustic dispersion|dispersion]] and small energies and the temperature decreases much slower beyond the first tens of picoseconds.&lt;ref name="KashShah1984"&gt;Kash, Kathleen; Shah, Jagdeep (1984). "Carrier energy relaxation in In0.53Ga0.47As determined from picosecond luminescence studies". ''Applied Physics Letters'' '''45''' (4): 401. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1063%2F1.95235 doi:10.1063/1.95235.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PollandRühle1987"&gt;Polland, H.; Rühle, W.; Kuhl, J.; Ploog, K.; Fujiwara, K.; Nakayama, T. (1987). "Nonequilibrium cooling of thermalized electrons and holes in GaAs/Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As quantum wells". ''Physical Review B'' '''35''' (15): 8273–8276. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevB.35.8273 doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.35.8273.]&lt;/ref&gt; At elevated excitation densities, the carrier cooling is further inhibited by the so-called [[hot-phonon effect]].&lt;ref name="ShahLeite1970"&gt;Shah, Jagdeep; Leite, R.C.C.; Scott, J.F. (1970). "Photoexcited hot LO phonons in GaAs". ''Solid State Communications'' '''8''' (14): 1089–1093. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2F0038-1098%2870%2990002-5 doi:10.1016/0038-1098(70)90002-5.]&lt;/ref&gt; The relaxation of a large number of  hot carriers leads to a high generation rate of optical phonons which exceeds the decay rate into acoustic phonons. This creates a non-equilibrium "over-population" of optical phonons and thus causes their increased reabsorption by the charge-carriers significantly suppressing any cooling. Thus, a system cools slower, the higher the carrier density is.

==== Radiative recombination ====

The emission directly after the excitation is spectrally very broad, yet still centered in the vicinity of the strongest exciton resonance. 
As the carrier distribution relaxes and cools, the width of the PL peak decreases and the emission energy shifts to match the ground state of the exciton (such as an electron) for ideal samples without disorder. The PL spectrum  approaches its quasi-steady-state shape defined by the distribution of electrons and holes. Increasing the excitation density will change the emission spectra. They are dominated by the excitonic ground state for low densities. Additional peaks from higher subband transitions appear as the carrier density or lattice temperature are increased as these states get more and more populated. Also, the width of the main PL peak increases significantly with rising excitation due to excitation-induced dephasing&lt;ref name="WangFerrio1993"&gt;Wang, Hailin; Ferrio, Kyle; Steel, Duncan; Hu, Y.; Binder, R.; Koch, S. W. (1993). "Transient nonlinear optical response from excitation induced dephasing in GaAs". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''71''' (8): 1261–1264. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.71.1261 doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.1261.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the emission peak experiences a small shift in energy due to the Coulomb-renormalization and phase-filling.&lt;ref name="Haug2009" /&gt;

In general, both exciton populations and plasma, uncorrelated electrons and holes, can act as sources for photoluminescence as described in the [[semiconductor-luminescence equations]]. Both yield very similar spectral features  which are difficult to distinguish; their emission dynamics, however, vary significantly. The decay of excitons yields a single-exponential decay function since the probability of their radiative recombination does not depend on the carrier density. The probability of spontaneous emission for uncorrelated electrons and holes, is approximately proportional to the product of electron and hole populations eventually leading to a non-single-exponential decay described by a [[hyperbolic function]].

=== Effects of disorder ===
Real material systems always incorporate disorder. Examples are structural  [[Crystallographic defect|defects]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0022-3727/47/42/423001|arxiv=1405.1261|bibcode=2014JPhD...47P3001L|title= Luminescence associated with stacking faults in GaN|journal=J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys.|volume=47|pages=423001|year=2014|last1=Lähnemann|first1=J.|last2=Jahn|first2=U.|last3=Brandt|first3=O.|last4=Flissikowski|first4=T.|last5=Dogan|first5=P.|last6=Grahn|first6=H.T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the lattice or [[Order and disorder (physics)|disorder]] due to variations of the chemical composition. Their treatment is extremely challenging for microscopic theories due to the lack of detailed knowledge about  perturbations of the  ideal structure. Thus, the influence of the extrinsic effects on the PL is usually addressed phenomenologically.&lt;ref name="BaranovskiiEichmann1998"&gt;Baranovskii, S.; Eichmann, R.; Thomas, P. (1998). "Temperature-dependent exciton luminescence in quantum wells by computer simulation". ''Physical Review B'' '''58''' (19): 13081–13087. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevB.58.13081 doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.58.13081.]&lt;/ref&gt; In experiments, disorder can lead to localization of carriers and hence drastically increase the photoluminescence life times as localized carriers cannot as easily find nonradiative recombination centers as can free ones.

Researchers from the [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)]] have studied the photoinduced [[entropy]] (i.e. thermodynamic disorder) of [[InGaN]]/[[GaN]] p-i-n [[double-heterostructure]] and [[AlGaN]] [[nanowires]] using temperature-dependent photoluminescence.&lt;ref name="entropyalfaraj2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="entropyalfaraj2017_1"&gt;Alfaraj, N.; Mumthaz Muhammed, M.; Li, K. ; Janjua, B.; Aljefri, R. A.; Sun, H.; Ng, T. K.; Ooi, B. S.; Roqan, I. S.; Li, X. (2017). "Thermodynamic photoinduced disorder in AlGaN nanowires". ''AIP Advances'' '''7''' (12): 125113. [https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5003443]&lt;/ref&gt; They defined the photoinduced [[entropy]] as a thermodynamic quantity that represents the unavailability of a system's energy for conversion into useful work due to [[carrier recombination]] and [[photon]] emission. They have also related the change in entropy generation to the change in photocarrier dynamics in the nanowire active regions using results from time-resolved photoluminescence study. They hypothesized that the amount of generated disorder in the [[InGaN]] layers eventually increases as the temperature approaches room temperature because of the thermal activation of [[surface states]], while an insignificant increase was observed in AlGaN nanowires, indicating lower degrees of disorder-induced uncertainty in the wider bandgap semiconductor. To study the photoinduced [[entropy]], the scientists have developed a mathematical model that considers the net energy exchange resulting from photoexcitation and photoluminescence.

== Photoluminescent material for temperature detection ==
In [[phosphor thermometry]], the temperature dependence of the photoluminescence process is exploited to measure temperature.

== Experimental Methods ==
Photoluminescence spectroscopy is a widely used technique for characterisation of the optical and electronic properties of semiconductors and molecules. In chemistry, it is more often referred to as [[fluorescence spectroscopy]], but the instrumentation is the same. The relaxation processes can be studied using [[Time-resolved spectroscopy#Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy|Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy]] to find the decay lifetime of the photoluminescence. These techniques can be combined with microscopy, to map the intensity ([[Confocal microscopy]]) or the lifetime ([[Fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy]]) of the photoluminescence across a sample (e.g. a semiconducting wafer, or a biological sample that has been marked with fluorescent molecules).

==History==

===1950s===
Following [[World War II]], the United States increased production of [[nuclear weapon]]s. The AEC chose the [[Dow Chemical Company]] to manage the bomb production facility. A {{convert|4|sqmi|km2|sing=on}} site about {{convert|15|mi|round=5}} northwest of Denver on a windy plateau called Rocky Flats was chosen for the facility. On July 10, 1951, ground was broken on the first building in the facility. Contemporary news reports stated that the site would not be used to produce nuclear bombs, but might be used to produce uranium and plutonium components for use in nuclear weapons. &lt;ref name=Pittsburgh1951&gt;{{cite news|title=New Atom Plant to be Built|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SwMiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cE0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4320,3002010&amp;dq=rocky-flats&amp;hl=en|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=March 23, 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, the plant began production of bomb components, manufacturing [[plutonium]] [[plutonium pit|pits]] which were used at the [[Pantex]] plant in [[Amarillo, Texas]] to assemble fission weapons and the primary stages of thermonuclear weapons.  By 1957, the plant had expanded to 27 buildings.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

On September 11, 1957, a plutonium fire occurred in one of the [[glovebox]]es used to handle [[radioactive]] materials, igniting the combustible rubber gloves and [[plexiglas]] windows of the box. [[Plutonium#Flammability|Metallic plutonium is a fire hazard]] and [[Pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]]; under the right conditions it may ignite in air at room temperature.  The accident resulted in the [[radioactive contamination|contamination]] of Building 771, the release of plutonium into the atmosphere, and caused [[United States dollar|$]]818,600 in damage. An [[incinerator]] for plutonium-contaminated waste was installed in Building 771 in 1958.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Barrels of [[radioactive waste]] were found to be leaking into an open field in 1959. This was not made publicly known until 1970 when wind-borne particles were detected in Denver.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===1960s===
Throughout the 1960s, the plant continued to enlarge and add buildings. The 1960s also brought more contamination to the site. In 1967, {{convert|3500|oilbbl|m3}} of plutonium-contaminated [[lubricant]]s and [[solvent]]s were stored on Pad 903. A large number of them were found to be leaking, and low-level contaminated soil was becoming wind-borne from this area. This pad was covered with [[gravel]] and [[pavement (material)|paved]] over with [[asphalt]] in 1969.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

May 11, 1969 saw a major fire in a glovebox in Building 776/777.&lt;ref name="hobbs2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobbs|first=Farrel|title=An Insider's View of Rocky Flats: Urban Myths Debunked|year=2010|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=978-1460911471}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the costliest [[industrial accident]] ever to occur in the United States up to that time. Cleanup from the accident took two years and led to safety upgrades on the site, including [[fire sprinkler system]]s and [[firewall (construction)|firewalls]].

===1970s===
In order to reduce the danger of public contamination and to create a security area around the plant following protests, the [[United States Congress]] authorized the purchase of a {{convert|4600|acre|sqmi km2|sing=on}} buffer zone around the plant in 1972. In 1973, nearby [[Walnut Creek (Colorado)|Walnut Creek]] and the [[Great Western Reservoir]] were found to have elevated [[tritium]] levels. The tritium was determined to have been released from contaminated materials shipped to Rocky Flats from the [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]]. Discovery of the contamination by the Colorado Department of Health led to investigations by the AEC and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). As a result of the investigation, several [[environmental mitigation|mitigation]] efforts were put in place to prevent further contamination. Some of the elements included channeling of [[wastewater]] runoff to three [[dam]]s for testing before release into the water system and construction of a [[reverse osmosis]] facility to clean up wastewater.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The next year, elevated plutonium levels were found in the [[topsoil]] near the now covered Pad 903. An additional 4,500 acres (18&amp;nbsp;km²) of buffer zone were purchased.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

1975 saw [[Rockwell International]] replacing Dow Chemical as the contractor for the site. This year also saw local landowners suing for property contamination caused by the plant.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1978, 60 protesters belonging to the [[Rocky Flats Truth Force]], or Satyagraha Affinity Group, based in [[Boulder, Colorado]], were arrested for [[trespassing]] at Rocky Flats, and were brought to trial before Judge Kim Goldberger. Dr. John Candler Cobb, Professor of Preventive Medicine at the [[University of Colorado Health Sciences Center|University of Colorado]] Medical Center, testified that the most significant danger of radioactive contamination came from the 1967 incident in which oil barrels containing plutonium leaked {{convert|5,000|USgal|L}} of [[petroleum|oil]] into [[sand]] under the barrels, which was then blown by strong winds as far away as Denver. Radioactivity of the sand at the spill site was measured at 30 million [[radioactive decay|disintegrations]] per minute per gram (about 220 [[Parts per million|ppm]] plutonium in the sand by weight), 15 million times higher than the state standard of two disintegrations per minute.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Reuteman, "Vindication at last for all who feared Rocky Flats", ''The [[Rocky Mountain News]]'', February 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2013}}

[[Carl J. Johnson|Dr. Carl Johnson]], Jefferson County health director from 1973 to 1981, directed numerous studies on contamination levels and health risks the plant posed to public health. Based on his conclusions, Johnson opposed housing development near Rocky Flats. He was fired. Later studies confirmed many of his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/fallout-at-a-former-nuclear-weapon-plant.html?ref=atomicenergy |title=Nuclear Fallout |author=Kristen Iversen |date=March 10, 2012 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 1979, a few weeks after the [[Three Mile Island accident]], a crowd of close to 15,000 protesters assembled at a nearby site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rlIH-NQbFQgC&amp;pg=PA295&amp;lpg=PA295&amp;dq=atomic+protests+arrests+power&amp;source=web&amp;ots=7R0_4BSy1F&amp;sig=1VLLONdkehSNSOlupuHOhDTFMJY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result Nonviolent Social Movements] p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=263456 Headline: Rocky Flats Nuclear Plant / Protest]&lt;/ref&gt; Singers [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Bonnie Raitt]] took the stage along with various speakers.

{{See also|Rocky Flats Truth Force}}
''[[Dark Circle (film)|Dark Circle]]'' is a 1982 American documentary film that focuses on the Rocky Flats Plant and [[Radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant|its plutonium contamination of the area's environment]].  The film won the Grand Prize for documentary at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] and received a national [[Emmy Award]] for "Outstanding individual achievement in news and documentary".&lt;ref name="Dark Circle"&gt;''[https://www.pbs.org/pov/darkcircle/ Dark Circle]'', DVD release date March 27, 2007, Directors: Judy Irving, Chris Beaver, Ruth Landy. {{ISBN|0-7670-9304-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocky Flats became a focus of protest by peace activists throughout the 1980s. In 1983, a demonstration was organized that brought together 17,000 people who joined hands in an encirclement around the {{convert|17|mi|km|adj=on}} perimeter of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=526914 Headline: Colorado / Anti-Nuclear Demonstration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rock&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-5909492.html Activists fail to encircle Rocky Flats/ Too few join hands in symbolic protest]&lt;/ref&gt;

A perimeter security zone was installed around the facility in 1983 and was upgraded with remote detection abilities in 1985. Also in 1983, the first radioactive waste was processed through the aqueous recovery system, creating a plutonium button.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A celebration of 250,000 continuous safe hours by the employees at Rocky Flats happened in 1985. The same year, Rockwell received Industrial Research Magazine's IR-100 award for a process to remove [[actinide]] contamination from wastewater at the plant. The next year, the site received a [[National Safety Council]] Award of Honor for outstanding safety performance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

On August 10, 1987, 320 demonstrators were arrested after they tried to force a one-day shutdown of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/10/us/570-arrested-in-a-bomb-protests.html?src=pm |title=570 Arrested in A-Bomb Protests |author= |date=August 10, 1987  |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, a [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) safety evaluation resulted in a report that was critical of safety measures at the plant. The EPA fined the plant for [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCB) leaks from a [[transformer]]. A solid waste form, called [[pondcrete]], was found not to have [[curing (chemistry)|cured]] properly and was leaking from containers. A [[boxcar]] of [[transuranium element|transuranic]] waste from the site was refused entry into [[Idaho]] and returned to the plant. Plans to potentially close the plant were released.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1989 an employee left a faucet running, resulting in [[chromic acid]] being released into the sanitary water system. The Colorado Department of Health and the EPA both posted full-time personnel at the plant to monitor safety. Plutonium production was suspended due to safety violations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In August 1989, an estimated 3,500 people turned out for a demonstration at Rocky Flats.&lt;ref name=rock/&gt;

====FBI/EPA investigation, June 1989 raid====
In 1987, plant insiders started to covertly inform the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about the unsafe conditions. In December 1988, the FBI commenced clandestine flights of light aircraft over the area and confirmed via infrared video recordings that the "outdated and unpermitted" Building 771 incinerator was apparently being used late into the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-10/news/mn-1216_1_rocky-flats-illegal-atom-waste-disposal-plutonium-triggers|title=FBI Alleges Cover-Up at Rocky Flats :  Papers Say Energy Dept.

The FBI discovered numerous violations of federal anti-[[pollution]] laws, including limited&lt;ref name="hobbs2010"/&gt; contamination of water and soil. In 1992, Rockwell International was charged with environmental crimes including violations of the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA), and the Clean Water Act. Rockwell pleaded guilty and paid an $18.5 million fine. This was the largest fine for an environmental crime to that date.

After the June 1989 FBI raid, federal authorities used the subsequent grand jury investigation to gather evidence of wrongdoing and then sealed the record. In October 2006, DOE announced completion of the Rocky Flats cleanup without this information being available.&lt;ref name="Democracy and Public Health"&gt;{{cite book | last = Moore | first1 = LeRoy | chapter-url = http://media.wix.com/ugd/cff93e_5d3b6b6a12204505a3bc0fd2e2f504eb.pdf | title = Tortured Science: Health Studies, Ethics, and Nuclear Weapons in the United States | chapter = Democracy and Public Health at Rocky Flats: The Examples of Edward A.

The FBI raid led to the formation of Colorado's first [[Grand Jury#Current usage in the United States|special grand jury]] in 1989, the juried testimony of 110 witnesses, reviews of 2,000 exhibits, and ultimately a 1992 plea agreement in which Rockwell admitted to 10 federal environmental crimes and agreed to pay $18.5 million in fines out of its own funds.  This amount was less than the company had been paid in bonuses for running the plant as determined by the [[Government Accounting Office]] (GAO), and yet was also by far the highest hazardous-waste fine ever; four times larger than the previous record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-15/magazine/tm-24105_1_rocky-flats-grand-jury/6 | work = Los Angeles Times | first = Barry | last = Siegel | title = Showdown at Rocky Flats : The Justice Department had negotiated a Rocky Flats settlement, but the grand jury could not keep quiet about what happened there | date = August 15, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to indemnification of nuclear contractors, without some form of settlement being arrived at between the U.S. Justice Department and Rockwell, the cost of paying any civil penalties would ultimately have been borne by U.S. taxpayers.

Regardless, and as forewarned by the prosecuting U.S. Attorney, Ken Fimberg/Scott,&lt;ref&gt;Prosecuting U.S. attorney Fimberg changed his last name to Scott after the Rocky Flats deliberations were finalized; see ''The Ambushed Grand Jury'', page 118.&lt;/ref&gt; the Department of Justice's stated findings and plea agreement with Rockwell were heavily contested by its own, 23-member special grand jury.  Press leaks on both sides—members of the DOJ and the grand jury—occurred in violation of secrecy regarding grand jury information, a federal crime punishable by a prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/guidelines/206584.htm Rule 6(e)]&lt;/ref&gt; The public contest led to U.S. Congressional oversight committee hearings chaired by Congressman [[Howard Wolpe]], which issued subpoenas to DOJ principals despite several instances of DOJ's refusal to comply.  The hearings, whose findings include that the Justice Department had "bargained away the truth",&lt;ref&gt;''The Ambushed Grand Jury'', Chapter 6, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately still did not fully reveal to the public the special grand jury's report, which remains sealed by the DOJ courts.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Ambushed Grand Jury'', Chapter 6, Note 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The special grand jury report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/jury/gj/rocky_flats/rocky-flats-grand-jury-report.htm The special grand jury report]&lt;/ref&gt; was nonetheless leaked to ''[[Westword]]''.  According to its subsequent publications, the Rocky Flats special grand jury had compiled indictments charging three DOE officials and five Rockwell employees with environmental crimes. The grand jury also wrote a report, intended for the public's consumption per their charter, lambasting the conduct of DOE and Rocky Flats contractors for "engaging in a continuing campaign of distraction, deception and dishonesty" and noted that Rocky Flats, for many years, had discharged pollutants, hazardous materials and radioactive matter into nearby creeks and Broomfield's and Westminster's water supplies.&lt;ref name="Servant of the people"&gt;{{cite news |last=Warner |first=Joel |url=http://archive.boulderweekly.com/010605/coverstory.html |title=Servant of the people |work=Boulder Weekly |date=2005-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827190040/http://archive.boulderweekly.com/010605/coverstory.html |archivedate=August 27, 2012 |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DOE itself, in a study released in December of the year prior to the FBI raid, had called Rocky Flats' ground water the single greatest environmental hazard at any of its nuclear facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-15/magazine/tm-24105_1_rocky-flats-grand-jury/2 | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | first = Barry | last = Siegel | title = Showdown at Rocky Flats : The Justice Department had negotiated a Rocky Flats settlement, but the grand jury could not keep quiet about what happened there | date = August 15, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]], which govern federal grand jury proceedings, explicitly require grand jury proceedings to be kept secret unless otherwise provided by the Rules.&lt;ref&gt;See Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 6, https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_6#&lt;/ref&gt; Rocky Flats' secret grand jury proceedings were not unique.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

However, some activists dispute the reasons for records confidentiality:&lt;ref&gt;5280 Magazine, Rogue Agent, http://www.5280.com/news/magazine/2016/04/rogue-agent?page=full&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. LeRoy Moore, a Boulder scientist; retired [[FBI]] Special Agent Jon Lipsky,&lt;ref name="Servant of the people"/&gt; who led the FBI's raid of the Rocky Flats plant to investigate illegal plutonium burning and other environmental crimes; and Wes McKinley, who was the foreman of the grand jury investigation into the operations at Rocky Flats (and served several terms as Colorado State Representative).&lt;ref name="Hardesty2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ENS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/aug2010/2010-08-05-01.html | title=Rocky Flats Nuclear Site Too Hot for Public Access, Citizens Warn | publisher=[[Environment News Service]] | date=August 5, 2010 | accessdate=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wald2004"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/13/us/book-says-us-aides-lied-in-nuclear-arms-plant-case.html | title=Book Says U.S. Aides Lied In Nuclear-Arms Plant Case | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 13, 2004 | accessdate=September 17, 2011 | author=Wald, Matthew L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former grand jury foreman McKinley chronicles his experiences in the 2004 book he co-authored with attorney Caron Balkany, ''The Ambushed Grand Jury'', which begins with an open letter to the U.S. Congress from Special Agent Lipsky:

{{quote|I am an FBI agent. My superiors have ordered me to lie about a criminal investigation I headed in 1989.  We were investigating the US Department of Energy, but the US Justice Department covered up the truth.

I have refused to follow the orders to lie about what really happened during that criminal investigation at Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant.  Instead, I have told the author of this book the truth.  Her promise to me if I told her what really happened was that she would put it in a book to tell Congress and the American people.

Some dangerous decisions are now being made based on that government cover-up.  Please read this book.  I believe you know what needs to happen.&lt;ref name="McKinley2004"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = McKinley | first1 = Wes | last2 = Balkany | first2 = Caron | title = The Ambushed Grand Jury: How the Justice Department Covered up Government Nuclear Crimes and How We Caught Them Red Handed | publisher = Apex Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-891843-28-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===1990s===
Rockwell International was replaced by [[EG&amp;G]] as primary contractor for the Rocky Flats plant.&lt;ref name=rtabrfpl &gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ztE9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B4cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4704%2C4053310 |newspaper=Bend Bulletin |location=(Oregon)|agency=Associated Press |title=Rockwell to abandon Rocky Flats plant |page=A-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; EG&amp;G began an aggressive work safety and cleanup plan for the site that included construction of a system to remove contamination from the [[groundwater]] of the site. The ''Sierra Club vs. Rockwell'' case was decided in favor of the [[Sierra Club]]. The ruling directed Rocky Flats to manage plutonium residues as hazardous waste.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1991, an interagency agreement between DOE, the Colorado Department of Health, and the EPA outlined multiyear schedules for environmental restoration studies and remediation activities. DOE released a report that advocated downsizing the plant's production into a more streamlined facility. Due to the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], production of most of the systems at Rocky Flats was no longer needed, leaving only the [[W88]] [[warhead]] primary stages.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1992, due to an order by President G.H.W. Bush, production of [[submarine]]-based [[missile]]s using the W88 trigger was discontinued, leading to the layoff of 4,500 employees at the plant; 4,000 others were retained for long-term cleanup of the facility. The Rocky Flats Plant Transition Plan outlined the environmental restoration process. The DOE announced that {{convert|61|lb}} of plutonium lined the exhaust [[duct (HVAC)|ductwork]] in six buildings on the site.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Starting in 1993, [[weapons-grade]] plutonium began to be shipped to the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], and the [[Savannah River Site]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1994 the site was renamed the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, reflecting the changed nature of the site from weapon production to environmental cleanup and [[environmental restoration|restoration]]. The cleanup effort was contracted to the Kaiser-Hill Company, which proposed the release of {{convert|4100|acre|sqmi km2|1}} of the buffer zone for public access.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1998, the [[Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment]]'s Cancer Registry conducted an independent study of cancer rates in areas around the Rocky Flats Site. Data showed no pattern of increased cancers tied to Rocky Flats.&lt;ref&gt;Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Cancer Registry, "Ratios of Cancer Incidence in Ten Areas Around Rocky Flats, Colorado" (1998), https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/cdphe-rocky-flats-cancer-study&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the remainder of the 1990s and into the 2000s, cleanup of contaminated sites and dismantling of contaminated buildings continued with the waste materials being shipped to the [[Nevada Test Site]], the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]] in [[New Mexico]], and the Envirocare company facility in [[Utah]],&lt;ref name=rshfu/&gt; which is now EnergySolutions.

===2000s===
[[File:Rocky Flats Demolition (14594644241).jpg|thumb|Industrial building demolished at Rocky Flats]]
In 2001, Congress passed the '''Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Final Rocky Flats Sign Text | url = http://www.fws.gov/rockyflats/Signage/Final%20Rocky%20Flats%20Sign%20Text%202.23.07.pdf | format = PDF | author = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service | date = January 31, 2007 | accessdate = April 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, the U.S. Department of Energy transferred nearly {{convert|4000|acre|sqmi km2|0}} of land on the Rocky Flats site to the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] to establish the [[Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge]].&lt;ref name="RFNWR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/refuge/rocky_flats/ |title=Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |accessdate=2016-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys of the site reveal 630 species of [[vascular plant]]s, 76% of which are native.&lt;ref name=nelson&gt;Nelson, J. K. (2010).

However, the DOE retained the central area of the site, the Central Operable Unit.

The last contaminated building was removed and the last weapons-grade plutonium was shipped out in 2003, ending the cleanup based on a modified cleanup agreement. The modified agreement required a higher level of cleanup in the first {{convert|3|ft|1}} of [[soil]] in exchange for not having to remove any contamination below that point unless it posed a chance of migrating to the surface or contaminating the groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Glovebox removal heralds new Flats era | publisher = [[The Denver Post]] | date = December 9, 2004 | url = http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~53~2585337,00.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050116085904/http://www.cwwg.org/dp12.09.04.html | archivedate = January 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About half of the 800 buildings previously existing on the site had been dismantled by early December 2004.

The site is contaminated with residual plutonium due to several industrial fires that occurred on the site and other inadvertent releases caused by wind at a waste storage area. The other major contaminant is [[carbon tetrachloride]] (CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Both of these substances affected areas adjacent to the site. In addition, there were small releases of [[beryllium]] and tritium, as well as [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] from [[incineration]].&lt;ref name="Key questions"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/HM_sf-rocky-flats-exposures-study-key-questions-addressed.pdf | title = Key questions addressed by the research | work = Rocky Flats, Historical Public Exposures Studies | publisher = Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060517040403/http://www.cdphe.state.co.us/rf/keyquestionsaddressed.htm | archivedate = May 17, 2006 | accessdate = 2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/HM_sf-rocky-flats-contamination-released-to-surface-water.pdf | title = Contaminants Released to Surface Water from Rocky Flats | publisher = Department of Public Health and Environment | archivedate=February 10, 2016| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160210035628/https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/HM_sf-rocky-flats-contamination-released-to-surface-water.pdf | accessdate = September 3, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleanup was declared complete on October 13, 2005.&lt;ref name=nucclnup/&gt; About {{convert|1300|acre|sqmi km2|0}} of the original site, the former industrial area, remains under U.S. DOE Office of Legacy Management control for ongoing environmental monitoring and [[environmental remediation|remediation]]. On March 14, 2007, DOE, EPA, and CDPHE entered into the Rocky Flats Legacy Management Agreement (RFLMA). The agreement establishes the regulatory framework for implementing the final remedy for the Rocky Flats site and ensuring the protection of human health and the environment.

In September 2010, after a 20-year legal battle, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a $926 million award in a [[class-action lawsuit]] against Dow Chemical and Rockwell International.&lt;ref name="The Denver Post"&gt;{{cite news | title = Appeals court tosses jury award in Rocky Flats case | publisher = [[The Denver Post]] | date = September 4, 2010 | url = http://www.denverpost.com/ci_15989514}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The three-judge panel said that the jury reached its decision on faulty instructions that incorrectly stated the law. The appeals court tossed the jury verdict and sent the case back to the District Court.  According to the Appellate Court, the owners of 12,000 properties in the class-action area had not proved their properties were damaged or that they suffered bodily injury from plutonium that blew onto their properties.&lt;ref name="The Denver Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook, et al. v.

In response to historic and ongoing reports of health issues by people who live and lived near Rocky Flats, an online health survey was launched in May 2016 by Metropolitan State University, Rocky Flats Downwinders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rockyflatsdownwinders.com/|title=ROCKY FLATS DOWNWINDERS {{!}} A community organization advocating for residents living downwind from Rocky Flats.|website=rockyflatsdownwinders.com|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other local universities and health agencies to survey thousands of Coloradans who lived east of the Rocky Flats plant while it was operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_29900780/health-survey-rocky-flats-neighbors-launch-tuesday|title=Health survey of Rocky Flats neighbors to launch Tuesday|website=www.denverpost.com|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2016, a $375 million settlement was reached over claims by more than 15,000 nearby homeowners that plutonium releases from the plant risked their health and devalued their property. This settlement ended a 26-year legal battle between residents and the two corporations that ran the Rocky Flats Plant, Dow Chemical and Rockwell International, for the Department of Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/05/20/deal-reached-between-homeowners-rocky-flats-operators/|title=Deal Reached Between Homeowners, Rocky Flats Operators|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

June 2014 marked a quarter century since the historic FBI and EPA raid of the Rocky Flats plant. A 3-day weekend of events from Friday, June 6 through Sunday, June 8 took place at the Arvada Center for the Arts, "Rocky Flats Then and Now: 25 Years After the Raid".&lt;ref&gt;https://arvadacenter.org/on-stage/rocky-flats-then-and-now-2014&lt;/ref&gt; Panel discussions covered various aspects of the Rocky Flats raid and its aftermath. On display were historical photographs and artifacts, as well as Rocky Flats-inspired art.

In 2016, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's Cancer Registry completed a cancer incidence study that looked at the incidence of reported cancers in areas around Rocky Flats from 1990 to 2014. This study followed-up on and was modeled after CDPHE's original Rocky Flats cancer incidence study, which was completed in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;CDPHE Cancer Registry Study (1998), https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/cdphe-rocky-flats-cancer-study&lt;/ref&gt; Ten cancers specifically linked to plutonium exposure and other cancers of concern to a Health Advisory Panel were assessed in 1998, and again in 2016. The study found "the incidence of all cancers-combined for both adults and children was no different in the communities surrounding Rocky Flats than would be expected based on cancer rates in the remainder of the Denver Metro area for 1990 to 2014."&lt;ref&gt;CDPHE, Updated Cancer Incidence Study (2016), https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/cdphe-rocky-flats-cancer-study&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, the CDPHE Cancer Registry completed a supplement to this study that specifically looked at the incidence of thyroid and rare cancers in neighborhoods around Rocky Flats. Cancer incidence data showed "no evidence of higher than expected frequencies of thyroid cancer" and "the incidence of 'rare' cancer was not higher than expected compared to the remainder of the Denver Metro area."&lt;ref&gt;2017 Rocky Flats Supplement to the 2016 Rocky Flats cancer incidence study, https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/cdphe-rocky-flats-cancer-study&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 1603''' of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act (ARRTA) was a green energy subsidy program created by Congress and signed into law as a part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009 stimulus package]]. The program was a system of cash grants that was implemented by the U.S. Treasury Department's "Payments for Specified Energy Projects in Lieu of Tax Credits."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The purpose of payments made from the Section 1603 program were to reimburse grant recipients for a portion of the cost they incurred to install certain types of energy systems at business locations. Payments were made after the energy systems were installed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/recovery/Pages/1603.aspx|title=1603 Program: Payments for Specified Energy Property in Lieu of Tax Credits|website=United States Department of the Treasury|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualifying energy systems ==
The types of energy systems that qualified for the program were [[biomass]], combined heat and power, [[fuel cell]]s, [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]], [[Hydropower|incremental hydropower]], [[landfill gas]], marine hydrokinetic, [[Gas turbine|microturbine]], [[municipal solid waste]], [[Solar power|solar]] and [[Wind power|wind]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/recovery/Documents/STATUS%20OVERVIEW.pdf|title=Overview and Status Update of the §1603 Program|last=|first=|date=2016-05-05|website=United States Department of the Treasury|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding and status ==
As of April 2016, the program funded 104,733 projects. Total cumulative funding for the program stood at $24.9 billion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{efn|To view a table of showing funding, number of projects, and capacity in megawatts state-by-state, visit page 4 of [https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/recovery/Documents/STATUS%20OVERVIEW.pdf Treasury Department's Overview and Status Update of the §1603 Program].}}

The Treasury Department no longer accepts applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The program started in 2009 and ended in 2012. However, Congress has continued to investigate the program as recently as June 2016.

== Congressional oversight and issues ==
Primary oversight activity over the program has occurred at the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]]. On June 9, 2016, Chairman Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] requested from [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of Treasury]], the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and the [[Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration]] (TIGTA) details about how companies use Section 1603 grants and tax credits. In March 2016, Hatch asked the IRS and Treasury Department to demonstrate that the agencies use safeguards and coordinate with each other when reviewing applications for Section 1603 grants.&lt;ref&gt;Senator Orrin Hatch, U.S. Senate Finance Committee. Letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew; Letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen; and Letter to Inspector General J. Russell George.

In 2013, an investigation by TIGTA found that the IRS had did not have a system to track the accounts of taxpayers receiving Section 1603 grants. As a consequence, grant recipients could amend back tax returns to claim a tax credit in addition to receiving the grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/policy-and-regulation/872-hatch-continues-green-energy-programs-inquiry/|title=Hatch continues green energy programs inquiry - Daily Energy Insider|date=2016-06-13|website=Daily Energy Insider|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stave Puzzles''' is an American [[jigsaw puzzle]] company located in [[Norwich, Vermont]]. The company was started in 1974 by [[Steve Richardson (puzzle designer)|Steve Richardson]] and Dave Tibbetts, the name being a combination of their two first names.  They manufacture hand cut jigsaw puzzles made from cherry-backed, 5-layered, {{convert|1/4|in|adj=on}} wood.  Stave produces several different puzzles types ranging from traditional puzzles, teaser puzzles which can have many open areas within the puzzles, trick puzzles in which the puzzles can be put together in two or more ways of which only one is correct.  They also create three-dimensional puzzles, [[Special edition|limited edition]] puzzles and complete custom puzzles.  Each puzzle is provided in a green and blue [[Cuboid|rectangular box]] and does not include a picture of the completed puzzle.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Stave Puzzles is the largest hand-cut jigsaw puzzle company in the USA, but faces growing competition from laser-cutting companies like [[Liberty Puzzles]] and [[Artifact Puzzles]] that produce similar products at roughly a tenth of the cost.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Company history ==

Steve Richardson moved from [[New Jersey]] to [[Vermont]] in 1969 and started a game design business with Dave Tibbetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sharp |first=Bill |date=November 1989|title= A puzzle maker in Vermont builds customer loyalty.|journal= Adweek's Marketing Week|volume= v30|issue= n47|pages= 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Richardson was offered US$300 to make a wooden jigsaw puzzle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Pennington|first = April Y. | title = Steve Richardson - Snapshot - Brief Article | publisher = BNET Business Network | date = September 2002 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_9_30/ai_96737070/pg_1 | accessdate = 2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson and Tibbetts founded Stave Puzzles in the same year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Acton | first = Johnny |author2=Tania Adams |author3=Matt Packer  | title = Origin of Everyday Things | publisher = Sterling | date = 2006-11-28 | pages = #127 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FY35-noly_IC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=%22stave+puzzles%22 | isbn = 978-1-4027-4302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming the name from a combination of their first names.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In 1976, Richardson bought out Tibbetts' share of the company for US$1 and a jigsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Maxwell | first = Jill Hecht | title = Main Street: Putting It Together | issue = June 2002 | publisher = [[Inc.

In 1983, Stave introduced their first 2-Way Trick Puzzle, called Go Fish.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In 1989, Stave Puzzles released an [[April Fools' Day]] joke puzzle called ''5 Easy Pieces'', which had no solution. The puzzles first thirty buyers were refunded their purchase price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1992-11-14|title=Piece offering|journal=Economist|volume= 325|issue= 7785|pages=76|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owners of Stave Puzzles include [[Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Barbara Bush]], [[Stephen King]], [[Julie Andrews]], [[Tom Peters]], and [[Bill Gates]].&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Anne D. | title = The Jigsaw Puzzle: Piecing Together a History | publisher = Berkley | date = 2005-11-01 | pages = #134 | isbn = 978-0-425-20182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{cite news | last = Méndez | first = Teresa | title = Deep inside the piece process | publisher = [[Christian Science Monitor]] | date = 2006-03-17 | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0317/p11s02-alar.html | accessdate = 2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Stave Puzzles was listed in [[Guinness World Records|the Guinness Book of World Records]] as having the most expensive jigsaw puzzle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McFarlan | first = Donald |author2=, Norris McWhirter  | title = Guinness Book of World Records 1990 | publisher = [[Bantam Books]] | year = 1990 | pages = #334 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=y8Pm70o2tmoC&amp;q=%22stave+puzzles%22&amp;dq=%22stave+puzzles%22 | isbn = 0-553-28452-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;Stave Puzzles was named by [[Tom Peters]] as the 1991 Product of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tompeters.com/col_entries.php?note=005332&amp;year=1991|title=Most Valuable Players 1991|last=Peters|first=Tom|date=1991-12-21|accessdate=2008-05-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531011948/http://www.tompeters.com/col_entries.php?note=005332&amp;year=1991|archivedate=2008-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==

=== Traditional puzzles ===
Stave produces traditional rectangular puzzles that range in size from {{convert|5|x|7|in|cm|0}} (75 pieces) to {{convert|20|x|25|in|cm|0}} (1000 pieces).  For every hundred pieces, five custom pieces (such as dates, names, or [[silhouette]]s) can be cut into the puzzle.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

=== Teaser puzzles ===

Stave's Teaser puzzles are designed in such a way as to make assembly of the jigsaw puzzle harder than in a traditional jigsaw creation. Stave commissions original artwork for these puzzles. Illustrators and Stave craftspeople work together on the design to reduce the number of visual cues that would normally make it easy to put together a traditional puzzle.[https://www.stavepuzzles.com/puzzles/teasers/]

A typical Teaser design has some areas that are similar to traditional puzzles, making it easier to assemble some of the puzzle. However, in the center of the puzzle, or in other separate areas, holes are left into which many pieces have to fit. These pieces may be silhouettes of shapes that are representative of objects, people, animals, etc. It's not apparent how they fit together in the holes of the puzzle until they are played with and studied.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The difficult rating system for Teasers is measured on a scale of one to four swords, with four swords being the most difficult.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

=== Trick puzzles ===
Steve Richardson earned the name Chief Tormentor for inventing the Trick puzzle,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; a puzzle genre in which some pieces fit in two or more different places, but only one of the solutions is considered correct. The object of a Trick puzzle is detailed on a small block of wood that accompanies Trick puzzles.&lt;ref name="cigar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grossmann|first=John|title=Going to Pieces|journal=Cigar Aficionado|volume=May/Jun 1997|issn=1063-7885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a Stave Trick puzzle is ''[http://www.stavepuzzles.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=3032 Champ]'', which is made up of 44 blue pieces and fits together 32 different ways, only one of which is correct where the serpent eats its own tail.&lt;ref name="cigar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Antrim | first = Taylor | title = I Did the Funky Chicken | publisher = [[Forbes]] | date = 2005-06-20 | url = https://www.forbes.com/fyi/2005/0620/092.html | accessdate = 2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty rating system for Trick puzzles is measured on a scale of one to five lightning bolts, with five being the most difficult.&lt;ref name="cigar" /&gt; Teaser and Trick puzzles have been combined together in puzzles such as ''Palace of Pranks''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stavepuzzles.com/store/product_info.php?cPath=2&amp;products_id=3416&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limited-Edition puzzles ===
Stave Limited Edition puzzles are produced from custom commissioned artwork and sold in a limited quantity. A typical limited edition has included only 50 units, although some runs have included as many as 100 units.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The four main types of limited edition puzzles include: Double Deckers; Riddle; Mystery Story; and Trick. Some of the limited edition puzzles are hand painted (as opposed to a print affixed to the wood).{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In general, the limited editions also include items that fit the theme and help guide the player through the puzzle and additional games. For example, the Limited Edition Trick Puzzle ''Time Traveler'' comes with several hand crafted booklets to link the puzzle to the time-travel theme underlying the puzzle. The theme of the puzzle is major events (cultural, historical, scientific discoveries, etc.) from 1000 CE to 2000 CE. The booklets guide you through untangling a set of chronological mishaps caused by an evildoer.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

'''Double deckers''': Double decker puzzles are made up of multiple layers that sit on top of one another. Irregular edges and dropouts highlight the imagery in interesting ways. Some double decker puzzles include very simple tricks—swappable image areas. For example, the [[Snow White]] limited edition allows you to swap [[Queen (Snow White)|the Evil Queen]] and Snow White in the mirror.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

'''Riddle puzzles''': Riddle puzzles are accompanied by a book of riddles, [[word game]]s, and other surprises linked to the puzzle. For example, figural pieces in the puzzle might form a [[rebus]] that must be solved.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

'''Mystery story''': Each puzzle is accompanied by a complete mystery novel. However, you do not learn the ending of the mystery until you send in your answer to Stave's "mystery hot line." For example, the limited edition Hexed has artwork by Andrea Farnham and a novel by Susan Stofflet. The puzzle comes in sections enclosed in velvet bags that you do in pieces as you read and solve parts of the mystery.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

'''Trick''': The limited edition trick puzzles are similar in general challenge types to the other trick puzzles sold by Stave. The main difference is greater theming and integration. Taking Time Traveler as an example, the entire puzzle has a theme, and solving the tricks and re-arranging the pieces is linked to a story and learning about history. Other puzzles such as Knight at Stavely Castle include 3D pop-ups such as an entire castle façade that goes together multiple ways and a 3D sword that you need to remove from a stone.&lt;ref name="cigar" /&gt; These trick puzzles are thus more intense than the generally available trick puzzles because of the themed linking between the puzzle and accompanying materials.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

'''List of Limited Editions and statuses'''

Some of the Limited Editions which have been released by Stave include:&lt;ref&gt;Status approximate as of 19 May 2008; list based on Stave Limited Edition advertising mailed in Dec 2007 combined with phone call with Stave to obtain statuses on 19 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stishovite''' is an extremely hard, dense [[tetragonal]] form ([[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]) of [[silicon dioxide]].  It is very rare on the Earth's surface, however, it may be a predominant form of silicon dioxide in the Earth, especially in the lower mantle.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitry L. Lakshtanov et al.  "The post-stishovite phase transition in hydrous alumina-bearing SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the lower mantle of the earth" PNAS 2007 104 (34) 13588-13590; {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0706113104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stishovite was named after [[Sergey M. Stishov]], a Russian high-pressure physicist who first synthesized the mineral in 1961. It was discovered in [[Meteor Crater]] in 1962 by [[Edward C. T. Chao]].&lt;ref name="Fleischer1962"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fleischer |first1=Michael|year=1962|title=New mineral names |journal=American Mineralogist |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=172–174 |publisher=Mineralogical Society of America |doi= |url=http://rruff.info/uploads/AM47_805.pdf |accessdate=  |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other silica polymorphs, the crystal structure of stishovite resembles that of [[rutile]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The silicon in stishovite adopts an octahedral coordination geometry, being bound to six oxides. Similarly, the oxides are three-connected, unlike low-pressure forms of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  In most silicates, silicon is tetrahedral, being bound to four oxides.&lt;ref name="Ross1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ross |first1=Nancy L.|year=1990|title=High pressure crystal chemistry of stishovite|journal=American Mineralogist |volume=75 |issue=7 |pages=739–747 |publisher=Mineralogical Society of America |doi= |url= http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM75/AM75_739.pdf|accessdate= |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was long considered the hardest known oxide (~30 GPa Vickers&lt;ref name=hard/&gt;); however, [[boron suboxide]] has been discovered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He|first1=Duanwei|last2=Zhao|first2=Yusheng|last3=Daemen|first3=L.|last4=Qian|first4=J.|last5=Shen|first5=T. D.|last6=Zerda|first6=T. W.|title=Boron suboxide: As hard as cubic boron nitride|journal=[[Applied Physics Letters]]|date=2002|volume=81|issue=4|page=643|doi=10.1063/1.1494860|bibcode=2002ApPhL..81..643H}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 to be much harder. At normal temperature and pressure, stishovite is metastable.

Stishovite can be separated from quartz by applying [[hydrogen fluoride]] (HF); unlike quartz, stishovite will not react.&lt;ref name="Fleischer1962"/&gt;

==Appearance==
Large natural crystals of stishovite are extremely rare and are usually found as clasts of 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;mm in length. When found, they can be difficult to distinguish from regular quartz without laboratory analysis. It has a vitreous luster, is transparent (or translucent), and is extremely hard. Stishovite usually sits as small rounded gravels in a matrix of other minerals.

==Synthesis==
Until recently, the only known occurrences of stishovite in nature formed at the very high shock pressures (&gt;100 kbar, or 10 GPa) and temperatures (&gt; 1200&amp;nbsp;°C) present during hypervelocity [[meteorite]] [[impact crater|impact]] into [[quartz]]-bearing [[Rock (geology)|rock]].  Minute amounts of stishovite have been found within diamonds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.04.041|title=Inclusions of nanocrystalline hydrous aluminium silicate "Phase Egg" in superdeep diamonds from Juina (Mato Grosso State, Brazil) |year=2007 |last1=Wirth |first1=R.|last2=Vollmer|first2=C.|last3=Brenker|first3=F.|last4=Matsyuk|first4=S.|last5=Kaminsky|first5=F.|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=259|pages=384 |bibcode=2007E&amp;PSL.259..384W|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and post-stishovite phases were identified within ultra-high-pressure mantle rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.08.010|url=http://micron.ucr.edu/public/KNB-papers/Liu-et-al-2007.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717031853/http://micron.ucr.edu/Public/KNB-papers/Liu-et-al-2007.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-07-17|title=Evidence of former stishovite in metamorphosed sediments, implying subduction to &gt;350 km|year=2007|last1=Liu|first1=L.|last2=Zhang|first2=J.|last3=Greenii|first3=H.|last4=Jin|first4=Z.|last5=Bozhilov|first5=K.|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|bibcode=2007E&amp;PSL.263..180L|volume=263|issue=3–4|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stishovite may also be synthesized by duplicating these conditions in the laboratory, either isostatically or through shock (see [[shocked quartz]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Discovery of hardest known oxide|year=1996|journal=Nature|volume=383|pages=401|doi=10.1038/383401a0 |author=J.

'''Tetrahydrocannabinol''' ('''THC''') is one of at least 113 [[cannabinoid]]s identified in [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. THC is the principal [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] constituent of cannabis. With chemical name '''(−)-''trans''-Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol''', the term ''THC'' also refers to cannabinoid [[isomers]].

Like most pharmacologically-active [[secondary metabolite]]s of plants, THC is a ''[[lipid]]'' found in cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;Firn, Richard (2010). Nature's Chemicals.

THC, along with its double bond isomers and their [[Stereoisomerism|stereoisomers]], is one of only three cannabinoids scheduled by the UN [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] (the other two are [[dimethylheptylpyran]] and [[parahexyl]]). It was listed under Schedule I in 1971, but reclassified to Schedule II in 1991 following a recommendation from the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]. Based on subsequent studies, the WHO has recommended the reclassification to the less-stringent Schedule III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tni.org/en/publication/the-un-drug-control-conventions#box3|title=The UN Drug Control Conventions|date=8 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannabis as a plant is scheduled by the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] (Schedule I and IV). It is specifically still listed under Schedule I by US federal law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml|title=Drug Schedules; Schedule 1|publisher=US Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice|date=1 December 2017|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] for having "no accepted medical use" and "lack of accepted safety". However, [[Dronabinol]] is a synthetic form of THC approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] as an appetite stimulant for people with [[AIDS]] and [[antiemetic]] for people receiving [[chemotherapy]].&lt;ref name="fda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marinol (Dronabinol)|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2005/018651s021lbl.pdf|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pharmaceutical formulation]] dronabinol is an oily [[resin]] provided in [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]] available by [[prescription drug|prescription]] in the United States, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand.

{{See also|Effects of cannabis|Long-term effects of cannabis|Cannabis in pregnancy}}

=== Mechanism of action ===
{{For|a review of the mechanisms behind endocannabinoid synaptic transmission|Endocannabinoid system}}
The actions of THC result from its partial [[agonist]] activity at the [[cannabinoid receptor]] [[Cannabinoid receptor type 1|CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] (K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 nM&lt;ref name="PDSP Database"&gt;{{cite web |title=PDSP Database – UNC |url=http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php? |publisher=NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program |accessdate=11 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108013656/http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php |archivedate=8 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), located mainly in the [[central nervous system]], and the [[Cannabinoid receptor type 2|CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] receptor (K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 24 nM&lt;ref name="PDSP Database" /&gt;), mainly expressed in cells of the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="pmid16570099"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pertwee RG | title = The pharmacology of cannabinoid receptors and their ligands: An overview | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 30 | pages = S13–S18 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16570099 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0803272 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychoactive effects of THC are primarily mediated by the activation of [[cannabinoid receptor]]s, which result in a decrease in the concentration of the second messenger molecule [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] through inhibition of [[adenylate cyclase]].&lt;ref name="pmid11316486"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elphick MR, Egertová M | title = The neurobiology and evolution of cannabinoid signalling | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 356 | issue = 1407 | pages = 381–408 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11316486 | pmc = 1088434 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2000.0787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of these specialized cannabinoid receptors in the [[brain]] led researchers to the discovery of [[endocannabinoids]], such as [[anandamide]] and 2-arachidonoyl glyceride ([[2-AG]]). THC targets receptors in a manner far less selective than endocannabinoid molecules released during [[retrograde signaling]], as the drug has a relatively low cannabinoid receptor efficacy and affinity. In populations of low cannabinoid receptor density, THC may act to antagonize endogenous agonists that possess greater receptor efficacy.&lt;ref name="pmid17828291"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pertwee RG | title = The diverse CB1 and CB2 receptor pharmacology of three plant cannabinoids: Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 153 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–215 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17828291 | pmc = 2219532 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0707442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; THC is a [[lipophilic]] molecule&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rashidi H, Akhtar MT, van der Kooy F, Verpoorte R, Duetz WA | title = Hydroxylation and Further Oxidation of Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol by Alkane-Degrading Bacteria | journal = Appl Environ Microbiol | volume = 75 | issue = 22 | pages = 7135–7141 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19767471 | pmc = 2786519 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.01277-09 | url = http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19767471 | quote = Δ9-THC and many of its derivatives are highly lipophilic and poorly water soluble.

THC, similarly to cannabidiol, albeit less potently, is a positive [[allosteric modulator]] of the [[μ-opioid receptor|μ-]] and [[δ-opioid receptor]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid16489449"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kathmann M, Flau K, Redmer A, Tränkle C, Schlicker E | title = Cannabidiol is an allosteric modulator at mu- and delta-opioid receptors | journal = Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. | volume = 372 | issue = 5 | pages = 354–61 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16489449 | doi = 10.1007/s00210-006-0033-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its partial agonistic activity, THC appears to result in greater [[downregulation]] of cannabinoid receptors than [[endocannabinoid]]s, further limiting its efficacy over other cannabinoids. While tolerance may limit the maximal effects of certain drugs, evidence suggests that tolerance develops irregularly for different effects with greater resistance for primary over side-effects, and may actually serve to enhance the drug's therapeutic window.&lt;ref name="pmid17828291" /&gt; However, this form of tolerance appears to be irregular throughout mouse brain areas.
THC, as well as other cannabinoids that contain a phenol group, possesses mild [[antioxidant]] activity sufficient to protect neurons against [[oxidative stress]], such as that produced by [[glutamate]]-induced [[excitotoxicity]].&lt;ref name="pmid16570099" /&gt;

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
THC is metabolized mainly to [[11-Hydroxy-THC|11-OH-THC]] by the body. This [[metabolite]] is still psychoactive and is further oxidized to [[11-nor-9-carboxy-THC]] (THC-COOH). In humans and animals, more than 100 metabolites could be identified, but 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH are the dominating metabolites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aizpurua-Olaizola|first=Oier|last2=Zarandona|first2=Iratxe|last3=Ortiz|first3=Laura|last4=Navarro|first4=Patricia|last5=Etxebarria|first5=Nestor|last6=Usobiaga|first6=Aresatz|date=2016-01-01|title=Simultaneous quantification of major cannabinoids and metabolites in human urine and plasma by HPLC-MS/MS and enzyme-alkaline hydrolysis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dta.1998/abstract|journal=Drug Testing and Analysis|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1002/dta.1998|issn=1942-7611}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metabolism occurs mainly in the liver by [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C19]], and [[CYP3A4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe K, Yamaori S, Funahashi T, Kimura T, Yamamoto I | title = Cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of tetrahydrocannabinols and cannabinol by human hepatic microsomes | journal = Life Science | volume = 80 | issue = 15 | pages = 1415–9 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17303175 | doi = 10.1016/j.lfs.2006.12.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 55% of THC is excreted in the [[feces]] and ≈20% in the [[urine]].

==Physical and chemical properties==

===Discovery and structure identification===
In 1940, cannabidiol was isolated and identified from ''Cannabis sativa'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01858a058 | doi=10.1021/ja01858a058 | volume=62 | title=Structure of Cannabidiol, a Product Isolated from the Marihuana Extract of Minnesota Wild Hemp. | year=1940 | journal= 	Journal of the American Chemical Society | pages=196–200 | author=Roger Adams, Madison Hunt, J. H. Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; and THC was isolated and described for its structure and synthesis in 1964.&lt;ref name="doi10.1021/ja01062a046"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid4910003"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mechoulam R | title = Marihuana chemistry | journal = Science | volume = 168 | issue = 3936 | pages = 1159–66 | year = 1970 | pmid = 4910003 | doi = 10.1126/science.168.3936.1159 | bibcode = 1970Sci...168.1159M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solubility===
As with many [[aromatic]] [[terpenoid]]s, THC has a very low [[solubility]] in water, but good solubility in most organic [[solvent]]s, specifically [[lipid]]s and [[alcohol]]s.&lt;ref name='Garrett1974'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garrett ER, Hunt CA | title = Physicochemical properties, solubility, and protein binding of Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrocannabinol | journal = J. Pharm. Sci. | volume = 63 | issue = 7 | pages = 1056–64 | date = July 1974 | pmid = 4853640 | doi = 10.1002/jps.2600630705 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Total synthesis===
A [[total synthesis]] of the compound was reported in 1965; that procedure called for the intramolecular alkyl lithium attack on a starting [[Carbonyl group|carbonyl]] to form the fused rings, and a [[tosyl chloride]] mediated formation of the ether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mechoulam R, Gaoni Y | year = 1965 | title =  A Total Synthesis of dl-Δ1-Tetrahydrocannabinol, the Active Constituent of Hashish| url = | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 87 | issue = 14| pages = 3273–3275 | doi=10.1021/ja01092a065}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=March 2017}}

=== Biosynthesis ===
[[File:THC-COOH biosynthesis v2.svg|thumb|512px|Biosynthesis of THCA]]
In the ''[[Cannabis]]'' plant, THC occurs mainly as [[tetrahydrocannabinolic acid]] (THCA, 2-COOH-THC, THC-COOH). [[Geranyl pyrophosphate]] and [[olivetol]]ic acid react, catalysed by an [[enzyme]] to produce [[cannabigerol]]ic acid,&lt;ref name="pmid9607329"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fellermeier M, Zenk MH | title = Prenylation of olivetolate by a hemp transferase yields cannabigerolic acid, the precursor of tetrahydrocannabinol | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 427 | issue = 2 | pages = 283–5 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9607329 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-5793(98)00450-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is cyclized by the enzyme [[THC acid synthase]] to give THCA. Over time, or when heated, THCA is [[decarboxylation|decarboxylated]], producing THC. The pathway for THCA [[biosynthesis]] is similar to that which produces the bitter acid [[humulone]] in [[hops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marks MD, Tian L, Wenger JP, Omburo SN, Soto-Fuentes W, He J, Gang DR, Weiblen GD, Dixon RA | title = Identification of candidate genes affecting Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol biosynthesis in Cannabis sativa | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 60 | issue = 13 | pages = 3715–26 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19581347 | pmc = 2736886 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erp210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baker PB, Taylor BJ, Gough TA | title = The tetrahydrocannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinolic acid content of cannabis products | journal = J Pharm Pharmacol. | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 369–72 | date = June 1981 | pmid = 6115009 | doi = 10.1111/j.2042-7158.1981.tb13806.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detection in body fluids ===
{{Main|Cannabis drug testing}}
THC and its 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH metabolites can be detected and quantified in blood, urine, hair, oral fluid or sweat using a combination of [[immunoassay]] and [[chromatographic]] techniques as part of a drug use testing program or in a forensic investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwilke EW, Schwope DM, Karschner EL, Lowe RH, Darwin WD, Kelly DL, Goodwin RS, Gorelick DA, Huestis MA | title = Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), 11-Hydroxy-THC, and 11-Nor-9-carboxy-THC Plasma Pharmacokinetics during and after Continuous High-Dose Oral THC | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 55 | issue = 12 | pages = 2180–2189 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19833841 | pmc = 3196989 | doi = 10.1373/clinchem.2008.122119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Röhrich J, Schimmel I, Zörntlein S, Becker J, Drobnik S, Kaufmann T, Kuntz V, Urban R | title = Concentrations of Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-Tetrahydrocannabinol and 11-Nor-9-Carboxytetrahydrocannabinol in Blood and Urine After Passive Exposure to Cannabis Smoke in a Coffee Shop | journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 196–203 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20465865 | doi = 10.1093/jat/34.4.196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=R. |last1=Baselt |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=9th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Seal Beach, CA |year=2011 |pages=1644–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its 33rd meeting, in 2003, the [[World Health Organization]] Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended transferring THC to [[Amphetamine-type stimulants|Schedule IV]] of the Convention, citing its medical uses and low abuse potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/right_committee/en/index.html |title=WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation in Canada===
As of October 2018 when recreational use of cannabis was legalized in Canada, some 220 [[dietary supplement]]s and 19 [[Holistic veterinary medicine|veterinary health products]] containing not more than 10 parts per million of THC [[extract]] were approved with general [[health claim]]s for treating minor conditions.&lt;ref name=canada2018/&gt;

==Research==
The status of THC as an illegal drug in most countries imposes restrictions on research material supply and funding, such as in the United States where the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] and [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] regulated sources of cannabis for researchers until August 2016 when licenses were provided to growers for supplies of medical marijuana.&lt;ref name="MAPS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maps.org/research/mmj/ |title=Medical Marijuana |publisher=Multidisciplinary Association for Psychoactive Substances |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although cannabis is legalized for medical uses in half of the United States, no products have been approved for federal commerce by the Food and Drug Administration, a status that limits cultivation, manufacture, distribution, clinical research, and therapeutic applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=28169144|year=2017|author1=Mead|first1=A|title=The legal status of cannabis (marijuana) and cannabidiol (CBD) under U.S. Law|journal=Epilepsy &amp; Behavior|volume=70|issue=Pt B|pages=288–291|doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2016.11.021|url=http://www.epilepsybehavior.com/article/S1525-5050(16)30585-6/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the [[American Academy of Neurology]] found evidence supporting the effectiveness of the cannabis extracts in treating certain symptoms of [[multiple sclerosis]] and pain, but there was insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness for treating several other neurological diseases.&lt;ref name="AAN"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koppel BS, Brust JC, Fife T, Bronstein J, Youssof S, Gronseth G, Gloss D | title = Systematic review: Efficacy and safety of medical marijuana in selected neurologic disorders: Report of the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology | journal = Neurology | volume = 82 | issue = 17 | pages = 1556–63 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24778283 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000363 |pmc=4011465}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 review confirmed that medical marijuana was effective for treating spasticity and chronic pain, but caused numerous short-lasting [[adverse event]]s, such as [[euphoria]] and dizziness.&lt;ref name="whiting"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=26103030|year=2015|author1=Whiting|first1=P.

===Multiple sclerosis symptoms===
* ''Spasticity''. Based on the results of 3 high quality trials and 5 of lower quality, oral cannabis extract was rated as effective, and THC as probably effective, for improving people's subjective experience of spasticity. Oral cannabis extract and THC both were rated as possibly effective for improving objective measures of spasticity.&lt;ref name="AAN"/&gt;&lt;ref name=whiting/&gt;
* ''Centrally mediated pain and painful spasms''.  Based on the results of 4 high quality trials and 4 low quality trials, oral cannabis extract was rated as effective, and THC as probably effective in treating central pain and painful spasms.&lt;ref name="AAN"/&gt;
* ''Bladder dysfunction''. Based on a single high quality study, oral cannabis extract and THC were rated as probably ineffective for controlling bladder complaints in multiple sclerosis&lt;ref name="AAN"/&gt;

===Neurodegenerative disorders===
* ''Huntington disease''. No reliable conclusions could be drawn regarding the effectiveness of THC or oral cannabis extract in treating the symptoms of Huntington disease as the available trials were too small to reliably detect any difference&lt;ref name="AAN"/&gt;
* ''Parkinson's disease''.  Based on a single study, oral CBD extract was rated probably ineffective in treating levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name="AAN"/&gt;
* ''Alzheimer's disease''. A 2011 Cochrane Review found insufficient evidence to conclude whether cannabis products have any utility in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krishnan S, Cairns R, Howard R | title = Cannabinoids for the treatment of dementia | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD007204 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19370677 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007204.pub2  | editor1-last = Krishnan | editor1-first = Sarada }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other neurological disorders===
* ''Tourette syndrome''. The available data was determined to be insufficient to allow reliable conclusions to be drawn regarding the effectiveness of oral cannabis extract or THC in controlling tics.&lt;ref name="AAN"/&gt;
* ''Cervical dystonia''. Insufficient data was available to assess the effectiveness of oral cannabis extract of THC in treating cervical dystonia.&lt;ref name="AAN"/&gt;
* ''Epilepsy''. Data was considered insufficient to judge the utility of cannabis products in reducing seizure frequency or severity.&lt;ref name="AAN"/&gt;

[[Cossacks]] founded an [[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] in 1638,&lt;ref name="gr"&gt;{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|90|km|sp=us}} southwest of the modern town. The ostrog's name "Verkhoyansky", roughly translating from Russian as ''the town on the Upper Yana'', derived from its geographical location on the upper reaches of the [[Yana River]]. In 1775, it was moved to the left bank of the Yana River to facilitate tax collection. It was granted town status in 1817.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Between the 1860s and 1917, the town was a place of political exile, with some of the more prominent exiles including the [[Poles|Polish]] writer [[Wacław Sieroszewski]], as well as Bolshevik revolutionaries [[Ivan Babushkin]] and [[Viktor Nogin]].

==Administrative and municipal status==
As an [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|inhabited locality]], Verkhoyansk is classified as a town under district jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="SakhaR_admlist"&gt;''Registry of the Administrative-Territorial Divisions of the Sakha Republic''&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is incorporated within [[Verkhoyansky District]] as the '''[[Town of district significance|Town]] of Verkhoyansk'''.&lt;ref name="SakhaR_admlist" /&gt; As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the Town of Verkhoyansk is incorporated within Verkhoyansky Municipal District as '''Verkhoyansk Urban Settlement'''.&lt;ref name="Ref531"&gt;Law #173-Z #353-III&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy and infrastructure ==
There is a [[inland port|river port]], an [[airport]], a [[fur]]-collecting depot, and the center of a [[reindeer]]-raising area. It is also home to the [http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2541140-d2622677-Reviews-Pole_of_Cold_District_Museum_of_Local_Lore-Verkhoyansk_Sakha_Yakutia_Republic_Fa.html Pole of Cold Museum.]

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Verkhoyansk is notable chiefly for its exceptionally low winter temperatures and some of the greatest temperature differences on Earth between summer and winter. Average monthly temperatures range from {{convert|-45.4|C}} in January to {{convert|+16.5|C}} in July. Mean monthly temperatures are below freezing from October through April and exceed {{convert|+10|C}} from June through August, with the intervening months of May and September constituting very short transitional seasons. Verkhoyansk has an extreme [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfd'') dominated much of the year by [[anticyclone|high pressure]]. This has the effect of cutting off the region from warming influences in winter and together with a lack of cloud cover leads to extensive heat losses during the cooler months.

Verkhoyansk is one of the places considered the northern [[Pole of Cold]], the others being [[Oymyakon]], located 629 km (391 miles) away by air, and [[Delyankir]]. The lowest temperature recorded there, in February 1892, was {{convert|-67.6|C|1}}, recorded on February 5 and 7.&lt;ref name="Stepanova"&gt;{{cite web|author=N. A. Stepanova
|title=On the Lowest Temperatures on Earth|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/086/mwr-086-01-0006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burt"&gt;Weather Underground - The Coldest Places on Earth https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/the-coldest-places-on-earth&lt;/ref&gt; This was formerly the coldest officially recorded temperature in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. However, on February 6, 1933, the temperature at Oymyakon reached {{convert|-67.7|C|1}}, just barely exceeding Verkhoyansk's record.&lt;ref name="Stepanova"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burt"/&gt; Only Antarctica has recorded [[Lowest_temperature_recorded_on_Earth|lower temperatures]] than Oymyakon or Verkhoyansk: the lowest directly recorded temperature at ground level is {{convert|-89.2|C}}, recorded at the [[Vostok Station]] in [[Antarctica]] on July&amp;nbsp;21, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Weather &amp; Climate Extremes|url=http://wmo.asu.edu/#global|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World: Lowest Temperature |url=http://wmo.asu.edu/world-lowest-temperature |publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]] |accessdate=December 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616025722/http://wmo.asu.edu/world-lowest-temperature |archivedate=June 16, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and a temperature of {{convert|-93.2|C}} was recorded via satellite observations at the [[East Antarctic Plateau]] in [[Antarctica]] on August 10, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Coldest Place in the World|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/09dec_coldspot|publisher=NASA|accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this area, [[inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversions]] consistently form in winter due to the extremely cold and dense air of the [[Siberian High]] pooling in deep hollows, so that temperatures increase rather than decrease with higher altitude. In Verkhoyansk it sometimes happens that the average minimum temperatures for January, February, and December are below {{convert|−50|C}}. Oymyakon and Verkhoyansk are the only two permanently populated places in the world that have recorded temperatures below {{convert|-60.0|C}} every day of January.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In June, July, and August, daytime temperatures over {{convert|+30|C}} are not uncommon. The warmest month on record is July 2001, at {{convert|+21.9|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;GHCN monthly climate data; Goddard Institute of Space Studies record for Verhojansk 1885-2010&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature for Verkhoyansk is {{convert|-14.5|C}}. On July&amp;nbsp;25, 1988, Verkhoyansk recorded a temperature of {{convert|+37.3|C}}, yielding a temperature range of {{convert|105|C-change}} based on reliable records, which is the greatest temperature range in the world. Oymyakon, Delyankir, and Yakutsk are the only other places in the world with a temperature range higher than {{convert|100|C-change}}. Verkhoyansk has never recorded a temperature above freezing between November&amp;nbsp;10 and March&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weather and Climate - Climate Monitor: The weather in Verkhoyansk|url=http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/monitor.php?id=24266&amp;month=11&amp;year=2013|publisher=www.pogodaiklimat.ru|accessdate=December 25, 2013|language=Russian}} Daily records on the right of the page; December–March records can be accessed via buttons at the bottom of the page.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verkhoyansk has a dry climate with little rainfall or snowfall: the average annual [[precipitation]] is {{convert|180|mm|sp=us}}. Although no month can be described as truly wet, there are strong seasonal differences in precipitation, with the summer being much wetter than the winter. Winter precipitation is extremely light, largely because of the dominance of high pressure at this time of year.

'''Waveskis''' (also known as "Sit on top surf kayaks, or SOTs) are a type of surf kayak that allows the rider to 'sit on top' instead of having to sit in it. Waveski surfing is a dynamic sport combining the paddle power of a [[sit on top kayak]] with the manoeuvrability and performance of a [[surfboard]]. A Waveski resembles a larger surfboard, with the addition of a seat, fins, foot straps, and seat belt, enabling the rider to '[[eskimo roll]]' if overturned.  The waveski rider or waveski surfer uses a double ended [[kayak paddle]] for motion while seated in the waveski.

==History==
The origins are obscure, but waveskis have been around for over forty years.  [[Danny Broadhurst]], a [[Long Island]], New York, surfer created some early waveskis in the 1970s, although these were heavy, bulky and not particularly manoeuvrable{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}. The sport experienced its major growth in the 1980s with manufactures like [[Macski]] being a dominant force in the market exporting worldwide to countries such as Australia, USA as well as into Europe. Original boards had wooden frames covered in glass fibre then became foam injected and soon custom hand made boards were being shaped and glassed out of polystyrene foam and epoxy resins. Contemporary boards are shaped in precision CNC machines and weigh around {{Convert|6|kg}} when completed{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}.

==Description==
Many of the manoeuvres waveskiers have been performing since the 1980s are only now becoming mainstream moves in surfing, where they were mocked in days gone by surfers, maneuvers such as aerials, flip aerials and various other radical moves one can do on a wave. The sport is experiencing a resurgence in countries such as Brazil and France tying in with the river and [[sea kayak]] sports and holding joint competitions as they share a common functionality{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}. More junior riders and sponsors are needed to see larger coverage of this sport{{according to whom|date=January 2016}}. Competitions are similar to stand up surfing ones and are judged on the performance of the rider on the waves within a 20-minute heat.

==Equipment==
There are several kinds of waveskis, including the shorter and "fatter" Australian style ski, used for high performance "slash and burn" surfing, and American style waveskis perhaps epitomized by Steve Boehne's Infinity Surf Shop skis.  There are also skegless skis for performing tricks, and even tandem skis. The "Jbay" wave ski shape has become the predominant shape of a ski nowadays with riders positioned further back on the ski for better maneuverability. High performance skis weigh {{Convert|6-8|kg}} and are custom made, using [[epoxy]] resin and EPS foam, which makes the waveski light and strong{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}. The sport provides fun and exercise for beginners through to advanced riders. A waveski is not to be confused with a [[surf ski]].  Waveskis are designed for surfing ocean waves and surf skis are designed for racing in open water, as seen in [[Magnum P.I.]], the Tom Selleck TV series.
