An '''acting coach''' or '''drama coach''' is a [[teacher]] who trains performers–typically film, television, theatre and, [[musical theatre]] [[actor]]s–and gives them advice and [[mentoring]] to enable them to improve their acting and dramatic performances, prepare for [[audition]]s and prepare better for roles.
==Qualifications and roles==
Acting coaches need to have a "talent...for reading people, all their utterances and [[body language]]."&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;Eric Liu. "The People Whisperers:What a Hollywood acting coach taught me about teaching" in Slate. http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/teachings/2005/01/the_people_whisperers.html&lt;/ref&gt; Acting coaches have been called "people whisperers", a reference to "[[horse whisperer]]s" who help to train animals.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Acting coach [[Ivana Chubbuck]] states that one of her roles is to ensure that "every actor...must know what the character's objective is in a scene—to win someone's love, respect, sympathy, whatever—and then must have a ruthlessness about achieving the objective."&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Chubbuck works with actors to help them to connect with the emotion inside the character.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Acting coaches also "...help [drama] students audition for college".&lt;ref name=mcmahon&gt;Regan McMahon. "THEATER Acting coach preps drama students for college auditions" in ''The Chronicle'' Saturday, January 22, 2011 http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Acting-coaches-help-students-audition-for-college-2478509.php&lt;/ref&gt; Acting coach and actor Woodell-Mascall is "...skilled at zeroing in on what young actors need to do to improve their performance." Woodell-Mascall tells one student actor to "...really think about who [the character] is and what she's feeling. It's got to be real.&lt;ref name=mcmahon /&gt; She provides [[constructive criticism]] to students. Woodell-Mascall has helped students to get into drama programs at schools "...including NYU, Juilliard, Rutgers and UCLA".&lt;ref name=mcmahon /&gt; Some acting coaches use an "...approach and technique of acting training [that] are considered established, proven methods of creating the [dramatic] work", such as using the "...methodology of [[Constantin Stanislavski]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Uta Hagen]], [[Lee Strasberg]], and [[Sanford Meisner]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://kimtobinactingstudio.com/faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some acting coaches provide students with a DVD or SD card recording of their acting, for the student to review their progress.

==Notable individuals==
Major acting coaches include: [[Larry Moss (acting coach)|Larry Moss]], [[Ivana Chubbuck]], [[Michelle Danner]], [[Terry Schreiber]], [[David Mamet]], [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Michael Woolson]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Chambers Stevens]], and [[Sanford Meisner]].

==Working conditions==
Acting coaches may be freelancers who are hired for an hourly or daily rate, or they may be hired on a longer-term basis by a [[film studio]], [[production company]] or [[theatre company]]. Some acting coaches have developed their own unique methods and founded their own acting schools. Acting coaches' income varies a great deal from one coach to another. For example, an acting coach providing training to a community theatre troupe or a high school musical earns much less than an acting coach training top [[Hollywood]] celebrities. Acting classes are often provided in person; however, with the widespread availability of high-speed Internet, some coaches offer mentoring online over [[Skype]] or other video linkups. Acting coaches may offer private coaching, group sessions or a combination of both.

==Other roles==
In some cases, acting coaches are hired to train [[singer]]s in acting skills. Popular music singers may need to learn acting skills for their live concert shows, which sometimes include staged sequences, and for performing in [[music video]]s. For example, Goth-rocker [[Amy Lee]] was provided with an acting coach by her record label. In [[Classical music]], singers performing staged [[opera]]s may get help from an acting coach to prepare them for their roles. Sometimes CEOs and other leaders hire acting coaches to help them improve their performance of speeches and other general communications activities. While most acting coaches mentor actors, some also coach directors on how to improve their direction of actors. Some acting coaches offer introductions to the acting industry, to help new actors learn about auditions, the casting process, the role of agents, key acting terminology (e.g., "[[wikt:callback|callback]]" auditions), and about important industry organizations.

==Background==
The concept of the oceanic anoxic event (OAE) was first proposed in 1976 by Seymour Schlanger (1927–1990) and geologist Hugh Jenkyns&lt;ref name="HistOfOil-2"&gt;History Channel, "The History of Oil" (2007), Australian Broadcasting System, Inc.&lt;!--may be out of context --&gt;, aired: 2:00-4:00 pm EDST, 2008-07-08; Note: [[Geologist]] Hugh Jenkyns was interviewed in the History Channel's (re: footnote:3 History Channel, "The History of Oil" (2007)) documentary "The History of Oil" and attributed the matching occurrence high in the [[Apennine Mountains]]' meter thick black shale band put together with the findings from the [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] as triggering the theory and work that followed from a beginning ca 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; and arose from discoveries made by the [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] (DSDP) in the Pacific Ocean. It was the finding of black carbon-rich shales in Cretaceous sediments that had accumulated on submarine [[volcanic plateau]]s ([[Shatsky Rise]], [[Manihiki Plateau]]), coupled with the fact that they were identical in age with similar deposits cored from the Atlantic Ocean and known from outcrops in Europe - particularly in the geological record of the otherwise limestone-dominated [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]&lt;ref name="HistOfOil-2"/&gt; chain in Italy - that led to the realization that these widespread similar [[stratigraphy|strata]] recorded highly unusual oxygen-depleted conditions in the world ocean during several discrete periods of [[geological time scale|geological time]].

Sedimentological investigations of these organic-rich sediments, which have continued to this day, typically reveal the presence of fine laminations undisturbed by bottom-dwelling fauna, indicating anoxic conditions on the sea floor, believed to be coincident with a low lying poisonous layer of hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; Furthermore, detailed organic [[geochemical]] studies have recently revealed the presence of molecules (so-called biomarkers) that derive from both [[purple sulfur bacteria]]&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; and [[green sulfur bacteria]]: organisms that required both light and free [[hydrogen sulfide|hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S)]], illustrating that anoxic conditions extended high into the illuminated upper water column.

There are currently several places on earth that are exhibiting the features of anoxic events on a localized scale such as algal/bacterial blooms and localized "dead zones". [[Dead zone (ecology)|Dead zones]] exist off the East Coast of the United States in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], in the Scandinavian strait [[Kattegat]], the [[Black Sea]] (which may have been anoxic in its deepest levels for millennia, however), in the northern Adriatic as well as a dead zone off the coast of Louisiana. The current{{When|date=May 2016}} surge of [[jellyfish]] worldwide is sometimes regarded as the first stirrings of an anoxic event{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Other marine dead zones have appeared in coastal waters of South America, China, Japan, and [[New Zealand]]. A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080814154325.htm]

This is a recent understanding. This picture was only pieced together during the last three decades{{When|date=May 2016}}. The handful of known and suspected anoxic events have been tied geologically to large-scale production of the world's oil reserves in worldwide bands of black [[shale]] in the [[geologic record]]. Likewise the high relative temperatures believed linked to so called "[[super-greenhouse event]]s".&lt;ref

===Euxinia===
{{See also|Phosphorus cycle}}
Oceanic '''anoxic events''' with [[Euxinia|euxinic]] (i.e. sulfidic) conditions have been linked to extreme episodes of volcanic outgassing. Thus, volcanism contributed to the buildup of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere, increased global temperatures, causing an accelerated hydrological cycle that introduced nutrients to the oceans to stimulate planktonic productivity. These processes potentially acted as a trigger for euxinia in restricted basins where water-column stratification could develop. Under anoxic to euxinic conditions, oceanic phosphate is not retained in sediment and could hence be released and recycled, aiding continued high productivity.&lt;ref name="Kump 2008" /&gt;

Temperatures throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous are generally thought to have been relatively warm, and consequently dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean were lower than today - making anoxia easier to achieve. However, more specific conditions are required to explain the short-period (less than a million years) oceanic anoxic events. Two hypotheses, and variations upon them, have proved most durable.

One hypothesis suggests that the anomalous accumulation of organic matter relates to its enhanced preservation under restricted and poorly oxygenated conditions, which themselves were a function of the particular geometry of the ocean basin: such a hypothesis, although readily applicable to the young and relatively narrow Cretaceous Atlantic (which could be likened to a large-scale Black Sea, only poorly connected to the World Ocean), fails to explain the occurrence of coeval black shales on open-ocean Pacific plateaus and shelf seas around the world.  There are suggestions, again from the Atlantic, that a shift in oceanic circulation was responsible, where warm, salty waters at low latitudes became hypersaline and sank to form an intermediate layer, at {{convert|500|to|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} depth, with a temperature of {{convert|20|C|F|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|25|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ngeo217"&gt;{{cite journal

|last5=Kuhnert|issue=7|bibcode=2008NatGe...1..453F
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second hypothesis suggests that oceanic anoxic events record a major change in the fertility of the oceans that resulted in an increase in organic-walled plankton (including bacteria) at the expense of calcareous plankton such as [[coccoliths]] and [[foraminifera]].
Such an accelerated flux of organic matter would have expanded and intensified the [[oxygen minimum zone]], further enhancing the amount of organic carbon entering the sedimentary record. Essentially this mechanism assumes a major increase in the availability of dissolved nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and possibly iron to the phytoplankton population living in the illuminated layers of the oceans.

For such an increase to occur would have required an accelerated influx of land-derived nutrients coupled with vigorous [[upwelling]], requiring major climate change on a global scale. Geochemical data from oxygen-[[isotope]] ratios in carbonate sediments and fossils, and magnesium/calcium ratios in fossils, indicate that all major oceanic anoxic events were associated with thermal maxima, making it likely that global weathering rates, and nutrient flux to the oceans, were increased during these intervals.  Indeed, the reduced solubility of oxygen would lead to phosphate release, further nourishing the ocean and fuelling high productivity, hence a high oxygen demand - sustaining the event through a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="10.1146.2Fannurev.earth.36.031207.124256"/&gt;

Here is another way of looking at oceanic anoxic events.  Assume that the earth releases a huge volume of carbon dioxide during an interval of intense volcanism; global temperatures rise due to the [[greenhouse effect]]; global weathering rates and fluvial nutrient flux increase; organic productivity in the oceans increases; organic-[[Carbon sequestration|carbon burial]] in the oceans increases (OAE begins); carbon dioxide is drawn down due to both burial of organic matter and weathering of silicate rocks (inverse greenhouse effect); global temperatures fall, and the ocean–atmosphere system returns to equilibrium (OAE ends).

In this way, an oceanic anoxic event can be viewed as the Earth’s response to the injection of excess carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and [[hydrosphere]].  One test of this notion is to look at the age of [[large igneous province]]s (LIPs), the extrusion of which would presumably have been accompanied by rapid effusion of vast quantities of volcanogenic gases such as carbon dioxide.  Intriguingly, the age of three LIPs ([[Karoo-Ferrar]] flood basalt, [[Caribbean large igneous province]], [[Ontong Java Plateau]]) correlates uncannily well with that of the major [[Jurassic]] (early [[Toarcian]]) and Cretaceous (early [[Aptian extinction|Aptian]] and [[Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event|Cenomanian–Turonian]]) oceanic anoxic events, indicating that a causal link is feasible.

==Occurrence==
Oceanic anoxic events most commonly occurred during periods of very warm [[climate]] characterized by high levels of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and mean surface temperatures probably in excess of {{Convert|25|°C}}. The [[Quaternary]] levels, the current [[period (geology)|period]], are just {{Convert|13|°C}} in comparison. Such rises in carbon dioxide may have been in response to a great outgassing of the highly flammable [[natural gas]] (methane) that some call an "oceanic burp".&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt;&lt;ref

|quote=With extreme weather continuing to bite -- hurricanes may increase in power by half a category above today’s top-level Category Five -- world food supplies will be critically endangered. :And: The Eocene greenhouse event fascinates scientists not just because of its effects, which also saw a major mass-extinction in the seas, but also because of its likely cause: [[methane hydrate]]s. This unlikely substance, a sort of ice-like combination of methane and water that is only stable at low temperatures and high pressure, may have burst into the atmosphere from the seabed in an immense '''“ocean burp”''', sparking a surge in global temperatures (methane is even more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide). Today vast amounts of these same methane hydrates still sit on sub-sea continental shelves. As the oceans warm, they could be released once more in a terrifying echo of that methane belch of 55 million years ago.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vast quantities of [[methane]] are normally locked into the Earth's crust on the continental plateaus in one of the many deposits consisting of compounds of [[methane hydrate]], a solid precipitated combination of methane and water much like ice. Because the methane hydrates are unstable, except at cool temperatures and high (deep) pressures, scientists have observed smaller "burps" due to [[tectonic]] events.  Studies suggest the huge release of natural gas&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; could be a major climatological trigger, methane itself being a [[greenhouse gas]] many times more powerful than carbon dioxide.  However, anoxia was also rife during the [[Hirnantian]] (late Ordovician) ice age.

The [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] (PETM), which was characterized by a global rise in temperature and deposition of organic-rich shales in some shelf seas, shows many similarities to oceanic anoxic events.

Typically, oceanic anoxic events lasted for less than a million years, before a full recovery.

==Consequences==
Oceanic anoxic events have had many important consequences. It is believed that they have been responsible for mass [[extinction events|extinctions]] of marine organisms both in the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]].&lt;ref name="10.1146.2Fannurev.earth.36.031207.124256"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = K. M.| first2 = L.

  |bibcode = 2008AREPS..36..251M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Toarcian and [[Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event]]s correlate with the [[Toarcian turnover|Toarcian]] and [[Cenomanian-Turonian extinction event]]s of mostly marine life forms. Apart from possible atmospheric effects, many deeper-dwelling marine organisms could not adapt to an ocean where oxygen penetrated only the surface layers.

An economically significant consequence of oceanic anoxic events is the fact that the prevailing conditions in so many Mesozoic oceans has helped produce most of the world's [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves. During an oceanic anoxic event, the accumulation and preservation of organic matter was much greater than normal, allowing the generation of potential petroleum [[source rock]]s in many environments across the globe. Consequently, some 70 percent of oil source rocks are Mesozoic in age, and another 15 percent date from the warm Paleogene: only rarely in colder periods were conditions favorable for the production of source rocks on anything other than a local scale.

===Atmospheric effects===
A model put forward by Lee Kump, Alexander Pavlov and Michael Arthur in 2005 suggests that oceanic anoxic events may have been characterized by upwelling of water rich in highly toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which was then released into the atmosphere. This phenomenon would probably have poisoned plants and animals and caused mass extinctions. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the hydrogen sulfide rose to the upper atmosphere and attacked the [[ozone layer]], which normally blocks the deadly [[ultraviolet radiation]] of the [[Sun]]. The increased UV radiation caused by this [[ozone depletion]] would have amplified the destruction of plant and animal life. Fossil spores from strata recording the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] show deformities consistent with UV radiation. This evidence, combined with fossil [[Bioindicator|biomarker]]s of [[green sulfur bacteria]], indicates that this process could have played a role in that [[mass extinction]] event, and possibly other extinction events. The trigger for these mass extinctions appears to be a warming of the ocean caused by a rise of carbon dioxide levels to about 1000 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocean chemistry effects===
Reduced oxygen levels are expected to lead to increased seawater concentrations of redox-sensitive metals. The reductive dissolution of [[iron]]–[[manganese]] oxyhydroxides in seafloor sediments under low-oxygen conditions would release those metals and associated trace metals. Sulfate reduction in such sediments could release other metals such as [[barium]]. When heavy-metal-rich anoxic deep water entered continental shelves and encountered increased O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, precipitation of some of the metals, as well as poisoning of the local biota, would have occurred. In the late Silurian mid-[[Silurian#Pridoli|Pridoli]] event, increases are seen in the Fe, Cu, As, Al, Pb, Ba, Mo and Mn levels in shallow-water sediment and microplankton; this is associated with a marked increase in the malformation rate in [[chitinozoan]]s and other microplankton types, likely due to metal toxicity.&lt;ref name="Vandenbroucke2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vandenbroucke|first1=T.

==Anoxic events in Earth's history==

===Cretaceous===
{{Main|Cretaceous}}
{{See also|Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event}}
Sulfidic (or euxinic) conditions, which exist today in many [[water bodies]] from [[pond]]s to various land-surrounded [[mediterranean sea]]s&lt;ref
 name="dicdef-1"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mediterranean definition of mediterranean sea]; "6. surrounded or nearly surrounded by land."&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Black Sea]], were particularly prevalent in the [[Cretaceous]] Atlantic but also characterized other parts of the world ocean. In an ice-free sea of these supposed super-greenhouse worlds, oceanic waters were as much as 200 meters higher, in some eras. During the time spans in question, the [[continental plate]]s are believed to have been well separated, and the [[mountain]]s we know today were (mostly) future [[tectonic]] events—meaning the overall landscapes were generally much lower— and even the half super-greenhouse climates would have been eras of highly expedited water erosion&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt;  carrying massive amounts of nutrients into the world oceans fueling an overall explosive population of microorganisms and their predator species in the oxygenated upper layers.

Detailed stratigraphic studies of Cretaceous black shales from many parts of the world have indicated that two oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) were particularly significant in terms of their impact on the chemistry of the oceans, one in the early [[Aptian]] (~120 Ma), sometimes called the [[Selli Event]] (or OAE 1a) &lt;ref name="oaedef"&gt;{{cite journal

* Insofar as the Cretaceous OAEs can be represented by type localities, it is the striking outcrops of laminated black shales within the vari-colored claystones and pink and white limestones near the town of Gubbio in the Italian [[Apennines]] that are the best candidates.
* The 1-meter thick black shale at the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary that crops out near Gubbio is termed the ‘Livello Bonarelli’ after the man who first described it in 1891.

More minor oceanic anoxic events have been proposed for other intervals in the Cretaceous (in the [[Valanginian]], [[Hauterivian]], [[Albian]] and [[Coniacian]]–[[Santonian]] stages), but their sedimentary record, as represented by organic-rich black shales, appears more parochial, being dominantly represented in the Atlantic and neighboring areas, and some researchers relate them to particular local conditions rather than being forced by global change.

===Jurassic===
{{Main|Jurassic}}
The only oceanic anoxic event documented from the Jurassic took place during the early [[Toarcian]] (~183 Ma).&lt;ref name="Gronstal 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 2008"/&gt; Because no DSDP ([[Deep Sea Drilling Project]]) or ODP ([[Ocean Drilling Program]]) cores have recovered black shales of this age – there being little or no Toarcian ocean crust remaining in the world ocean – the samples of black shale primarily come from outcrops on land.  These outcrops, together with material from some commercial oil wells, are found on all major continents and this event seems similar in kind to the two major Cretaceous examples.

===Paleozoic===
{{Main|Paleozoic}}
The boundary between the Ordovician and Silurian periods is marked by repetitive periods of anoxia, interspersed with normal, oxic conditions. In addition, anoxic periods are found during the Silurian.  These anoxic periods occurred at a time of low global temperatures (although {{co2}} levels were high), in the midst of a glaciation.&lt;ref name=Page2007&gt;{{palAss2007|author=Page, A. |author2=Zalasiewicz, J. |author3=Williams, M |last-author-amp=yes |title=Deglacial anoxia in a long-lived Early Palaeozoic Icehouse. |pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeppsson (1990) proposes a mechanism whereby the temperature of polar waters determines the site of formation of downwelling water.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the high latitude waters are below {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, they will be dense enough to sink; as they are cool, oxygen is highly soluble in their waters, and the deep ocean will be oxygenated.  If high latitude waters are warmer than {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, their density is too low for them to sink below the cooler deep waters.  Therefore, thermohaline circulation can only be driven by salt-increased density, which tends to form in warm waters where evaporation is high.  This warm water can dissolve less oxygen, and is produced in smaller quantities, producing a sluggish circulation with little deep water oxygen.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990/&gt;  The effect of this warm water propagates through the ocean, and reduces the amount of {{co2}} that the oceans can hold in solution, which makes the oceans release large quantities of {{co2}} into the atmosphere in a geologically short time (tens or thousands of years).&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;  The warm waters also initiate the [[Clathrate gun hypothesis|release of clathrates]], which further increases atmospheric temperature and basin anoxia.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;  Similar positive feedbacks operate during cold-pole episodes, amplifying their cooling effects.

The periods with cold poles are termed "P-episodes" (short for ''primo''&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and are characterised by [[Bioturbation|bioturbated]] deep oceans, a humid equator and higher weathering rates, and terminated by extinction events - for example, the [[Ireviken event|Ireviken]] and [[Lau event]]s.  The inverse is true for the warmer, oxic "S-episodes" (''secundo''), where deep ocean sediments are typically [[graptolit]]ic black shales.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990/&gt;
A typical cycle of ''secundo-primo'' episodes and ensuing ''event'' typically lasts around 3&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

The duration of events is so long compared to their onset because the positive feedbacks must be overwhelmed.  Carbon content in the ocean-atmosphere system is affected by changes in weathering rates, which in turn is dominantly controlled by rainfall. Because this is inversely related to temperature in Silurian times, carbon is gradually drawn down during warm (high {{co2}}) S-episodes, while the reverse is true during P-episodes.  On top of this gradual trend is overprinted the signal of [[Milankovic cycles]], which ultimately trigger the switch between P- and S- episodes.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

These events become longer during the Devonian; the enlarging land plant biota probably acted as a large buffer to carbon dioxide concentrations.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

The end-Ordovician Hirnantian event may alternatively be a result of algal blooms, caused by sudden supply of nutrients through wind-driven upwelling or an influx of nutrient-rich meltwater from melting glaciers, which by virtue of its fresh nature would also slow down oceanic circulation.&lt;ref name="Lüning2006"&gt;{{cite journal

===Archean and Proterozoic===
It has been thought that through most of Earth's history, oceans were largely oxygen-deficient. During the [[Archean]], euxinia was largely absent because of low availability of [[sulfate]] in the oceans,&lt;ref name="Kump 2008"/&gt; but during the Proterozoic, it would become more common.

'''Bagan''' ({{MYname|MY=ပုဂံ|MLCTS=pu.gam}}, {{IPA-my|bəɡàɴ|IPA}}; formerly '''Pagan''') is an ancient city located in the [[Mandalay Region]] of [[Myanmar]]. From the 9th to 13th centuries, the city was the capital of the [[Pagan Kingdom]], the first kingdom that unified the regions that would later constitute modern Myanmar. During the kingdom's height between the 11th and 13th centuries, over 10,000 [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples, [[pagoda]]s and monasteries were constructed in the Bagan plains alone, of which the remains of over 2,200 temples and pagodas still survive to the present day.

The '''Bagan Archaeological Zone''' is a main attraction for [[Tourism in Burma|the country's nascent tourism industry]]. It is seen by many as equal in attraction to [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21578171-why-investors-still-need-proceed-caution-promiseand-pitfalls |title=Business: The promise—and the pitfalls |website=The Economist |date=25 May 2013 |access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Bagan is the present-day [[Burmese dialects#Standard dialects|standard Burmese pronunciation]] of the Burmese word ''Pugan'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|ပုဂံ}}), derived from [[Old Burmese]] ''Pukam'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|ပုကမ်}}). Its classical [[Pali]] name is ''[[Arimaddana|Arimaddanapura]]'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|အရိမဒ္ဒနာပူရ}}, lit. "the City that Tramples on Enemies"). Its other names in Pali are in reference to its extreme dry zone climate: ''Tattadesa'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|တတ္တဒေသ}}, "parched land"), and ''Tampadīpa'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|တမ္ပဒီပ}}, "bronzed country").&lt;ref name="tt-117-118"&gt;Than Tun 1964: 117–118&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Burmese chronicles]] also report other classical names of ''[[Thiri Pyissaya]]'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|သီရိပစ္စယာ}}; {{lang-pi|Siripaccaya}}) and ''[[Tampawaddy]]'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|တမ္ပဝတီ}}; {{lang-pi|Tampavatī}}).&lt;ref name="my-1-139-141"&gt;Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 139–141&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===9th to 13th centuries===
{{Main article|Early Pagan Kingdom|Pagan Kingdom}}
[[File:Bagan Sunset.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bagan's prosperous economy built over 10,000 temples between the 11th and 13th centuries.]]
[[File:Pagan Empire -- Sithu II.PNG|thumb|150px|Pagan Empire c. 1210]]

According to the [[Burmese chronicles]], Bagan was founded in the second century [[Anno Domini|AD]], and fortified in 849 AD by King [[Pyinbya]], 34th successor of the founder of early Bagan.&lt;ref name="geh-18"&gt;Harvey 1925: 18&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream scholarship however holds that Bagan was founded in the mid-to-late 9th century by the [[Bamar|Mranma]] (Burmans), who had recently entered the Irrawaddy valley from the [[Nanzhao Kingdom]]. It was among several competing [[Pyu city-states]] until the late 10th century when the Burman settlement grew in authority and grandeur.&lt;ref name="vbl-90-91"&gt;Lieberman 2003: 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1044 to 1287, Bagan was the capital as well as the political, economic and cultural nerve center of the [[Pagan Empire]]. Over the course of 250 years, Bagan's rulers and their wealthy subjects constructed over 10,000 religious monuments (approximately 1000 stupas, 10,000 small temples and 3000 monasteries)&lt;ref name="dms-216"&gt;Stadtner 2011: 216&lt;/ref&gt; in an area of {{convert|104|km2|sqmi}} in the Bagan plains. The prosperous city grew in size and grandeur, and became a cosmopolitan center for religious and secular studies, specializing in Pali scholarship in grammar and philosophical-psychological (''[[abhidhamma]]'') studies as well as works in a variety of languages on [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], [[phonology]], grammar, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], medicine, and legal studies.&lt;ref name="vbl-115-116"&gt;Lieberman 2003: 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; The city attracted monks and students from as far as [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[Khmer Empire]].

The culture of Bagan was dominated by religion. The religion of Bagan was fluid, syncretic and by later standards, unorthodox. It was largely a continuation of religious trends in the [[Pyu city-states|Pyu era]] where [[Theravada Buddhism]] co-existed with [[Mahayana Buddhism]], [[Tantric Buddhism]], various Hindu ([[Shaivism|Saivite]], and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishana]]) schools as well as native animist (''[[nat (spirit)|nat]]'') traditions. While the royal patronage of Theravada Buddhism since the mid-11th century had enabled the Buddhist school to gradually gain primacy, other traditions continued to thrive throughout the Pagan period to degrees later unseen.&lt;ref name="vbl-115-116"/&gt;

The Pagan Empire collapsed in 1287 due to repeated [[First Mongol invasion of Burma|Mongol invasions]] (1277–1301). Recent research shows that Mongol armies may not have reached Bagan itself, and that even if they did, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal.&lt;ref name="vbl-119-120"&gt;[[Victor Lieberman|Lieberman]] 2003: 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; However, the damage had already been done. The city, once home to some 50,000 to 200,000 people, had been reduced to a small town, never to regain its preeminence. The city formally ceased to be the capital of Burma in December 1297 when the [[Myinsaing Kingdom]] became the new power in Upper Burma.&lt;ref name="mha-74"&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tt-1959-119-120"&gt;Than Tun 1959: 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

===14th to 19th centuries===
[[File:Hot air balloon over a pagoda in Bagan.jpg|thumb|A hot-air balloon flying over a pagoda in Bagan]]
Bagan survived into the 15th century as a human settlement,&lt;ref name="mat-1985-196-197"&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 196–197&lt;/ref&gt; and as a pilgrimage destination throughout the imperial period. A smaller number of "new and impressive" religious monuments still went up to the mid-15th century but afterward, new temple constructions slowed to a trickle with fewer than 200 temples built between the 15th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="dms-216"/&gt; The old capital remained a pilgrimage destination but pilgrimage was focused only on "a score or so" most prominent temples out of the thousands such as the [[Ananda Temple|Ananda]], the [[Shwezigon Pagoda|Shwezigon]], the [[Sulamani Temple|Sulamani]], the [[Htilominlo Temple|Htilominlo]], the [[Dhammayazika Pagoda|Dhammayazika]], and a few other temples along an ancient road. The rest—thousands of less famous, out-of-the-way temples—fell into disrepair, and most did not survive the test of time.&lt;ref name="dms-216"/&gt;

For the few dozen temples that were regularly patronized, the continued patronage meant regular upkeep as well as architectural additions donated by the devotees. Many temples were repainted with new frescoes on top of their original Pagan era ones, or fitted with new Buddha statutes. Then came a series of state-sponsored "systematic" renovations in the [[Konbaung dynasty|Konbaung period]] (1752–1885), which by and large were not true to the original designs—some finished with "a rude plastered surface, scratched without taste, art or result". The interiors of some temples were also whitewashed, such as the [[Thatbyinnyu Temple|Thatbyinnyu]] and the Ananda. Many painted inscriptions and even murals were added in this period.&lt;ref name="dms-217"&gt;Stadtner 2011: 217&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century to present===
[[File:Pumpkin Pagoda -Bupaya Pagoda-, Pagan, Upper Burma.jpg|thumb|The original Bupaya seen here in 1868 was completely destroyed by the 1975 earthquake. A new pagoda in the original shape, but gilded, has been rebuilt.]]

Bagan, located in an active earthquake zone, had suffered from many earthquakes over the ages, with over 400 recorded earthquakes between 1904 and 1975.&lt;ref name="uc-28-ix"&gt;Unesco 1976: ix&lt;/ref&gt; A [[1975 Bagan earthquake|major earthquake]] occurred on 8 July 1975, reaching 8 [[Mercalli intensity scale|MM]] in Bagan and [[Myinkaba]], and 7 MM in [[Nyaung-U]].&lt;ref name="iy-ky"&gt;Ishizawa and Kono 1989: 114&lt;/ref&gt; The quake damaged many temples, in many cases, such as the [[Bupaya Pagoda|Bupaya]], severely and irreparably. Today, 2229 temples and pagodas remain.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-117"&gt;Köllner, Bruns 1998: 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these damaged pagodas underwent restorations in the 1990s by the [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]], which sought to make Bagan an international tourist destination. However, the restoration efforts instead drew widespread condemnation from art historians and preservationists worldwide. Critics are aghast that the restorations paid little attention to original architectural styles, and used modern materials, and that the government has also established a [[golf course]], a paved highway, and built a 61-meter (200-foot) watchtower. Although the government believed that the ancient capital's hundreds of (unrestored) temples and large corpus of stone inscriptions were more than sufficient to win the designation of UNESCO World Heritage Site,&lt;ref name="unesco-whs"&gt;Unesco 1996&lt;/ref&gt; the city has not been so designated, allegedly mainly on account of the restorations.&lt;ref name=jbt&gt;Tourtellot 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagan today is a main tourist destination in the country's nascent tourism industry, which has long been the target of various boycott campaigns. The majority of over 300,000 international tourists to the country in 2011 are believed to have also visited Bagan.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Several Burmese publications note that the city's small tourism infrastructure will have to expand rapidly even to meet a modest pickup in tourism in the following years.

On 24 August 2016, a [[August 2016 Myanmar earthquake|major earthquake]] hit central Burma and again did major damage in Bagan; this time almost 400 temples were destroyed. The Sulamani and Myauk Guni (North Guni) were severely damaged. The Bagan Archaeological Department has started a survey and reconstruction effort with the help of UNESCO experts. Visitors are prohibited from entering 33 damaged temples.

==Geography==
[[File:Bagan temples map.png|thumb|Map of the Bagan area showing the locations of the temples, hotels and transportation hubs]]
The '''Bagan Archaeological Zone''', defined as the 13 x 8&amp;nbsp;km area centred around Old Bagan, consisting of [[Nyaung U]] in the north and New Bagan in the south,&lt;ref name="unesco-whs"/&gt; lies in the vast expanse of plains in Upper Burma on the bend of the [[Irrawaddy river]]. It is located {{convert|290|km|mi}} south-west of [[Mandalay]] and {{convert|700|km|mi}} north of [[Yangon]]. Its coordinates are 21°10' North and 94°52' East.

===Climate===
Bagan lies in the middle of the "dry zone" of Burma, the region roughly between [[Shwebo]] in the north and [[Pyay]] in the south. Unlike the coastal regions of the country, which receive annual monsoon rainfalls exceeding 2500 [[millimeter|mm]], the dry zone gets little precipitation as it is sheltered from the rain by the [[Rakhine Yoma]] mountain range in the west.

Available online climate sources report Bagan climate quite differently.

===Architecture===
Bagan stands out for not only the sheer number of religious edifices of Myanmar but also the magnificent architecture of the buildings, and their contribution to Burmese temple design. The artistry of the architecture of pagodas in Bagan proves the achievement of Myanmar craftsmen in handicrafts. The Bagan temple falls into one of two broad categories: the ''[[stupa]]''-style solid temple and the ''gu''-style ({{my|ဂူ}}) hollow temple.

====Stupas====
A ''stupa'', also called a pagoda, is a massive structure, typically with a relic chamber inside. The Bagan ''stupas'' or pagodas evolved from earlier Pyu designs, which in turn were based on the ''stupa'' designs of the Andhra region, particularly [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] and [[Nagarjunakonda]] in present-day south-eastern India, and to a smaller extent to [[Ceylon]].&lt;ref name="mat-2005-26-31"&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 26–31&lt;/ref&gt; The Bagan-era stupas in turn were the prototypes for later Burmese stupas in terms of symbolism, form and design, building techniques and even materials.&lt;ref name="mat-2005-233-235"&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 233–235&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

Originally, a Ceylonese ''stupa'' had a hemispheric body ({{lang-pi|anda}} "the egg"), on which a rectangular box surrounded by a stone [[balustrade]] (''harmika'') was set. Extending up from the top of the ''stupa'' was a shaft supporting several ceremonial umbrellas. The ''stupa'' is a representation of the [[Buddhist cosmology|Buddhist cosmos]]: its shape symbolizes [[Mount Meru]] while the umbrella mounted on the brickwork represents the world's axis.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-118-120"&gt;Köllner, Bruns 1998: 118–120&lt;/ref&gt; The brickwork pediment was often covered in stucco and decorated in relief. Pairs or series of ogres as guardian figures ('bilu') were a favourite theme in the Bagan period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Falconer, J.; Moore, E.; Tettoni, L. I. |title=Burmese design and architecture |year=2000 |publisher=Periplus |location=Hong Kong |isbn=9625938826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Indic design was gradually modified first by the [[Pyu people|Pyu]], and then by Burmans at Bagan where the ''stupa'' gradually developed a longer, cylindrical form. The earliest Bagan ''stupas'' such as the Bupaya (c. 9th century) were the direct descendants of the Pyu style at [[Sri Ksetra]]. By the 11th century, the ''stupa'' had developed into a more bell-shaped form in which the parasols morphed into a series of increasingly smaller rings placed on one top of the other, rising to a point. On top the rings, the new design replaced the ''harmika'' with a lotus bud. The lotus bud design then evolved into the "banana bud", which forms the extended apex of most Burmese pagodas. Three or four rectangular terraces served as the base for a pagoda, often with a gallery of terra-cotta tiles depicting Buddhist ''[[jataka]]'' stories. The [[Shwezigon Pagoda]] and the [[Shwesandaw Pagoda (Bagan)|Shwesandaw Pagoda]] are the earliest examples of this type.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-118-120"/&gt; Examples of the trend toward a more bell-shaped design gradually gained primacy as seen in the [[Dhammayazika Pagoda]] (late 12th century) and the [[Mingalazedi Pagoda]] (late 13th century).&lt;ref name="mat-2005-210-213"&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 210–213&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hollow temples====
{{double image|right|Gawdawpalin Temple Bagan Myanmar.jpg|131|Dhammayangyi Paya, Bagan, Myanmar.jpg|120|"One-face"-style [[Gawdawpalin Temple]] (left) and "four-face" [[Dhammayangyi Temple]]}}

In contrast to the ''stupas'', the hollow ''gu''-style temple is a structure used for meditation, devotional worship of the Buddha and other Buddhist rituals. The ''gu'' temples come in two basic styles: "one-face" design and "four-face" design—essentially one main entrance and four main entrances. Other styles such as five-face and hybrids also exist. The one-face style grew out of 2nd century [[Beikthano]], and the four-face out of 7th century Sri Ksetra. The temples, whose main features were the pointed arches and the vaulted chamber, became larger and grander in the Bagan period.&lt;ref name="mat-2005-224-225"&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 224–225&lt;/ref&gt;

====Innovations====
Although the Burmese temple designs evolved from Indic, Pyu (and possibly Mon) styles, the techniques of vaulting seem to have developed in Bagan itself. The earliest vaulted temples in Bagan date to the 11th century, while the vaulting did not become widespread in India until the late 12th century. The masonry of the buildings shows "an astonishing degree of perfection", where many of the immense structures survived the 1975 earthquake more or less intact.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-118-120"/&gt; (Unfortunately, the vaulting techniques of the Bagan era were lost in the later periods. Only much smaller ''gu'' style temples were built after Bagan. In the 18th century, for example, King [[Bodawpaya]] attempted to build the [[Mingun Pagoda]], in the form of spacious vaulted chambered temple but failed as craftsmen and masons of the later era had lost the knowledge of vaulting and keystone arching to reproduce the spacious interior space of the Bagan hollow temples.&lt;ref name="mat-2005-233-235"/&gt;)

Another architectural innovation originated in Bagan is the Buddhist temple with a pentagonal floor plan. This design grew out of hybrid (between one-face and four-face designs) designs. The idea was to include the veneration of the [[Maitreya Buddha]], the future and fifth Buddha of this era, in addition to the four who had already appeared. The Dhammayazika and the [[Ngamyethna Pagoda]] are examples of the pentagonal design.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-118-120"/&gt;

[[File:Nyaung U Airport.JPG|thumb|left|[[Nyaung U Airport]] is the gateway to the Bagan region]]

Bagan is accessible by air, rail, bus, car and river boat.

===Air===
Most international tourists fly to the city. The [[Nyaung U Airport]] is the gateway to the Bagan region. Several domestic airlines have regular flights to [[Yangon]], which take about 80 minutes to cover the 600 kilometres. Flights to [[Mandalay]] take approximately 30 minutes and to [[Heho]] about 40 minutes.&lt;ref name="bagantravel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-bagan.com/getting-there.html |title=Getting to Bagan Myanmar |website=Visit Bagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport is located on the outskirts of [[Nyaung U]] and it takes about 20 minutes by taxi to reach Bagan.

===Rail===
The city is on a spur from the Yangon-Mandalay rail line. [[Myanmar Railways]] operates a daily overnight train service each way between [[Yangon]] and Bagan (Train Nos 61 &amp; 62), which takes at least 18 hours. The trains have a sleeper car and also 1st Class and Ordinary Class seating.&lt;ref name="trainmyanmar"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.seat61.com/Burma.htm#Yangon-Bagan |title=Train Travel in Myanmar |website=The man in seat 61...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Between [[Mandalay]] and Bagan there are two daily services each way (Train Nos 117,118,119 &amp; 120) that take at least 8 hours. The trains have 1st Class and Ordinary Class seating.&lt;ref name="trainmyanmar" /&gt;

===Buses and cars===
Overnight buses and cars also operate to and from [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]] taking approximately 9 and 6 hours respectively.&lt;ref name="bagantravel" /&gt;

===Boat===
An 'express' ferry service runs between Bagan and [[Mandalay]]. Following the Irrawaddy river the fastest ferry takes around 9 hours to travel the 170 kilometres. The service runs daily during peak periods and slower sailings with overnight stops are also available.

==Economy==
[[File:Bagan-Lacquerware-Factory-Workers.JPG|thumb|Workers at a lacquerware factory]]

Bagan's economy is based mainly on [[tourism]]. Because of boycotts against the previous military government, the Bagan region's tourism infrastructure is still quite modest by international standards. The city has a few international standard hotels and many family-run guesthouses. Bagan is also the center of Burmese [[lacquerware]] industry, which to a large degree depends on tourist demand. Much of the lacquerware is destined for souvenir shops in Yangon, and to the world markets. Moreover, the lacquerware-making process itself has become a tourist draw.

==Demographics==
The population of Bagan in its heyday is estimated anywhere between 50,000&lt;ref name="geh-78"&gt;Harvey 1925: 78&lt;/ref&gt; to 200,000 people.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-115"&gt;Köllner, Bruns 1998: 115&lt;/ref&gt; Until the advent of tourism industry in the 1990s, only a few villagers lived in Old Bagan. The rise of tourism has attracted a sizable population to the area. Because Old Bagan is now off limits to permanent dwellings, much of the population reside in either New Bagan, south of Old Bagan, or Nyaung-U, north of Old Bagan. The majority of native residents are [[Bamar people|Bamar]].

==Administration==
The Bagan archaeological zone is part of [[Nyaung-U District]], [[Mandalay Region]].

[[File:Bellacorick County Mayo Summer 2010.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Bellacorick blanket bog June 2010]]

'''Bellacorick''' or '''Bellacoric''' ({{irish place name|Béal Átha Chomhraic|ford mouth of the confluence}}) is a [[townland]] in [[County Mayo]], Ireland. It comprises an area of {{convert|800|acre|km2}}. The area is remote, virtually uninhabited [[blanket bog]] which was once used mainly for milled peat production. Nowadays, it is a [[Special Area of Conservation]] because of the unique nature of the intact blanket bog habitat. The main [[Belmullet]] to [[Castlebar]] and [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]] road passes through this townland.

== History ==
There is virtually no [[arable land]] in this area of lowland blanket bog but in the 19th century the area was leased to a Patrick Burke who housed horses in stables opposite the public house which comprises virtually all of this [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]].  There was a shooting lodge which later became the post office, but this was later moved again to Kilsallagh and there is now no post office in Bellacorick.  There used to be a Garda Station close to the Bridge but it was abandoned around 1940 and the area was policed by Crossmolina.

=== The Musical Bridge ===

[[File:Musical bridge Bellacorick June 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Musical Bridge, Bellacorick]]In about 1820, the civil engineer, [[William Bald]], who was mapping the area and building roads through [[Erris]], designed the Bellacorick Bridge, known as the Musical Bridge, it can be 'played' in two different ways:
* The first way is by rolling a stone along the parapet on either side.  As the stone drops along musical notes are produced in rapid succession.
* The second method is to hold the stone in your hand and to strike it on the slabs which form the coping of the parapet hitting each slab as you go along and drawing back the hand immediately after striking.  Each slab gives forth its own peculiar note and a musical scale is produced.

The bridge was difficult to erect.  Because of the remarkable soundness of the earth the foundation had to be secured by timber.  It has four elliptical arches each thirty feet apart, with battlements nearly {{convert|400|ft|m}} long.  The Erris prophet [[Brian Rua U'Cearbhain]] referred to the then unbuilt bridge at Bellacorick in the 17th century.  He said that it would never be finished and it never has been.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inver.org/ceantar/des.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy generation ==

=== Peat-fired power station ===
[[Peat]] has been Ireland's staple fuel for centuries and still provides about 12% of the nation's energy needs.  In June 1949, James Kilroy TD, representing [[Erris]], requested the government to build a 'turf fired power station for the generation of electricity in Erris.  He also pointed out the advantage of reclaiming the bog and introducing a scheme of afforestation!.  The [[ESB Customer Supply|ESB]] acquired five and a half acres, two hundred metres from the bridge as the site for the [[power station]].  The access road was built over the ruins of the old shooting lodge.  At the same time [[Bord na Mona]] bought {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} of bogland.  They harvested the turf to feed the power station.  The peat was pulverised and dried in the summer.  It was stored on the bog in large polythene covered piles.  It was then taken to the station by railway wagons pulled by diesel locomotives.

==== Closure ====
In 2007 the massive chimney at Bellacorick was demolished for safety reasons.  Even those who would have been opposed to the fossil-fuel burning power station on [[Environmental policy|environmental]] and [[greenhouse gas]] grounds were sad to see the chimney demolished as it had become a well-known landmark for those returning home to [[Erris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crossmolina.ie/The-News/Local-News/Bellacorrick-peat%11burning-tower-torn-down-20071014958/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609211127/http://www.crossmolina.ie/The-News/Local-News/Bellacorrick-peat%11burning-tower-torn-down-20071014958/ |archivedate=9 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unfortunately, although the visually attractive chimney has been removed, the visually offensive [[Abandoned property|derelict]] sixties-style block buildings, several storeys in height, are still standing, ungraciously draped with green netting, as a blot on the landscape.  As a result, it is difficult to get a decent view of the white windmills of the [[windfarm]] at the site.

=== Wind farm ===
Since 1992 Ireland's first commercial [[wind farm]] has been operating at Bellacorick.  The wind farm comprised 21 [[wind turbines]] with a total installed capacity of 6.45 [[megawatt]]s and produces enough electricity to supply 4,500 households.

The North Mayo area had long been identified as perhaps the best wind farm site in the country.  All the key criteria for a successful wind farm project were satisfied at Bellacorick.  The mean annual [[wind speed]] at the site at a height of 30 metres is 7.28&amp;nbsp;m/s.  The prevailing wind direction is south-westerly and the wind blows from the south west 50% of the time.  The wind regime is strong, steady winds.  The ground is flat with an open aspect to the prevailing winds, resulting in virtually no loss or [[turbulence]] due to [[topographical]] features. The nearby [[thermal]] [[power station]] is linked to the National Electricity Grid.  The Bellacorick [[wind farm]] is owned and operated by Renewable Energy Ireland whose major shareholder is [[Bord na Mona]].
The [[environment (systems)|environmental]] benefits of the wind farm can be stated in terms of [[Sustainability|environmental impacts]] avoided through not having to generate electricity from [[fossil fuel]] sources&amp;nbsp;– coal, [[peat]], oil and gas.  Bellacorick wind farm avoids the production of 120 tonnes of [[sulphur dioxide]], 85 tonnes of [[nitrous oxide]]s and 20,000 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] in a year.

On 16 February 2011, Capital Approval for the 400 kV Grid West Electricity Transmission Scheme (Grid West) was granted by the [[EirGrid]] Board. The project is driven by the need to connect 646.5 MW of Gate 3 wind generation at Bellacorick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eirgridprojects.com/media/Grid25%20issue%203%20April%202010.pdf Grid25 -3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523080753/http://www.eirgridprojects.com/media/Grid25%20issue%203%20April%202010.pdf |date=23 May 2013 }} ''[[EirGrid]]''. March/April 2011. Accessed: 22 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2016}}, the project is awaiting consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eirgridgroup.com/the-grid/projects/grid-west/whats-happening-now/ |title=What's Happening Now?|publisher=[[EirGrid]] |accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport ==
Bus Éireann route 446 links Bellacorick with [[Crossmolina]] and [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]]. In the reverse direction it links to [[Bangor Erris]], [[Belmullet]] and locations on the [[Mullet Peninsula]]. There is one service a day in each direction, including Sundays. On Friday evenings an extra journey operates from Ballina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buseireann.ie/pdf/1279700047-446.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517022954/http://www.buseireann.ie/pdf/1279700047-446.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Onward rail and bus connections are available at Ballina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63072">{{use mdy dates|date=November 2016}}'''Communication accommodation theory''' ('''CAT''') is a theory of [[communication]] developed by [[Howard Giles]]. This theory concerns "(1) the behavioral changes that people make to attune their communication to their partner, and (2) the extent to which people perceive their partner as appropriately attuning to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bates|first1=James|last2=Taylor|first2=Alan|title=Grandparent–Grandchild Relationships|journal=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Family Studies|date=2016|url=http://search.credoreference.com.db19.linccweb.org/content/entry/wileyfamily/grandparent_grandchild_relationships/0?institutionId=6086|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is concerned with the links between language, context, and identity.{{sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005}} It focuses on both the intergroup and interpersonal factors that lead to accommodation, as well as the ways that power, macro and micro-context concerns affect communication behaviors.{{sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005}}

"Communication accommodation theorists focus on the patterns of convergence and divergence of communication behaviors, particularly as they relate to people’s goals for social approval, communication efficiency, and identity".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallois|first1=Cindy|last2=Giles|first2=Howard|title=Communication Accommodation Theory|journal=The International Encyclopedia of Language and Social Interaction|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Convergence" refers to strategies through which individuals adapt to each other's communicative behaviors to reduce these social differences.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} Meanwhile, "divergence" refers to the instances in which individuals accentuate the speech and non-verbal differences between themselves and their interlocutors.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} Sometimes when individuals try to engage in convergence they can also end up over-accommodating, and despite their good intentions their convergence can be seen as condescending.{{TOC limit|3}}

== Background ==

=== Speech accommodation theory ===

The communication accommodation theory was developed by [[Howard Giles]], professor of Communication at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].{{sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005}} The speech accommodation theory was developed to demonstrate all of the value of social psychological concepts to understanding the dynamics of speech.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} It sought to explain "... the motivations underlying certain shifts in people's speech styles during social encounters and some of the social consequences arising from them."{{sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005}}Particularly, it focused on the cognitive and affective processes underlying individuals' convergence and divergence through speech. The communication accommodation theory has broadened this theory to include not only speech but also the "non-verbal and discursive dimensions of social interaction".{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} CAT has also created a different perspective from other research in language and social interaction—and communication more generally—that focuses on either interpersonal or intergroup communication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Social psychology and social identity theory ===

Like speech accommodation theory, communication accommodation theory continues to draw from [[social psychology]], particularly from four main socio-psychology theories: similarity-attraction, [[social exchange]], causal attribution and intergroup distinctiveness. These theories help to explain why speakers seek to converge or diverge from the language, dialect, accent and behavior of their interlocutors. CAT also relies heavily in [[social identity theory]]. This latter theory argues that a person's self-concept comprises a personal identity and a [[social identity]], and that this social identity is based in comparisons people make between in-groups (groups they belong to) and out-groups (groups they do not belong to).{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} According to social identity theory, people strive to maintain a positive social identity by either joining groups where they feel more comfortable or making a more positive experience of belonging to the groups they already belong to. Since speech is a way to express group membership, people adopt convergence or divergence in communication to "signal a salient group distinctiveness, so as to reinforce a social identity".{{sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005}} Communication accommodation thus, becomes a tool to emphasize group distinctiveness in a positive way, and strengthen the individual's social identity. There are four main socio-psychological theories:

====Similarity-attraction====
The similarity-attraction theory posits that "The more similar our attitudes and beliefs are to those of others, the more likely it is for them to be attracted to us."{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Convergence through verbal and non-verbal communication is one of the mechanisms that we can use to become more similar to others, increasing their attraction towards us.{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} For this reason, it can be said that one of the factors that leads individuals to use convergence is a desire to obtain social approval from their interlocutor.{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} It could hence be concluded that "the greater one's need for social approval, the greater will be one's tendency to converge".{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Natalé (1975), for instance, has found that speakers with high needs for approval converge more to another's vocal intensity and pause length than those with low needs for approval.{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} An individual on the receiving end of high level of accommodation is likely to develop a greater sense of self-esteem and satisfaction than being a receiver of low accommodation.

====Social exchange process====
The social exchange process theory "... states that prior to acting, we attempt to assess the rewards and costs of alternate courses of action",{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} and that we tend to choose whatever course of action will bring greater rewards and less costs. The Social Exchange Theory is a theory that looks at how people evaluate their relationships. Throughout the process of evaluating relationships, individuals want to feel as if they are receiving more from the relationship than they are expending within the relationship. In other words, people like to be in relationships where the rewards outweigh the costs. Although most often convergence can bring forth rewards, there are some occasions when it can also bring forth costs such as "increased effort to converge, a loss of perceived integrity and personal (and sometimes group) identity".{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Hence, when choosing whether or not to use convergence, people assess these costs and rewards.{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}}

====Causal attribution process====
The causal attribution theory "[s]uggests that we interpret other people's behavior, and evaluate the individual themselves, in terms of the motivations and intentions that we attribute as the cause of their behavior"{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} It applies to convergence in that convergence might be viewed positively or negatively depending on the causes we attribute to it: "Although interpersonal convergence is generally favorably received, and non-convergence generally unfavorably received, the extent to which this holds true will undoubtedly be influenced by the listeners attributions of the speaker's intent."{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Giles and Smith provide the example of an experiment that they conducted amongst French and English speaking Canadians to illustrate this. In this experiment, when individuals believed that the person from the different group used language convergence to reduce cultural barriers, they evaluated it more positively than when they attributed it to the pressures of the situation. "When French Canadian listeners attributed an English Canadian's convergence to French as due to his desire to break down cultural barriers, the shift was viewed favorably. However, when this same behavior was attributed to pressures in the situation forcing the other to converge, positive feelings were not so strongly evoked."{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}}

====Intergroup distinctiveness====
The process of intergroup distinctiveness, as theorized by Tajfel argues, "... when members of different groups are in contact, they compare themselves on dimensions that are important to them, such as personal attributes, abilities, material possessions and so forth."{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} In these "intergroup social comparisons" individuals seek to find ways to make themselves positively distinct from the out-group to enhance their social identity.{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Because speech style and language is an important factor in defining social groups, divergence in speech style or language is often used to maintain intergroup distinctiveness and differentiate from the out-group, especially when group membership is a salient issue or the individual's identity and group membership is being threatened.{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}}

== Assumptions ==
Many of the principles and concepts from [[social identity theory]] are also applicable to communication accommodation theory. Under the influence of social psychology, especially social identity theory, communication accommodation theory are guided by mainly four assumptions.

*There are speech and behavioral similarities and dissimilarities in all conversations.
*The way we perceive the speech and behaviors of another determines our evaluation of the conversation.
*Language and behaviors have the ability to communicate social status and group belonging between people in a conversation.
*Norms guide the accommodation process, which varies in its degree of appropriateness.{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}}

The first assumption indicates that people bring their past experience to conversations. Therefore, communication is influenced by situational conditions and initial reactions but also the "social-historical context in which the interaction is embedded".{{sfn|Giles|Ogay|2007}} People's attitudes and beliefs, derived from those factors, determine the extent to which they are willing to accommodate in a conversation. The more similarities that they share with each other, the more likely for them to accommodate.

The second assumption is concerned with how people perceive and evaluate a conversation. Perception is '"the process of attending to and interpreting a message'"{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}}, and evaluation is the "process of judging a conversation".{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} Someone who enters a conversation usually first observes what takes place and then decides whether he should adjust to fit in. However, the decision about accommodation is not always necessary. If two strangers meet, they may have a random small talk and simply say goodbye. Then, neither of them is likely to evaluate the conversation since they have little chance of meeting again.

The importance of language and behavior is illustrated in the third assumption since they are indicators of social status and group belongings. When two people who speak different languages try to have a conversation, the language used is more likely to be the one used by the higher status person. That idea of "salient social membership"{{sfn|Giles|Ogay|2007}} negotiation is illustrated well during an interview as the interviewee usually makes all efforts to identify with the interviewer by accommodating the way that is spoken and behaved to raise the chance of getting the job.

The last assumption puts emphasis on social appropriateness and norms. Here, norms are defined as " expectations of behaviors that individuals feel should or should not occur in a conversation".{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} Those expectations give guidance to people's behaviors, helping them to figure out the appropriate way to accommodate. Most of the time, the accommodation made according to those norms are perceived socially appropriate. For instance, when a young person talks to the seniors in the family, he should avoid using jargons among his generation to show respect and to communicate more smoothly.

== Convergence and divergence ==

=== Convergence ===

Convergence refers to the process through which an individual shifts speech patterns in interaction so that they more closely resemble the speech patterns of speech partners.{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} People can converge through many features of communication such as their use of language, their "pronunciation, pause and utterance lengths, vocal intensities, non verbal behaviors, and intimacy of self disclosures"(Giles and Smith, 1979, 46), but they do not necessarily have to converge simultaneously at all of these levels. In fact, people can both converge at some levels and diverge through others at the same time.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} People use convergence based on their perceptions of others, as well as what they are able to infer about them and their backgrounds. Attraction (likability, charisma, credibility), also triggers convergence. As Turner and West note, "When communicators are attracted to others they will converge in their conversations."{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} On the other hand, as the similarity attraction theory highlights, when people have similar beliefs, personality and behaviors they tend to be more attracted towards each other. To achieve a "desired social distance"(Pardo, 2016), people use language to converge more towards a conversational partner they are attracted to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pardo|first=Jennifer S.|last2=Gibbons|first2=Rachel|last3=Suppes|first3=Alexandra|last4=Krauss|first4=Robert M.|date=2012-01-01|title=Phonetic convergence in college roommates|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095447011000945|journal=Journal of Phonetics|volume=40|issue=1|pages=190–197|doi=10.1016/j.wocn.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to make social interaction flow subsequently results in convergence. Many people tend to use converge with one another because they want to feel a sense of fitting in and experience social approval to the people around them. Thus, when one individual shifts speech and non-verbal behaviors in order to assimilate to the other it can result in a more favorable appraisal of him, that is: when convergence is perceived positively it is likely to enhance both the conversation and the attraction between the listener and the speaker. For this reason it could be said that convergence reflects "an individual's desire for social approval"{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} from his interlocutor, and that the greater the individual's need for social approval, the more likely he or she is to converge. Besides attraction, other factors that "influence the intensity of this" need of approval and hence the level of convergence "include the probability of future interactions, the social status of the addressee, and interpersonal variability for need of social approval".{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} Other factors that determine whether and to what extent individuals converge in interaction are their relational history, social norms and power variables.{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} Because individuals are more likely to converge to the individual with the higher status it is likely that the speech in a conversation will reflect the speech of the individual with the higher status.{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} Converging also increases the effectiveness of communication, which in turn lowers uncertainty, interpersonal anxiety, and increases mutual understanding. This is another factor that motivates people to converge.

=== Divergence ===

Divergence is a linguistic strategy whereby a member of a speech community accentuates the linguistic differences between himself and his interlocutor.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} "Given that communication features are often core dimensions of what it is to be a member of a group, divergence can be regarded as a very important tactic of displaying a valued distinctiveness from the other."{{sfn|Giles|Ogay|2007}} This helps to sustain a positive image of one's in-group and hence to strengthen one's social identity. Divergence is commonly used to establish dominance or power in an interaction. For example, if a recent college graduate becomes a professor, they might be teaching students who are around the same age as them. Therefore, it is important for the professor to communicate in a way that the students are aware the professor has more authority than them. Another case where there is a need for divergence are when professionals are with clients. In a 2001 study, doctors and patients discussed musculoskeletal disorders and it was observed that there were miscommunications that occurred because the participants chose to converge during the communication rather than to accentuate their position differences. Patients in the study felt more comfortable discussing their problems because they felt "positive about their doctor’s capacity to understand them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Susan C.|last2=Gallois|first2=Cindy|last3=Driedger|first3=S. Michelle|last4=Santesso|first4=Nancy|title=Communication Accommodation and Managing Musculoskeletal Disorders: Doctors' and Patients' Perspectives|journal=Health Communication|date=June 2011|volume=26|issue=4|pages=379–388|doi=10.1080/10410236.2010.551583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communicating in a fashion to make speech different can also be interpreted as a sign of dislike towards a person or group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example, "when you run into a disliked classmate from high school, your vocal pattern becomes more different from that classmate's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eadie|first1=William|title=Perspective Taking, Adaptation, and Coordination|journal=21st Century Communication: A Reference Handbook|date=2009|volume=1|pages=119–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents the act of divergence because you are purposely changing your speech to not sound like that person.

== Components ==
Further research conducted by Gallois et al. in 1995 has expanded the theory to include 17 propositions that influence these processes of convergence and divergence. They are categorized into four main components: the ''sociohistorical context'', ''the communicators' accommodative orientation'', the ''immediate situation'' and ''evaluation and future intentions''.{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}} These components are essential to Communication accommodation Theory and affect the course and outcome of intercultural conversations.

===Sociohistorical context===

The sociohistorical context refers to ways that past interactions between groups the communicators belong to influence the communication behaviors of the communicators. It includes "the relations between the groups having contact and the social norms regarding contact".{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}} These relations between the different groups the communicators belong to influence the communicators' behavior. Socio-historical factors that influence communicators include political or historical relations between nations, and different religious or ideological views of the two groups participating in the conversation.

===Accommodative orientation===

Accommodative orientation refers to the communicator's "... tendencies to perceive encounters with out group members in interpersonal terms, intergroup terms, or a combination of the two".{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}} There are three factors that are crucial to accommodative orientations: (1) "intrapersonal factors" (e.g. personality of the speakers), (2) "intergroup factors" (e.g. communicators' feelings toward outgroups), and (3) "initial orientations" (e.g., perceived potential for conflict).{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}} Issues that influence this last factor include: collectivistic culture context or whether the culture is collectivistic or individualistic; distressing history of interaction, the possible tensions that exist between groups due to past interactions; stereotypes; norms for treatment of groups; and high group solidarity/ high group dependence, how dependent the person's self-worth is in the group.{{sfn|Griffin|2008|pp=387–399}}

===Immediate situation===

The immediate situation refers to the moment when the actual communication takes place. It is shaped by five interrelated aspects: (1) ''sociopsychological states'', (2) ''goals and addressee focus'' (e.g., motivations and goals for the encounter), (3) ''sociolinguistic strategies'' (e.g., convergence or divergence), (4) ''behavior and tactics'' (e.g., topic, accent) and (5) ''labeling and attributions''.{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}}

===Evaluation and future intentions===

This aspect deals with how communicators perceive their conversational partners' behavior and its effects on future encounters between the two groups. Positively rated conversations will most likely lead to further communication between the interlocutors and other members of their respective groups.{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}}

==In action==

In 1991, Giles, Coupland, and Coupland expressed the belief that a "more qualitative perspective" would be necessary to get more diverse and clarifying explanations of the behaviors presented within varying contexts.  They referred to this as "the applied perspective" that showed accommodation theory as a vital part of day-to-day activity as opposed to solely being a theoretical construct. They sought to "demonstrate how the core concepts and relationships invoked by accommodation theory are available for addressing altogether pragmatic concerns".{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} For Giles, Coupland, and Coupland, these "pragmatic concerns" were extremely varied in nature.

One of these "pragmatic concerns" included understanding the relational issues that present themselves in the medical and clinical fields, such as the relational "alternatives, development, difficulties, and outcomes" that affected the patients' contentment with their medical interactions—and whether or not, through these interactions, they agreed with and implemented said health care regimens. Another of these situations involved the potential options in a legal arena. The way that the judges, plaintiffs, and defendants accommodated themselves to both the situation and the jury could manipulate the jury's acceptance or rejection of the defendant, and could, thus, control the outcome of the case.

Communication accommodation theory was also found to have a place in media. In regards to radio broadcasting, the alliance of the audience with the broadcaster played an important part in both the ratings that the shows would receive and whether the show progressed or was cancelled.

In the area of jobs and employment, accommodation theory was believed to influence the satisfaction one has with his or her job and the productivity that that person possesses in said job through convergence with or divergence from the co-workers and their work environment.

Accommodation theory also possessed practical applications in the development of learning a second language. This was seen when the student's education of and proficiency in said language was either assisted or hindered by accommodative measures. Giles, Coupland, and Coupland (1991) also addressed the part that accommodation theory plays in a situation they called ''language switching'', when bilingual individuals must decide which language they should speak when they are in an organizational environment with other bilingual individuals. This can be an incredibly important choice to make, especially in a business setting, because an incorrect judgment in this area of communication could unwittingly promote negative reactions between the two or more parties involved. In addition, accommodation theory was strongly intertwined with the way an immigrant accepts and is accepted by their host country. An instance of over-accommodation from the immigrating individual can unintentionally damage that person's sense of individuality while a strong divergence from the immigrating individual from their host culture can prompt the natives of the host country to react negatively to them because of the immigrating individual's use of divergence.

The final area of practical application, as presented by Giles, Coupland, and Coupland (1991), was that of accommodation theory's effect on the lives of people with disabilities. Accommodation theory was thought to either aid them by promoting them to "fulfill their communicative and life potentials", or by hindering them from reaching their full potential by focusing on the disability that made them different rather than the other characteristics that made them similar to their peers.

Despite the fact that communication accommodation theory is theoretical, it has shown itself to be viable by its numerous practical applications.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}}

== Criticisms ==

The Communication Accommodation Theory has obtained scholarly criticism by the three scholars Judee Burgon, Leesa Dillman, and Lesa Stern. These scholars question the "convergence-divergence frame... [and] they believe that conversations are too complex to be reduced simply to the processes of the Communication Accommodation theory. They also challenge the notion that people's accommodation can be explained by just the practice of [convergence-divergence]".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}} Questions asked by the scholars were: "what occurs if people both converge and diverge in conversations, are there consequences to the speaker, the listener, is there an influence if race or ethnicity is played in the process?".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}} It causes conflicts between communicators because the theory relies too heavily on a rational way of communicating. Sometimes we as people do not have a rational way of thinking and this becomes a problem when communicating.

== Application ==

The Communication Accommodation theory focuses "on the role of conversations in our lives".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}}  It has been incorporated into "the mass media (Bell, 1991), with families (Fox, 1999), with Chinese students (Hornsey and Gallois, 1998), with elderly (Harwood, 2002), on the job (McCroskey and Richmond, 2000), in interviews (Willemyns, Gallois, Callan, and Pittam, 1997), and even with messages left on telephone answering machines (Buzzanell, Burrell, Stafford, and Berkowitz, 1996)".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}} The theory tends to be heuristic because it is "expansive enough to be complete, and has been supported by research from diverse authors". "The theory's core processes of convergence and divergence make it relatively easy to understand, underscoring the simplicity of the theory".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}}

==Intergenerational communications==

Researchers of communication accommodation theory who have been interested in conversations between the elderly and the young, actively apply this theory to analyze intergenerational communication situations. Since the aging of population is becoming a serious issue in current society, communication difficulties of older adults and issues like [[ageism]] should be addressed. According to mainstream sociolinguistic studies, age is regarded as a variable only to the extent that it may show patterns of dialectal variation within speech communities across time. However, the existence of potentially important generational differences relating to beliefs about talk, situational perceptions, interactional goals, and various language devices between the young and the elderly are all taken into account as empirical questions in their own right{{sfn|Coupland|Coupland|Giles|Henwood|1988}} when using communication accommodation theory to explore intergenerational communication problems and improve effectiveness. Previous researchers have also developed models such as the communication predicament model of ageing,{{sfn|Ryan|Giles|Bartolucci|Henwood|1986}} and the communication enhancement model of ageing,{{sfn|Ryan|Meredith|MacLean|Orange|1995}} to point out numerous consequences brought by both negative and positive attitudes towards aging.

===Young-to-elderly language strategies===

Even though young people are more likely to perceive the old by multiple stereotypes, the elderly are negatively evaluated in most situations,{{sfn|Hummert|1990}} resulting in a reduction of meaningful communication.To further illustrate this, Ryan ''et al''. devised a typology of four young-to-elderly language strategies{{sfn|Ryan|Giles|Bartolucci|Henwood|1986}} in his research concerning psycho linguistic and social psychological components of communication with the elderly, addressing a problem for the elderly that they are vulnerable to the social and psychological circumstances of isolation, neglect, and negative stereotyping. However, it is not appropriate to see problematic intergenerational talk as a one-sided affair since both the young and the old can be responsible for miscommunication and unsuitable accommodation.

The first of these is characterized as over-accommodation due to physical or sensory handicaps, which happens when speakers talk to handicapped recipients, usually those with hearing impairment, and adapt their speech beyond the optimal level. This is also known as "Elderspeak", a form of baby talk in which a person addresses the elderly in an overly simple and sometimes patronizing way.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The second strategy is labelled as dependency-related over-accommodation, which refers to overbearing, excessively directive and disciplinary speech to the elderly. "It was conjectured that this strategy is encoded as one of the means by which a younger person can control the relationship and induce the elderly individual to become dependent on the former".{{sfn|Coupland|Coupland|Giles|Henwood|1988}}

Age-related divergence is the third strategy. This tenet proposes that young speakers may seek to amplify the distinctiveness of their own social group by purposefully acting in ways that differ from their stereotype of old speakers.{{sfn|Coupland|Coupland|Giles|Henwood|1988}} Older speakers might be seen as in physical and mental decline; slowing down with age and unable to keep pace with the current social norms. These young speakers, attempting to differentiate themselves from this image, will talk faster, use fashionable colloquialism and slang, and express more "modern" ideas and values in their communication with seniors.

The fourth strategy is intergroup over-accommodation and it is considered one of the most pervasive of young-to-elderly language strategies.  The "simple perception of an addressee's social category membership being old – and, independently of a particular handicap (if any), considerations of dependency and in-group symbolization are sufficient to invoke negative physical, social, and psychological inferences for many younger people".{{sfn|Coupland|Coupland|Giles|Henwood|1988}}

===Communication between old and young people in various relationships===

Giles has studied the interaction of young and elderly persons in business settings using communication accommodation as a theoretical framework. Findings demonstrated that elderly persons tend to be less accommodating than their younger counterparts. Findings also demonstrated that, for example, in business settings, one is much more likely to accommodate and converge to the language of a superior, such as a manager, than to someone with less or equal amount of superiority, such as a co-worker.  While several other factors came into play, convergence, and divergence portions of this theory were used in interpreting and explain this phenomenon.{{sfn|McCann|Giles|2006}}

The prevalence of and consequences for ageism and ageist language in intergenerational interactions in health care contexts such as hospitals and long-term care facilities have also been discussed.{{sfn|Nussbaum|Pitts|Huber|Krieger|2005}} Factors such as negative ageist stereotypes and unique features of the older adult patient-physician interaction can result in miscommunication between physicians and patients.{{sfn|Nussbaum|Pecchioni|Crowell|2001}} Moreover, individuals are more likely to use patronizing language styles,{{sfn|Hummert|Shaner|Garstka|Henry|1998}} to evaluate patronizing communication positively, and less likely to respond assertively to ageist language in hospital settings than in community dwellings.{{sfn|Hummert|Mazloff|2001}} In the domain of mental health care for older individuals, research also suggests that the elderly are systematically disadvantaged when interacting with mental health professionals.{{sfn|Ivey|Wieling|Harris|2000}}

==Intercultural communications==

Since communication accommodation theory applies to both interpersonal and inter-group communication one of the fields in which it has been most applied has been in [[intercultural communication]]. Within this field it has been applied to explain and analyze communication behaviors in a variety of situations, such as interactions between non-native and natives during second language acquisition processes, and interactions between inter-ethnic groups.

Studies{{sfn|Dörnyei|Csizér|2005}} show the comparison of communication accommodation in foreign countries between tourists and locals. In countries with heavy tourism, many being [[Third World]], it is common that the actual tourists have little to no competency in, or desire of having competency in the language and style of communication of the local natives. On the other hand, the country's local economy as well as the livelihood of its citizens, heavily depends on these tourists. Therefore, there is a great need to accommodate the communication styles of the tourists.

==Communication between native and non-native language speakers in second language acquisition==

===Non-native language speakers===

The input that [[non-native speakers]] (NNS) obtain from their interlocutors during [[second language acquisition]] is crucial in their process of language learning.{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}  For instance, as the similarity attraction theory predicts, non-native speakers (NNS) are more likely to converge towards the [[native speaker]]'s (NS) language when they identify him or her as similar to themselves: "When an NNS and an NS share important social identities, ethnic or not, the NNS will be more likely to converge towards the NS's language use".{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}  In a study conducted by Young (1998) for instance, high [[Language proficiency|proficiency]] Chinese English Language Second Speakers interviewed by individuals with a higher degree of social convergence in terms of ethnicity, sex, occupation, educational level, place of origin, and age were significantly more likely to converge to their interlocutor's standard English plural conjunction than those who were interviewed by subjects that differed more in terms of these social characteristics.{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}  Unlike previous studies that focussed mostly in ethnic solidarity to explain language variations in second language learners (Beebe and Zuengler, 1983), this later study proved that "it is not interlocutor ethnicity alone that causes linguistic variation, but a collection of attributes (of which one is ethnicity) by which interlocutors assess their relative similarity to each other... providing clear support for the similarity-attraction aspect of CAT".{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}

On the other hand, like the inter-group distinctiveness theory argues, several studies have revealed that when second language learners feel their social identity is threatened due to patronizing behavior towards their ethnic group they are more likely to engage in divergence. In a study conducted by Zuengler (1982) amongst Spanish and Greek speakers learning English, subjects were asked both ethnically threatening and neutral questions by a native English speaker. Those subjects that answered the ethnic-threatening question in a more personal form were noted to decrease the "native English-like pronunciations of the sounds" in their answers.{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}} Similar results were obtained in a study conducted by Giles and Bourhis conducted in Wales.  In this study Welshmen with strong ties to their nation and their language who were learning Welsh were asked questions about methods of second language acquisition.  In this study the questions were asked by an English speaker with an RP-sounding accent "...who at one point arrogantly challenged their reasons for what he called "... a dying language which had a dismal future."{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}}  In response to this question, which greatly threatened their identity and intergroup distinctiveness, the informants diverged considerably by strengthening their Welsh accents and using Welsh.{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}}

===Native language speakers===

Native language speakers frequently engage in "foreign talk" (FT) when interacting with second language learners. In this type of talk native speakers adopt features such as "slower speech rates, shorter and simpler sentence, more question and question tags, greater pronunciation articulation" amongst others.{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}} This is done to increase efficiency, especially when the native speakers perceive the non-native speakers as less competent communicators,{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}} or (as the similarity-attraction theory predicts) to increase attraction.  Foreign talk often contains features that mirror the mistakes made by non-native speakers in order to make speech more similar, and hence "NS may include ungrammatical features in their FT".{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}  As predicted by the inter-group distinctiveness theory, native speakers might also choose to refrain from engaging in FT or might use divergence, whenever they wish to maintain group distinctiveness, either because they have a lower perception of the other group, they feel threatened by them, or they wish to display [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentricity]].{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}

== Immigrants ==

Immigrants tend to converge according to what they perceive to be the prototypical behaviors of their new group, or according to the norms that they infer make part of their new environment.{{sfn|Gallois|Callan|1991}} Meanwhile, their new communities "also may hold norms, about how immigrants do and/or should use the majority language" and "convergence that is perceived by members of the host community as inappropriate to the speaker's status, the relationship, or the norms of the situation, may be labelled as ingratiating, condescending or gauche".{{sfn|Gallois|Callan|1991}} This might lead to a negative appraisal of the immigrant speaker. For this reasons, Gallois and Callan  (1991) suggest that it is important to teach immigrants about the norms that govern convergence in each community. Although other personal motives govern immigrant's linguistic choices later on, their expectations and the situational norms that they are able to perceive are what guide their linguistic choices when they are new to a culture.{{sfn|Gallois|Callan|1991}}

== Family communication dynamics and sexual identity ==
A research paper uses the basis of the Communication Accommodation Theory along with Intergroup Communication and relational Satisfaction to explain the perception of a family towards homosexuality and how family communication dynamics are impacted when one of the family member has a different sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=9&amp;sid=535c088a-c36c-43bc-bf22-479d73c3d4e3@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.b.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the study was conducted to understand how to parent such a child and the consequences of disclosure on the communication in the family. Sexual identity can be a challenging discussion for a family and revealing one's preferred identity led to topic avoidance under intergroup anxiety and the relational satisfaction was negatively viewed. Such a constrained communication made the individuals feel that their relationship with the family member was less fulfilling and eventually less satisfying.

==New media==
As communication accommodation theory explains "the cognitions and motivations that underlie interactants' communication" with context and identity salience,{{sfn|Jones| Watson|Gardner|Gallois|2006}} it's feasible to apply it to new media related settings. Even though research in this field is still at its early stage, interesting case studies have appeared in recent years.
Studies have investigated possible accommodative tendencies of librarians when faced with cyberlanguage use by the patron through instant messaging technology. Since use of cyberlanguage in VRS (virtual reference services) conversations has been suggested as one possible way to strengthen patron relations, patrons who are satisfied with their interaction with a librarian who use cyberlanguage may be more willing to return. However, the result suggests that patron's use of cyberlanguage has no influence on a librarian's use of cyberlanguage and surprisingly convergence doesn't happen.{{sfn|Christopherson| 2011}} Nevertheless, accommodation of communication styles do happen in other [[computer-mediated communication]] circumstances. In group [[brainstorming]] conversations, Chinese participants are likely to become as responsive as Americans when working in mixed-culture groups and more talkative when using lean medium.{{sfn|Wang|Fussell|Setlock| 2009}} The use of new media provides users an opportunity to more quickly provide or gather information without new or additional disruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garrett|first=R. Kelly|last2=Danziger|first2=James N.|date=October 2007|title=IM = Interruption Management?

==Case studies==

===Police officers===

Giles has also looked at the actions and attitudes in the public's interaction with [[police officer]]s, using accommodation theory.  Relational and identity aspects of this theory help to illustrate the interaction patterns that exist between the public and the police in the various situations in which these interaction take place.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  This study looked at both the accommodation patterns of the officers and the public with whom they were dealing.

In this case of policemen and accommodation, it is important for men and women of the force to find a stable balance between accommodating (displaying care, empathy, respect etc.,) and keeping a firm stance of authority. Studies show that the public believes policemen, overall, should work on being more community oriented and accommodating to all of its citizens, not only to reduce tension, anxiety, and stress, but to build trust and satisfaction between both parties. There are current, as well as up-and-coming community-based police programs to give citizens a more "informal", "down to earth", view of their commanding officers. However, even with all of these accommodations being made, it is necessary for there to remain an understanding of the higher power, so that in the case in life-threatening situations, men and women of the police force can continue to actively and effectively uphold society

===Pharmacists===

From November 2015 to April 2016, a study was conducted to observe the communication between pharmacists and patients during medication counseling sessions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chevalier|first1=Bernadette A. M.|last2=Watson|first2=Bernadette M.|last3=Barras|first3=Michael A.|last4=Cottrell|first4=William Neil|title=Investigating strategies used by hospital pharmacists to effectively communicate with patients during medication counselling|journal=Health Expectations|date=October 2017|volume=20|issue=5|pages=1121–1132|doi=10.1111/hex.12558}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was conducted in order to understand what is occurring during these exchanges. "Twelve pharmacists engaged four patients each for a total of 48 medication counselling interactions that took place".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During each session, the pharmacists were recorded by one of the main researchers, another pharmacist with no ties to the other pharmacists. In each recording, the main researcher (referred to as BC) specifically searched for five strategies of CAT: approximation, interpretability, discourse management, emotional expression and interpersonal control.

* "Approximation concerns how individuals adjust their speech patterns".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Speech in approximation can converge or diverge from the patient, but is appropriately applied with convergence
* "Interpretability strategies focus on each speaker's conversational competence".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that the speaker communicates in a way to ensure the speaker understands the content of the message.
* "Discourse management strategies involve conversation processes to promote conversation between interactants".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This involves using nonverbal or verbal cues to signal a person to speak or change the subject accordingly. 
* Emotional expression demonstrates "empathy and reassurance".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* "Interpersonal control focuses on the roles and power relations between speakers".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This strategy of CAT establishes common ground between the speakers in a form of equality.

Upon conclusion of this study, it was shown that most of the pharmacists used the five CAT strategies during their social exchanges with the patients; however, the presentations of discourse varied by pharmacist.

===''Speak Arabic please!'' A case study in communication accommodation ===

In Sonia S'hiri's ''Speak Arabic please!'': [[Tunisian Arabic|Tunisian]] Arabic Speakers' Linguistic Accommodation to Middle Easterners" she describes how speakers of Tunisian Arabic converge to the "[[Arabic language|Sharqi]]" or " Middle Eastern Arabic" of their co-workers.{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}}

One of the many ways to divide the [[Arab]] world is between the West ''[[Maghreb]]'' and the East ''Sharq''.  Though there is no official ''Sharqi Arabic'', the varieties usually associated with Sharqi Arabic are [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]], [[Levantine Arabic|Levantine]], and [[Persian Gulf/Iraqi Arabic]].  Due to [[Egypt]]'s dominance of the media and arts, the "Sharqi" Arabic spoken in the region has come to be perceived by Tunisians, as "lighter", more poetic and artistic, more humorous, more romantic and even more beautiful than the local [Tunisian] variety.{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}}  Again, because of its dominance in the media and the arts, Arabic speakers throughout the Arab world are much more familiar with "Sharqi" varieties than they are with "Maghrebi" varieties.  A common yet incorrect belief about speech interactions in the Arab speaking world is that when speakers of different varieties of the language come into contact with one another, the default language for communication is [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (Fusha).

In her study conducted in London, S'hiri examined the social reasons for Tunisian Arabs to converge linguistically to speakers of "Sharqi Arabic".  The data she found also gave ample evidence to show that code-switching into pure Fusha for communication is a misconception.  S'hiri recorded five Tunisian Arabic speakers (M1, M2, W1, W2, and W3) who worked at two different broadcasting companies and found that they did indeed converge linguistically to their Sharqi co-workers.  They did not however, resort solely to Fusha.  S'hiri found that when interacting with speakers of "Sharqi" Arabic, her Tunisian informants used linguistic features and [[Word|lexical items]] characteristic of the "Sharqi" variety, some English words, (instead of the [[French language|French]] words often used in Tunisian Arabic speech) in addition to switching to Fusha.  S'hiri found that many of her informants were proud of both their Tunisian variety of Arabic as well as their ability converge linguistically and even posits the idea of "showing off" as a goal of linguistic convergence".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}} Her findings lead to an interesting sort of paradox. Although the Tunisian Arabs abandon their own variety of the language, they do not experience a feeling of loss of identity, because the ability to code-switch, perceived as prestigious in their culture, makes part of their positive identity. Despite their inner feelings of pride for their own group, by accommodating to the Sharqi speakers the Tunisians are setting aside their ingoup identity in order to "promote their extended ethnicity as members of an Arab nation instead of just as Tunisians".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}} In terms of accommodation theory, Tunisians in [[London]] can be seen as the "ingroup" trying to assimilate to the "outgroup".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}}

When her informants were asked why they had switched to the "Sharqi" variety, they all agreed it was psychologically motivating, because it allowed them to get closer to their interlocutors.   M1 added that this allowed him to convey friendliness to his interlocutors, to reduce differences and avoid rejection.{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}} Informant W2 "Found that using TA [Tunisian Arabic] is an obstacle to getting closer to people.  She felt excluded especially at the beginning since Sharqis seemed to avoid her because they believed she would be difficult to understand".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}} W2 also "Claims that the level of readiness of Sharqis to understand her determines whether she uses TA with them or not.  She wants to avoid ridicule".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}}

'''Dam removal''' is the process of demolishing a [[dam]], leaving a river to flow freely. It is undertaken for a variety of reasons that include environmental rehabilitation, structural weakness and maintenance expense.

All dams negatively affect the aquatic environments of rivers that they are located on, but those effects are often negated by the stated purpose of the dam, whether it is hydroelectric power, flood control, or other functions. When the [[Environmental impact of reservoirs|negative environmental effects]] outweigh the benefits, a dam may be considered for removal. This happened on the [[Elwha River]] in [[Olympic National Park]] in Washington when extraordinarily rich salmon habitat was being disrupted by an out-dated hydroelectric plant. Before dams were built on the Elwha River, 400,000 salmon returned each year to spawn, but that number dropped to fewer than 3,000 after dams were put up.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/08/29/removing-dams-and-restoring-rivers/|title=Removing Dams and Restoring Rivers|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the hydroelectric power generating capacities of the dams had outlived their useful lives, the importance of this salmon habitat necessitated the removal of the dams on the Elwha River.

Dam failure is another threat that can lead to the removal of dams. Sometimes the fear of failure is due to seismic activity or the placement of the dam. Additionally, the older the dam is, the more likely it is to fail. Around the world, a growing number of 20th-century dam construction projects are reaching the end of their design lives: as of 1996, 5,000 large dams around the world were more than 50 years old.[1]  By 2020, in the United States alone, 85% percent of the country’s dams will have exceeded that 50 year threshold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Finally, economic reasons often provide a convincing reason to remove a dam. The cost of keeping outdated hydroelectric equipment running decades after it was installed or upgrading dam safety systems may not be worth it. Additionally, population centers and industrial facilities that demanded hydropower decades ago can move and leave the dam without a purpose.

Since around 2000, most major dam removal projects, and the largest single project, the $350M removal of two [[Olympic Peninsula]] dams as part of the [[Elwha Ecosystem Restoration]], have been driven by restoration of river habitat and fish passages.  Inspired by the Elwha project, a French group called ''SOS Loire Vivante'' successfully lobbied for the removal of two dams in the Upper [[Loire Valley]], and the re-engineering of a 1941 hydroelectric dam on the [[Allier River]] to restore habitat for [[Atlantic salmon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Xin|first1=Guo|title=French Dam Removal Opens Way for Atlantic Salmon|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/french-dam-removal-opens-way-for-atlantic-salmon-1632|accessdate=9 April 2016|publisher=internationalrivers.org|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States roughly 900 dams were removed between 1990 and 2015, with another 50 to 60 more every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Struck|first1=Doug|title=Setting rivers free: As dams are torn down, nature is quickly recovering|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2014/0803/Setting-rivers-free-As-dams-are-torn-down-nature-is-quickly-recovering|accessdate=9 April 2016|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  France and Canada have also completed significant removal projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhao-Yin Wang, Joseph H.W.

==Purposes and effects of dams==
[[Image:Grand Coulee Dam.jpg|thumb|right|Grand Coulee Dam, Columbia River, Washington, United States]]

Many of the dams in the eastern United States were built for [[water diversion]], [[agriculture]], factory [[watermill]]s, and other purposes that are no longer seen as useful. Because of the age of these dams, over time the risk for catastrophic failure increases. In addition, many of these dams block [[Fish migration#Classification|anadromous]] fish runs, such as [[Atlantic salmon]] and [[American shad]], and prevent important sediments from reaching [[estuaries]].

Many dams in the western United States were built for agricultural [[water diversion]] in the arid country, with [[hydroelectric]] power generation being a very significant side benefit. Among the largest of these water diversion projects is the [[Columbia Basin Project]], which diverts water at the [[Grand Coulee Dam]]. The [[Bureau of Reclamation]] manages many of these water diversion projects.

Some dams in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[California]] block passage for anadromous fish species such as [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]]. [[Fish ladder]]s and other passage facilities have been largely ineffective{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} in mitigating the negative effects on salmon populations. [[Bonneville Power Administration]] manages electricity on 11 dams on the [[Columbia River]] and 4 on the [[Snake River]], which were built by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]].

[[Image:Grand Canyon Horse Shoe Bend MC.jpg|thumb|right|Clear water below Glen Canyon Dam, Arizona, United States]]

In the [[Desert Southwest]], dams can change the nature of the river ecosystem. In the particular case of the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], the originally warm, sediment-filled, muddy water, instead runs cold and clear through the [[Grand Canyon]], which has significant impacts on the downstream ecosystems. Three native fish species have become extinct in the Grand Canyon and others are endangered since the dam was completed, including [[humpback chub]] and [[razorback sucker]].

Some dam projects, such as those on the [[Salt River Project]] in [[Arizona]], eliminate the flow of the river downstream, by diverting the flow into the [[Arizona Canal]] system for use in agriculture and urban usage, such that only a dry channel or [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]] heads out across the desert.

So much water is taken out of the [[Colorado River]] for agriculture, urban use, and evaporation behind the dams, that the river no longer flows into the [[Gulf of California]].

== Methods of removal ==
There are several ways dams can be removed and the chosen method will depend on many factors. The size and type of the dam, the amount of sediment behind the dam, the aquatic environment below the dam, who owns the dam and what their priorities are, and the timeframe of dam removal are all factors that affect how the dam will be removed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/hr/print/volume-31/issue-07/articles/sediment-strategies-choosing-a-sediment-management-option-for-dam-removal.html|title=Sediment Strategies: Choosing a Sediment Management Option for Dam Removal|website=www.hydroworld.com|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal is costly no matter what and expenses typically rise when greater weight is given to environmental concerns. Fortunately, the cost of dam removal is usually shared by multiple stakeholders such as the dam owner and either the federal, state or local government. Four of the most common dam removal methods are described below.

Sediment management is a driving force in all of them. A common problem for dams is how sediment carried naturally by the river is deposited in the reservoir and eventually fills it up with silt. This excess sediment reduces the hydroelectric generating capacity of a reservoir, changes the river channel downstream, traps nutrient-rich sediment behind the dam, and can put a dangerous amount of pressure on the dam itself. Oftentimes the sediment stored in a reservoir is good for the riparian corridor below the dam, can rebuild fish habitat, provide nutrients, and add onto a beach or estuary. Other times, the sediment can increase the turbidity of the river harming fish, scour the landscape, and bury infrastructure.
[[File:Notch and release approach at Glines Canyon Dam on Elwha River.jpg|thumb|288x288px|Here five notches can be seen at the Glines Canyon Dam as it was removed in a multi-year process.]]
Sediment can be tested before it is released to determine if it will be harmful to the landscape below the dam. Dam removal can have adverse consequences if this is not done. For example, when the Fort Edward Dam on the Hudson River was removed in the 1970s, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] in the sediment were released, affecting human and wildlife health downstream.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Notch and release approach ===
The notch and release approach is commonly used because of its ecological benefits. It is a slow method in which the reservoir is drained through notches cut into the dam. New notches are cut in so the water drains out of the reservoir at a consistent flow. The sediment trapped behind the dam flows downstream in a fixed rate that allows the ecosystem to adjust to the changes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This method can take months or even over a year but has proven success with restoring fish species to rivers. The [[Elwha Ecosystem Restoration|Elwha and Glines Canyon dam removal project]] used the notch and release approach to great success.

=== Rapid release approach ===
The rapid release approach is both the quickest and least expensive way to remove a dam, but comes with significant drawbacks. In this approach, a large tunnel is dug through the base of the dam and then connected to the reservoir. The entire body of water will drain through this tunnel in a matter of minutes or hours and the massive release of water and sediment can cause severe flooding and erosion along the river downstream for miles. This can devastate the riparian ecosystem along the river as well as dangerously scour bridge pilings, buried pipes, levees, and other infrastructure. However, if the reservoir held back by the dam is relatively small and quickly drains into a larger river or lake, this approach can be carried out with minimal impact on either the ecosystem or human infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Dig and dewater approach ===
The dig and dewater approach is typically the most expensive dam removal method, but is necessary in some cases. It entails emptying the entire reservoir, allowing the sediment to dry, and then transporting it to a safe location for disposal. It is costly and slow, but if the reservoir is located very near hydroelectric generating facilities that would be greatly impacted by released sediments, it may be necessary. Another situation is if the sediments behind the dam contain toxins. Hauling them away and disposing of them safely is important for the ecological health of the river.

=== Retained sediment approach ===
The retained sediment approach is the final commonly used approach and involves leaving the sediment behind where it is. To do this, the river or creek must be rerouted around the damsite which can prove expensive and challenging. This may be carried out in places where the dig and dewater approach makes sense, but are too remote to be cost-effective.

== Alternatives to removal ==
[[File:John Day Dam fish ladder.jpg|left|thumb|340x340px|Fish ladder at John Day Dam on the Columbia River.]]

While fewer than 1% of United States dams are being considered for removal, there has been a push in recent years to address the deficiencies in existing dams without removing them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These goals include maximizing the efficiency of existing dams and minimizing their environmental impact. Updating equipment and acknowledging that dams have a limited life span are two ways to achieve those goals. As part of them, a plan for decommissioning the dam and restoring the river should be drawn up long before the dam exceeds its design life. One part of river restoration that does not have to wait until the dam is removed is introducing [[environmental flow]]. Having variable amounts of water flow through the dam at different seasons mimics natural seasonal variations in water level from winter and spring storms. Additionally, [[fish ladder]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Fish ladder|s]] can be added to dams to increase the connectivity of a river and allow fish to reach their spawning grounds. There’s debate about the effectiveness of fish ladders, but generally some fish will make it through as opposed to zero fish spawning in their traditional location.

== Completed projects ==

[[File:Condit Dam.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Condit Dam, Washington, United States]]

* 1973 - Lewiston Dam, [[South Fork Clearwater River]], [[Idaho]] – The {{convert|39|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam was built in 1927 as a hydroelectric facility, but lacked [[fish ladders]]. Upon completion of the [[Lower Granite Dam]] and its reservoir, the lack of gradient on the river made it obsolete. Its removal improved salmon runs on the river.
* 1997 - Marie Dorian Dam, [[Walla Walla River]], Oregon – The {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam blocked passage to [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] into the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]] from the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]].
* 1999 - [[Edwards Dam]], [[Kennebec River]], [[Maine]] – Built in 1837, the {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam blocked access to [[Atlantic Salmon]] and [[American Shad]].  This was a landmark case in which a U.S. federal agency, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]], required the decommissioning and removal of a dam against the operator's wishes.
* 2004 - Embrey Dam, [[Rappahannock River]], [[Virginia]] - The 22-foot-tall, 770-foot-long, 1910 hydroelectric Embrey Dam was blown up with 600&amp;nbsp;lbs of explosives by the [[U.S. Army Dive team out of Ft. Eustis, VA]] on February 23, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrivers.org/our-work/restoring-rivers/dams/projects/embrey-dam.html|title=Dams and Hydropower|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of removal was to re-open miles of spawning grounds to aid populations of [[American Shad]], herring, catadromous American eel, and other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2006/022006/02232006/170364|title=Embrey Dam just a memory|work=Fredericksburg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The historical character of the [[Nils F.

* 2004 - [[Cuddebackville Dam]], [[Neversink River]], [[New York (state)|New York]] - Built in two portions dating from the 1820s (for water diversion into a canal) and 1915 (for hydroelectric power), the dam had been abandoned since 1945.  The dam was removed in October 2004 by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], in a novel partnership with the [[Nature Conservancy]], to benefit the aquatic life in the area, specifically the [[Dwarf Wedge Mussel]] and the [[American Shad]].
* 2007 - [[Marmot Dam]], [[Sandy River (Oregon)|Sandy River]], Oregon – The removal of this {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam by [[Portland General Electric]] has been extremely successful at improving access for [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] to the upper Sandy River watershed up into the [[Mount Hood Wilderness]].
* 2008 - [[Milltown Dam]], [[Clark Fork River, Blackfoot River (Montana)|Missoula]], Montana - Dam held startling levels of toxic sediments from 100 years of mining and logging. Removal improved water quality, trout habitat, and the general ecological condition of the watershed.
* 2009 - [[Savage Rapids Dam]], [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]], [[Oregon]] – Built for agricultural [[water diversion]], it was removed by the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] due to its out-dated facilities and non-functioning fish ladders that prevented fish migration past the dam.
* 2011 - [[Condit Dam]], [[White Salmon River]], Washington – The {{convert|123|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam blocked access for [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] runs on {{convert|33|mi|km}} of river. [[PacifiCorp]] proposed to remove the dam, rather than paying for fish passage upgrades. Removal was proposed in 2006, but actions from [[Skamania County, Washington|Skamania]] and [[Klickitat County, Washington|Klickitat]] counties held up the process. In fall 2008, salmon were trucked up above to dam to allow them to spawn higher up the river. In October 2011, PacifiCorp contractors used explosives to blow a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} hole in the dam to drain its reservoir and allow young salmon to enter the [[Columbia River]] and head to sea.
* 2012 - [[Elwha Dam|Elwha]] and [[Glines Canyon Dam]]s, [[Elwha River]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] – The largest dam removal project in history is the [[Elwha Ecosystem Restoration]] project on the [[Olympic Peninsula]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. Starting in 2012, and finishing in 2014, the {{convert|108|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Elwha Dam]] and the {{convert|210|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Glines Canyon Dam]] were removed to restore stocks of [[Pacific Salmon]] and trout species to the [[Elwha River]] watershed. The removal of these blockades allows migratory salmon to travel past the dam sites and upriver, an event that has not occurred since the dams' creation in 1913. After spawning there, the salmon die and their carcasses decompose, releasing marine nutrients laid down in their bodies as they fed in the open ocean. This reintroduction provides a valuable research opportunity for interested parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elwhascienceed.org/project-update/elwha-salmon-populations |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107035629/http://www.elwhascienceed.org/project-update/elwha-salmon-populations |archivedate=2009-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the dam removal, reservoir beds that looked like moonscapes have returned to vibrant rich habitat.

==Proposed removals==

===Lower Snake River Dams, Washington, US===

[[File:LGLandDam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Little Goose Dam]], Washington, USA]]

Four dams along the lower [[Snake River]], built and still operated by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], serve as hydroelectric power sources as well as maintaining an inland port at [[Lewiston, Idaho]] for agricultural barge traffic.  The four are candidates for removal because of millions of cubic yards accumulated behind the dams, which are raising water levels for riverside cities.  They include:  the 1975 {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Lower Granite Dam]], the 1970 {{convert|98|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Little Goose Dam]], the 1969 {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Lower Monumental Dam]], and the 1962 {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Ice Harbor Dam]].

Three million new cubic yards of sediment are deposited behind the lower four dams on the Snake River annually.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, E. (2007, February 16). Corps of engineers gets earful about sediment problems. Lewiston Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of Lewiston, Idaho and others along the Snake have built a system of levees maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers. The levees in Lewiston were designed to leave five feet between water levels and the top of the levees.  As of 2011, two feet remained.  As water levels continue to rise, either some of the dams must be removed or dredged, or the municipal levees will continue to be raised.  The Corps admits that the amount of sediment in the riverbed is too great for dredging to be effective, and Lewiston community leaders are worried that higher levees will further cut the town off from its rivers.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Restore Wild Salmon?"

===Rindge Dam and Matilija Dam, Southern California===

[[File:Rindge Dam.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rindge Dam]] near [[Malibu, California]], built in 1924, completely silted and abandoned by the 1950s]]

The {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} privately owned [[Rindge Dam]] on [[Malibu Creek]] in the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] of California was built in 1924 and has been allowed to completely fill with sediment, making it functionally obsolete but still a potential hazard.  Malibu Creek once supported the southernmost [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] population in the world. But today, steelhead no longer occupy the creek.

The similar 1947 [[Matilija Dam]] near [[Ojai, California]] was built against the advice of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], among others, and also blocked steelhead trout spawning grounds.  After being notched twice and largely silted up, 90% of its design capacity has been lost.  As of 2013 stakeholders agree that the dam and its sediment be removed, but no funding source has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlson|first1=Cheri|title=Delayed plan to remove Matilija Dam near Ojai will get new studies|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/delayed-plan-to-remove-matilija-dam-near-ojai-will-get-new-studies-ep-293034957-351781061.html|accessdate=11 April 2016|publisher=Ventura County Star|date=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Klamath River Dams, California / Oregon border===

{{main|Klamath River Hydroelectric Project}}

[[File:Klamath tribes dam removal demo.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstrators calling for removal of dams on the [[Klamath River]] in Oregon and California, USA]]

As resolution of several long-range issues centered on water rights in the [[Klamath Basin]], the multi-party [[Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement]] was signed in early 2008.  Parties to the agreement included the state of [[California]], the state of [[Oregon]], three Native American tribes, four counties, and 35 other local organizations and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement|url=http://klamathrestoration.gov/sites/klamathrestoration.gov/files/Klamath-Agreements/Klamath-Basin-Restoration-Agreement-2-18-10signed.pdf|website=Klamath Restoration|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This agreement called for the removal of four of the [[Klamath River Hydroelectric Project]] dams: the 1958 [[John C. Boyle Dam]], the 1922 [[Copco Number 1 Dam|Copco Number 1]] and Copco Number 2, and the 1964 [[Iron Gate Dam (California)|Iron Gate Dam]].  All four are privately owned by [[PacifiCorp]].  At the time PacifiCorp faced a relicensing cycle with [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]], with potentially expensive fixes for salmon passage and to address the growth of the toxic bacteria ''[[Microcystis aeruginosa]]'' in the Copco and Iron Gate Reservoirs.

On September 29, 2009, Pacificorp reached an agreement in principle with the other KBRA parties to remove the four dams, pending Congressional approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Fimrite | first=P. | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/30/MNMM19UDKH.DTL&amp;tsp=1 | title=Deal to raze 4 Klamath dams | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date= 30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress did not act, so as of February 2016, the states of Oregon and California, the dam owners, federal regulators and other parties reached a further agreement to remove all four Klamath basin dams by the year 2020, contingent only on approval by the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/New-plan-to-remove-Klamath-River-dams-without-6801869.php|title=New plan to remove Klamath River dams without help from Congress|first=Carolyn |last=Lochhead|date=3 February 2016|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new plan has been endorsed by the governors of California and Oregon, as well as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_29738226/klamath-river-dam-removal-deal-signed-by-top|title=Klamath River dam removal deal signed by top federal, state officials|first=Will | last=Houston |date=7 April 2016|publisher=Eureka Times-Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glen Canyon Dam, northern Arizona ===

[[Image:Glencanyondam.jpg|thumb|right|Glen Canyon Dam]]

The {{convert|710|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Glen Canyon Dam]] has been proposed for removal because of the negative effects it has on the water quality and riparian habitat of the [[Colorado River]] in [[Grand Canyon National Park]]. In addition, the reservoir impounded behind it, [[Lake Powell]] has filled all of the canyons for up to {{convert|160|mi|km}} above the dam. This lake, while providing recreational opportunities, has eliminated more than {{convert|160|mi|km}} of habitat for endangered [[Colorado River]] fish species.

The reservoir also loses more than 6 percent of the total annual flow of the Colorado River to evaporation and seepage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Glen Canyon?|url=http://www.glencanyon.org/glen_canyon/why-glen-canyon|work=Glen Canyon Institute|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of dam removal such as the [[Glen Canyon Institute]] also cite these losses of stored water as reason to decommission the dam.   If it were to be removed, it would dwarf any completed dam removal project in history.

{{Postmodernism}}

'''Deconstructivism''' is a movement of [[postmodern architecture]] which appeared in the 1980s, which gives the impression of the fragmentation of the constructed building.  It is characterized by an absence of harmony, continuity, or symmetry. {{Sfn|Taschen|Taschen|2016|page=148}}   Its name comes from the idea of "[[Deconstruction]]", a form of [[semiotic]] analysis developed by the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]].  Architects whose work is often described as deconstructionism (though in many cases the architects themselves reject the label)  include [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], and [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]. {{Sfn|Taschen|Taschen|2016|page=148}}    

Besides fragmentation,  Deconstructivism often manipulates the structure's surface skin and creates by non-[[Rectilinear polygon|rectilinear]] shapes which appear to distort and dislocate [[Design principles and elements|elements of architecture]]. The finished visual appearance is characterized by unpredictability and controlled chaos.

==History, context and influences==

Deconstructivism came to public notice with the 1982 [[Parc de la Villette]] [[architectural design competition]], in particular the entry from [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Peter Eisenman]]&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman, ''Chora L Works'' (New York: Monacelli Press, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; and the winning entry by [[Bernard Tschumi]], as well as the [[Museum of Modern Art]]’s 1988 ''Deconstructivist Architecture'' exhibition in New York, organized by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Mark Wigley]]. Tschumi stated that calling the work of these architects a "movement" or a new "style" was out of context and showed a lack of understanding of their ideas, and believed that Deconstructivism was simply a move against the practice of [[Postmodernism]], which he said involved "making doric temple forms out of plywood".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tschumi.com/news/33/ Rem Koolhaas and Bernard Tschumi in Conversation, 18 May 2001, ETH Zürich.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influential exhibitions include the 1989 opening of the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], designed by Peter Eisenman. The New York exhibition has featured works by [[Frank Gehry]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]], and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Since their exhibitions, some architects associated with Deconstructivism have distanced themselves from it; nonetheless, the term has stuck and has come to embrace a general trend within contemporary architecture.

===Modernism and postmodernism===
[[File:Seattle Central Library, Seattle, Washington - 20060418.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Seattle Central Library]] by [[Rem Koolhaas]] and [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture|OMA]]]]

The term "Deconstructivism" in [[contemporary architecture]] is opposed to the ordered rationality of [[Modern architecture|Modernism]] and [[postmodern architecture|Postmodernism]]. Though postmodernist and nascent deconstructivist architects both published in the journal ''[[Oppositions]]'' (between 1943 and 1954), that journal's contents mark a decisive break between the two movements. Deconstructivism took a confrontational stance to [[architectural history]], wanting to "disassemble" architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Tschumi, ''Architecture and Disjunction''&lt;/ref&gt; While postmodernism returned to embrace the historical references that modernism had shunned, possibly ironically, deconstructivism rejected the postmodern acceptance of such references, as well as the idea of ornament as an after-thought or decoration.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In addition to ''Oppositions'', a defining text for both deconstructivism and postmodernism was [[Robert Venturi]]'s ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'' (1966). It argues against the purity, clarity and simplicity of modernism. With its publication, [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] and [[Rationalism (architecture)|rationalism]], the two main branches of modernism, were overturned as paradigms. The reading of the postmodernist Venturi was that ornament and historical allusion added a richness to architecture that modernism had foregone. Some Postmodern architects endeavored to reapply ornament even to economical and minimal buildings, described by Venturi as "the decorated shed." Rationalism of design was dismissed but the functionalism of the building was still somewhat intact. This is close to the thesis of Venturi's next major work,&lt;ref&gt;Venturi, ''Learning From Las Vegas''&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and ornament can be applied to a pragmatic architecture, and instill the philosophic complexities of [[Semiotics|semiology]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The deconstructivist reading of ''Complexity and Contradiction'' is quite different. The basic building was the subject of problematics and intricacies in deconstructivism, with no detachment for ornament. Rather than separating ornament and function, like postmodernists such as Venturi, the functional aspects of buildings were called into question. Geometry was to deconstructivists what ornament was to postmodernists, the subject of complication, and this complication of geometry was in turn, applied to the functional, structural, and spatial aspects of deconstructivist buildings. One example of deconstructivist complexity is [[Frank Gehry]]'s [[Vitra Design Museum]] in Weil-am-Rhein, which takes the typical unadorned white cube of modernist [[art gallery|art galleries]] and deconstructs it, using geometries reminiscent of cubism and abstract expressionism. This subverts the functional aspects of modernist simplicity while taking modernism, particularly the international style, of which its white stucco skin is reminiscent, as a starting point. Another example of the deconstructivist reading of ''Complexity and Contradiction'' is [[Peter Eisenman]]'s [[Wexner Center for the Arts]]. The Wexner Center takes the archetypal form of the [[castle]], which it then imbues with complexity in a series of cuts and fragmentations. A three-dimensional grid, runs somewhat arbitrarily through the building. The grid, as a reference to modernism, of which it is an accoutrement, collides with the medieval antiquity of a castle. Some of the grid's columns intentionally don't reach the ground, hovering over stairways creating a sense of neurotic unease and contradicting the structural purpose of the [[column]]. The Wexner Center deconstructs the archetype of the castle and renders its spaces and structure with conflict and difference.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Deconstructivist philosophy===
[[File:ImperialWarMuseumNorth01.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Daniel Libeskind|Libeskind]]'s [[Imperial War Museum North]] in [[Trafford]], [[Greater Manchester]] (2002). An archetype of deconstructivist architecture, it comprises three fragmented, intersecting curved volumes, symbolizing the destruction of war.]]

Some Deconstructivist architects were influenced by the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]. Eisenman was a friend of Derrida, but even so his approach to architectural design was developed long before he became a Deconstructivist. For him Deconstructivism should be considered an extension of his interest in radical formalism. Some practitioners of deconstructivism were also influenced by the formal experimentation and geometric imbalances of Russian [[Constructivist architecture|constructivism]]. There are additional references in deconstructivism to 20th-century movements: the [[modernism]]/[[postmodernism]] interplay, [[Expressionist architecture|expressionism]], [[cubism]], [[minimalism]] and [[contemporary art]]. Deconstructivism attempts to move away from the supposedly constricting 'rules' of modernism such as "[[form follows function]]," "[[purism (arts)|purity of form]]," and "[[truth to materials]]."{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The main channel from deconstructivist philosophy to [[architectural theory]] was through the philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]'s influence with [[Peter Eisenman]]. Eisenman drew some philosophical bases from the literary movement [[Deconstruction]], and collaborated directly with Derrida on projects including an entry for the [[Parc de la Villette]] competition, documented in ''Chora l Works''. Both Derrida and Eisenman, as well as [[Daniel Libeskind]]&lt;ref&gt;Libeskind, Daniel. [http://www.daniel-libeskind.com/projects/show-all/imperial-war-museum-north/ "Imperial War Museum North Earth Time"] quote ''"This project develops the realm of the in between, the inter-est.... Pointing to that which is absent"''. Retrieved April, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; were concerned with the "[[metaphysics of presence]]," and this is the main subject of deconstructivist philosophy in architecture theory. The presupposition is that architecture is a language capable of communicating meaning and of receiving treatments by methods of linguistic philosophy.&lt;ref name="Curl"&gt;{{cite book|last=Curl|first=James Stevens|title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|year=2006|type=Paperback|edition=Second|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialectic of presence and absence, or solid and void occurs in much of Eisenman's projects, both built and unbuilt. Both Derrida and Eisenman believe that the locus, or place of presence, is architecture, and the same dialectic of presence and absence is found in construction and deconstructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman and Derrida, ''Choral Works''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Derrida, readings of texts are best carried out when working with classical narrative structures. Any architectural deconstructivism requires the existence of a particular archetypal ''con''struction, a strongly-established conventional expectation to play flexibly against.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, ''Of Grammatology''&lt;/ref&gt; The design of [[Frank Gehry]]’s own [[Santa Monica]] residence, (from 1978), has been cited as a prototypical deconstructivist building. His starting point was a prototypical suburban house embodied with a typical set of intended social meanings. Gehry altered its massing, spatial envelopes, planes and other expectations in a playful subversion, an act of "de"construction"&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, Robert (1994).[http://www.mindyourownweb.co.uk/hosted/index.php?view=mattaclarking&amp;pageid=85&amp;PHPSESSID=c5e9dc8f3f4a6cfd3bc3216856fe17d8 "Mattaclarking"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517013252/http://www.mindyourownweb.co.uk/hosted/index.php?view=mattaclarking&amp;pageid=85&amp;PHPSESSID=c5e9dc8f3f4a6cfd3bc3216856fe17d8 |date=2007-05-17 }} Dissertation Exploring the work of Gordon Matta-Clark. Retrieved April, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Derrida's concepts of the metaphysics of presence and deconstructivism, his notions of trace and erasure, embodied in his philosophy of writing and arche-writing&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, ''Of Grammatology'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; found their way into deconstructivist [[memorial]]s. Daniel Libeskind envisioned many of his early projects as a form of writing or discourse on writing and often works with a form of [[concrete poetry]]. He made architectural sculptures out of books and often coated the models in texts, openly making his architecture refer to writing. The notions of trace and erasure were taken up by Libeskind in essays and in his project for the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]]. The museum is conceived as a trace of the erasure of the [[Holocaust]], intended to make its subject legible and poignant. Memorials such as [[Maya Lin]]'s [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] and Peter Eisenman's [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]] are also said to reflect themes of trace and erasure.

===Constructivism and Russian Futurism===
Another major current in deconstructivist architecture takes inspiration from the Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] and [[Russian futurism|Futurist]] movements of the early twentieth century, both in their graphics and in their visionary architecture, little of which was actually constructed.

Artists [[Naum Gabo]], [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], and [[Alexander Rodchenko]], have influenced the graphic sense of geometric forms of deconstructivist architects such as [[Zaha Hadid]] and [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]. Both Deconstructivism and Constructivism have been concerned with the tectonics of making an abstract assemblage. Both were concerned with the radical simplicity of geometric forms as the primary artistic content, expressed in graphics, sculpture and architecture. The Constructivist tendency toward [[purism (arts)|purism]], though, is absent in Deconstructivism: form is often deformed when construction is deconstructed. Also lessened or absent is the advocacy of [[socialism|socialist]] and [[collectivism|collectivist]] causes.

The primary graphic motifs of constructivism were the rectangular bar and the triangular wedge, others were the more basic geometries of the square and the circle. In his series ''Prouns'', El Lizzitzky assembled collections of geometries at various angles floating free in space. They evoke basic structural units such as bars of steel or sawn lumber loosely attached, piled, or scattered. They were also often [[Technical drawing|drafted]] and share aspects with [[technical drawing]] and [[engineering drawing]]. Similar in composition is the deconstructivist series ''Micromegas'' by Daniel Libeskind.

{{Quotation|The symbolic breakdown of the wall effected by introducing the Constructivist motifs of tilted and crossed bars sets up a subversion of the walls that define the bar itself. ... This apparent chaos actually constructs the walls that define the bar; it is the structure. The internal disorder produces the bar while splitting it even as gashes open up along its length.|Phillip Johnson and Mark Wigley|Deconstructive Architecture|p. 34}}

===Contemporary art===
Two strains of modern art, [[minimalism]] and [[cubism]], have had an influence on deconstructivism. [[Analytical cubism]] had a sure effect on deconstructivism, as forms and content are dissected and viewed from different perspectives simultaneously. A synchronicity of disjoined space is evident in many of the works of [[Frank Gehry]] and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. [[Synthetic cubism]], with its application of [[found object]] art, is not as great an influence on deconstructivism as [[Analytical cubism]], but is still found in the earlier and more vernacular works of Frank Gehry. Deconstructivism also shares with minimalism a disconnection from cultural references. &lt;!---It also often shares with minimalism, notions of [[conceptual art]].{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} ---&gt;

With its tendency toward deformation and dislocation, there is also an aspect of [[expressionism]] and [[expressionist architecture]] associated with deconstructivism. At times deconstructivism mirrors varieties of expressionism, [[neo-expressionism]], and [[abstract expressionism]] as well. The angular forms of the Ufa Cinema Center by Coop Himmelb(l)au recall the abstract geometries of the numbered paintings of [[Franz Kline]], in their unadorned masses. The UFA Cinema Center also would make a likely setting for the angular figures depicted in urban German street scenes by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]]. The work of [[Wassily Kandinsky]] also bears similarities to deconstructivist architecture. His movement into abstract expressionism and away from figurative work,&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, "Point and Line to Plane"&lt;/ref&gt; is in the same spirit as the deconstructivist rejection of ornament for geometries.

Several artists in the 1980s and 1990s contributed work that influenced or took part in deconstructivism. [[Maya Lin]] and [[Rachel Whiteread]] are two examples. Lin's 1982 project for the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], with its granite slabs severing the ground plane, is one. Its shard-like form and reduction of content to a minimalist text influenced deconstructivism, with its sense of fragmentation and emphasis on reading the monument. Lin also contributed work for Eisenman's Wexner Center. Rachel Whiteread's cast architectural spaces are another instance where [[contemporary art]] is confluent with architecture. ''Ghost'' (1990), an entire living space cast in plaster, solidifying the void, alludes to Derrida's notion of architectural presence. [[Gordon Matta-Clark]]'s ''Building cuts'' were deconstructed sections of buildings exhibited in art galleries.

===1988 MoMA exhibition===
[[Mark Wigley]] and [[Philip Johnson]] curated the 1988 [[Museum of Modern Art]] exhibition ''Deconstructivist architecture'', which crystallized the movement, and brought fame and notoriety to its key practitioners. The architects presented at the exhibition were [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Coop Himmelblau]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Mark Wigley wrote the accompanying essay and tried to show a common thread among the various architects whose work was usually more noted for their differences.

{{Quotation|The projects in this exhibition mark a different sensibility, one in which the dream of pure form has been disturbed.

It is the ability to disturb our thinking about form that makes these projects deconstructive.

The show examines an episode, a point of intersection between several architects where each constructs an unsettling building by exploiting the hidden potential of modernism.
|Phillip Johnson and Mark Wigley, excerpt from the MoMA ''Deconstructivist Architecture'' catalog}}

===Computer-aided design===
[[Computer aided design]] is now an essential tool in most aspects of contemporary architecture, but the particular nature of deconstructivism makes the use of computers especially pertinent. Three-dimensional modelling and animation (virtual and physical) assists in the conception of very complicated spaces, while the ability to link computer models to manufacturing jigs (CAM - [[Computer-aided manufacturing]]) allows the mass production of subtly different modular elements to be achieved at affordable costs. In retrospect many early deconstructivist works appear to have been conceived with the aid of a computer, but were not; [[Zaha Hadid]]'s sketches for instance. Also, Gehry is noted for producing many physical models as well as computer models as part of his design process. Though the computer has made the designing of complex shapes much easier, not everything that looks odd is "deconstructivist."

==Critical responses==
Since the publication of [[Kenneth Frampton]]'s ''Modern Architecture: A Critical History'' (first edition 1980) there has been a keen consciousness of the role of criticism within architectural theory. Whilst referencing Derrida as a philosophical influence, deconstructivism can also be seen as having as much a basis in [[critical theory]] as the other major offshoot of postmodernism, [[critical regionalism]]. The two aspects of critical theory, urgency and analysis, are found in deconstructivism. There is a tendency to re-examine and critique other works or precedents in deconstructivism, and also a tendency to set aesthetic issues in the foreground. An example of this is the [[Wexner Center]]. [[Critical Theory]], however, had at its core a critique of capitalism and its excess, and from that respect many of the works of the Deconstructivists would fail in that regard if only they are made for an elite and are, as objects, highly expensive, despite whatever critique they may claim to impart on the conventions of design.

The difference between criticality in deconstructivism and criticality in critical regionalism, is that critical regionalism ''reduces'' the overall level of complexity involved and maintains a clearer analysis while attempting to reconcile modernist architecture with local differences. In effect, this leads to a modernist "vernacular." Critical regionalism displays a lack of self-criticism and a [[utopia]]nism of place. Deconstructivism, meanwhile, maintains a level of self-criticism, as well as external criticism and tends towards maintaining a level of complexity. Some architects identified with the movement, notably [[Frank Gehry]], have actively rejected the classification of their work as deconstructivist.&lt;ref&gt;Said Frank Gehry of Eisenman's [[Aronoff Center]], "The best thing about Peter's buildings is the insane spaces he ends up with.... All that other stuff, the philosophy and all, is just bullshit as far as I'm concerned." Quoted in Peter Eisenman, ''Peter Eisenman: 1990-1997'', ed. Richard C. Levene and Fernando Márquez Cecilia (Madrid: El Croquis Editorial, 1997), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of deconstructivism see it as a purely formal exercise with little social significance. [[Kenneth Frampton]] finds it "elitist and detached".&lt;ref&gt;Frampton, Kenneth. ''Modern Architecture: A Critical History''. Thames &amp; Hudson, 3rd edition, 1992, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikos Salingaros]] calls deconstructivism a "viral expression" that invades design thinking in order to build destroyed forms; while curiously similar to both Derrida's and Philip Johnson's descriptions, this is meant as a harsh condemnation of the entire movement.&lt;ref&gt;Salingaros, Nikos. "Anti-Architecture and Deconstruction", Umbau-Verlag, 3rd edition, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms are similar to those of deconstructivist philosophy—that since the act of deconstructivism is not an empirical process, it can result in whatever an architect wishes, and it thus suffers from a lack of consistency. Today there is a sense that the philosophical underpinnings of the beginning of the movement have been lost, and all that is left is the aesthetic of deconstructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Chakraborty, Judhajit; Deconstruction: From Philosophy to Design].

{{nihongo|'''Deep underground'''|大深度地下|dai-shindo chika}} is a Japanese concept for the public use of deep underground, enabled by a 2001 law. It was first thought of in the late 1980s as Japan faced ever-increasing land values in the [[Japanese asset price bubble|economic bubble]], to allow the utilization of heretofore-unused deep underground for necessary water and [[Common utility duct|utility ducts]] and other city [[tunnel]]s.

However, due to technical difficulties in ventilation, emergency procedures and other safety-related issues and the relatively high cost, no projects utilizing deep underground have been completed as of 2010.

==Definition==
* Depth greater than 40 meters or
* Depth 10 meters greater than the layer on which [[deep foundation]] rests
In the case of public use, no compensation to the land owner is required.

==Projects utilizing the law==
* Underground water mains in [[Kobe]] ([[Chūō-ku, Kobe]])
** Project approved on June 19, 2007 (first ever in Japan).
* [[Tokyo Gaikan Expressway]] (Tōmei Junction - Ōizumi Junction/Interchange)
** Project status elevated to construction stage on April 27, 2009.

==Projects anticipated to utilize the law==
* Capacity expansion of [[Chūō Main Line]] (extension of [[Keiyō Line]] from [[Tokyo Station]] to [[Mitaka Station]])
* Extension of [[Tsukuba Express]] from [[Akihabara Station]] to Tokyo Station
* [[Chūō Shinkansen]] (a total of 100&amp;nbsp;km of deep underground track in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka areas)
* [[Hanshin Expressway]] Route 2 Yodogawa-Sagan Line third phase (extension from Toyosaki, [[Kita-ku, Osaka]] to Hiejima, [[Kadoma, Osaka|Kadoma]])

[[File:Drexler-Smalley cover.jpg|thumb|The debate between [[K. Eric Drexler]] and [[Richard Smalley]] on the feasibility of [[molecular assembler]]s began in 2001 and concluded in a cover story in ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' in 2003.]]

The '''Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology''' was a public dispute between [[K. Eric Drexler]], the originator of the conceptual basis of [[molecular nanotechnology]], and [[Richard Smalley]], a recipient of the 1996 [[Nobel prize in Chemistry]] for the discovery of the [[nanomaterial]] [[buckminsterfullerene]]. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing [[molecular assembler]]s, which are [[molecular machine]]s which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.

The debate was carried out from 2001 to 2003 through a series of published articles and [[open letter]]s. It began with a 2001 article by Smalley in ''[[Scientific American]]'', which was followed by a [[Counterargument|rebuttal]] published by Drexler and coworkers later that year, and two open letters by Drexler in early 2003. The debate was concluded in late 2003 in a "Point–Counterpoint" feature in ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' in which both parties participated.

The debate has been often cited in the [[history of nanotechnology]] due to the fame of its participants and its commentary on both the technical and social aspects of [[nanotechnology]]. It has also been widely criticized for its adversarial tone, with Drexler accusing Smalley of publicly misrepresenting his work, and Smalley accusing Drexler of failing to understand basic science, causing commentators to go so far as to characterize the tone of the debate as similar to "a [[pissing contest|pissing match]]"&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"&gt;{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Steven A.  |title=The Nanotech Pioneers: Where Are They Taking Us?  |location=Weinheim |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2006 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "reminiscent of [a] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch".&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=Yes, They Can! No, They Can't: Charges Fly in Nanobot Debate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/09/science/yes-they-can-no-they-can-t-charges-fly-in-nanobot-debate.html|accessdate=5 July 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The participants==

===K. Eric Drexler===
[[File:Eric Drexler 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|K. Eric Drexler developed and popularized the concept of nanotechnology and founded the field of [[molecular nanotechnology]].]]

{{main|K. Eric Drexler}}

K. Eric Drexler is generally considered to have written the first scholarly paper on the topic of nanotechnology,&lt;ref name=edwardsdrexler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pelesko |first=John A. |title=Self-assembly: the science of things that put themselves together |year=2007 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=New York |isbn=978-1-58488-687-7 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a key figure in popularizing these concepts through several publications and advocacy work.&lt;ref name=edwardsdrexler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toumey|first=Christopher|title=Reading Feynman into nanotechnology: a text for a new science|journal=Techné|date=Fall 2008|volume=12|issue=3|page=133–168|doi=10.5840/techne20081231|url=http://litsciarts.org/slsa08/slsa08-650.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trained as an engineer, Drexler was inspired by a then-obscure 1959 talk by physicist [[Richard Feynman]] called ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]'', which posited that it should be physically possible to manipulate individual atoms using [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] engineering methodologies. Drexler was also inspired by recent advances in [[molecular biology]] such as [[recombinant DNA]] technology. In a 1981 publication in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', considered to be the first journal article on nanotechnology, he argued that biological systems such as the [[ribosome]] were already capable of building molecules atom-by-atom, and that artificial machines with this capability could also be constructed. Drexler went on to publish two books on nanotechnology: ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' in 1986, which was intended for the public, and the technical work ''Nanosystems'' in 1992. He also co-founded the [[Foresight Institute]], a public interest group devoted to increasing public awareness and information about molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="edwardsdrexler"&gt;Edwards, pp. 15–21, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drexler's vision of nanotechnology, now called [[molecular nanotechnology]], is based on the concept of the [[molecular assembler]], a [[molecular machine]] which would manufacture molecules and molecular devices atom-by-atom. Drexler drew a distinction between [[wet nanotechnology]] based on biological systems, and "second-generation" dry nanotechnology which would be based on [[mechanosynthesis]], positional control of molecules through principles more related to [[mechanical engineering]]. Drexler and his followers have focused almost exclusively on the latter form of molecular nanotechnology, but Drexler has stated that both are valid pathways to creating molecular machine systems.&lt;ref name="edwardsdrexler"/&gt;

===Richard Smalley===
[[File:Richard Smalley.jpg|thumb|250px|Richard Smalley won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with [[Harry Kroto]] and [[Robert Curl]] for their 1985 discovery of [[buckminsterfullerene]].]]

{{main|Richard Smalley}}

Richard E. Smalley, a chemist at [[Rice University]], was best known as a co-discoverer of the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; [[Allotropes of carbon|form of carbon]] known as [[buckminsterfullerene]] in 1985, along with [[Harry Kroto]], [[Robert Curl]], [[James R. Heath|James Heath]], and [[Sean O'Brien (scientist)|Sean O'Brien]]. Buckminsterfullerene was the first to be discovered of the class of molecules known as [[fullerenes]], which also includes [[carbon nanotube]]s. The study and application of fullerenes forms a significant part of the fields of [[nanomaterials]] and [[nanoelectronics]], and Smalley, Kroto, and Curl were awarded the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pp. 27, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalley had also taken a prominent [[public policy]] role in relation to nanotechnology, and was an outspoken advocate for using nanotechnology to develop solutions to the world's energy and health problems, for example raising the possibility of [[Energy applications of nanotechnology|using nanomaterials for efficient energy storage and transmission]], and of developing [[Nanomedicine|nanomaterial-based drugs]] for [[targeted drug delivery]]. Smalley was also active in commercializing his academic research into carbon nanotubes, having founded Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc., and serving on the scientific advisory board of two other biotechnology and nanotechnology [[Startup company|startups]]. Smalley died of [[leukemia]] in October 2005, after the conclusion of his debate with Drexler.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pp. 132, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berube"/&gt;

==The debate==

===Smalley's ''Scientific American'' article===
[[File:Drexler-Smalley SciAm cover.png|thumb|Smalley's 2001 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article doubting the feasibility of [[molecular assembler]]s led to a rebuttal by Drexler and his colleagues.]]

Smalley wrote an article, "Of Chemistry, Love, and Nanobots", for the September 2001 issue of the [[popular science]] magazine ''[[Scientific American]]'', which was a special issue on the topic of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=F90C4210-C153-4B2F-83A1-28F2012B637|date=September 2001| journal=Scientific American| title=Of Chemistry, Love and Nanobots| first= Richard E.| last= Smalley |pmid=11524973| volume=285| issue=3| pages=76–7| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0901-76| bibcode=2001SciAm.285c..76S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smalley opened by comparing a chemical reaction to an intricate dance of atoms:

{{Quote|When a boy and a girl fall in love, it is often said that the chemistry between them is good. This common use of the word "chemistry" in human relations comes close to the subtlety of what actually happens in the more mundane coupling of molecules. In a chemical reaction between two 'consenting' molecules, bonds form between some of the atoms in what is usually a complex dance involving motion in multiple dimensions.... And if the chemistry is really, really good, the molecules that do react will all produce the exact product required.}}

He referenced the idea of a [[molecular assembler]], a [[nanorobot]] capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product, posing the question of how long it would take such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material. He estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one [[Mole (chemistry)|mole]] of material, but [[Self-replicating machine|self-replicating]] assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond. Smalley then discussed the fear that the nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely, causing a [[grey goo]] scenario, or, referring to [[Bill Joy]]'s previous article "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]", that the nanorobots could develop [[swarm intelligence]] and become alive in some sense.

Smalley then considered how realistic the concept of a self-replicating nanorobot was. He noted that in a chemical reaction, the [[chemical bond]]s are all interconnected and that the placement of each atom is sensitive to the position of all the other atoms in the vicinity. He then asserted that a molecular assembler would thus have to control many atoms simultaneously in order to work, and would thus have to have many manipulator arms. This led him to raise two objections to the concept of molecular assembler, which he called the "fat fingers problem" and the "sticky fingers problem":

{{Quote|Because the fingers of a manipulator arm must themselves be made out of atoms, they have a certain irreducible size. There just isn't enough room in the nanometer-size reaction region to accommodate all the fingers of all the manipulators necessary to have complete control of the chemistry.... [Also,] the atoms of the manipulator hands will adhere to the atom that is being moved. So it will often be impossible to release this minuscule building block in precisely the right spot. Both these problems are fundamental, and neither can be avoided. Self-replicating, mechanical nanobots are simply not possible in our world.}}

Smalley closed the article by returning to the analogy of chemistry as a dance of love, remarking that "you don't make a girl and a boy fall in love by pushing them together."

===Drexler's response===
{{multiple image|direction=vertical|image1=Peptide syn.png|width1=250|image2=ScanningTunnelingMicroscope schematic.png|width2=250|footer=Top, a schematic of the [[ribosome]], which Drexler advanced as an example of a biological [[molecular machine]] due to its ability to precisely construct [[protein]] macromolecules from smaller [[amino acid]]s.

Bottom, a schematic of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]], which Drexler cited as being able to manipulate individual molecules via [[Mechanosynthesis|positional control]].|alt1=Ribosome schematic|alt2=Scanning tunneling microscope schematic}}

Drexler responded by publishing a rebuttal later in 2001 through the [[Institute for Molecular Manufacturing]], which was co-authored with others including [[Robert Freitas]], [[J. Storrs Hall]], and [[Ralph Merkle]].&lt;ref name="drexlerresponse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.php |title=On Physics, Fundamentals, and Nanorobots: A Rebuttal to Smalley’s Assertion that Self-Replicating Mechanical Nanorobots Are Simply Not Possible |publisher=Institute for Molecular Manufacturing |year=2001 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |first1=K. Eric |last1=Drexler |first2=David |last2=Forrest |first3=Robert A. |last3=Freitas |first4=J. Storrs |last4=Hall |first5=Neil |last5=Jacobstein |first6=Tom |last6=McKendree |first7=Ralph |last7=Merkle |first8=Christine |last8=Peterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors first discussed the "fat fingers" argument by attacking Smalley's notion that a chemical reaction must involve five to fifteen atoms, stating that many reactions involve only two reactants, one of which can be immobilized and the other attached to a single "finger". They cited as evidence experimental and theoretical results indicating that using [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) tips and related technologies could be used as a reactive structure for positional control and for interaction with surface-bound molecules. They also noted that atomically precise final products do not require precise control of all aspects of the chemical reaction. The authors noted that the "sticky fingers" problem is valid in some reactions, but argue that it would be fallacious to conclude that all reactions have this problem.

The authors put forth the [[ribosome]] as an example of a natural molecular machine; because the ribosome suffers from neither problem, they must not be fundamental, saying:

{{Quote|This ubiquitous biological molecular assembler suffers from neither the “fat finger” nor the “sticky finger” problem. If, as Smalley argues, both problems are “fundamental,” then why would they prevent the development of mechanical assemblers and not biological assemblers? If the class of molecular structures known as proteins can be synthesized using positional techniques, then why would we expect there to be no other classes of molecular structures that can be synthesized using positional techniques?}}

The authors also questioned Smalley's figures for the replication time of nanomachines. Instead of Smalley's figure of 1&amp;nbsp;GHz for the atomic placement frequency, they point out that ''Nanosystems'' suggested a frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, a thousand times slower, and that at Smalley's higher frequency diamondoid nanomachines would overheat and decompose in milliseconds. The authors called this a [[straw man]] argument, writing that "in a serious scientific discussion, a discrepancy of three orders of magnitude between what has been proposed in the literature and what is criticized suggests at best an inadequate grasp of the proposal."  The authors closed by stating that the best way to find out whether molecular assemblers are feasible is through experimental and theoretical work, and that "there are many worthy molecular systems engineering challenges to overcome, but thus far, there has been no credible argument that these devices are infeasible."

Drexler followed up with two open letters to Smalley in April and July 2003. The April letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=An Open Letter on Assemblers|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/Letter.html|publisher=Foresight Institute|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; began, "I have written this open letter to correct your public misrepresentation of my work."  Drexler accused Smalley of continuing to dismiss his work by publicly describing molecular assemblers as requiring what Drexler now calls "Smalley fingers", which he stated to be unlike the enzyme-like systems he had actually proposed. He asserted:

{{Quote|The impossibility of "Smalley fingers" has raised no concern in the research community because these fingers solve no problems and thus appear in no proposals. Your reliance on this straw-man attack might lead a thoughtful observer to suspect that no one has identified a valid criticism of my work. For this I should, perhaps, thank you.}}

Drexler compared the nanotechnology debate's importance to that of discussions of spaceflight before [[Sputnik]] or to theoretical work on [[nuclear chemistry]] before the [[Manhattan Project]]. He disputed Smalley's arguments that the fear of a grey goo scenario would hinder continued funding of nanotechnology research, arguing that the potential for long-term risks made research even more important. His conclusion stated, "your misdirected arguments have needlessly confused public discussion of genuine long-term security concerns."

The July 2003 letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=Toward closure|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/Letter2.html|publisher=Foresight Institute|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=2 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; referenced a note from Smalley promising to respond, which had yet gone unfulfilled. Drexler mentions inconsistencies in Smalley's previous public statements on atom-by-atom construction, and ended by stating "I would not ordinarily raise an issue so persistently, but the question of what nanotechnology can ultimately achieve is perhaps the most fundamental issue in the field today—it shapes basic objectives and expectations—and your words have been remarkably effective in changing how this issue is perceived."

===Exchange of letters in ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News''===
[[File:Nanob.jpg|thumb|A depiction of a putative [[technomimetic]] molecular [[planetary gear]] set. Smalley questioned whether devices like these could be constructed using an [[enzyme]]-like mechanical process, either in an [[aqueous solution]] or with some other chemistry, and whether such devices would be operational at all.]]

The debate was concluded in a "Point–Counterpoint" feature that was the 1 December 2003 cover story of ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'', the newsmagazine of the [[American Chemical Society]].&lt;ref name="counterpoint"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=Nanotechnology: Drexler and Smalley make the case for and against 'molecular assemblers' |journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume=81 |issue=48 |pages=37–42 |publisher=American Chemical Society |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |doi=10.1021/cen-v081n036.p037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The feature first reproduced Drexler's April 2003 open letter to Smalley. Smalley's response began by apologizing for any offense his September 2001 article had caused, and stating that Drexler's book ''Engines of Creation'' had triggered Smalley's own interest in nanotechnology. He agreed that "Smalley fingers" could not work, and then asserted that the same reasons that would preclude atomic control of reactions would also preclude the manipulation of larger building blocks, since each molecule would have multiple atoms which would need to be controlled

He then agreed that something like an enzyme or ribosome would be capable of precise chemistry, but asked how the nanorobot would be able to obtain, control, and repair such an enzyme, and noted the incompatibility of many reactions with water-based biological systems, stating that "biology is wonderous in the vast diversity of what it can build, but it can't make a crystal of silicon, or steel, or copper, or aluminum, or titanium, or virtually any of the key materials on which modern technology is built." Smalley asked what kind of "nonaqueous enzymelike chemistry" Drexler would envision for his molecular assemblers to operate upon, calling this "a vast area of chemistry that has eluded us for centuries."

Drexler's counterresponse began by returning to Feynman's 1959 talk, stating that "although inspired by biology... Feynman's vision of nanotechnology is fundamentally mechanical, not biological." He characterized the challenges as being that of [[systems engineering]] rather than solely chemistry, and referred Smalley to ''Nanosystems'', with its vision of mechanical control of chemical reactions with no enzymes and no reliance on solvents or thermal motion. He stated:

{{Quote|Positional control naturally avoids most side reactions by preventing unwanted encounters between potential reactants. Transition-state theory indicates that, for suitably chosen reactants, positional control will enable synthetic steps at megahertz frequencies with the reliability of digital switching operations in a computer. The supporting analysis for this conclusion appears in "Nanosystems" and has withstood a decade of scientific scrutiny.}}

Drexler reiterated that these molecular assemblers would require no impossible fingers, and would augment solution-phase chemistry to produce [[macroscopic]] products with precise arrangements of chemical building blocks, using solution-phase molecular assemblers to [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] the construction of more sophisticated assemblers. He concluded by writing:

{{Quote|U.S. progress in molecular manufacturing has been impeded by the dangerous illusion that it is infeasible. I hope you will agree that the actual physical principles of molecular manufacturing are sound and quite unlike the various notions, many widespread in the press, that you have correctly rejected. I invite you to join me and others in the call to augment today's nanoscale research with a systems engineering effort aimed at achieving the grand vision articulated by Richard Feynman.}}

Smalley began his concluding letter:

{{Quote|I see you have now walked out of the room where I had led you to talk about real chemistry, and you are now back in your mechanical world. I am sorry we have ended up like this. For a moment I thought we were making progress. You still do not appear to understand the impact of my short piece in Scientific American. Much like you can't make a boy and a girl fall in love with each other simply by pushing them together, you cannot make precise chemistry occur as desired between two molecular objects with simple mechanical motion along a few degrees of freedom in the assembler-fixed frame of reference. Chemistry, like love, is more subtle than that.}}

Smalley stated his belief that most reactions using mechanosynthesis would simply give the wrong product, and that very few reactions and target molecules would likely be compatible with such an approach. He asserted that any robotic assembler arm would need an enzyme-like tool at its end such would require a liquid medium, and as all known enzymes use water as that medium, the range of products must be limited to the "meat and bone of biology."  He accused Drexler of creating "a pretend world where atoms go where you want because your computer program directs them to go there."

Lastly, Smalley recounted his recent experience reading essays written by middle and high school students after an outreach visit, saying that nearly half of them thought that self-replicating nanorobots were possible and that most were worried about the results of them spreading across the world. Smalley called this a deeply troubling bedside story that he did his best to allay. Smalley concluded his letter:

{{Quote|You and people around you have scared our children. I don't expect you to stop, but I hope others in the chemical community will join with me in turning on the light, and showing our children that, while our future in the real world will be challenging and there are real risks, there will be no such monster as the self-replicating mechanical nanobot of your dreams.}}

==Critical response==
{{multiple image|direction=horizontal|image1=Raymond Kurzweil Fantastic Voyage.jpg|width1=160|image2=Lessig portrait.jpg|width2=150|footer=The Drexler–Smalley debate attracted commentary from figures such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] (left) and [[Lawrence Lessig]] (right).|alt1=Ray Kurzweil in 2005|alt2=Lawrence Lessig in 2009}}

===Tone===
The debate has been widely criticized for its adversarial tone. David Berube in ''Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz'' characterized it as "two people talking over each other... not conducive to reasonable rebuttal," and quoted nanotechnology blogger and journalist Howard Lovy as saying "the tenor of the debate is about personal pride, reputation, and a place in the pantheon."&lt;ref name="berube"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berube |first=David |title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2006 |url=http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1822/ |pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Zyvex]] founder James von Ehr remarked that "Eric [Drexler] didn't do himself any favors by getting into a [[Pissing contest|pissing match]] with a Nobel-prize winner."&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"/&gt;  An article in ''The New York Times'' called the debate "reminiscent of that old ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch... [with] Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin tossing insults at each other while ostensibly debating a serious political issue," referring to a version of the long-running [[Weekend Update#Jane Curtin (1976–1980)|Weekend Update]] segment.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

===Technical commentary===
The debate has received technical criticism as well. Steven A. Edwards in ''The Nanotech Pioneers'' noted that the ambiguity of the specifications and even definition of a molecular assembler makes an evaluation of the argument difficult and minimizes its scientific implications. He remarked that "nowhere in it does ''Nanosystems'' contain a blueprint for a molecular assembler... We are told, for instance, that a manipulator arm would involve 4,000,000 atoms, but we are not told which atoms, or how they would be put together."  He concludes that "the debate over mechanosynthesis so far is huge to the participants, but mainly an entertaining academic diversion to most nanotechnologists."&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"/&gt;

On the other hand, [[futurist]] [[Ray Kurzweil]] in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' declared Drexler as the winner of the debate,&lt;ref name="kurzweil"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-14-303788-9|pages=236&amp;ndash;241}}&lt;/ref&gt; reiterating the view that Smalley distorted Drexler's ideas and calling Smalley's responses "short on specific citations and current research and long on imprecise metaphors" and asserting that "Smalley is ignoring the past decade of research on alternative means of positioning molecular fragments using precisely guided molecular reactions... [which have] been extensively studied."  He quoted experimental results on enzyme function in nonaqueous solutions, and pointed out that modern non-biological technology such as airplanes and computers have exceeded the capabilities of natural biological systems. He also noted that "earlier critics also expressed skepticism that either worldwide communication networks or software viruses that would spread across them were feasible... [but today] we are obtaining far more gain than harm from this latest example of intertwined promise and peril."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-drexler-smalley-debate-on-molecular-assembly&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary on public perception of nanotechnology===
The debate's focus on the public perception of nanotechnology has also received commentary. Political blogger [[Glenn Reynolds]] stated that "the business community is afraid that advanced nanotechnology just seems too, well, spooky—and worse, that discussions of potentially spooky implications will lead to public fears that might get into the way of bringing products to market."&lt;ref name="berubesocial"&gt;Berube, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lawrence Lessig]] criticized the scientific establishment, represented by Smalley, for arguing that "if so-called dangerous nanotech can be relegated to summer sci-fi movies and forgotten after Labor Day, then serious work can continue, supported by billion-dollar funding and uninhibited by the idiocy that buries, for example, stem cell research."&lt;ref name="berubesocial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|title=Stamping Out Good Science|date=July 2004|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/view.html?pg=5|accessdate=12 July 2011|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kurzweil wrote that Smalley's approach to reassuring the public would backfire because it denied both the benefits and risks of molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="kurzweil"/&gt;

{{wiktionary|ejaculate}}
'''Ejaculation''' is the discharge of [[semen]] (normally containing [[sperm]]) from the [[Male reproductive system|male reproductory tract]], usually accompanied by [[orgasm]]. It is the final stage and natural objective of male [[sexual stimulation]], and an essential component of natural [[Fertilisation|conception]]. In rare cases, ejaculation occurs because of [[prostatic disease]]. Ejaculation may also occur spontaneously during [[sleep]] (a [[nocturnal emission]] or "wet dream"). ''[[Anejaculation]]'' is the condition of being unable to ejaculate. ''[[Painful ejaculation|Dysejaculation]]'' is an ejaculation that is painful or uncomfortable. [[Retrograde ejaculation]] is the condition where semen travels backwards into the bladder rather than out the [[urethra]].

==Phases==

===Stimulation===
{{anchor|Stimulation phase}}

{{see also|Sexual stimulation|Orgasm#In males|Intravaginal ejaculation latency time|Sexual arousal#Male physiological response}}
A usual precursor to ejaculation is the [[sexual arousal]] of the male, leading to the [[erection]] of the [[penis]], though not every arousal nor erection leads to ejaculation. Penile sexual stimulation during [[masturbation]] or [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]], [[Anal sex|anal]], [[Oral sex|oral]], or [[non-penetrative sex|non-penetrative]] sexual activity may provide the necessary stimulus for a man to achieve [[orgasm]] and ejaculation. With regard to [[intravaginal ejaculation latency time]], men typically reach orgasm 5–7 minutes after the start of penile-vaginal intercourse, taking into account their desires and those of their partners, but 10 minutes is also a common intravaginal ejaculation latency time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waldinger | first1 = M.D. | last2 = Quinn | first2 = P. | last3 = Dilleen | first3 = M. | last4 = Mundayat | first4 = R. | last5 = Schweitzer | first5 = D.H. | last6 = Boolell | first6 = M.|year=2005|title=A Multinational Population Survey of Intravaginal Ejaculation Latency Time|journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=2|pages=492–497|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2005.00070.x|pmid=16422843|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giuliano | first1 = F. | last2 = Patrick | first2 = D. | last3 = Porst | first3 = R. | last4 = La Pera | first4 = G. | last5 = Kokoszka | first5 = A. | last6 = Merchant | first6 = S. | last7 = Rothman | first7 = M. | last8 = Gagnon | first8 = D. | last9 = Polverejan | first9 = E.  | year=2008|title=Premature Ejaculation: Results from a Five-Country European Observational Study|journal=European Urology|volume=53|issue=5|pages=1048–1057|doi= 10.1016/j.eururo.2007.10.015|pmid= 17950985}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prolonged stimulation either through [[foreplay]] (kissing, petting and direct stimulation of erogenous zones before penetration during intercourse) or stroking (during masturbation) leads to an adequate amount of arousal and production of [[Pre-ejaculate|pre-ejaculatory fluid]]. While the presence of sperm in pre-ejaculatory fluid is thought to be rare, sperm from an earlier ejaculation, still present in the [[urethra]], may be picked up by pre-ejaculatory fluid.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} In addition, infectious agents (including [[HIV]]) can often be present in pre-ejaculate.

[[Premature ejaculation]] is when ejaculation occurs before the desired time. If a man is unable to ejaculate in a timely manner after prolonged sexual stimulation, in spite of his desire to do so, it is called [[delayed ejaculation]] or [[anorgasmia]]. An orgasm that is not accompanied by ejaculation is known as a [[dry orgasm]].

[[File:Ejaculation.ogg|thumb|Video of an ejaculation]]

When a man has achieved a sufficient level of stimulation, the orgasm and ejaculation begins. At that point, under the control of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], [[semen]] containing [[sperm]] is produced (emission).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Bruce M. | last1 = Koeppen | first2 = Bruce A. | last2 = Stanton, | title = Berne &amp; Levy Physiology | publisher = Elsevier/Mosby | location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-323-04582-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The semen is ejected through the [[urethra]] with rhythmic [[Muscle contraction|contractions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Walter F. | last1 = Boron | first2 = Emile L. | last2 = Boulpaep | title = Medical Physiology: A Cellular and Molecular Approach | publisher = Elsevier/Saunders | location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-4160-2328-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rhythmic contractions are part of the male orgasm. They are generated by the [[bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbospongiosus]] and [[pubococcygeus muscle|pubococcygeus]] muscles&lt;ref name=Marieb&gt;{{cite book | last = Marieb | first = Elaine | title = Anatomy &amp; physiology | publisher = Benjamin-Cummings | location =  | page= 895 | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780321887603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; under the control of a [[spinal reflex]] at the level of the [[spinal nerve]]s S2–4 via the [[pudendal nerve]]. The typical male orgasm lasts several seconds.

After the start of orgasm, pulses of semen begin to flow from the urethra, reach a peak discharge and then diminish in flow. The typical orgasm consists of 10 to 15 contractions, although the man is unlikely to be consciously aware of that many. Once the first contraction has taken place, ejaculation will continue to completion as an involuntary process. At this stage, ejaculation cannot be stopped. The rate of contractions gradually slows during the orgasm. Initial contractions occur at an average interval of 0.6 seconds with an increasing increment of 0.1 seconds per contraction. Contractions of most men proceed at regular rhythmic intervals for the duration of the orgasm. Many men also experience additional irregular contractions at the conclusion of the orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal  | last = Bolen | first = J. G., |pmid=7458658| title=The male orgasm: pelvic contractions measured by anal probe | journal= Archives of Sexual Behavior| date= 1980-12-09| issue=6 | pages=503–21 | doi = 10.1007/BF01542155 | volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ejaculation usually begins during the first or second contraction of orgasm. For most men, the first ejection of semen occurs during the second contraction, while the second is typically the largest expelling 40% or more of total semen discharge. After this peak, the magnitude of semen the penis emits diminishes as the contractions begin to lessen in intensity. The muscle contractions of the orgasm can continue after ejaculation with no additional semen discharge occurring. A small sample study of seven men showed an average of 7 spurts of semen followed by an average of 10 more contractions with no semen expelled. This study also found a high correlation between number of spurts of semen and total ejaculate volume, i.e., larger semen volumes resulted from additional pulses of semen rather than larger individual spurts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Gerstenburg | first = T. C. | pmid=2340374 | title= Erection and ejaculation in man.

[[Alfred Kinsey]] measured the distance of ejaculation, in "some hundreds" of men. In three-quarters of men tested, ejaculate "is propelled with so little force that the liquid is not carried more than a minute distance beyond the tip of the penis." In contrast to those test subjects, Kinsey noted "In other males the semen may be propelled from a matter of some inches to a foot or two, or even as far as five or six and (rarely) eight feet".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Kinsey | first1 = A.

===Refractory period===
Most men experience a [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] immediately following an orgasm, during which time they are unable to achieve another erection, and a longer period again before they are capable of achieving another ejaculation. During this time a male feels a deep and often pleasurable sense of relaxation, usually felt in the groin and thighs. The duration of the refractory period varies considerably, even for a given individual. Age affects the recovery time, with younger men typically recovering faster than older men, though not universally so.&lt;ref name="M&amp;J"/&gt;

Whereas some men may have refractory periods of 15 minutes or more, some men are able to experience sexual arousal immediately after ejaculation. A short recovery period may allow partners to continue sexual play relatively uninterrupted by ejaculation. Some men may experience their penis becoming hypersensitive to stimulation after ejaculation, which can make sexual stimulation unpleasant even while they may be sexually aroused.

There are men who are able to achieve multiple orgasms, with or without the typical sequence of ejaculation and refractory period. Some of those men report not noticing refractory periods, or are able to maintain erection by "sustaining sexual activity with a full erection until they passed their refractory time for orgasm when they proceeded to have a second or third orgasm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Dunn | first1 = M.E. | last2 = Trost | first2 = J.E.|year=1989|title=Male Multiple Orgasms: A Descriptive Study|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=18|pages=377–387|doi=10.1007/BF01541970|pmid=2818169|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume===
The force and amount of semen that will be ejected during an ejaculation will vary widely between men and may contain between 0.1 and 10 [[milliliter]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Fertility and Sterility | volume=26 | issue=6 | pages=492–502 | year=1975  | last1 = Rehan | first1 = N. | last2 = Sobrero | first2 = A.J. | last3 = Fertig | first3 = J.W. | title=The semen of fertile men: statistical analysis of 1300 men | pmid=1169171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (by way of comparison, note that a [[teaspoon]] is 5 ml and a tablespoon holds 15 ml). Adult semen volume is affected by the time that has passed since the previous ejaculation; larger semen volumes are seen with greater durations of abstinence. The duration of the stimulation leading up to the ejaculation can affect the volume.&lt;ref name="masturbation duration study"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Physiol Behav | volume=76 | issue=4–5 | pages=685–9 | year=2002  | last1 = Pound | first1 = N. | last2 = Javed | first2 = M.H. | last3 = Ruberto | first3 = C. | last4 = Shaikh | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Del Valle | first5 = A.P. | title=Duration of sexual arousal predicts semen parameters for masturbatory ejaculates | pmid=12127009 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9384(02)00803-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abnormally low semen volume is known as [[hypospermia]]. One of the possible underlying causes of low volume or complete lack of semen is [[ejaculatory duct obstruction]]. It is normal for the amount of semen to diminish with age.

===Quality===
{{Main|Semen quality}}
The number of sperm in an ejaculation also varies widely, depending on many factors, including the time since the last ejaculation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/semenandsperm.htm | title=Semen and sperm quality | publisher=Dr John Dean, netdoctor.co.uk | accessdate=2009-03-04| date=2015-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; age, stress levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/biobasis/bio_2.htm  | title= Biological Basis of Heredity: Cell Reproduction | publisher=Dr. Dennis O'Neil, Behavioral Sciences Department, Palomar College, San Marcos, California | accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[testosterone]]. Greater lengths of sexual stimulation immediately preceding ejaculation can result in higher concentrations of sperm.&lt;ref name="masturbation duration study" /&gt; An unusually low sperm count, not the same as low semen volume, is known as [[oligospermia]], and the absence of any sperm from the semen is termed [[azoospermia]].

==Development==

===During puberty===
[[File:Male anatomy.png|thumb|right|360px|Diagram of the male pelvic and reproductive organs]]
The first ejaculation in males often occurs about 12 months after the onset of [[puberty]], generally through [[masturbation]] or [[nocturnal emission]] (wet dreams). This first [[semen]] volume is small. The typical ejaculation over the following three months produces less than 1 ml of semen. The semen produced during early puberty is also typically clear. After ejaculation this early semen remains jellylike and, unlike semen from mature males, fails to [[Liquefaction|liquefy]]. A summary of semen development is shown in Table 1.

Most first ejaculations (90 percent) lack sperm. Of the few early ejaculations that do contain sperm, the majority of sperm (97%) lack motion. The remaining sperm (3%) have abnormal motion.&lt;ref name="Janczewski"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janczewski | first1 = Z. | last2 = Bablok | first2 = L.  | year=1985| title=Semen Characteristics in Pubertal Boys| journal= Archives of Andrology | volume=15 | pages= 199–205 | pmid= 3833078| doi=10.3109/01485018508986912 | issue = 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the male proceeds through puberty, the semen develops mature characteristics with increasing quantities of normal sperm. Semen produced 12 to 14 months after the first ejaculation liquefies after a short period of time. Within 24 months of the first ejaculation, the semen volume and the quantity and characteristics of the sperm match that of adult male semen.&lt;ref name="Janczewski" /&gt;

===Control from the central nervous system===
There is a [[central pattern generator]] in the [[spinal cord]], made up of groups of [[spinal interneuron]]s, that is involved in the rhythmic response of ejaculation. This is known as the ''spinal generator for ejaculation''.&lt;ref name="Guertin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guertin |first1=PA |title=Central pattern generator for locomotion: anatomical, physiological, and pathophysiological considerations. |journal=Frontiers in Neurology |date=2012 |volume=3 |pages=183 |doi=10.3389/fneur.2012.00183 |pmid=23403923|pmc=3567435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hands-free ejaculation===
Although uncommon, some men can achieve ejaculations during masturbation without any manual stimulation. Such men usually do it by tensing and flexing their abdominal and buttocks muscles along with vigorous fantasising. Others may do it by relaxing the area around the penis, which may result in harder erections especially when hyperaroused.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pOqRZTMc_T0C&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage The Rough Guide to Sex] retrieved February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perineum pressing and retrograde ejaculation===
[[Perineum]] pressing results in an ejaculation which is purposefully held back by pressing on either the perineum or the urethra to force the seminal fluid to remain inside. In such a scenario, the seminal fluid stays inside the body and goes to the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]. Some people do this to avoid making a mess by keeping all the semen inside.&lt;ref&gt;65+ --Gateway to Sexual Adventure: For Women and Men, Herb Hirata - 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As a medical condition, it is called [[retrograde ejaculation]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrology: Male Reproductive Health and Dysfunction - Page 317, E. Nieschlag, Hermann M. Behre, Susan Nieschlag - 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health issues==
For most men, no detrimental health effects have been determined from ejaculation itself or from frequent ejaculations,{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} though sexual activity in general can have health or psychological consequences. A small fraction of men have a disease called [[postorgasmic illness syndrome]] (POIS), which causes severe muscle pain throughout the body and other symptoms immediately following ejaculation. The symptoms last for up to a week.&lt;ref name=Balon2005&gt;{{cite book | title=Handbook of Sexual Dysfunction | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | editor=Balon R, Segraves RT | year=2005 | isbn=9780824758264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wylie2015&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oH64CAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Post%20orgaasmic%20illness%20syndrome&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=Post-orgasmic%20illness%20syndrome | title=ABC of Sexual Health | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2015 | page=75 | isbn=9781118665565 | editor=Wylie KR | accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GARD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Postorgasmic illness syndrome | encyclopedia=Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) | publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] | accessdate=30 July 2015 | year=2015 | url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10809/postorgasmic-illness-syndrome/resources/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some doctors speculate that the frequency of POIS "in the population may be greater than has been reported in the academic literature",&lt;ref name=Ashby2010&gt;{{cite journal | title=Postorgasm illness syndrome--a spectrum of illnesses. | author=Ashby J, Goldmeier D | journal=J.

'''Entrance grave''' is a term given by [[archaeologist]]s to a type of [[megalithic]] [[chamber tomb]] found in parts of [[Atlantic Europe]], dating the early to middle [[Bronze Age]].

Tombs of this type are covered with a round earth mound and contain a single chamber where the entrance area merges with the burial area itself, simply through a slight change in the alignment of the stone slab walls. They are also known as '''undifferentiated passage graves'''.

Entrance graves are found in Southern Spain and all along the Atlantic coast to [[Brittany]]. They are also present in southern [[Ireland]], the [[Isles of Scilly]] and [[Cornwall]].

An example is the [[Scillonian entrance grave]] group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7514">'''Fixes that fail''' is a [[system archetype]] that in [[system dynamics]] is used to describe and analyze a situation, where a fix effective in the short-term creates [[unintended consequence|side effects]] for the long-term behaviour of the [[system]] and may result in the need of even more fixes.&lt;ref name="5th"&gt;Senge, Peter M., "The Fifth Discipline" (1990). {{ISBN|0-385-26095-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This archetype may be also known as fixes that backfire&lt;ref name=pegas&gt;[http://www.pegasuscom.com/course_preview/module6/6-05-0-0-fixes.htm Fixes that backfire] Isee systems, 2006. Retrieved 2011-11-01&lt;/ref&gt; or corrective actions that fail.&lt;ref name="re5"&gt;Flood, Robert L., "Rethinking The Fifth Discipline: learning within the unknowable" (1999). {{ISBN|0-203-02855-4}} p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; It resembles the [[System Archetypes#Shifting the burden|Shifting the burden]] archetype.&lt;ref name="braun"&gt;{{Cite web |last= Braun |first= William |title= System archetypes |year= 2002 |url=http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/~gossimit/pap/sd/wb_sysarch.pdf |format=pdf|accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
In a "fixes that fail" scenario the encounter of a problem is faced by a corrective action or fix that seems to solve the issue. However, this action leads to some unforeseen consequences. They form then a [[feedback]] loop that either worsens the original problem or creates a related one.&lt;ref name="pegas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="re5" /&gt;
[[File:ftf.jpg|none|framed|'''Fig. 1: Causal loop diagram''']]

In [[system dynamics]] this is described by a [[causal loop diagram|circles of causality]] (Fig. 1) as a system consisting of two [[feedback]] loops. One is the [[negative feedback|balancing feedback]] loop B1 of the corrective action, the second is the [[positive feedback|reinforcing feedback]] loop R2 of the unintended consequences. These influence the problem with a delay and therefore make it difficult to recognize the source of the new rise of the problem.&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;

Representation of the long-term disadvantages of the scenario can be seen on Fig. 2. Although the symptoms go through a decrease when fixes are applied, the overall crisis threshold rises.&lt;ref name="braun" /&gt;&lt;ref name=kim&gt;Kim, Daniel H., "Fixes that Fail: Why Faster is Slower," ''The Systems Thinker Newsletter,'' Vol. 10, No. 3 (Apr., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:ftfgraph.png|none|framed|'''Fig. 2: Behavior over time''']]

A representation with a [[stock and flow]] diagram of this [[archetype]] is on Fig. 3.
[[File:Ftfstockflow.png|none|framed|'''Fig. 3: Stock and flow diagram''']]
The fix influences the number of problems present in the system proportionally to the fix factor and the problems to be resolved. When activated by the action variable, the fix lowers the problems, thus creating a balancing loop. However, each fix also starts a delayed consequence which adds to the problems proportionally to the consequence factor and the fix applied. Combined, these create a growing number of problems to be dealt with.

== Uses ==
As an archetype, it helps to gain insight into patterns that are present in the system and thereby also give the tools to change these patterns. In the case of "Fixes that fail", the warning sign is a problem which reappears although fixes were applied. It is crucial to recognize that the fix only adds to the overall deteriorating state and does not solve the problem. To identify this pattern, it is needed to consider a connection between the symptoms and the fixes we apply to solve them, which can be very difficult to do.&lt;ref name="braun" /&gt; In management this can be present as a "hero-scapegoat" cycle. While the manager who applied the fix gets promoted for diminishing the problem. A new manager must face the returning problem symptom and may be punished for failing to do his job. Then a new hero is found who temporarily solves the problem symptoms. The delay of the reinforcing loop makes it difficult to recognize the causal relation between the fix applied to the symptoms and the new problems arising. What then seems to be a series of successes in short-term then are steps towards failure on the long-term.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt;

Some typical ways of thinking associated with the pattern are:
* "It always seemed to work before; why isn't it working now?"&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;
* "This is a simple problem and the solution is straightforward."&lt;ref name=syswiki&gt;[http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Category:Fixes_that_Fail Fixes That Fail Archetype] SystemsWiki, October 2010. Retrieved 2011-11-01&lt;/ref&gt;
* "We need to fix this problem now. We can deal with any consequences later." &lt;ref name=syswiki /&gt;
They can serve as a warning that this archetype is present or will be. 

If this pattern is recognized, then there are multiple possibilities how to react, depending on which [[lever]]age point is addressed:
* Focus on the long-term and if a fix is inevitably needed, use it only to buy time to work on the long-term remedy.&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;
* Raise awareness of the unintended consequences of the fixes.
* Focus on the underlying problem and not the symptoms.
* Find either a fix without consequences or with limited long-term impact.&lt;ref name="pegas" /&gt;
* Find a way to measure the intended and also unintended consequences of the solutions by learning also from the past fixes.&lt;ref name="braun" /&gt;
* Change the performance review time so that the long-term progress becomes visible.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt;

== Examples ==
A few common examples of the pattern. The situation describes always the starting point to which a fix is applied. This bears then the consequences which are confronted again with a new fix.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Maximizing ROR'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;
:'''Situation''': A manufacturing company becomes successful with high-performance parts, and its CEO wants to maximize the [[Rate of return|ROR]].
:'''Fix''': Refusal of investment in expensive, new production machines.
:'''Consequences''': The product quality drops and therefore the sales of it.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Cutting back maintenance'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;
: '''Situation''': The company needs to [[saving|save]] money.
: '''Fix''': Decrease the amount of [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]].
: '''Consequences''': More breakdowns of the equipment, higher costs and cost-cutting pressure.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Quest for water'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name=syswiki /&gt;
: '''Situation''': Farmers are confronted with water shortage.
: '''Fix''': Drilling new wells or making the old ones deeper.
: '''Consequences''': The [[water table]] drops.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Cash shortage'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name=kim /&gt;&lt;ref name=syswiki /&gt;
: '''Situation''': A person can't pay [[interest]] (for example on a [[credit card]]).
: '''Fix''': Take up a new [[loan]] to pay the interest (a new credit card).
: '''Consequences''': There is more interest to pay next time.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Tax revenue shortage'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name=syswiki /&gt;
: '''Situation''': A government is not satisfied with its [[tax revenue]]s.
: '''Fix''': Increase the cigarette tax to raise more taxes.
: '''Consequences''': Smuggling of cigarettes develops and reduces the number of taxed cigarettes sold in the country.

==Early life and education==
Singer was born in Vienna, Austria, to a Jewish family, where his father was a jeweler and his mother a homemaker. When the Nazis invaded, the family fled, Singer leaving on a children's transport train with other Jewish children. He ended up in England, where he lived in [[Northumberland]], working for a time as a teenage optician. Several years later he emigrated to Ohio and became an American citizen in 1944.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, William Kenneth. ''The Change in the Weather''. Delta 2001, p. 245. Some of the details given by Scheuering and Stevens of Singer's flight from Vienna and the timing of it appear inconsistent. In fact Scheuering does not even mention such a flight: Scheuering does not even say that the family was Jewish. According to Scheuering the family was already in England in 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; He received a B.E.E. in electrical engineering from [[Ohio State University]] in 1943, and an A.M. in physics from [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1944. He taught physics at Princeton while he worked on his masters and his doctorate, obtaining his Ph.D. there in 1948. His doctoral thesis was titled, "''The density spectrum and latitude dependence of extensive cosmic ray air showers''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Singer, S.

==Career==

===1950: United States Navy===
After his masters, Singer joined the Armed Forces, working for the United States Navy on [[Naval mine|mine warfare]] and countermeasures from 1944 until 1946. While with the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]] he developed an arithmetic element for an electronic [[digital calculator]] that he called an "electronic brain". He was discharged in 1946 and joined the Upper Atmosphere Rocket Program at the Johns Hopkins University [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] in Silver Spring, Maryland, working there until 1950. He focused on [[ozone]], [[cosmic ray]]s, and the [[ionosphere]], all measured using balloons and rockets launched from [[White Sands, New Mexico]], or from ships out at sea. [[Rachel White Scheuering]] writes that for one mission to launch a rocket, he sailed with a naval operation to the [[Arctic]], and also conducted rocket launching from ships at the equator.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;

From 1950 to 1953, he was attached to the U.S. Embassy in London as a scientific [[liaison officer]] with the [[Office of Naval Research]], where he studied research programs in Europe into [[cosmic radiation]] and [[nuclear physics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Current biography yearbook'', Volume 10, H. W. Wilson Company, 1956; [http://www.sepp.org/about%20sepp/bios/singer/cvsfs.html S. Fred Singer, Ph.D.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928135220/http://www.sepp.org/about%20sepp/bios/singer/cvsfs.html |date=2006-09-28 }}, Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project, accessed May 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he was one of eight delegates with a background in [[guided weapons]] projects to address the Fourth International Congress of Astronautics in Zurich in August 1953, at a time when, as ''The New York Times'' reported, most scientists saw [[space flight]] as thinly disguised science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Hillaby, John.

===1951: Design of early satellites===
[[File:MOUSE (Fred Singer).jpg|thumb|200px|Singer's MOUSE satellite, which he designed in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name=mouse/&gt;]]

Singer was one of the first scientists to urge the launching of earth satellites for scientific observation during the 1950s.&lt;ref name=NYTJuly1962/&gt; In 1951 or 1952 he proposed the MOUSE ("Minimal Orbital Unmanned Satellite, Earth"), a {{convert|100|lb}} satellite that would contain [[Geiger counter]]s for measuring [[cosmic rays]], photo cells for scanning the Earth, [[telemetry]] electronics for sending data back to Earth, a magnetic data storage device, and rudimentary [[solar cell|solar energy cell]]s. Although MOUSE never flew, the ''Baltimore News Post'' reported in 1957 that had Singer's arguments about the need for satellites been heeded, the U.S. could have beaten Russia by launching the [[Sputnik 1|first earth satellite]].&lt;ref name=mouse&gt;[http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19731670000 "Satellite, MOUSE, Concept Model"], Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, accessed May 15, 2010; for a diagram of the MOUSE and ''Baltimore News Post'' reference, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20150621055347/http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/U1294093INP/diagram-of-mouse-satellite Diagram of MOUSE satellite], Corbis Images, accessed May 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He also proposed (along with R. C. Wentworth) that satellite measurement of ultraviolet backscatter could be used as a method to measure atmospheric ozone profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singer|first1=S.

===1953: University of Maryland===
Singer moved back to the United States in 1953, where he took up an associate professorship in physics at the University of Maryland, and at the same time served as the director of the Center for Atmospheric and Space Physics. Scheuering writes that his work involved conducting experiments on rockets and satellites, remote sensing, [[radiation belts]], the [[magnetosphere]], and [[meteorites]]. He developed a new method of launching rockets into space: firing them from a high-flying plane, both with and without a pilot. The Navy adopted the idea and Singer supervised the project. He received a White House Special Commendation from [[President Eisenhower]] in 1954 for his work.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;

He became one of 12 board members of the [[American Astronautical Society]], an organization formed in 1954 to represent the country's 300 leading scientists and engineers in the area of guided missiles—he was one of seven members of the board to resign in December 1956 after a series of disputes about the direction and control of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Schumach, Murray. [https://www.nytimes.com/1956/12/03/archives/planet-scientists-collide-break-up-7-of-12-astronautical-society.html?sq=%2522fred%2520singer%2522&amp;scp=88&amp;st=cse "Planet Scientists Collide, Break Up"], ''The New York Times'', December 3, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1957 Singer and other scientists at the university successfully designed and fired three new "Oriole" rockets off the Virginia Capes. The rockets weighed less than {{convert|25|lb}} and could be built for around $2000. Fired from a converted Navy [[Landing Ship Medium|LSM]], they could reach an altitude of {{convert|50000|ft|m}} and had a complete telemetry system to send back information on cosmic, ultraviolet and X-rays. Singer said that the firings placed "the exploration of outer space with high altitude rockets on the same basis, cost-wise and effort-wise, as low atmosphere measurements with weather balloons. From now on, we can fire thousands of these rockets all over the world with very little cost."&lt;ref&gt;"Maryland U. Fires Three New Rockets," ''The Washington Post'', November 8, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1958, when he was head of the cosmic ray group of the University of Maryland's physics department, he was congratulated in a telegram to the president of the university from President Eisenhower for his work in satellite research.&lt;ref&gt;"President Lauds Physicist Singer," ''The Washington Post'', February 4, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1958, he was appointed as a consultant to the House Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration, which was preparing to hold hearings on President Eisenhower's proposal for a new agency to handle space research, and a month later received the Ohio State University's Distinguished Alumnus Award.&lt;ref&gt;"Singer Appointed Space Consultant," ''The Washington Post'', April 6, 1958.

Physicist Receives Award," ''The Washington Post'', May 3, 1958: the reward was for his "widely recognized research contributions in the fields of cosmic rays, upper atmosphere and space flight, and for the recognition he has brought to university and government research organizations through his outstanding and prolific work."&lt;/ref&gt; He became a full professor at Maryland in 1959, and was chosen that year by the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce as one of the country's [[Ten Outstanding Young Americans|ten outstanding young men]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sepp.org/about%20sepp/bios/singer/cvsfs.html S.

In a January 1960 presentation to the American Physical Society, Singer sketched out his vision of what the environment around the earth might consist of, extending up to {{convert|40000|mi|km}} into space.&lt;ref&gt;Osmundsen, John A. [https://www.nytimes.com/1960/01/30/archives/scientist-looks-40000-miles-out-believes-the-earth-may-have-two.html?sq=%2522fred%2520singer%2522&amp;scp=21&amp;st=cse "Scientist 'looks' 40,000 miles out"], ''The New York Times'', January 30, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; He became known for his early predictions about the properties of the electrical particles trapped around the earth, which were partly verified by later discoveries in satellite experiments. In December 1960, he suggested the existence of a shell of visible dust particles around the earth some 600 to {{convert|1000|mi|km}} in space, beyond which there was a layer of smaller particles, a micrometre or less in diameter, extending 2,000 to {{convert|4000|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, Robert K.

J. Opik]], were given a $97,000 grant by NASA to conduct a three-year study of interplanetary gas and dust.&lt;ref&gt;"M.U. Professors get NASA grants," Associated Press, March 22, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960: Artificial Phobos hypothesis===
In a 1960 ''Astronautics'' newsletter, Singer commented on [[Iosif Shklovsky]]'s hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;I. S. Shklovsky, ''The Universe, Life, and Mind'', Academy of Sciences USSR, Moscow, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iosif S. Shklovski and Carl Sagan. ''Intelligent Life in the Universe'', San Francisco: Holden-Day, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; that the orbit of the [[Mars|Martian]] moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] suggests that it is hollow, which implies it is of artificial origin. Singer wrote: "My conclusion there is, and here I back Shklovsky, that if the satellite is indeed spiraling inward as deduced from astronomical observation, then there is little alternative to the hypothesis that it is hollow and therefore martian made. The big 'if' lies in the astronomical observations; they may well be in error. Since they are based on several independent sets of measurements taken decades apart by different observers with different instruments, systematic errors may have influenced them."&lt;ref&gt;S. F. Singer, "More on the Moons of Mars", ''Astronautics'', February 1960, American Astronautical Society, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Later measurements confirmed Singer's ''big "if"'' caveat: Shklovsky overestimated Phobos' rate of altitude loss due to bad early data.&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Öpik,  "News and Comments: Phobos, Nature of Acceleration". Irish Astronomical Journal 6: 40, March 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs by probes beginning in 1972 show a natural stony surface with craters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/missions/past/mariner89/ Mars Exploration Program: Mariner 8 &amp; 9]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ufology|Ufologists]] continue to present Singer as an unconditional supporter of Shklovsky's artificial Phobos hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sema4.com.au/an/211-AN.pdf |title=Andrew Kelleher, "Phobos: the odd moon of Mars", in Alienation News #211 Nov 2002. |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040902064151/http://www.sema4.com.au/an/211-AN.pdf |archivedate=2004-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine wrote in 1969 that Singer had had a lifelong fascination with Phobos and Mars's second moon, [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. He told ''Time'' it might be possible to pull Deimos into the Earth's orbit so it could be examined.&lt;ref name=Time1969/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=gL9scSG3K_gC&amp;dat=19690127&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en "Scientist Urges U.S. Seizure of a Martian Moon"], ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', January 27, 1969, p2&lt;/ref&gt;  During an international space symposium in May 1966, attended by space scientists from the United States and Soviet Union, he first proposed that manned [[Phobos (moon)#Future missions|landings on the Martian moons]] would be a logical step after a manned landing on the Earth's moon. He pointed out that the very small sizes of Phobos and Deimos—approximately {{convert|14|mi|km}} and {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} in diameter and sub milli-[[g-force|g]] surface gravity—would make it easier for a spacecraft to land and take off again.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Walter.

===1962: National Weather Center and University of Miami===
In 1962, on leave from the university, Singer was named as the first director of meteorological satellite services for the National Weather Satellite Center, now part of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], and directed a program for using satellites to forecast the weather.&lt;ref name=NYTJuly1962&gt;''The New York Times''.

He told ''Time'' magazine in 1969 that he enjoyed moving around. "Each move gave me a completely new perspective," he said. "If I had sat still, I'd probably still be measuring [[cosmic rays]], the subject of my thesis at Princeton. That's what happens to most scientists."&lt;ref name=Time1969&gt;''Time'' magazine.

===1967: Department of Interior and EPA===
In 1967 he accepted the position of deputy assistant secretary with the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]], where he was in charge of water quality and research. When the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] was created on 1970, he became its deputy assistant administrator of policy.

===1971–1994 University of Virginia===
Singer accepted a professorship in Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia in 1971, a position he held until 1994, where he taught classes on environmental issues such as ozone depletion, acid rain, climate change, population growth, and public policy issues related to oil and energy.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In 1987 he took up a two-year post as chief scientist at the Department of Transportation, and in 1989 joined the Institute of Space Science and Technology in Gainesville, Florida where he contributed to a paper on the results from the Interplanetary Dust Experiment using data from the [[Long Duration Exposure Facility]] satellite.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiedl.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PSISDG002214000001000076000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes Long duration exposure facility (LDEF) interplanetary dust experiment (IDE) impact detector results]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; When he retired from Virginia in 1994, he became Distinguished Research Professor at the Institute for Humane Studies at George Mason University until 2000.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;[http://www.sepp.org/about%20sepp/bios/singer/cvsfs.html S.

==Public debates==

===Writing===
Throughout his academic career Singer has written frequently in the mainstream press, including ''The New York Times'', ''The Washington Post'', and ''Wall Street Journal'', often striking up positions disputing mainstream thinking. His overall position is one of distrust of federal regulations and a strong belief in the efficacy of the [[free market]]. He believes in what Rachel White Scheuering calls "free market environmentalism": that market principles and incentives should be sufficient to lead to the protection of the environment and conservation of resources.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt; Regular themes in his articles have been energy, oil embargoes, [[OPEC]], [[Iran]], and rising prices. Throughout the 1970s, for example, he downplayed the idea of an [[1970s energy crisis|energy crisis]] and said it was largely a media event.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sepp.org/about%20sepp/bios/singer/cvsfs.html "S. Fred Singer Ph.D."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928135220/http://www.sepp.org/about%20sepp/bios/singer/cvsfs.html |date=2006-09-28 }}, Scientific &amp; Environmental Protection Project, accessed May 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In several papers in the 1990s and 2000s he struck up other positions against the mainstream, questioning the link between [[UV-B]] and [[melanoma]] rates, and that between [[Haloalkane#Chlorofluoro compounds (CFC, HCFC, HFC)|CFCs]] and stratospheric ozone loss.&lt;ref name="Ozone, Skin Cancer, and the SST"/&gt;

In October 1967, Singer wrote an article for ''The Washington Post'' from the perspective of 2007. His predictions included that planets had been explored but not colonized, and although rockets had become more powerful they had not replaced aircraft and ramjet vehicles. None of the fundamental laws of physics had been overturned. There was increased reliance on the electronic computer and data processor; the most exciting development was the increase in human intellect by direct electronic storage of information in the brain—the coupling of the brain to an external computer, thereby gaining direct access to an information library.&lt;ref name=SingerOct1967&gt;Singer, S. Fred. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/185635742.html?FMT=AI&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Oct+1%2C+1967&amp;author=By+S.+Fred+Singer&amp;desc=Looking+Back+From+A.D.+2007 "Looking Back From A.D. 2007"], ''The Washington Post'', October 1, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

He debated the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] on ABC's ''Nightline'', Sagan arguing that, if enough fire-fighting teams were not assembled in short order, and if many fires were left to burn over a period of months to possibly a year, the smoke might loft into the [[upper atmosphere]] and lead to massive agricultural failures over South Asia. Singer argued that it would rise to {{convert|3000|ft|m}} then be rained out after a few days.&lt;ref&gt;"First Israeli scud fatalities oil fires in Kuwait", ''Nightline'', ABC News, January 22, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, both Sagan and Singer were incorrect; smoke plumes from the oil fires rose to 10,000&amp;ndash;12,000 feet and lingered for nearly a month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/owf_ii_s04.htm#IV.%20AIR%20POLLUTANTS%20FROM%20OIL%20FIRES%20AND%20OTHER%20SOURCES | title = Environmental Exposure Report: Oil Well Fires | publisher = U.S. Department of Defense | date = 2 August 2000 | accessdate = 15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but despite absorbing 75&amp;ndash;80% of the sun's radiation in the Persian Gulf area the plumes had little global effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hobbs PV, Radke LF |title=Airborne studies of the smoke from the kuwait oil fires |journal=Science |volume=256 |issue=5059 |pages=987–91 | date=May 1992 |pmid=17795001 |doi=10.1126/science.256.5059.987 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17795001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public debates in which Singer has received most criticism have been about [[second-hand smoke]] and global warming. He has questioned the link between second-hand smoke and [[lung cancer]], and has been an outspoken opponent of the mainstream scientific view on [[climate change]]; he argues there is no evidence that increases in [[carbon dioxide]] produced by human beings is causing [[global warming]] and that the temperature of the earth has always varied.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; A CBC ''Fifth Estate'' documentary in 2006 linked these two debates, naming Singer as a scientist who has acted as a consultant to industry in both areas, either directly or through a public relations firm.&lt;ref name=CBCsmoking/&gt; [[Naomi Oreskes]] and [[Erik M. Conway|Erik Conway]] named Singer in their book, ''[[Merchants of Doubt]]'', as one of three contrarian physicists&amp;mdash;along with [[Fred Seitz]] and [[William Nierenberg|Bill Nierenberg]]&amp;mdash;who regularly injected themselves into the public debate about contentious scientific issues, positioning themselves as skeptics, their views gaining traction because the media gives them equal time out of a sense of fairness.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Seth.

===Second-hand smoke===
According to [[David Biello]] and [[John Pavlus]] in ''[[Scientific American]]'', Singer is best known for his denial of the health risks of [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;Biello, David and Pavlus, John.

Singer told [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s ''The Fifth Estate'' in 2006 that he stood by the position that the EPA had "cooked the data" to show that [[second-hand smoke]] causes lung cancer. CBC said that tobacco money had paid for Singer's research and for his promotion of it, and that it was organized by [[APCO Worldwide#The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition controversy|APCO]]. Singer told CBC it made no difference where the money came from. "They don't carry a note on a dollar bill saying 'This comes from the tobacco industry,'" he said. "In any case I was not aware of it, and I didn't ask APCO where they get their money. That's not my business."&lt;ref name=CBCsmoking /&gt; In December 2010 he wrote in ''[[American Thinker]]'' that he is nonsmoker who finds [[second-hand smoke]] an unpleasant irritant that cannot be healthy; he also wrote that his father, a heavy smoker, died of [[emphysema]] when relatively young. According to Singer, he serves on the advisory board of an anti-smoking organization, and has never been paid by [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] or the [[Tobacco politics|tobacco lobby]].&lt;ref&gt;Singer, S.

===Global warming===
In a 2003 letter to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', Singer wrote that "there is no convincing evidence that the global climate is actually warming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Climate concern is just a tax ruse |last=Singer, |first=S. |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |location=[[London]] |date=November 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the CBC's ''Fifth Estate'' named Singer as one of [[List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming|a small group of scientists]] who have created what the documentary called a stand-off that is undermining the political response to global warming.&lt;ref name=CBCsmoking /&gt; The following year he appeared on the British Channel 4 documentary ''[[The Great Global Warming Swindle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Owen and Adam, David. [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/22/channel4.ofcom "Watchdog's verdict on Channel 4 climate film angers scientists"], ''The Guardian'', July 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Singer argues there is no evidence that the increases in carbon dioxide produced by humans cause global warming, and that if temperatures do rise it will be good for humankind. He told CBC: "It was warmer a thousand years ago than it is today. Vikings settled Greenland. Is that good or bad? I think it's good. They grew wine in England, in northern England. I think that's good. At least some people think so."&lt;ref&gt;"The Denial Machine," 20:10 mins.&lt;/ref&gt; "We are certainly putting more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere," he told ''The Daily Telegraph'' in 2009. "However there is no evidence that this high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is making a detectable difference. It should in principle, however the atmosphere is very complicated and one cannot simply argue that just because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a greenhouse gas it causes warming."&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; He believes that radical environmentalists are exaggerating the dangers. "The underlying effort here seems to be to use global warming as an excuse to cut down the use of energy," he said. "It's very simple: if you cut back the use of energy, then you cut back economic growth. And believe it or not, there are people in the world who believe we have gone too far in economic growth."&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;

====SEPP and funding====
In 1990 Singer set up the [[Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project]] (SEPP) to argue against preventive measures against global warming. After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt; He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950–1980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''—with the headline that day "Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science"—that climate models are faulty. In 2007 he collaborated on a study that found tropospheric temperature trends of "Climate of the 20th Century" models differed from satellite observations by twice the model mean uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, David H.; Christy, John R.; Pearson, Benjamin D.; Singer, S. Fred. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117857349/abstract "A comparison of tropical temperature trends with model predictions"], ''International Journal of Climatology'', 28: 1693, December 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel White Scheuering writes that, when SEPP began, it was affiliated with the [[Washington Institute for Values in Public Policy]], a think tank founded by [[Unification Church]] leader [[Sun Myung Moon]].&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt; A 1990 article for the [[Cato Institute]] identifies Singer as the director of the science and environmental policy project at the Washington Institute for Values in Public Policy, on leave from the University of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, S.

Singer has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Scheuering argues that his conclusions concur with the economic interests of the companies that pay him, in that the companies want to see a reduction in environmental regulation.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;

In August 2007 ''Newsweek'' reported that in April 1998 a dozen people from what it called "the denial machine" met at the [[American Petroleum Institute]]'s Washington headquarters. The meeting included Singer's group, the [[George C. Marshall Institute]], and ExxonMobil. Newsweek said that, according to an eight-page memo that was leaked, the meeting proposed a $5-million campaign to convince the public that the science of global warming was controversial and uncertain. The plan was leaked to the press and never implemented.&lt;ref name=Begley&gt;Begley, Sharon. [http://www.newsweek.com/id/32482/page/3 "The Truth About Denial"], ''Newsweek'', August 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The week after the story, ''Newsweek'' published a contrary view from [[Robert Samuelson]], one of its columnists, who said the story of an industry-funded denial machine was contrived and fundamentally misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, Robert. [http://www.newsweek.com/id/32312 "Greenhouse Simplicities"], ''Newsweek'', August 20–27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ABC News reported in March 2008 that Singer said he is not on the payroll of the energy industry, but he acknowledged that SEPP had received one unsolicited charitable donation of $10,000 from ExxonMobil, and that it was one percent of all donations received. Singer said that his connection to Exxon was more like being on their mailing list than holding a paid position.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;Harris, Dan et al.

Congresswoman Lynn Rivers questioned Singer's credibility during a congressional hearing in 1995, saying he had not been able to publish anything in a peer-reviewed scientific journal for the previous 15 years, except for one technical comment.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Michaels|first=P.

====Criticism of the IPCC====
{{Main article|Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC)}}
In 1995 the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) issued [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|a report]] reflecting the scientific consensus that the balance of evidence suggests there is a discernible human influence on global climate. Singer responded with a letter to ''Science'' saying the IPCC report had presented material selectively. He wrote: "the Summary does not even mention the existence of 18 years of weather satellite data that show a slight global cooling trend, contradicting all theoretical models of climate warming."&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Fred. [http://www.sepp.org/Archive/controv/ipcccont/Item07.htm "Letter to Science: Changes in the Climate Change Report"], Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project, July 3, 1996, accessed October 30, 2010. [https://www.webcitation.org/5trPqlvPc?url=http://www.sepp.org/Archive/controv/ipcccont/Item07.htm Archived] on October 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Scheuering writes that Singer acknowledges the surface thermometers from weather stations show warming, but he argues that the satellites provide better data because their measurements cover pole to pole.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;
According to Edward Parson and [[Andrew Dessler]], the satellite data did not show surface temperatures directly, but had to be adjusted using models. When adjustment was made for transient events the data showed a slight warming, and research suggested that the discrepancy between surface and satellite data was largely accounted for by problems such as instrument differences between satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Parson, Edward A., and Dessler, Andrew E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pvq4-5EdkW8C&amp;pg=PA35 ''The Science and Politics of Global Climate Change: A Guide to the Debate'']. Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer wrote the "[[Leipzig Declaration|Leipzig Declaration on Global Climate Change in the U.S.]]" in 1995, updating it in 1997 to rebut the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. The Kyoto Protocol was the result of an international convention held in Kyoto, Japan, during which several industrialized nations agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Singer's declaration read: "Energy is essential for economic growth ... We understand the motivation to eliminate what are perceived to be the driving forces behind a potential climate change; but we believe the Kyoto Protocol—to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only a part of the world community—is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living."&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;

Scheuering writes that Singer circulated this in the United States and Europe and gathered 100 signatories, though she says some of the signatories' credentials were questioned. At least 20 were television weather reporters, some did not have science degrees, and 14 were listed as professors without specifying a field. According to Scheuering, some of them later said they believed they were signing a document in favour of action against climate change.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;

{{anchor|NIPCC}}Singer set up the '''Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change''' (NIPCC) after a 2004 United Nations climate conference in Milan. NIPCC organized an international climate workshop in Vienna in April 2007,&lt;ref name=nature1/&gt; to provide what they called an independent examination of the evidence for climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harriette and Bast, Joseph L. [http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=23062 "Climate Change Conference Invigorates Global Warming Debate"], ''Environment News'', The Heartland Institute, May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Singer prepared an NIPCC report called "Nature, Not Human Activity, Rules the Climate," published in March 2008 by [[The Heartland Institute]], a conservative think tank.&lt;ref name=nature1&gt;Singer, S. Fred (ed.). [http://www.heartland.org/article.cfm?artId=22835 "Nature, Not Human Activity, Rules the Climate"], Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, March 2, 2008, accessed May 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ABC News said the same month that unnamed climate scientists from NASA, Stanford, and Princeton who spoke to ABC about the report dismissed it as "fabricated nonsense". In a letter of complaint to ABC News, Singer said their piece used "prejudicial language, distorted facts, libelous insinuations, and anonymous smears".&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

On September 18, 2013, the NIPCC's fourth report, entitled ''Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science,'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://heartland.org/media-library/pdfs/CCR-II/Summary-for-Policymakers.pdf | title=Summary for Policymakers | publisher=[[The Heartland Institute]] | date=September 2013 | accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with previous NIPCC reports, environmentalists criticized it upon its publication; for example, [[David Suzuki]] wrote that it was "full of long-discredited claims, including that carbon dioxide emissions are good because they stimulate life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/david-suzuki/climate-change-deniers_b_3984750.html | title=Climate Change Deniers Don't Deserve an Equal Voice | work=[[Huffington Post]] | date=25 September 2013 | accessdate=14 March 2014 | author=Suzuki, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the report received favorable coverage from [[Fox News Channel]]'s [[Doug McKelway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/19/new-study-says-threat-global-warming-greatly-exaggerated/ | title=New study says threat of man-made global warming greatly exaggerated | work=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=19 September 2013 | accessdate=16 March 2014 | author=McKelway, Doug}}&lt;/ref&gt; climate scientists [[Kevin Trenberth]] and [[Michael Oppenheimer]] criticized this coverage, with Trenberth calling it "irresponsible journalism" and Oppenheimer calling it "flat out wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/09/18/fox-equates-faux-un-climate-report-with-the-rea/195947 | title=Fox Equates Faux UN Climate Report With The Real Thing | work=[[Media Matters for America]] | date=18 September 2013 | accessdate=16 March 2014 | author=McKelway, Doug}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climategate====
In December 2009, after the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]], Singer wrote an opinion piece for Reuters in which he said the scientists had misused [[peer review]], pressured editors to prevent publication of alternative views, and smeared opponents. He said the leaked e-mails showed that the "surface temperature data that [[IPCC]] relies on is based on distorted raw data and [[algorithm]]s that they will not share with the science community." He argued that the incident exposed a flawed process, and that the temperature trends were heading downwards even as [[greenhouse gas]]es like [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] were increasing in the [[atmosphere]]. He wrote: "This negative correlation contradicts the results of the models that IPCC relies on and indicates that [[anthropogenic global warming]] (AGW) is quite small," concluding "and now it turns out that global warming might have been 'man made' after all."&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Fred S. [http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2009/12/14/climate-skeptic-we-are-winning-the-science-battle/ "Climate skeptic: We are winning the science battle"], Reuters, December 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[British House of Commons]] [[Science and Technology Select Committee]] later issued a report that exonerated the scientists,&lt;ref&gt;Gillis, Justin. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/08/science/earth/08climate.html "British Panel Clears Climate Scientists"], ''The New York Times'', July 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GenoCAD''' is one of the earliest [[computer assisted design]] tools for [[synthetic biology]].&lt;ref name="High-level"/&gt; The software is a bioinformatics tool developed and maintained by [http://www.genofab.com GenoFAB]. GenoCAD facilitates the design of protein expression vectors, artificial gene networks and other genetic constructs for [[genetic engineering]] and is based on the theory of [[formal languages]].&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt; GenoCAD can be used online at [http://www.genocad.com www.genocad.com].

==History==
GenoCAD originated as an offshoot of an attempt to formalize functional constraints of genetic constructs using the theory of [[formal languages]]. In 2007, the website genocad.org (now retired) was set up as a proof of concept by researchers at [[Virginia Bioinformatics Institute]], [[Virginia Tech]]. Using the website, users could design genes by repeatedly replacing high-level genetic constructs with lower level genetic constructs, and eventually with actual [[DNA]] sequences.&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt;

On August 31, 2009, the [[National Science Foundation]] granted a three-year $1,421,725 grant to Dr. Jean Peccoud, an associate professor at the [[Virginia Bioinformatics Institute]] at [[Virginia Tech]], for the development of GenoCAD.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; GenoCAD was and continues to be developed by GenoFAB, a company founded by Peccoud (currently [[Chief science officer|CSO]] and acting [[CEO]]), who was also one of the authors of the originating study.&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt;

Source code for GenoCAD was originally released on [[Sourceforge]] in December 2009.&lt;ref name=commit&gt;{{cite web|title=GenoCAD Code|url=http://sourceforge.net/p/genocad/code/commit_browser|work=Sourceforge|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GenoCAD version 2.0 was released in November 2011 and included the ability to simulate the behavior of the designed genetic code. This feature was a result of a collaboration with the team behind [[COPASI]].&lt;ref name="release notes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Mandy |title=GenoCAD Release Notes |url=http://peccoud.vbi.vt.edu/genocad-release-notes/ |work=Peccoud Lab |accessdate=8 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013161353/http://peccoud.vbi.vt.edu/genocad-release-notes/ |archivedate=13 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2015, Peccoud and colleagues published a library of biological parts, called GenoLIB, that can be incorporated into the GenoCAD platform.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GenoCAD workflow.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Workflow of GenoCAD]]
 
* '''Management of genetic sequences''': The purpose of this group of features is to help users identify, within large collections of genetic parts, the parts needed for a project and to organize them in project-specific libraries.
** ''Genetic parts'': Parts have a unique identifier, a name and a more general description. They also have a [[DNA sequence]]. Parts are associated with a [[formal grammar|grammar]] and assigned to a parts category such a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], [[gene]], etc.
** ''Parts libraries'': Collections of parts are organized in libraries. In some cases part libraries correspond to parts imported from a single source such as another [[sequence database]]. In other cases, libraries correspond to the parts used for a particular design project. Parts can be moved from one library to another through a temporary storage area called the cart (analogous to e-commerce shopping carts).
** ''Searching parts'': Users can search the parts database using the [[Lucene]] search engine. Basic and advanced search modes are available. Users can develop complex queries and save them for future reuse.
** ''Importing/Exporting parts'': Parts can be imported and exported individually or as entire libraries using standard file formats (e.g., [[tab delimited]], [[FASTA]], [[SBML]]).
* '''Combining sequences into genetic constructs''': The purpose of this group of features is to streamline the process of combining genetic parts into designs compliant with a specific design strategy.
** ''Point-and-click design tool'': This [[Wizard (software)|wizard]] guides the user through a series of design decisions that determine the design structure and the selection of parts included in the design.
** ''Design management'': Designs can be saved in the user [[workspace]]. Design statuses are regularly updated to warn users of the consequences of editing parts on previously saved designs.
** ''Exporting designs'': Designs can be exported using standard file formats (e.g., [[GenBank]], [[tab delimited]], [[FASTA]]).
** ''Design safety'': Designs are protected from some types of errors by forcing the user to follow the appropriate design strategy. 
** ''Simulation'': Sequences designed in GenoCAD can be simulated to display chemical production in the resulting cell.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cai | first1 = Y. | last2 = Lux | first2 = M.

* '''User workspace''': Users can personalize their [[workspace]] by adding parts to the GenoCAD database, creating specialized libraries corresponding to specific design projects, and saving designs at different stages of development.

==Theoretical foundation==
GenoCAD is rooted in the theory of [[formal languages]]; in particular, the design rules describing how to combine different kinds of parts and form [[context-free grammar]]s.
&lt;ref name="orig"&gt;
{{cite journal

|pmc=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A context free grammar can be defined by its terminals, variables, start variable and substitution rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Third edition|year=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=978-1-133-18779-0|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In GenoCAD, the terminals of the grammar are sequences of [[DNA]] that perform a particular biological purpose (e.g. a [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]]). The variables are less homogeneous: they can represent longer sequences that have multiple functions or can represent a section of DNA that can contain one of multiple different sequences of DNA but perform the same function (e.g. a variable represents the set of promoters). GenoCAD includes built in substitution rules to ensure that the DNA sequence is biologically viable. Users can also define their own sets of rules for other purposes.

Designing a sequence of DNA in GenoCAD is much like creating a derivation in a context free grammar. The user starts with the start variable and repeatedly selects a variable and a substitution for it until only terminals are left.&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt;

{{distinguish|Haldane's principle}}
[[File:Human male karyotpe high resolution - XY chromosome cropped.JPG|thumb|In humans, barring intersex conditions and other unusual states, it is the male that is [[heterogametic]], with XY sex chromosomes.]]
'''Haldane's rule''' is an observation about the early stage of [[speciation]], formulated in 1922 by the British [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[J.B.S. Haldane]], that states that if in a [[species]] [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] only one sex is inviable or [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]], that sex is more likely to be the [[heterogametic sex]]. The heterogametic sex is the one with two different [[sex chromosome]]s; in [[theria|therian mammals]],{{refn|group=note|Monotremes have more than two. The [[platypus]] has five pairs, as do female [[echidna]]s. Male echidnas have nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deakin |first1=J.E. |last2=Graves |first2=J.A.M. |last3=Rens |first3=W. |title=The Evolution of Marsupial and Monotreme Chromosomes |journal=Cytogenetic and Genome Research |volume=137 |issue=2–4 |year=2012 |pages=113–129 |doi=10.1159/000339433}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} for example, this is the male.&lt;ref name="genetics"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Dominance Theory of Haldane's Rule|author=Turelli, M; Orr, H.A. |journal=[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]] |date=May 1995 |volume=140 |issue=1 |pp=389–402 |pmc=1206564 |pmid=7635302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Haldane himself described the rule as:
{{quote|When in the [[F1 hybrid|F1]] offspring of two different animal races one sex is absent, rare, or sterile, that sex is the heterozygous sex (heterogametic sex).&lt;ref name=Haldane1922&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1007/BF02983075| last1=Haldane| first1=J.

Haldane's rule applies to the vast majority of heterogametic organisms. This includes the case where two species make secondary contact in an area of [[sympatry]] and form hybrids after [[allopatric speciation]] has occurred.

The rule includes both male heterogametic ([[XY sex-determination system|XY]] or [[XO sex-determination system|XO-type sex determination]], such as found in [[mammal]]s and ''[[Drosophila]]'' fruit flies) and female heterogametic ([[ZW sex-determination system|ZW-type sex determination]], as found in [[birds]] and [[butterflies]]), and some [[Dioecy|dioecious]] plants such as [[Silene|campions]].&lt;ref name="Brothers2010"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01095.x| last1=Brothers| first1=Amanda N.| last2=Delph| first2=Lynda F.| year=2010| title=Haldane's rule is extended to plants with sex chromosomes| journal=Evolution| volume=64| issue=12| pages=3643–3648 | pmid=20681984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid dysfunction (sterility and inviability) is a major form of post-[[zygote|zygotic]] reproductive isolation, which occurs in early stages of speciation. Evolution can produce a similar pattern of isolation in a vast array of different organisms. However, the actual mechanisms leading to Haldane's rule in different taxa remain largely undefined.

==Hypotheses==
Many different hypotheses have been advanced to address the evolutionary mechanisms to produce Haldane's rule. Currently, the most popular explanation for Haldane's rule is the composite hypothesis, which divides Haldane's rule into multiple subdivisions, including sterility, inviability, male heterogamety, and female heterogamety. The composite hypothesis states that Haldane's rule in different subdivisions has different causes. Individual genetic mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive, and these mechanisms may act together to cause Haldane's rule in any given subdivision.&lt;ref name=Orrl1993&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Orr | first1=H. A. | year=1993 | title=Haldane's rule has multiple genetic causes | journal=Nature | volume=361 | issue=6412 | pages=532–533 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v361/n6412/pdf/361532a0.pdf | doi=10.1038/361532a0 | pmid=8429905}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wul1993&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wu | first1=C.-I. | last2=Davis | first2=A. W. | year=1993 | title=Evolution of postmating reproductive isolation: the composite nature of Haldane's rule and its genetic bases | journal=The American Naturalist | volume=142 | issue=22 | pages=187–212 | jstor=2462812 | doi= 10.1086/285534 | pmid=19425975}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to these views that emphasise genetic mechanisms, another view hypothesizes that population dynamics during population divergence may cause Haldane's rule.&lt;ref name=Wangl2003&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wang | first1=R. | year=2003 | title=Differential strength of sex-biased hybrid inferiority in impeding gene flow may be a cause of Haldane's rule | journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume=16 | pmid=14635874 | issue=2 | pages=353–361 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1420-9101.2003.00528.x/pdf | doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2003.00528.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main genetic hypotheses are:

* Dominance: Heterogametic hybrids are affected by all X-linked alleles (be they recessive or dominant) causing incompatibilities due to divergent alleles being brought together. However, homogametic hybrids are only affected by dominant deleterious X-linked alleles. Heterogametic hybrids, which carry only a single copy of a given [[X-linked]] gene, will be affected by mutations regardless of dominance. Thus, an X-linked incompatibility between diverging populations is more likely to be expressed in the heterogametic sex than in the homogametic sex.
* The "faster male": Male genes are thought to evolve faster due to [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name=Wul1993 /&gt; As a result, male sterility becomes more evident in male heterogametic taxa (XY sex determination). This hypothesis conflicts with Haldane's rule in male homogametic taxa, in which females are more affected by hybrid inferiority. It therefore only applies to male sterility in taxa with XY sex determination, according to the composite theory.
* [[Meiotic drive]]: In hybrid populations, selfish genetic elements inactivate sperm cells (i.e.: an X-linked drive factor inactivates a Y-bearing sperm and vice versa).
* The "faster X": Genes on hemizygous chromosomes may evolve more quickly by enhancing selection on possible recessive alleles causing a larger effect in reproductive isolation.&lt;ref name=Charlesworth1987&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Charlesworth | first1=B. | last2=Coyne | first2=J. A. | last3=Barton | first3=N. H. | year=1987 | title=The relative rates of evolution of sex chromosomes and autosomes | journal=The American Naturalist | volume=130 | issue=1 | pages=113–146 | jstor=10.2307/2461884 | doi=10.1086/284701}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Differential selection: Hybrid incompatibilities affecting the heterogametic sex and homogametic sex are fundamentally different isolating mechanisms, which makes heterogametic inferiority (sterility/inviability) more visible or preserved in nature.&lt;ref name="Wangl2003"/&gt;

Data from multiple phylogenetic groups support a combination of dominance and faster X-chromosome theories.&lt;ref name=Schilthuizen2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Schilthuizen | first1=M. | last2=Giesbers| first2= M. C.| last3=Beukeboom | first3= L. W.| year=2011| title=Haldane's rule in the 21st century| journal=Heredity| volume=107| pages=95–102| doi=10.1038/hdy.2010.170 | issue=2 | pmid=21224879 | pmc=3178397}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has recently been argued that dominance theory can not explain Haldane's rule in marsupials since both sexes experience the same incompatibilities due to paternal [[X-inactivation]] in females.&lt;ref name="Watson2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Watson | first1=E. | last2=Demuth | first2=J. | year=2012 | title=Haldane's rule in marsupials: what happens when both sexes are functionally hemizygous? | journal=Journal of Heredity | volume=103 | issue=3 | pages=453–458 | doi=10.1093/jhered/esr154 | pmid=22378959 | pmc=3331990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominance hypothesis is the core of the composite theory, and X-linked recessive/dominance effects have been demonstrated in many cases to cause hybrid incompatibilities. There is also supporting evidence for the faster male and meiotic drive hypotheses. For example, a significant reduction of male-driven gene flow is observed in [[Asian elephant]]s, suggesting faster evolution of male traits.&lt;ref name=Fickel2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fickel | first1=J. | last2=Lieckfeldt | first2= D. | last3=Ratanakorn | first3=P. | last4=Pitra | first4=C. | year=2007 | title=Distribution of haplotypes and microsatellite alleles among Asian elephants (''Elephas maximus'') in Thailand | journal=European Journal of Wildlife Research | volume=53 | issue=4 | pages=298–303 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/R0Q2143R8852824N.pdf | doi=10.1007/s10344-007-0099-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the rule was initially stated in context of [[diploid]] organisms with chromosomal [[Sex-determination system|sex determination]], it has recently been argued that it can be extended to certain species lacking chromosomal sex determination, such as [[haplodiploids]]&lt;ref name="Koevoets2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Koevoets | first1=T. | last2=Beukeboom | first2=L.

==Exceptions==
There are notable exceptions to Haldane's rule, where the homogametic sex turns out to be inviable while the heterogametic sex is viable and fertile.

The term is often used in discussing [[display device]]s, [[photography]], [[3D rendering]], and [[sound recording]] including [[digital imaging]] and [[digital audio]] production.

== Audio ==

[[XDR (audio)]] is used to provide higher-quality audio when using microphone sound systems or recording onto cassette tapes.

HDR Audio is a dynamic mixing technique used in [[EA Digital Illusions CE]] [[Frostbite Engine]] to allow relatively louder sounds to drown out softer sounds.

[[Dynamic range compression]] is a set of techniques used in audio recording and communication to put high-dynamic-range material through channels or media of lower dynamic range.  Optionally, dynamic range expansion is used to restore the original high dynamic range on playback.

==Radio==

In radio, high dynamic range is important especially when there are potentially interfering signals.  Measures such as [[spurious-free dynamic range]] are used to quantify the dynamic range of various system components such as frequency synthesizers.  HDR concepts are important in both conventional and [[software-defined radio]] design.

==Instrumentation==

In many fields, instruments need to have a very high dynamic range.  For example, in [[seismology]], HDR accelerometers are needed, as in the [[ICEARRAY#Instruments|ICEARRAY instruments]].

==Background==
With the sequencing of the genomes of a diverse array or model organisms, it became clear that the number of genes does not correlate with the human perception of relative organism complexity – the human [[proteome]] contains some 20 000 genes,&lt;ref name="pmid18474865"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amaral LA | title = A truer measure of our ignorance | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 19 | pages = 6795–6 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18474865 | pmc = 2383987 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0802459105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is smaller than some species such as corn. A statistical approach to calculating the number of [[Protein–protein interaction|interactions]] in humans gives an estimate of around 650 000, one order of magnitude bigger than [[Drosophila]] and 3 times larger than [[Caenorhabditis elegans|C.

[[Protein–protein interactions]] are only the raw material for networks. To form useful interactome [[database]]s and create integrated networks, other types of data that can be combined with protein–protein interactions include information on [[gene expression]] and co-expression, cellular co-localization of proteins (based on [[Förster resonance energy transfer|microscopy]]), genetic information, metabolic and [[Signal transduction|signalling pathways]], and more.&lt;ref name="pmid21150998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonetta L | title = Protein-protein interactions: Interactome under construction | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7325 | pages = 851–4 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21150998 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/468851a }}&lt;/ref&gt; The end goal of unravelling human protein interactomes is ultimately to understand mechanisms of disease and uncover previously unknown disease genes.

==Studying the human interactome==
Analysis of metabolic networks of proteins hearkens back to the 1940s, but it was not until the late 1990s and early 2000s that computational data-driven genomic analyses to predict functional context and networks of genetic associations appeared in earnest.&lt;ref name="pmid18474865"/&gt; Since then, the [[interactome]]s of many [[model organism]]s are considered to have been well characterized, notably the [[Yeast|Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] Interactome&lt;ref name="pmid18719252"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu H, Braun P, Yildirim MA, Lemmens I, Venkatesan K, Sahalie J, Hirozane-Kishikawa T, Gebreab F, Li N, Simonis N, Hao T, Rual JF, Dricot A, Vazquez A, Murray RR, Simon C, Tardivo L, Tam S, Svrzikapa N, Fan C, de Smet AS, Motyl A, Hudson ME, Park J, Xin X, Cusick ME, Moore T, Boone C, Snyder M, Roth FP, Barabási AL, Tavernier J, Hill DE, Vidal M | display-authors = 6 | title = High-quality binary protein interaction map of the yeast interactome network | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5898 | pages = 104–10 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18719252 | pmc = 2746753 | doi = 10.1126/science.1158684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Drosophila]] interactome.&lt;ref name="pmid14605208"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giot L, Bader JS, Brouwer C, Chaudhuri A, Kuang B, Li Y, Hao YL, Ooi CE, Godwin B, Vitols E, Vijayadamodar G, Pochart P, Machineni H, Welsh M, Kong Y, Zerhusen B, Malcolm R, Varrone Z, Collis A, Minto M, Burgess S, McDaniel L, Stimpson E, Spriggs F, Williams J, Neurath K, Ioime N, Agee M, Voss E, Furtak K, Renzulli R, Aanensen N, Carrolla S, Bickelhaupt E, Lazovatsky Y, DaSilva A, Zhong J, Stanyon CA, Finley RL, White KP, Braverman M, Jarvie T, Gold S, Leach M, Knight J, Shimkets RA, McKenna MP, Chant J, Rothberg JM | display-authors = 6 | title = A protein interaction map of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Science | volume = 302 | issue = 5651 | pages = 1727–36 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14605208 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.1090289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High throughput experimental approaches for discovering protein–protein interactions typically perform a version of the [[two-hybrid screening]] approach or [[tandem affinity purification]] followed by [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name="pmid16189514"/&gt; Information from experiments and literature curation are compiled into databases of protein interactions, such as DIP,&lt;ref name="pmid11752321"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xenarios I, Salwínski L, Duan XJ, Higney P, Kim SM, Eisenberg D | title = DIP, the Database of Interacting Proteins: a research tool for studying cellular networks of protein interactions | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 303–5 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11752321 | pmc = 99070 | doi = 10.1093/nar/30.1.303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[BioGRID]].&lt;ref name="pmid25428363"/&gt; A more recent effort, HINT-KB,&lt;ref name=hintkb/&gt; attempts to amalgamate most of the current PPI databases, but filtering systematically erroneous interactions as well as trying to correct for inherent sociological sampling biases in literature curated datasets.

In 2010, around 130 000 binary interactions in the interactome were described in the most popular databases, but many were verified with only one source.&lt;ref name="pmid21150998"/&gt; With the rapid development of high throughput methods, datasets still suffer from high rates of [[False positives and false negatives|false positives]] and low coverage of the interactome.

A recent resource paper (November 2014) &lt;ref name="pmid25416956"/&gt; attempts to provide a more comprehensive [[proteome]] level map of the human interactome. It found vast uncharted territory in the human interactome, and used diverse methods to build a new interactome map correcting for curation bias, including probing all pairwise combinations of 13 000 protein products for interaction using Yeast two hybrid and co-affinity purification, in a massive coordinated effort across research labs in Canada and the United States. However, this still represents confirmation of but a fraction of expected interactions – around 30 000 of high confidence. Despite the coordinated efforts of many, the human interactome is still very much a work in progress.&lt;ref name="pmid25416956"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20589078"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and Symptoms --&gt;
'''Hypothermia''' is reduced body temperature that happens when a body dissipates more heat than it absorbs. In humans, it is defined as a body [[core temperature]] below {{convert|35.0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Symptoms depend on the temperature.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; In mild hypothermia there is [[shivering]] and [[mental confusion]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; In moderate hypothermia shivering stops and confusion increases.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; In severe hypothermia, there may be [[#Paradoxical undressing|paradoxical undressing]], in which a person removes their clothing, as well as an increased risk of the [[cardiac arrest|heart stopping]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown DJ, Brugger H, Boyd J, Paal P | title = Accidental hypothermia | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 367 | issue = 20 | pages = 1930–8 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23150960 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1114208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause, mechanism and diagnosis --&gt;
Hypothermia has two main types of causes. It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold.&lt;ref name=Rosen2010/&gt; It may also occur from any condition that decreases heat production or increases heat loss.&lt;ref name=Rosen2010&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |page=1870 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly this includes [[alcohol intoxication]] but may also include [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]], and advanced age.&lt;ref name=Rosen2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; [[Human body temperature|Body temperature]] is usually maintained near a constant level of {{convert|36.5|–|37.5|C|F}} through [[thermoregulation]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Efforts to increase body temperature involve shivering, increased voluntary activity, and putting on warmer clothing.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robertson|first1=David|title=Primer on the autonomic nervous system|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier/AP|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780123865250|page=288|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FycmOkb-T1gC&amp;pg=PA288|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908151245/https://books.google.com/books?id=FycmOkb-T1gC&amp;pg=PA288|archive-date=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypothermia may be diagnosed based on either a person's symptoms in the presence of risk factors or by measuring a person's core temperature.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing, and physical activity.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; In those with moderate hypothermia, heating blankets and warmed [[intravenous fluid]]s are recommended.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; In severe hypothermia, [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] (ECMO) or [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] may be useful.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; In those without a [[pulse]], [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) is indicated along with the above measures.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Rewarming is typically continued until a person's temperature is greater than {{convert|32|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; If there is no improvement at this point or the blood potassium level is greater than 12&amp;nbsp;mmol/liter at any time, resuscitation may be discontinued.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and prognosis --&gt;
Hypothermia is the cause of at least 1,500 deaths a year in the United States.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; It is more common in older people and males.&lt;ref name=Brac2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bracker|first1=Mark|title=The 5-Minute Sports Medicine Consult|date=2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9781451148121|page=320|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LOm9enAxQ8C&amp;pg=PA320|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908151245/https://books.google.com/books?id=-LOm9enAxQ8C&amp;pg=PA320|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the lowest documented body temperatures from which someone with accidental hypothermia has survived is {{convert|13.0|C|F}} in a near-drowning of a 7-year-old girl in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarkable recovery of seven-year-old girl|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=4296666|accessdate=2 March 2015|date=Jan 17, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307183116/http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=4296666|archivedate=7 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survival after more than six hours of CPR has been described.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; For those for whom ECMO or bypass is used, survival is around 50%.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Deaths due to hypothermia have played an important role in many wars.&lt;ref name=Rosen2010/&gt; The term is from [[Greek language|Greek]] ὑπο, ''ypo'', meaning "under", and θερμία, ''thermía'', meaning "heat". The opposite of hypothermia is [[hyperthermia]], an increased body temperature due to failed thermoregulation.&lt;ref name=NC08/&gt;&lt;ref name=CC09/&gt;

Hypothermia is often defined as any body temperature below {{convert|35.0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=Rosen2006/&gt; With this method it is divided into degrees of severity based on the [[core temperature]].&lt;ref name="Rosen2006"/&gt;

Another classification system, the Swiss staging system, divides hypothermia based on the presenting symptoms which is preferred when it is not possible to determine an accurate core temperature.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

Other cold-related injuries that can be present either alone or in combination with hypothermia include:

*[[Chilblains]]: condition caused by repeated exposure of skin to temperatures just above freezing. The cold causes damage to small blood vessels in the skin. This damage is permanent and the redness and itching will return with additional exposure. The redness and itching typically occurs on cheeks, ears, fingers, and toes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/coldstress/coldrelatedillnesses.html|title=CDC - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic - Cold Stress - Cold Related Illnesses|date=2018-06-06|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[normal human body temperature]] is often stated as {{convert|36.5|–|37.5|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karakitsos D, Karabinis A | title = Hypothermia therapy after traumatic brain injury in children | journal = N.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms vary depending on the degree of hypothermia, and may be divided by the three stages of severity.  Infants with hypothermia may feel cold when touched, with bright red skin and an unusual lack of energy.&lt;ref name=webmd&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-hypothermia What Is Hypothermia?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116080023/http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-hypothermia |date=2014-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mild===
Symptoms of mild hypothermia may be vague,&lt;ref name=Care99/&gt; with sympathetic nervous system excitation (shivering, [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], [[tachypnea|fast respiratory rate]], and [[vasoconstriction|contraction of blood vessels]]).

===Moderate===
Low body temperature results in shivering becoming more violent. Muscle mis-coordination becomes apparent.&lt;ref name=sterba/&gt;&lt;ref name=francis&gt;{{cite journal |author=Francis, TJR |title=Immersion hypothermia |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=28 |issue=3 |year=1998 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5975 |accessdate=2008-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208181253/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5975 |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cheung&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheung SS, Montie DL, White MD, Behm D | title = Changes in manual dexterity following short-term hand and forearm immersion in 10 degrees C water | journal = Aviat Space Environ Med | volume = 74 | issue = 9 | pages = 990–3 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14503680 | doi =  | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2003/00000074/00000009/art00013 | accessdate = 2008-06-11 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629184715/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2003/00000074/00000009/art00013 | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Movements are slow and labored, accompanied by a stumbling pace and mild confusion, although the person may appear alert. Surface blood vessels contract further as the body focuses its remaining resources on keeping the vital organs warm. The subject becomes pale. Lips, ears, fingers, and toes may become blue.

===Severe===
As the temperature decreases, further physiological systems falter and [[heart rate]], [[respiratory rate]], and [[blood pressure]] all decrease. This results in an expected heart rate in the 30s at a temperature of {{convert|28|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="Marx 2010 p.1869" /&gt;

Difficulty speaking, sluggish thinking, and [[amnesia]] start to appear; inability to use hands and stumbling are also usually present. Cellular metabolic processes shut down. Below {{convert|30|C|F}}, the exposed skin becomes blue and puffy, muscle coordination very poor, and walking almost impossible, and the person exhibits incoherent or irrational behavior, including terminal burrowing (see below) or even [[stupor]]. Pulse and [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] rates decrease significantly, but fast heart rates (ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation) can also occur. Atrial fibrillation is not typically a concern in and of itself.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Major [[Organ failure|organs fail]] and [[clinical death]] occurs.

=== Paradoxical undressing ===
Twenty to fifty percent of hypothermia deaths are associated with paradoxical undressing. This typically occurs during moderate and severe hypothermia, as the person becomes disoriented, confused, and combative. They may begin discarding their clothing, which, in turn, increases the rate of heat loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The word: Paradoxical undressing – being-human |year=2007 |author=New Scientist |journal=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19426002.600-the-word-paradoxical-undressing.html |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209024834/http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19426002.600-the-word-paradoxical-undressing.html |archivedate=2008-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid541627"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wedin B, Vanggaard L, Hirvonen J | title = "Paradoxical undressing" in fatal hypothermia | journal = J.

Rescuers who are trained in mountain survival techniques are taught to expect this; however, people who die from hypothermia in urban environments are sometimes incorrectly assumed to have been subjected to sexual assault.&lt;ref name=Forensic06&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ramsay, David |author2=Michael J.

One explanation for the effect is a cold-induced malfunction of the [[hypothalamus]], the part of the brain that regulates body temperature. Another explanation is that the muscles contracting peripheral blood vessels become exhausted (known as a loss of [[Vascular resistance|vasomotor tone]]) and relax, leading to a sudden surge of blood (and heat) to the extremities, causing the person to feel overheated.&lt;ref name=Forensic06/&gt;&lt;ref name=LegalMed&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rothschild MA, Schneider V | year = 1995 | title = 'Terminal burrowing behaviour'—a phenomenon of lethal hypothermia | url = | journal = Int J Legal Med | volume = 107 | issue = 5| pages = 250–6 | pmid = 7632602 | doi=10.1007/BF01245483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[Image:HypothermiaAge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The rate of hypothermia is strongly related to age in the United States]]
Hypothermia usually occurs from exposure to low temperatures, and is frequently complicated by [[Ethanol|alcohol]] consumption.&lt;ref name=Rosen2010/&gt; Any condition that decreases heat production, increases heat loss, or impairs thermoregulation, however, may contribute.&lt;ref name="Rosen2010"/&gt; Thus, hypothermia risk factors include: [[substance abuse]] (including alcohol abuse), [[homelessness]], any condition that affects judgment (such as hypoglycemia), the extremes of age, poor clothing, chronic medical conditions (such as hypothyroidism and [[sepsis]]), and living in a cold environment.&lt;ref name=Baum08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Hypothermia-related deaths—United States, 1999–2002 and 2005 | journal = MMWR Morb.

In urban areas, hypothermia frequently occurs with chronic cold exposure, such as in cases of homelessness, as well as with immersion accidents involving drugs, alcohol or mental illness.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-11-09|title=Hypothermia: Background, Pathophysiology, Etiology|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/770542-overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; While studies have shown that homeless people are at risk of premature death from hypothermia, the true incidence of hypothermia-related deaths in this population is difficult to determine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In more rural environments, the incidence of hypothermia is higher among people with significant comorbidities and less able to move independently.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With rising interest in wilderness exploration, and outdoor and water sports, the incidence of hypothermia secondary to accidental exposure may become more frequent in the general population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Alcohol===
Alcohol consumption increases the risk of hypothermia in two ways: [[vasodilation]] and temperature controlling systems in the brain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Goodman &amp; Gilman's: The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (13 ed.) |last=Mihic |first=John |last2=Koob |first2=George |last3=Mayfield |first3=Jody |last4=Harris |first4=Adron |last5=Brunton |first5=Laurence |last6=Hilal-Dandan |first6=Randa |last7=Knollmann |first7=Björn | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |year=2017 |isbn=1259584739 |location=|pages= |chapter=Ethanol}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine (20 ed.) |last=Danzl |first=Daniel |last2=Jameson |first2=Larry |last3=Fauci |first3=Anthony |last4=Kasper |first4=Dennis |last5=Hauser |first5=Stephen| name-list-format = vanc |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2018|isbn=1259644030|location=|pages=|chapter=Hypothermia and Peripheral Cold Injuries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasodilation increases blood flow to the skin, resulting in heat being lost to the environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This produces the effect of an individual ''feeling'' warm, when they are actually losing heat.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Alcohol also affects the temperature-regulating system in the brain, decreasing the body's ability to shiver and use energy that would normally aid the body in generating heat.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The overall effects of alcohol lead to a decrease in body temperature and a decreased ability to generate body heat in response to cold environments.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Alcohol is a common risk factor for death due to hypothermia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Between 33% and 73% of hypothermia cases are complicated by alcohol.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Hypothermia_Training,_Marine_Mountain_Warfare_Center,_California_USA.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Two American marines participating in an  immersion hypothermia exercise]]

Hypothermia continues to be a major limitation to swimming or [[Underwater diving|diving]] in cold water.&lt;ref name=sterba/&gt; The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which consequently increases the risk of other injuries.&lt;ref name=sterba/&gt;&lt;ref name=cheung/&gt;

Other factors predisposing to immersion hypothermia include [[dehydration]], inadequate rewarming between [[Dive profile#Repetitive diving|repetitive dives]], starting a dive while wearing cold, wet [[dry suit]] undergarments, [[Perspiration|sweating]] with work, inadequate [[thermal insulation]] (for example, thin dry suit undergarment), and poor [[Physical exercise|physical conditioning]].&lt;ref name=sterba/&gt;

Heat is lost much more quickly in water&lt;ref name=sterba&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sterba, JA |title=Field Management of Accidental Hypothermia during Diving |journal=US Naval Experimental Diving Unit Technical Report |volume=NEDU-1-90 |year=1990 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4248 |accessdate=2008-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727224238/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4248 |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; than in air. Thus, water temperatures that would be quite reasonable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia in survivors, although this is not usually the direct clinical cause of death for those who are not rescued. A water temperature of {{convert|10|C|F}} can lead to death in as little as one hour, and water temperatures near freezing can cause death in as little as 15 minutes.&lt;ref name="Hypothermia safety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usps.org/national/ensign/uspscompass/compassarchive/compassv1n1/hypothermia.htm |accessdate=2008-02-19 |title=Hypothermia safety |publisher=[[United States Power Squadrons]] |date=January 23, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208180845/http://www.usps.org/national/ensign/uspscompass/compassarchive/compassv1n1/hypothermia.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of this occurred during the [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the ''Titanic'']], when most people who entered the {{convert|-2|C|F}} water died in 15&amp;ndash;30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sinking of the RMS Titanic#CITEREFButler1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual cause of death in cold water is usually the [[Involuntary action|bodily reactions]] to heat loss and to freezing water, rather than hypothermia (loss of core temperature) itself. For example, plunged into freezing seas, around 20% of victims die within two minutes from [[cold shock response|cold shock]] (uncontrolled [[hyperventilation|rapid breathing]], and gasping, causing water inhalation, massive increase in blood pressure and cardiac strain leading to [[cardiac arrest]], and [[panic]]); another 50% die within 15–30 minutes from [[cold incapacitation]] (inability to use or control limbs and hands for swimming or gripping, as the body "protectively" shuts down the peripheral muscles of the limbs to protect its core).&lt;ref name="Vittone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mariovittone.com/2010/10/the-truth-about-cold-water/|title=The Truth About Cold Water|last=Vittone|first=Mario| name-list-format = vanc |date=21 October 2010|work=Survival|publisher=Mario Vittone|accessdate=24 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114154556/http://mariovittone.com/2010/10/the-truth-about-cold-water/|archivedate=14 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhaustion and unconsciousness cause drowning, claiming the rest within a similar time.&lt;ref name="Hypothermia safety"/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
{{HumanTemperature}}
Heat is primarily generated in muscle tissue, including the heart, and in the liver, while it is lost through the skin (90%) and lungs (10%).&lt;ref name=Care99/&gt; Heat production may be increased two- to four-fold through muscle contractions (i.e. exercise and shivering).&lt;ref name=Care99/&gt; The rate of heat loss is determined, as with any object, by [[convection]], [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]], and [[radiation]].&lt;ref name=Care99/&gt; The rates of these can be affected by [[body mass index]], body [[surface area]] to [[volume]] ratios, clothing and other environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nuckton TJ, Claman DM, Goldreich D, Wendt FC, Nuckton JG | title = Hypothermia and afterdrop following open water swimming: the Alcatraz/San Francisco Swim Study | journal = Am J Emerg Med | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 703–7 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11043627 | doi = 10.1053/ajem.2000.16313  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many changes to physiology occur as body temperatures decrease. These occur in the cardiovascular system leading to the [[Osborn wave|Osborn J wave]] and other dysrhythmias, decreased [[central nervous system]] electrical activity, [[diuresis#Cold-induced diuresis|cold diuresis]], and [[Pulmonary edema#Non-cardiogenic|non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |pages=1869–1870 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that glomerular filtration rates (GFR) decrease as a result of hypothermia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Broman M, Källskog O | title = The effects of hypothermia on renal function and haemodynamics in the rat | journal = Acta Physiologica Scandinavica | volume = 153 | issue = 2 | pages = 179–184 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7778458 | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-1716.1995.tb09849.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, hypothermia increases [[preglomerular vasoconstriction]], thus decreasing both renal blood flow (RBF) and GFR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Broman M, Källskog O, Kopp UC, Wolgast M | title = Influence of the sympathetic nervous system on renal function during hypothermia | journal = Acta Physiologica Scandinavica | volume = 163 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–249 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9715736 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-201x.1998.00356.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:HypothermiaECG.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Atrial fibrillation]] and [[Osborn wave|Osborn J wave]]s in a person with hypothermia.  Note what could be mistaken for [[ST elevation]].]]
Accurate determination of core temperature often requires a special low temperature thermometer, as most clinical thermometers do not measure accurately below {{convert|34.4|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="McCullough L, Arora S 2004 2325–32"/&gt;  A low temperature thermometer can be placed in the rectum, esophagus or bladder. Esophageal measurements are the most accurate and are recommended once a person is [[intubated]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Other methods of measurement such as in the mouth, under the arm, or using an [[infrared]] ear thermometer are often not accurate.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

As a hypothermic person's heart rate may be very slow, prolonged feeling for a pulse could be required before detecting. In 2005, the [[American Heart Association]] recommended at least 30–45 seconds to verify the absence of a pulse before initiating CPR.&lt;ref name=ACLS05&gt;{{cite journal | author = ECC Committee, Subcommittees and Task Forces of the American Heart Association | title = 2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care | journal = Circulation | volume = 112 | issue = 24 Suppl | pages = IV–136 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16314375 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166550 | url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-136 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110324012223/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-136 | archivedate = 2011-03-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others recommend a 60-second check.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

== Prevention ==
Appropriate clothing helps to prevent hypothermia. [[Synthetic fabric|Synthetic]] and [[wool]] fabrics are superior to cotton as they provide better insulation when wet and dry. Some synthetic fabrics, such as polypropylene and polyester, are used in clothing designed to wick perspiration away from the body, such as liner socks and moisture-wicking undergarments. Clothing should be loose fitting, as tight clothing reduces the circulation of warm blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topics: Cold Stress|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/coldstress/|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=21 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314001040/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/coldstress/|archivedate=14 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In planning outdoor activity, prepare appropriately for possible cold weather. Those who drink alcohol before or during outdoor activity should ensure at least one sober person is present responsible for safety.

Covering the head is effective, but no more effective than covering any other part of the body. While common folklore says that people lose most of their heat through their heads, heat loss from the head is no more significant than that from other uncovered parts of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sessler DI, Moayeri A, Støen R, Glosten B, Hynson J, McGuire J | title = Thermoregulatory vasoconstriction decreases cutaneous heat loss | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 656–60 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2221434 | doi = 10.1097/00000542-199010000-00011 | first6 = Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Sample, Ian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/dec/17/medicalresearch-humanbehaviour|title=Scientists debunk myth that most heat is lost through head &amp;#124; Science|work=The Guardian|date=December 18, 2008|accessdate=June 23, 2010|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905083755/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/dec/17/medicalresearch-humanbehaviour|archivedate=September 5, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, heat loss from the head is significant in infants, whose head is larger relative to the rest of the body than in adults.

Building a shelter can aid survival where there is danger of death from exposure.  Shelters can be of many different types, metal can conduct heat away from the occupants and is sometimes best avoided. The shelter should not be too big so body warmth stays near the occupants.  Good ventilation is essential especially if a fire will be lit in the shelter.  Fires should be put out before the occupants sleep to prevent [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning. People caught in very cold, snowy conditions can build an [[igloo]] or [[snow cave]] to shelter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wildearth.org/blog/how-to-build-an-igloo-survive-a-blizzard-finish-your-mission-on-time How to build an Igloo, survive a blizzard, finish your mission on time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201204942/http://wildearth.org/blog/how-to-build-an-igloo-survive-a-blizzard-finish-your-mission-on-time |date=2014-02-01 }} This web page gives basic instructions for westerners.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilderness-survival.net/cold-7.php Cold Weather Survival, Shelkters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118144516/http://www.wilderness-survival.net/cold-7.php |date=2014-01-18 }} This has instructions about building different types of shelter&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressiveness of treatment is matched to the degree of hypothermia.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Treatment ranges from noninvasive, passive external warming to active external rewarming, to active core rewarming.&lt;ref name="McCullough L, Arora S 2004 2325–32"/&gt; In severe cases resuscitation begins with simultaneous removal from the cold environment and management of the airway, breathing, and circulation. Rapid rewarming is then commenced. Moving the person as little and as gently as possible is recommended as aggressive handling may increase risks of a [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]].&lt;ref name=ACLS05/&gt;

[[Hypoglycemia]] is a frequent complication and needs to be tested for and treated. Intravenous [[thiamine]] and [[glucose]] is often recommended, as many causes of hypothermia are complicated by [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, Sixth edition |last=Tintinalli |first=Judith | name-list-format = vanc |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |isbn=0-07-138875-3 |page=1181 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[National Health Service]] advises the lay public against putting a person in a hot bath, massaging their arms and legs, using a heating pad, or giving them alcohol.

Between 1995 and 2004 in the United States, an average of 1560 cold-related emergency department visits occurred per year and in the years 1999 to 2004, an average of 647 people died per year due to hypothermia.&lt;ref name=Baum08&gt;Baumgartner, Hypothermia and Other Cold-Related Morbidity Emergency Department Visits: United States, 1995–2004 Wilderness and Environmental Medicine, 19, 233 237 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5615a3.htm#tab |title=Hypothermia-Related Mortality – Montana, 1999–2004 |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424001921/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5615a3.htm#tab |archivedate=2009-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of deaths reported between 1999 and 2002 in the US, 49% of those affected were 65 years or older and two-thirds were male.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/654/epidemiology|title=BMJ Best Practice|website=bestpractice.bmj.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most deaths were not work related (63%) and 23% of affected people were at home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hypothermia was most common during the autumn and winter months of October through March.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the United Kingdom, an estimated 300 deaths per year are due to hypothermia, whereas the annual incidence of hypothermia-related deaths in Canada is 8000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Prianishnikov 1812.jpg|thumb|The armies of [[Napoleon]] retreat from Russia in 1812.]]
[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner 081.jpg|thumb|''[[Snow-storm: Hannibal and His Army Crossing the Alps]]'', [[J. M. W. Turner]]]]
Hypothermia has played a major role in the success or failure of many military campaigns, from [[Hannibal]]'s loss of nearly half his men in the [[Second Punic War]] (218 [[Before Christ|B.C.]]) to the [[French invasion of Russia#Retreat and losses|near destruction]] of [[Napoleon]]'s armies in [[Russia]] in 1812.  Men wandered around confused by hypothermia, some lost consciousness and died, others shivered, later developed [[torpor]], and tended to sleep.  Others too weak to walk fell on their knees; some stayed that way some time resisting death.  The [[pulse]] of some was weak and hard to detect; others groaned; yet others had eyes open and wild with quiet delirium.&lt;ref name=Guly/&gt; Loss of life to hypothermia in Russian regions continued through the [[World War I|first]] and [[World War II|second]] world wars, especially in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |page=1868 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian examples of deaths caused by hypothermia occurred during the sinkings of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] and [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']], and more recently of the [[MS Estonia|MS ''Estonia'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Findings: Titanic victims in 'cold shock'|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/169325.article|accessdate=22 November 2014|page=24 May 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129131742/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/169325.article|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=John Updike|title=Remember the Lusitania|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/07/01/remember-the-lusitania|accessdate=22 November 2014|date=1 July 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129040244/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/07/01/remember-the-lusitania|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soomer et al., 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soomer H, Ranta H, Penttilä A | title = Identification of victims from the M/S Estonia | journal = International Journal of Legal Medicine | volume = 114 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 259–262 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11355406 | doi = 10.1007/s004140000180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antarctic]] explorers developed hypothermia; [[Ernest Shackleton]] and his team measured body temperatures "below 94.2°, which spells death at home", though this probably referred to oral temperatures rather than core temperature and corresponded to mild hypothermia.  One of [[Robert Falcon Scott|Scott's]] team, Atkinson, became confused through hypothermia.&lt;ref name=Guly&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guly|first1=H|title=History of accidental hypothermia.|journal=Resuscitation|date=Jan 2011|volume=82|issue=1|pages=122–5|pmid=21036455|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.09.465|pmc=3060344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nazi human experimentation]] during [[World War II]] amounting to [[medical torture]] included [[Nazi human experimentation#Freezing experiments|hypothermia experiments]], which killed many victims. There were 360 to 400 experiments and 280 to 300 subjects, indicating some had more than one experiment performed on them. Various methods of rewarming were attempted, "One assistant later testified that some victims were thrown into boiling water for rewarming".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=RL|title=Nazi science--the Dachau hypothermia experiments.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=May 17, 1990|volume=322|issue=20|pages=1435–40|pmid=2184357|doi=10.1056/NEJM199005173222006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
Many animals other than humans often induce hypothermia during [[hibernation]] or [[torpor]].

Water bears ([[Tardigrade]]), microscopic multicellular organisms, can survive [[freezing]] at low temperatures by replacing most of their internal water with the [[sugar]] [[trehalose]], preventing the crystallization that otherwise damages [[cell membranes]].

'''Isothermal titration calorimetry''' ('''ITC''') is a physical technique used to determine the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] parameters of interactions in solution. It is most often used to study the binding of small molecules (such as medicinal compounds) to larger [[macromolecules]] ([[proteins]], [[DNA]] etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pierce |first1=Michael M. |last2=Raman |first2=C.S. |last3=Nall |first3=Barry T. |title=Isothermal Titration Calorimetry of Protein–Protein Interactions |journal=Methods |date=1999 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=213–221 |doi=10.1006/meth.1999.0852 |pmid=10527727 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202399908526}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It consists of two cells which are enclosed in an [[adiabatic]] jacket. The compounds to be studied are placed in the sample cell, while the other cell, the reference cell, is used as a control and contains the buffer in which the sample is dissolved.

==Thermodynamic measurements==
ITC is a [[quantitative property|quantitative]] technique that can determine the [[Chemical affinity|binding affinity]] (&lt;math&gt;K_a&lt;/math&gt;), [[enthalpy]] changes (&lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt;), and binding [[stoichiometry]] (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) of the interaction between two or more molecules in solution. From these initial measurements, [[Gibbs energy]] changes (&lt;math&gt;\Delta G&lt;/math&gt;) and [[entropy]] changes (&lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt;) can be determined using the relationship:

:::&lt;math&gt;\Delta G = -RT\,\mathrm{ln}K_a = \Delta H -T\Delta S&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt; R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gas constant]] and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[absolute temperature]]).

==The instrument==
[[Image:ITC1.png|thumb|400px|Schematic of an ITC instrument]]
An [[isothermal titration calorimeter]] is composed of two identical cells made of a highly efficient thermally conducting and chemically inert material such as [[Hastelloy]] alloy or gold, surrounded by an [[adiabatic]] jacket.&lt;ref&gt;O’Brien, R., Ladbury, J.E. and Chowdry B.Z. (2000) Isothermal titration calorimetry of biomolecules. Chapter 10 in Protein-Ligand interactions: hydrodynamics and calorimetry Ed. Harding, S.E. and Chowdry, B.Z, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-963746-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sensitive thermopile/thermocouple circuits are used to detect temperature differences between the reference cell (filled with buffer or water) and the sample cell containing the macromolecule. Prior to addition of ligand, a constant power (&lt;1&amp;nbsp;mW) is applied to the reference cell. This directs a feedback circuit, activating a heater located on the sample cell.&lt;ref&gt;VP-ITC Instruction Manual (2001). Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA. http://www.microcalorimetry.com&lt;/ref&gt; During the experiment, ligand is titrated into the sample cell in precisely known aliquots, causing heat to be either taken up or evolved (depending on the nature of the reaction). Measurements consist of the time-dependent input of power required to maintain equal temperatures between the sample and reference cells. 

In an [[exothermic]] reaction, the temperature in the sample cell increases upon addition of [[ligand]].  This causes the feedback power to the sample cell to be decreased (remember: a reference power is applied to the reference cell) in order to maintain an equal temperature between the two cells.  In an [[endothermic]] reaction, the opposite occurs; the feedback circuit increases the power in order to maintain a constant temperature (isothermic/isothermal operation).

Observations are plotted as the power needed to maintain the reference and the sample cell at an identical temperature against time. As a result, the experimental raw data consists of a series of spikes of heat flow (power), with every spike corresponding to one ligand injection. These heat flow spikes/pulses are integrated with respect to time, giving the total heat exchanged per injection. The pattern of these heat effects as a function of the molar ratio [ligand]/[macromolecule] can then be analysed to give the thermodynamic parameters of the interaction under study.  Degassing samples is often necessary in order to obtain good measurements as the presence of gas bubbles within the sample cell will lead to abnormal data plots in the recorded results. The entire experiment takes place under computer control.

==Application in drug discovery==
ITC is one of the latest techniques to be used in characterizing binding affinity of ligands for proteins. It is typically used as a secondary screening technique in high throughput screening. ITC is particularly useful as it gives not only the binding affinity, but also the thermodynamics of the binding. This thermodynamic characterization allows for further optimization of compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Desphande, T.[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2012/08/isothermal-titration-calorimetry-application-in-drug-discovery/ Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC): Application in Drug Discovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[statistical mechanics]] of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] systems and [[quantum field theory]], the properties of a system in thermal equilibrium can be described by a mathematical object called a '''[[Ryogo Kubo|Kubo]]–Martin–[[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]] state''' or, more commonly, a '''KMS state''': a state satisfying the '''KMS condition'''. {{harvtxt|Kubo|1957}} introduced the condition, {{harvtxt|Martin|Schwinger|1959}} used it to define [[thermodynamic]] [[Green's function|Greens function]]s, and 
{{harvs|txt | last1=Haag | first1=Rudolf | author1-link=Rudolf Haag | last2=Winnink | first2=M. | last3=Hugenholtz | first3=N. M.  | year=1967 }} used the condition to define equilibrium states and called it the KMS condition.

== Overview ==

The simplest case to study is that of a finite-dimensional [[Hilbert space]], in which one does not encounter complications like [[phase transition]]s or [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]. The [[density matrix]] of a '''thermal state''' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{\beta,\mu}=\frac{e^{-\beta \left(H-\mu N\right)}}{\mathrm{Tr}\left[ e^{-\beta \left(H-\mu N\right)} \right]}=\frac{e^{-\beta \left(H-\mu N\right)}}{Z(\beta,\mu)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H'' is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] [[Operator (physics)|operator]] and ''N'' is the [[particle number operator]] (or [[charge (physics)|charge]] operator, if we wish to be more general) and

:&lt;math&gt;Z(\beta,\mu)\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \mathrm{Tr}\left[ e^{-\beta \left(H-\mu N\right)} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]]. We assume that ''N'' commutes with ''H,'' or in other words, that particle number is [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved]].

In the [[Heisenberg picture]], the density matrix does not change with time, but the operators are time-dependent. In particular, translating an operator ''A'' by τ into the future gives the operator

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_\tau(A)\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  e^{iH\tau}A e^{-iH\tau}&lt;/math&gt;.

A combination of [[time translation]] with an [[internal symmetry]] "rotation" gives the more general

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^{\mu}_{\tau}(A)\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  e^{i\left(H-\mu N\right)\tau} A e^{-i\left(H-\mu N\right)\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

A bit of algebraic manipulation shows that the [[expected value]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\alpha^\mu_\tau(A)B\rangle_{\beta,\mu}=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\rho \alpha^\mu_\tau(A)B\right]=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\rho B \alpha^\mu_{\tau+i\beta}(A)\right]=\langle B\alpha^\mu_{\tau+i\beta}(A)\rangle_{\beta,\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

for any two operators ''A'' and ''B'' and any real τ (we are working with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces after all). We used the fact that the density matrix commutes with any function of (''H''-μ''N'') and that the [[Trace class|trace]] is cyclic.

As hinted at earlier, with infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, we run into a lot of problems like phase transitions, spontaneous symmetry breaking, operators that are not [[trace class]], divergent partition functions, etc..

The [[complex function]]s of ''z'', &lt;math&gt;\langle\alpha^\mu_z(A)B\rangle&lt;/math&gt; converges in the complex strip &lt;math&gt;-\beta &lt; \Im{z} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; 
whereas &lt;math&gt;\langle B\alpha^\mu_z(A)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; converges in the complex strip
&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \Im{z} &lt; \beta&lt;/math&gt;
if we make certain technical assumptions like the [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of ''H''-μ''N'' is bounded from below and its density does not increase exponentially (see [[Hagedorn temperature]]). If the functions converge, then they have to be [[Analytic function|analytic]] within the strip they are defined over as their derivatives,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dz}\langle\alpha^\mu_z(A)B\rangle=i\langle\alpha^\mu_z\left(\left[H-\mu N,A\right]\right)B\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dz}\langle B\alpha^\mu_z(A)\rangle = i\langle B\alpha^\mu_z\left(\left[H-\mu N,A\right]\right)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

exist.

However, we can still define a '''KMS state''' as any state satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \alpha^\mu_\tau(A)B\rangle=\langle B\alpha^\mu_{\tau+i\beta}(A)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\langle\alpha^\mu_z(A)B\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle B\alpha^\mu_z(A)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; being analytic functions of ''z'' within their domain strips.

&lt;math&gt;\langle\alpha^\mu_\tau(A)B\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle B\alpha^\mu_{\tau+i\beta}(A)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are the boundary [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] values of the analytic functions in question.

This gives the right large volume, large particle number thermodynamic limit. If there is a phase transition or spontaneous symmetry breaking, the KMS state is not unique.

The density matrix of a KMS state is related to [[unitary transformation]]s involving time translations (or time translations and an [[internal symmetry]] transformation for nonzero chemical potentials) via the [[Tomita–Takesaki theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3027">The '''Keston Institute''' ('''Keston College''')&lt;ref name=kes/&gt; is an organisation dedicated to the [[religious studies|study of religion]] and [[communist countries]], at [[Oxford]], England. It was founded in 1969 by the Revd Canon Michael Bourdeaux.

==History==
In the 1950s, Michael Bourdeaux spent a year in [[Moscow]] as a part of the first wave of British exchange students; he soon found only 41 [[Russian Orthodox Church]]es to still be functioning out of the 1,600 before the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917. This prompted him to take up the cause of those persecuted for their religious faith.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; 

In 1969 Bourdeaux founded at [[Chislehurst]] the Centre for the Study of Religion and Communism&lt;ref name=rus&gt;''The Future of Freedom in Russia'', by William J. Vanden Heuvel. Published by Templeton Foundation Press, 2000. {{ISBN|1-890151-43-2}}. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; together with Sir John Lawrence, and with the help of [[Leonard Schapiro]] and Peter Reddaway, Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at [[George Washington University]]. In the early 1970s he bought the old parish school on [[Keston]] Common and the centre was renamed [[Keston College]]. Later it broadened its purview to include former communist countries with its main concerns being the former [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref name=kes&gt;[http://www.keston.org.uk/information.shtml About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107044403/http://www.keston.org.uk/information.shtml |date=2009-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years it played a key role in the revival of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Orthodoxy Resurgent: Faith and Power in the New Russia'', by John Garrard, Carol Garrard. Published by Princeton University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|0-691-12573-2}}. ''Page xv''.&lt;/ref&gt; and has become a leading voice on [[religious freedom]] in former communist countries, with an emphasis on the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2000-1/weekly/210900/ads.htm  the Keston Institute is an Oxford- based research charity which is...] ''[[Oxford University]] Gazette.'', 2000-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the enterprise was relocated to Oxford.

In 1984 [[Michael Bourdeaux]] won the [[Templeton Prize]]. The current chairman at the Keston Institute is [[Xenia Dennen]].

Since 2007, the Keston Institute's archive and library have been under the care of the Keston Center for Religion, Politics, &amp; Society at [[Baylor University]], [[Waco, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baylor.edu/kestoncenter/ Keston Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal realism'''  is a [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] approach to [[law]] and is the view that [[jurisprudence]] should emulate the methods of [[natural science]], i.e., rely on [[empirical evidence]]. [[Hypotheses]] have to be tested against observations of the world. 

Legal realists believe that the legal science should investigate law exclusively with the value-free methods of natural sciences, also called 'sciences of the real' in some [[Continental Europe|Continental]] languages (e.g., 'Realwissenschaften', in [[German language|German]]). Some legal realists (e.g., [[Leon Petrażycki]] and [[Max Weber]]) also hold that there should exist, too, a legal dogmatics, which is independent of legal science proper but, this notwithstanding, can be regarded as a science in its own right (and so, despite its being a non-real, or formal, science). However, the focus of all legal realists is on legal science proper.

==Overview==
Due to their value-free approach, legal realists are opposed to [[natural law]] traditions. Legal realists regard these traditions as historical and/or social phenomena to be explained by making use of a variety of psychological and sociological hypotheses. They are also opposed to any form of [[linguistic turn]] in jurisprudence. When applied to law, they regard the linguistic turn as a sort of 'emasculation' (Enrico Pattaro) of legal phenomena. This is so because legal realists conceive legal phenomena as psychical phenomena, and, notably, as a form of ''moral motivation'' of human behavior (to be investigated with the methods of psychology and/or neurosciences). All this implies that legal realists are opposed to most versions of contemporary [[legal positivism]].

A further difference from all sorts of legal positivism is that legal realists refuse to confine their investigations to state law and/or positive law. Moreover, legal realists have a conception of law that stretches far beyond legal pluralism—so popular in many versions of classical and contemporary [[sociology of law]]. This is one of the reasons why legal realism cannot be regarded as a sort of sociology of law (other reasons being: legal realists' psychologism and their refusal of the linguistic turn—a turn that affected, too, sociology of law). Apart from Max Weber (who, owing to a variety of reasons, is mostly conceptualized as sociologist rather than as a legal realist), there are two strands of legal realism in this sense: Scandinavian legal realism, founded by [[Axel Hägerström]] (1868&amp;ndash;1939), and Polish-Russian legal realism, founded by [[Leon Petrażycki]] (1867&amp;ndash;1931). Both realisms, owing to their similarities (and despite their founders' ignoring one another), are sometimes referred to as 'continental legal realism' (in the singular).

In English-speaking countries the phrase 'legal realism' has often a somewhat different and more restricted meaning. It is used to refer to a conception of adjudication rather than of law in general. However, some legal realists in this other sense, including the founder of this movement, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], reduced law to the activity of courts and other state officials, thus proposing a kind of naturalistic and value-free reduction of law (a conception, though, that all Continental legal realists would reject, ''[[inter alia]]'', as excessively narrow). It is to this other kind of legal realism—also called 'American legal realism'—that this entry is devoted.

American legal realists (henceforth: realists) believe that there is more to adjudication than the mechanical application of known legal principles to uncontroversial fact-finding as [[legal formalism]] believes. Some realists believe that one can never be sure that the facts and [[law]] identified in the judge's reasons were the actual reasons for the judgment, whereas other realists accept that a judge's reasons can often be relied upon, but not all of the time. Realists believe that the legal principles that [[legal formalism]] treat as uncontroversial actually hide contentious political and moral choices.

Realism was treated as a conceptual claim for much of the late 20th century due to [[H. L. A. Hart]]'s misunderstanding of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, H. L. A. (1961). The Concept of Law (2nd ed. / with a postscript edited by Penelope A. Bulloch and Joseph Raz.). Oxford: Clarendon Press. Ch.VII&lt;/ref&gt; Hart was an analytical legal philosopher who was interested in conceptual analysis of concepts such as the concept of 'law'. This entailed identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept 'law'. When realists such as Oliver Wendell Holmes pointed out that individuals embroiled in the legal system generally wanted to know what was going to happen, Hart assumed that they were offering the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept 'law'. Nowadays, legal theorists tend to recognise that the realists and the conceptual lawyers were interested in different questions. Realists are interested in methods of predicting judges with more accuracy, whereas conceptual lawyers are interested in the correct use of legal concepts.

Legal realism was primarily a reaction to the [[legal formalism]] of the late 19th century and early 20th century, and was the dominant approach for much of the early 20th century. It succeeded in its negative aspiration of casting doubt upon formalist assumptions that judges always did what they said so that it is often said that 'we are all realists now.' However, realism failed in its positive aspiration of discovering a better way of predicting how judges would behave than relying on the reasons given by judges.

A theory of law and legal reasoning that arose in the early decades of the twentieth century broadly characterized by the claim that law can be best understood by focusing on what judges actually ''do'' in deciding cases, rather than on what they say they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Shiner, "Legal Realism," in Robert Audi, ed., ''The Cambridge Dictionary of'' ''Philosophy''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; The central target of legal realism was legal formalism: the classical view that judges don't make law, but mechanically apply it by logically deducing uniquely correct legal conclusions from a set of clear, consistent, and comprehensive legal rules.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leiter, "American Legal Realism," in Martin P. Golding and William A. Edmundson, eds., ''The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Law and Legal Theory''. Oxford: Blackwell, 2005, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; American legal realism has aptly been described as "the most important indigenous jurisprudential movement in the United States during the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 50. There was also a Scandinavian school of legal realism that arose about the same time as its American cousin. This entry focuses on American legal realism.&lt;/ref&gt; Though most legal scholars today would agree that some aspects of legal realism were misguided or over-stated, its enduring influence on legal thought and legal education has been profound.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Although the American legal realist movement first emerged as a cohesive intellectual force in the 1920s, it drew heavily upon a number of prior thinkers and was influenced by broader cultural forces. In the early years of the twentieth century, formalist approaches to the law had been forcefully criticized by thinkers such as [[Roscoe Pound]], [[John Chipman Gray]], and [[Benjamin Cardozo]]. Philosophers such as [[John Dewey]] had held up empirical science as a model of all intelligent inquiry, and argued that law should be seen as a practical instrument for advancing human welfare. Outside the realm of law, in fields such as economics and history, there was a general "revolt against formalism," a reaction in favor of more empirical ways of doing philosophy and the human sciences.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Neil Duxbury, ''Patterns of American Jurisprudence''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; But by far the most important intellectual influence on the legal realists was the thought of the American jurist and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.

===[[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]]===
Holmes is a towering figure in American legal thought for many reasons, but what the realists drew most from Holmes was his famous [[prediction theory of law]], his utilitarian approach to legal reasoning, and his "realist" insistence that judges, in deciding cases, are not simply deducing legal conclusions with inexorable, machine-like logic, but are influenced by ideas of fairness, public policy, and other personal and conventional values.

All these themes can be found in Holmes's famous 1897 essay, "The Path of the Law." There Holmes attacks formalist approaches to judicial decision making and states a pragmatic definition of "law": "The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law".&lt;ref name="Holmes, Jr."&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., "The Path of the Law," 10 ''Harvard Law Review'' 457 (1897).&lt;/ref&gt; If law is prophecy, Holmes continues, we must reject the view of "text writers" who tell you that law "is something different from what is decided by the courts of Massachusetts or England, that it is a system of reason that is a deduction from principles of ethics or admitted axioms or what not, which may or may not coincide with the decisions".&lt;ref name="Holmes, Jr." /&gt;

Holmes next introduces his most important and influential argument, the "bad-man" theory of law: "[I]f we take the view of our friend the bad man we shall find that he does not care two straws" about either the morality or the logic of the law. For the bad man, "legal duty" signifies only "a prophecy that if he does certain things he will be subjected to disagreeable consequences by way of imprisonment or compulsory payment".&lt;ref name="Holmes, Jr." /&gt; The bad man cares nothing for legal theorizing and concerns himself only with practical consequences. In the spirit of [[pragmatism]], Holmes suggests that this is useful way of laying bare the true meaning of legal concepts.

The utilitarian or instrumentalist flavor of "The Path of the Law" also found favor with the realists. The purpose of the law, Holmes insisted, was the deterrence of undesirable social consequences: "I think that the judges themselves have failed adequately to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage."&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;William W. Fisher III, Morton J. Horwitz, Thomas A. Reed, eds., ''American Legal Realism''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Civil War, this conception of adjudication as a form of social engineering had been widely shared by American judges, but in the late nineteenth century it had fallen out of favor.&lt;ref&gt;Morton J. Horwitz, ''The Transformation of American'' ''Law, 1870–1960: The Crisis of Legal Orthodoxy''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; One of the aspirations of both Holmes and the realists was to revive it.

==Key themes==
Drawing upon Holmes and other critics of legal formalism, a number of iconoclastic legal scholars launched the legal realist movement in the 1920s and 30s. Among the leading legal realists were [[Karl Llewellyn]], [[Jerome Frank]], [[Herman Oliphant]], [[Underhill Moore]], Walter Wheeler Cook, [[Leon Green]], and [[Felix Cohen]]. Two American law schools, Yale and Columbia, were hotbeds of realist thought. Realism was a mood more than it was a cohesive movement, but it is possible to identify a number of common themes. These include:

* ''A distrust of the judicial technique of seeming to deduce legal conclusions from so-called rules of law''. The realists believed that judges neither do nor should decide cases formalistically.  Law is not, as the formalists claimed, a system of rules that is clear, consistent, and complete. Rather, the law is riddled with ambiguities, contradictions, gaps, vague terms, and conflicting rules of interpretation. As a result, there is often (perhaps always) no uniquely correct answer to any hard case that appellate judges decide. Law is incurably "indeterminate."
* ''A belief in the instrumental nature of the law''. Like Dewey and Pound, the realists believed that law does and should serve social ends. Judges unavoidably take account of considerations of fairness and public policy, and they are right to do so.&lt;ref&gt;According to legal scholar Brian Leiter, the "core claim" of legal realism is that judges do not decide cases on purely legal grounds; other factors play a significant and in fact predominant role. Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A desire to separate legal from moral elements in the law''. The realists were legal positivists who believed that law should be treated scientifically. A clear distinction should be drawn between what the law is and what it should be. Law can only be viewed as an empirical science, as it ought to be, if moralistic notions are either excluded or are translated into empirically verifiable terms.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Christie, ''Jurisprudence: Text and Readings on the Philosophy of Law''. St. Paul, MN: West Publishing Co., 1973, pp. 642–644.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that legal talk of "duty," "right," etc. is really just talk about how judges are likely to decide cases, is a clear example of how many realists tried to purge law of moralistic language and translate everything into "realistic" talk of actual consequences and testable predictions.

==Criticisms==

Legal realism had its heyday from the 1920s to the 1940s. In the 1950s, legal realism was largely supplanted by the legal process movement, which viewed law as a process of "reasoned elaboration" and claimed that appeals to "legislative purpose" and other well-established legal norms could provide objectively correct answers to most legal questions. In his 1961 book ''The'' ''Concept of Law'', British legal theorist H. L. A. Hart dealt what many scholars saw as a "decisive blow"&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 61. Leiter argues that Hart's criticism was off the mark, and that it was ''wrongly'' assumed to have refuted legal realism.&lt;/ref&gt; to legal realism, by attacking the predictive theory of law that many realists had taken over from Holmes. Hart pointed out that if a law is just a prediction of what courts will do, a judge pondering the legal merits of a case before him is really asking, "How will I decide this case?" As Hart notes, this completely misses the fact that judges use legal rules to ''guide'' their decisions, not as data to predict their eventual holdings.

Many critics have claimed that the realists exaggerated the extent to which law is "riddled" with gaps, contradictions, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Frederick Schauer, "Easy Cases," ''Southern California Law Review'', Vol. 38 (1985), p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that most legal questions have simple, clear-cut answers that no lawyer or judge would dispute is difficult to square with the realists' strong claims of pervasive legal "indeterminacy." Other critics, such as [[Ronald Dworkin]] and [[Lon Fuller]], have faulted legal realists for their attempt sharply to separate law and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin, ''Taking Rights'' ''Seriously''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1978, pp. 22-28; Lon L. Fuller, ''The Morality of Law'', rev. ed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, pp. 33-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and continuing relevance==
Though many aspects of legal realism are now seen as exaggerated or outdated, most legal theorists would agree that the realists were successful in their central ambition: to refute "formalist" or "mechanical" notions of law and legal reasoning. It is widely accepted today that law is not, and cannot be, an exact science, and that it is important to examine what judges are actually doing in deciding cases, not merely what they say they are doing. As ongoing debates about [[judicial activism]] and judicial restraint attest, legal scholars continue to disagree about when, if ever, it is legitimate for judges to "make law," as opposed to merely "following" or "applying" existing law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lief H. Carter and Thomas F. Burke, ''Reason in Law'', 8th ed. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2015 (contending that law is frequently indeterminate and that judges often do, and should, make law by employing a variety of legal methods and sources, especially "purposive" interpretation); and Antonin Scalia and Bryan A. Garner, ''Reading'' ''Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts''. Minneapolis: West, 2012 (arguing that law is not highly indeterminate and that there is little legitimate leeway for judicial policymaking).&lt;/ref&gt; But few would disagree with the realists' core claim that judges (for good or ill) are often strongly influenced by their political beliefs, their personal values, their individual personalities, and other extra-legal factors.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 60 (noting that "[t]he paradigm of scholarship established by the Realists--contrasting what courts say they're doing with what they ''actually'' do--is one that has become so much the norm that distinguished scholars practice it without even feeling the need, any longer, to self-identify as Realists").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal realism and the European Court of Human Rights==
A statistical natural language processing method has been applied to automatically predict the outcome of cases tried by the European Court of Human Rights (violation or no violation of a specific article) based on their textual contents, reaching a prediction accuracy of 79%.&lt;ref name="ecthr2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N. Aletras |author2=D. Tsarapatsanis |author3=D. Preotiuc-Pietro |author4=V. Lampos | title=Predicting judicial decisions of the European Court of Human Rights: a Natural Language Processing perspective | journal=PeerJ Computer Science | year=2016 | url=https://peerj.com/articles/cs-93/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent qualitative analysis of these results provided some support towards the theory of legal realism. The authors write: "In general, and notwithstanding the simplified snapshot of a very complex debate that we just presented, our results could be understood as lending some support to the basic legal realist intuition according to which judges are primarily responsive to non-legal, rather than to legal, reasons when they decide hard cases."

}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[South Africa]]n [[sociologist]] specialising in the study of [[genocide]].

==Early life and legal career==

Kuper was born to a [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] family. His siblings included his sister Mary (d. 1948), who in later life directed the Johannesburg Legal Aid Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1950_9_BritishCommon.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent-1994-05-27" /&gt;

Kuper trained in law at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], receiving there his BA and LLB degrees.&lt;ref name="independent-1994-05-27" /&gt; As a lawyer, he represented African clients in human-rights cases, and also represented one of the country's early non-[[racial segregation|segregated]] [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref name="independent-1994-05-27" /&gt; He supported the establishment of South Africa's first [[legal aid]] charity.&lt;ref name="independent-1994-05-27" /&gt;

==Wartime service==

Kuper served with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] in Kenya, Egypt, and Italy, as an [[intelligence officer]], from 1940 to 1946.&lt;ref name="independent-1994-05-27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt; After the war he organised the National War Memorial Health Foundation, which provided social and medical services for disadvantaged people from all backgrounds.&lt;ref name="independent-1994-05-27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt;

==Scholarly and political activities==

In 1947 Kuper went to the [[University of North Carolina]], where he earned an M.A. in sociology.&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt; He was subsequently appointed Lecturer in Sociology at the [[University of Birmingham]] in England.&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt;

At Birmingham, Kuper directed a research project intended to help the city of [[Coventry]] recover from the bombing it received during World War II.&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt; This project culminated in the publication of ''Living in Towns'' (1953).&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt; Kuper completed a doctorate in sociology at the University of Birmingham in 1952, and moved to [[Durban]], South Africa, as Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Natal]].&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt;

Kuper was an active opponent of [[apartheid]]. Under his headship, the Sociology Department at the [[University of Natal]] was the only [[Racial integration|integrated]] academic department in South Africa.{{sfn|van den Berghe|1989|pp=158-159}} Kuper and his colleague [[Fatima Meer]] were subjected to [[surveillance]] by the apartheid government, and classes taught in the department were infiltrated by government spies, resulting in a [[chilling effect]].{{sfn|van den Berghe|1989|p=170}}

During his time in Durban, Kuper co-founded the [[Liberal Party of South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Longhua Temple''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|龙|华|寺}}|t={{linktext|龍|華|寺}}|p={{linktext|Lóng|húa| Sì}}''; &lt;small&gt;[[Shanghainese]]&lt;/small&gt;:'' Lon-ngu-zy}}, literally ''"[[Lustre (mineralogy)|Lustre]] of the [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] Temple''") is a [[Buddhist temple]] dedicated to the [[Maitreya|Maitreya Buddha]] located in [[Shanghai]]. Although most of the present-day buildings date from later reconstructions, the temple preserves the architectural design of a [[Song dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) monastery of the [[Chinese Chán|Chan School]]. It is the largest, most authentic and complete ancient temple complex in the city of Shanghai.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

==History==
[[Image:Longhua temple1.JPG|right|thumb|Newly constructed front gate of Longhua. The site of the original gates, further in front, is now marked by two standing pillars and a set of original stone lions.]]

The temple was first built in 242 AD, during the [[Three Kingdoms Period]] (220&amp;ndash;165). According to a legend, [[Sun Quan]], King of the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]] (222&amp;ndash;280), had obtained [[Ringsel|Sharira]] relics, which are cremated remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. To house these precious relics, the king ordered the construction of 13 pagodas. Longhua Pagoda ({{zh|s=龙华塔|t=|labels=no}}), part of the Longhua temple complex, is said to have been one of them. Like the function of the pagoda, the name of the temple also has its origin in a local legend according to which a dragon once appeared on the site.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

The temple was destroyed by war towards the end of the [[Tang dynasty]] (618&amp;ndash;907) and rebuilt in 977 AD, under the autonomous Kingdom of [[Wuyue]] during the [[Song dynasty|Northern Song dynasty]] period (960&amp;ndash;1127). (According to another version of the story, as contained in [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) and [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271&amp;ndash;1368) local histories, the temple was first built by the King of [[Wuyue]].) Later in the Song dynasty, in 1064, it was renamed "Kongxiang Temple" ({{zh|s=空相寺|t=|labels=no}}), but the original name "Longhua Temple" was restored in the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368&amp;ndash;1644) during the reign of the [[Wanli Emperor]] (1573&amp;ndash;1620).

The present architectural design follows the [[Song dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) original. However, whereas the core of the present Longhua Pagoda survives from that period, most buildings in the temple proper were rebuilt during the reigns of the [[Tongzhi Emperor]] (1862&amp;ndash;1874) and the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (1875&amp;ndash;1908) in the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644&amp;ndash;1911). A modern restoration of the entire temple complex was carried out in 1954.

The temple and monastery were originally surrounded by extensive gardens and orchards. Viewing of the peach blossom in the Longhua gardens was an annual attraction for people in surrounding cities.

The temple grounds have been used as a site for internment as well as for executions. Public executions were held on the site in the 19th century. In 1927, the [[Kuomintang]] carried out a purge of suspected communists in Shanghai. Thousands of victims of this purge were brought to the temple grounds to be executed. They are commemorated today by the Longhua Martyrs Cemetery behind the temple. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] operated their largest civilian internment camp in the area, where [[United States|American]], [[Great Britain|British]], as well as nationals of other [[Allies of World War II|allied countries]] were held under poor conditions.

The temple's extensive gardens have since been almost entirely absorbed into the neighbouring Longhua Martyrs Cemetery and have been extensively reconstructed in a contemporary monumental style. A small traditional garden remains immediately adjacent to the temple buildings.

==Architectural design and artwork==
[[Image:500lohan longhuatemple.jpg|right|thumb|Statues of the 500 arhats]]
[[Image:Longhua Pagoda.JPG|thumb|right|The exterior of the Longhua Pagoda]]

The Longhua Temple occupies an area of more than {{Convert|20000|m2|sqft|-3}} and the main axis of the compound is {{Convert|194|m|ft}} long. The tallest structure is the Longhua Pagoda which stands {{Convert|40.4|m|ftin}} high.

The layout of the temple is that of a Song dynasty monastery of the Buddhist Chan sect, known as the ''Sangharama Five-Hall Style''. Five main halls are arranged along a central north-south pointing axis. From the entrance, the buildings are:

===Maitreya Hall===
The Maitreya Hall housing a statue of [[Maitreya]] buddha and another in his manifestation as "[[Budai]]", or ''Cloth bag monk''.

===Four Heavenly Kings Hall===
The [[Four Heavenly Kings Hall]] housing statues of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]].

===Mahavira Hall===
The [[Mahavira Hall]] is the main hall, housing statues of the historical Buddha ([[Shakyamuni]]) and two disciples. At the back of the hall is a bas-relief carving, including a depiction of [[Guanyin]], or the Buddistava [[Avalokiteśvara]] in his female manifestation. Around the front portion are arranged the twenty Guardians of Buddhist Law, and around the back the sixteen principal [[arhat]]s. The hall also features an ancient bell cast in 1586, during the [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] era of the [[Ming dynasty]].

===Three Sages Hall===
The Three Sages Hall ({{zh|s=三圣殿|t=|labels=no}}) houses statues of the [[Amitabha]] buddha, and the Buddistavas [[Avalokiteśvara]] (male form) and Mahāsthāmaprāpta.

===Abbot's Hall===
The Abbot's Hall ({{zh|s=方丈室|t=|labels=no}}) is a place for lectures and formal meetings.

===Bell tower and Drum tower===
A Bell Tower and a Drum Tower are arranged off the central axis. The Bell Tower houses a copper [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] cast in 1382, the bell is {{convert|2|m|adj=on}} tall, has a maximum diameter of {{convert|1.3|m|adj=on}}, and weighs {{convert|5000|kg|adj=on}}. The bell is used in the ''Evening Bell-Striking Ceremony'' conducted on New Year's Eve. Also situated off the main axis is a shrine to [[Ksitigarbha]] (Dizang the King Bodhissatva).

===Buddhist Texts Library===
The [[Buddhist Texts Library]] houses various versions of Buddhist [[sutra]]s and other Buddhist works, as well as ceremonial instruments, antiques, and artefacts.

Artworks in the temple include statues of the Maitreya Buddha in his [[Bodhisattva]] form and in his ''Cloth Bag Monk'' incarnation, statues of the [[Eighteen Arhats]] and 20 Guardians of Buddhist Law, as well as statues of the 500 [[arhat]]s.

===Longhua Pagoda===
[[Image:Longhuata300x400.jpg|right|thumb|Longhua Pagoda]]

The Longhua Pagoda is best well-known of the 16 historic pagodas that still stand within the Shanghai municipality. It has an octagonal floor layout. The size of the seven storeys decreases from the bottom to the top. The pagoda consists of a hollow, tube-like brick core surrounded by a wooden staircase. On the outside, it is decorated with balconies, banisters, and upturned eaves. These outer decorations have been reconstructed in keeping with the original style.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

Although previous pagodas existed on the same site, the current brick base and body of the pagoda was built in 977 under the [[Wuyue]] kingdome (907&amp;ndash;978), with continuous renovations of its more fragile wooden components on the exterior. Because of its age, the pagoda is fragile and is not open to the public.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

==Temple fair==
The Longhua Temple Fair has been held since the [[Ming dynasty]] annually on the third day of the third month of the [[Lunar Calendar]], when - according to local legend - the dragons visit the temple to help grant the people's wishes. It coincides with the blossoming of the peach trees in Longhua Park. Since its inception, the fair has been an annual event interrupted only by the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS]] outbreak.

==Location==
The Longhua Temple is located on the Longhua area (formerly Longhua township) of Shanghai (named after the temple). Its street address is No. 2853 Longhua Road (Longhua Lu). It is open to the public for a fee (10 [[Renminbi|RMB]]) which includes incense.{{Citation needed|reason=I didn't get any incense! (2 January 2010)|date=January 2010}}

==In popular culture==
[[J.G. Ballard]] in his World War II-era autobiographical novel ''[[Empire of the Sun]]'' describes the Japanese military use of the Longhua pagoda as a flak cannon tower.  In Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of the book, the pagoda is clearly visible above the prison camp.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

'''Low-latency queuing''' (LLQ) is a feature developed by [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] to bring strict [[priority queuing]] (PQ) to class-based [[weighted fair queuing]] (CBWFQ). LLQ allows delay-sensitive data (such as voice) to be given preferential treatment over other traffic by letting the data to be dequeued and sent first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_0t/12_0t7/feature/guide/pqcbwfq.html Low Latency Queueing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222112609/http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_0t/12_0t7/feature/guide/pqcbwfq.html |date=22 February 2009 }}, Cisco IOS Software Releases 12.0 T&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Class-based weighted fair queuing (CB-WFQ) was initially released without the support of a priority queuing system, thus it could not guarantee the delay and [[jitter]] (delay variation) requirements of real-time, interactive voice and video conversations. Since for CBWFQ, the weight for a [[Network packet|packet]] belonging to a specific class is derived from the [[Bandwidth_(computing)|bandwidth]] assigned to the class, which in turn determines the order in which packets are sent. All packets are serviced fairly based on weight and no class of packets may be granted strict priority. This scheme poses problems for voice traffic that is largely intolerant of delay, especially variation in delay.

In order to address this, Cisco released LLQ to provide strict priority queuing for CBWFQ by enabling the use of a single, strict priority queue within CBWFQ at the class level. This allows for directing traffic belonging to a class to the CBWFQ strict priority queue. One or more classes priority status can be given within a policy map. When multiple classes within a single policy map are configured as priority classes, all traffic from these classes is enqueued to the same single, strict priority queue.

'''Mechanical Engineering Technology''' is the application of engineering principles and technological developments for the creation of useful [[Product (business)|product]]s and production machinery.

==Technologists==
Mechanical engineering technologists are expected to apply current technologies and principles from machine and product design, production and material and manufacturing processes.

Expandable specialties may include aerospace, automotive, energy, nuclear, petroleum, manufacturing, product development, and [[industrial design]]. 

Mechanical engineering technologists can have many different titles, including in the United States: 
* Mechanical Engineering Technologist
* Mechanical Engineer 
* Product Engineering Technologist
* Mechanical Designer
* Product Development Engineering Technologist
* Manufacturing Engineering Technologist 

===Training===
Mechanical Engineering Technology coursework is less theoretical, and more application based than a [[mechanical engineering]] degree.  This is evident through the additional laboratory coursework required for a degree.  The ability to apply concepts from the [[chemical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]] fields is important. 

Some university Mechanical Engineering Technology degree programs require mathematics through [[differential equation]]s and [[statistics]].  Most courses involve algebra and calculus.

Oftentimes, a MET graduate could get hired as an engineer; job titles may include Mechanical Engineer and Manufacturing Engineer. In the U.S. it is possible to get an associates or bachelor's degree.  Individuals with a bachelor's degree in engineering technology may continue on to complete the E.I.T. (Engineer in Training) examination to eventually become Professional Engineers if the program is [[ABET]] accredited.

==Applications==
Software tools such as [[Finite Element Analysis]] (FEA) and [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) are often used to analyze parts and assemblies. 3D models can be made to represent parts and assemblies with [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software. 

Through the application of [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM), models may also be used directly by software to create "instructions" for the manufacture of objects represented by the models, through computer numerically controlled (CNC) machining or other automated processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10429">'''Multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance''' ('''MP-SPR''') is based on [[surface plasmon resonance]] (SPR), an established real-time label-free method for biomolecular interaction analysis,  but it uses a different optical setup, a goniometric SPR configuration. While MP-SPR provides same kinetic information as SPR ([[equilibrium constant]], [[dissociation constant]], [[Ligand (biochemistry)#Receptor.2Fligand binding affinity|association constant]]), it provides also structural information ([[refractive index]], layer thickness). Hence, MP-SPR measures both surface interactions and nanolayer properties.&lt;ref name="release" /&gt;

== History ==
The goniometric SPR method was researched alongside focused beam SPR and Otto configurations at [[VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland]] since 1980s by Dr. Janusz Sadowski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadowski|first1=J. W.|last2=Korhonen|first2=I.|last3=Peltonen|first3=J.|title=Characterization of thin films and their structures in surface plasmon resonance measurements|journal=Optical Engineering|date=1995|volume=34|issue=9|pages=2581–2586|bibcode=1995OptEn..34.2581S|doi=10.1117/12.208083}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goniometric SPR optics was commercialized by Biofons Oy for use in point-of-care applications. Introduction of additional measurement [[laser]] [[wavelength]]s and first [[thin film]] analyses were performed in 2011 giving way to MP-SPR method.

== Principle ==
The MP-SPR optical setup measures at multiple wavelengths simultaneously (similarly to spectroscopic SPR), but instead of measuring at a fixed angle, it rather scans across a wide range of θ angles (for instance 40 degrees). This results in measurements of full SPR curves at multiple wavelengths providing additional information about structure and [[Conformation activity relationship|dynamic conformation]] of the film.&lt;ref name="nanobiosensing" /&gt;

== Measured values ==
The measured full SPR curves (x-axis: angle, y-axis: reflected light intensity) can be transcribed into sensograms (x-axis: time, y-axis: selected parameter such as peak minimum, light intensity, peak width).&lt;ref name="cell" /&gt; The sensograms can be fitted using binding models to obtain kinetic parameters including on- and off-rates and affinity. The full SPR curves are used to fit [[Fresnel equations]] to obtain thickness and refractive index of the layers. Also due to the ability of scanning the whole SPR curve, MP-SPR is able to separate bulk effect and analyte binding from each other using parameters of the curve.

While [[QCM-D]] measures wet mass, MP-SPR and other optical methods measure dry mass, which enables analysis of water content of [[nanocellulose]] films.

== Applications ==
The method has been used in life sciences, material sciences and biosensor development.
In life sciences, the main applications focus on [[Drug development|pharmaceutical development]] including [[small-molecule]], antibody or [[nanoparticle]] interactions with [[Receptor (biochemistry)|target]] with a [[Biological membrane|biomembrane]]&lt;ref name="biomembranes" /&gt; or with a living cell monolayer.&lt;ref name="cell" /&gt; As first in the world, MP-SPR is able to separate [[Transcellular transport|transcellular]] and [[Paracellular transport|paracellular]] drug uptake&lt;ref name="cell" /&gt; in real-time and label-free for [[targeted drug delivery]].
In [[biosensor]] development, MP-SPR is used for assay development for point-of-care applications.&lt;ref name="nanobiosensing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biosensor2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="point-of-care" /&gt;&lt;ref name="printed biosensor" /&gt; Typical developed biosensors include [[Biosensor#Electrochemical|electrochemical]] printed biosensors, [[ELISA]] and [[Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy|SERS]].
In [[material science]]s, MP-SPR is used for optimization of thin solid films from Ångströms to 100 nanometers (graphene, metals, oxides), soft materials up to microns (nanocellulose, [[polyelectrolyte]]) including nanoparticles. Applications including [[Thin-film solar cell|thin film solar cells]], barrier coatings including [[anti-reflective coating]]s, [[antimicrobial surface]]s, [[self-cleaning glass]], [[plasmonic metamaterials]], [[Electro-switchable biosurface|electro-switching surfaces]], [[Layer by layer|layer-by-layer assembly]], and [[graphene]].&lt;ref name="graphene" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nanocellulose2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nanocellulose" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thickness" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14124">'''Network Centric Product Support (NCPS)''' is an early application of an [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) computer architecture developed to leverage new information technologies and global networks to assist in managing maintenance, support and supply chain of complex products made up of one or more complex systems, such as in a mobile aircraft fleet or fixed location assets such as in building systems. This is accomplished by establishing digital threads connecting the physical deployed subsystem with its design [[Digital Twins]] virtual model by embedding intelligence through networked micro-[[web servers]] that also function as a computer [[workstation]] within each subsystem component (i.e. [[Engine control unit]] on an aircraft) or other controller and enabling 2-way communications using existing [[Internet]] technologies and communications networks - thus allowing for the extension of a [[product lifecycle]] management (PLM) system into a mobile, deployed product at the subsystem level in real time. NCPS can be considered to be the support flip side of [[Network-centric warfare]], as this approach goes beyond traditional logistics and aftermarket support functions by taking a [[complex adaptive system]] management approach and integrating field maintenance and logistics in a unified factory and field environment. Its evolution began out of insights gained by CDR Dave Loda (USNR) from Network Centric Warfare-based fleet battle experimentation at the US Naval Warfare Development Command (NWDC) in the late 1990s, who later lead commercial research efforts of NCPS in aviation at United Technologies Corporation. Interaction with the MIT [[Auto-ID Labs]], [[EPCglobal]], the Air Transport Association of America [[ATA Spec 100/iSpec 2200]] and other consortium pioneering the emerging machine to machine [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) architecture contributed to the evolution of NCPS.

==Purpose==
Simply put, this architecture extends the existing World Wide Web infrastructure of networked web servers down into the product at its subsystem's controller level using a [[Systems engineering|Systems Engineering]] "system of systems" nested approach. Its core is an embedded dual function webserver/computer workstation connected to the product controller's test ports (as used in retrofit applications, or integrated directly into the controller for new products), hence providing access to operational cycles, sensor and other information in a clustered, internet addressable node that allows for local or remote access, and the ability to host remotely reconfigurable software that can collect and process data from its mated subsystem controller onboard and pull in other computing resources throughout the network. It can then establish a localized wireless World Wide Web in and around the product that can be securely connected to by a mechanic with any web browser-equipped handheld independent of the greater World Wide Web, as well as seamlessly integrate into global networks when external wireless communications is available - thus creating data [[Digital Twins]] at the factory, connecting deployed product usage in the [[Product lifecycle]] with constantly updated digital threads. This allows for an integrated approach which enables both offline and online updates to occur. Legacy systems usually require a human to physically connect a laptop to the system controller or a [[Telematics|telematic]] solution to manually collect data and carry it back to a location where it can be later transferred to the factory or to restricted webserver-based download sites for offboard analysis.

The architecture also enables communications with other micro-webservers in its [[Computer cluster]] (i.e. in an aircraft), or to higher level clusters (such as an internet portal managed fleet and flight operations managers), thus enabling access to data resources and personnel and factory engineers at remote office computers through the World Wide Web. As stated previously, the system operates asynchronously, in that it does not have to be always connected to the World Wide Web to function; rather it simply operates locally, then synchronizes two-way information relevant to the subsystem, acting as a [[Gateway (telecommunications)]] on board that connects with other gateways within the network, which can be airborne or on the ground, on an as-needed basis when communications is available. This can be accomplished through a [[Wireless LAN Network]], [[satellite]], [[cellular network]] or other wireless or wired communications capabilities.

Security of the network is critical, and the architecture can utilize standard web security protocols, from [[Public-key cryptography]] to embedded hardware encryption devices.

==Typical Usage==
The extension of the World Wide Web architecture into the product is important to understand, as all decisions for manufacturing of spare parts, scheduling for flights, and other factory OEM and airline operator functions, are driven primarily by what happens to the product in the field (rate of wear and impending failure, primarily). Predicting the rate of wear, and hence the impact on operations and forecasting for producing spare parts in the future, is critical for optimizing operations for all involved. Managing a complex system such as a fleet of aircraft, vehicles or fixed location products can be accomplished in this manner. For example, coupled with technologies such as [[RFID]], the system could track parts from the factory to the aircraft on board, then continue to read the configuration of the subsystem’s replaceable tagged parts, map their configuration to hours run and duty cycles, then process/communicate the projected wear rate through the World Wide Web back to the operator or factory. In this way mechanical wear rates and future failures can be predicted more accurately and the forecasting of spare parts manufacturing and shipment can be significantly improved. This is called [[Prognostics]] Health Monitoring (PHM), which has become possible in recent years with the advent of electronic controllers, and is a recent evolutionary step in aircraft support and maintenance management that began as individual processes prior to World War II and solidified into a manual tracking system to support aircraft fleets in the Korean War. Support for the mechanic comes in local wireless access to technical information stored and remotely updated on board the micro-webserver component relevant to that product, such as service bulletins, factory updates, fault code driven, intelligent 3D computer game-like maintenance procedures, and social media applications for sharing of product issues and maintenance procedure improvements in the field to include collaborative 2-way voice, text and image communications. Note that this architecture can be utilized on any system that requires monitoring and trending, to include mobile medical applications for monitoring functionality of human systems when the subject is equipped with data sensors.

==Background and Other Examples==
The original micro-webserver component (i. e. the onboard unit) that is key to enabling the NCPS architecture was first prototyped and demonstrated in 2001 by David Loda, Enzo Macchia, Sam Quadri and Bjorn Stickling at United Technologies' Pratt &amp; Whitney division and initially tested on board a [[Fairchild-Dornier 328]] (later AvCraft 328) regional jet in January 2002. It was introduced to the public and demonstrated at the [[Farnborough Airshow|Farnborough Air Show]] in July 2002 in prototype form and again in 2004 as a flight certified product offering marketed by United Technologies as the DTU and later FAST data management units for service in a number of aircraft and helicopter fleets.

A similar complex systems approach in a completely different application is successfully embodied in the Eisenhower [[Interstate Highway System]], though what is transported in NCPS is information, not cars and trucks. Network Centric Product Support, or net-centric product support, is an architectural concept, and merely connects the major avenues already existing in global communications and the internet down into the mobile product, extending maintenance and supply chain processes into an integrated product centric system with a real time [[Feedback|feedback loop]] to the designers, factory and maintainers as to product performance and reliability. For example, to gain information about a particular engine on a mobile aircraft, it is most efficient to send the inquiry to the engine directly and host all information generated and relevant to that system there, as well synchronize in a twin remote database for access and queuing when the engine system is not in communications. Other examples where this can be applied include shipping containers, automobiles, spacecraft, appliances, human medical monitoring, or any other complex product with sensors and subsystems that require maintenance support and monitoring.

Many organizations are beginning to see the value of a [[netcentric]] (also spelled "net-centric") approach to managing complex systems, including the [[Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium]] (NCOIC), which is an association of leading aerospace and defense contractors in the Network Centric Warfare arena. Network Centric thinking for aircraft operations, including Network Enabled Operations (NEO) demonstrations, also figure prominently in the commercial [[Next Generation Air Transportation System]] (NextGen) approach being made by the US Government to revamping air transportation management in the 21st Century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8101">'''New Source Performance Standards''' ('''NSPS''') are pollution control [[Technical standard|standards]] issued by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).  The term is used in the [[Clean Air Act (1970)|Clean Air Act Extension of 1970]] (CAA) to refer to [[air pollution]] emission standards, and in the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) referring to standards for [[water pollution]] discharges of [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] to [[surface water]]s.

== Introduction ==
Some pollution control laws are organized with varying degrees of stringency. The different standards may be based on several factors, including whether the pollution source is an existing facility at the time the standard is published, or is constructed after publication. The standards for new sources may be more stringent than that for existing facilities, on the principle that a new plant can be designed with the latest and most advanced control technologies.&lt;ref name=carruth&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carruth |first1=Russellyn S. |last2=Goldstein |first2=Bernard D. |date=2013 |title=Environmental Health Law: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXhjAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT82 |chapter=Defining New Sources |publisher=John Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=9781118420874}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82-83}}

== Clean Air Act ==
The Clean Air Act NSPS dictate the level of pollution that a new [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stationary source]] may produce. These standards are authorized by Section 111 of the CAA&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Air Act, section 111, {{USC|42|7411}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the regulations are published in [[Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations|40 CFR]] Part 60.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). "Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; NSPS have been established for a number of individual industrial or source categories. Examples:
* Air emissions from chemical manufacturing wastewater&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nsps/socww/socwwpg.html |title=Rule and Implementation Information for Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources–Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry Wastewater |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-02-23 |website=Air Toxics |publisher=EPA}} 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart YYY.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Boilers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nsps/boilernsps/boilernsps.html |title=Rule and Implementation Information for New Source Performance Standards for Boilers (Steam Generating Units) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-02-23 |website=Air Toxics |publisher=EPA}} 40 CFR Part 60, Subparts D-Dc.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Landfills&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/atw/landfill/landflpg.html |title=Rule and Implementation Information for Standards of Performance for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-02-23 |website=Air Toxics |publisher=EPA}} 40 CFR Part 60, Subparts Cc and WWW.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Petroleum refineries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nsps/petrefnsps/petrefnspspg.html |title=Rule Information for Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources–Petroleum Refineries |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-02-23 |website=Air Toxics |publisher=EPA}} 40 CFR Part 60, Subparts J &amp; Ja.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stationary gas turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nsps/turbine/turbnsps.html |title=Rule and Implementation Information–New Source Performance Standards for Stationary Gas Turbines |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-02-23 |website=Air Toxics |publisher=EPA}} 40 CFR part 60, Subpart GG.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic process for establishing standards===
#Identify type of emitting facility.
#For each type of facility, identify the type of pollutant control technology that is appropriate.
#From a study of all the plants and all the information available about the plants and their technologies, establish an allowed concentration of the [[criteria pollutants]] that is the upper limit of what can be emitted.&lt;ref name=carruth /&gt;{{rp|84-85}}

== Clean Water Act ==
Under the Clean Water Act, NSPS set the level of allowable wastewater discharges from new industrial facilities. EPA issues NSPS for categories of industrial dischargers, typically in conjunction with the issuance of [[effluent guidelines]] for existing sources. In developing NSPS, the CWA requires that EPA determine the "best available demonstrated control technology" (BADCT) for the particular industrial category. BADCT may be more stringent than the [[best available technology|best available technology economically achievable]] standard used for existing dischargers. This consideration may include setting a "no discharge of pollutants standard" (also called a "zero discharge" standard) if practicable.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Clean Water Act, section 306(a), {{USCSub|33|1316|a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/learn-about-effluent-guidelines |title=Learn About Effluent Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-01-29 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSPS regulations are published at [[Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations|40 CFR]] Subchapter N (Parts 405-499). NSPS issued by EPA include the following categories:
* Coal Mining&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Coal Mining Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|434}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dairy Products&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Dairy Products Processing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|405}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inorganic Chemicals Manufacturing (including a zero discharge requirement for several subcategories)&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Inorganic Chemicals Manufacturing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|415}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Iron and Steel Manufacturing&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Iron and Steel Manufacturing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Oil and Gas Extraction&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|435}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Petroleum Refining&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Petroleum Refining Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|419}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pulp, Paper and Paperboard&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Pulp, Paper and Paperboard Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|430}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sugar Processing (including a zero discharge requirement for one subcategory)&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Sugar Processing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|409}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Textile Mills.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Textile Mills Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|410}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA has published a general definition of "new source" in the federal wastewater permit regulations.&lt;ref&gt;
"EPA Administered Permit Programs: The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|122.2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More specialized definitions of "new source" are included in some of the individual category regulations, e.g., the definition for the Pulp, Paper and Paperboard category.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Pulp, Paper and Paperboard Point Source Category. ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|430.01}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noctcaelador''' (from [[Latin]] ''nocturnus'' – nocturnal, ''caelum'' – sky and ''adorare'' – to adore&lt;ref name="questia"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-175442997/academic-orientation-academic-achievement-and-noctcaelador| title =Academic Orientation, Academic Achievement, and Noctcaelador: Does Interest in Night-Sky Watching Correlate with Students' Approach to the Academic Environment?  |publisher =[[Questia]]| author=Kelly, William E.| author2=Daughtry, Don|accessdate =10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[psychological]] construct, introduced by the psychologist [[William E. Kelly]] in 2003 to describe an "emotional attachment to, or adoration of, the [[night sky]]".&lt;ref name="questia"/&gt;

According to Kelly, "noctcaelador has been associated with higher openness to experience, investigative and artistic vocational interests, sensation-seeking, a rational, cognitive approach to problem solving and need for cognition, a propensity to engage in fantasy, a tendency to become deeply involved and attentive to stimuli of interest, and a willingness to consider unusual ideas and possibilities".&lt;ref name="questia"/&gt;

==History==
In a series of lectures in the United States, the philosopher [[George Santayana]] used the appearance of the night sky as an example of what is attractive to the human mind: an intricacy delicately poised between unfathomable complexity and uninteresting simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Barrow| first =John| title =The Artful Universe Expanded| publisher =[[Oxford University Press]]| date =2011 | page =&lt;!-- pages aren't numbered --&gt; | isbn =0191615838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the absence of light pollution in antiquity, stars of the sixth [[apparent magnitude]] were more widely visible by the naked eye. American philosopher [[Holmes Rolston III]] juxtaposed the ancient [[aesthetics]] of the night sky and the modern one: "Today, we are almost amused at the way the ancients fancied various [[constellation]]s there. At night, we no longer admire the [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] as a hunter, any more than by day do we admire a [[cumulus cloud]] as a basket of washing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hrolston/Celestial-aesthetics.pdf| title =Celestial Aesthetics: Over Our Heads and/or in Our Heads |author=Holmes Rolston III|publisher =[[Colorado State University]]|page=5|date=2011| accessdate =10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Asimov]] in his short story ''[[Nightfall (Asimov short story and novel)|Nightfall]]'' (1941) tackled the first experience of the night sky by describing an [[eclipse]] on a fictitious inhabited planet with six suns.

This is a list of tables of the '''oldest people''' in the world in ordinal ranks. To avoid including [[Longevity claims|false or unconfirmed claims of extreme old age]], names here are restricted to those people whose ages have been validated by an international body that specifically deals in longevity research, such as the [[Gerontology Research Group]] (GRG) or ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' (GWR), and others who have otherwise been [[WP:RS|reliably sourced]].

According to this criterion, the longest human lifespan is that of [[Jeanne Calment]] of [[France]] (1875–1997), who lived to the age of 122 years, 164 days. She met [[Vincent van Gogh]] when she was 12 or 13.&lt;ref name="Calment"&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitney |first=Craig R. |date=5 August 1997 |title=Jeanne Calment, World's Elder, Dies at 122 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7D7113DF936A3575BC0A961958260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received news media attention in 1985, after turning 110. Subsequent investigation found documentation for Calment's age, beyond any reasonable question, in the records of her native city, [[Arles]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authors=[[Jean-Marie Robine|Robine, Jean-Marie]]; Allard, Michel |year=1999 |title=Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life|url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09.htm|location=Odense |publisher=[[University Press of Southern Denmark]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More evidence of Calment's lifespan has been produced than for any other supercentenarian, such that her case serves as an archetype in the methodology for verifying the ages of the world's oldest people.&lt;ref name="Calmentthoroughly"&gt;{{cite web |last=Shaw |first=Michael D. |date=1 December 2008 |title=You Say You Want to Live for a Long Time? |url=http://www.gasdetection.com/news2/health_news_digest184.html |publisher=Health News Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Life_expectancy#Sex_differences|women live longer than men on average]], combined records for both sexes are predominated by women. The longest undisputed lifespan for a man is that of [[Jiroemon Kimura]] of [[Japan]] (1897–2013), who died at age 116 years, 54 days.

Since the death of 117-year-old Chiyo Miyako of Japan on 22 July 2018, 115-year-old [[Kane Tanaka]], also of Japan, born 2 January 1903, is the oldest living person in the world whose age has been documented. Since the death of 113-year-old [[List of Spanish supercentenarians#Francisco Núñez Olivera|Francisco Núñez Olivera]] of Spain on 29 January 2018, 113-year-old [[List of Japanese supercentenarians#Masazō Nonaka|Masazō Nonaka]] of Japan, born 25 July 1905, is the world's oldest verified living man.

Systematic verification of longevity has only been practiced in recent decades and only in certain parts of the world. All ten of these people are women.

'''Oral Roberts University''' ('''ORU'''), based in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in the United States, is an interdenominational, Christian, comprehensive [[liberal arts university]] with 4,000 students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?id=717|title=News - Oral Roberts University - A Christian College, based in Tulsa Oklahoma.|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncahlc.org/index.php?option=com_directory&amp;Itemid=192&amp;Action=ShowBasic&amp;instid=1634|title=Higher Learning Commission|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1963,  the university is named after its founder, [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Oral Roberts]], and accredited by the [[Higher Learning Commission]].

The school fronts on South Lewis Avenue between East 75th Street and East 81st Street in South Tulsa. Sitting on a {{convert|263|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus, ORU offers over 65 undergraduate degree programs along with a number of masters and doctoral degrees.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/facts_about_oru/ |title=Facts about ORU - Oral Roberts University - A Christian College, based in Tulsa Oklahoma |publisher=Oru.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/12/15/oral.roberts/index.html | work=CNN | title=Evangelist Oral Roberts dead at 91 - CNN.com | accessdate=2010-05-20 | date=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncahlc.org/component/option,com_directory/Action,ShowBasic/Itemid,192/instid,1634/lang,en/ |title=The Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association |publisher=Ncahlc.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605194342/http://www.ncahlc.org/component/option,com_directory/Action,ShowBasic/Itemid,192/instid,1634/lang,en/ |archive-date=2011-06-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ORU is classified as a Master's University by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/lookup_listings/view_institution.php?unit_id=207582&amp;start_page=institution.php&amp;clq=%7B%22first_letter%22%3A%22O%22%7D |title=Carnegie Classifications &amp;#124; Institution Profile |publisher=Classifications.carnegiefoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ORU was also ranked as one of 123 institutions in the 2012 "Best in the West" regional list produced by ''[[The Princeton Review]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Education ==
[[Image:Christ's Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|Christ's Chapel as seen from the gardens surrounding the Prayer Tower.]]

ORU offers [[undergraduate]] programs in [[theology]], [[business]], [[music]], [[communication design|communication arts]], [[modern languages]], [[behavioral sciences]], [[graphics]], [[education]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[computer science]], [[mathematical science]], [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[English studies|English]], [[history]], [[humanities]], [[government]] and [[nursing]]. The university also has a graduate [[seminary]] and fully accredited graduate programs in Business and Education.

Students in the College of Science and Engineering with a GPA of 3.4 or higher have an 86% medical school acceptance rate and 75% dental school acceptance rate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/academics/college_of_science_and_engineering/pre_med.php|title=Pre-Medical - Oral Roberts University - A Christian College, based in Tulsa Oklahoma.|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ORU students have been accepted into more than 70 medical schools nationally, including [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Washington University]], and [[Duke University]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Because of the high acceptance rates for medicine, ORU signed an early assurance program with [[Oklahoma State University]] college of Osteopathic Medicine in 2011, allowing high achieving students to receive conditional admission to OSU's medical school program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/oru_news/20110822_oru_osu_medical.php|title=ORU/OSU Center for Health Sciences help grads enter medical school  - Oral Roberts University - A Christian College, based in Tulsa Oklahoma.|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ORU is also one of the few undergraduate colleges in the southwest to have a human cadaver dissection class. While ORU is considered a Christian University, the College of Science and Engineering does not ignore evolutionary theories to teach [[Creationism]].

ORU is fully accredited by the [[The Higher Learning Commission|Higher Learning Commission]], one of two commission members of the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA), which was founded in 1895 as one of six regional institutional accreditors in the United States. A major distinction of ORU is its high number of additional specialized program accreditations, especially for a university of its size. The following is a list of the academic colleges with the recognition of specialized accreditation, along with the name of the accrediting body.

== History ==
[[Image:Praying Hands at the main entrance to the campus of Oral Roberts University.jpg|thumb|Main entrance to campus and The Billy Joe Daugherty Circle]]
The university was founded by [[Oral Roberts]] in 1965 "as a result of the evangelist Oral Roberts' obeying [[God in Christianity|God’s]] mandate to build a university on God’s authority and the [[Holy Spirit]]. God’s commission to Oral Roberts was to 'Raise up your students to hear My voice, to go where My light is dim, where My voice is heard small, and My healing power is not known, even to the uttermost bounds of the earth. Their work will exceed yours, and in this I am well pleased'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orugoldeneagles.com/downloads2/391722.pdf?ATCLID=1335882&amp;SPSID=87170&amp;SPID=10340&amp;DB_OEM_ID=17000|title=ORU Table of Contents (PDF)|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first students enrolled in 1965.

The school was accredited in 1971 by the [[Higher Learning Commission]] of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://admissions.oru.edu/accreditationfacts.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004184134/http://admissions.oru.edu/accreditationfacts.html |date=October 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also accredited by the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ats.edu/member_schools/oralrobt.asp Member Schools&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407101739/http://www.ats.edu/member_schools/oralrobt.asp |date=2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oral Roberts' son [[Richard Roberts (evangelist)|Richard]] was named president in 1993. In October 2007 the younger Roberts took a leave of absence, citing a lawsuit filed by former ORU professors; he resigned the following month. Oral Roberts emerged from retirement to take over as interim president of the university, and Tulsa evangelist [[Billy Joe Daugherty]] was named executive regent.

That same month, the school was reportedly "struggling financially" with over $50 million in debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/24/AR2007102402111.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103172655/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/24/AR2007102402111.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=November 3, 2012 | title=Chairman Says ORU Over $50M in Debt | publisher=The Washington Post | date= October 24, 2007| first= | last=  | accessdate = 2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ORU's operating budget for 2007-2008 was more than $82 million. However, in the second quarter of 2009, the university's debt was reduced to $720,000 as of result of a number of simultaneous efforts including a $70 million gift from the [[Mart Green]] family, owners of [[Oklahoma City]]-based [[Hobby Lobby]], and the $25 Million Dollar Matching Campaign, a part of the university's Renewing the Vision effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?site=oru&amp;id=1058 |title=News Stories - Oral Roberts University - A Christian College, based in Tulsa Oklahoma |publisher=Oru.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23, 2009, it was announced at the end of the university's chapel service that all of the university's long-term debt obligations had been met and the school was debt-free.&lt;ref name="debt-free"&gt;Justin Juozapavicius, [http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_ORAL_ROBERTS_DEBT?SITE=OKTUL&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT "Oral Roberts says it's debt-free after scandal"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Associated Press]]'', September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the university's presidential search committee recommended [[Mark Rutland]], President of [[Southeastern University of the Assemblies of God]] in Florida, to officially succeed Richard Roberts, which the Board of Trustees approved. Rutland took office on July 1, 2009 as the third president.&lt;ref name="takesoffice"&gt;Shannon Muchmore, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20090701_11_0_TULSAO908452 "Oral Roberts University president takes office"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', July 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1963–2007 ===
Ground was officially broken for Oral Roberts' university in 1962 in the southern part of the city of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The university received its charter the following year in 1963 from the State of Oklahoma and Oral Roberts University officially opened in 1965 with an enrollment of 300 students and with seven major completed buildings.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"&gt;[http://www.dingman.com/oru_history.pdf "History of Oral Roberts University"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821223800/http://www.dingman.com/oru_history.pdf |date=2010-08-21 }} ''[[Dingman.com]]'' (Tulsa, OK.), May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Oral Roberts placed special importance on the [[Prayer Tower]], even though the concept of a building specifically dedicated to prayer located at the center of the campus caused some considerable tension, as some academic leaders were afraid the school would be unable to receive accreditation with such a building. However, the tower, designed by architect [[Frank Wallace (architect)|Frank Wallace]], was completed in 1967 at a cost of two million dollars, a further source of contention. After the tower's completion, Roberts called for a three-day period of prayer and fasting.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"/&gt; At the university's dedication ceremony in 1967, the evangelist [[Billy Graham]] was the keynote speaker.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"/&gt;

The first partial graduation took place in 1968 and the first full graduation in 1969.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"/&gt; In 1971, Roberts announced to the student body that Oral Roberts University had been fully [[accreditation|accredited]] for ten years by the North Central Association, to which the students responded by lifting Roberts off the stage and carrying him around the outdoor assembly amid the cheers of supporters.

During the first decade of the school's existence, enrollment increased at a rapid pace; also during this time, many of the campus' iconic structures were completed, such as the Howard Auditorium, the Graduate Center, the Mabee Center, and Christ's Chapel among others.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"/&gt;

The university built the [[CityPlex Towers|City of Faith Medical and Research Center]] hospital, which opened in 1981, and started the Oral Roberts University School of Medicine in 1978,  but severe financial difficulties with both of these institutions led to their closure in 1989.

The [[O. W. Coburn School of Law]] opened in 1979. In 1986 the university "shut down its ailing law school and sent its library to [[Pat Robertson]]'s Bible-based college in Virginia", which subsequently founded the [[Regent University|Regent University School of Law]].&lt;ref name="Scandalspotlight"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/04/08/scandal_puts_spotlight_on_christian_law_school/?page=full | title=Scandal puts spotlight on Christian law school| publisher=Boston Globe | date= April 8, 2007| first=Charlie | last=Savage  | accessdate = 2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Golden Eagle Broadcasting ====
{{Main|Golden Eagle Broadcasting}}
In January 1996 Golden Eagle Broadcasting, a small digital satellite Christian and family programming television network owned and operated by Oral Roberts University, was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/oru_news/20100623_geb_signs_distribution_deal_with_directv.php|title=ORU’s Golden Eagle Broadcasting Signs Distribution Deal with DIRECTV|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming includes the Oral Roberts University Chapel Service, called ''The Gathering,'' ORU sports, and other Christian programs not associated with ORU.

=== 2007 ===

{{wikinews|Oral Roberts University president accused of illegal political donations and financial misappropriation}}
In October 2007, a lawsuit was filed in Tulsa County by three former professors who claimed to have been wrongfully terminated. They also alleged university president Richard Roberts misused university assets and illegally ordered the university to participate in Republican candidate Randi Miller's political campaign for Tulsa mayor. This occurred while the tax-exempt university was working lawfully with the [[Republican National Committee]] on out-of-state projects as part of a long-standing, pre-approved curriculum that had been in place for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.com/subscribe/login?url=/daily/2007/10/2007100303n.htm |title=3 Former Professors Sue Oral Roberts U., |accessdate=2007-09-24 |author=  |date=October 4, 2007 |publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2007/pdfs/Swails_vs_ORU.pdf |title=Swails, Brooker, Brooker v.

Lindsay Roberts, who is referred to in ORU publicity as the university's "first lady," is accused of spending tens of thousands of dollars of university funds on clothes, awarding nonacademic [[scholarship]]s to the children of family friends and sending text messages, mostly sent between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., on university-issued cell phones to people described in the lawsuit as "underage males."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The lawsuit also alleges a longtime maintenance employee was fired for the purpose of giving the job to an underage male friend of Lindsay Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2007/pdfs/Swails_vs_ORU.pdf |title=Swails, Brooker, Brooker v.

Richard Roberts told students during his weekly chapel, "This lawsuit ...is about intimidation, blackmail and extortion." Former ORU professor and lawsuit plaintiff Tim Brooker commented, "All over that campus there are signs up that say, 'And God said, build me a university, build it on my authority, and build it on the Holy Spirit.' Unfortunately, ownership has shifted."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100501436.html Scandal Brewing at Oral Roberts]'', 6 October 2007, retrieved 8 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Church of Christ]] minister [[Carlton Pearson]], a former protege of Oral Roberts, said Richard Roberts was "born into privilege... What others may call extravagance he may not see it as extravagant." According to CNN, Pearson said he was disappointed but not surprised by the allegations, explaining, "These kinds of things are common among family-owned and operated businesses and ministries. They don't cross every T and dot every I."&lt;ref&gt;CNN, ''[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/law/10/10/oru.suit/?iref=mpstoryview Oral Roberts' son denies he misspent school funds]'', 10 October 2007, retrieved 10 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, the plaintiffs filed an amended lawsuit adding the university's Board of Regents (Oral and Richard Roberts, along with [[George Pearsons]], [[Kenneth Copeland]], [[Creflo Dollar]], [[Michael Armand Hammer|Michael A. Hammer]], [[John Hagee]], [[Marilyn Hickey]], [[Jerry Savelle]] and [[Charlie Watson|Charles Watson]]) to the suit and alleging three days after the original lawsuit was filed, Roberts fired the university's financial comptroller (who had been employed by ORU for 26 years) and "witnesses have reported voluminous materials and documents were shredded and destroyed, constituting spoilation of evidence." The filing also alleged Lindsay Roberts had spent at least nine nights in the ORU guest house with an underage 16-year-old male who also was allowed to live in the Roberts family residence on campus, a situation that made their oldest daughter so uncomfortable, she insisted deadbolt locks be installed on all bedroom doors in the house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2007/pdfs/orusuit.pdf Online copy of revised Swails lawsuit against ORU, October 12th, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations against me in a lawsuit yesterday are not true. They sicken me to my soul."

==== Resignation of Richard Roberts ====
{{wikinews|Richard Roberts takes leave of absence from Oral Roberts University}}
On October 17, 2007, Richard Roberts announced a "temporary leave of absence" as president of the university, citing the "toll" the lawsuit and attendant allegations have taken on him and his family. Billy Joe Daugherty became Executive Regent of the Board of Regents and Interim President. Chairman of the Board [[George Pearsons]] noted the temporary resignation was not an admission of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Tulsa World, ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071018_1_A1_hTheO62814 Roberts takes ORU leave]'', 17 October 2007, retrieved 18 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, former board of regents member Harry McNevin claimed that during the 1980s, the ORU Board of Regents "rubber-stamped" the "use of millions in endowment money to buy a Beverly Hills property so Oral Roberts could have a West Coast office and house."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; McNevin also said a country club membership was purchased for Oral Roberts' home. "His idea was if he could get on the golf course with these people, he could get donations for the university," said McNevin. These lavish expenses led McNevin to resign from the board in 1987.

In a wrongful termination lawsuit filed against the university on November 21, 2007, former ORU senior accountant Trent Huddleston claimed he had been ordered to help Roberts and his wife "cook the books" by misclassifying nearly $123,000 in funds allegedly spent by the university on remodeling the Roberts home.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Juozapavicius, November 21, 2007, "[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9XJtq8scoszIFZLWUjrR8mPuBFQD8T2BTUO0 Oral Roberts Accountant Sues Over Firing]," Associated Press. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128061040/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9XJtq8scoszIFZLWUjrR8mPuBFQD8T2BTUO0 |date=November 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|Oral Roberts calls 'emergency meeting'}}
On November 13, the tenured faculty of Oral Roberts University approved by a simple majority a non-binding vote of no confidence in Richard Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;AP, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/education/14oral.html Faculty Opposes Oral Roberts President]'' 13 November 2007, retrieved 15 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts tendered his letter of resignation to the university's board of regents on November 23, effective immediately. In a prepared email statement released by the university, he said, "I love ORU with all my heart. I love the students, faculty, staff and administration and I want to see God's best for all of them." The regents said they would meet the following week to discuss the search for a new president. Executive regent Billy Joe Daugherty continued as interim president (working with chancellor Oral Roberts).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071124_1_A1_hMove11578 Roberts resigns]&lt;/ref&gt;

"You can't take the sacrifices of God's people and use them any old way," McNevin commented after Roberts' resignation. "It's been 20 years that they've been doing the same things that I became aware of."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/11/23/national/a165630S41.DTL Embattled Oral Roberts President Resigns]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aftermath ====
On November 27, Pearsons said the university planned to separate its finances and leadership from the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, to the apparent approval of many students and faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;AP, Justin Juozapavicius, ''[http://apnews.myway.com/article/20071129/D8T75O201.html Roberts Says God Forced His Resignation]'', 29 November 2007, retrieved 29 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 January 2008 ORU settled with lawsuit plaintiff John Swails who was reinstated to his previous teaching position.&lt;ref&gt;Marciszewski, April, ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080111_1_A1_hThel03342 ORU reinstates one professor]'', tulsworld.com, 11 January 2008, retrieved 13 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080502/ap_on_re_us/oral_roberts_scandal ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503141315/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080502/ap_on_re_us/oral_roberts_scandal |date=May 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school also announced a formal search committee for a new president, to be headed by board of regents member and Tulsa resident Glenda Payas.&lt;ref&gt;Marciszewski, April, ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080110_1_A9_spanc51273 ORU regent to lead committee structuring presidential search]'', tulsworld.com, 10 January 2008, retrieved 13 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008–present ===
On January 14, 2008, Oral Roberts University’s board of regents voted unanimously to accept $62 million from the [[Mart Green]] family, founders of [[Hobby Lobby]] and Mardel educational and Christian supply stores. In late October, an ORU spokesman had said ORU was $52.5 million in debt and the school accepted an unconditional $8 million from the Greens in late November. ORU’s board of regents has been replaced with a 23-member board of trustees all initially named by the Greens, with Mart Green as chairman. Although Green said in November, two family members would sit on the board, he will reportedly be the only one. Green said he wanted to be involved in ORU because his family “felt like financial stewardship needed to be shored up.” &lt;ref&gt;Marciszewski, April, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080115_1__hThea88026 "$62 million for ORU,"] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', 15 January 2008, retrieved 16 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Campus renovations and layoffs ====

Of the $82 million given to Oral Roberts University, around half went toward eliminating the university's $52 million debt. The remaining $32 million was allocated to, "campus renovations, technology upgrades, academic enhancement, financial aid for new and returning students, marketing and operations," according to the university website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?id=821|title=Renewing the Vision|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 2008, $10 million went toward campus upgrades and deferred maintenance. Many of the dormitories on campus received extensive renovations and most of the campus's other buildings received much needed restoration and upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?intNav=news&amp;id=916|title="Summer Renovations Recap 2008,"|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Prayer Tower on the campus of Oral Roberts University.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Prayer Tower]].]]

In January 2009, the University began to implement the employment reduction plans announced in November 2008, laying off 53 employees and cutting about 40 unfilled positions. According to university sources, these layoffs come as the administration and Board of Trustees seeks long-term financial viability for the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=298&amp;articleid=20090113_330_0_ORUemp571078 "ORU cuts positions, 53 laid off,"] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', January 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2009, it was announced that the Green family would commit an additional $10.4 million to go toward additional campus renovations and upgrades to take place during summer 2009.&lt;ref name="oru.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?id=991&amp;intNav=|title=Green Family Commits $10 million for Summer Renovations,|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the gift, Mart Green, who is chair of ORU's board of trustees, said, "This gift will help to improve the quality of education for students at the new ORU. Our family is excited to continue partnering with ORU financially to ensure this great university continues to provide an excellent, whole-person education." &lt;ref name="oru.edu"/&gt;

==== ''Renewing the Vision'' campaign ====
Following Mart Green's contribution, the university's debt was reduced to $25 million. In February 2008, the Renewing the Vision campaign was initiated in an effort to erase this debt. To free the university from its burgeoning debt, the Board of Trustees announced plans for a $25 million matching campaign,&lt;ref name="Renewing the Vision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?id=821|title=Renewing the Vision,|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Board agreed that it would match dollar-for-dollar all that was donated to the university as part of the Renewing the Vision campaign, up to a maximum of $25 million. ORU Interim President Ralph Fagin stated, "The goal is in one year to get the debt down. It is a pretty audacious goal. It is a faith goal."&lt;ref name="Renewing the Vision"/&gt; In addition to eliminating the debt, funds from the Renewing the Vision campaign contributed to the 2008 summer campus renovations as well as scholarships provided by the university.&lt;ref name="Renewing the Vision"/&gt; As of June 3, 2009, donations and pledges had reduced the university's original $50 million debt to $720,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webapps.oru.edu/secure/alumniweb/renewingthevision_bf.php|title=Renewing the Vision,|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2009, a $1 million donation was made to the school's Whole Person Scholarship fund by Chairman of the Armand Hammer Foundation and university trustee [[Michael Armand Hammer]], son of Julian Armand Hammer and grandson of the late industrialist [[Armand Hammer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1999_Sept_1/ai_55623393/|title=Oklahoma: Trustee gives $1 million to ORU scholarship fund|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammer's donation will be matched twice and, in the end, will amount to a $4 million donation to the university. The donation will contribute to a new scholarship initiative that seeks to find potential students who are well-rounded and already exhibit the characteristics of a person who is spiritually alive, intellectually alert, physically disciplined, and socially adept. The Whole Person Scholarship provides scholarships that vary from full-tuition down to $2,500 to students who meet the aforementioned criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wholeperson.oru.edu/purpose.php|title=Whole Person Scholarship|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312082556/http://wholeperson.oru.edu/purpose.php|archivedate=12 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Presidential inauguration of Mark Rutland and debt-free status ====
In January 2009, it was reported that ORU had selected a new president: [[Mark Rutland]], president of [[Southeastern University of the Assemblies of God|Southeastern University]] in [[Lakeland, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Shannon Muchmore, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=298&amp;articleid=20090114_296_0_OralRo301798 "ORU has candidate for president,"] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', January 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, Rutland confirmed that he had been offered the position, and intended to accept it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20090114/NEWS/901140413/1410?Title=Oral_Roberts_Courts_Southeastern_s_Rutland|title=Oral Robert Courts Southeastern's Rutland,|work=TheLedger.com|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rutland was formally announced as the new president on January 28, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon Muchmore, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20090129_11_A9_MarkRu182765  "New ORU president named,"] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  He officially took office on July 1, 2009.&lt;ref name="takesoffice" /&gt;

On September 23, 2009, at the university's twice-per-week chapel service, President Mark Rutland announced that all of the university's long-term debt obligations had been met and the school was now debt-free.&lt;ref name="hosted.ap.org"&gt;Justin Juozapavicius [http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_ORAL_ROBERTS_DEBT?SITE=OKTUL&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT "Oral Roberts says it's debt-free after scandal"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[Associated Press]], September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Rutland had indicated in an interview earlier in the year that he had expected the announcement for quite some time and that he could have paid the debt down when he took office in July, "But that's like making a hole in one with nobody on the golf course." He told the Associated Press, "So, we're going to wait until school starts ... and then we'll have a 'ta-dah' moment."

About the erasing of the university's debt, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Mart Green said, "We are extremely thankful to all the donors who stepped up to support ORU. They know the value of this university and they can see the product that ORU produces – excellent, whole-person graduates who are valuable to this community and to the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/oru_news/20090923_oru_eliminates_longterm_debt.php|title=Free at Last: Oral Roberts University Eliminates Long-term Debt|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donations from alumni contributed heavily to the university becoming free: prior to the 2007 scandal, less than 6 percent of alumni donated to the university; however, as a result of the ''Renewing the Vision'' campaign, donations from alumni rose from $763,000 in 2007 to $2.3 million in 2009.&lt;ref name="hosted.ap.org"/&gt;

[[Governor of Oklahoma|Governor]] [[Brad Henry]] declared September 25, 2009, "Dr. Mark Rutland Day".

In December 2010, ORU announced that the Green family would make another $10 million gift in 2011, to be used for renovations and technology improvements.  The gift raised the Greens' total donations to $110 million.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Sherman, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=19&amp;articleid=20101217_11_0_TheGre168553 "ORU receives another $10 million donation"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', December 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2013, ORU announced that [[Billy Wilson (pastor)|William "Billy" Wilson]], executive director of the International Center for Spiritual Renewal and vice-chair of the ORU board of trustees, had been selected to succeed Rutland as president, effective on July 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Leclaire, [http://www.charismanews.com/us/38055-oru-names-billy-wilson-as-fourth-president " ORU Names Billy Wilson as Fourth President"], ''[[Charisma (magazine)|Charisma News]]'', January 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  A day earlier, the ORU student newspaper had briefly posted an erroneous report on its website, mistakenly identifying a different person as the new president. Rutland criticized the report at a student assembly and the newspaper's longtime faculty adviser left the school the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Paluka, [https://archive.is/20130216021409/http://www.fox23.com/mostpopular/story/ORU-professors-exit-causing-stir-on-campus/ChbU85RFZEyMoHxPa_vtsg.cspx "ORU professor's exit causing stir on campus"], [[KOKI-TV]], January 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus was built beginning in 1963 with a noted [[Futurist architecture|futuristic]] look and architecture. Architects Stanfield, Imel &amp; Walton of Tulsa designed the 1963 master plan but most of the buildings were designed by Tulsa architect Frank Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsahistory.org/events/deco_tours.htm Tulsa Historical Society Art Deco Tours 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704182647/http://www.tulsahistory.org/events/deco_tours.htm |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed in 2010, Wallace characterized his ORU buildings as "sculptures", noting that an inspiration for his artistic sensibility was "whittling since I was a kid".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Evatt, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?subjectid=32&amp;articleid=20100929_32_E1_CUTLIN175896 "ORU architect's home to be auctioned"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', September 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been suggested that the buildings may have been inspired by Tulsa's [[art deco]] architectural heritage&lt;ref&gt;For more detail regarding Tulsa's art deco heritage, see [[List of Art Deco buildings in Tulsa, Oklahoma]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moderntulsa.net/index.php/archive/oru-tulsa-oral-roberts-university-oral-roberts-architecture-modern-university-modern-architecture|title=''Modern Tulsa'' blog archive for ORU|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201164639/http://www.moderntulsa.net/index.php/archive/oru-tulsa-oral-roberts-university-oral-roberts-architecture-modern-university-modern-architecture|archivedate=1 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Bruce Goff]]'s individualistic style and creative use of new materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okmag.com/index.cfm?id=44&amp;homepageid=36 "A Century of Structures,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010060353/http://www.okmag.com/index.cfm?id=44&amp;homepageid=36 |date=2007-10-10 }} from ''Oklahoma Magazine'' (retrieved 18 July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007 the campus was described as "a perfect representation of the popular modernistic architecture of the time... the set of ''[[The Jetsons]]''" but also "shabby" and "dated, like [[Walt Disney|Disney's]] [[Tomorrowland]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Justin Juozapavicius, Associated Press, ''[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9XJtq8scoszIFZLWUjrR8mPuBFQD8S38PR80 Scandal Brewing at Oral Roberts U.]'', 5 October 2007 retrieved 7 October 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040106/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9XJtq8scoszIFZLWUjrR8mPuBFQD8S38PR80 |date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hts11eOY7H11NnIWiVKcH4wZJt2QD8SPM0OO0 |title=Oral Roberts' Son Accused of Misspending |agency=Associated Press |date=November 8, 2007 |first= |last= |accessdate=2007-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111161744/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hts11eOY7H11NnIWiVKcH4wZJt2QD8SPM0OO0 |archivedate=November 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle's Case Studies, ''[http://www.carlisle-syntec.com/index.cfm?act=case_study_detail&amp;Press_ID=523 Oral Roberts University Fights Back with Help from Carlisle SynTec] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012195328/http://carlisle-syntec.com/index.cfm?act=case_study_detail&amp;Press_ID=523 |date=2007-10-12 }}'' 19 March 2007, retrieved 07 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance of the many unique but aging buildings, structures and architectural details on campus was cited as a growing problem for the university.&lt;ref&gt;Lost Tulsa, ''[http://www.losttulsa.com/2006/02/oral-roberts-university-in-decay-as.html Oral Roberts University in Decay] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184010/http://losttulsa.com/2006/02/oral-roberts-university-in-decay-as.html# |date=2007-10-12 }}', 10 February 2006, retrieved 07 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, $10 million was set aside from [[Mart Green|Green]] family donations for long deferred maintenance on many campus buildings, along with the prayer tower.

[[Image:Howard Prayer Tower.jpg|thumb|Howard Auditorium and the Prayer Tower (the gas flame at the top of the tower is barely visible in this photograph)]]
The front entrance onto campus is a divided, landscaped roadway, originally called The Avenue of Flags and now renamed Billy Joe Daugherty circle, lined with lighted flags representing the more than 60 nations from which ORU students have been drawn.

The main academic building is the John D. Messick Learning Resource Center / Marajen Chinigo Graduate Center, an immense 900,000 square foot (80,000 m²) facility with many pylon-like columns, gold-tinted windows and a [[lozenge]] shaped [[Surface area|footprint]] that university publicity says was styled after [[Solomon's Temple|King Solomon's Temple]]. The Howard Auditorium is a gold, [[Buckminster Fuller]] style geodesic dome that is used for movies, theatre productions, classes and seminars. Bi-weekly university chapel services are held in Christ's Chapel, a 3,500 seat building constructed in drape-like fashion as an echo of Oral Roberts' early tent [[Revivalism|revivals]]. The [[Googie]] style [[Prayer Tower]] at the center of campus was intended to resemble "an abstract [[Christian cross|cross]] and [[Crown of Thorns]]" and also houses a [[visitor center]]. The [[Mabee Center]] is an 11,000 seat arena on the southwestern edge of campus and is used for basketball games, concerts, church services and satellite television productions. Timko-Barton Hall houses musical and theatrical performance halls as well as classrooms devoted to the university's programs in the performing arts. The building's performance halls are often the scene of concerts and recitals by performing arts students.

The [[Kenneth H. Cooper]] Aerobics Center houses basketball courts, an elevated running track, a free-weights and exercise room, a swimming pool and classrooms for students who are enrolled in [[Health Fitness|health fitness]] courses (a requirement for all students). J.L. Johnson Stadium is a 2,200 seat baseball stadium located on the north of the campus.

The [[Armand Hammer]] Alumni-Student Center was designed by KSQ Architects, PC, and constructed and completed in 2013. It is the first building to be built on the ORU campus in decades. It totes the largest TV in Oklahoma, a "living room" for students, a gaming center equipped with [[Wii]]'s and [[Xbox]]'s, pool tables, ping pong, and more. The building is a modern design fitting for the campus. Students also enjoy addition restaurants and a coffee shop. The Armand Hammer Student-Alumni Center also houses student government offices as well as board rooms for special meetings. No classes meet in this building; it is strictly for the use and enjoyment of the student body.

The Hamill Student Center is located between Ellis Melvin Roberts and Claudius Priscilla Roberts Halls and houses restaurants on its lower level. Zoppelt Auditorium is located on the ground level and is often used as a lecture hall for classes, forums and special events. Campus Security and the "Fireside Room" are also on ground level with the university cafeteria (called "Saga" by students) on the upper level.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"&gt;Student Handbook ''[http://www.oru.edu/catalog/ORU_hb0203.pdf Student Handbook Fall 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517165525/http://www.oru.edu/catalog/ORU_hb0203.pdf |date=2008-05-17 }}'' retrieved 3 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Housing ====
There are eight dormitories on campus.

* '''Claudius Priscilla Roberts Hall''' is a seven-story building built in 1965 that can house up to 600 women.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; Called "Claudius" by students, the building is named after Oral Roberts' mother.
* '''Ellis Melvin Roberts Hall''' is a seven-story building also built in 1967 that can house up to 600 men.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; Called "EMR" by campus residents, this dormitory is similar to Claudius Priscilla Roberts Hall but has some differences, notably walls made of concrete blocks rather than sheetrock, two elevators instead of one and laundry facilities located in the basement instead of every floor. According to the university, these two tri-winged buildings are meant to reflect the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;About ORU: [http://www.oru.edu/aboutoru/emr.php Ellis Melvin Roberts Hall &amp; Claudius and Priscilla Roberts Hall] retrieved 3 March 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203113618/http://www.oru.edu/aboutoru/emr.php |date=February 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Towers Dormitories.jpg|thumb|right|The four "Towers" residence halls, Michael Cardone, Wesley Leuhring, Susie Vinson and Frances Cardone.]]
* '''Frances Cardone Hall''' (originally named Ethel Hughes Hall) is a twelve-story building for housing up to 372 women.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; This is one of the four "Towers" dormitories, which are meant to represent the [[Star of David]].&lt;ref&gt;About ORU: [http://www.oru.edu/aboutoru/towers.php Towers] retrieved 3 March 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516084514/http://www.oru.edu/aboutoru/towers.php |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is called "Frances" by university students.
* '''Michael Cardone, Sr. Hall''' (originally named Edward Hughes Hall) is the twin dormitory to Frances and houses up to 372 men.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; It is linked to the three other Towers dormitories by a central hallway and the main lobby area, called the "Fishbowl" for its glass exterior walls.
* '''Susie Vinson Hall''' is one of two shorter "Towers" housing 244 women on eight stories and known as "Susie."&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt;
* '''Wesley Leuhring Hall''', called "Wesley" by students, is the twin dormitory of "Susie" and is much alike in both capacity and design.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; In the summer of 2017, Wesley was converted into a women's dorm and was to be called "Susie South."
* '''Gabrielle Christian Salem Hall''' is a three-story split-level dormitory located west of Timko-Barton Hall and called "Gabby" by the students. It can house up to 240 women and has secured doors that open using university issued cards. There are in-room bathroom facilities on the first and second floors.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt;

The university has strict guidelines concerning student access to the upper floors of residence halls by members of the opposite sex, which is limited to designated occasions called "Open Dorms."

==== CityPlex Towers ====
In 1981, the [[City of Faith Medical and Research Center]] opened. The buildings are south of the ORU campus, and were originally built as a 60-story clinic, a 30-story hospital, and a 20-story research center. The original tenants left in 1989 because of [[Finance|financial]] problems and a lack of demand for medical services. As of 2007, some floors (in the 20-story building) have never been leased. The facility is now mostly leased out as [[commerce|commercial]] [[office]] space under the name [[CityPlex Towers]]. A 60&amp;nbsp;ft (18.2 m), 30 [[ton]] bronze sculpture ''Praying Hands'', by sculptor Leonard McMurray (cast in [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Mexico]] in 1980) and originally in front of the towers, was moved to the ORU campus entrance in the summer of 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Tulsa World ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?no=subj&amp;articleid=240903&amp;archive=yes Moving hands]'' retrieved 09 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Athletics ==
{{Main|Oral Roberts Golden Eagles}}
Oral Roberts University is a member of [[The Summit League]] after leaving its former conference home, [[Southland Conference]], in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url =http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=440&amp;articleid=20111025_440_0_OralRo880305|title=Oral Roberts joins Southland Conference|author=Mike Brown|date=October 25, 2011 | accessdate=2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its athletic programs include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and tennis along with track and field for men and women. There is also a baseball program for men and volleyball for women.

ORU's early sports team nicknames were the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] for men and the Lady Titans for women, adopted in 1965 by a vote of the student body. On April 30, 1993, all teams for both men and women became known as the [[Oral Roberts Golden Eagles|Golden Eagle]]s. ORU's current [[mascot]] is "Eli" the [[golden eagle]], who hatched out of his [[papier-mâché]] egg on November 17, 1993 before the start of an exhibition basketball game as the official symbol of a new era in ORU athletics. The mascot's name is an [[acronym]] for education, lifeskills and integrity.

The men's basketball team coached by [[Scott Sutton]] went to three straight [[NCAA]] tournaments from 2006 to 2008.{{When|date=March 2012}} ORU's women's basketball team has appeared in four NCAA tournaments in the past eight seasons.

The ORU baseball team has played in 21 NCAA regional tournaments. ORU advanced to the College World Series in 1978. In 2006, ORU advanced to the NCAA Super Regional against Clemson.  ORU baseball once won 12 consecutive conference championships and played in 12 consecutive NCAA regional tournaments (1998 to 2009).&lt;ref name="thesummitleague.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesummitleague.org/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3900&amp;ATCLID=3742285 |title=ORU Captures Baseball Championship Title With 6-2 Win Over SDSU - theSummitLeague.org—Official Web Site of The Summit League |publisher=Thesummitleague.org |date=2009-05-24 |accessdate=2011-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723023808/http://www.thesummitleague.org/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3900&amp;ATCLID=3742285 |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

=== Doctrine ===
ORU has been criticized for endorsing [[orthodoxy|unorthodox]] doctrines of [[faith]]. Critics cite Oral Roberts' connection with [[Word of Faith]] doctrine and how they believe this has been used for self-promotion and justification of [[economic materialism]]. Oral Roberts helped pioneer the concept of "[[Seed Faith]]", which associated acts of God with the results of an individual's previous investment into God's will, like a plant growing from the investment of a seed. Scriptural citations for the doctrine include Luke 6:38  "Give, and it shall be given unto you, full measure pressed down shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom; for what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you again". Critics{{Who|date=September 2009}} claim this is equivalent to believing [[miracle]]s can be bought and makes God into a manipulable party. This so-called "Seed Faith" is thought of widely  as a scam to trick socially and intellectually weak believers into sending funds to preachers who adhere to this principle.

Some of the earliest criticisms of the Word of Faith movement came from ORU faculty members including Professor [[Charles Farah]] and one of his students, Daniel Ray McConnell. McConnell submitted a PhD thesis to the university detailing his assertion that the teachings of the movement are heretical. This was later published as ''A Different Gospel'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;D.R. McConnell, ''A Different Gospel'', updated edition, (Hendrickson, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramadan disruption===
In February 1997, on the 28th day of [[Ramadan]], several students from Oral Roberts University reportedly disrupted services at a mosque in the city of [[Tulsa]] near the [[University of Tulsa]]. The students mistakenly thought it was the 27th night of Ramadan, which is the holiest night of the Muslim calendar. Mujeeb Cheema, the chairman of the Islamic Society of Tulsa at that time, told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "Some 20 Oral Roberts students put their hands on the exterior doors and walls of the mosque and prayed for the conversion of the Muslims." The students left after police had been summoned to the scene.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/12/us/oral-roberts-students-anger-muslims.html|title=Oral Roberts Students Anger Muslims|date=12 February 1997|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days after the event, the society received a written apology from the Reverend Bill Shuler, who was the director of religious services on the ORU campus. A university spokesman indicated that the students would not be disciplined and that officials from the university were discussing with the students their accounts of the events, which differed from what was reported by the Muslims attending the religious services. Another Oral Roberts official, Jesse Pisors, further stated that despite the fact that students were praying for the conversion of Muslims, "their purpose specifically was not to proselytize or to intimidate."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

=== LGBT issues ===
Citing alleged discrimination against [[LGBT]] students at ORU, in 2006 [[Soulforce (organization)|Soulforce]] placed the university on its 2006 [[Equality Ride]] route and the rally took place on March 20, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/education/422259/activists_plan_to_visit_2_private_colleges/index.html "Activists Plan to Visit 2 Private Colleges"] redOrbit, September 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; University administration refused the activists the right to enter the campus and several were arrested after they entered the campus in spite of the university administration's decision.  Soulforce members object to the university's honor code pledge's ban on homosexual activity (i.e. homosexual intercourse). All students are required to sign and abide by the honor code which places the same restriction on all sexual activity performed outside of "traditional marriage of one man and one woman."&lt;ref name="Oral Roberts University 2009"/&gt;

While homosexual activity is against the school's honor code, many LGBTQ students have still attended the school due to family or personal choice. Over time, ORU alumni have made groups such as ORU-OUT and gay-straight alliances to allow LGBTQ students and alumni to have social support groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oruout.com/|title=oruout — All for One and Love for All|work=oruout|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102162423/http://www.oruout.com/|archivedate=2 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oru-out.tumblr.com/|title=ORU Out|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215221549/http://oru-out.tumblr.com/|archivedate=15 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alumni of the University have also dedicated Facebook groups and petitions to stand against harsh anti-gay laws in Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/ORU-Alumni-Against-Ugandas-Anti-Homosexuality-Bill/168570909834655?sk=info|title=ORU Alumni Against Uganda’s Anti-Homosexuality Bill - About - Facebook|work=Facebook|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oxford Internet Institute Front Door.jpg|thumb|Front door of the Oxford Internet Institute on St Giles, Oxford.]]
The '''Oxford Internet Institute''' ('''OII''') is a multi-disciplinary department of social and computer science dedicated to the study of information, communication, and technology, and is part of the [[Social Sciences Division, University of Oxford|Social Sciences Division]] of the [[University of Oxford]], England. It is housed over three sites on [[St Giles', Oxford|St Giles]] in [[Oxford]], including a primary site at 1 St Giles, owned by [[Balliol College]]. The department undertakes research and teaching devoted to understanding life online, with the aim of shaping [[Internet]] research, policy, and practice.

Founded in 2001, the OII has tracked the Internet's development and use, aiming to shed light on individual, collective and institutional behaviour online. The department brings together academics from a wide range of disciplines including political science, sociology, geography, economics, philosophy, physics and psychology.

Professor [[William H. Dutton]] served as Director of the OII from 2001 to 2011. Professor [[Helen Margetts]] occupied the Directorship between 2011 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/news/?id=580|title=Professor Helen Margetts Appointed Director of the Oxford Internet Institute|accessdate=7 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director is Professor [[Philip N. Howard]].

== Research ==
Research at the OII covers a huge variety of topics, with faculty publishing journal articles and books on issues including [[privacy]] and [[Computer security|security]], [[e-government]] and [[e-democracy]], [[Virtual economy|virtual economies]], [[Smart city|smart cities]], digital exclusion, [[digital humanities]], online gaming, [[big data]] and [[Internet Geography|Internet geography]]. The OII currently has the following research clusters reflecting the diverse expertise of faculty: 
* Digital Politics and Government 
* Information Governance and Security 
* Social Data Science 
* [http://cii.oii.ox.ac.uk Connectivity, Inclusion and Inequality] 
* Internet Economies 
* [http://dkc.oii.ox.ac.uk Digital Knowledge and Culture] 
* Education, Digital Life and Wellbeing 
* [http://epic.oii.ox.ac.uk Ethics and Philosophy of Information]

The faculty and students of the OII have made many advances to the study of technology and society. Director [[Helen Margetts]]' book Political Turbulence was the first book-length manuscript on the impact of social media on public life.  [[Viktor Mayer-Schönberger]]'s book Big Data was the first to define and explain the importance of big data in contemporary economics, culture, and politics.  Professor [[Philip N. Howard]] was the first political scientist to define and study [[astroturfing]] and has been responsible for significant research on fake news, bots and trolls in international affairs.  [[Luciano Floridi]] is the world's leading ethicist on AI and big data.

===Studies of Wikipedia===
OII has published several studies in Internet geography and Wikipedia. In November 2011, the Guardian Data Blog published maps of [[geotagged]] Wikipedia articles written in English, [[Arabic]], [[Egyptian Arabic]], [[French language|French]], [[Hebrew]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/nov/11/wikipedia-map-world-languages | work=The Guardian | first=Simon | last=Rogers | title=The world of Wikipedia's languages mapped | date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; OII Senior Research Fellow Mark Graham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/?id=165|title=Dr. Mark Graham|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; led the study and published the results on his blog, ''Zero Geography''.&lt;ref name="zerogeography"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mark Graham|title=Mapping Wikipedia's augmentations of our planet|url=http://www.zerogeography.net/2011/11/mapping-wikipedias-augmentations-of-our.html|accessdate=2014-09-04|date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham also leads an OII project focused on how new users are perceived, represented, and incorporated into the Wikipedia community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia's Networks and Geographies: Representation and Power in Peer-Produced Content|url=http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id=66|publisher=Oxford Internet Institute|accessdate=2014-09-04|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, OII researchers published a study of controversial topics in 10 different language versions of Wikipedia, using data related to "edit wars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1305.5566v2|last1=Yasseri|first1=Taha|title=The most controversial topics in Wikipedia: A multilingual and geographical analysis|last2=Spoerri|first2=Anselm|last3=Graham|first3=Mark|last4=Kertész|first4=János|class=physics.soc-ph|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of late, the OII has, amongst other things, been involved in research on the effects of computational propaganda, the [[Big data ethics|ethics of big data]] in different contexts and the political implications of the Internet and social media. It closely collaborates with other institutions of the University of Oxford such as the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, the department for computer science and the Oxford Martin School.

== Teaching ==
Since 2006, the OII has offered a [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] (doctoral) degree in "Information, Communication, and the Social Sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/teaching/dphil/|title=Oxford Internet Institute's D.

==History==
The Oxford Internet Institute was made possible by a major donation from the [[Shirley Foundation]] of over £10m, with public funding totalling over £5m from the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]].

The idea originated with Derek Wyatt MP, was quickly espoused by Colin Lucas, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, and Andrew Graham, then Master-Elect of Balliol.  Two Balliol Fellows, who knew Dame Stephanie from The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists, approached Dame Stephanie for support.

The Oxford Internet Institute is part of a small network of research centres that includes the centres like the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society]] and [[Information Society Project]] at Yale Law School.  But it is the only one that functions as a fully functioning, degree-granting department.

'''Paul Henry Landis''', (5 March 1901 &amp;ndash; 30 August 1985) was an American [[sociologist]]. A prolific writer of over 20 books and 100 journal articles, Landis’s work spanned the fields of [[rural sociology]], Natural Resource Sociology, [[Sociology of Education]], [[Adolescence]], Social Control, and many other topics.  Born in [[Cuba, Illinois]], Landis was raised in a fundamentalist religious upbringing, before attending [[Greenville College]] and eventually the [[University of Michigan]] for a [[Masters Degree]] and [[The University of Minnesota]] for a [[PhD]].&lt;ref name="American Sociological Association Newsletter “Footnotes” October 1985 (Volume 13, Number 8) "&gt;American Sociological Association Newsletter “Footnotes” October 1985 (Volume 13, Number 8)[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/1985/ASA.07.1985.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation from the University of Minnesota in 1931, Landis joined the faculty of [[South Dakota State University]] (then called South Dakota State College) as an [[assistant professor]] in the Department of Rural Sociology. His PhD dissertation on Minnesota's [[Iron Range]] was published as the book ''Three Iron Mining Towns: a study in cultural change'', now considered a landmark in Natural Resource Sociology. In 1935 he joined the faculty of the [[Washington State University]] (at the time called the State College of Washington), eventually becoming the official State Professor of Sociology, as well eventually Dean of the Graduate School at Washington State.  Landis was elected and served as President of the [[Rural Sociological Society]] from 1945-1946.&lt;ref name="List of Past Presidents "&gt;Rural Sociological Association List of Past Presidents [http://www2.ca.uky.edu/snarl/rss/PastPresidents.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''potentiostat''' is the [[electronic hardware]] required to control a [[Voltammetry|three electrode cell]] and run most [[Electroanalytical method|electroanalytical]] experiments.  A ''Bipotentiostat'' and ''polypotentiostat'' are potentiostats capable of controlling two working electrodes and more than two working electrodes, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, A.J.; Faulkner, L.R. '''Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications.''' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2nd Edition, '''2000''' {{ISBN|0-471-40521-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia G. Zoski (Editor) '''[[Handbook of Electrochemistry]]'''.  Elsevier, '''2007''' {{ISBN|0-444-51958-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Kissinger, William R. Heineman '''Laboratory Techniques in Electroanalytical Chemistry'''.  CRC Press, '''1996''' {{ISBN|0-8247-9445-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A. Skoog, F. James Holler, Timothy A. Nieman '''Principles of Instrumental Analysis'''. Harcourt Brace College Publishers, '''1998''' {{ISBN|0-03-002078-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The system functions by maintaining the [[voltage|potential]] of the [[working electrode]] at a constant level with respect to the [[reference electrode]] by adjusting the [[electric current|current]] at an [[auxiliary electrode]]. It consists of an [[electric circuit]] which is usually described in terms of simple [[op amps]].

== Primary use ==
This equipment is fundamental to modern [[electrochemical]] studies using [[Voltammetry|three electrode systems]] for investigations of [[electrochemical reaction mechanism|reaction mechanisms]] related to [[redox]] chemistry and other [[chemistry|chemical]] phenomena.  The dimensions of the resulting data depend on the experiment.  In [[voltammetry]], [[electric current]] in [[ampere|amps]] is plotted against [[electric potential]] in [[voltage]].   In a [[bulk electrolysis]] total [[coulomb]]s passed (total [[electric charge]]) is plotted against time in seconds even though the experiment measures electric current ([[ampere]]s) over time.  This is done to show that the experiment is approaching an expected number of coulombs.    

Most early potentiostats could function independently, providing data output through a physical data trace.  Modern potentiostats are designed to interface with a [[personal computer]] and operate through a dedicated [[software]] package.  The automated software allows the user rapidly to shift between experiments and experimental conditions.  The computer allows data to be stored and analyzed more effectively, rapidly, and accurately than historic methods.

== Basic relationships ==
A potentiostat is a [[Controller (control theory)|control]] and [[measuring]] device.  It comprises an [[electric circuit]] which controls the potential across the cell by sensing changes in its  [[electrical resistance|resistance]], varying accordingly the current supplied to the system: a higher resistance will result in a decreased current, while a lower resistance will result in an increased current, in order to keep the voltage constant as described by [[Ohm's law]].

:&lt;math&gt;{R} = {E \over I}&lt;/math&gt;
As a result, the variable system [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and the controlled current are [[inversely proportional]]
:&lt;math&gt;I_o={E_c \over R_v}&lt;/math&gt;
:*''&lt;math&gt;I_o&lt;/math&gt;'' is the output electric current of the potentiostat
:*''&lt;math&gt;E_c&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[voltage]] that is kept constant
:*''&lt;math&gt;R_v&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[electrical resistance]] that varies.

== Principles of operation ==
Since 1942, when Hickling built the first three electrode potentiostat,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| volume = 38
| pages = 27–33
| last = Hickling
| first = A.
| title = Studies in electrode polarisation. Part IV.-The automatic control of the potential of a working electrode

| doi = 10.1039/TF9423800027
}}&lt;/ref&gt; substantial progress has been made to improve the instrument.  Hickling's device used a third electrode, the [[reference electrode]] to control the cell potential automatically. Up until the present day his principle has remained in use. At a glance, a potentiostat measures the potential difference between the working and the reference electrode, applies the current through the counter electrode and measures the current as an &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;  voltage drop over a series resistor (&lt;math&gt; R_{\textrm m} &lt;/math&gt; in Fig. 1).

The control amplifier (CA) is responsible for maintaining the voltage between the reference and the working electrode as closely as possible to the voltage of the input source &lt;math&gt; E_{\textrm i} &lt;/math&gt;. It adjusts its output to automatically control the cell current so that a condition of equilibrium is satisfied. The theory of operation is best understood using the equations below.

Prior to observing the following equations, one may note that, from an electrical point of view, the electrochemical cell and the current measurement resistor &lt;math&gt; R_{\textrm m} &lt;/math&gt; may be regarded as two impedances (Fig. 2).  &lt;math&gt; Z_1 &lt;/math&gt; includes &lt;math&gt; R_{\textrm m}&lt;/math&gt; in series with the interfacial impedance of the [[counter electrode]] and the solution resistance between the counter and the reference. &lt;math&gt; Z_2 &lt;/math&gt;
represents the interfacial impedance of the working electrode in series with the solution resistance between the working and the reference
electrodes. 
[[File:Potentiostat4.png|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 2 : Schematic of a potentiostat, with electrochemical cell replaced by two impedances.]]

The role of the control amplifier is to amplify the potential difference between the positive (or noninverting) input and the negative (or inverting) input. This may be translated mathematically into the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt; E_{\textrm{out}}=A\,(E^+-E^-)=A\,(E_{\textrm i}-E_{\textrm r}) &lt;/math&gt;. (1)

where &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is the amplification factor of the CA. At this point the assumption may be made that a negligible amount of current is flowing through the reference electrode. This correlates to physical phenomenon since the reference electrode is connected to a high impedance electrometer.  Thus, the cell current may be described in two ways:

:&lt;math&gt; I_{\textrm c}=\frac{E_{\textrm{out}}}{Z_1+Z_2} &lt;/math&gt;(2)

and

:&lt;math&gt; I_{\textrm c}=\frac{E_{\textrm r}}{Z_2} &lt;/math&gt;. (3)

Combining Eqs.  (2) and (3) yields Eq. (4):

:&lt;math&gt; E_{\textrm r}=\frac{Z_2}{Z_1+Z_2}\,E_{\textrm{out}}=\beta\,E_{\textrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt; (4)

where &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of the output voltage of the control amplifier returned to its negative input; namely the feedback factor:

:&lt;math&gt; \beta=\frac{Z_2}{Z_1+Z_2} &lt;/math&gt;.

Combining Eqs. (1) and (4) yields Eq. (6):

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{E_{\textrm r}}{E_{\textrm i}}=\frac{\beta\,A}{1+\beta\,A} &lt;/math&gt;. (6)

When the quantity &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;  becomes very large with respect to one, Eq.  (6) reduces to Eq. (7), which is one of the negative feedback equations:

:&lt;math&gt; E_{\textrm i}=E_{\textrm r} &lt;/math&gt;. (7)

Eq. (7) proves that the control amplifier works to keep the voltage between the reference and the working close to the input source voltage.

== Software control ==
Replacing the CA, a control algorithm can maintain a constant voltage &lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm c}&lt;/math&gt; between the reference electrode and the working electrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siegert | first1 = M. | year = 2018 | title = A scalable multi-channel software potentiostat | url = https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2018.00131/full | journal = [[Frontiers in Energy Research]] | volume = 6 | page = 131 | doi = 10.3389/fenrg.2018.00131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This algorithm is based on the [[rule of proportion]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{U_{\textrm m}}{E_{\textrm c}} = \frac{U_{\textrm n}}{E_{\textrm {SP}}} &lt;/math&gt;. (8)

:*''&lt;math&gt;U_{\textrm m}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the last measured cell voltage between the working electrode (WE) and the counter electrode (CE).
:*''&lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm c}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the last measured electrochemical potential, i.e. the voltage between the reference electrode and WE to be kept constant.
:*''&lt;math&gt;U_{\textrm n}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the next cell voltage to be set, i.e. the controller output.
:*''&lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm {SP}}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]], i.e. the desired &lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm c}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the measurement intervals of Eq. (8) are kept constant, the control algorithm sets the cell voltage &lt;math&gt;U_{\textrm m}&lt;/math&gt; so to keep &lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm c}&lt;/math&gt; as close as possible to the setpoint &lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm {SP}}&lt;/math&gt;. The algorithm requires software-controllable hardware such as a [[digital multimeter]], a [[power supply]], and a double-pull double-though [[relay]]. The relay is necessary to switch polarity.

== Significant features ==
In electrochemical experiments the electrodes are the pieces of equipment that comes in immediate contact with the [[analyte]].   For this reason the electrodes are very important for determining the experimental result.  The electrode surface may or may not catalyze chemical reactions.  The size of the electrodes affects the magnitude of the currents passed which can affect signal to noise.  But electrodes are not the only limiting factor for electrochemical experiments, the potentiostat also has a limited range of operation.  The following are a few significant features that vary between instruments.
 
*''Electric potential range (measured and applied)'': while the potential window is mostly based on the solvent window the electronics can also limit the possible range.
*''Accuracy in potential (measured and applied)'': limits of deviations between the actual and reported.
*''Range of scan rate'': how slow or fast a  potential window can be scanned this is most important for experiments that require high scan rates such as those involving [[ultramicroelectrode]]s.
*''Sample rate'': the rate at which potential or voltage can be accurately sampled.  This can be important for experiments that need high scan rates such as those involving ultramicroelectrodes.
*''File size'':  a limiting factor can be the file size limit.  This would most likely affect the choice of the potential range swept or the potential sample rate.
*''Electric current range (measured and applied)'': the maximum range over which current can be sampled.  Applying large currents is important for experiments that pass a great deal of current like a large [[bulk electrolysis]].  Measuring small currents is important for experiments that pass small currents like those involving ultramicroelectrodes.
*''Current resolution'': determines the operational range of a specific experiment and the bit resolution of that data in the current dimension.
*''Accuracy in current (measured and applied)'': limits of deviations between the actual and reported.
*''Number of working channels'': how many [[working electrode]]s can the instrument control.  A ''bipotentiostat'' is necessary to controlling systems with two working electrodes like a [[rotating ring-disk electrode]].  A ''polypotentiostat'' may be important for controlling some biological experiments with three or more working electrodes.
*''Footprint'': potentiostats include small devices of about 20 x 10 x 5&amp;nbsp;cm weighing well under a kilogram or a simple board that can be installed in a desktop computer.  A large bench-top model would be on the order of 50 x 20 x 10&amp;nbsp;cm and weigh up to or more than 5 kilograms.
*''Interface'': can the instrument run independently or must they be slaved to a personal computer.
*''Sweep generator'': can the system apply an analogue sweep or does it use a digital staircase generator as an approximation.  If it does use a digital staircase then the resolution of the staircase is important.
*''Rotating electrode'': can the instrument operate a rotating electrode.  This is intrinsic for experiments that require a [[rotating disk electrode]] or [[rotating ring-disk electrode]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4174">In philosophy and rhetoric, the '''principle of charity''' or '''charitable interpretation''' requires interpreting a speaker's statements in the most rational way possible and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Normand Baillargeon: ''Intellectual Self-Defense''. Seven Stories Press 2007, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In its narrowest sense, the goal of this methodological principle is to avoid attributing irrationality, [[logical fallacies]], or falsehoods to the others' statements, when a coherent, rational interpretation of the statements is available. According to [[Simon Blackburn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Blackburn |first=Simon
|year=1994
|title=''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]''
|location=Oxford
|publisher=Oxford University Press
|page=62
}}&lt;/ref&gt; "it constrains the interpreter to maximize the truth or rationality in the subject's sayings."

==Application==
Neil L. Wilson gave the principle its name in 1958–59. Its main area of application, by his lights, is determining the referent of a proper name:
&lt;blockquote&gt;How should we set about discovering the significance which a person attaches to a given name? […] Let us suppose that somebody (whom I am calling "Charles") makes just the following five assertions containing the name "Caesar." […]&lt;br/&gt;
(1) Caesar conquered Gaul. (Gc) &lt;br/&gt;
(2) Caesar crossed the Rubicon. (Rc) &lt;br/&gt;
(3) Caesar was murdered on the Ides of March. (Mc) &lt;br/&gt;
(4) Caesar was addicted to the use of the ablative absolute. (Ac)&lt;br/&gt;
(5) Caesar was married to Boadicea. (Bc)&lt;br/&gt;
[…] And so we act on what might be called the Principle of Charity. We select as designatum that individual which will make the largest possible number of Charles' statements true. […] We might say the designatum is that individual which satisfies more of the asserted matrices containing the word "Caesar" than does any other individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide other formulations of the principle of charity. Davidson sometimes referred to it as ''the principle of rational accommodation''. He summarized it: ''We make maximum sense of the words and thoughts of others when we interpret in a way that optimises agreement''. The principle may be invoked to make sense of a speaker's utterances when one is unsure of their meaning. In particular, Quine's use of the principle gives it this latter, wide domain.

Since the time of Quine ''et al.'', other philosophers{{Who|date=August 2011}} have formulated at least four versions of the principle of charity. These alternatives may conflict with one another, so which principle to use may depend on the goal of the conversation. The four principles are:

#The other uses words in the ordinary way;
#The other makes true statements;
#The other makes valid arguments;
#The other says something interesting.

A related principle is the [[principle of humanity]], which states that we must assume that another speaker's beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her "the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances" ([[Daniel Dennett]], "Mid-Term Examination," in ''The Intentional Stance'', p.&amp;nbsp;343).

'''RAF Fylingdales''' is a [[Royal Air Force]] station on Snod Hill in the [[North York Moors]], England. Its motto is "Vigilamus" (translates to "We are watching").&lt;ref name=":WG:"&gt;{{cite news|title=The changing faces of RAF Fylingdales|url=https://www.whitbygazette.co.uk/news/the-changing-faces-of-raf-fylingdales-1-6000187|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=The Whitby Gazette|date=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[radar]] [[Military base|base]] and is also part of the [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System]] (BMEWS). As part of intelligence-sharing arrangements between the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] (see, for example, the [[UKUSA Agreement]]), data collected at RAF Fylingdales are shared between the two countries. Its primary purpose is to give the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British]] and [[Federal government of the United States|US governments]] warning of an impending [[ballistic missile]] attack (part of the so-called [[four minute warning]] during the [[Cold War]]). A secondary role is the detection and tracking of orbiting objects; Fylingdales is part of the [[United States Space Surveillance Network]].&lt;ref name="yorkshirecnd.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yorkshirecnd.org.uk/campaigns/fylingdales/|title=Fylingdales - Yorkshire Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|website=yorkshirecnd.org.uk|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmdfence/290-i/290ap13.htm|title=House of Commons - Defence - Appendices to the Minutes of Evidence|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/fylingdales.htm|title=RAF Fylingdales|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as its early-warning and space-tracking roles, Fylingdales has a third function - the Satellite Warning Service for the UK.

In the late 1990s, the United States decided to pursue a [[National Missile Defense]] plan fully, and RAF Fylingdales attracted further publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK ready to help 'Son of Star Wars'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2658861.stm|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve tracking capabilities (for launches from [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]) the United States wanted the use of Fylingdales as part of its NMD network.  After receiving a formal request from the US, the British Government agreed to its use as an NMD tracking facility, in 2003. The decision was criticised, because the proposed NMD system was solely for US benefit.

A £449&amp;nbsp;million upgrade for RAF Fylingdales to become an NMD tracking facility is now underway by [[Boeing]], with [[Raytheon]] as the major subcontractor. It will replace many internal systems - computers, displays, etc - to improve resolution and tracking accuracy. No external changes are being made in direct relation to these upgrades and no power increases will occur.

According to the [[BBC]], ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that the British Government secretly agreed to a US request to station NMD missile interceptors at Fylingdales Moor in late 2004. This has subsequently been denied by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3750294.stm |title=MoD denies US missiles set for UK|work= [[BBC News Online]]|date= 17 October 2004|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health fears===
In June 2003, concern arose locally that RAF Fylingdales was emitting harmful emissions, after a possible [[cancer cluster]] was discovered around [[Cape Cod Air Force Station|a similar radar facility]] on [[Cape Cod]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radiation fears about radar base|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/2954306.stm|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=2 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The issue was investigated by the local [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] organisation, the Scarborough, Whitby and Ryedale [[Primary Care Trust]], and a report was released in December.  It concluded that there was no link between RAF Fylingdales and local cancer rates, nor any abnormal risk, as cancer rates in the immediate area proved to be normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/3244206.stm |title=No cancer link to base|work=BBC News|date=30 November 2003|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 MoD report on the impact of the NMD upgrade at RAF Fylingdales reiterated that the base was within health guidelines and would remain so.

==Operation==

===BMEWS===
While the radar station remains a British asset operated and commanded by the Royal Air Force, it also forms one of three stations in the United States BMEWS network (the United States also funds the cost of the radar units). The other two stations in the network are [[Thule Air Base]], [[Greenland]] and [[Clear Air Force Station]], [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name=":PS:"&gt;{{PastScape |num=1309868 |desc=RAF Fylingdales |access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data obtained by Fylingdales is shared fully and freely with the United States, where it feeds into the US-[[Canada|Canadian]] [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] at [[Peterson Air Force Base]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. To this end a [[United States Air Force]] liaison officer is stationed at the base.

The British Government advised in March 2018, that as of the beginning of that month, fewer than five [[United States Armed Forces|United States (US) military]] personnel and ten US contractors worked at the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2018-03-01/130642|title=USA: RAF Fylingdales:Written question - 130642|last=Lancaster|first=Mark|date=6 March 2018|website=UK Parliament|language=English|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems===
The primary radars of RAF Fylingdales are [[active electronically scanned array]] (AESA) phased array radars, mounted on each face of a truncated [[tetrahedron]], typically referred to as the "pyramid" or the SSPAR (Solid State Phased Array).&lt;ref name=":YP:" /&gt; This makes Fylingdales unique amongst its peers in that it covers a full 360 degrees. Each of the three arrays is {{convert|84|ft|adj=on}} across&lt;ref name=":PS:" /&gt; and contains around 2560 transmit/receive modules; mean power output is about {{nowrap|2.5 MW}}, with a tracking range of {{convert|3,000|nmi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/raffylingdales/aboutus/equipment.cfm |publisher=Ministry of Defence |title= RAF Fylingdales - Equipment|date= 4 May 2012|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
The functions of RAF Fylingdales have been subject to criticism from opposition groups, such as the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND), leading to [[protest]]s being held on occasion. These stem from concerns regarding the base's association with [[nuclear warfare]] and the [[militarisation of space]]. They argue against the UK assisting the US [[National Missile Defense]] (NMD) programme with RAF Fylingdales' ability to detect attacks, saying it is destabilising US and European relations with [[Russia]], makes the UK  the front line in any future conflict&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cnduk.org/cnd-calls-no-us-missile-defence-demo-fylingdales-radar-saturday/|title=CND calls 'No to US Missile Defence' demo at Fylingdales radar this Saturday - Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|date=9 June 2009|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it could be information from Fylingdales that initiates a nuclear response from the US and/or the UK to a perceived threat – real or false; intended or accidental.&lt;ref name="yorkshirecnd.org.uk"/&gt; The radar beam has created serious concern of radiation risks due to leakage from the sides of the beams -“side lobes”. Although the radiation levels are within UK limits ([[NRPB]]), it would be harder for the base to keep within the tighter EU limits (INIRPB), which the UK may soon adopt.&lt;ref name="yorkshirecnd.org.uk"/&gt; 

The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) defends the use and role of the facility, regarding RAF Fylingdales as part of the UK's contribution to counter a military threat. The MoD states that, although ballistic missile attack is a minor threat currently, this could change in the long-term future, if as-yet unknown enemies develop missiles as a means to overcome large distances to strike at the UK.

Another RAF Station, [[Menwith Hill|RAF Menwith Hill]], is also located in Yorkshire and has a close arrangement with the United States. It, too, has been the focus of protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US spy base protest ends|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1421374.stm|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=4 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural reference===
The monitoring function is referred to in the [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] song "Fylingdale Flyer" which appears on the album ''[[A (Jethro Tull album)|A]]'' and in the ''[[Slipstream (video)|Slipstream]]'' video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cornick|first1=Scott Allen Nollen ; foreword by Ian Anderson ; afterword by David Pegg ; with the participation of Glenn|last2=Perry|first2=Doane|title=Jethro Tull : a history of the band, 1968-2001|date=2002|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=0-7864-1101-5|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Moore|editor1-first=Allan F.|title=Analyzing popular music|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

'''Radiation therapy''' or '''radiotherapy''', often abbreviated '''RT''', '''RTx''', or '''XRT''', is [[therapy]] using [[ionizing radiation]], generally as part of [[oncology|cancer treatment]] to control or kill [[Malignancy|malignant]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] and normally delivered by a [[Linear particle accelerator|linear accelerator]]. Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of [[adjuvant therapy]], to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with [[chemotherapy]], and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called '''radiation oncology'''.

Radiation therapy is commonly applied to the cancerous tumor because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the [[DNA]] of cancerous tissue leading to [[mitotic catastrophe|cellular death]].  To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger [[absorbed dose]] there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. Besides the tumour itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement (for example, respiration and bladder filling) and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position.

Radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation, and is distinct from [[radiology]], the use of radiation in [[medical imaging]] and [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. Radiation may be prescribed by a [[radiation oncologist]] with intent to cure ("curative") or for adjuvant therapy. It may also be used as [[Palliative care|palliative treatment]] (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and it can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with [[surgery]], chemotherapy, [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormone therapy]], [[immunotherapy]] or some mixture of the four. Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way.

The precise treatment intent (curative&lt;!--let's not use the term radical till we define it (below)--&gt;, adjuvant, [[Neoadjuvant therapy|neoadjuvant therapeutic]], or palliative) will depend on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. [[Total body irradiation]] (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a [[bone marrow transplant]]. [[Brachytherapy]], in which a [[radioactive source]] is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of [[trigeminal neuralgia]], [[Vestibular schwannoma|acoustic neuromas]], severe [[Graves' ophthalmopathy|thyroid eye disease]], [[pterygium]], [[pigmented villonodular synovitis]], and prevention of [[keloid]] scar growth, vascular [[restenosis]], and [[heterotopic ossification]]. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.

==Medical uses==
[[File:Palliative Care Options for a Young Adult Patient with a Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma - Fig. 3.png|thumb|Radiation therapy for a patient with a [[diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma]], with radiation dose color-coded.]]
Different cancers respond to radiation therapy in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;CK Bomford, IH Kunkler, J Walter. Walter and Miller’s Textbook of Radiation therapy (6th Ed), p311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Radiosensitivity" on GP notebook http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=2060451853&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Radiation therapy- what GPs need to know" on patient.co.uk http://patient.info/doctor/radiotherapy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Note: these refs support the whole list here --&gt;

The response of a cancer to radiation is described by its radiosensitivity.
Highly radiosensitive cancer cells are rapidly killed by modest doses of radiation. These include [[leukemias]], most [[lymphomas]] and [[germ cell tumors]].
The majority of [[epithelial cancers]] are only moderately radiosensitive, and require a significantly higher dose of radiation (60-70&amp;nbsp;Gy) to achieve a radical cure.
Some types of cancer are notably radioresistant, that is, much higher doses are required to produce a radical cure than may be safe in clinical practice. [[Renal cell cancer]] and [[melanoma]] are generally considered to be radioresistant but radiation therapy is still a palliative option for many patients with metastatic melanoma. Combining radiation therapy with [[immunotherapy]] is an active area of investigation and has shown some promise for melanoma and other cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maverakis E, Cornelius LA, Bowen GM, Phan T, Patel FB, Fitzmaurice S, He Y, Burrall B, Duong C, Kloxin AM, Sultani H, Wilken R, Martinez SR, Patel F | title = Metastatic melanoma - a review of current and future treatment options | journal = Acta Derm Venereol | volume = 95 | issue = 5 | pages = 516–524 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25520039 | doi = 10.2340/00015555-2035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to distinguish the radiosensitivity of a particular tumor, which to some extent is a laboratory measure, from the radiation "curability" of a cancer in actual clinical practice. For example, leukemias are not generally curable with radiation therapy, because they are disseminated through the body. Lymphoma may be radically curable if it is localised to one area of the body. Similarly, many of the common, moderately radioresponsive tumors are routinely treated with curative doses of radiation therapy if they are at an early stage. For example: [[Skin neoplasm|non-melanoma skin cancer]], [[head and neck cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[non-small cell lung cancer]], [[cervical cancer]], [[anal cancer]], and [[prostate cancer]]. [[Metastatic]] cancers are generally incurable with radiation therapy because it is not possible to treat the whole body.

Before treatment, a CT scan is often performed to identify the tumor and surrounding normal structures. The patient receives small skin marks to guide the placement of treatment fields.&lt;ref name=camphausen&gt;Camphausen KA, Lawrence RC. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter02/article/10165/1399960 "Principles of Radiation Therapy"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Patient positioning is crucial at this stage as the patient will have to be set-up in the identical position during treatment.  Many patient positioning devices have been developed for this purpose, including masks and cushions which can be molded to the patient.

The response of a tumor to radiation therapy is also related to its size. Due to complex [[radiobiology]], very large tumors respond less well to radiation than smaller tumors or microscopic disease. Various strategies are used to overcome this effect. The most common technique is surgical resection prior to radiation therapy. This is most commonly seen in the treatment of breast cancer with [[wide local excision]] or [[mastectomy]] followed by [[adjuvant radiation therapy]]. Another method is to shrink the tumor with [[neoadjuvant]] chemotherapy prior to radical radiation therapy. A third technique is to enhance the radiosensitivity of the cancer by giving certain drugs during a course of radiation therapy. Examples of radiosensitizing drugs include: [[Cisplatin]], [[Nimorazole]], and [[Cetuximab]].

The effect of radiotherapy on control of cancer has been shown to be limited to the first five years after surgery, particularly for breast cancer. The difference between breast cancer recurrence in patients who receive radiotherapy vs. those who don't is seen mostly in the first 2–3 years and no difference is seen after 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickberg A, Holmberg L, Adami HO, Magnuson A, Villman K, Liljegren G | title = Sector resection with or without postoperative radiotherapy for stage I breast cancer: 20-year results of a randomized trial | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 791–7 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24493730 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2013.50.6600 | lay-summary = http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~rmhkjsv/TARGIT-A-follow-up.pdf | lay-source = Jayant S Vaidya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==
Radiation therapy is in itself painless. Many low-dose [[Palliative care|palliative treatments]] (for example, radiation therapy to bony [[metastases]]) cause minimal or no side effects, although short-term pain flare-up can be experienced in the days following treatment due to oedema compressing nerves in the treated area. Higher doses can cause varying side effects during treatment (acute side effects), in the months or years following treatment (long-term side effects), or after re-treatment (cumulative side effects). The nature, severity, and longevity of side effects depends on the organs that receive the radiation, the treatment itself (type of radiation, dose, fractionation, concurrent chemotherapy), and the patient.

Most side effects are predictable and expected. Side effects from radiation are usually limited to the area of the patient's body that is under treatment. Side effects are dose- dependent; for example higher doses of head and neck radiation can be associated with [[cardiovascular]] complications, [[thyroid]] dysfunction, and [[pituitary]] axis dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mahmood SS |title=Cardiovascular Complications of Cranial and Neck Radiation |journal=Current Treatment Options in Cardiovascular Medicine|volume=18 |issue=45 | year= 2016|pmid=27181400 |doi=10.1007/s11936-016-0468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern radiation therapy aims to reduce side effects to a minimum and to help the patient understand and deal with side effects that are unavoidable.

The main side effects reported are fatigue and skin irritation, like a mild to moderate sun burn. The fatigue often sets in during the middle of a course of treatment and can last for weeks after treatment ends. The irritated skin will heal, but  may not be as elastic as it was before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/cancertypes/breast/possiblesideeffects.aspx |title=Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer: Possible Side Effects |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301041308/http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/cancertypes/breast/possiblesideeffects.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acute side effects===
; Nausea and vomiting
:This is not a general side effect of radiation therapy, and mechanistically is associated only with treatment of the stomach or abdomen (which commonly react a few hours after treatment), or with radiation therapy to certain nausea-producing structures in the head during treatment of certain head and neck tumors, most commonly the [[vestibule of the ear|vestibules of the inner ears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee VH, Ng SC, Leung TW, Au GK, Kwong DL | title = Dosimetric predictors of radiation-induced acute nausea and vomiting in IMRT for nasopharyngeal cancer | journal = International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–82 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22245210 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.10.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with any distressing treatment, some patients vomit immediately during radiotherapy, or even in anticipation of it, but this is considered a psychological response. Nausea for any reason can be treated with antiemetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.caring4cancer.com/go/cancer/effects/side-effects-of-radiation-therapy.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330060027/http://www.caring4cancer.com/go/cancer/effects/side-effects-of-radiation-therapy.htm |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }} Common radiation side effects&lt;/ref&gt;
; Damage to the [[epithelium|epithelial]] surfaces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/coping/radiation-therapy-and-you/page8 |title=Radiation Therapy Side Effects and Ways to Manage them|publisher=National Cancer Institute |date=2007-04-20 |accessdate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Epithelial surfaces may sustain damage from radiation therapy. Depending on the area being treated, this may include the skin, oral mucosa, pharyngeal, bowel mucosa and ureter. The rates of onset of damage and recovery from it depend upon the turnover rate of epithelial cells. Typically the skin starts to become pink and sore several weeks into treatment. The reaction may become more severe during the treatment and for up to about one week following the end of radiation therapy, and the skin may break down. Although this [[moist desquamation]] is uncomfortable, recovery is usually quick. Skin reactions tend to be worse in areas where there are natural folds in the skin, such as underneath the female breast, behind the ear, and in the groin.
; Mouth, throat and stomach sores
:If the head and neck area is treated, temporary soreness and ulceration commonly occur in the mouth and throat.&lt;ref name="radiobiology_for_the_radiologist_5"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hall | first1 = Eric J. | title = Radiobiology for the radiologist | year = 2000 | publisher = Lippincott Williams Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 9780781726498 | page =351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If severe, this can affect swallowing, and the patient may need painkillers and nutritional support/food supplements. The esophagus can also become sore if it is treated directly, or if, as commonly occurs, it receives a dose of collateral radiation during treatment of lung cancer.  When treating liver malignancies and metastases, it is possible for collateral radiation to cause gastric, stomach or duodenal ulcers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carretero C, Munoz-Navas M, Betes M, Angos R, Subtil JC, Fernandez-Urien I, De la Riva S, Sola J, Bilbao JI, de Luis E, Sangro B | title = Gastroduodenal injury after radioembolization of hepatic tumors | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 102 | issue = 6 | pages = 1216–20 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17355414 | doi = 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2007.01172.x  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yip D, Allen R, Ashton C, Jain S | title = Radiation-induced ulceration of the stomach secondary to hepatic embolization with radioactive yttrium microspheres in the treatment of metastatic colon cancer | journal = Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 347–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14748889 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2003.03322.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This collateral radiation is commonly caused by non-targeted delivery (reflux) of the radioactive agents being infused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murthy R, Brown DB, Salem R, Meranze SG, Coldwell DM, Krishnan S, Nunez R, Habbu A, Liu D, Ross W, Cohen AM, Censullo M | title = Gastrointestinal complications associated with hepatic arterial Yttrium-90 microsphere therapy | journal = Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 553–61; quiz 562 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17446547 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvir.2007.02.002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Methods, techniques and devices are available to lower the occurrence of this type of adverse side effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arepally A, Chomas J, Kraitchman D, Hong K | title = Quantification and reduction of reflux during embolotherapy using an antireflux catheter and tantalum microspheres: Ex vivo analysis | journal = Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 575–80 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23462064 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvir.2012.12.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Intestinal discomfort
:The lower bowel may be treated directly with radiation (treatment of rectal or anal cancer) or be exposed by radiation therapy to other pelvic structures (prostate, bladder, female genital tract). Typical symptoms are soreness, diarrhoea, and nausea.
; Swelling
:As part of the general [[inflammation]] that occurs, swelling of soft tissues may cause problems during radiation therapy. This is a concern during treatment of brain tumors and brain metastases, especially where there is pre-existing raised [[intracranial pressure]] or where the tumor is causing near-total obstruction of a [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] (e.g., [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] or main [[bronchus]]). Surgical intervention may be considered prior to treatment with radiation. If surgery is deemed unnecessary or inappropriate, the patient may receive [[steroids]] during radiation therapy to reduce swelling.
; Infertility
:The [[gonads]] (ovaries and testicles) are very sensitive to radiation. They may be unable to produce [[gametes]] following '''direct''' exposure to most normal treatment doses of radiation. Treatment planning for all body sites is designed to minimize, if not completely exclude dose to the gonads if they are not the primary area of treatment.

===Late side effects===
Late side effects occur months to years after treatment and are generally limited to the area that has been treated. They are often due to damage of blood vessels and connective tissue cells. Many late effects are reduced by fractionating treatment into smaller parts.

; [[Fibrosis]]
: Tissues which have been irradiated tend to become less elastic over time due to a diffuse scarring process.
; Epilation
: Epilation (hair loss) may occur on any hair bearing skin with doses above 1&amp;nbsp;Gy. It only occurs within the radiation field/s. Hair loss may be permanent with a single dose of 10&amp;nbsp;Gy, but if the dose is fractionated permanent hair loss may not occur until dose exceeds 45&amp;nbsp;Gy.
; Dryness
: The salivary glands and tear glands have a radiation tolerance of about 30&amp;nbsp;[[Gray (unit)|Gy]] in 2&amp;nbsp;Gy fractions, a dose which is exceeded by most radical head and neck cancer treatments. Dry mouth ([[xerostomia]]) and dry eyes ([[xerophthalmia]]) can become irritating long-term problems and severely reduce the patient's [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]]. Similarly, [[sweat gland]]s in treated skin (such as the [[armpit]]) tend to stop working, and the naturally moist vaginal [[mucosa]] is often dry following pelvic irradiation.
; [[Lymphedema]]
: Lymphedema, a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling, can result from damage to the lymphatic system sustained during radiation therapy. It is the most commonly reported complication in breast radiation therapy patients who receive adjuvant axillary radiotherapy following surgery to clear the axillary lymph nodes .&lt;ref name="pmid9874399"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meek AG | title = Breast radiation therapy and lymphedema | journal = Cancer | volume = 83 | issue = 12 Suppl American | pages = 2788–97 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9874399 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19981215)83:12B+&lt;2788::AID-CNCR27&gt;3.0.CO;2-I }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Cancer
: Radiation is a potential cause of cancer, and secondary malignancies are seen in a very small minority of patients – usually less than 1/1000. It usually occurs 20 – 30 years following treatment, although some haematological malignancies may develop within 5 – 10 years. In the vast majority of cases, this risk is greatly outweighed by the reduction in risk conferred by treating the primary cancer. The cancer occurs within the treated area of the patient.
; [[Cardiovascular disease]]
: Radiation can increase the risk of heart disease and death as observed in previous breast cancer RT regimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor CW, Nisbet A, McGale P, Darby SC | title = Cardiac exposures in breast cancer radiotherapy: 1950s-1990s | journal = International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 1484–95 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18035211 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.05.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therapeutic radiation increases the risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event (i.e., heart attack or stroke) by 1.5 to 4 times a person's normal rate, aggravating factors included.&lt;ref name="pmid:20298931"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weintraub NL, Jones WK, Manka D | title = Understanding radiation-induced vascular disease | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 55 | issue = 12 | pages = 1237–9 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20298931 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2009.11.053 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase is dose dependent, related to the RT's dose strength, volume and location.

; Cognitive decline
: In cases of radiation applied to the head radiation therapy may cause [[Radiation induced cognitive decline|cognitive decline]]. Cognitive decline was especially apparent in young children, between the ages of 5 to 11. Studies found, for example, that the IQ of 5 year old children declined each year after treatment by several IQ points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/lateeffects/HealthProfessional/page4|title=Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer|publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]|date=12 April 2012|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cumulative side effects===
Cumulative effects from this process should not be confused with long-term effects—when short-term effects have disappeared and long-term effects are subclinical, reirradiation can still be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nieder C, Milas L, Ang KK | title = Tissue tolerance to reirradiation | journal = Semin Radiat Oncol | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 200–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11034631 | doi = 10.1053/srao.2000.6593 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These doses are calculated by the radiation oncologist and many factors are taken into account before the subsequent radiation takes place.

===Effects on reproduction===
During the first two weeks after [[fertilization]], radiation therapy is lethal but not [[teratogenic]].&lt;ref name="arnon2011"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Arnon J, Meirow D, Lewis-Roness H, Ornoy A|year=2001|title=Genetic and teratogenic effects of cancer treatments on gametes and embryos|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=7|issue=4|pages=394–403|doi=10.1093/humupd/7.4.394|pmid=11476352}} [http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/394.full.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; High doses of radiation during pregnancy induce [[congenital anomaly|anomalies]], [[Intrauterine growth restriction|impaired growth]] and [[intellectual disability]], and there may be an increased risk of [[childhood leukemia]] and other tumours in the offspring.&lt;ref name=arnon2011/&gt;

In males previously having undergone radiotherapy, there appears to be no increase in genetic defects or congenital malformations in their children conceived after therapy.&lt;ref name=arnon2011/&gt; However, the use of [[assisted reproductive technologies]] and [[micromanipulation technique]]s might increase this risk.&lt;ref name=arnon2011/&gt;

===Effects on pituitary system===
[[Hypopituitarism]] commonly develops after radiation therapy for sellar and parasellar neoplasms, extrasellar brain tumours, head and neck tumours, and following whole body irradiation for systemic malignancies.&lt;ref name=Fernandez_2009/&gt; Radiation-induced hypopituitarism mainly affects [[growth hormone]] and [[gonadal hormone]]s.&lt;ref name="Fernandez_2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fernandez A, Brada M, Zabuliene L, Karavitaki N, Wass JA | title = Radiation-induced hypopituitarism | journal = Endocr.

===Radiation therapy accidents===
There are rigorous procedures in place to minimise the risk of accidental overexposure of radiation therapy to patients. However, mistakes do occasionally occur; for example, the radiation therapy machine [[Therac-25]] was responsible for at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, where patients were given up to one hundred times the intended dose; two people were killed directly by the radiation overdoses. From 2005 to 2010, a hospital in [[Missouri]] overexposed 76 patients (most with brain cancer) during a five-year period because new radiation equipment had been set up incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/us/25radiation.html|title=Missouri Hospital Reports Errors in Radiation Doses|publisher=The New York Times|date=25 February 2010|access-date=26 February 2010 | first1=Walt | last1=Bogdanich | first2=Rebecca R. | last2=Ruiz | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although medical errors are exceptionally rare, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and other members of the radiation therapy treatment team are working to eliminate them. ASTRO has launched a safety initiative called  [https://www.astro.org/Patient-Care-and-Research/Patient-Safety/Target-Safely Target Safely] that, among other things, aims to record errors nationwide so that doctors can learn from each and every mistake and prevent them from happening. ASTRO also publishes a list of questions for patients to ask their doctors about radiation safety to ensure every treatment is as safe as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/questions/safetyquestions.aspx |title=What Questions Should I Ask My Doctor?: Questions to ask after treatment ends |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2010-09-22 |access-date=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412020804/http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/questions/safetyquestions.aspx |archive-date=2012-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in non-cancerous diseases==
[[File:DupuytrensRadiotherapyHamburg.jpg|thumb|The beam's eye view of the radiotherapy portal on the hand's surface with the lead shield cut-out placed in the machine's gantry]]

Radiation therapy is used to treat early stage [[Dupuytren's contracture|Dupuytren's disease]] and [[Plantar fibromatosis|Ledderhose disease]]. When Dupuytren's disease is at the nodules and cords stage or fingers are at a minimal deformation stage of less than 10 degrees, then radiation therapy is used to prevent further progress of the disease. Radiation therapy is also used post surgery in some cases to prevent the disease continuing to progress. Low doses of radiation are used typically three gray of radiation for five days, with a break of three months followed by another phase of three gray of radiation for five days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eaton|first1=Charles|last2=Seegenschmiedt|first2=M.

==Technique==

===Mechanism of action===
Radiation therapy works by damaging the [[DNA]] of cancerous cells. This DNA damage is caused by one of two types of energy, [[photon]] or [[charged particle]]. This damage is either direct or indirect [[ionization]] of the atoms which make up the DNA chain. Indirect [[ionization]] happens as a result of the ionization of water, forming [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], notably [[hydroxyl]] radicals, which then damage the DNA.

In photon therapy, most of the radiation effect is through free radicals. Cells have mechanisms for repairing single-strand DNA damage and [[double-stranded DNA]] damage. However, double-stranded DNA breaks are much more difficult to repair, and can lead to dramatic chromosomal abnormalities and genetic deletions. Targeting double-stranded breaks increases the probability that cells will undergo [[Apoptosis|cell death]]. Cancer cells are generally less [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] and more [[stem cell]]-like; they reproduce more than most healthy [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] cells, and have a diminished ability to repair sub-lethal damage. Single-strand DNA damage is then passed on through cell division; damage to the cancer cells' DNA accumulates, causing them to die or reproduce more slowly.

One of the major limitations of photon radiation therapy is that the cells of solid tumors become deficient in [[oxygen]]. Solid tumors can outgrow their blood supply, causing a low-oxygen state known as [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Oxygen is a potent [[radiosensitizer]], increasing the effectiveness of a given dose of radiation by forming DNA-damaging free radicals. Tumor cells in a hypoxic environment may be as much as 2 to 3 times more resistant to radiation damage than those in a normal oxygen environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harrison LB, Chadha M, Hill RJ, Hu K, Shasha D | title = Impact of tumor hypoxia and anemia on radiation therapy outcomes | journal = Oncologist | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 492–508 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12490737 | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.7-6-492 | url = http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12490737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much research has been devoted to overcoming hypoxia including the use of high pressure oxygen tanks, [[hyperthermia therapy]] (heat therapy which dilates blood vessels to the tumor site), blood substitutes that carry increased oxygen, hypoxic cell radiosensitizer drugs such as [[misonidazole]] and [[metronidazole]], and hypoxic [[cytotoxins]] (tissue poisons), such as [[tirapazamine]].  Newer research approaches are currently being studied, including preclinical and clinical investigations into the use of an [[oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound]] such as [[trans sodium crocetinate]] (TSC) as a  [[radiosensitizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sheehan JP, Shaffrey ME, Gupta B, Larner J, Rich JN, Park DM | title = Improving the radiosensitivity of radioresistant and hypoxic glioblastoma | journal = Future Oncology | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 1591–1601 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21062158 | doi = 10.2217/fon.10.123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charged particles such as [[proton]]s and [[boron]], [[carbon]], and [[neon]] ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET ([[linear energy transfer]]) and have an antitumor effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via direct energy transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue—the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the [[Bragg peak]] effect. See [[proton therapy]] for a good example of the different effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. [[charged particle therapy]]. This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRT's use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of secondary cancer induction.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis RE, Freedman DM, Ron E, Ries LAG, Hacker DG, Edwards BK, Tucker MA, Fraumeni JF Jr. (eds). New Malignancies Among Cancer Survivors: SEER Cancer Registries, 1973–2000. National Cancer Institute. NIH Publ. No. 05-5302. Bethesda, MD, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs makes any stray ionization very damaging (example: [[head and neck cancers]]).
This x-ray exposure is especially bad for children, due to their growing bodies, and they have a 30% chance of a second malignancy after 5 years post initial RT.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/fileadmin/ISS/PDF/Risikoanalyse/Georgetown/Robison.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dose===
The amount of radiation used in photon radiation therapy is measured in [[Gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy), and varies depending on the type and stage of cancer being treated. For curative cases, the typical dose for a solid epithelial tumor ranges from 60 to 80&amp;nbsp;Gy, while lymphomas are treated with 20 to 40&amp;nbsp;Gy.

Preventive (adjuvant) doses are typically around 45–60&amp;nbsp;Gy in 1.8–2&amp;nbsp;Gy fractions (for breast, head, and neck cancers.) Many other factors are considered by [[radiation oncologist]]s when selecting a dose, including whether the patient is receiving chemotherapy, patient comorbidities, whether radiation therapy is being administered before or after surgery, and the degree of success of surgery.

Delivery parameters of a prescribed dose are determined during [[treatment planning]] (part of [[dosimetry]]). Treatment planning is generally performed on dedicated computers using specialized treatment planning software. Depending on the radiation delivery method, several angles or sources may be used to sum to the total necessary dose. The planner will try to design a plan that delivers a uniform prescription dose to the tumor and minimizes dose to surrounding healthy tissues.

In radiation therapy, three-dimensional dose distributions may be evaluated using the [[dosimetry]] technique known as [[gel dosimetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baldock C, De Deene Y, Doran S, Ibbott G, Jirasek A, Lepage M, McAuley KB, Oldham M, Schreiner LJ | year = 2010 | title = Polymer gel dosimetry | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 55 | issue = 5| page = R1 | doi=10.1088/0031-9155/55/5/r01 | pmid=20150687 | pmc=3031873| bibcode=2010PMB....55R...1B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Fractionation
{{hatnote|This section only applies to photon radiotherapy although other types of radiation therapy may be fractionated}}
The total dose is fractionated (spread out over time) for several important reasons. Fractionation allows normal cells time to recover, while tumor cells are generally less efficient in repair between fractions. Fractionation also allows tumor cells that were in a relatively radio-resistant phase of the cell cycle during one treatment to cycle into a sensitive phase of the cycle before the next fraction is given. Similarly, tumor cells that were chronically or acutely hypoxic (and therefore more radioresistant) may reoxygenate between fractions, improving the tumor cell kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ang|first1=K. Kian|title=Altered fractionation trials in head and neck cancer|journal=Seminars in Radiation Oncology|date=October 1998|volume=8|issue=4|pages=230–236|doi=10.1016/S1053-4296(98)80020-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractionation regimens are individualised between different radiation therapy centers and even between individual doctors. In North America, Australia, and Europe, the typical fractionation schedule for adults is 1.8 to 2&amp;nbsp;Gy per day, five days a week. In some cancer types, prolongation of the fraction schedule over too long can allow for the tumor to begin repopulating, and for these tumor types, including head-and-neck and cervical squamous cell cancers, radiation treatment is preferably completed within a certain amount of time. For children, a typical fraction size may be 1.5 to 1.8&amp;nbsp;Gy per day, as smaller fraction sizes are associated with reduced incidence and severity of late-onset side effects in normal tissues.

In some cases, two fractions per day are used near the end of a course of treatment. This schedule, known as a concomitant boost regimen or hyperfractionation, is used on tumors that regenerate more quickly when they are smaller. In particular, tumors in the head-and-neck demonstrate this behavior.

Patients receiving [[palliative radiation]] to treat uncomplicated painful bone metastasis should not receive more than a single fraction of radiation.&lt;ref name="AAHPMfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine |author1-link =  American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine]] |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-academy-of-hospice-palliative-medicine/ |accessdate = August 1, 2013}}, which cites

;Schedules for fractionation
One fractionation schedule that is increasingly being used and continues to be studied is hypofractionation. This is a radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into large doses. Typical doses vary significantly by cancer type, from 2.2&amp;nbsp;Gy/fraction to 20&amp;nbsp;Gy/fraction, the latter being typical of stereotactic treatments (stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy, or SABR – also known as SBRT, or stereotactic body radiotherapy) for subcranial lesions, or SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery) for intracranial lesions. The rationale of hypofractionation is to reduce the probability of local recurrence by denying clonogenic cells the time they require to reproduce and also to exploit the radiosensitivity of some tumors.&lt;ref&gt;[Pollack, Alan, and Mansoor Ahmed . Hypofractionation: Scientific Concepts and Clinical Experiences. 1st. Ellicot City: LimiText Publishing, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, stereotactic treatments are intended to destroy clonogenic cells by a process of ablation – ''i.e.'' the delivery of a dose intended to destroy clonogenic cells directly, rather than to interrupt the process of clonogenic cell division repeatedly (apoptosis), as in routine radiotherapy.

==Types==
Historically, the three main divisions of radiation therapy are :
*[[external beam radiation therapy]] (EBRT or XRT) or teletherapy; 
*brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy; and 
*systemic radioisotope therapy or [[unsealed source radiotherapy]]. 
The differences relate to the position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel.

[[Particle therapy]] is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are [[proton]]s or heavier [[ions]].

===External beam radiation therapy===

{{Main|External beam radiation therapy}}

The following three sections refer to treatment using x-rays.

====Conventional external beam radiation therapy====

}}]]
Conventional external beam radiation therapy (2DXRT) is delivered via two-dimensional beams using kilovoltage therapy x-ray units or medical linear accelerators which generate high energy x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill R, Healy B, Holloway L, Kuncic Z, Thwaites D, Baldock C | title = Advances in kilovoltage x-ray beam dosimetry | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = R183-231 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24584183 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/59/6/R183 | bibcode = 2014PMB....59R.183H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thwaites DI, Tuohy JB | title = Back to the future: the history and development of the clinical linear accelerator | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 51 | issue = 13 | pages = R343-62 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16790912 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/51/13/R20 | bibcode = 2006PMB....51R.343T }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2DXRT mainly consists of a single beam of radiation delivered to the patient from several directions: often front or back, and both sides. ''Conventional'' refers to the way the treatment is ''planned'' or ''simulated'' on a specially calibrated diagnostic x-ray machine known as a simulator because it recreates the linear accelerator actions (or sometimes by eye), and to the usually well-established arrangements of the radiation beams to achieve a desired ''plan''. The aim of simulation is to accurately target or localize the volume which is to be treated. This technique is well established and is generally quick and reliable. The worry is that some high-dose treatments may be limited by the radiation toxicity capacity of healthy tissues which lie close to the target tumor volume. An example of this problem is seen in radiation of the prostate gland, where the sensitivity of the adjacent rectum limited the dose which could be safely prescribed using 2DXRT planning to such an extent that tumor control may not be easily achievable. Prior to the invention of the CT, physicians and physicists had limited knowledge about the true radiation dosage delivered to both cancerous and healthy tissue. For this reason, 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy is becoming the standard treatment for a number of tumor sites. More recently other forms of imaging are used including MRI, PET, SPECT and Ultrasound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lagendijk JJ, Raaymakers BW, Van den Berg CA, Moerland MA, Philippens ME, van Vulpen M | title = MR guidance in radiotherapy | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 59 | issue = 21 | pages = R349-69 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25322150 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/59/21/R349 | bibcode = 2014PMB....59R.349L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stereotactic radiation====

{{main|Radiosurgery}}

Stereotactic radiation is a specialized type of external beam radiation therapy. It uses focused radiation beams targeting a well-defined tumor using extremely detailed imaging scans. Radiation oncologists perform stereotactic treatments, often with the help of a neurosurgeon for tumors in the brain or spine.

There are two types of stereotactic radiation. '''Stereotactic radiosurgery''' (SRS) is when doctors use a single or several stereotactic radiation treatments of the brain or spine. '''Stereotactic body radiation therapy''' (SBRT) refers to one or several stereotactic radiation treatments with the body, such as the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.org/PressRoom/PressKit/AnnualMeeting/documents/Timmerman.pdf |title=American Society for Radiation Oncology |publisher=Astro.org |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613154749/http://astro.org/PressRoom/PressKit/AnnualMeeting/documents/Timmerman.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doctors say an advantage to stereotactic treatments is that they deliver the right amount of radiation to the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional treatments, which can often take 6 to 11 weeks. Plus treatments are given with extreme accuracy, which should limit the effect of the radiation on healthy tissues. One problem with stereotactic treatments is that they are only suitable for certain small tumors.

Stereotactic treatments can be confusing because many hospitals call the treatments by the name of the manufacturer rather than calling it SRS or SBRT. Brand names for these treatments include Axesse, [[Cyberknife]], [[Gamma Knife]], Novalis, Primatom, Synergy, [[X-Knife]], [[TomoTherapy]], Trilogy and [[Truebeam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/treatmenttypes/stereotacticradiation.aspx |title=Treatment Types: Stereotactic Radiation Therapy |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2010-01-04 |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509091107/http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/treatmenttypes/stereotacticradiation.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This list changes as equipment manufacturers continue to develop new, specialized technologies to treat cancers.

====Virtual simulation, and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy====

The planning of radiation therapy treatment has been revolutionized by the ability to delineate tumors and adjacent normal structures in three dimensions using specialized CT and/or MRI scanners and planning software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bucci MK, Bevan A, Roach M | title = Advances in radiation therapy: conventional to 3D, to IMRT, to 4D, and beyond | journal = CA Cancer J Clin | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–34 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15761080 | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.55.2.117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual simulation, the most basic form of planning, allows more accurate placement of radiation beams than is possible using conventional X-rays, where soft-tissue structures are often difficult to assess and normal tissues difficult to protect.

An enhancement of virtual simulation is '''3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT)''', in which the profile of each radiation beam is shaped to fit the profile of the target from a [[beam's eye view]] (BEV) using a [[multileaf collimator]] (MLC) and a variable number of beams. &lt;!--I took this out -- see discussion: The aim of this process is to improve the [[therapeutic index]] of the radiation therapy: by conforming the treatment volume--&gt;When the treatment volume conforms to the shape of the tumor, the relative toxicity of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues is reduced, allowing a higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor than conventional techniques would allow.&lt;ref name=camphausen/&gt;

==== Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) ====
[[File:Varian TruBeam.jpg|thumb|[[Varian Medical Systems|Varian]] TruBeam [[Linear Accelerator]], used for delivering IMRT]]
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced type of high-precision radiation that is the next generation of 3DCRT.&lt;ref name="Galvin"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Galvin JM, Ezzell G, Eisbrauch A, Yu C, Butler B, Xiao Y, Rosen I, Rosenman J, Sharpe M, Xing L, Xia P, Lomax T, Low DA, Palta J | title = Implementing IMRT in clinical practice: a joint document of the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine | journal = Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. | volume = 58 | issue = 5 | pages = 1616–34 | date = Apr 2004 | pmid = 15050343 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2003.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IMRT also improves the ability to conform the treatment volume to concave tumor shapes,&lt;ref name="camphausen" /&gt; for example when the tumor is wrapped around a vulnerable structure such as the spinal cord or a major organ or blood vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irsa.org/imrt.html |title=Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy |publisher=Irsa.org |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-controlled x-ray accelerators distribute precise radiation doses to malignant tumors or specific areas within the tumor. The pattern of radiation delivery is determined using highly tailored computing applications to perform [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and treatment simulation ([[Treatment Planning]]). The radiation dose is consistent with the 3-D shape of the tumor by controlling, or modulating, the radiation beam’s intensity. The radiation dose intensity is elevated near the gross tumor volume while radiation among the neighboring normal tissues is decreased or avoided completely. This results in better tumor targeting, lessened side effects, and improved treatment outcomes than even 3DCRT.

3DCRT is still used extensively for many body sites but the use of IMRT is growing in more complicated body sites such as CNS, head and neck, prostate, breast, and lung. Unfortunately, IMRT is limited by its need for additional time from experienced medical personnel. This is because physicians must manually delineate the tumors one CT image at a time through the entire disease site which can take much longer than 3DCRT preparation. Then, medical physicists and dosimetrists must be engaged to create a viable treatment plan. Also, the IMRT technology has only been used commercially since the late 1990s even at the most advanced cancer centers, so radiation oncologists who did not learn it as part of their residency programs must find additional sources of education before implementing IMRT.

Proof of improved survival benefit from either of these two techniques over conventional radiation therapy (2DXRT) is growing for many tumor sites, but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted. This is particularly the case for head and neck cancers in a series of pivotal trials performed by Professor [[Christopher Nutting]] of the Royal Marsden Hospital. Both techniques enable dose escalation, potentially increasing usefulness. There has been some concern, particularly with IMRT,&lt;ref name="pmid12694826"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hall EJ, Wuu CS | title = Radiation-induced second cancers: the impact of 3D-CRT and IMRT | journal = Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–8 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12694826 | doi = 10.1016/S0360-3016(03)00073-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about increased exposure of normal tissue to radiation and the consequent potential for secondary malignancy. Overconfidence in the accuracy of imaging may increase the chance of missing lesions that are invisible on the planning scans (and therefore not included in the treatment plan) or that move between or during a treatment (for example, due to respiration or inadequate patient immobilization). New techniques are being developed to better control this uncertainty—for example, real-time imaging combined with real-time adjustment of the therapeutic beams. This new technology is called [[image-guided radiation therapy]] (IGRT) or four-dimensional radiation therapy.

Another technique is the real-time tracking and localization of one or more small implantable electric devices implanted inside or close to the tumor. There are various types of medical implantable devices that are used for this purpose. It can be a magnetic transponder which senses the magnetic field generated by several transmitting coils, and then transmits the measurements back to the positioning system to determine the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wing-Fai Loke |author2=Tae-Young Choi |author3=Teimour Maleki |author4=Lech Papiez |author5=Babak Ziaie |author6=Byunghoo Jung |title=Magnetic Tracking System for Radiation Therapy  |journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems |year=2010 |doi= 10.1109/TBCAS.2010.2046737 |volume= 4 |issue= 4 |pages= 223–231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The implantable device can also be a small wireless transmitter sending out an RF signal which then will be received by a sensor array and used for localization and real-time tracking of the tumor position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=M.

==== Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) ====
Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is a radiation technique introduced in 2007&lt;ref name="pmid22011829"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Teoh M, Clark CH, Wood K, Whitaker S, Nisbet A | title = Volumetric modulated arc therapy: a review of current literature and clinical use in practice | journal = The British Journal of Radiology | volume = 84 | issue = 1007 | pages = 967-96 | date = Nov 2011 | pmid = 22011829 | doi = 10.1259/bjr/22373346 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can achieve highly conformal dose distributions on target volume coverage and sparing of normal tissues. The specificity of this technique is to modify three parameters during the treatment. VMAT delivers radiation by rotating gantry (usually 360° rotating fields with one or more arcs), changing speed and shape of the beam with a [[multileaf collimator]] (MLC) ("sliding window" system of moving) and fluence output rate (dose rate) of the medical linear accelerator. VMAT has an advantage in patient treatment, compared with conventional static field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), of reduced radiation delivery times.&lt;ref name="pmid20188427"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bertelsen A, Hansen CR, Johansen J, Brink C | title = Single Arc Volumetric modulated Arc therapy of head and neck cancer | journal = Radiotherapy and Oncology : Journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 142–8 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20188427 | doi = 10.1016/j.radonc.2010.01.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISSN:1748-717X-8-37"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = VanGestel D, VanVliet-Vroegindeweij C, VanDenHeuvel F, Crijns W, Coelmont A, DeOst B, Holt A, Lamers E, Geussens Y, Nuyts S, VanDenWeyngaert D, VanDenWyngaert T, Vermorken JB, Gregoire V | title = RapidArc, SmartArc and TomoHD compared with classical step and shoot and sliding window intensity modulated radiotherapy in an oropharyngeal cancer treatment plan comparison | journal = Radiation Oncology | volume = 8 | issue = 37 | date = Feb 2013 | doi = 10.1186/1748-717X-8-37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparisons between VMAT and conventional IMRT for their sparing of healthy tissues and Organs at Risk (OAR) depends upon the cancer type.

====Particle therapy====

{{Main|Particle therapy}}

In particle therapy ([[proton therapy]] being one example), energetic ionizing particles (protons or carbon ions) are directed at the target tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/brain-tumour-patient-unaware-treatment-was-available-on-nhs-1301570.html|title=Brain tumor patient 'unaware' treatment was available on NHS|work=[[The Independent]]|date=12 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622115602/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/brain-tumour-patient-unaware-treatment-was-available-on-nhs-1301570.html|archivedate=22 June 2009|first=Jeremy|last=Laurance|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dose increases while the particle penetrates the tissue, up to a maximum (the [[Bragg peak]]) that occurs near the end of the particle's [[Range (particle radiation)|range]], and it then drops to (almost) zero. The advantage of this energy deposition profile is that less energy is deposited into the healthy tissue surrounding the target tissue.

====Auger therapy====

{{Main|Auger therapy}}

[[Auger therapy]] (AT) makes use of a very high dose&lt;ref name="pmid1461197"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kereiakes JG, Rao DV | title = Auger electron dosimetry: report of AAPM Nuclear Medicine Committee Task Group No. 6 | journal = Med Phys | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 1359 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1461197 | doi =  10.1118/1.596925| last2 = Rao | bibcode = 1992MedPh..19.1359K }}&lt;/ref&gt; of ionizing radiation in situ that provides molecular modifications at an atomic scale. AT differs from conventional radiation therapy in several aspects; it neither relies upon radioactive nuclei to cause cellular radiation damage at a cellular dimension, nor engages multiple external pencil-beams from different directions to zero-in to deliver a dose to the targeted area with reduced dose outside the targeted tissue/organ locations. Instead, the in situ delivery of a very high dose at the molecular level using AT aims for in situ molecular modifications involving molecular breakages and molecular re-arrangements such as a change of stacking structures as well as cellular metabolic functions related to the said molecule structures.

===Contact x-ray brachytherapy===
Contact x-ray brachytherapy (also called "CXB", "electronic brachytherapy" or the "Papillon Technique") is a type of radiation therapy using kilovoltage [[X-ray]]s applied close to the tumour to treat [[rectal cancer]]. The process involves inserting the [[x-ray tube]] through the [[anus]] into the rectum and placing it against the cancerous tissue, then high doses of X-rays are emitted directly into the [[tumor cells|tumor]] at two weekly intervals.  It is typically used for treating early rectal cancer in patients who may not be candidates for surgery.&lt;ref name=NICE&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg532|title=Contact X-ray Brachytherapy for early rectal cancer|publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|first=|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VIieBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA109|title=Modern Management of Cancer of the Rectum|last1=Sun Myint|first1=Arthur|last2=Gerard|first2=Jean-Pierre|last3=Myerson|first3=Robert J.|date=2014|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9781447166092|editor1-last=Longo|editor1-first=Walter E. | name-list-format = vanc |location=|pages=109ff|language=en|chapter=Contact X-Ray Brachytherapy for Rectal Cancer|editor2-last=Reddy|editor2-first=Vikram|editor3-last=Audisio|editor3-first=Riccardo A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAPM-report"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/RPT_152.pdf | title = The 2007 AAPM response to the CRCPD request for recommendations for the CRCPD's model regulations for electronic brachytherapy | access-date = 17 April 2010 | author = American Association of Physicists in Medicine | authorlink =  |date= February 2009 |publisher = American Association of Physicists in Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 NICE review found the main side effect to be bleeding that occurred in about 38% of cases, and radiation-induced ulcer which occurred in 27% of cases.&lt;ref name=NICE/&gt;

===Brachytherapy (sealed source radiotherapy)===
{{Main|Brachytherapy}}
[[File:1 applicator.jpg|thumb|A SAVI brachytherapy device]]

Brachytherapy is delivered by placing radiation source(s) inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment for cervical,&lt;ref name="GEC-ESTRO-Cervix"&gt;

In brachytherapy, radiation sources are precisely placed directly at the site of the cancerous tumour. This means that the irradiation only affects a very localized area – exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is reduced. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over external beam radiation therapy – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localized radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.&lt;ref name="GEC-ESTRO-General" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart 2007"&gt;
{{Cite book | last = Stewart AJ | editor = Devlin P | year = 2007 | title = Brachytherapy. Applications and Techniques | chapter = Radiobiological concepts for brachytherapy | publisher = LWW | location = Philadelphia | id =  | displayauthors =  etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; A course of brachytherapy can often be completed in less time than other radiation therapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance of surviving cancer cells dividing and growing in the intervals between each radiation therapy dose.&lt;ref name="Stewart 2007" /&gt;

As one example of the localized nature of breast brachytherapy, the SAVI device delivers the radiation dose through multiple catheters, each of which can be individually controlled. This approach decreases the exposure of healthy tissue and resulting side effects, compared both to external beam radiation therapy and older methods of breast brachytherapy.&lt;ref name="pmid19744892"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yashar CM, Blair S, Wallace A, Scanderbeg D | title = Initial clinical experience with the Strut-Adjusted Volume Implant brachytherapy applicator for accelerated partial breast irradiation | journal = Brachytherapy | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 367–72 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19744892 | doi = 10.1016/j.brachy.2009.03.190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unsealed source radiotherapy (systemic radioisotope therapy)===
{{Main|Unsealed source radiotherapy}}
Systemic radioisotope therapy (RIT) is a form of targeted therapy. Targeting can be due to the chemical properties of the isotope such as radioiodine which is specifically absorbed by the thyroid gland a thousandfold better than other bodily organs. Targeting can also be achieved by attaching the radioisotope to another molecule or antibody to guide it to the target tissue. The radioisotopes are delivered through [[Route of administration|infusion]] (into the bloodstream) or ingestion. Examples are the infusion of [[metaiodobenzylguanidine]] (MIBG) to treat [[neuroblastoma]], of oral [[iodine-131]] to treat [[thyroid cancer]] or [[thyrotoxicosis]], and of hormone-bound [[lutetium-177]] and [[yttrium-90]] to treat [[neuroendocrine tumors]] ([[peptide receptor radionuclide therapy]]).

Another example is the injection of yttrium-90 radioactive glass or resin microspheres into the [[Hepatic artery proper|hepatic artery]] to radioembolize liver tumors or liver metastases.  These microspheres are used for the treatment approach known as [[selective internal radiation therapy]]. The microspheres are approximately 30&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] in diameter (about one-third of a human hair) and are delivered directly into the artery supplying blood to the tumors. These treatments begin by guiding a [[catheter]] up through the femoral artery in the leg, navigating to the desired target site and administering treatment. The blood feeding the tumor will carry the microspheres directly to the tumor enabling a more selective approach than traditional systemic chemotherapy. There are currently two different kinds of microspheres: [[SIR-Spheres]] and [[TheraSphere]].

A major use of systemic radioisotope therapy is in the treatment of [[bone metastasis]] from cancer. The radioisotopes travel selectively to areas of damaged bone, and spare normal undamaged bone. Isotopes commonly used in the treatment of bone metastasis are [[radium-223]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Christopher |title=Alpha Emiiter Radium-223 and Survival in Metastatic Prostate Cancer |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=July 18, 2013 |volume=369 |issue=3 |pages=213-23 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1213755}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[strontium-89]] and [[Samarium (153Sm) lexidronam|samarium (&lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Sm) lexidronam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sartor O | title = Overview of samarium sm 153 lexidronam in the treatment of painful metastatic bone disease | journal = Rev Urol | volume = 6 Suppl 10 | issue = Suppl 10 | pages = S3–S12 | year = 2004 | pmid = 16985930 | pmc = 1472939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved [[ibritumomab tiuxetan]] (Zevalin), which is an anti-[[CD20]] [[monoclonal antibody]] conjugated to yttrium-90.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01138.html Fda Approves First Radiopharmaceutical Product To Treat Non-Hodgkin’S Lymphoma] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119111338/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01138.html |date=January 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, the FDA approved the [[tositumomab]]/iodine (&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I) tositumomab regimen (Bexxar), which is a combination of an iodine-131 labelled and an unlabelled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cder/biologics/products/tosicor062703.htm Tositumomab and Iodine I 131 Tositumomab – Product Approval Information – Licensing Action] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513024727/http://www.fda.gov/cder/biologics/products/tosicor062703.htm |date=May 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These medications were the first agents of what is known as [[radioimmunotherapy]], and they were approved for the treatment of refractory [[non-Hodgkins lymphoma]].

===Intraoperative radiotherapy===
{{main|Intraoperative radiation therapy}}
[[Intraoperative radiation therapy]] (IORT) is applying therapeutic levels of radiation to a target area, such as a [[cancerous|cancer]] tumor, while the area is exposed during [[surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dutta SW, Showalter SL, Showalter TN, Libby B, Trifiletti DM | title = Intraoperative radiation therapy for breast cancer patients: current perspectives | journal = Breast Cancer | volume = 9 | pages = 257–263 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28458578 | pmc = 5402914 | doi = 10.2147/BCTT.S112516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rationale====
The rationale for IORT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the targeted area with minimal exposure of surrounding tissues which are displaced or shielded during the IORT. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumor have several drawbacks: The tumor bed where the highest dose should be applied is frequently missed due to the complex localization of the wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay between the surgical removal of the tumor and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumor cells. These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumor cells. Another aspect is that wound fluid has a stimulating effect on tumor cells. IORT was found to inhibit the stimulating effects of wound fluid.&lt;ref name="pmid18316551"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belletti B, Vaidya JS, D'Andrea S, Entschladen F, Roncadin M, Lovat F, Berton S, Perin T, Candiani E, Reccanello S, Veronesi A, Canzonieri V, Trovò MG, Zaenker KS, Colombatti A, Baldassarre G, Massarut S | title = Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy impairs the stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion caused by surgical wounding | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 1325–32 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18316551 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deep inspiration breath-hold ===
[[Deep inspiration breath-hold]] (DIBH) is a method of delivering radiotherapy while limiting radiation exposure to the heart and lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanley J, Debois MM, Mah D, Mageras GS, Raben A, Rosenzweig K, Mychalczak B, Schwartz LH, Gloeggler PJ, Lutz W, Ling CC, Leibel SA, Fuks Z, Kutcher GJ | title = Deep inspiration breath-hold technique for lung tumors: the potential value of target immobilization and reduced lung density in dose escalation | journal = International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 603–11 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10524412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used primarily for treating left-sided breast cancer. The technique involves a patient holding their breath during treatment. There are two basic methods of performing DIBH: free-breathing breath-hold and spirometry-monitored deep inspiration breath hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deep Inspiration Breath-hold|url = http://www.genesiscare.co.uk/cancer-treatment/radiotherapy/dibh|publisher= Genesis Care|access-date = 14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:X-ray treatment of tuberculosis 1910.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|X-ray treatment of [[tuberculosis]] in 1910.  Before the 1920s, the hazards of radiation were not understood, and it was used to treat a wide range of diseases. ]]
{{Main|History of radiation therapy}}

Medicine has used radiation therapy as a treatment for cancer for more than 100 years, with its earliest roots traced from the discovery of x-rays in 1895 by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]].&lt;ref name="UAB"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www3.ccc.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=68504 | title=University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center, History of Radiation Oncology|format=from the [[Digital time capsule|Wayback Machine]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080105043216/http://www3.ccc.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=68504 |archivedate = 2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Emil Grubbe]] of Chicago was possibly the first American physician to use x-rays to treat cancer, beginning in 1896.&lt;ref name=pioneer&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pioneer in X-Ray Therapy | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] |series=New Series | volume = 125 | date = 4 January 1957 | pages=18–19 | issue = 3236 | bibcode =   1957Sci...125T..18.| doi = 10.1126/science.125.3236.18 | jstor = 1752791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of radiation therapy began to grow in the early 1900s largely due to the groundbreaking work of [[Nobel Prize]]–winning scientist [[Marie Curie]] (1867–1934), who discovered the radioactive elements [[polonium]] and [[radium]] in 1898. This began a new era in medical treatment and research.&lt;ref name="UAB"/&gt;  Through the 1920s the hazards of radiation exposure were not understood, and little protection was used. Radium was believed to have wide curative powers and radiotherapy was applied to many diseases.

Prior to World War 2, the only practical sources of radiation for radiotherapy were [[radium]], its "emanation", [[radon]] gas, and the [[x-ray tube]].  [[External beam radiotherapy]] (teletherapy) began at the turn of the century with relatively low voltage (&lt;150&amp;nbsp;kV) x-ray machines.  It was found that while superficial tumors could be treated with low voltage x-rays, more penetrating, higher energy beams were required to reach tumors inside the body, requiring higher voltages.  [[Orthovoltage X-rays]], which used tube voltages of 200-500&amp;nbsp;kV, began to be used during the 1920s.  To reach the most deeply buried tumors without exposing intervening skin and tissue to dangerous radiation doses required rays with energies of 1&amp;nbsp;MV or above, called "megavolt" radiation.  Producing megavolt x-rays required [[voltage]]s on the x-ray tube of 3 to 5 million [[volt]]s, which required huge expensive installations.  Megavoltage x-ray units were first built in the late 1930s but because of cost were limited to a few institutions.    One of the first, installed at [[St. Bartholomew's hospital]], London in 1937 and used until 1960, used a 30 foot long x-ray tube and weighed 10 tons.    Radium produced megavolt [[gamma ray]]s, but was extremely rare and expensive due to its low occurrence in ores.  In 1937 the entire world supply of radium for radiotherapy was 50 grams, valued at £800,000, or $50 million in 2005 dollars.

The invention of the [[nuclear reactor]] in the [[Manhattan Project]] during World War 2 made possible the production of artificial [[radioisotope]]s for radiotherapy.  [[Cobalt therapy]], [[teletherapy]] machines using megavolt gamma rays emitted by [[cobalt-60]], a radioisotope produced by irradiating ordinary cobalt metal in a reactor, revolutionized the field between the 1950s and the early 1980s.  Cobalt machines were relatively cheap, robust and simple to use, although due to its 5.27 year [[half-life]] the cobalt had to be replaced about every 5 years.

Medical [[linear particle accelerator]]s, developed since the 1940s, began replacing x-ray and cobalt units in the 1980s and these older therapies are now declining. The first medical linear accelerator was used at the [[Hammersmith Hospital]] in London in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thwaites DI, Tuohy JB | title = Back to the future: the history and development of the clinical linear accelerator | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 51 | issue = 13 | pages = R343-62 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16790912 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/51/13/R20 | bibcode = 2006PMB....51R.343T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linear accelerators can produce higher energies, have more collimated beams, and do not produce radioactive waste with its attendant disposal problems like radioisotope therapies.

With [[Godfrey Hounsfield]]’s invention of [[computed tomography]] (CT) in 1971, three-dimensional planning became a possibility and created a shift from 2-D to 3-D radiation delivery. CT-based planning allows physicians to more accurately determine the dose distribution using axial tomographic images of the patient's anatomy.   The advent of new imaging technologies, including [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) in the 1970s and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) in the 1980s, has moved radiation therapy from 3-D conformal to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and to [[image-guided radiation therapy]] (IGRT) [[tomotherapy]]. These advances allowed radiation oncologists to better see and target tumors, which have resulted in better treatment outcomes, more organ preservation and fewer side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtanswers.com/aboutus/history.aspx |title=History of Radiation Therapy: The Evolution of Therapeutic Radiology |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301041554/http://www.rtanswers.com/aboutus/history.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While access to radiotherapy is improving globally, more than half of patients in low and [[Developing country|middle income countries]] still do not have available access to the therapy as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21728893-science-will-win-technical-battle-against-cancer-only-half-fight-closing|title=Closing in on cancer|date=16 September 2017|work=The Economist|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5683">Roger de Piles's '''''L'Abrégé de la vie des peintres...avec un traité du peintre parfait''''' (''The Art of Painting and the Lives of the Painters''), was a major art biography of painters. It was written by the French spy [[Roger de Piles]]. In 1692, during the [[War of the League of Augsburg]], he was arrested in the Hague carrying a false passport and imprisoned for the next five years, where he wote his ''L'Abrégé'' in 7 parts; 1) Sketch of the perfect painter, 2) Greek painters; 3) Painters from Rome &amp; Florence; 4) Painters from Venice; 5) Painters from Lombardy; 6) Painters from Germany and the Low Countries; 7) Painters from France and ending with his famous "Balance of painters". The book was finally published in 1699 following his appointment as Conseiller Honoraire to the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] in Paris.

A '''supra-entity''' is a conceptual element derived from the [[Entity-relationship model|Entity-Relationship]] (E-R) technique for [[information system]] modeling. It is similar to an entity, but it is defined at a higher level, encompassing individual entity occurrences, their parts, groups and groups of parts or parts of groups.

The concepts '''supra-entity''', '''[[supra-relationship]]''' and '''[[supra-attribute]]''' were created and published by González &amp; Muller in their work “''Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management ''”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and applied for the first time in this work to conceptually model the key elements and interrelationships of “business” reality.

Supra-entities, supra-relationships and supra-attributes have the objective of covering the diversity of situations and perspectives existing in reality, through the integrated representation at a higher level of individual occurrences, its multiple parts and groups of entities and relationships according to different criteria, its structures, its properties or attributes and its association with other supra-entities at any level of partition or grouping.

== Supra-entity ==
[[File:Supra-entity.png|right|frameless|453x453px]]

A supra-entity is formed by the individual entities, its multiple structures of entity parts, its multiple structures of entity groups and its multiple structures of groups of entity parts or parts of entity groups, associated with each other in a closed squared structure, as shown in the attached diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=39–40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representation on the multiple structures of parts, groups, groups of parts or parts of entity groups that form the supra-entity is done through '''strips''' connecting the different elements, instead of the usual line symbol used for a single structure in the entity-relationship models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=25–39|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, supra-entity ''Products'' in a business sector is as shown in the next diagram:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=61–64|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Supra-entity Products.png|frameless|529x529px]]

== Application to innovation ==
In addition to its application to modeling and development of databases and information systems, supra-entities and supra-relationships allow a redefinition of the concept of '''[[innovation]]''', its degrees and types, with clarity and amplitude, which facilitates generation of ideas and innovation capacity, both in general and business.

'''Innovation''' defined in a supra-entity domain or scope consists of the creation, generation or introduction of new occurrences of supra-entity elements with good results or success, and which are first invention (major innovation) or improved (minor or incremental innovation), not including those new occurrences that replicate to other similar previous ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=122–124|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Supra-entity innovation.png|frameless|718x718px]]

For example, if we apply this definition of innovation to the supra-entity ''Products'', we obtain the '''product innovations''', which consist of the creation, generation or introduction in the market of new element occurrences of the supra-entity ''Products'' with good results or success, and which are first invention (major innovation) or improved (minor or incremental innovation), not including those new occurrences that replicate to other similar previous ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=127|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Products supra-entity innovation.png|frameless|718x718px]]

Business innovation is traditionally identified with the introduction and marketing of new or improved products or processes in the market. But innovation does not necessarily require being technological. You can innovate by identifying new needs, new customer segments, new ways of getting the product to the customer, new forms of agreements or contracting, new environments, etc.

In summary, it is possible to innovate on the different supra-entities and supra-relationships that constitute the Business Entity-Relationship Model, achieving different types of innovations and increasing the innovation capacity of the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management|last=González|first=Alberto|last2=Müller|first2=Luis|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9788461743445|location=|pages=124–126|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for [[libration]] effects, this results in the Moon keeping the same face turned toward Earth, as seen in the left figure. (The Moon is shown in polar view, and is not drawn to scale.) If the Moon were not rotating at all, it would alternately show its near and far sides to Earth, while moving around Earth in orbit, as shown in the right figure.]]

'''Tidal locking''' (also called '''gravitational locking''' or '''captured rotation''') occurs when the long-term interaction between a pair of co-orbiting [[astronomical body|astronomical bodies]] drives the rotation rate of at least one of them into the state where there is no more net transfer of [[angular momentum]] between this body (e.g. a planet) and its orbit around the second body (e.g. a star); this condition of "no net transfer" must be satisfied over the course of one orbit around the second body.&lt;ref name=Barnes_2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heller_Leconte_Barnes_2011/&gt; This does not mean that the rotation and spin rates are always perfectly synchronized throughout an orbit, as there can be some back and forth transfer over the course of an orbit.

This effect arises from the [[gravitational gradient]] (tidal force) between the co-orbiting bodies, acting over a sufficiently long period of time.

In the special case where the [[orbital eccentricity]] and [[obliquity]] are nearly zero, tidal locking results in one hemisphere of the revolving object constantly facing its partner, an effect known as '''synchronous rotation'''.&lt;ref name=Barnes_2010&gt;{{cite book

A tidally locked body in synchronous rotation takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner.

Usually, only the [[natural satellite|satellite]] is tidally locked to the larger body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Will Earth Lock to the Moon?|url=http://www.universetoday.com/128350/will-earth-lock-moon/|website=Universe Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if both the mass difference between the two bodies and the distance between them are relatively small, each may be tidally locked to the other; this is the case for [[Pluto]] and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]].

This effect is employed to [[gravity-gradient stabilization|stabilize]] some artificial satellites.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

One form of hypothetical tidal locked planets are [[eyeball planet]]s, that in turn are divided into "hot" and "cold" eyeball planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nautil.us/blog/forget-earth_likewell-first-find-aliens-on-eyeball-planets|title=Forget "Earth-Like"—We’ll First Find Aliens on Eyeball Planets|publisher=Nautilus|language=English|author=Sean Raymond|date=20 February 2015|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:Árapály forgatónyomaték.png|thumbnail|If the tidal bulges on a body (green) are misaligned with the major axis (red), the tidal forces (blue) exert a net torque on that body that twists the body toward the direction of realignment]]
Consider a pair of co-orbiting objects, A and B. The change in [[Rotation period|rotation rate]] necessary to tidally lock body B to the larger body A is caused by the [[torque]] applied by A's [[gravity]] on bulges it has induced on B by [[tidal force]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Physics and Chemistry of the Solar System | first1=John | last1=Lewis | publisher=Academic Press | year=2012 | isbn=0323145841 | pages=242–243 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35uwarLgVLsC&amp;pg=PA242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gravitational force from object A upon B will vary with distance, being greatest at the nearest surface to A and least at the most distant. This creates a gravitational [[gradient]] across object B that will distort its [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] shape slightly. The body of object B will become elongated along the axis oriented toward A, and conversely, slightly reduced in dimension in directions [[orthogonal]] to this axis. The elongated distortions are known as tidal bulges. (For the solid Earth, these bulges can reach displacements of up to around {{Convert|0.4|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Impact of solid Earth tide models on GPS coordinate and tropospheric time series | display-authors=1 | last1=Watson | first1=C. | last2=Tregoning | first2=P. | last3=Coleman | first3=R. | journal=Geophysical Research Letters | volume=33 | issue=8 | date=April 2006 | doi=10.1029/2005GL025538 | bibcode=2006GeoRL..33.8306W | url=http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3437/1/2005GL0255381.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;) When B is not yet tidally locked, the bulges travel over its surface due to orbital motions, with one of the two "high" tidal bulges traveling close to the point where body A is overhead. For large astronomical bodies that are nearly [[Sphericity|spherical]] due to self-gravitation, the tidal distortion produces a slightly [[prolate spheroid]], i.e. an axially symmetric [[ellipsoid]] that is elongated along its major axis. Smaller bodies also experience distortion, but this distortion is less regular.

The material of B exerts resistance to this periodic reshaping caused by the tidal force. In effect, some time is required to reshape B to the gravitational equilibrium shape, by which time the forming bulges have already been carried some distance away from the A–B axis by B's rotation. Seen from a vantage point in space, the points of maximum bulge extension are displaced from the axis oriented toward A. If B's rotation period is shorter than its orbital period, the bulges are carried forward of the axis oriented toward A in the direction of rotation, whereas if B's rotation period is longer, the bulges instead lag behind.

Because the bulges are now displaced from the A–B axis, A's gravitational pull on the mass in them exerts a torque on B. The torque on the A-facing bulge acts to bring B's rotation in line with its orbital period, whereas the "back" bulge, which faces away from A, acts in the opposite sense. However, the bulge on the A-facing side is closer to A than the back bulge by a distance of approximately B's diameter, and so experiences a slightly stronger gravitational force and torque. The net resulting torque from both bulges, then, is always in the direction that acts to synchronize B's rotation with its orbital period, leading eventually to tidal locking.

===Orbital changes===
[[File:MoonTorque.jpg|thumb|alt=Tidal Locking|If rotational frequency is larger than orbital frequency, a small torque counteracting the rotation arises, eventually locking the frequencies (situation depicted in green)]]
The [[angular momentum]] of the whole A–B system is conserved in this process, so that when B slows down and loses rotational angular momentum, its ''orbital'' angular momentum is boosted by a similar amount (there are also some smaller effects on A's rotation). This results in a raising of B's orbit about A in tandem with its rotational slowdown. For the other case where B starts off rotating too slowly, tidal locking both speeds up its rotation, and ''lowers'' its orbit.

===Locking of the larger body===
{{See also|Synchronous orbit}}
The tidal locking effect is also experienced by the larger body A, but at a slower rate because B's gravitational effect is weaker due to B's smaller mass. For example, Earth's rotation is gradually being slowed by the Moon, by an amount that becomes noticeable over geological time as revealed in the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current estimations are that this (together with the tidal influence of the Sun) has helped lengthen the Earth day from about 6 hours to the current 24 hours (over ≈ ⁠4½ billion years). Currently, [[atomic clock]]s show that Earth's day lengthens by about 15 microseconds every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Ray|first = R.|date = 15 May 2001|url = http://bowie.gsfc.nasa.gov/ggfc/tides/intro.html|title = Ocean Tides and the Earth's Rotation|publisher = IERS Special Bureau for Tides|accessdate =17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given enough time, this would create a mutual tidal locking between Earth and the Moon, where the length of a [[day]] has increased and the length of a [[lunar month]] has shortened until the two are the same. However, Earth is not expected to become tidally locked to the Moon before the Sun becomes a [[red giant]] and engulfs Earth and the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Murray | first1 = C.

&lt;/ref&gt;

For bodies of similar size the effect may be of comparable size for both, and both may become tidally locked to each other on a much shorter timescale. An example is the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]] and its satellite [[Charon (moon)|Charon]]. They have already reached a state where Charon is only visible from one hemisphere of Pluto and vice versa.&lt;ref name=Michaely2017&gt;{{citation | title=On the Existence of Regular and Irregular Outer Moons Orbiting the Pluto-Charon System | display-authors=1 | last1=Michaely | first1=Erez | last2=Perets | first2=Hagai B. | last3=Grishin | first3=Evgeni | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=836 | issue=1 | id=27 | pages=7 | date=February 2017 | doi=10.3847/1538-4357/aa52b2 | bibcode=2017ApJ...836...27M | arxiv=1506.08818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eccentric orbits===

For orbits that do not have an eccentricity close to zero, the [[rotation]] rate tends to become locked with the [[orbital speed]] when the body is at [[periapsis]], which is the point of strongest tidal interaction between the two objects. If the orbiting object has a companion, this third body can cause the rotation rate of the parent object to vary in an oscillatory manner. This interaction can also drive an increase in orbital eccentricity of the orbiting object around the primary &amp;ndash; an effect known as eccentricity pumping.&lt;ref name=Correia2012&gt;{{citation

In some cases where the orbit is [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentric]] and the tidal effect is relatively weak, the smaller body may end up in a so-called ''spin–orbit resonance'', rather than being tidally locked. Here, the ratio of the rotation period of a body to its own orbital period is some simple fraction different from 1:1. A well known case is the rotation of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], which is locked to its own orbit around the Sun in a 3:2 resonance.

Many exoplanets (especially the close-in ones) are expected to be in spin–orbit resonances higher than 1:1. A Mercury-like terrestrial planet can, for example, become captured in a 3:2, 2:1, or 5:2 spin–orbit resonance, with the probability of each being dependent on the orbital eccentricity.&lt;ref name=Makarov2012&gt;{{citation

==Occurrence==

===Moons===
[[File:Synchronous rotation.svg|thumb|Due to tidal locking, the inhabitants of the central body will never be able to see the satellite's green area.]]
Most major moons in the [[Solar System]] − the [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System|gravitationally rounded satellites]] − are tidally locked with their primaries, because they orbit very closely and tidal force increases rapidly (as a [[cubic function]]) with decreasing distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schutz|first1=Bernard|title=Gravity from the Ground Up|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521455060|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_T0xxhDcsIC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2003-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable exceptions are the irregular outer satellites of the [[gas giant]]s, which orbit much farther away than the large well-known moons.

[[Pluto]] and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] are an extreme example of a tidal lock. Charon is a relatively large moon in comparison to its primary and also has a very close [[orbit]]. This results in Pluto and Charon being mutually tidally locked. Pluto's other moons are not tidally locked; [[Styx (moon)|Styx]], [[Nix (moon)|Nix]], [[Kerberos (moon)|Kerberos]], and [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]] all rotate chaotically due to the influence of Charon.

The tidal locking situation for [[asteroid moon]]s is largely unknown, but closely orbiting binaries are expected to be tidally locked, as well as [[Contact binary (asteroid)|contact binaries]].

====The Moon====
[[File:FullMoon2010.jpg|thumb|Because the [[Moon]] is 1:1 tidally locked, only [[near side of the Moon|one side]] is visible from [[Earth]].]]
The Moon's rotation and orbital periods are tidally locked with each other, so no matter when the Moon is observed from Earth the same hemisphere of the Moon is always seen. The [[Far side (Moon)|far side of the Moon]] was not seen until 1959, when photographs of most of the far side were transmitted from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spacecraft [[Luna 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oct. 7, 1959 – Our First Look at the Far Side of the Moon|url=http://www.universetoday.com/105326/oct-7-1959-our-first-look-at-the-far-side-of-the-moon/|website=Universe Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Earth is observed from the moon, the Earth does not appear to translate across the sky but appears to remain in the same place, rotating on its own axis.

Despite the Moon's rotational and orbital periods being exactly locked, about 59% of the Moon's total surface may be seen with repeated observations from Earth due to the phenomena of [[libration]] and [[parallax]]. Librations are primarily caused by the Moon's varying orbital speed due to the [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] of its orbit: this allows up to about 6° more along its perimeter to be seen from Earth. Parallax is a geometric effect: at the surface of Earth we are offset from the line through the centers of Earth and Moon, and because of this we can observe a bit (about 1°) more around the side of the Moon when it is on our local horizon.

===Planets===
It was thought for some time that [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] was in synchronous rotation with the Sun. This was because whenever Mercury was best placed for observation, the same side faced inward. Radar observations in 1965 demonstrated instead that Mercury has a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun, which results in the same positioning at those observation points. Modeling has demonstrated that Mercury was captured into the 3:2 spin–orbit state very early in its history, within 20 (and more likely even 10) million years after its formation.&lt;ref name=Noyelles2012&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103514003078 | bibcode=2014Icar..241...26N | last1=Noyelles | first1=Benoit | last2=Frouard | first2=Julien | last3=Makarov | first3=Valeri V. | last4=Efroimsky | first4=Michael | last-author-amp=yes | title=Spin–orbit evolution of Mercury revisited | journal=Icarus | date=2014 | volume=241 | doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2014.05.045 | pages=26–44 | arxiv = 1307.0136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Venus]]'s 583.92-day interval between successive close approaches to Earth is equal to 5.001444 Venusian solar days, making approximately the same face visible from Earth at each close approach. Whether this relationship arose by chance or is the result of some kind of tidal locking with Earth is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gold |first1=T. |last2=Soter |first2=S. |date=1969 |title=Atmospheric tides and the resonant rotation of Venus |journal=Icarus |volume=11 |pages=356–366|bibcode=1969Icar...11..356G |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(69)90068-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Proxima Centauri b]], the "Earth-like planet" discovered in 2016 that orbits around the star [[Proxima Centauri]] is tidally locked, either in synchronized rotation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Earth-like planet found orbiting the star next door |url=http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/technology/earth-like-planet-proxima-centauri-1.3733882 |agency=Associated Press |date=2016-08-24 |access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise expresses a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance like that of Mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Numerical simulation of possible surface temperatures on Proxima b (synchronous rotation)|url=https://www.eso.org/public/unitedkingdom/videos/eso1629g/|publisher=ESO|year=2016|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stars===
Close [[binary star]]s throughout the universe are expected to be tidally locked with each other, and [[extrasolar planet]]s that have been found to orbit their primaries extremely closely are also thought to be tidally locked to them. An unusual example, confirmed by [[MOST (satellite)|MOST]], may be [[Tau Boötis]], a star that is probably tidally locked by its planet [[Tau Boötis b]].&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/050523_star_tide.html |title=Role Reversal: Planet Controls a Star |date=2005-05-23 |first=Michael |last=Schirber |publisher=space.com |accessdate=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the tidal locking is almost certainly mutual.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} However, since stars are gaseous bodies that can rotate with a different rate at different latitudes, the tidal lock is with Tau Boötis's [[magnetic field]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Timescale==
An estimate of the time for a body to become tidally locked can be obtained using the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= B. Gladman| display-authors= etal| title= ''Synchronous Locking of Tidally Evolving Satellites''| journal= Icarus| date= 1996| volume= 122| pages= 166–192 | doi = 10.1006/icar.1996.0117| bibcode=1996Icar..122..166G}} (See pages 169-170 of this article. Formula (9) is quoted here, which comes from S. J. Peale, ''Rotation histories of the natural satellites'', in {{cite book | editor= J. A.

t_{\text{lock}} \approx \frac{\omega a^6 I Q}{3 G m_p^2 k_2 R^5}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is the initial spin rate expressed in [[radian]]s [[Radian per second|per second]],
* &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[semi-major axis]] of the motion of the satellite around the planet (given by the average of the [[periapsis]] and [[apoapsis]] distances),
* &lt;math&gt;I\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\approx 0.4 m_s R^2&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] of the satellite, where &lt;math&gt;m_s\,&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the satellite and &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; is the mean radius of the satellite,
* &lt;math&gt;Q\,&lt;/math&gt; is the dissipation function of the satellite,
* &lt;math&gt;G\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]],
* &lt;math&gt;m_p\,&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the planet, and
* &lt;math&gt;k_2\,&lt;/math&gt; is the tidal [[Love number]] of the satellite.

&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; are generally very poorly known except for the Moon, which has &lt;math&gt;k_2/Q=0.0011&lt;/math&gt;. For a really rough estimate it is common to take &lt;math&gt;Q \approx 100&lt;/math&gt; (perhaps conservatively, giving overestimated locking times), and
:&lt;math&gt;
k_2 \approx \frac{1.5}{1+\frac{19\mu}{2\rho g R}},
&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;\rho\,&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the satellite
* &lt;math&gt;g\approx Gm_s/R^2&lt;/math&gt; is the surface gravity of the satellite
* &lt;math&gt;\mu\,&lt;/math&gt; is the rigidity of the satellite. This can be roughly taken as 3{{e|10}}&amp;nbsp;N&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for rocky objects and 4{{e|9}}&amp;nbsp;N&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for icy ones.

Even knowing the size and density of the satellite leaves many parameters that must be estimated (especially ''&amp;omega;'', ''Q'', and ''&amp;mu;''), so that any calculated locking times obtained are expected to be inaccurate, even to factors of ten. Further, during the tidal locking phase the semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; may have been significantly different from that observed nowadays due to subsequent [[tidal acceleration]], and the locking time is extremely sensitive to this value.

Because the uncertainty is so high, the above formulas can be simplified to give a somewhat less cumbersome one. By assuming that the satellite is spherical, &lt;math&gt;k_2\ll1\, , Q = 100&lt;/math&gt;, and it is sensible to guess one revolution every 12 hours in the initial non-locked state (most asteroids have rotational periods between about 2 hours and about 2 days)

:&lt;math&gt;
t_{\text{lock}} \approx 6\ \frac{a^6R\mu}{m_sm_p^2} \times 10^{10}\ \text{years},
&lt;/math&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

with masses in kilograms, distances in meters, and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; in newtons per meter squared; &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; can be roughly taken as 3{{e|10}}&amp;nbsp;N&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for rocky objects and 4{{e|9}}&amp;nbsp;N&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for icy ones.

There is an extremely strong dependence on semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

For the locking of a primary body to its satellite as in the case of Pluto, the satellite and primary body parameters can be swapped.

One conclusion is that, ''other things being equal'' (such as &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;), a large moon will lock faster than a smaller moon at the same orbital distance from the planet because &lt;math&gt;m_s\,&lt;/math&gt; grows as the cube of the satellite radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. A possible example of this is in the Saturn system, where [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]] is not tidally locked, whereas the larger [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], which orbits at a greater distance, is. However, this is not clear cut because Hyperion also experiences strong driving from the nearby [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], which forces its rotation to be chaotic.

The above formulae for the timescale of locking may be off by orders of magnitude, because they ignore the frequency dependence of &lt;math&gt;k_2/Q&lt;/math&gt;. More importantly, they may be inapplicable to viscous binaries (double stars, or double asteroids that are rubble), because the spin–orbit dynamics of such bodies is defined mainly by their viscosity, not rigidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/150/4/98 |bibcode=2015AJ....150...98E |author=Efroimsky, M.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Tidal Evolution of Asteroidal Binaries.

==Bodies likely to be locked==

===Solar System===
Based on comparison between the likely time needed to lock a body to its primary, and the time it has been in its present orbit (comparable with the age of the Solar System for most planetary moons), a number of moons are thought to be locked. However their rotations are not known or not known enough. These are:

'''Trompenaars' model of national culture differences''' is a framework for [[cross-cultural communication]] applied to general business and management, developed by [[Fons Trompenaars]] and [[Charles Hampden-Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;Trompenaars, F., Hampden-Turner, C. (1997) ''Riding the Waves of Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G. (1996) "Riding the waves of commerce: a test of Trompenaars' "model" of national culture differences", in: ''International Journal of Intercultural Relations'' 20(2): p. 189-198.&lt;/ref&gt; This involved a large-scale survey of 8,841 managers and organization employees from 43 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Peter B.|last2=Dugan|first2=Shaun|last3=Trompenaars|first3=Fons|title=National culture and the values of organizational employees: A dimensional analysis across 43 nations|url=http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/27/2/231.short|website=Sage Journals|publisher=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model of national culture differences has seven dimensions. There are five orientations covering the ways in which human beings deal with each other, one which deals with time, and one which deals with the environment.

*'''Universalism vs. Particularism'''
Universalism is the belief that ideas and practices can be applied everywhere without modification, while particularism is the belief that circumstances dictate how ideas and practices should be applied. It asks the question, ''What is more important, rules or relationships?'' Cultures with high universalism see one reality and focus on formal rules. Business meetings are characterized by rational, professional arguments with a "get down to business" attitude. Trompenaars research found there was high universalism in countries like the United States, Canada, UK, Australia, Germany, and Sweden. Cultures with high particularism see reality as more subjective and place a greater emphasis on relationships.  It is important to get to know the people one is doing business with during meetings in a particularist environment.  Someone from a universalist culture would be wise not to dismiss personal meanderings as irrelevancies or mere small talk during such business meetings.  Countries that have high particularism include Venezuela, Indonesia, China, South Korea, and the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management : culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|pages=123–125|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Individualism vs. Communitarianism'''  
Individualism refers to people regarding themselves as individuals, while communitarianism refers to people regarding themselves as part of a group. Trompenaars research yielded some interesting results and suggested that cultures may change more quickly that many people realize. It may not be surprising to see a country like the United States with high individualism, but Mexico and the former communist countries of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union were also found to be individualistic in Trompenaars research. In Mexico, the shift from a previously communitarian culture could be explained with its membership in NAFTA and involvement in the global economy. This contrasts with [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|Hofstede's]] earlier research, which found these countries to be collectivist, and shows the dynamic and complex nature of culture.  Countries with high communitarianism include Germany, China, France, Japan, and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management : culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|pages=125–126|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Neutral vs. Emotional''' 
A neutral culture is a culture in which emotions are held in check whereas an emotional culture is a culture in which emotions are expressed openly and naturally.  Neutral cultures that come rapidly to mind are those of the Japanese and British.  Some examples of high emotional cultures are the Netherlands, Mexico, Italy, Israel and Spain. In emotional cultures, people often smile, talk loudly when excited, and greet each other with enthusiasm. So, when people from neutral culture are doing business in an emotional culture they should be ready for a potentially animated and boisterous meeting and should try to respond warmly.  As for those from an emotional culture doing business in a neutral culture, they should not be put off by a lack of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management: Culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|page=126|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Specific vs. Diffuse'''
A specific culture is one in which individuals have a large public space they readily share with others and small private space guard closely and share with only close friends and associates. A diffuse culture is one in which public space and private space are similar in size and individuals guard their public space carefully, because entry into public space affords entry into private space as well. It looks at how separate a culture keeps their personal and public lives. [[Fred Luthans]] and Jonathan Doh give the following example which explains this:

''An example of these specific and diffuse cultural dimensions is provided by the United States and Germany. A U.S. professor, such as Robert Smith, PhD, generally would be called “Doctor Smith” by students when at his U.S. university. When shopping, however, he might be referred to by the store clerk as “Bob,” and he might even ask the clerk’s advice regarding some of his intended purchases. When golfing, Bob might just be one of the guys, even to a golf partner who happens to be a graduate student in his department. The reason for these changes in status is that, with the specific U.S. cultural values, people have large public spaces and often conduct themselves differently depending on their public role. At the same time, however, Bob has private space that is off-limits to the students who must call him “Doctor Smith” in class. In high-diffuse cultures, on the other hand, a person’s public life and private life often are similar. Therefore, in Germany, Herr Professor Doktor Schmidt would be referred to that way at the university, local market, and bowling alley—and even his wife might address him formally in public. A great deal of formality is maintained, often giving the impression that Germans are stuffy or aloof.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management: culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=/new York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|pages=126–127|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2014/05/one-reason-cross-cultural-small-talk-is-so-tricky|title=One Reason Cross-Cultural Small Talk Is So Tricky}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://x-culture.org/peach-vs-coconut-cultures/|title=PEACH VS. COCONUT CULTURES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Achievement vs. Ascription''' 
In an achievement culture, people are accorded status based on how well they perform their functions. In an ascription culture, status is based on who or what a person is. Does one have to prove himself to receive status or is it given to him? Achievement cultures include the US, Austria, Israel, Switzerland and the UK. Some ascription cultures are Venezuela, Indonesia, and China. When people from an achievement culture do business in an ascription culture it is important to have older, senior members with formal titles and respect should be shown to their counterparts. However, for an ascription culture doing business in an achievement culture, it is important to bring knowledgeable members who can prove to be proficient to other group, and respect should be shown for the knowledge and information of their counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management: culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|page=127|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
* '''Sequential vs. Synchronic'''
A sequential time culture is the one in which the people like events to happen in a chronological order. The punctuality is very appreciated and they base their lives in schedules, plannification and specific and clear deadlines; in this kind of cultures time is very important and they do not tolerate the waste of time. Instead in synchronic cultures, they see specific time periods as interwoven periods, the use to highlight the importance of punctuality and deadlines if these are key to meeting objectives and they often work in several things at a time, they are also more flexible with the distribution of time and commitments. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekof.bg.ac.rs/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/convergence-divergence.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Internal vs. External control''' 
Do we control our environment or are we controlled by it?

The concepts behind it are about organizing the way a device, computer program, or other (often technical) process works such that an entity or each of its sub-entities is always in exactly one of a number of possible states and where there are well-defined conditional transitions between these states.

The term "UML state machine" can refer to two kinds of state machines: ''behavioral state machines'' and ''protocol state machines''. Behavioral state machines can be used to model the behavior of individual entities (e.g., class instances). Protocol state machines are used to express usage protocols and can be used to specify the legal usage scenarios of classifiers, interfaces, and ports.
== Basic state machine concepts ==
Many software systems are [[event-driven programming|event-driven]], which means that they continuously wait for the occurrence of some external or internal '''[[#Events|event]]''' such as a mouse click, a button press, a time tick, or an arrival of a data packet. After recognizing the event, such systems react by performing the appropriate computation that may include manipulating the hardware or generating “soft” events that trigger other internal software components. (That’s why event-driven systems are alternatively called '''reactive systems'''.) Once the event handling is complete, the system goes back to waiting for the next event.

The response to an event generally depends on both the type of the event and on the internal '''[[#States|state]]''' of the system and can include a change of state leading to a '''[[#Actions and transitions|state transition]]'''. The pattern of events, states, and state transitions among those states can be abstracted and represented as a '''[[finite-state machine]]''' (FSM).

The concept of a FSM is important in [[event-driven programming]] because it makes the event handling explicitly dependent on both the event-type and on the state of the system. When used correctly, a state machine can drastically cut down the number of execution paths through the code, simplify the conditions tested at each branching point, and simplify the switching between different modes of execution.&lt;ref name=Samek08&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, using event-driven programming without an underlying FSM model can lead programmers to produce error prone, difficult to extend and excessively complex application code.&lt;ref name=Samek03b /&gt;

=== Basic UML state diagrams ===
UML preserves the general form of the [[state diagram|traditional state diagrams]]. The UML state diagrams are [[State diagram#Directed graph|directed graphs]] in which nodes denote states and connectors denote state transitions. For example, Figure 1 shows a UML state diagram corresponding to the computer keyboard state machine. In UML, states are represented as rounded rectangles labeled with state names. The transitions, represented as arrows, are labeled with the triggering events followed optionally by the list of executed actions. The '''initial transition''' originates from the solid circle and specifies the default state when the system first begins. Every state diagram should have such a transition, which should not be labeled, since it is not triggered by an event. The initial transition can have associated actions.

[[Image:UML state machine Fig1.png|thumb|upright=3|center|Figure 1: UML state diagram representing the computer keyboard state machine]]

=== Events ===
An '''event''' is something that happens that affects the system. Strictly speaking, in the UML specification,&lt;ref name=UML2_2 /&gt; the term event refers to the type of occurrence rather than to any concrete instance of that occurrence. For example, Keystroke is an event for the keyboard, but each press of a key is not an event but a concrete instance of the Keystroke event. Another event of interest for the keyboard might be Power-on, but turning the power on tomorrow at 10:05:36 will be just an instance of the Power-on event.

An event can have associated '''parameters''', allowing the event instance to convey not only the occurrence of some interesting incident but also quantitative information regarding that occurrence. For example, the Keystroke event generated by pressing a key on a computer keyboard has associated parameters that convey the character scan code as well as the status of the Shift, Ctrl, and Alt keys.

An event instance outlives the instantaneous occurrence that generated it and might convey this occurrence to one or more state machines. Once generated, the event instance goes through a processing life cycle that can consist of up to three stages. First, the event instance is '''received''' when it is accepted and waiting for processing (e.g., it is placed on the [[Message queue|event queue]]). Later, the event instance is '''dispatched''' to the state machine, at which point it becomes the current event. Finally, it is '''consumed''' when the state machine finishes processing the event instance. A consumed event instance is no longer available for processing.

=== States ===
Each state machine has a '''state''', which governs reaction of the state machine to events. For example, when you strike a key on a keyboard, the character code generated will be either an uppercase or a lowercase character, depending on whether the Caps Lock is active. Therefore, the keyboard's behavior can be divided into two states: the "default" state and the "caps_locked" state. (Most keyboards include an LED that indicates that the keyboard is in the "caps_locked" state.) The behavior of a keyboard depends only on certain aspects of its history, namely whether the Caps Lock key has been pressed, but not, for example, on how many and exactly which other keys have been pressed previously. A state can abstract away all possible (but irrelevant) event sequences and capture only the relevant ones.

In the context of software state machines (and especially classical FSMs), the term ''state'' is often understood as a single ''state variable'' that can assume only a limited number of a priori determined values (e.g., two values in case of the keyboard, or more generally - some kind of variable with an ''enum'' type in many programming languages). The idea of ''state variable'' (and classical FSM model) is that the value of the ''state variable'' fully defines the current state of the system at any given time. The concept of the state reduces the problem of identifying the execution context in the code to testing just the state variable instead of many variables, thus eliminating a lot of conditional logic.

=== Extended states ===
In practice, however, interpreting the whole state of the state machine as a single ''state variable'' quickly becomes impractical for all state machines beyond very simple ones. Indeed, even if we have a single 32-bit integer in our machine state, it could contribute to over 4 billion different states - and will lead to a premature ''state explosion''. This interpretation is not practical, so in UML state machines the whole ''state'' of the state machine is commonly split into (a) enumeratable ''state variable'' and (b) all the other variables which are named ''extended state''. Another way to see it is to interpret enumeratable ''state variable'' as a qualitative aspect and ''extended state'' as  quantitative aspects of the whole state. In this interpretation, a change of variable does not always imply a change of the qualitative aspects of the system behavior and therefore does not lead to a change of state.&lt;ref name=ROOM94&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

State machines supplemented with ''extended state'' variables are called '''extended state machines''' and UML state machines belong to this category. Extended state machines can apply the underlying formalism to much more complex problems than is practical without including extended state variables. For example, if we have to implement some kind of limit in our FSM (say, limiting number of keystrokes on keyboard to 1000), without ''extended state'' we'd need to create and process 1000 states - which is not practical; however, with an extended state machine we can introduce a &lt;code&gt;key_count&lt;/code&gt; variable, which is initialized to 1000 and decremented by every keystroke without changing ''state variable''. 

[[Image:UML state machine Fig2.png|thumb|upright=3|center|Figure 2: Extended state machine of "cheap keyboard" with extended state variable key_count and various guard conditions]]

The state diagram from Figure 2 is an example of an extended state machine, in which the complete condition of the system (called the ''extended state'') is the combination of a qualitative aspect—the ''state variable''—and the quantitative aspects—the ''extended state'' variables.

The obvious advantage of extended state machines is flexibility. For example, changing the limit governed by &lt;code&gt;key_count&lt;/code&gt; from 1000 to 10000 keystrokes, would not complicate the extended state machine at all. The only modification required would be changing the initialization value of the &lt;code&gt;key_count&lt;/code&gt; extended state variable during initialization.

This flexibility of extended state machines comes with a price, however, because of the complex coupling between the "qualitative" and the "quantitative" aspects of the extended state. The coupling occurs through the guard conditions attached to transitions, as shown in Figure 2.

=== Guard conditions ===
'''Guard conditions''' (or simply guards) are [[Boolean function|Boolean expressions]] evaluated dynamically based on the value of [[#Extended states|extended state variables]] and [[#Events|event parameters]]. Guard conditions affect the behavior of a state machine by enabling actions or transitions only when they evaluate to TRUE and disabling them when they evaluate to FALSE. In the UML notation, guard conditions are shown in square brackets (e.g., &lt;code&gt;[key_count == 0]&lt;/code&gt; in Figure 2).

The need for guards is the immediate consequence of adding memory [[#Extended states|extended state variables]] to the state machine formalism. Used sparingly, extended state variables and guards make up a powerful mechanism that can simplify designs. On the other hand, it is possible to abuse extended states and guards quite easily. &lt;ref name=Samek03d&gt;{{Cite web

=== Actions and transitions ===
When an [[#Events|event instance]] is dispatched, the state machine responds by performing '''actions''', such as changing a variable, performing I/O, invoking a function, generating another event instance, or changing to another state. Any parameter values associated with the current event are available to all actions directly caused by that event.

Switching from one state to another is called '''state transition''', and the event that causes it is called the triggering event, or simply the '''trigger'''. In the keyboard example, if the keyboard is in the "default" state when the CapsLock key is pressed, the keyboard will enter the "caps_locked" state. However, if the keyboard is already in the "caps_locked" state, pressing CapsLock will cause a different transition—from the "caps_locked" to the "default" state. In both cases, pressing CapsLock is the triggering event.

In [[#Extended states|extended state machines]], a transition can have a [[#Guard conditions|guard]], which means that the transition can "fire" only if the guard evaluates to TRUE. A state can have many transitions in response to the same trigger, as long as they have nonoverlapping guards; however, this situation could create problems in the sequence of evaluation of the guards when the common trigger occurs. The UML specification&lt;ref name=UML2_2/&gt; intentionally does not stipulate any particular order; rather, UML puts the burden on the designer to devise guards in such a way that the order of their evaluation does not matter. Practically, this means that guard expressions should have no side effects, at least none that would alter evaluation of other guards having the same trigger.

=== Run-to-completion execution model ===
All state machine formalisms, including UML state machines, universally assume that a state machine completes processing of each event before it can start processing the next event. This model of execution is called ''[[run to completion]]'', or RTC.

In the RTC model, the system processes events in discrete, indivisible RTC steps. New incoming events cannot interrupt the processing of the current event and must be stored (typically in an [[Message queue|event queue]]) until the state machine becomes idle again. These semantics completely avoid any internal concurrency issues within a single state machine. The RTC model also gets around the conceptual problem of processing actions associated with transitions, where the state machine is not in a well-defined state (is between two states) for the duration of the action. During event processing, the system is unresponsive (unobservable), so the ill-defined state during that time has no practical significance.

Note, however, that RTC does not mean that a state machine has to monopolize the CPU until the RTC step is complete.&lt;ref name=UML2_2/&gt; The [[Preemption (computing)|preemption]] restriction only applies to the task context of the state machine that is already busy processing events. In a [[Computer multitasking|multitasking environment]], other tasks (not related to the task context of the busy state machine) can be running, possibly preempting the currently executing state machine. As long as other state machines do not share variables or other resources with each other, there are no [[Thread (computer science)#Concurrency and data structures|concurrency hazards]].

The key advantage of RTC processing is simplicity. Its biggest disadvantage is that the responsiveness of a state machine is determined by its longest RTC step. Achieving short RTC steps can often significantly complicate real-time designs.

== UML extensions to the traditional FSM formalism ==
Though the [[finite state machine|traditional FSMs]] are an excellent tool for tackling smaller problems, it's also generally known that they tend to become unmanageable, even for moderately involved systems. Due to the phenomenon known as '''state and transition explosion''', the complexity of a traditional FSM tends to grow much faster than the complexity of the system it describes. This happens because the traditional state machine formalism inflicts repetitions. For example, if you try to represent the behavior of a simple pocket calculator with a traditional FSM, you'll immediately notice that many events (e.g., the Clear or Off button presses) are handled identically in many states. A conventional FSM shown in the figure below, has no means of capturing such a commonality and requires ''repeating'' the same actions and transitions in many states. What's missing in the traditional state machines is the mechanism for factoring out the common behavior in order to share it across many states.

[[Image:UML state machine Fig2a.png|thumb|upright=3|center|A pocket calculator (left) and the traditional state machine with multiple transitions Clear and Off (right)]]

UML state machines address exactly this shortcoming of the conventional FSMs. They provide a number of features for eliminating the repetitions so that the complexity of a UML state machine no longer explodes but tends to faithfully represent the complexity of the reactive system it describes. Obviously, these features are very interesting to software developers, because only they make the whole state machine approach truly applicable to real-life problems.

=== Hierarchically nested states ===
The most important innovation of UML state machines over the [[finite state machine|traditional FSMs]] is the introduction of '''hierarchically nested states''' (that is why statecharts are also called '''hierarchical state machines''', or '''HSM'''s). The semantics associated with state nesting are as follows (see Figure 3): If a system is in the nested state, for example "result" (called the '''substate'''), it also (implicitly) is in the surrounding state "on" (called the '''superstate'''). This state machine will attempt to handle any event in the context of the substate, which conceptually is at the lower level of the hierarchy. However, if the substate "result" does not prescribe how to handle the event, the event is not quietly discarded as in a traditional "flat" state machine; rather, it is automatically handled at the higher level context of the superstate "on". This is what is meant by the system being in state "result" as well as "on". Of course, state nesting is not limited to one level only, and the simple rule of event processing applies recursively to any level of nesting.

[[Image:UML state machine Fig2b.png|thumb|upright=3|center|Figure 3: A pocket calculator (left) and the UML state machine with state nesting (right)]]

States that contain other states are called ''composite states''; conversely, states without internal structure are called ''simple states''. A nested state is called a ''direct substate'' when it is not contained by any other state; otherwise, it is referred to as a ''transitively nested substate''.

Because the internal structure of a composite state can be arbitrarily complex, any hierarchical state machine can be viewed as an internal structure of some (higher-level) composite state. It is conceptually convenient to define one composite state as the ultimate root of state machine hierarchy. In the UML specification,&lt;ref name=UML2_2/&gt; every state machine has a '''top state''' (the abstract root of every state machine hierarchy), which contains all the other elements of the entire state machine. The graphical rendering of this all-enclosing top state is optional.

As you can see, the semantics of hierarchical state decomposition are designed to facilitate reusing of behavior. The substates (nested states) need only define the differences from the superstates (containing states). A substate can easily inherit&lt;ref name=Samek03b&gt;{{Cite web

 |date=April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the common behavior from its superstate(s) by simply ignoring commonly handled events, which are then automatically handled by higher-level states. In other words, hierarchical state nesting enables '''[[programming by difference]]'''.&lt;ref name=Samek03c&gt;{{Cite web

The aspect of state hierarchy emphasized most often is [[abstraction]]—an old and powerful technique for coping with complexity. Instead of addressing all aspects of a complex system at the same time, it is often possible to ignore (abstract away) some parts of the system. Hierarchical states are an ideal mechanism for hiding internal details because the designer can easily zoom out or zoom in to hide or show nested states.

However, composite states don't simply hide complexity; they also actively reduce it through the powerful mechanism of hierarchical event processing. Without such reuse, even a moderate increase in system complexity could lead to an explosive increase in the number of states and transitions. For example, the hierarchical state machine representing the pocket calculator (Figure 3) avoids repeating the transitions Clear and Off in virtually every state. Avoiding repetition allows the growth of HSMs to remain proportionate to growth in system complexity. As the modeled system grows, the opportunity for reuse also increases and thus potentially counteracts the disproportionate increase in numbers of states and transitions typical of traditional FSMs.

=== Orthogonal regions ===
Analysis by hierarchical state decomposition can include the application of the operation 'exclusive-OR' to any given state. For example, if a system is in the "on" superstate (Figure 3), it may be the case that it is also in either "operand1" substate OR the "operand2" substate OR the "opEntered" substate OR the "result" substate. This would lead to description of the "on" superstate as an 'OR-state'.

UML statecharts also introduce the complementary AND-decomposition. Such decomposition means that a composite state can contain two or more orthogonal regions (orthogonal means compatible and independent in this context) and that being in such a composite state entails being in all its orthogonal regions simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Harel98&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthogonal regions address the frequent problem of a combinatorial increase in the number of states when the behavior of a system is fragmented into independent, concurrently active parts. For example, apart from the main keypad, a computer keyboard has an independent numeric keypad. From the previous discussion, recall the two states of the main keypad already identified: "default" and "caps_locked" (see Figure 1). The numeric keypad also can be in two states—"numbers" and "arrows"—depending on whether Num Lock is active. The complete state space of the keyboard in the standard decomposition is therefore the [[Cartesian product]] of the two components (main keypad and numeric keypad) and consists of four states: "default–numbers," "default–arrows," "caps_locked–numbers," and "caps_locked–arrows." However, this would be an  unnatural representation because the behavior of the numeric keypad does not depend on the state of the main keypad and vice versa. The use of orthogonal regions allows the mixing of independent behaviors as a Cartesian product to be avoided and, instead, for them to remain separate, as shown in Figure 4.

[[Image:UML state machine Fig4.png|thumb|upright=3|center|Figure 4: Two orthogonal regions (main keypad and numeric keypad) of a computer keyboard]]

Note that if the orthogonal regions are fully independent of each other, their combined complexity is simply additive, which means that the number of independent states needed to model the system is simply the sum ''k + l + m + ...'', where ''k, l, m, ...'' denote numbers of OR-states in each orthogonal region. However, the general case of mutual dependency, on the other hand, results in multiplicative complexity, so in general, the number of states needed is the product ''k × l × m × ...''.

In most real-life situations, orthogonal regions would be only approximately orthogonal (i.e. not truly independent). Therefore, UML statecharts provide a number of ways for orthogonal regions to communicate and synchronize their behaviors. Among these rich sets of (sometimes complex) mechanisms, perhaps the most important feature is that orthogonal regions can coordinate their behaviors by sending event instances to each other.

Even though orthogonal regions imply independence of execution (allowing more or less concurrency), the UML specification does not require that a separate thread of execution be assigned to each orthogonal region (although this can be done if desired). In fact, most commonly, orthogonal regions execute within the same thread.&lt;ref name=Douglass99&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The UML specification requires only that the designer does not rely on any particular order for event instances to be dispatched to the relevant orthogonal regions.

=== Entry and exit actions ===
Every state in a UML statechart can have optional '''entry actions''', which are executed upon entry to a state, as well as optional '''exit actions''', which are executed upon exit from a state. Entry and exit actions are associated with states, not transitions. Regardless of how a state is entered or exited, all its entry and exit actions will be executed. Because of this characteristic, statecharts behave like [[Moore machine]]s. The UML notation for state entry and exit actions is to place the reserved word "entry" (or "exit") in the state right below the name compartment, followed by the forward slash and the list of arbitrary actions (see Figure 5).

[[Image:UML state machine Fig5.png|thumb|upright=3|center|Figure 5: Toaster oven state machine with entry and exit actions]]

The value of entry and exit actions is that they provide means for ''guaranteed initialization and cleanup'', very much like class constructors and destructors in [[Object-oriented programming]]. For example, consider the "door_open" state from Figure 5, which corresponds to the toaster oven behavior while the door is open. This state has a very important safety-critical requirement: Always disable the heater when the door is open. Additionally, while the door is open, the internal lamp illuminating the oven should light up.

Of course, such behavior could be modeled by adding appropriate actions (disabling the heater and turning on the light) to every transition path leading to the "door_open" state (the user may open the door at any time during "baking" or "toasting" or when the oven is not used at all). It should not be forgotten to extinguish the internal lamp with every transition leaving the "door_open" state. However, such a solution would cause the [[Don't repeat yourself|repetition]] of actions in many transitions. More importantly, such an approach leaves the design error-prone during subsequent amendments to behavior (e.g., the next programmer working on a new feature, such as top-browning, might simply forget to disable the heater on transition to "door_open").

Entry and exit actions allow implementation of desired behavior in a safer, simpler, and more intuitive way. As shown in Figure 5, it could be specified that the exit action from "heating" disables the heater, the entry action to "door_open" lights up the oven lamp, and the exit action from "door_open" extinguishes the lamp. The use of entry and exit actions is preferable to placing an action on a transition because it avoids repetitive coding and improves function by eliminating a safety hazard; (heater on while door open). The semantics of exit actions guarantees that, regardless of the transition path, the heater will be disabled when the toaster is not in the "heating" state.

Because entry actions are executed automatically whenever an associated state is entered, they often determine the conditions of operation or the identity of the state, very much as a class constructor determines the identity of the object being constructed. For example, the identity of the "heating" state is determined by the fact that the heater is turned on. This condition must be established before entering any substate of "heating" because entry actions to a substate of "heating," like "toasting," rely on proper initialization of the "heating" superstate and perform only the differences from this initialization. Consequently, the order of execution of entry actions must always proceed from the outermost state to the innermost state (top-down).

Not surprisingly, this order is analogous to the order in which class constructors are invoked. Construction of a class always starts at the very root of the class hierarchy and follows through all inheritance levels down to the class being instantiated. The execution of exit actions, which corresponds to destructor invocation, proceeds in the exact reverse order (bottom-up).

=== Internal transitions ===
Very commonly, an event causes only some internal actions to execute but does not lead to a change of state (state transition). In this case, all actions executed comprise the '''internal transition'''. For example, when one types on a keyboard, it responds by generating different character codes. However, unless the Caps Lock key is pressed, the state of the keyboard does not change (no state transition occurs). In UML, this situation should be modeled with internal transitions, as shown in Figure 6. The UML notation for internal transitions follows the general syntax used for exit (or entry) actions, except instead of the word entry (or exit) the internal transition is labeled with the triggering event (e.g., see the internal transition triggered by the ANY_KEY event in Figure 6).

[[Image:UML state machine Fig6.png|thumb|upright=3|center|Figure 6: UML state diagram of the keyboard state machine with internal transitions]]

In the absence of entry and exit actions, internal transitions would be identical to '''self-transitions''' (transitions in which the target state is the same as the source state). In fact, in a classical [[Mealy machine]], actions are associated exclusively with state transitions, so the only way to execute actions without changing state is through a self-transition (depicted as a directed loop in Figure 1 from the top of this article). However, in the presence of entry and exit actions, as in UML statecharts, a self-transition involves the execution of exit and entry actions and therefore it is distinctively different from an internal transition.

In contrast to a self-transition, no entry or exit actions are ever executed as a result of an internal transition, even if the internal transition is inherited from a higher level of the hierarchy than the currently active state. Internal transitions inherited from superstates at any level of nesting act as if they were defined directly in the currently active state.

=== Transition execution sequence ===
State nesting combined with entry and exit actions significantly complicates the state transition semantics in HSMs compared to the traditional FSMs. When dealing with [[#Hierarchically nested states|hierarchically nested states]] and [[#Orthogonal regions|orthogonal regions]], the simple term ''current state'' can be quite confusing. In an HSM, more than one state can be active at once. If the state machine is in a leaf state that is contained in a composite state (which is possibly contained in a higher-level composite state, and so on), all the composite states that either directly or transitively contain the leaf state are also active. Furthermore, because some of the composite states in this hierarchy might have orthogonal regions, the current active state is actually represented by a tree of states starting with the single top state at the root down to individual simple states at the leaves. The UML specification refers to such a state tree as state configuration.&lt;ref name=UML2_2/&gt;

[[Image:UML state machine Fig7.png|thumb|upright=3|center|Figure 7: State roles in a state transition]]

In UML, a state transition can directly connect any two states. These two states, which may be composite, are designated as the '''main source''' and the '''main target''' of a transition. Figure 7 shows a simple transition example and explains the state roles in that transition. The UML specification prescribes that taking a state transition involves executing the following actions in the following sequence (see Section 15.3.14 in ''OMG Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML), Infrastructure Version 2.2''&lt;ref name=UML2_2/&gt;):
# Evaluate the guard condition associated with the transition and perform the following steps only if the guard evaluates to TRUE.
# Exit the source state configuration.
# Execute the actions associated with the transition.
# Enter the target state configuration.

The transition sequence is easy to interpret in the simple case of both the main source and the main target nesting at the same level. For example, transition T1 shown in Figure 7 causes the evaluation of the guard g(); followed by the sequence of actions: &lt;code&gt;a(); b(); t(); c(); d();&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;e()&lt;/code&gt;; assuming that the guard &lt;code&gt;g()&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to TRUE.

However, in the general case of source and target states nested at different levels of the state hierarchy, it might not be immediately obvious how many levels of nesting need to be exited. The UML specification&lt;ref name=UML2_2/&gt; prescribes that a transition involves exiting all nested states from the current active state (which might be a direct or transitive substate of the main source state) up to, but not including, the '''least common ancestor''' (LCA) state of the main source and main target states. As the name indicates, the LCA is the lowest composite state that is simultaneously a superstate (ancestor) of both the source and the target states. As described before, the order of execution of exit actions is always from the most deeply nested state (the current active state) up the hierarchy to the LCA but without exiting the LCA. For instance, the LCA(s1,s2) of states "s1" and "s2" shown in Figure 7 is state "s."

Entering the target state configuration commences from the level where the exit actions left off (i.e., from inside the LCA). As described before, entry actions must be executed starting from the highest-level state down the state hierarchy to the main target state. If the main target state is composite, the UML semantics prescribes to "drill" into its submachine recursively using the local initial transitions. The target state configuration is completely entered only after encountering a leaf state that has no initial transitions.

=== Local versus external transitions ===
Before UML 2,&lt;ref name=UML2_2/&gt; the only transition semantics in use was the '''external transition''', in which the main source of the transition is always exited and the main target of the transition is always entered. UML 2 preserved the "external transition" semantics for backward compatibility, but introduced also a new kind of transition called '''local transition''' (see Section 15.3.15 in ''Unified Modeling Language (UML), Infrastructure Version 2.2''&lt;ref name=UML2_2/&gt;). For many transition topologies, external and local transitions are actually identical. However, a local transition doesn’t cause exit from and reentry to the main source state if the main target state is a substate of the main source. In addition, a local state transition doesn’t cause exit from and reentry to the main target state if the main target is a superstate of the main source state.

[[Image:UML state machine Fig8.png|thumb|upright=3|center|Figure 8: Local (a) versus external transitions (b).]]

Figure 8 contrasts local (a) and external (b) transitions. In the top row, you see the case of the main source containing the main target. The local transition does not cause exit from the source, while the external transition causes exit and reentry to the source. In the bottom row of Figure 8, you see the case of the main target containing the main source. The local transition does not cause entry to the target, whereas the external transition causes exit and reentry to the target.

=== Event deferral ===
Sometimes an event arrives at a particularly inconvenient time, when a state machine is in a state that cannot handle the event. In many cases, the nature of the event is such that it can be postponed (within limits) until the system enters another state, in which it is better prepared to handle the original event.

UML state machines provide a special mechanism for '''deferring events''' in states. In every state, you can include a clause &lt;code&gt;[event list]/defer&lt;/code&gt;. If an event in the current state’s deferred event list occurs, the event will be saved (deferred) for future processing until a state is entered that does not list the event in its deferred event list. Upon entry to such a state, the UML state machine will automatically recall any saved event(s) that are no longer deferred and will then either consume or discard these events. It is possible for a superstate to have a transition defined on an event that is deferred by a substate. Consistent with other areas in the specification of UML state machines, the substate takes precedence over the superstate, the event will be deferred and the transition for the superstate will not be executed. In the case of orthogonal regions where one orthogonal region defers an event and another consumes the event, the consumer takes precedence and the event is consumed and not deferred.

== The limitations of UML state machines ==
Harel statecharts, which are the precursors of UML state machines, have been invented as "a visual formalism for complex systems",&lt;ref name=Harel87/&gt; so from their inception, they have been inseparably associated with graphical representation in the form of state diagrams. However, it is important to understand that the concept of UML state machine transcends any particular notation, graphical or textual. The UML specification&lt;ref name=UML2_2/&gt; makes this distinction apparent by clearly separating state machine semantics from the notation.

However, the notation of UML statecharts is not purely visual. Any nontrivial state machine requires a large amount of textual information (e.g., the specification of actions and guards). The exact syntax of action and guard expressions isn’t defined in the UML specification, so many people use either structured English or, more formally, expressions in an implementation language such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], or [[Java (programming language)|Java]].&lt;ref name=Douglass99b&gt;{{Cite web
 | title  = UML Statecharts
 | author = Douglass, Bruce Powel
 | url    = https://www.embedded.com/design/uml/4219602/UML-Statecharts
 | publisher = Embedded Systems Programming
 |date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, this means that UML statechart notation depends heavily on the specific [[programming language]].

Nevertheless, most of the statecharts semantics are heavily biased toward graphical notation. For example, state diagrams poorly represent the sequence of processing, be it order of evaluation of [[#Guard conditions|guards]] or order of dispatching events to [[#Orthogonal regions|orthogonal regions]]. The UML specification sidesteps these problems by putting the burden on the designer not to rely on any particular sequencing. However, it is the case that when UML state machines are actually implemented, there is inevitably full control over order of execution, giving rise to criticism that the UML semantics may be unnecessarily restrictive. Similarly, statechart diagrams require a lot of plumbing gear (pseudostates, like joins, forks, junctions, choicepoints, etc.) to represent the flow of control graphically. In other words, these elements of the graphical notation do not add much value in representing flow of control as compared to plain [[Structured programming|structured code]].

The UML notation and semantics are really geared toward computerized [[UML tools]]. A UML state machine, as represented in a tool, is not just the state diagram, but rather a mixture of graphical and textual representation that precisely captures both the state topology and the actions. The users of the tool can get several complementary views of the same state machine, both visual and textual, whereas the generated code is just one of the many available views.

'''Wallops Flight Facility''' ('''WFF''') {{Airport codes|WAL|KWAL|WAL}}, located on the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Eastern Shore]] of [[Virginia]], [[United States]], approximately {{convert|100|mi|km}} north-northeast of [[Norfolk, VA|Norfolk]], is operated by the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]], primarily as a [[rocket launch site]] to support science and exploration missions for [[NASA]] and other Federal agencies. WFF includes an extensively instrumented range to support launches of more than a dozen types of [[sounding rocket]]s; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code810/vehicles.html |title=Sounding Rocket Vehicles |publisher=Nasa Wallops Flight Facility |accessdate=22 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; small expendable suborbital and orbital rockets; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/mpl/elvs.html |title=Expendable Launch Vehicles |publisher=Nasa Wallops Flight Facility |accessdate=22 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[high-altitude balloon]] flights carrying scientific instruments for atmospheric and astronomical research; and, using its Research Airport, [[flight test]]s of aeronautical research aircraft, including [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s.

There have been over 16,000 launches from the rocket testing range at Wallops since its founding in 1945 in the quest for information on the flight characteristics of airplanes, launch vehicles, and spacecraft, and to increase the knowledge of the Earth's upper atmosphere and the environment of [[outer space]]. The launch vehicles vary in size and power from the small [[Super Loki]] meteorological rockets to orbital-class vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code840/news/Wallops_Range_Fact_Sheet.pdf |title=NFIRE |publisher=Nasa Wallops Flight Facility |accessdate=22 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219225204/http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code840/news/Wallops_Range_Fact_Sheet.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marsspaceport.com/mid-atlantic-spaceport-mission |title=Overview |publisher=Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport |accessdate=22 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213040/http://www.marsspaceport.com/mid-atlantic-spaceport-mission |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slideshare.net/astrosociety/aas-goddard-201103301230wrobel |title=Activities at Wallops Flight Facility |publisher=American Astronautical Society |accessdate=22 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wallops Flight Facility also supports science missions for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and occasionally for foreign governments and commercial organizations. Wallops also supports development tests and exercises involving [[United States Navy]] aircraft and ship-based electronics and weapon systems in the [[Virginia Capes]] operating area, near the entrance to the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. In addition to its fixed-location instrumentation assets, the WFF range includes mobile [[radar]], [[telemetry]] receivers, and command transmitters that can be transported by [[cargo plane]]s to locations around the world, in order to establish a temporary range where no other instrumentation exists, to ensure safety, and to collect data in order to enable and support suborbital rocket launches from remote sites.

The WFF mobile range assets have been used to support rocket launches from locations in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, [[South America]], Africa, Europe, [[Australia]], and at sea. Workers at Wallops include approximately 1,000 full-time  NASA [[civil service]] employees and the employees of contractors, about 30 [[U.S. Navy]] personnel, and about 100 employees of NOAA.

== History ==

In 1945, NASA's predecessor agency, the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), established a rocket launch site on [[Wallops Island]] under the direction of the [[Langley Research Center]]. This site was designated the '''Pilotless Aircraft Research Station''' and conducted high-speed aerodynamic research to supplement wind tunnel and laboratory investigations into the problems of flight. In 1958, Congress established NASA, which absorbed Langley Research Center and other NACA field centers and research facilities. At that time, the Pilotless Aircraft Research Station became a separate facility, '''Wallops Station''', operating directly under NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

In 1959, NASA acquired the former '''[[Naval Air Station Chincoteague]]''', and engineering and administrative activities were moved to this location. In 1974, the Wallops Station was named '''Wallops Flight Center'''. The name was changed to '''Wallops Flight Facility''' in 1981, when it became part of Goddard Space Flight Center.

In the early years, research at Wallops concentrated on obtaining aerodynamic data at transonic and low supersonic speeds. Between 1959 and 1961, Project Mercury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/history/mercury/mercury-overview.htm |title=Project Mercury Overview |publisher=Nasa Kennedy Space Centre |accessdate=22 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603211738/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/history/mercury/mercury-overview.htm |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; capsules were tested at Wallops in support of NASA's manned space flight program - the [[Mercury program]] - before astronauts were launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in Florida. Some of these tests using the [[Little Joe (rocket)|Little Joe]] [[booster rocket]] were designed to [[flight-qualify]] components of the spacecraft, including the escape and recovery systems and some of the life support systems. Two [[rhesus monkey]]s, Sam and Miss Sam, were sent aloft as pioneers for astronauts; both were recovered safely.

The first payload launched into orbit from Wallops Island was [[Explorer 9|Explorer IX]], atop a [[Scout rocket]], on February 15, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Myler, Joseph L. "7-Mile Salt Marsh, Sand Strip in Virginia Oldest, Tiniest Spaceport in U.S." (March 16, 1961), UPI via ''The Middlesboro Daily News", p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2013, the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer ([[LADEE]]) was launched from Wallops, atop a [[Minotaur V]] rocket. This was the first time that an American lunar mission had been launched from anywhere but [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.space.com/22673-nasa-ladee-moon-launch-webcast.html NASA Launch Shoots for the Moon from Virginia Tonight: Watch It Online]", Space.com, September 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallops Island is currently experiencing beach erosion of 10 to 22 feet (3 to 7 meters) a year, due in part to the [[current sea level rise]]; some access roads and parking lots have had to be rebuilt several times over the past five years. NASA has responded by continually fortifying the shoreline with sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/waters-edge-the-crisis-of-rising-sea-levels/ |title=As the seas rise, a slow-motion disaster gnaws at America’s shores |last1=McNeill |first1=Ryan |last2=Nelson |first2=Deborah J. |date=4 September 2014 |website=www.reuters.com |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permanent ground control station for NASA's [[RQ-4 Global Hawk]] drone is at Wallops Flight Facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/local/virginia/2016/06/24/navy-triton-drones-wallops/86332348/ 3 governors, 1 mission: Bring drones to Wallops] Retrieved June 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==

[[Image:08-WFF Airspace.jpg|thumb|upright]]

The WFF Main Base is located on the Eastern Shore of Virginia on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} west of [[Chincoteague, Virginia]]; about {{convert|90|mi|km}} north of [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and {{convert|40|mi|km}} southeast of [[Salisbury, Maryland]]. The WFF consists of three separate parcels of land totaling 6,200 [[acres]] (25&amp;nbsp;km²): the Main Base, the Mainland, and the Wallops Island Launch Site. The Mainland and the Wallops Island Launch Site are about {{convert|7|mi|km}} southeast of the Main Base.

=== Airspace ===

Wallops operates [[controlled airspace]] with [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) qualified [[air traffic controller]]s including:

* The WFF Airport Control Zone to {{convert|2500|ft|m}} within a {{convert|5|smi|km|adj=on}} radius of the airport
* Restricted Area R-6604 connecting WFF airspace and offshore warning areas.

=== Fixed facilities ===

Major Wallops facilities include FAA-certified [[runway]]s; an experimental UAV runway; and crash, fire and rescue services. WFF has facilities for the receipt, inspection, assembly, checkout and storage of [[rocket motor]]s and other hazardous [[pyrotechnic device]]s. The Wallops Island Launch Site includes six [[launch pad]]s, three [[blockhouse]]s for launch control, and assembly buildings to support the preparation and launching of suborbital and orbital launch vehicles.

[[Image:03-WFF Launch Range Map.png|thumb|left|The NASA Wallops Flight Facility Range]]

The Wallops Research Range includes ground-based and mobile systems, and a range control center. Its radar facilities and systems are used for tracking and surveillance. Telemetry facilities include a variety of antennas, receivers, and display instrumentation systems. Command uplink and optical tracking facilities are included as part of the range. The range also provides premier digital photographic and video services including operation of numerous still cameras, high speed and video systems for Range Safety support, surveillance, and post-launch analysis (e.g., failure analysis), project documentation (e.g., fabrication and test), administrative documentation, and archiving for environmental studies. In addition, WFF has a variety of communications systems and facilities to route voice, video, and data in support of launch processing, flight and test operations.

The WFF Research Airport is located on the Main Base. There are three runways (from {{convert|4810|ft|m}} to {{convert|8750|ft|m}} long), two [[taxiway]]s, three ramps, and one hazardous cargo loading area in active service. Two ramps adjoin the two active hangars, and a third ramp adjoins the Crash, Fire and Rescue building. The primary research runway has a test section with a variety of surface textures and materials for runway research projects.

Weather measurements and predictions are critical to all Research Airport operations, rocket and balloon launches, and in safely conducting hazardous operations on the ground. Wallops meteorological services provide measurements of upper atmospheric and magnetic phenomena to augment and enable collection of scientific data by sensors aboard flight vehicles.

It can detect a single raindrop of 3 millimeters at a range of 10 kilometers and cloud water content as little as 1&amp;nbsp;gram per cubic meter. SPANDAR’s sensitivity with its {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} dish antenna can detect small changes in the [[refractive index]] of air caused by sea breeze fronts, gust fronts, and various forms of [[clear air turbulence]].

=== Mobile systems ===

[[Image:16-WFF Launch Locations.jpg|thumb|right|The NASA Wallops Mobile Range instrumentation has been deployed to support launch events in dozens of locations around the world.]]

The Wallops mobile range instrumentation includes telemetry, radar, command and power systems. These assets are used as needed to supplement instrumentation at existing ranges, or to establish a temporary range to ensure safety and collect data to support the rocket customers in a remote location where no other range instrumentation exists. This complement of transportable systems can be deployed to provide complete range capabilities at remote locations around the world. While Wallops Island is the prime location for range services, major sounding rocket campaigns have been supported at [[Poker Flat]], [[Alaska]]; [[Andoya]], [[Norway]]; and [[Kwajalein]] Island, [[Marshall Islands]]. The Wallops Mobile Instrumentation is integrated with NASA and [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] networks and can be used to supplement established ranges in support of rocket launches.

== Range technology development ==

[[Image:18-WFF Future Range.jpg|thumb|right|Envisioned Future Range Architecture]]

Since 2001, engineers at NASA Wallops Flight Facility have been developing new range technologies, systems and approaches to improve the cost and responsiveness of launch and flight test activities, within the constraints of available funding and program schedules.

Specifically, NASA Wallops has been leading two range technology development projects: the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070712035930/http://artwg.ksc.nasa.gov/Media/10_AFSS_%26_LCTT.pdf Autonomous Flight Safety System (AFSS) and the Low Cost TDRSS Transceiver (LCT2)].

AFSS is a project to develop an autonomous on-board system that could augment or replace traditional ground-commanded Range Safety flight termination systems. The AFSS would use redundant sensors and processors on board a launch vehicle to monitor its trajectory, and if necessary initiate pyrotechnic devices to terminate the flight.

LCT2 is an effort to produce a relatively low-cost transceiver to allow launch vehicles to communicate through NASA's [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] (TDRSS) after they have gone over the horizon from the launch site. LCT2 is being pursued as part of the Space Based Range Demonstration and Certification (SBRDC) program (formerly called [https://web.archive.org/web/20070712035931/http://www.spacecongress.org/2004/1a-denson.pdf Space Based Telemetry and Range Safety (STARS)]) in cooperation with NASA [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html Kennedy Space Center].

The [[NASA Visitor Center (Wallops Flight Facility)|Wallops Visitor Center]] has a variety of hands-on exhibits and hosts weekly educational activities and programs to enable children to explore and learn about the technologies designed and used by NASA researchers and scientists. In addition, one Saturday each month, NASA invites [[model rocketry]] enthusiasts to launch their own rockets from the WFF rocket launch site. NASA personnel also participate, launching models of various rockets and explaining the [[spacecraft]] they carry in real life.

The schedule for sounding rocket launches from WFF is posted on its official Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wallops/home/ |title=NASA's Wallops Flight Facility |publisher=Nasa |accessdate=27 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
For many years WFF was home to the NSIP Sub-SEM and SEM projects. NSIP stands for the NASA Student Involvement Project, the Sub-SEM project was to design one of four experiments that would be inserted into an ORION-II one-stage rocket and launched above 98 percent of the atmosphere, and experience over 30 Gs of centrifugal force, while SEM was to design an experiment that would be flown on a future Space Shuttle mission. Each project gave 16 students and four teachers (four students and one teacher from each high school) the opportunity to spend an almost all-expense-paid week at WFF. Normally the students and teachers stayed in the Mariner Motel, now a Holiday Inn, conducting experiments and learning about the facility. Following the presidential mandate and budget cuts the entire NSIP program, SEM and Sub-SEM included, was shut down.

==Accidents==

On April 2, 1957, a [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-6 Neptune]] exploded in midair after takeoff from what was then known as [[NAAS Chincoteague]]. All eleven occupants of the aircraft died. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19570402-2|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 1995, the maiden flight of a [[Conestoga (rocket)|Conestoga 1620 rocket]] failed 46 seconds after liftoff, resulting in disintegration. [[Space Services Inc.|EER Space Systems]], Conestoga's manufacturer, concluded that low frequency noise from an unknown source upset the guidance system on the rocket causing it to order course corrections when none were needed. The rocket went off course when its first stage steering mechanism ran out of hydraulic fluid and became inoperable. After this failure, the Conestoga program was terminated, and EER abandoned the launch business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conestoga 1620|url=http://www.astronautix.com/c/conestoga1620.html|website=astronautix.com|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conestoga|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/conestoga.htm|website=globalsecurity.org|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the launch, the Conestoga was the largest rocket ever launched from Wallops Island, and it was the first orbital mission attempted from the facility since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roylance|first1=Frank|title=Rocket explodes above Wallops Malfunction ends first commercial flight from NASA center|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-10-24/news/1995297106_1_rocket-eer-spacecraft|website=baltimoresun.com|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport Launch Pad 0|launch pad]] at Wallops Island were the first commercially built facilities in the US. 14 scientific experiments, some of which were planned to return from orbit, were destroyed. All debris landed in the Atlantic Ocean. There were no injuries. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chrasekaran|first1=Rajiv|title=Rocket explodes off VA.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1995/10/24/rocket-explodes-off-va/2f8b50ba-6b00-4682-ad42-b1a126ee3cad/?utm_term=.2c93a158fee2|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 1998 a [[Learjet 45]] was destroyed at Wallops after a loss of control during a water ingestion test flight. Only minor injuries to a copilot and flight engineer were reported. There were no ground injuries. The airplane was being used to test a new nose wheel tire. For the test, the airplane was passed through a "pool" or "trough" of water on the runway at different speeds. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NTSB Identification: IAD99FA008|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/about/employment/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20001211X11269&amp;ntsbno=IAD99FA008&amp;akey=1|website=ntsb.gov|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot failed to obtain/maintain alignment with the water pool and lost control. The plane departed the left side of the runway, and struck a pickup truck parked adjacent to the runway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19981027-1|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2008, a [[ALV X-1]] [[sounding rocket]] was intentionally destroyed 20 seconds into flight after veering too far off course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tennant|first1=Diane|title=NASA destroys rocket shortly after launch at Wallops Island|url=https://pilotonline.com/business/article_5d649cf4-0f04-59e5-91be-e24d724f3a81.html|website=pilotonline.com|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On October 28, 2014, a failure occurred in an [[Antares (rocket)|Antares]] rocket, carrying [[Cygnus CRS Orb-3]], shortly after launch and destroyed both the rocket and the payload at the adjacent [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport]] on [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport Launch Pad 0|Launch Pad 0A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wall|first1=Mike|title=Private Orbital Sciences Rocket Explodes During Launch, NASA Cargo Lost|url=http://www.space.com/27576-private-orbital-sciences-rocket-explosion.html|website=space.com|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Register of Marine Species''' ('''WoRMS''') is a [[database]] that aims to provide an authoritative and comprehensive list of names of marine organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marinespecies.org/about.php |title=Towards a World Register of Marine Species |publisher=World Register of Marine Species |accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The content of the registry is edited and maintained by scientific specialists on each group of organism. These [[taxonomist]]s control the quality of the information, which is gathered from malacological journals and several regional and taxon-specific databases. WoRMS maintains valid names of all marine organisms, but also provides information on [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] and invalid names. It will be an ongoing task to maintain the registry, as new species are constantly being discovered and described by scientists. In addition, the nomenclature and taxonomy of existing species is often corrected or changed as new research is constantly being published.

==History==
WoRMS was founded in 2008 and grew out of the [[MarBEF Data System|European Register of Marine Species]] and the UNESCO-IOC Register of Marine Organisms (URMO), which was compiled by Jacob van der Land  (and several colleagues) at the National Museum of Natural History, Leiden &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinespecies.org/about.php|title=About|publisher=World Register of Marine Species|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily funded by the [[European Union]] and hosted by the [[Flanders Marine Institute]] in [[Ostend]], Belgium.  WoRMS has established formal agreements with several other biodiversity projects, including the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]] and the [[Encyclopedia of Life]]. In 2008, WoRMS stated that it hoped to have an up-to-date record of all marine species completed by 2010, the year in which the [[Census of Marine Life]] was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14206-how-many-species-live-in-the-sea.html|title=How many species live in the sea? |date=2008-06-25 |author=Catherine Brahic|publisher=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of February 2018, WoRMS contained listings for 480,931 marine species names (including synonyms) of which 240,633 are valid marine species (95 % checked). Their goal is to have a listing for each of the approximately more than 240,000 marine species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marinespecies.org|title=WoRMS - World Register of Marine Species|publisher=World Register of Marine Species|accessdate=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costello|first1=MJ|last2=Bouchet|first2=P|last3=Boxshall|first3=GW|last4=Fauchald|first4=K|last5=Gordon|first5=DP|last6=et|first6=al.|title=Global coordination and standardisation in marine biodiversity through the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and related databases|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2013|volume=8|issue=1|pages=e51629|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051629|pmid=23505408|pmc=3541386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30555">{{DISPLAYTITLE:{{pi}}-calculus}}
In [[theoretical computer science]], the '''{{pi}}-calculus''' (or '''pi-calculus''') is a [[process calculus]]. The {{pi}}-calculus allows channel names to be communicated along the channels themselves, and in this way it is able to describe [[concurrent computation]]s whose network configuration may change during the computation.

The {{pi}}-calculus is simple, it has very few terms and so is a very small language {{crossreference|selfref=no|(see [[#Syntax]])}}, yet is very expressive. Functional programs can be encoded into the {{pi}}-calculus, and the encoding emphasises the dialogue nature of computation, drawing connections with [[game semantics]]. Extensions of the {{pi}}-calculus, such as the spi calculus and applied {{pi}}, have been successful in reasoning about [[cryptographic protocol]]s. Beside the original use in describing concurrent systems, the {{pi}}-calculus has also been used to reason about [[business process]]es&lt;ref name="omg"&gt;OMG Specification (2011). [http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0 "Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) Version 2.0"], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Management_Group ''Object Management Group'']. p.21&lt;/ref&gt; and [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref name="reeve" /&gt;

== Informal definition ==
The {{pi}}-calculus belongs to the family of [[process calculi]], mathematical formalisms for describing and analyzing properties of concurrent computation. In fact, the {{pi}}-calculus, like the [[lambda calculus|λ-calculus]], is so minimal that it does not contain primitives such as numbers, booleans, data structures, variables, functions, or even the usual control flow statements (such as &lt;code&gt;if-then-else&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;).

=== Process constructs ===

Central to the {{pi}}-calculus is the notion of ''name''. The simplicity of the calculus lies in the dual role that names play as ''communication channels'' and ''variables''.

The process constructs available in the calculus are the following&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/jeannette-wing/pi.pdf|title=FAQ on π-Calculus|last=Wing|first=Jeannette M.|date=27 December 2002|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a precise definition is given in the following section):

* ''concurrency'', written &lt;math&gt;P \mid Q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are two processes or threads executed concurrently.
* ''communication'', where
** ''input prefixing'' &lt;math&gt;c\left(x\right).P&lt;/math&gt; is a process waiting for a message that was sent on a communication channel named &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; before proceeding as {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;,}} binding the name received to the name {{nowrap|{{mvar|x}}.}} Typically, this models either a process expecting a communication from the network or a label &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; usable only once by a &lt;code&gt;goto c&lt;/code&gt; operation.
** ''output prefixing''  &lt;math&gt;\overline{c} \langle y \rangle.P&lt;/math&gt; describes that the name &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is emitted on channel &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; before proceeding as {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.}} Typically, this models either sending a message on the network or a &lt;code&gt;goto c&lt;/code&gt; operation.
* ''replication'', written &lt;math&gt;!\,P&lt;/math&gt;, which may be seen as a process which can always create a new copy of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.}} Typically, this models either a network service or a label &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; waiting for any number of &lt;code&gt;goto c&lt;/code&gt; operations.
* ''creation of a new name'', written &lt;math&gt;\left(\nu x\right)P&lt;/math&gt;, which may be seen as a process allocating a new constant {{mvar|x}} within {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.}} The constants of {{nowrap|{{pi}}-calculus}} are defined by their names only and are always communication channels. Creation of a new name in a process is also called ''restriction''.
* the nil process, written &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, is a process whose execution is complete and has stopped.

Although the minimalism of the {{pi}}-calculus prevents us from writing programs in the normal sense, it is easy to extend the calculus. In particular, it is easy to define both control structures such as recursion, loops and sequential composition and datatypes such as first-order functions, [[truth value]]s, lists and integers. Moreover, extensions of the {{nowrap|{{pi}}-calculus}} have been proposed which take into account distribution or public-key cryptography. The ''applied {{nowrap|{{pi}}-calculus}}'' due to Abadi and Fournet [http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/~abadi/Papers/isss02.pdf] put these various extensions on a formal footing by extending the {{nowrap|{{pi}}-calculus}} with arbitrary datatypes.

=== A small example ===

Below is a tiny example of a process which consists of three parallel components. The channel name {{mvar|x}} is only known by the first two components.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

    &amp;  \begin{align}
                (\nu x) \; &amp; ( \; \overline{x} \langle z \rangle . \; 0 \\
                           &amp; | \; x(y). \; \overline{y}\langle x \rangle . \; x(y). \; 0 \; )
        \end{align} \\
| \; &amp; z(v) . \; \overline{v}\langle v \rangle . 0

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first two components are able to communicate on the channel {{mvar|x}}, and the name &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; becomes bound to &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The next step in the process is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

  &amp; \begin{align}
      ( \nu x) \; ( \; &amp; 0 \\
                  | \; &amp; \overline{z} \langle x \rangle . \; x(y). \; 0 \; )
    \end{align}

  \\

| \; &amp; z(v). \; \overline{v}\langle v \rangle . \; 0

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the remaining &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not affected because it is defined in an inner scope.
The second and third parallel components can now communicate on the channel name &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, and the name &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; becomes bound to {{mvar|x}}. The next step in the process is now

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

 (\nu x)        ( \; &amp; 0 \\
                | \; &amp; x(y). \; 0  \\
                | \; &amp; \overline{x}\langle x \rangle . \; 0 \; )

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that since the local name {{mvar|x}} has been output, the scope of {{mvar|x}} is extended to cover the third component as well. Finally, the channel {{mvar|x}} can be used for sending the name {{mvar|x}}. After that all concurrently executing processes have stopped

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

 (\nu x)        ( \; &amp; 0 \\
                | \; 0  \\
                | \; 0 \; )

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Formal definition ==

=== Syntax ===

Let Χ be a set of objects called ''names''. The [[abstract syntax]] for the {{pi}}-calculus is built from the following [[BNF grammar]] (where ''x'' and ''y'' are any names from Χ):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/reports/89/ECS-LFCS-89-85/ A Calculus of Mobile Processes part 1] page 10, by R. Milner, J. Parrow and D. Walker published in Information and Computation 100(1) pp.1-40, Sept 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P, Q, R ::= \, &amp; x(y).P \,\,\, \, \, &amp; \text{Receive on channel }x\text{, bind the result to }y\text{, then run }P \\
|\,\,\, &amp; \overline{x} \langle y \rangle.P \,\,\, \, \, &amp;\text{Send the value }y\text{ over channel }x\text{, then run }P \\
|\,\,\, &amp; P|Q \,\,\, \, \, \, \, \, \, &amp;\text{Run }P\text{ and }Q\text{ simultaneously} \\
|\,\,\, &amp; (\nu x)P  \,\,\, &amp;\text{Create a new channel }x\text{ and run }P \\
|\,\,\, &amp; !P \,\,\, &amp;\text{Repeatedly spawn copies of }P \\
|\,\,\, &amp; 0 &amp; \text{Terminate the process}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the concrete syntax below, the prefixes bind more tightly than the parallel composition (|), and parentheses are used to disambiguate.

Names are bound by the restriction and input prefix constructs. Formally, the set of free names of a process in {{pi}}–calculus are defined inductively by the table below. The set of bound names of a process are defined as the names of a process that are not in the set of free names.
{| class="wikitable" style="width: 100%;"
! Construct
! Free names
|-
| &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
| None
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\overline{a} \langle x \rangle.P&lt;/math&gt;
| ''a''; ''x''; all free names of ''P''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;a(x).P&lt;/math&gt;
| ''a''; free names of ''P'' except for ''x''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;P|Q&lt;/math&gt;
| All free names of ''P'' and ''Q''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;(\nu x).P&lt;/math&gt;
| Free names of ''P'' except for ''x''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;!P&lt;/math&gt;
| All free names of ''P''
|}

=== Structural congruence ===

Central to both the reduction semantics and the labelled transition semantics is the notion of '''structural congruence'''. Two processes are structurally congruent, if they are identical up to structure. In particular, parallel composition is commutative and associative.

More precisely, structural congruence is defined as the least equivalence relation preserved by the process constructs and satisfying:

''Alpha-conversion'':

:* &lt;math&gt;P \equiv Q&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by renaming one or more bound names in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

''Axioms for parallel composition'':

:* &lt;math&gt;P|Q \equiv Q|P&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt;(P|Q)|R \equiv P|(Q|R)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;P | 0 \equiv P&lt;/math&gt;

''Axioms for restriction'':

:* &lt;math&gt;(\nu x)(\nu y)P \equiv (\nu y)(\nu x)P&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt;(\nu x)0 \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;

''Axiom for replication'':

:* &lt;math&gt;!P \equiv P|!P&lt;/math&gt;

''Axiom relating restriction and parallel'':

:* &lt;math&gt;(\nu x)(P | Q) \equiv (\nu x)P | Q &lt;/math&gt; if {{mvar|x}} is not a free name of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

This last axiom is known as the "scope extension" axiom. This axiom is central, since it describes how a bound name {{mvar|x}} may be extruded by an output action, causing the scope of {{mvar|x}} to be extended. In cases where {{mvar|x}} is a free name of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, alpha-conversion may be used to allow extension to proceed.

=== Reduction semantics ===

We write &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow P'&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can perform a computation step, following which it is now &lt;math&gt;P'&lt;/math&gt;.
This ''reduction relation'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the least relation closed under a set of reduction rules.

The main reduction rule which captures the ability of processes to communicate through channels is the following:
* &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}\langle z \rangle.P | x(y).Q \rightarrow P | Q[z/y] &lt;/math&gt;
: where &lt;math&gt;Q[z/y]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the process &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; in which the free name &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; has been ''substituted'' for the free occurrences of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. If a free occurrence of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; occurs in a location where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; would not be free, alpha-conversion may be required.

There are three additional rules:
* If &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; then also &lt;math&gt;P|R \rightarrow Q|R&lt;/math&gt;.
: This rule says that parallel composition does not inhibit computation.
* If &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, then also &lt;math&gt;(\nu x)P \rightarrow (\nu x)Q&lt;/math&gt;.
: This rule ensures that computation can proceed underneath a restriction.
* If &lt;math&gt;P \equiv P'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P' \rightarrow Q'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q' \equiv Q&lt;/math&gt;, then also &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;.

The latter rule states that processes that are structurally congruent have the same reductions.

=== The example revisited ===

Consider again the process

:&lt;math&gt; (\nu x)(\overline{x} \langle z \rangle.0  |  x(y).   \overline{y}\langle x \rangle . x(y).0 ) | z(v) . \overline{v}\langle v \rangle. 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Applying the definition of the reduction semantics, we get the reduction

:&lt;math&gt; (\nu x)(\overline{x} \langle z \rangle.0  |  x(y).   \overline{y}\langle x \rangle . x(y).0 ) | z(v) . \overline{v}\langle v \rangle. 0  \rightarrow (\nu x)(0|  \overline{z}\langle x \rangle . x(y). 0 ) | z(v). \overline{v}\langle v \rangle .0 &lt;/math&gt;

Note how, applying the reduction substitution axiom, free occurrences of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are now labeled as &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.

Next, we get the reduction

:&lt;math&gt; (\nu x)(0|  \overline{z}\langle x \rangle . x(y). 0 ) | z(v). \overline{v}\langle v \rangle .0 \rightarrow (\nu x)(0|  x(y). 0  | \overline{x}\langle x \rangle .0)  &lt;/math&gt;

Note that since the local name {{mvar|x}} has been output, the scope of {{mvar|x}} is extended to cover the third component as well.  This was captured using the scope extension axiom.

Next, using the reduction substitution axiom, we get

:&lt;math&gt; (\nu x)(0 | 0 | 0) &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, using the axioms for parallel composition and restriction, we get

:&lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Labelled semantics ===

Alternatively, one may give the pi-calculus a labelled transition semantics (as has been done with the [[Calculus of Communicating Systems]]). Transitions in this semantics are of the form:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
P\,\xrightarrow{\overset{}\alpha} P'
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
This [[State transition system|notation]] signifies that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; after the action &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;P'&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can be an ''input action'' &lt;math&gt;a(x)&lt;/math&gt;, an ''output action'' ''&lt;math&gt;\overline{a}\langle x \rangle&lt;/math&gt;'', or a tau-action {{mvar|&amp;tau;}} corresponding to an internal communication.

A standard result about the labelled semantics is that it agrees with the reduction semantics in the sense that 
&lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow P'&lt;/math&gt; if and only if 
&lt;math&gt;P\,\xrightarrow{\overset{}\tau} P'&lt;/math&gt; for some action &amp;tau;.

== Extensions and variants ==

The syntax given above is a minimal one. However, the syntax may be modified in various ways.

A ''nondeterministic choice operator'' &lt;math&gt;P + Q&lt;/math&gt; can be added to the syntax.

A test for ''name equality'' &lt;math&gt;[x=y]P&lt;/math&gt; can be added to the syntax. This ''match operator'' can proceed as &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if {{mvar|x}} and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are the same name.
Similarly, one may add a ''mismatch operator'' for '''name inequality'''. Practical programs which can pass names (URLs or pointers) often use such functionality: for directly modelling such functionality inside the calculus, this and related extensions are often useful.

The ''asynchronous {{pi}}-calculus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boudol|first1=G.|title=Asynchrony and the {{pi}}-calculus. Techical Report 1702, INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis| date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Honda |first1=K. | last2=Tokoro | first2=M. |title=An Object Calculus for Asynchronous Communication. ECOOP 91|publisher=Springer Verlag| date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
allows only outputs with no suffix, i.e. output atoms of the form &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}\langle y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, yielding a smaller calculus. However, any process in the original calculus can be represented by the smaller asynchronous {{pi}}-calculus using an extra channel to simulate explicit acknowledgement from the receiving process. Since a continuation-free output can model a message-in-transit, this fragment shows that the original {{pi}}-calculus, which is intuitively based on synchronous communication, has an expressive asynchronous communication model inside its syntax. However, the nondeterministic choice operator defined above cannot be expressed in this way, as an [[guard (computer science)|unguarded]] choice would be converted into a guarded one; this fact has been used to demonstrate that the asynchronous calculus is strictly less expressive than the synchronous one (with the choice operator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palamidessi|first=Catuscia|title=Comparing the expressive power of the Synchronous and the Asynchronous pi-calculus|journal=Proceedings of the 24th ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages|year=1997|pages=256–265|arxiv=cs/9809008|accessdate=|bibcode=1998cs........9008P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''polyadic {{pi}}-calculus'' allows communicating more than one name in a single action: &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}\langle z_1,...,z_n\rangle.P&lt;/math&gt; ''(polyadic output)'' and &lt;math&gt;x(z_1,...,z_n).P&lt;/math&gt; ''(polyadic input)''. This polyadic extension, which is useful especially when studying types for name passing processes,  can be encoded in the monadic calculus by passing the name of a private channel through which the multiple arguments are then passed in sequence. The encoding is defined recursively by the clauses

&lt;math&gt;\overline{x}\langle y_1,\cdots,y_n\rangle.P&lt;/math&gt; is encoded as &lt;math&gt;(\nu w) \overline{x}\langle w \rangle.\overline{w}\langle y_1\rangle.\cdots.\overline{w}\langle y_n\rangle.[P]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x(y_1,\cdots,y_n).P&lt;/math&gt; is encoded as &lt;math&gt;x(w).w(y_1).\cdots.w(y_n).[P]&lt;/math&gt;

All other process constructs are left unchanged by the encoding.

In the above, &lt;math&gt;[P]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the encoding of all prefixes in the continuation &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in the same way.

The full power of replication &lt;math&gt;!P&lt;/math&gt; is not needed. Often, one only considers ''replicated input'' &lt;math&gt;! x(y).P&lt;/math&gt;, whose structural congruence axiom is &lt;math&gt;! x(y).P \equiv x(y).P | !x(y).P&lt;/math&gt;.

Replicated input process such as &lt;math&gt; !x(y).P&lt;/math&gt; can be understood as servers, waiting on channel
{{mvar|x}} to be invoked by clients. Invocation of a server spawns a new copy of
the process &lt;math&gt;P[a/y]&lt;/math&gt;, where a is the name passed by the client to the
server, during the latter's invocation.

A ''higher order {{pi}}-calculus'' can be defined where not only names but processes are sent through channels.
The key reduction rule for the higher order case is

&lt;math&gt;\overline{x}\langle R \rangle.P | x(Y).Q \rightarrow P | Q[R/Y] &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; denotes a ''process variable'' which can be instantiated by a process term. Sangiorgi
established that the ability to pass processes does not
increase the expressivity of the {{pi}}-calculus: passing a process ''P'' can be
simulated by just passing a name that points to ''P'' instead.

== Properties ==

=== Turing completeness ===

The {{pi}}-calculus is a [[Turing complete|universal model of computation]]. This was first observed by Milner in his paper "Functions as Processes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milner|first=Robin|title=Functions as Processes|journal=Mathematical Structures in Computer Science|pages=119–141|year=1992|volume=2|doi=10.1017/s0960129500001407|url=http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/07/54/05/PDF/RR-1154.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he presents two encodings of the [[lambda-calculus]] in the {{pi}}-calculus. One encoding simulates the eager (call-by-value) [[evaluation strategy]], the other encoding simulates the normal-order (call-by-name) strategy. In both of these, the crucial insight is the modeling of environment bindings – for instance, "{{mvar|x}} is bound to term &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;" – as replicating agents that respond to requests for their bindings by sending back a connection to the term &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

The features of the {{pi}}-calculus that make these encodings possible are name-passing and replication (or, equivalently, recursively defined agents). In the absence of replication/recursion, the {{pi}}-calculus ceases to be [[Turing]]-powerful. This can be seen by the fact that [[bisimulation]] equivalence becomes decidable for the recursion-free calculus and even for the finite-control {{pi}}-calculus where the number of parallel components in any process is bounded by a constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dam|first=Mads|title=On the Decidability of Process Equivalences for the pi-Calculus|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|issue=183|pages=215–228|year=1997|volume=183|doi=10.1016/S0304-3975(96)00325-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bisimulations in the {{pi}}-calculus ==

{{See also|Bisimulation}}

As for process calculi, the {{pi}}-calculus allows for a definition of bisimulation equivalence. In the {{pi}}-calculus, the definition of bisimulation equivalence (also known as bisimilarity) may be based on either the reduction semantics or on the labelled transition semantics.

There are (at least) three different ways of defining ''labelled bisimulation equivalence'' in the {{pi}}-calculus: Early, late and open bisimilarity. This stems from the fact that the {{pi}}-calculus is a value-passing process calculus.

In the remainder of this section, we let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; denote processes and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; denote binary relations over processes.

=== Early and late bisimilarity ===

Early and late bisimilarity were both formulated by Milner, Parrow and Walker in their original paper on the {{pi}}-calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milner|first=R.|author2=J. Parrow |author3= D. Walker|title=A calculus of mobile processes|journal=Information and Computation|issue=1|pages=1–40|year=1992|doi=10.1016/0890-5401(92)90008-4|volume=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A binary relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; over processes is an ''early bisimulation'' if for every pair of processes &lt;math&gt;(p, q) \in R&lt;/math&gt;,
* whenever &lt;math&gt;
p \,\xrightarrow{a(x)}\,p'
&lt;/math&gt; then for every name &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; there exists some &lt;math&gt;q'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;
q \,\xrightarrow{a(x)}\,q'
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(p'[y/x],q'[y/x]) \in R&lt;/math&gt;;
* for any non-input action &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;{
p \xrightarrow{\overset{}{\alpha}}  p'
}  &lt;/math&gt; then there exists some &lt;math&gt;q'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;
q \xrightarrow{\overset{}{\alpha}} q'
  &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(p',q') \in R&lt;/math&gt;;
* and symmetric requirements with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; interchanged.

Processes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are said to be early bisimilar, written &lt;math&gt;p \sim_e q&lt;/math&gt; if the pair &lt;math&gt;(p,q) \in R&lt;/math&gt; for some early bisimulation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

In late bisimilarity, the transition match must be independent of the name being transmitted.
A binary relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; over processes is a ''late bisimulation'' if for every pair of processes &lt;math&gt;(p, q) \in R&lt;/math&gt;,
* whenever &lt;math&gt;
p \xrightarrow{a(x)}  p'
&lt;/math&gt; then for some &lt;math&gt;q'&lt;/math&gt; it holds that &lt;math&gt;
q \xrightarrow{a(x)} q'
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(p'[y/x],q'[y/x]) \in R&lt;/math&gt; ''for every name y'';
*for any non-input action &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;
p \xrightarrow{\overset{}{\alpha}} p'
  &lt;/math&gt; implies that there exists some &lt;math&gt;q'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;
q \xrightarrow{\overset{}{\alpha}} q'
  &lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;(p',q') \in R&lt;/math&gt;;
* and symmetric requirements with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; interchanged.
Processes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are said to be late bisimilar, written &lt;math&gt;p \sim_l q&lt;/math&gt; if the pair &lt;math&gt;(p,q) \in R&lt;/math&gt; for some late bisimulation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

Both &lt;math&gt;\sim_e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sim_l&lt;/math&gt; suffer from the problem that they are not ''congruence relations'' in the sense that they are not preserved by all process constructs. More precisely, there exist processes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p \sim_e q&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;a(x).p \not \sim_e a(x).q&lt;/math&gt;. One may remedy this problem by considering the maximal congruence relations included in &lt;math&gt;\sim_e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sim_l&lt;/math&gt;, known as ''early congruence'' and ''late congruence'', respectively.

=== Open bisimilarity ===

Fortunately, a third definition is possible, which avoids this problem, namely that of ''open bisimilarity'', due to Sangiorgi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sangiorgi|first=D.|title=A theory of bisimulation for the π-calculus|journal=Acta Informatica|volume=33|pages=69–97|year=1996|doi=10.1007/s002360050036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A binary relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; over processes is an ''open bisimulation'' if for every pair of elements &lt;math&gt;(p, q) \in R&lt;/math&gt; and for every name substitution &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and every action &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;
p\sigma \xrightarrow{\overset{}{\alpha}}  p'&lt;/math&gt; then there exists some &lt;math&gt;q'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;
q\sigma  \xrightarrow{\overset{}{\alpha}} q'
  &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(p',q') \in R&lt;/math&gt;.

Processes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are said to be open bisimilar, written &lt;math&gt;p \sim_o q&lt;/math&gt; if the pair &lt;math&gt;(p,q) \in R&lt;/math&gt; for some open bisimulation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Early, late and open bisimilarity are distinct ====

Early, late and open bisimilarity are distinct. The containments are proper, so &lt;math&gt;\sim_o \subsetneq \sim_l \subsetneq \sim_e&lt;/math&gt;.

In certain subcalculi such as the asynchronous pi-calculus, late, early and open bisimilarity are known to coincide. However, in this setting a more appropriate notion is that of ''asynchronous bisimilarity''.

The reader should note that, in the literature, the term ''open bisimulation'' usually refers to a more sophisticated notion, where processes and relations are indexed by distinction relations; details are in Sangiorgi's paper cited above.

=== Barbed equivalence ===

Alternatively, one may define bisimulation equivalence directly from the reduction semantics. We write &lt;math&gt;p \Downarrow a&lt;/math&gt; if process &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; immediately allows an input or an output on name &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

A binary relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; over processes is a ''barbed bisimulation'' if it is a symmetric relation which satisfies that for every pair of elements &lt;math&gt;(p, q) \in R&lt;/math&gt; we have that

:(1) &lt;math&gt;p \Downarrow a&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;q \Downarrow a&lt;/math&gt; for every name &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;

and

:(2) for every reduction &lt;math&gt; p \rightarrow p'&lt;/math&gt; there exists a reduction &lt;math&gt; q \rightarrow  q' &lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;(p',q') \in R&lt;/math&gt;.

We say that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are ''barbed bisimilar'' if there exists a barbed bisimulation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;(p,q) \in R&lt;/math&gt;.

Defining a context as a {{pi}} term with a hole [] we say that two processes P and Q are ''barbed congruent'', written &lt;math&gt;P \sim_b Q\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, if for every context &lt;math&gt;C[] &lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;C[P]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C[Q]&lt;/math&gt; are barbed bisimilar. It turns out that barbed congruence coincides with the congruence induced by early bisimilarity.

== Applications ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[SPI]] --&gt;

The {{pi}}-calculus has been used to describe many different kinds of concurrent systems. In fact, some of the most recent applications lie outside the realm of traditional computer science.

In 1997, [[Martin Abadi]] and Andrew Gordon proposed an extension of the {{pi}}-calculus, the [[Spi-calculus]], as a formal notation for describing and reasoning about cryptographic protocols. The spi-calculus extends the {{pi}}-calculus with primitives for encryption and decryption. In 2001, [[Martin Abadi]] and Cedric Fournet generalised the handling of cryptographic protocols to produce the applied {{pi}} calculus. There is now a large body of work devoted to variants of the applied {{pi}} calculus, including a number of experimental verification tools. One example is the tool [[ProVerif]] [http://www.proverif.ens.fr/] due to [[Bruno Blanchet]], based on a translation of the applied {{pi}}-calculus into Blanchet's logic programming framework. Another example is Cryptyc [http://www.cryptyc.org], due to Andrew Gordon and Alan Jeffrey, which uses Woo and Lam's method of correspondence assertions as the basis for type systems that can check for authentication properties of cryptographic protocols.

Around 2002, Howard Smith and [[Peter Fingar]] became interested that {{pi}}-calculus would become a description tool for modelling business processes. By July 2006, there is discussion in the community about how useful this would be. Most recently, the {{pi}}-calculus has formed the theoretical basis of [[Business Process Modeling Language]] (BPML), and of Microsoft's XLANG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpmi.org/downloads/BPML-BPEL4WS.pdf "BPML | BPEL4WS: A Convergence Path toward a Standard BPM Stack."] BPMI.org Position Paper.

The {{pi}}-calculus has also attracted interest in molecular biology. In 1999, [[Aviv Regev]] and [[Ehud Shapiro]] showed that one can describe a cellular signaling pathway (the so-called [[Receptor tyrosine kinase|RTK]]/[[MAPK]] cascade)  and in particular the molecular "lego" which implements these tasks of communication in an extension of the {{pi}}-calculus.&lt;ref name="reeve"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Aviv|last=Regev|authorlink=Aviv Regev|author2=William Silverman |author3= Ehud Y.

== History ==
The {{pi}}-calculus was originally developed by [[Robin Milner]], Joachim Parrow and [[David Walker (computer scientist)|David Walker]] in 1992, based on ideas by Uffe Engberg and Mogens Nielsen. It can be seen as a continuation of Milner's work on the process calculus CCS ([[Calculus of Communicating Systems]]).  In his Turing lecture, Milner describes the development of the {{pi}}-calculus as an attempt to capture the uniformity of values and processes in actors.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Milner. 1993. Elements of interaction: Turing award lecture. Commun. ACM 36, 1 (January 1993), 78-89. DOI=10.1145/151233.151240 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/151233.151240&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementations ==

The following programming languages are implementations either of the {{pi}}-calculus or of its variants:

* [[Business Process Modeling Language]] (BPML)
* [[occam-π]]
* [[Pict programming language|Pict]]
* [[JoCaml]] (based on the [[Join-calculus]])
