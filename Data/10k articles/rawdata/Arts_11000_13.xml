'''"Africa"''' is a song by the American [[rock music|rock]] band [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. It was included on their fourth [[studio album]] ''[[Toto IV]],'' and released as a single on September 30, 1982. It reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart on February 5, 1983 (the band's only Billboard number one), and number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]] the same month. The song was written and composed by the band members [[David Paich]] and [[Jeff Porcaro]].

The song saw a resurgence in popularity via social media during the 2010s. In the midst of the song's growing popularity, the band [[Weezer]] recorded a cover version in 2018 that peaked at number 51 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and number one on the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Songs]] chart.&lt;ref name=Weezer&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8460758/weezer-africa-no-89-hot-100 |title=Weezer Returns to Hot 100 With Fan-Inspired Cover of Toto's 'Africa' |last=Zellner |first=Xander |publisher=Billboard |date=June 13, 2018 |access-date=June 15, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., the single was initially [[RIAA Certification|certified gold]] by the RIAA in 1991. However, since its renewed popularity, sales of both the original Toto single and the Weezer cover have surged, with the original single certified platinum in 2017, and most recently 4x Platinum in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;se=toto+africa#search_section&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The initial idea and lyrics for the song came from [[David Paich]]. [[Jeff Porcaro]] explains the idea behind the song: "A white boy is trying to write a song on [[Africa]], but since he's never been there, he can only tell what he's seen on TV or remembers in the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toto99.com/blog/ency.php?/archives/269-AFRICA.html |title=Official TOTO Website - Encyclopedia |publisher=www.toto99.com |date=April 18, 2007 |accessdate=December 2, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714003540/http://www.toto99.com/blog/ency.php?%2Farchives%2F269-AFRICA.html |archivedate=July 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paich said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the beginning of the '80s I watched a late night documentary on TV about all the terrible death and suffering of the people in Africa. It both moved and appalled me, and the pictures just wouldn't leave my head. I tried to imagine how I'd feel about if I was there and what I'd do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.toto99.com/releases/toto/balladsrelease.shtml |title=Official TOTO Website - Releases |publisher=www.toto99.com |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928151620/http://www.toto99.com/releases/toto/balladsrelease.shtml |archivedate=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2015, Paich explained that the song is about a man's love of a continent, Africa, rather than just a personal romance.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite web |title= Q&amp;'80s: Toto's Dave Paich on Writing and Recording 'Africa' |author= Melissa Locker |date= May 5, 2015 |website= Grantland.com |url= http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/q80s-totos-dave-paich-on-writing-and-recording-africa/ |at= (end paragraph 2 and 8) |accessdate= June 4, 2016 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160625035656/http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/q80s-totos-dave-paich-on-writing-and-recording-africa/ |archivedate= June 25, 2016 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Paich explained the song is about a person flying in to meet a lonely missionary.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/30/toto-how-we-made-africa|title=Toto: how we made Africa|first=Dave|last=Simpson|date=January 30, 2018|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a child, Paich attended a Catholic school. Several of the teachers had done missionary work in Africa, and this became the inspiration behind the line "I bless the rains down in Africa."&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

Paich was playing around with a new keyboard and found the brassy sound that became the opening riff. He started humming a melody and by the chorus, the words just came to him.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

Musically, the song took quite some time to assemble, as Paich and Porcaro explain:

{{quote|On "Africa" you hear a combination of [[marimba]] with [[List of Yamaha products#Digital stage pianos|GS 1]]. The [[Mbira|kalimba]] is all done with the GS 1; it's six tracks of GS 1 playing different rhythms. I wrote the song on [[Yamaha CS-80|CS-80]], so that plays the main part of the entire tune.&lt;ref&gt;Keyboard, 09/1995&lt;/ref&gt;

So when we were doing "Africa" I set up a [[bass drum]], [[snare drum]] and a [[hi-hat]], and Lenny Castro set up right in front of me with a [[conga drum|conga]]. We looked at each other and just started playing the basic groove. [...] The backbeat is on 3, so it's a half-time feel, and it's 16th notes on the hi-hat. Lenny started playing a conga pattern. We played for five minutes on tape, no click, no nothing. We just played. And I was singing the bass line for 'Africa' in my mind, so we had a relative tempo. Lenny and I went into the booth and listened back to the five minutes of that same boring pattern. We picked out the best two bars that we thought were grooving, and we marked those two bars on tape. [...] Maybe it would have taken two minutes to program that in the [[Linn LM-1|Linn]], and it took about half an hour to do this. But a Linn machine doesn't feel like that!}}

Porcaro also acknowledged that he was influenced by the sounds created by fellow [[Los Angeles]] [[session musicians]] [[Milt Holland]] and [[Emil Richards]]. He also described the influence of the drummers at the Africa pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] and a National Geographic Special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/classic-tracks-totos-africa/375305 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 1, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701111032/http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/classic-tracks-totos-africa/375305 |archivedate=July 1, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flans|first=Robyn|date=November 1988|title=Jeff Porcaro: the feel of the music|url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/|journal=Modern Drummer|volume=|pages=|archive-url=http://www.toto-music.net/jeff_tribute/prasa/prasa13.php|archive-date=2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;I was about 11 when the New York World's Fair took place, and I went to the African pavilion with my family. I saw the real thing ... It was the first time I witnessed somebody playing one beat and not straying from it, like a religious experience, where it gets loud, and everyone goes into a trance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During an appearance on the radio station [[KROQ-FM]], [[Steve Porcaro]] and [[Steve Lukather]] described the song as "dumb" and "an experiment" and some of the lyrics as "goofy" that were just placeholders.&lt;ref name="KROQ-FM"&gt;{{cite podcast |url=https://omny.fm/shows/kroqfm-on-demand/interview-toto-covers-weezers-hash-pipe |title=Stryker Chats with Toto About Weezer 'Hash Pipe' Cover |website=Omny Studio |publisher=[[KROQ-FM|KROQFM: On-Demand]] |host= |date=2018-07-28 |time= |access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the last song recorded and barely made the album.&lt;ref name="KROQ-FM"/&gt; The band was more focused on the album's lead single "[[Rosanna (song)|Rosanna]]" instead.

==Music video==
The music video was directed by [[Steve Barron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=28175 |title=Toto - "Africa" |publisher=mvdbase.com |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606035642/http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=28175 |archivedate=June 6, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, a researcher in a library (portrayed by band member David Paich) tries to match a scrap of a picture of a shield to the book from which it was torn out. As he continues his search, a librarian (Jenny Douglas-McRae) working at a nearby desk takes occasional notice of him, while natives in the surrounding jungle begin to close in on the library. When the researcher finds a book titled ''Africa,'' the native throws a spear (the shield the native carries is the same as the one in the picture), toppling stacks of books. ''Africa'' falls open to the page from which the scrap was torn, but a lantern lands on it and sets it on fire, after which the librarian's eyeglasses are shown falling to the floor. The scenes are intercut with shots of a spinning globe and the band performing atop a stack of giant hardcover books, in which ''Africa'' is the topmost.

This video also features [[Mike Porcaro]] on bass, replacing [[David Hungate]], who had already left the band before the video was made. [[Lenny Castro]] is also featured in the video on percussion.

==Reception==
Although the song was popular upon its release, hitting No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in February 1983, the song has retained cultural popularity throughout the 21st century in the [[United States of America|U.S.]] The song has been utilized in many internet memes,&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2018/10/18/the-mother-all-memes-waiting-there-for-you/6XXXUBqFtAhnnNj0VNozGJ/story.html |title=Toto's 'Africa': The mother of all memes is waiting there for you |work=bostonglobe.com |accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as making appearances in popular television shows, such as ''[[Stranger Things]]'' and ''[[South Park]]'', and being used by [[CBS]] during their coverage of the funeral of former [[South Africa|South African]] president [[Nelson Mandela]], albeit not without controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/toto-africa-the-new-anthem-747262/|title=How Toto's 'Africa' Became the New 'Don't Stop Believin''|work=RollingStone.com|accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, "Africa" was listed by music magazine ''[[NME]]'' in 32nd place on its list of "50 Most Explosive Choruses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/list/50-most-explosive-choruses/261186/article/261300|title=50 Most Explosive Choruses - #32 Toto - Africa - NME.COM|work=[[NME]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402171142/http://www.nme.com/list/50-most-explosive-choruses/261186/article/261300|archivedate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Weezer]] covered the song, following a fan-initiated social media campaign; it was released on May 29, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/hurry-its-waiting-there-for-you-weezer-covers-africa|title=Hurry, Boy, It’s Waiting There for You: Weezer Covers “Africa”|first=Amanda|last=Petrusich|work=The New Yorker|date=May 30, 2018|access-date=June 2, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, [[Twitter]] user "@WeezerAfrica," run by a 14-year-old [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]] resident Mary Klym,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McKinstry |first1=Lee |title=Teen Tweets Weezer Into Covering "Africa" |url=https://clevelandmagazine.com/entertainment/music/articles/teen-tweets-weezer-into-covering-toto's-africa |website=Cleveland Magazine |accessdate=August 13, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; tweeted, "''@RiversCuomo it's about time you bless the rains down in Africa''." After much back-and-forth between Mary and Weezer's drummer, [[Patrick Wilson (musician)|Patrick Wilson]], the band released a cover of "[[Rosanna (song)|Rosanna]]" in response to the popularity of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/weezer-cover-totos-rosanna-trolling-viral-campaign-for-africa-cover/|title=Weezer Cover Toto’s “Rosanna,” Trolling Viral Campaign for “Africa” Cover|last=Monroe|first=Jazz|publisher=Pitchfork|date=May 24, 2018|access-date=June 2, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weezer released "Africa" on May 29, 2018.

A limited edition [[Single (music)#7-inch format|7-inch vinyl pressing]] was released by Weezer in July 2018 and sold exclusively through [[Urban Outfitters]]. The pressing was limited to 1500 copies, with "Africa" as the A-side and "Rosanna" as the B-side. The cover artwork features a background of [[palm tree|palm fronds]] with the tweet that inspired the song in the center of the cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Trapp |first1=Phillip |title=Weezer Announce Limited Africa Vinyl, But Good Luck Getting One |url=https://www.altpress.com/news/weezer-africa-vinyl-toto-cover-urban-outfitters/ |website=Altpress |accessdate=August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = pitchfork&gt;{{cite web |title=Weezer’s “Africa” Cover Gets Vinyl Release |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/weezers-africa-cover-gets-vinyl-release/ |website=''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' |accessdate=August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agha Bozorg mosque''' ({{lang-fa|مسجد آقا بزرگ}} ''Masjed-e Āghā Bozorg'') is a historical [[mosque]] in [[Kashan]], Iran. The mosque was built in the late 18th century by master-[[mi'mar]] Ustad Haj Sa'ban-ali. The mosque and [[theological school]] (''madrasah'') is located in the center of the city.

Agha Bozorgh Mosque was constructed for prayers, preaching and teaching sessions held by Molla Mahdi Naraghi II also known as Mulla Mohammad Naraqi, known famously by his title of ''Āghā Bozorgh'' (literally meaning big or great lord) given to him by the Shah himself. Molla Mahdi Naraghi II was the son of the legendary Mulla Ahmad Naraqi (also spelled sometimes as Naraghi) who was the second strongest person in Iran after the king himself, [[Fath-Ali Shah Qajar]]. Mulla Ahmad Naraqi is well known for rallying the Iranian forces against the Russian invasion of northern Iran and declaring "jihad" or "holy war" against the invading Russians. He was successfully able to reconquer the Iranian lands that the invading Russian forces had captured during that offensive. Mulla Ahmad Naraqi, his brothers, his sons, and his father [[Mulla Muhammad Mahdi Naraqi]] famously known as Muhaqqiq Naraqi; are some of the most prominent Shi'a clerics as well as some of the most famous Islamic Iranian scientists of their time. Mulla Ahmad Naraqi and his father Muhaqqiq Naraqi are especially well known and honored to this day in Iran as the leading Islamic leaders of their time. It being the first time in Shi'a [[Twelver]] Islam that the helm of leadership of the faith was passed from father to son. Mulla Ahmad Naraqi was so accomplished in jurisprudence at the time of his father's passing (1209 AH/1795 CE) that it was agreed upon in a general consensus by the other leading figures of the time, to have Mulla Ahmad Naraqi as the next leader of the faith. Muhaqqiq Naraqi and Mulla Ahmad Naraqi's status in society at the time as leaders in both politics, jurisprudence, and faith can best be compared to the power and position held by Popes in the Catholic Church. They were in essence the leaders of the entire Twelver Shi'a world. With Mulla Ahmad Naraqi's passing in 1229 AH/1829 CE he was honored by being interred in the Shrine of [[Ali]]. His legacy holds as one of the most important and renowned Muslims in the past 1100 years and one of only a handful of Muslims who have been honored throughout history by being laid to rest in the Shrine of Imam Ali. 

==Specifications==
The mosque has been described as "the finest Islamic complex in Kashan and one of the best of the mid-19th century".&lt;ref name="Burke2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Andrew|title=Iran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gEca_4iSNCUC&amp;pg=PA228|date=15 September 2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74220-349-2|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted for its symmetrical design,&lt;ref name="PlanetBurke2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burke|first1=Andrew|last2=Maxwell|first2=Virginia|first3=Iain|last3=Shearer|title=Lonely Planet Iran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TY0GUQjhDX0C&amp;pg=PT366|date=1 June 2012|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74321-320-9|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; it consists of two large [[iwan]]s, one in front of the [[mihrab]] and the other by the entrance. The [[courtyard]] has a second court in the middle which comprises a garden with trees and a fountain. The iwan in front of mehrab has two minarets with a brick dome. It was here where [[Ustad Ali Maryam]] as a pupil started his career as an architect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12023">In [[literary theory]] and [[aesthetics]], '''authorial intent''' refers to an [[author]]'s [[intention|intent]] as it is encoded in his or her [[Work of art|work]]. '''Authorial intentionalism''' is the view, according to which an author's intentions should constrain the ways in which it is properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;A. Huddleston, "The Conversation Argument for Actual Intentionalism", ''British Journal of Aesthetics'' '''52'''(3):241–256 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary theory==
===New Criticism===
{{main|New Criticism}}
[[New Criticism]], as espoused by [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[W. K. Wimsatt]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and others, argued that authorial intent is irrelevant to understanding a work of literature. Wimsatt and [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue in their essay "The Intentional Fallacy" that "the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art".&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimsatt|first=W. K.|last2=Beardsley|first2=M. C.|date=1946|title=The Intentional Fallacy|jstor=27537676|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=54|issue=3|pages=468–488}} Revised and republished in {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Verbal_Icon.html?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC|title=The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry|date=1954|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813128579|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author, they argue, cannot be reconstructed from a [[writing]]—the text is the primary source of [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]], and any details of the author's desires or life are secondary. Wimsatt and Beardsley argue that even details about the work's composition or the author's intended meaning and purpose that might be found in other documents such as journals or letters are "private or idiosyncratic; not a part of the work as a linguistic fact" and are thus secondary to the trained reader's rigorous engagement with the text itself.&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley" /&gt;

Wimsatt and Beardsley divide the evidence used in making interpretations of poetry (although their analysis can be applied equally well to any type of art){{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} into three categories:

; Internal (or public) evidence: Internal evidence refers to what is presented within a given work. This internal evidence includes strong familiarity with the conventions of language and literature: it "is discovered through the semantics and syntax of a poem, through our habitual knowledge of the language, through grammars, dictionaries, and all the literature which is the source of dictionaries, in general through all that makes a language and culture". Analyzing a work of art based on internal evidence will not result in the intentional fallacy.
   
; External (or private) evidence: What is not literally contained in the work itself is external to that work, including all private or public statements that the artist has made about the work of art, whether in conversations, letters, journals, or other sources. Evidence of this type is directly concerned with what the artist may have intended to do even or especially when it is not apparent from the work itself. Analyzing a work of art based on external evidence will likely result in the intentional fallacy.

; Intermediate evidence:  The third type of evidence, intermediate evidence, includes "private or semiprivate meanings attached to words or topics by an author or by a coterie of which he is a member." Also included are "the history of words" and "the biography of an author, his use of a word, and the associations which the word had for him." Wimsatt and Beardsley argue for the use of intermediate evidence rather than external evidence in the interpretation of a literary work, but they recognize that these two types of evidence "shade into one another so subtly that it is not always easy to draw a line between" the two.

Thus, a text's internal evidence—the words themselves and their meanings—is open for literary analysis. External evidence—anything not contained within the text itself, such as statements made by the poet about the poem that is being interpreted—does not belong to literary criticism. Preoccupation with the authorial intent "leads away from the poem." According to Wimsatt and Beardsley, a poem does not belong to its author but rather "is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public."

===Psychoanalytic criticism===
{{main|Psychoanalytic literary criticism}}
In [[psychoanalytic criticism]], the author's biography and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] state were seen as part of the text, and therefore the author's intent could be revived from a literary text—although the intent might be an unconscious one.

===Cambridge School Contextualism===
{{main|Cambridge School (intellectual history)}}

The [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|Cambridge School]] of contextualist [[hermeneutics]], a position most elaborated by [[Quentin Skinner]], in the first instances distinguishes linguistic meaning from speech-acts: that is to say, things which the performance of an utterance ''does''. Consider the following. Typically, the ceremony of marriage concludes upon the exchange of the utterance "I do". In such a case, to utter "I do" is not merely to report an internal disposition, but to perform an action, namely, to ''get'' married. The intended force of "I do" in such a circumstance is only ever retrievable through understanding something about the complex social activity of marriage. Indeed, to understand a speech-act is to understand what conventions are regulating its significance. Since actions are always publicly legible—they are done by the speech itself—this presupposes no knowledge about the author's mental states. The task is always thus: with as much contextual information as possible, can we establish which conventions a text was interacting with, and by inference to the best explanation, what the author's intent was.

===Post-structuralism===
{{main|Post-structuralism}}
In [[post-structuralism]], there are a variety of approaches to authorial intent. For some of the theorists deriving from [[Jacques Lacan]], and in particular theories variously called ''[[écriture féminine]]'', gender and sex predetermine the ways that texts will emerge, and the language of textuality itself will present an argument that is potentially counter to the author's conscious intent.

===Marxist criticism===
{{main|Marxist literary criticism}}
For [[Marxist]] literary theorists, the author's intent is always a code for a particular set of ideologies in the author's own day.  For Marxists (especially those of the [[Soviet realism]] type), authorial intent is manifest in the text and must be placed in a context of liberation and the [[materialist dialectic]].  However, Marxist-derived theorists have seen authorial intent in a much more nuanced way.  [[Raymond Williams]], for example, posits literary productions always within a context of emerging, resistant, and synthetic ideological positions.  The author's intent is recoverable from the text, but there are always encoded within it several separate positions.  The author might be arguing consciously for empire, but hidden within that argument will be a response to a counterargument and a presentation of an emerging synthesis.  Some members of the [[reception theory]] group ([[Hans Robert Jauss]], in particular) have approximated the Marxist view by arguing that the forces of cultural reception reveal the ideological positions of both author and readership.

===Reader response===
{{main|Reader response}}
[[Reader response]] critics view the authorial intent variously.  In general, they have argued that the author's intent itself is immaterial and cannot be fully recovered.  However, the author's intent will shape the text and limit the possible [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s of a work.  The reader's ''impression'' of the author's intent is a working force in interpretation, but the author's actual intent is not.

===Weak intentionalism===
Weak intentionalism combines intentionalism with insights from reader response. [[Mark Bevir]]  in ''The Logic of the History of Ideas'' sees meanings as necessarily intentional but suggests that the relevant intentions can be those of readers as well as those of authors. Weak intentionalists privilege intentionality to emphasize that texts do not have meanings in themselves. They believe that meanings are always meanings for people—albeit the relevant people, whether authors or readers.

==In textual criticism==
Authorial intention is of great practical concern to some [[textual critic]]s. These are known as intentionalists and are identified with the Bowers-Tanselle school of thought. Their editions have as one of their most important goals the recovery of the author's intentions (generally final intentions). When preparing a work for the press, an editor working along the principles outlined by [[Fredson Bowers]] and [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] will attempt to construct a text that is close to the author's final intentions. For transcription and typesetting, authorial intentionality can be considered paramount.

An intentionalist editor would constantly investigate the [[document]]s for traces of authorial intention. On one hand, it can be argued that the author always intends whatever the author writes and that at different points in time the same author might have very different intentions. On the other hand, an author may in some cases write something he or she did not intend. For example, an intentionalist would consider for emendation the following cases:

*The authorial manuscript misspells a word: an error in intention, it is usually assumed. Editorial procedures for works available in no 'authorized editions' (and even those are not always exempt) often specify correcting such errors.
*The authorial manuscript presents what appears to be a misformat of the text: a sentence has been left in run-on form. It is assumed that the author might have regretted not beginning a new paragraph, but did not see this problem until afterwards, until rereading.
*The authorial manuscript presents a factual error.

In cases such as these where the author is living, they would be questioned by the editor who would then adhere to the intention expressed. In cases where the author is deceased, an intentionalist would attempt to approach authorial intention. The strongest voices countering an emphasis on authorial intent in scholarly editing have been [[D. F. McKenzie]] and [[Jerome McGann]], proponents of a model that accounts for the "social text," tracing material transformations and embodiments of works while not privileging one version over another.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6618">When studying [[literature]], '''biography and its relationship to literature''' is often a subject of [[literary criticism]], and is treated in several different forms. Two scholarly approaches use [[biography]] or biographical approaches to the past as a tool for interpreting literature: '''literary biography''' and [[biographical criticism]]. Additionally, two genres of fiction rely heavily on the incorporation of biographical elements into their content, [[biographical novel|biographical fiction]] and [[autofiction|autobiographical fiction]].

==Literary biography==
A literary biography is the biographical exploration of the lives of writers and artists. Biographies about artists and writers are sometimes some of the most complicated forms of biography.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; Not only does the author of the biography have to write about the subject of the biography but also must incorporate discussion of the individual's literary works into the biography itself.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt;&lt;ref name = karl&gt;Karl, Frederick R. "Joseph Conrad" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 69–88&lt;/ref&gt; Literary biographers must balance the weight of commentary on the individual works against the biographical content to create a coherent narrative.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; This balance is affected by the degree of biographical elements in an author's literary works. The close relationship between writers and their work relies on ideas that connect human psychology and literature and can be examined through [[psychoanalytic theory]].&lt;ref name = karl/&gt;

Literary biography tends to have a plethora of autobiographical sources. Elizabeth Longford, a biographer of [[Wilfrid Blunt]], noted, "Writers are articulate and tend to leave eloquent source material which the biographer will be eager to use."&lt;ref name= longford&gt;Longford, Elizabeth "Wilfrid Scawen Blunt" of Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 55-68&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors and artists go out of their way to discourage the writing of their biographies, as was the case with Kafka, Eliot, Orwell and Auden. Auden said, "Biographies of writers whether written by others or themselves are always superfluous and usually in bad taste.... His private life is, or should be, of no concern to anybody except himself, his family and his friends."&lt;ref name = meyers&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey "Introduction" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-received literary biographies include [[Richard Ellmann]]'s ''James Joyce'' and [[George Painter]]'s ''Marcel Proust''.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113&gt;Backschneider 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = meyers/&gt;

==Biographical criticism==
{{main|Biographical criticism}}
Biographical criticism is the deliberate use of biographical information to shed light on the difference created by experience between an author and his audience, and so provide insight into how to understand that particular work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Benson| first = Jackson J| year = 1989| jstor = 25111810| title = Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism| journal = College Literature| issue = 16| volume = 29| pages = 107–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographical fiction==
{{see also|Biographical novel|Biographical film}}
Biographical fiction is a type of [[historical fiction]] that takes a historical individual and recreates elements of his or her life, while telling a fictional narrative, usually in the genres of film or the novel. The relationship between the biographical and the fictional may vary within different pieces of biographical fiction. It frequently includes selective information and self-censoring of the past. The characters are often real people or based on real people, but the need for "truthful" representation is less strict than in [[biography]]. 

The various philosophies behind biographical fiction lead to different types of content. Some asserts itself as a factual narrative about the historical individual, like [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[Lincoln (novel)|Lincoln]]''. Other biographical fiction creates two parallel strands of narrative, one in the contemporary world and one focusing on the biographical history, such as [[Malcolm Bradbury]]'s ''[[To the Hermitage]]'' and [[Michael Cunningham]]'s ''[[The Hours (novel)|The Hours]]''. No matter what style of biographical fiction is used, the novelist usually starts the writing process with historical research.&lt;ref name="mullan" /&gt;

Biographical fiction has its roots in late 19th and early 20th-century novels based loosely on the lives of famous people,  but without direct reference to them, such as [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Diana of the Crossways]]'' (1885) and [[Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' (1919). During the early part of the 20th century this became a distinct genre, with novels that were explicitly about individuals' lives.&lt;ref name = mullan&gt;{{cite news| title = Heavy on the source John Mullan analyses The Master by Colm Tóibín.

==Autobiographical fiction==
{{main|Autofiction}}
{{see also|Autobiographical novel|Autobiographical comics}}
Autobiographical fiction, or autofiction, is fiction that incorporates the author's own experience into the narrative. It allows authors to both rely and reflect on their own experience. However, the reading of the autobiographical fiction need not always be associated with the author. Such books may be treated as distinct fictional works.&lt;ref name = bragg&gt;{{cite news| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5668638.ece| newspaper = The Sunday Times| date = 8 February 2009| title = Melvyn Bragg on autobiographical fiction| accessdate = 9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Literature}}

A '''book'''  is both a usually portable physical object and the body of immaterial representations or intellectual object whose material signs—written or drawn lines or other two-dimensional media—the physical object contains or houses. 

As a physical object, a book is a stack of usually rectangular [[page (paper)|pages]] (made of [[papyrus]], [[parchment]], [[vellum]], or [[paper]]) oriented with one side (either left or right, depending on the direction in which one reads a script) tied, sewn, or otherwise fixed together and then [[bookbinding|bound]] to the flexible spine of a protective [[book cover|cover]] of heavier, relatively inflexible material so that, when the opened front cover has received a massy enough stack of sheets, the book can lie flat.&lt;ref&gt;IEILS, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  The technical term for this physical arrangement is [[Codex|''codex'']] (in the plural, ''codices''). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its immediate predecessor, the [[scroll]].  

As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and a still considerable, though not so extensive, investment of time to read. This sense of book has a restricted and an unrestricted sense. In the restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage that reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls, and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. So, for instance, each part of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' is called a book, as of course the Bible encompasses many different books.  In the unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts.

But the intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, or can be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings, or photographs, or such things as crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls.  In a physical book the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines as support for on-going entries, i.e., an account book, an appointment book, a log book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or day book, or a sketch book.  Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album.  

Books may be distributed in electronic form as [[e-book]]s and other formats. In its "Revised Recommendation concerning the International Standardization of Statistics on the Production and Distribution of Books, Newspapers and Periodicals" of 1 November 1985, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) stated that it was "convinced that it is desirable that the national authorities responsible for collecting and reporting statistics relating to the production and distribution of printed publications should be guided by certain standards in the matter of definitions, classification and presentation," and so "in order to improve the international comparability of statistics," it defined a book as "a non-periodic publication of at least 49 pages exclusive of the cover pages, published in the country and made available to the public" (11(a)), so that books statistics could be collected on "(a) Government publications, i.e., publications issued by public administrations or their subsidiary bodies, except for those which are confidential or designed for internal distribution only; (b) School textbooks, books prescribed for pupils receiving education at the first and second level as defined in the revised Recommendation concerning the International Standardization of Educational Statistics adopted by the General Conference; (c) University theses; (d) Offprints, i.e., reprints of a part of a book or a periodical already published, provided that they have a title and a separate pagination and that they constitute a distinct work; (e) Publications which form part of a series, but which constitute separate bibliographical units; (f) Illustrated works: (i) Collections of prints, reproductions of works of art, drawings, etc., when such collections form complete, paginated volumes and when the illustrations are accompanied by an explanatory text, however short, referring to these works or to the artists themselves; (ii) Albums, illustrated books and pamphlets written in the form of continuous narratives, with pictures illustrating certain episodes; (iii) Albums and picture-books for children; (iv) Comic books" (9-10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13146&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Revised Recommendation concerning the International Standardization of Statistics on the Production and Distribution of Books, Newspapers and Periodicals: UNESCO|website=portal.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A single sheet in a codex  is a [[Recto|leaf]], and each side of a leaf is a [[page (paper)|page]].

Although in ordinary academic parlance a [[monograph]] is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a single scholarly subject, in [[library and information science]] ''monograph'' denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one [[Volume (bibliography)|volume]] (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume [[In Search of Lost Time|''In Search of Lost Time'']]), in contrast to serial publications like a [[magazine]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[newspaper]]. An avid reader or collector of books or a book lover is a [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] or colloquially, "bookworm". A shop where [[Bookselling|books are bought and sold]] is a [[bookshop]] or bookstore. Books are also sold elsewhere. Books can also be borrowed from [[Lending library|libraries]]. [[Google]] has estimated that as of 2010, approximately 130,000,000 distinct titles had been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2010/08/books-of-world-stand-up-and-be-counted.html |date=August 5, 2010 |title=Books of the world, stand up and be counted!

At least until Sunday. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the use of [[Ebooks|e-books]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curtis|first1=George|title=The Law of Cybercrimes and Their Investigations|date=2011|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; though sales of e-books declined in the first half of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/business/media/the-plot-twist-e-book-sales-slip-and-print-is-far-from-dead.html |date=September 22, 2015 |title=The Plot Twist: E-Book Sales Slip, and Print Is Far From Dead |accessdate=October 8, 2015 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word book comes from [[Old English]] "bōc", which in turn comes from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] root "*bōk-", [[cognate]] to "[[beech]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/book |title=Book |publisher=Dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see American Heritage Dictionary and Online Etymology Dictionary --&gt; Similarly, in [[Slavic languages]] (for example, [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]) "буква" (bukva—"letter") is cognate with "beech". In Russian and in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and Macedonian, the word "букварь" (bukvar') or "буквар" (bukvar) refers specifically to a primary school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing.
It is thus conjectured that the earliest [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] writings may have been carved on beech wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northvegr.org/holy/b.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103044850/http://www.northvegr.org/holy/b.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 3, 2008|title=Northvegr - Holy Language Lexicon|date=November 3, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Latin word ''codex'', meaning a book in the modern sense (bound and with separate leaves), originally meant "block of wood".

=== Antiquity ===

When [[History of writing|writing systems]] were created in [[ancient civilization]]s, a variety of objects, such as stone, [[clay tablet|clay]], tree bark, metal sheets, and bones, were used for writing; these are studied in [[epigraphy]].

==== Tablet ====
{{Main|Clay tablet|Wax tablet}}{{See also|Stylus}}

A tablet is a physically robust writing medium, suitable for casual transport and writing. [[Clay tablet]]s were flattened and mostly dry pieces of clay that could be easily carried, and impressed with a [[stylus]]. They were used as a writing medium, especially for writing in [[cuneiform]], throughout the [[Bronze Age]] and well into the [[Iron Age]]. [[Wax tablet]]s were pieces of wood covered in a thick enough coating of wax to record the impressions of a stylus. They were the normal writing material in schools, in accounting, and for taking notes. They had the advantage of being reusable: the wax could be melted, and reformed into a blank.

The custom of binding several wax tablets together (Roman ''pugillares'') is a possible precursor of modern bound (codex) books.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology of the word ''codex'' (block of wood) also suggests that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bischoff| first = Bernhard| others = Dáibhí ó Cróinin| title = Latin palaeography antiquity and the Middle Ages| url = https://books.google.com/?id=CFZgQgAACAAJ| year = 1990| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-0-521-36473-7| page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Scroll ====
{{main article|Scroll}}
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian papyrus showing the god [[Osiris]] and the weighing of the heart.]]
Scrolls can be made from [[papyrus]], a thick [[paper|paper-like]] material made by weaving the stems of the papyrus plant, then pounding the woven sheet with a hammer-like tool until it is flattened. Papyrus was used for writing in [[Ancient Egypt]], perhaps as early as the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], although the first evidence is from the account books of King [[Nefertiti Kakai]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty]] (about 2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papyrus sheets were glued together to form a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]]. Tree bark such as [[Tilia|lime]] and other materials were also used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dard Hunter]]. ''Papermaking: History and Technique of an Ancient Craft New ed.'' Dover Publications 1978, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herodotus]] (History 5:58), the [[Phoenicians]] brought writing and papyrus to Greece around the 10th or 9th century BC. The Greek word for papyrus as writing material (''biblion'') and book (''biblos'') come from the Phoenician port town [[Byblos]], through which papyrus was exported to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', pp. 144–45.&lt;/ref&gt; From Greek we also derive the word tome ({{lang-el|τόμος}}), which originally meant a slice or piece and from there began to denote "a roll of papyrus". ''Tomus'' was used by the Latins with exactly the same meaning as ''volumen'' (see also below the explanation by Isidore of Seville).

Whether made from papyrus, [[parchment]], or paper, scrolls were the dominant form of book in the Hellenistic, Roman, Chinese, Hebrew, and Macedonian cultures. The more modern [[codex]] book format form took over the Roman world by [[late antiquity]], but the scroll format persisted much longer in Asia.

==== Codex ====
[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A Chinese [[bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo book]] meets the modern definition of Codex]]
{{main article|Codex}}
[[Isidore of Seville]] (d. 636) explained the then-current relation between codex, book and scroll in his Etymologiae (VI.13): "A codex is composed of many books; a book is of one scroll. It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (''codex'') of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches." Modern usage differs.

A codex (in modern usage) is the first information repository that modern people would recognize as a "book": leaves of uniform size [[bookbinding|bound]] in some manner along one edge, and typically held between two [[book cover|covers]] made of some more robust material. The first written mention of the codex as a form of book is from [[Martial]], in his Apophoreta &lt;small&gt;CLXXXIV&lt;/small&gt; at the end of the first century, where he praises its compactness. However, the codex never gained much popularity in the pagan Hellenistic world, and only within the Christian community did it gain widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature. Edd. Frances Young, Lewis Ayres, Andrew Louth, Ron White. Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; This change happened gradually during the 3rd and 4th centuries, and the reasons for adopting the codex form of the book are several: the format is more economical, as both sides of the writing material can be used; and it is portable, searchable, and easy to conceal. A book is much easier to read, to find a page that you want, and to flip through. A scroll is more awkward to use. The Christian [[author]]s may also have wanted to distinguish their writings from the pagan and Judaic texts written on scrolls. In addition, some metal books were made, that required smaller pages of metal, instead of an impossibly long, unbending scroll of metal. A book can also be easily stored in more compact places, or side by side in a tight library or shelf space.

==== Manuscripts ====
{{main article|Manuscript}}
[[File:RomanVirgilFolio014rVergilPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|Folio 14 recto of the 5th century [[Vergilius Romanus]] contains an author portrait of [[Virgil]]. Note the [[bookcase]] (''capsa''), reading stand and the text written without word spacing in [[rustic capitals]].]]

The fall of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 5th century AD saw the decline of the [[culture of ancient Rome]]. Papyrus became difficult to obtain due to lack of contact with Egypt, and parchment, which had been used for centuries, became the main writing material. Parchment is a material made from processed animal skin and used—mainly in the past—for writing on.
Parchment is most commonly made of calfskin, sheepskin, or goatskin. It was historically used for writing documents, notes, or the pages of a book. Parchment is limed, scraped and dried under tension. It is not tanned, and is thus different from leather. This makes it more suitable for writing on, but leaves it very reactive to changes in relative humidity and makes it revert to rawhide if overly wet.

Monasteries carried on the [[Latin literature|Latin]] writing tradition in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. [[Cassiodorus]], in the monastery of Vivarium (established around 540), stressed the importance of copying texts.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', pp. 207–08.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict of Nursia]], in his ''[[Rule of Saint Benedict]]'' (completed around the middle of the 6th century) later also promoted reading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Maynard]]. ''Saint Benedict and His Monks''. Staples Press Ltd 1956, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rule of Saint Benedict'' (Ch. &lt;small&gt;XLVIII&lt;/small&gt;), which set aside certain times for reading, greatly influenced the monastic culture of the [[Middle Ages]] and is one of the reasons why the clergy were the predominant readers of books. The tradition and style of the Roman Empire still dominated, but slowly the peculiar medieval book culture emerged.

[[File:CodxAmiatinusFolio5rEzra.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Codex Amiatinus]] anachronistically depicts the Biblical [[Ezra]] with the kind of books used in the 8th Century AD.]]
Before the invention and adoption of the [[printing press]], almost all books were copied by hand, which made books expensive and comparatively rare. Smaller monasteries usually had only a few dozen books, medium-sized perhaps a few hundred. By the 9th century, larger collections held around 500 volumes and even at the end of the Middle Ages, the papal library in [[Avignon]] and Paris library of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] held only around 2,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Martin D. Joachim. Historical Aspects of Cataloguing and Classification. Haworth Press 2003, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[scriptorium]]'' of the monastery was usually located over the [[chapter house]]. Artificial light was forbidden for fear it may damage the manuscripts. There were five types of scribes:
* '''Calligraphers''', who dealt in fine book production
* '''Copyists''', who dealt with basic production and correspondence
* '''Correctors''', who collated and compared a finished book with the manuscript from which it had been produced
* '''Illuminators''', who painted illustrations
* '''Rubricators''', who painted in the red letters

The bookmaking process was long and laborious. The parchment had to be prepared, then the unbound pages were planned and ruled with a blunt tool or lead, after which the text was written by the [[scribe]], who usually left blank areas for illustration and [[rubrication]]. Finally, the book was bound by the [[bookbinding|bookbinder]].&lt;ref&gt;Edith Diehl. ''Bookbinding: Its Background and Technique''. Dover Publications 1980, pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of ink were known in antiquity, usually prepared from soot and gum, and later also from [[gall]] nuts and [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron vitriol]]. This gave writing a brownish black color, but black or brown were not the only colors used. There are texts written in red or even gold, and different colors were used for illumination. For very luxurious manuscripts the whole parchment [[Purple parchment|was colored purple]], and the text was written on it with gold or silver (for example, [[Codex Argenteus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish monks introduced spacing between words in the 7th century. This facilitated reading, as these monks tended to be less familiar with Latin. However, the use of spaces between words did not become commonplace before the 12th century. It has been argued that the use of spacing between words shows the transition from semi-vocalized reading into silent reading.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Saenger. ''Space Between Words: The Origins of Silent Reading''. Stanford University Press 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first books used [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] ([[calfskin]]) for the pages. The book covers were made of wood and covered with leather. Because dried parchment tends to assume the form it had before processing, the books were fitted with clasps or straps. During the later [[Middle Ages]], when public libraries appeared, up to the 18th century, books were often chained to a bookshelf or a [[desk]] to prevent theft. These chained books are called ''libri catenati''.

At first, books were copied mostly in monasteries, one at a time. With the rise of universities in the 13th century, the [[Manuscript culture]] of the time led to an increase in the demand for books, and a new system for copying books appeared. The books were divided into unbound leaves (''pecia''), which were lent out to different copyists, so the speed of book production was considerably increased. The system was maintained by secular [[stationery|stationers]] guilds, which produced both religious and non-religious material.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography'', pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] has kept the art of the scribe alive up to the present. According to Jewish tradition, the [[Torah]] scroll placed in a [[synagogue]] must be written by hand on parchment and a printed book would not do, though the congregation may use printed prayer books and printed copies of the Scriptures are used for study outside the [[synagogue]]. A [[sofer]] "scribe" is a highly respected member of any observant Jewish community.

==== Middle East ====
{{Cite check|section|date=September 2010}}
People of various religious (Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, Muslims) and ethnic backgrounds (Syriac, Coptic, Persian, Arab etc.) in the Middle East also produced and bound books in the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (mid 8th century to 1258), developing advanced techniques in [[Islamic calligraphy]], [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and bookbinding. A number of cities in the medieval Islamic world had book production centers and book markets. Yaqubi (d. 897) says that in his time Baghdad had over a hundred booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;W. Durant, "The Age of Faith", New York 1950, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Book shops were often situated around the town's principal mosque &lt;ref&gt;S.E. Al-Djazairi "The Golden Age of Islamic Civilization", Manchester 2996, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]], that has a street named ''Kutubiyyin'' or book sellers in English and the famous [[Koutoubia Mosque]] is named so because of its location in this street.

The medieval [[Muslim world]] also used a method of reproducing reliable copies of a book in large quantities known as [[Proofreading|check reading]], in contrast to the traditional method of a single scribe producing only a single copy of a single manuscript. In the check reading method, only "authors could authorize copies, and this was done in public sessions in which the copyist read the copy aloud in the presence of the author, who then certified it as accurate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165–86 [43]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this check-reading system, "an author might produce a dozen or more copies from a single reading," and with two or more readings, "more than one hundred copies of a single book could easily be produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165–86 [44]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using as writing material the relatively cheap paper instead of parchment or papyrus the Muslims, in the words of Pedersen "accomplished a feat of crucial significance not only to the history of the Islamic book, but also to the whole world of books".&lt;ref&gt;Johs. Pedersen, "The Arabic Book", Princeton University Press, 1984, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wood block printing ====

[[File:Traditional_Bagh_hand_block_print_master_craftsman-artisan-artist_Mohammed_Bilal_Khatri,_Madhya_Pradesh,_India.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bagh Print]] Traditional woodblock printing in [[Bagh, Dhar|Bagh]] [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]].]]
In [[woodblock printing]], a relief image of an entire page was carved into blocks of wood, inked, and used to print copies of that page. This method originated in China, in the [[Han dynasty]] (before 220 AD), as a method of [[printing]] on [[textiles]] and later [[paper]], and was widely used throughout [[East Asia]]. The oldest dated book printed by this method is ''[[The Diamond Sutra]]'' (868 AD).The method (called ''[[Woodcut]]'' when used in art) arrived in Europe in the early 14th century. Books (known as [[Woodblock printing|block-books]]), as well as [[playing-cards]] and [[old master print|religious pictures]], began to be produced by this method. Creating an entire book was a painstaking process, requiring a hand-carved block for each page; and the wood blocks tended to crack, if stored for long. The monks or people who wrote them were paid highly.

==== Movable type and incunabula ====
[[File:Bucheinband.15.Jh.r.Inkunabel.jpg|thumb|upright|A 15th-century [[Incunable]]. Notice the blind-tooled cover, corner bosses and clasps.]]
{{main article|Movable type|Incunable}}
[[File:SelectedTeachingsofBuddhistSagesandSonMasters1377.jpg|thumb|left|''Selected Teachings of Buddhist Sages and Son Masters'', the earliest known book printed with movable metal type, 1377. [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].]]

The Chinese inventor [[Bi Sheng]] made [[movable type]] of earthenware c. 1045, but there are no known surviving examples of his printing. Around 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]]. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce, and more widely available.

Early printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as [[incunable]]s or ''incunabula''. "A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in AD 330."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Clapham (industrialist)|Clapham, Michael]], "Printing" in ''A History of Technology'', Vol 2. ''From the Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution'', edd. Charles Singer ''et al.'' (Oxford 1957), p. 377. Cited from [[Elizabeth L. Eisenstein]], ''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change'' (Cambridge University, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century to 21st centuries===
Steam-powered printing presses became popular in the early 19th century. These machines could print 1,100 sheets per hour, but workers could only set 2,000 letters per hour.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[Monotype]] and [[linotype machine|linotype]] typesetting machines were introduced in the late 19th century. They could set more than 6,000 letters per hour and an entire line of type at once. There have been numerous improvements in the printing press. As well, the conditions for [[freedom of the press]] have been improved through the gradual relaxation of restrictive censorship laws. See also [[intellectual property]], [[public domain]], [[copyright]]. In mid-20th century, European book production had risen to over 200,000 titles per year.

Throughout the 20th century, libraries have faced an ever-increasing rate of publishing, sometimes called an [[information explosion]]. The advent of [[electronic publishing]] and the [[internet]] means that much new information is not printed in paper books, but is made available online through a [[digital library]], on [[CD-ROM]], in the form of e-books or other online media. An [[on-line book]] is an e-book that is available online through the internet. Though many books are produced digitally, most digital versions are not available to the public, and there is no decline in the rate of paper publishing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bowker.com/index.php/press-releases/616-bowker-reports-traditional-us-book-production-flat-in-2009 Bowker Reports Traditional U.S. Book Production Flat in 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128205430/http://www.bowker.com/index.php/press-releases/616-bowker-reports-traditional-us-book-production-flat-in-2009 |date=January 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an effort, however, to convert books that are in the [[public domain]] into a digital medium for unlimited redistribution and infinite availability. This effort is spearheaded by [[Project Gutenberg]] combined with [[Distributed Proofreaders]]. There have also been new developments in the process of publishing books. Technologies such as POD or "[[print on demand]]", which make it possible to print as few as one book at a time, have made self-publishing (and [[vanity publishing]]) much easier and more affordable. On-demand publishing has allowed publishers, by avoiding the high costs of warehousing, to keep low-selling books in print rather than declaring them out of print.

[[File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits (2).jpg|thumb|The [[Bookbinding|spine]] of the book is an important aspect in [[book design]], especially in the cover design. When the books are stacked up or stored in a shelf, the details on the spine is the only visible surface that contains the information about the book. In stores, it is the details on the spine that attract buyers' attention first.]]

The methods used for the printing and binding of books continued fundamentally unchanged from the 15th century into the early 20th century. While there was more [[mechanization]], a [[book printer]] in 1900 had much in common with [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]. [[Printing press|Gutenberg's invention]] was the use of movable metal types, assembled into words, lines, and pages and then printed by [[letterpress]] to create multiple copies. Modern paper books are printed on [[Printing and writing paper|papers]] designed specifically for printed books. Traditionally, book papers are off-white or low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to minimise the show-through of text from one side of the page to the other and are (usually) made to tighter [[caliper]] or thickness specifications, particularly for case-bound books. Different paper qualities are used depending on the type of book: [[Machine finished coated paper]]s, [[woodfree uncoated paper]]s, [[coated fine paper]]s and [[special fine paper]]s are common paper grades.

Today, the majority of books are printed by [[offset lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BNCODAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=Today,+the+majority+of+books+are+printed+by+offset+lithography#v=onepage&amp;q=Today,%20the%20majority%20of%20books%20are%20printed%20by%20offset%20lithography&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Canadian Book Editor|last=Vermeer|first=Leslie|date=2016-08-31|publisher=Brush Education|isbn=9781550596779|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a book is printed, the pages are laid out on the plate so that after the printed sheet is folded the pages will be in the correct sequence. Books tend to be manufactured nowadays in a few standard sizes. The [[Book size|sizes of books]] are usually specified as "trim size": the size of the page after the sheet has been folded and trimmed. The standard sizes result from sheet sizes (therefore machine sizes) which became popular 200 or 300 years ago, and have come to dominate the industry. British conventions in this regard prevail throughout the English-speaking world, except for the USA. The European book manufacturing industry works to a completely different set of standards.

===Processes===

====Layout====
Modern bound books are organized according to a particular format called the book's ''layout''.  Although there is great variation in layout, modern books tend to adhere to as set of rules with regard to what the parts of the layout are and what their content usually includes.  A basic layout will include a ''front cover'', a ''back cover'', and the book's content which is called its ''body copy'' or ''content pages''.  The front cover often bears the book's title (and subtitle, if any) and the name of its author or editor(s).  The ''inside front cover'' page is usually left blank in both hardcover and paperback books.  The next section, if present, is the book's ''front matter'', which includes all textual material after the front cover but not part of the book's content— such things as a forward, a dedication, and a table of contents as well as publisher data such as the book's edition or printing number and place of publication.  Between the body copy and the back cover goes the ''end matter'' which would include any indices, sets of tables, or diagrams, glossaries, or lists of cited works (though an edited book with multiple contributing authors usually places cited works at the end of each authored chapter).   The ''inside back cover'' page, like that inside the front cover, is usually blank.  The ''back cover'' itself is the usual place for the book's [[ISBN]], and maybe a photograph of the author(s)/ editor(s), perhaps with a short introduction to them.  Also here often appear plot summaries, barcodes, and excerpted reviews of the book.&lt;ref name="ShellyStarks2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary B. Shelly|author2=Joy L. Starks|title=Microsoft Publisher 2010: Comprehensive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSQJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA559|date=6 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-17147-8|page=559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Printing====
[[File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits.jpg|thumb|Book covers]]
Some books, particularly those with shorter runs (i.e. fewer copies) will be printed on sheet-fed offset presses, but most books are now printed on web presses, which are fed by a continuous roll of paper, and can consequently print more copies in a shorter time. As the production line circulates, a complete "book" is collected together in one stack, next to another, and another A [[web press]] carries out the folding itself, delivering bundles of ''signatures'' (sections) ready to go into the gathering line. Note that the pages of a book are printed two at a time, not as one complete book. Excess numbers are printed to make up for any spoilage due to make-readies or test pages to assure final print quality.

A ''make-ready'' is the preparatory work carried out by the pressmen to get the printing press up to the required quality of [[Impression (publishing)|impression]]. Included in make-ready is the time taken to mount the plate onto the machine, clean up any mess from the previous job, and get the press up to speed. As soon as the pressman decides that the printing is correct, all the make-ready sheets will be discarded, and the press will start making books. Similar make readies take place in the folding and binding areas, each involving spoilage of paper.

====Binding====
After the signatures are folded and gathered, they move into the [[bindery]]. In the middle of last century there were still many trade binders – stand-alone binding companies which did no printing, specializing in binding alone. At that time, because of the dominance of letterpress printing, typesetting and printing took place in one location, and binding in a different factory. When type was all metal, a typical book's worth of type would be bulky, fragile and heavy. The less it was moved in this condition the better: so printing would be carried out in the same location as the typesetting. Printed sheets on the other hand could easily be moved. Now, because of increasing [[Automation|computerization]] of preparing a book for the printer, the typesetting part of the job has flowed upstream, where it is done either by separately contracting companies working for the publisher, by the publishers themselves, or even by the authors. Mergers in the book manufacturing industry mean that it is now unusual to find a bindery which is not also involved in book printing (and vice versa).

If the book is a [[hardcover|hardback]] its path through the bindery will involve more points of activity than if it is a [[paperback]]. Unsewn binding, is now increasingly common. The signatures of a book can also be held together by "Smyth sewing" using needles, "McCain sewing", using drilled holes often used in schoolbook binding, or "notch binding", where gashes about an inch long are made at intervals through the fold in the spine of each signature. The rest of the binding process is similar in all instances. Sewn and notch bound books can be bound as either hardbacks or paperbacks.

===Finishing===
[[File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits (3).jpg|thumb|Book pages]]
"Making cases" happens off-line and prior to the book's arrival at the binding line. In the most basic case-making, two pieces of cardboard are placed onto a glued piece of cloth with a space between them into which is glued a thinner board cut to the width of the spine of the book. The overlapping edges of the cloth (about 5/8" all round) are folded over the boards, and pressed down to adhere. After case-making the stack of cases will go to the [[foil stamping]] area for adding decorations and type.

==Digital printing==
Recent developments in book manufacturing include the development of digital printing. Book pages are printed, in much the same way as an office copier works, using [[toner]] rather than ink. Each book is printed in one pass, not as separate signatures. Digital printing has permitted the manufacture of much smaller quantities than offset, in part because of the absence of make readies and of spoilage. One might think of a web press as printing quantities over 2000, quantities from 250 to 2000 being printed on sheet-fed presses, and digital presses doing quantities below 250. These numbers are of course only approximate and will vary from supplier to supplier, and from book to book depending on its characteristics. Digital printing has opened up the possibility of print-on-demand, where no books are printed until after an order is received from a customer.

=== E-book ===
{{main article|e-book}}
[[File:Amazon Kindle 3.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A screen of a [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] e-reader.]]
In the 2000s, due to the rise in availability of affordable handheld computing devices, the opportunity to share texts through electronic means became an appealing option for media publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libraries.pewinternet.org/2012/04/04/the-rise-of-e-reading/|title=The rise of e-reading|last=Rainie|first=Lee|last2=Zickuhr|first2=Kathryn|date=2012-04-04|website=Pew Internet Libraries|access-date=2017-02-02|last3=Purcell|first3=Kristen|last4=Madden|first4=Mary|last5=Brenner|first5=Joanna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "e-book" was made. The term e-book is a contraction of "electronic book"; it refers to a book-length publication in digital form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.builderbill-diy-help.com/what-is-an-ebook.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722033703/http://www.builderbill-diy-help.com/what-is-an-ebook.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 22, 2012|title=What is an e-book|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An e-book is usually made available through the internet, but also on CD-ROM and other forms. E-Books may be read either via a computing device with an LED display such as a traditional [[computer]], a [[smartphone]] or a [[tablet computer]]; or by means of a portable e-ink display device known as an e-book reader, such as the [[Sony Reader]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble Nook]], [[Kobo eReader]], or the [[Amazon Kindle]]. E-book readers attempt to mimic the experience of reading a print book by using this technology, since the displays on e-book readers are much less reflective.

== Design ==
{{main article|Book design}}

Book design is the art of incorporating the content, style, format, design, and sequence of the various components of a book into a coherent whole. In the words of Jan Tschichold, book design "though largely forgotten today, methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve have been developed over centuries. To produce perfect books these rules have to be brought back to life and applied." Richard Hendel describes book design as "an arcane subject" and refers to the need for a context to understand what that means. Many different creators can contribute to book design, including [[graphic design]]ers, [[artist]]s and editors.

== Sizes ==
{{main article|Book size}}
[[File:Codex Gigas facsimile.jpg|thumb|Real-size [[facsimile]] of [[Codex Gigas]]]]
[[File:Kyauksa.JPG|thumb|A page from the [[world's largest book]]. Each page is three and a half feet wide, five feet tall and a little over five inches thick]]
The size of a modern book is based on the printing area of a common flatbed press. The pages of type were arranged and clamped in a frame, so that when printed on a sheet of paper the full size of the press, the pages would be right side up and in order when the sheet was folded, and the folded edges trimmed.

The most common book sizes are:
* Quarto (4to): the sheet of paper is folded twice, forming four leaves (eight pages) approximately 11–13&amp;nbsp;inches (c. 30&amp;nbsp;cm) tall
* Octavo (8vo): the most common size for current hardcover books. The sheet is folded three times into eight leaves (16 pages) up to 9 ¾" (c. 23 cm) tall.
* DuoDecimo (12mo): a size between 8vo and 16mo, up to 7 ¾" (c. 18&amp;nbsp;cm) tall
* Sextodecimo (16mo): the sheet is folded four times, forming 16 leaves (32 pages) up to 6 ¾" (c. 15 cm) tall

Sizes smaller than 16mo are:
* 24mo: up to 5 ¾" (c. 13&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* 32mo: up to 5" (c. 12&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* 48mo: up to 4" (c. 10&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* 64mo: up to 3" (c. 8&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.

Small books can be called ''booklets''.

Sizes larger than quarto are:
* Folio: up to 15" (c. 38&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* Elephant Folio: up to 23" (c. 58&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* Atlas Folio: up to 25" (c. 63&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* Double Elephant Folio: up to 50" (c. 127&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.

The largest extant medieval manuscript in the world is [[Codex Gigas]] 92 × 50 × 22&amp;nbsp;cm. The [[world's largest book]] is made of stone and is in [[Kuthodaw Pagoda]] ([[Burma]]).

== Types ==

=== By content ===
[[File:Polish sci fi fantasy books.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Novel]]s in a [[bookstore]]]]
A common separation by content are [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]] books. This simple separation can be found in most [[collection (museum)|collections]], [[library|libraries]], and [[bookstore]]s.

==== Fiction ====
Many of the books published today are fiction, meaning that they are in-part or completely untrue. Historically, paper production was considered too expensive to be used for [[entertainment]]. An increase in global [[literacy]] and [[printing|print]] technology led to the increased publication of books for the purpose of entertainment, and allegorical [[social commentary]]. Most fiction is additionally categorized by [[genre]].

The '''[[novel]]''' is the most common form of fiction book. Novels are stories that typically feature a [[plot (narrative)|plot]], [[setting (fiction)|setting]], [[theme (literature)|themes]] and [[character (arts)|characters]]. Stories and narrative are not restricted to any topic; a novel can be whimsical, serious or [[controversy|controversial]]. The novel has had a tremendous impact on entertainment and [[publishing]] [[Market (economics)|markets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Media Business; Publishers Worry After Fiction Sales Weaken |author=Edwin Mcdowell |date=October 30, 1989 |work=New York Times | id = |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/30/business/the-media-business-publishers-worry-after-fiction-sales-weaken.html |accessdate =January 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[novella]] is a term sometimes used for fiction [[prose]] typically between 17,500 and 40,000 words, and a [[Novella|novelette]] between 7,500 and 17,500. A [[short story]] may be any length up to 10,000 words, but these word lengths vary.

'''[[Comic book]]s''' or '''[[graphic novel]]s''' are books in which the story is illustrated. The characters and narrators use speech or thought bubbles to express verbal language.

==== Non-fiction ====
[[File:Stefan Ramult-Pomeranian Dictionary.png|upright|thumb|left|A page from a [[dictionary]]]]
In a library, a [[reference book]] is a general type of non-fiction book which provides information as opposed to telling a story, essay, commentary, or otherwise supporting a point of view. An [[almanac]] is a very general reference book, usually one-volume, with lists of data and information on many topics. An [[encyclopedia]] is a book or set of books designed to have more in-depth articles on many topics. A book listing [[word]]s, their [[etymology]], meanings, and other information is called a [[dictionary]]. A book which is a collection of [[map]]s is an [[atlas]]. A more specific reference book with tables or lists of data and information about a certain topic, often intended for professional use, is often called a [[handbook]]. Books which try to list references and abstracts in a certain broad area may be called an [[index (publishing)|index]], such as ''Engineering Index'', or [[abstract (summary)|abstracts]] such as chemical abstracts and biological abstracts.
[[File:Atlas - book.jpg|right|thumb|An [[atlas]]]]

Books with technical information on how to do something or how to use some equipment are called [[instruction manual]]s. Other popular [[how-to]] books include [[cookbook]]s and [[home improvement]] books.

Students typically store and carry [[textbook]]s and [[schoolbooks]] for study purposes. [[Elementary school]] pupils often use [[workbook]]s, which are published with spaces or blanks to be filled by them for study or [[homework]]. In US [[higher education]], it is common for a student to take an exam using a [[blue book exam|blue book]].

[[File:Friedrich Kellner diary Oct 6, 1939 p3.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A page from a [[notebook]] used as hand written [[diary]]]]

There is a large set of books that are made only to write private ideas, notes, and accounts. These books are rarely published and are typically destroyed or remain private. [[Notebook]]s are blank papers to be written in by the user. [[Student]]s and [[writer]]s commonly use them for taking notes. [[Scientist]]s and other researchers use [[lab notebook]]s to record their notes. They often feature spiral coil bindings at the edge so that pages may easily be torn out.

[[File:MichYellowBooks.JPG|thumb|A [[telephone directory]], with business and residence listings.]]

[[Address book]]s, [[phone book]]s, and [[meeting|calendar/appointment]] books are commonly used on a daily basis for recording appointments, meetings and personal [[Address (geography)|contact information]].

Books for recording periodic entries by the user, such as daily information about a journey, are called [[logbook]]s or simply logs. A similar book for writing the owner's daily private personal events, information, and ideas is called a [[diary]] or [[personal journal]].

[[Business]]es use [[accounting]] books such as journals and [[ledger]]s to record financial data in a practice called [[bookkeeping]].

==== Other types ====
There are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system. [[photograph album|Albums]] are books for holding a group of items belonging to a particular theme, such as a set of [[photograph]]s, card collections, and memorabilia. One common example is [[stamp album]]s, which are used by many hobbyists to protect and organize their collections of [[postage stamps]]. Such albums are often made using removable plastic pages held inside in a ringed binder or other similar holder. Picture books are books for children with pictures on every page and less text (or even no text).

[[Hymnal]]s are books with collections of [[music]]al [[hymn]]s that can typically be found in [[church (building)|churches]]. [[Breviary|Prayerbooks]] or [[missal]]s are books that contain written [[prayer]]s and are commonly carried by [[monk]]s, [[nun]]s, and other devoted followers or [[clergy]].

===Decodable readers and leveled books===
A leveled book collection is a set of books organized in levels of difficulty from the easy books appropriate for an emergent reader to longer more complex books adequate for advanced readers.  Decodable readers or books are a specialized type of leveled books that use decodable text only including controlled lists of words, sentences and stories consistent with the letters and phonics that have been taught to the emergent reader.  New sounds and letters are added to higher level decodable books, as the level of instruction progresses, allowing for higher levels of accuracy, comprehension and fluency.

=== By physical format ===
[[File:Latin dictionary.jpg|thumb|[[Hardcover]] books]]
[[File:Borders bookshelf.jpg|thumb|[[Paperback]] books]]

[[Hardcover]] books have a stiff binding. [[Paperback]] books have cheaper, flexible covers which tend to be less durable. An alternative to paperback is the glossy cover, otherwise known as a dust cover, found on magazines, and comic books. Spiral-bound books are bound by spirals made of metal or plastic. Examples of spiral-bound books include teachers' manuals and [[puzzle book]]s ([[crossword]]s, [[sudoku]]).

[[Publishing]] is a process for producing pre-printed books, [[magazines]], and newspapers for the reader/user to buy.

Publishers may produce low-cost, pre-publication copies known as [[galley proof|galleys]] or 'bound proofs' for promotional purposes, such as generating reviews in advance of publication. Galleys are usually made as cheaply as possible, since they are not intended for sale.

== Libraries ==
{{main article|Library}}
[[File:Celsus-Bibliothek2.jpg|thumb|[[Celsus Library]] was built in 135 AD and could house around 12,000 scrolls.]]
Private or personal libraries made up of non-fiction and fiction books, (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in [[archive]]s) first appeared in [[classical Greece]]. In the ancient world, the maintaining of a [[library]] was usually (but not exclusively) the privilege of a wealthy individual. These libraries could have been either private or public, i.e. for people who were interested in using them. The difference from a modern [[public library]] lies in the fact that they were usually not funded from public sources. It is estimated that in the city of Rome at the end of the 3rd century there were around 30 public libraries. Public libraries also existed in other cities of the ancient [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean region]] (for example, [[Library of Alexandria]]).&lt;ref&gt;Miriam A. Drake, ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science'' (Marcel Dekker, 2003), "Public Libraries, History".&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the Middle Ages, monasteries and universities had also libraries that could be accessible to general public. Typically not the whole collection was available to public, the books could not be borrowed and often were chained to reading stands to prevent theft.

The beginning of modern public library begins around 15th century when individuals started to donate books to towns.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam A. Drake, ''Encyclopedia of Library'', "Public Libraries, History".&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of a [[public library]] system in the United States started in the late 19th century and was much helped by donations from [[Andrew Carnegie]]. This reflected classes in a society: The poor or the middle class had to access most books through a public library or by other means while the rich could afford to have a [[private library]] built in their homes. In the United States the Boston Public Library 1852 ''Report of the Trustees'' established the justification for the public library as a tax-supported institution intended to extend educational opportunity and provide for general culture.&lt;ref&gt;McCook, Kathleen de la Peña (2011), ''Introduction to Public Librarianship'', 2nd ed., p. 23 New York, Neal-Schuman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[paperback]] books in the 20th century led to an explosion of popular publishing. Paperback books made owning books affordable for many people. Paperback books often included works from genres that had previously been published mostly in [[pulp magazines]]. As a result of the low cost of such books and the spread of bookstores filled with them (in addition to the creation of a smaller market of extremely cheap used paperbacks) owning a private library ceased to be a status symbol for the rich.

In library and booksellers' catalogues, it is common to include an abbreviation such as "Crown 8vo" to indicate the [[paper size]] from which the book is made.

When rows of books are lined on a book holder, [[bookend]]s are sometimes needed to keep them from slanting.

== Identification and classification ==
[[File:ISBN.JPG|thumb|left|[[ISBN]] with [[barcode]]]]

During the 20th century, [[librarian]]s were concerned about keeping track of the many books being added yearly to the [[Gutenberg Galaxy]]. Through a global society called the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), they devised a series of tools including the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]] (ISBD). Each book is specified by an International Standard Book Number, or ISBN, which is unique to every edition of every book produced by participating publishers, worldwide. It is managed by the ISBN Society. An ISBN has four parts: the first part is the country code, the second the [[publisher]] code, and the third the title code. The last part is a [[check digit]], and can take values from 0–9 and X (10). The [[European Article Number|EAN]] [[Barcode]]s numbers for books are derived from the ISBN by prefixing 978, for [[Bookland]], and calculating a new check digit.

Commercial publishers in industrialized countries generally assign ISBNs to their books, so buyers may presume that the ISBN is part of a total international system, with no exceptions. However, many government publishers, in industrial as well as developing countries, do not participate fully in the ISBN system, and publish books which do not have ISBNs. A large or public collection requires a [[Library catalog|catalogue]]. Codes called "call numbers" relate the books to the catalogue, and determine their locations on the shelves. Call numbers are based on a [[Library classification]] system. The call number is placed on the spine of the book, normally a short distance before the bottom, and inside. Institutional or national standards, such as [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]/[[NISO]] Z39.41 - 1997, establish the correct way to place information (such as the [[title (publishing)|title]], or the name of the author) on book spines, and on "shelvable" book-like objects, such as containers for [[DVD]]s, [[video tape]]s and [[software]].
[[File:Wien - Volkskundemuseum-Bibliothek, Bücherspeicher.JPG|thumb|Books on library shelves and call numbers visible on the spines]]

One of the earliest and most widely known systems of cataloguing books is the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]]. Another widely known system is the [[Library of Congress Classification]] system. Both systems are biased towards subjects which were well represented in US libraries when they were developed, and hence have problems handling new subjects, such as computing, or subjects relating to other cultures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Information about books and authors can be stored in databases like [[online general-interest book database]]s. [[Metadata]], which means "data about data" is information about a book. Metadata about a book may include its title, ISBN or other classification number (see above), the names of contributors (author, editor, illustrator) and publisher, its date and size, the language of the text, its subject matter, etc.

=== Classification systems ===
* [[Bliss bibliographic classification]] (BC)
* [[Chinese Library Classification]] (CLC)
* [[Colon Classification]]
* [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC)
* [[Harvard-Yenching Classification]]
* [[Library of Congress Classification]] (LCC)
* [[New Classification Scheme for Chinese Libraries]]
* [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC)

== Uses ==
Aside from the primary purpose of reading them, books are also used for other ends:
* A book can be an artistic artifact, a piece of art; this is sometimes known as an [[artists' book]].
* A book may be evaluated by a reader or professional writer to create a [[book review]].
* A book may be read by a group of people to use as a spark for social or academic discussion, as in a [[book discussion club|book club]].
* A book may be studied by students as the subject of a writing and analysis exercise in the form of a [[book report]].
* Books are sometimes used for their exterior appearance to [[decorative arts|decorate]] a room, such as a [[study (room)|study]].

== Book marketing ==
Once the book is published, it is put on the market by the distributors and the bookstores. Meanwhile, his promotion comes from various media reports. Book marketing is governed by the law in many states.

=== Other forms of secondary spread ===
In recent years, the book had a second life in the form of reading aloud. This is called public readings of published works, with the assistance of professional readers (often known actors) and in close collaboration with writers, publishers, booksellers, librarians, leaders of the literary world and artists.

Many individual or collective practices exist to increase the number of readers of a book. Among them:
* abandonment of books in public places, coupled or not with the use of the Internet, known as the [[bookcrossing]];
* provision of free books in third places like bars or cafes;
* itinerant or temporary libraries;
* free public libraries in the area.

=== Evolution of the book industry ===
This form of the book chain has hardly changed since the eighteenth century, and has not always been this way. Thus, the author has asserted gradually with time, and the copyright dates only from the nineteenth century. For many centuries, especially before the invention of printing, each freely copied out books that passed through his hands, adding if necessary his own comments. Similarly, bookseller and publisher jobs have emerged with the invention of printing, which made the book an industrial product, requiring structures of production and marketing.

The invention of the Internet, e-readers, tablets, and projects like Wikipedia and Gutenberg, are likely to strongly change the book industry in the years to come.

== Paper and conservation ==
{{main article|Conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera}}
[[File:La fille du Cid - Upper and lower cover and spine (c151e11).jpg|thumb|Halfbound book with [[leather]] and [[marbled paper]].]]

Paper was first made in China as early as 200 BC, and reached Europe through [[History of Islam|Muslim]] territories. At first made of rags, the [[industrial revolution]] changed paper-making practices, allowing for paper to be made out of wood pulp. Papermaking in Europe began in the 11th century, although [[vellum]] was also common there as page material up until the beginning of the 16th century, vellum being the more expensive and durable option. Printers or publishers would often issue the same publication on both materials, to cater to more than one market.

Paper made from [[wood pulp]] became popular in the early 20th century, because it was cheaper than [[linen]] or [[abaca]] cloth-based papers. Pulp-based paper made books less expensive to the general public. This paved the way for huge leaps in the rate of literacy in industrialised nations, and enabled the spread of information during the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].

Pulp paper, however, contains acid which eventually destroys the paper from within. Earlier techniques for making paper used [[limestone]] rollers, which neutralized the acid in the pulp. Books printed between 1850 and 1950 are primarily at risk; more recent books are often printed on acid-free or [[alkaline]] paper. Libraries today have to consider [[mass deacidification]] of their older collections in order to prevent decay.

Stability of the climate is critical to the long-term preservation of paper and book material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Patkus | first = Beth| publication-date = 2003 | title = Assessing Preservation Needs, A Self-Survey Guide | publication-place = Andover| publisher =Northeast Document Conservation Center | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Good air circulation is important to keep fluctuation in climate stable. The [[HVAC]] system should be up to date and functioning efficiently. Light is detrimental to collections. Therefore, care should be given to the collections by implementing light control. General housekeeping issues can be addressed, including [[pest control]]. In addition to these helpful solutions, a library must also make an effort to be prepared if a disaster occurs, one that they cannot control. Time and effort should be given to create a concise and effective disaster plan to counteract any damage incurred through "acts of God" therefore an [[emergency management]] plan should be in place.

[[Image:Broad Ave Binghampton Memphis TN 1.jpg|thumb|Broad Avenue in 2010]]
'''Broad Avenue''' is a street and [[arts district]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], known for its transformation from a collection of vacant storefronts to a vibrant arts district in less than a decade.

==History==
Broad Avenue was originally the main street of [[Binghampton, Memphis|Binghampton]], a small [[railroad town]] chartered in 1895. In 1919, the city was [[annexed]] by [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], and Broad Avenue gradually fell into disrepair. In the mid-2000s, various efforts were organized to bring the street back into use. From 2007 to 2012, the street became a vibrant arts district as local businesses began to occupy the then-vacant storefronts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/nov/23/editorial-broad-avenue-struts-its-stuff/ |title=Editorial: Broad Avenue struts its stuff|publisher=The Commercial Appeal |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2010 a two-day "demonstration" was arranged in which the still vacant storefronts along Broad were temporarily filled with local vendors and stores in order to show what the street had the potential to become.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmctv.com/Global/story.asp?S=13521178 |title=Taking Back Our Neighborhoods: A New Face for an Old Broad - Action News 5 - Memphis, Tennessee |publisher=Wmctv.com |date=2012-10-02 |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
In May 2011, French artist Guillaume Alby painted a large 1,800-square-foot geometrically styled mural on the 2500 block of Broad Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey |first=Thomas |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/may/07/wall-power/ |title=Muralist transforms warehouse wall along Broad Avenue |publisher=The Commercial Appeal |date=2012-09-25 |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of other art projects followed. These included another mural on a warehouse wall facing the street and the lighting-up of the iconic watertower which identifies Broad Avenue, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey |first=Thomas |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/mar/17/2-art-projects-will-brighten-broad-ave/ |title=2 art projects will brighten Broad Ave. |publisher=The Commercial Appeal |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also home to a bi-annual art walk, in which local artists display their wares along the street. The event is accompanied by free music and food from local restaurants and bakeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memphisconnect.com/2012/04/12/21335/ |title=Spring Art Walk on Broad Avenue Friday |publisher=MemphisConnect |date=2012-04-12 |accessdate=2012-10-06 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cycling==
Broad Avenue is currently the home of the Memphis Greenline (cycling path) headquarters, and was used as an early demonstration of proposed bike lanes for the city of Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memphisdailynews.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=54312 |title=Broad Ambitions |publisher=Memphis Daily News |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420160055/http://www.memphisdailynews.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=54312 |archivedate=2013-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration, which proved to be a success (resulting in the permanent addition of bike lanes) was arranged by [[Livable Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.bikeleague.org/blog/2010/11/a-better-block-on-broad/ |title=Bikeleague.org Blog » Blog Archive » A Better Block on Broad |publisher=Blog.bikeleague.org |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2012-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006044431/http://blog.bikeleague.org/blog/2010/11/a-better-block-on-broad/ |archivedate=2012-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, it was proposed as a connector for cyclists between [[Overton Park]] and [[Shelby Farms Park]], two key locations in Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patterson |first=Sara |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/jul/10/greenline-could-get-link-to-midtown |title=Shelby Farms Greenline could get link to Midtown Memphis |publisher=The Commercial Appeal |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C++/WinRT''' is the officially supported, modern C++ language projection for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Runtime]] platform, designed to provide you with first-class access to the modern [[Windows API]]. The C++/WinRT language projection is ''not'' an extension to the C++ language; rather, it's implemented as an entirely standard modern ISO C++17 header-file-based library. With C++/WinRT, you can author and consume Windows Runtime APIs using any standards-compliant C++17 compiler.

C++/WinRT ships as part of the [[Microsoft Windows SDK]]. It was introduced in version 10.0.17134.0 (Windows 10, version 1803) of the SDK. There is also [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] support for C++/WinRT, by means of project and item templates, as well as MSBuild properties and targets. Visual Studio support is provided in the form of the [https://aka.ms/cppwinrt/vsix/ C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension] (VSIX), which you can download and install from the [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/ Visual Studio Marketplace].

C++/WinRT was originally released in 2015 by [https://kennykerr.ca/ Kenny Kerr]. Shortly afterward, the technology and Kerr's expertise were brought in-house to [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="Kk2Ms"&gt;[https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/mt745090.aspx How Kenny Kerr Brought C++/WinRT to Microsoft] MSDN Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; C++/WinRT is now Microsoft's recommended replacement for both the [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh438466.aspx Windows Runtime C++ Template Library] (WRL), and for [[C++/CX]].&lt;ref name="IntroToCppWinRT"&gt;[https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/intro-to-using-cpp-with-winrt/ Introduction to C++/WinRT] docs.microsoft.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

[[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Runtime]] is based on [[Component Object Model]] (COM) APIs, and it's designed to be accessed through ''language projections''. A language projection hides the COM details, and provides a more natural programming experience for a given language. For C++ developers, C++/WinRT is the officially supported, modern C++ language projection.

As of version 10.0.17134.0 (Windows 10, version 1803), the [[Microsoft Windows SDK]] contains a header-file-based standard C++ library for consuming first-party [[Windows API]]s (that is, [[Windows Runtime]] [[API]]s in Windows namespaces).&lt;ref name="IntroToCppWinRT"/&gt; C++/WinRT also ships with the &lt;code&gt;cppwinrt.exe&lt;/code&gt; tool, which you can point at a [[Windows Runtime]] metadata (.winmd) file to generate a header-file-based standard C++ library that ''projects'' the APIs described in the metadata for consumption from C++/WinRT code. [[Windows Runtime]] metadata (.winmd) files provide a canonical way of describing a Windows Runtime API surface. By pointing the &lt;code&gt;cppwinrt.exe&lt;/code&gt; tool at metadata, you can generate a library for use with any runtime class implemented in a second- or third-party Windows Runtime component, or implemented in your own application.

With C++/WinRT, you can also implement your own runtime classes using standard C++, without resorting to COM-style programming. For a runtime class, you describe your types in a [https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/midl-3/intro/ MIDL file] (.idl), and from that file the &lt;code&gt;midl.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cppwinrt.exe&lt;/code&gt; tools generate your implementation boilerplate source code files for you, ready for you to add your implementation. You can alternatively just implement interfaces by deriving from a base class that's part of the C++/WinRT header library. These techniques employ the [[curiously recurring template pattern]] for convenient and performant function-calling via static dispatch. In general, C++/WinRT makes clever and efficient use of a host of modern ISO C++11 (and later) language features to the benefit of developer productivity and run-time performance. Features that were not available when C++/WinRT's predecessors ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh438466.aspx WRL] and [[C++/CX]]) were designed.

You use standard C++ data types, algorithms, and keywords when you use C++/WinRT. The projection does have its own custom data types, but in most cases you don't need to learn them because they provide appropriate conversions to and from standard types. That way, you can continue to use the standard C++ language features that you're accustomed to using, and the source code that you already have. C++/WinRT makes it extremely easy to call Windows Runtime APIs in any C++ application, from Win32 to UWP.

C++/WinRT performs better and produces smaller binaries than any other language option for the Windows Runtime. It even outperforms handwritten code using the application binary interface (ABI) directly. That's because the abstractions use modern C++ idioms that the Visual C++ compiler is designed to optimize. This includes magic statics, empty base classes, strlen elision, as well as many newer optimizations in the latest version of [[Microsoft Visual C++]] targeted specifically at improving the performance of C++/WinRT.

== History ==

Design and development of C++/WinRT was begun in 2014 by the then-independent software developer [https://kennykerr.ca/ Kenny Kerr]. At the time, the prevailing way for developers to call [[Windows Runtime]] APIs using C++ was with the [[C++/CX]] language projection. C++/CX adds non-standard extensions to the C++ language, such as the &lt;code&gt;ref new&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; (hat) notation inherited from C++/CLI. It hadn't been fully appreciated then that advances in ISO C++ language features meant that it had become possible to design a Windows Runtime language projection for pure standard C++, without extensions. "There are a lot of very experienced C++ developers at Microsoft who have spent decades-long careers working with C++ and COM," Kerr says. "I think it took someone who didn't realize that it was impossible to just try it anyway and show that it works."&lt;ref name="Kk2Ms"/&gt;

"I had had some previous experience projecting COM APIs into modern C++, so I decided to see whether I could apply those same techniques to the Windows Runtime." One early challenge in developing C++/WinRT was managing the trade-offs that the Windows Runtime makes to support projections for JavaScript and managed .NET languages out of the box. The complexity in the way that generic collections work across language projections is another example of these design challenges, as was coming up with an efficient way for standard C++ to handle the Windows Runtime's interface-versioning model. "It really pushed my understanding of C++ at that time, and it's since pushed the [[Microsoft Visual C++]] compiler to more efficiently handle such techniques at this scale."

=== Name ===

There is good reason for C++/WinRT's name to reference the [[Windows Runtime]] (WinRT), rather than the [[Universal Windows Platform]] (UWP). This is because you can call Windows Runtime APIs (and, therefore, you can benefit from C++/WinRT) in any C++ application, from Win32 to UWP.

'''Carnation''' (Latin, caro, carnis, “flesh”), in [[painting]], refers to the representation of [[color]] of [[flesh]]. It is also used in describing a painting or [[drawing]] to signify the undraped parts of a figure.

==Usage==
The use of carnation requires very attentive study and great skill in the painter. It varies with the sex of the individual, with the classes and countries to which the subjects belong, with the passions, the state of the health, etc. The [[cheek]]s are, in a healthy subject, of a lively red; the [[breast]], [[neck]] and upper part of the arms of a soft white; the belly yellowish. At the extremities the color becomes colder, and at the points assumes a [[violet (color)|violet]] tint, on account of the [[transparency and translucency|transparency]] of the skin. All these shades require to be softly blended. Two faults in carnation are chiefly to be avoided: hardness, the fault of the masters of the 15th century, and too great weakness. [[Guido Reni]] not infrequently painted his flesh so that it appeared almost bloodless. The French school has gone farthest in this respect. The flesh of the followers of this school often looks like [[porcelain]] or [[wax]]. [[Titian]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] are unrivaled in their rendering of carnation.

'''Ceremonial drums''' are used in a ritual context by indigenous peoples around the world, often accompanied by singing or chanting.

In the circumpolar regions the drums have been classified by traits such as the knob, frame design, size, membrane motifs, ornaments, etc. There are therefore two main groups of drums: those with internal and those with external knobs. Drums with internal knobs are found amongst the [[Chukchi people|Tjuktjer]] in Asia and among North American [[Inuit]]. Drums with external knobs are more widespread and are divided into four types:
* West Siberian: ([[Khant peoples|Khant]], [[Mansi people|Mansi]], [[Nenets people|Nenets]])
* South Siberian: (groups living above and in the mid regions of the [[Yenisei River]]). This type has many variations (Sajano-Yeniseic, Sjoric, Altaic)
* Mid Siberian: This type has two variants, Evenki-Yakutic and Nganasans-Entsic.
* Middle East: ([[Nanay]]ians, [[Udegey]]ians, [[Ulch people|Ulchians]], [[Nivkhs|Nivkhians]], [[Ainu people|Ainu]], [[Evenk peoples|Evenkians]], [[Buryats]]ians, [[Yukagir]]ians, [[Dolgans|Dolganians]], [[Oroch people|Orochs]], [[Oroks|Orokians]], [[Negidals|Negidalians]] and [[Zabaykalska Evenkians]], that is [[Evenks|Evenkians]] from the region far [[Lake Baikal]], where two types are characteristic: Amursic and Zabaykalic)

&lt;!--
* South Siberian type (groups living above and mid regions of the Jenisej river) and has many variations (Sajano-Jenisejska, Sjoriska, Altaiska)
* Mid Siberian type with two variants (Evenkic-Jakutic and Nganasansic-Entsic)
* Middle East type (Nanajer, Udegejer, Ultjer, Nivcher, Ainu, Evenker, Burjater, Jukagirer, Dolganer, Orotjer, Oroker, Negidaler and Zabajkalska Evenkians, i.e. [[evenks|Evenkians]] from the region far [[Lake Baikal]], where also two types are characteristic: Amurska and Zabajkalska)
--&gt;

The historical [[Sami people|Saami]] drum, sometimes termed [[rune drum]], belonged to the South Siberian kind, Sajano-Yeniseic subtype. (Those are, however, very similar to the Sjoric subtypes.) The Sami word for drum is 'goavddis', 'goabdes ' or 'gievrie' and the Altaic term is 'komus'. The Sami drum-stick term is 'bállin'; the Altaic term is 'orba'. 

&lt;!-- And finally, the Sami term for shaman is naida (noajdde); the Mansi term is nait. The Saami drums are further divided into the following classes:
* Frame drum
** Svept frame drum (or Åsele type) -
** Ring drum -
** Angle drum -

'''Concord Watch Company''' is a Swiss [[luxury watch|luxury goods]] company that is part of the [[Movado]] group, which produces and distributes Movado, [[Ebel]], [[Coach, Inc.|Coach]], and [[Hugo Boss]]-branded watches. Founded in 1908, Concord was purchased in 1970 by the '''North American Watch Company''', which also distributed the [[Piaget SA|Piaget]] and [[Corum (watchmakers)|Corum]] lines of watches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/movado-group-inc-history/ |title=History of Movado Group, Inc. – FundingUniverse |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, Concord produced what would become some of the most marketed and respected luxury quartz watches on the market. Concord watches became recognized in large cities as status symbols and were noted for their innovation and design. Flagship quartz models such as the Concord Centurion and Concord Delirium ranged from $2,000 to $20,000, surpassing the price of base automatic [[Rolex]], [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]] and [[Omega SA|Omega]] wristwatches. By the 1990s, Concord watches fell out of style and grew obsolete amidst the rebranding of the company. While the brand still exists today, it never regained its market position nor visibility that it once had.

==History==
Founded in 1908 in [[Biel]], Switzerland, the brand was created to design watches with the American market in mind. Concord has made several innovations in its history, such as being one of the first “private label” luxury watches to incorporate precious metals and gems in its watches. It was also the first company to make a wristwatch made of coins.

In 1915, Concord started working with companies like [[Van Cleef &amp; Arpels]], [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]] and [[Cartier (jeweler)]] on providing them with high quality watches made out of precious metals and gems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concord.ch/concord-heritage/heritage-1908-1986/ |title=Concord Heritage &amp;#124; Concord US |publisher=Concord.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, President Truman gifted Concord watches to Stalin and Churchill during World War II peace talks, solidifying their position as a leading luxury watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crownandcaliber.com/watches/concord|title=Selling Your Concord Watch {{!}} Crown &amp; Caliber|website=www.crownandcaliber.com|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Concord was purchased by the North American Watch Company. While the company struggled initially, it transitioned into a luxury quartz watch company, and during  the [[quartz crisis]] it attained a large market share despite other competitors like Rolex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bobswatches.com/rolex-blog/rolex-info/oysterquartz-datejust-17013.html|title=Watch of the Week: Oysterquartz Datejust 17013 {{!}} Bob's Rolex Blog|date=2018-04-18|work=Bob's Watches|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1980s, Concord watches became some of the most recognizable watches on the American luxury watch market, seeing massive sales in luxury stores throughout the Americas. While the majority of Swiss watch makers were in financial trouble due to the quartz crisis Concord took advantage of the situation by producing some of the most expensive quartz watches on the market. By the early 1980s, the North American Watch Company had the largest advertising budget of any Swiss watch company, spending over $14 million annually to attract celebrity endorsements from [[Jimmy Connors]], [[Björn Borg|Bjorn Borg]], [[Joe Montana]], [[Tom Landry]] and [[Martha Graham]] in such expensive publications like the [[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]], [[Texas Monthly]], [[Architectural Digest]], [[Town and Country Magazine|Town and Country]] and [[Business Week]] while appearing on TV shows such as [[Miami Vice]], [[Charlie's Angels]], [[The Love Boat]], [[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]] and [[Hill Street Blues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/47/Movado-Group-Inc.html|title=Movado Group, Inc. - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Movado Group, Inc.|website=www.referenceforbusiness.com|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NywEAAAAMBAJ|title=Texas Monthly|last=Communications|first=Emmis|date=1982-11-01|publisher=Emmis Communications|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/business/the-art-of-selling-to-the-very-rich.html|title=THE ART OF SELLING TO THE VERY RICH|last=Kleinfield|first=N. r|date=1986-06-15|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.movadogroup.com/company/cuban_frame.htm|title=Movado Group Inc. - The Company - Watch Time Article: A Historical Perspective of Movado Group, Inc. from the Chairman and Founder|last=TDOinc.com|website=www.movadogroup.com|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
[[File:Concord Watch.jpg|thumb|An example of an 18K Concord Centurion quartz watch. The advertised price in the New York Magazine in December 1982 was $7950 USD.]]
In 1979, it had a major breakthrough with the invention of the Delirium Watch which was the thinnest watch ever made at the time at 1.98&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Subsequently, a Delirium 2 was released which was even thinner at 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Norma, [http://www.capetowncorp.com/whatsnew/concordarticle.html "The Concord Delirium: One of the Top 20 Wristwatches of the 20th Century"], ''American Time'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable watch was the Concord Centurion, an ultra-thin sports watch introduced in 1979 that bore a resemblance to the Piaget Polo, the latter billed as the most expensive mass-produced luxury watch.

By the 1990s, Concord watches began to fade as the quartz crisis came to a close and the bold Concord look fell out of favor. In addition the parent of Concord, the North American Watch Company sought to focus more on mid- to high-range watches suited to middle class Americans, as opposed to luxury watches for the select few. The company faced a setback when in 1996, the North American Watch Company rebranded as [[Movado]], a mid range watch company that had been purchased in 1984 by the North American Watch Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.movadogroup.com/company/cuban_frame.htm|title=Movado Group Inc. - The Company - Watch Time Article: A Historical Perspective of Movado Group, Inc. from the Chairman and Founder|last=TDOinc.com|website=www.movadogroup.com|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This robbed the company of their exclusive luxury watch branding. Further turmoil happened in 2004 when Movado purchased financially troubled luxury Swiss watch maker [[Ebel]], causing Concord to be shunned in favor of their new acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/19/business/lvmh-leader-looks-for-the-right-match-in-his-fashion-empire.html|title=LVMH Leader Looks For the Right Match In His Fashion Empire|last=Rozhon|first=Tracie|date=2004-02-19|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the company made a drastic change in its vision. It closed most of its existing dealerships as sluggish sales and lack of a specific market created a huge grey market that hurt the company’s reputation. The launch of the C1 was highly touted and targeted the ever-popular luxury sport market. The style and pricing were designed to compete with watches such as [[Panerai]], [[Audemars Piguet]] and [[Hublot]]. With only a couple of hundred dealers worldwide Concord was hoping for a grand relaunch into the Luxury sector. In 2008, watches ranged from between $3,500 to $30,000 in pricing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jckonline.com/2016/02/19/watch-company-reinvented|title=The Watch Company. Reinvented. {{!}} JCK|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Concord created two new C1 pieces. The C1 worldtimer and the C1 Gravity Tourbillion. The later won the prestigious “Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Geneve” as “Best design of the year 2008”. Whether this success will lead to ultimate success remains to be seen.

In 2009, Alex Grinberg was appointed as the worldwide CEO of Concord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://professionalwatches.com/2009/07/movado_group_appoints_alex_gri.html |title=PROFESSIONAL WATCHES™ &amp;#124; Luxury Watch Guide: Movado Group appoints Alex Grinberg president of Concord |publisher=Professionalwatches.com |date=2009-07-30 |accessdate=2011-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715120243/http://professionalwatches.com/2009/07/movado_group_appoints_alex_gri.html |archive-date=2011-07-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''console''' in [[heraldry]] is a decorative frame or support surrounding a heraldic [[shield]] or [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]. 

The term derives from the compound [[Latin]] verb ''consolor'' "to alleviate, lighten", from the verb ''solor'', "to assuage, soothe, relieve, mitigate", plus the preposition ''con/com/cum'', "with".&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, &amp; Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;  It thus serves to add interest to and mitigate the harshness of the stark outline of the shield, were used primarily for decorative purposes, rather than for its original purpose of identifying a [[knight]] in battle. The term "console" in [[architecture]] is generally used for elements which provide support, such as [[corbel]]s on a [[console table]].

The theme of '''death within ancient Greek art''' has continued from the [[Early Bronze Age]] all the way through to the [[Hellenistic period]]. The Greeks used architecture, pottery, and funerary objects as different mediums through which to portray death. These depictions include mythical deaths, deaths of historical figures, and commemorations of those who died in war. This page includes various examples of the different types of mediums in which death is presented in Greek art.

== Examples of architecture ==
[[Greek heroa]] were tombs dedicated to both mythological and actual heroes of the Ancient Greek world. These tombs contained the remains of the hero and acted as a place where citizens of the polis where the tomb was located could hold feasts as a hero cult in order to honor the hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47675022|title=The Greek way of death|last=1947-|first=Garland, Robert,|date=2001|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801487463|edition= 2nd|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|oclc=47675022}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were built in a variety of different styles, were located in many different polis across Greece, and their legacy was continued by the Romans.

The [[heroon at Nemea]] is an example of a hero shrine, the resting place of the late Ophletes and a place for Greeks to worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43477508|title=Nemea : a guide to the site and museum|date=1990|publisher=University of California Press|others=Miller, Stephen G. (Stephen Gaylord), 1942-, Abraldes, Ana M.|isbn=0585160430|location=Berkeley|oclc=43477508}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heroon was a way to memorialize the infant and transform his legacy from that of a mere mortal to that of a hero. Ophletes' death elevated him above the status of other humans and made him more divine, and thus his final resting place became a sacred space to Greeks. The ancient Greeks would use this space and the surrounding land to host the Nemean Games in Ophletes' honor, as well as practice magic and other cult activities.

The [[grave monument from Kallithea]] is an example of a funerary monument from the Hellenistic period. They were for wealthy people and families that served to remind the living of the power and wealth of the dead by exhibiting conspicuous consumption. This monument was for a non Greek family from Romania, who became prominent in Athens in the 300s. The grave monument had a podium, pedestal, a frieze, and a naiskos with statues of two family members and a slave inside. These grave monument largely disappeared in Attica after an austerity law that banned them.

The [[tombs at Xanthos]], Lycia, are funerary architecture that display the cultural synthesis enacted by a Lycian Dynasty. The tombs at Xanthos primarily take the form of pillar tombs, which were composed of a stone burial chamber on top of a stone pillar. The decorative motifs surrounding many of the elevated burial chambers depicts Near Eastern imagery, with roots in Persia. However, the Lycian rulers employed Greek artisans to carve the relief sculptures, primarily in the Archaic style. Thus, the monumentalization of the dead rulers is accompanied by regionally-specific visual motifs that bring together both Greek and Near Eastern influences.

[[Brasidas]] was a successful Spartan General who won a major battle in Amphipolis during the second Peloponnesian War. After Brasidas died, the people of Amphipolis monumentalized him by cremating him, placing his ashes in a silver ossuary with a gold wreath, and burying him in a cist grave within the city walls. Sparta also dedicated a cenotaph in his honor. His legacy was remembered and celebrated with these things and contributes to the theme of monumentalization of important Greek figures after death.

== Examples of pottery and painters ==

The [[Jar (pelike) with Odysseus and Elpenor|Pelike]] of Odysseus and Elpenor is a jar from Attika in 440 B.C. It portrays Elpenor begging Odysseus to give him a proper burial. Elpenor had drunkenly fallen off the roof of a boat and his death went unnoticed which means he did not get his burial rights and could not proceed through his journey in the underworld. Hermes stands next to Odysseus watching over the scene as he a guide for the dead.

The [[Thanatos Painter]] is a lekythoi painter from Athens, Greece in the 5th century BCE. The lekythoi attributed to the Thanatos Painter are all white-ground that is specifically used in the funerary context. These lekythoi also had depiction of death on them and thanatos is the Greek word for death. They were used as grave markers and would hold special oil used for funerals.

Another example of pottery being used in funerary contexts is the [[Eleusis Amphora]] by the Polyphemos painter, which is a neck amphora that dates back to the Middle Protoattic (ca. 650-625 B.C.E.). The amphora's decoration reflects the pottery of the [[Orientalizing period]] (ca. 710-600 B.C.E.), a style in which human and animal figures depict mythological scenes. It was used as an urn, as it was found to contain the remains of a young boy.

[[Ancient Greek funerary vases]] were made to resemble vessels used for elite male drinking parties, called symposiums. Funerary vases were often painted with symposiums, or Greek tragedies that involved death. There are many types of funerary vases including [[amphorae]], [[krater]]s, [[oinochoe]], and [[kylix]] cups. Funerary scenes show us how the Greeks treated the deceased. Such ritualistic practices included laying out the body for mourners to see, called prothesis. An example of this was painted on the [[Dipylon Amphora|Dipylon amphora]]. Next, was the ekphora, which is the moving of the body to a cemetery, usually in a procession. If cremation was practiced, then the ashes of the deceased would be placed inside the funerary vase, and buried.

The [[Odysseus in the Underworld krater]] is a Lucanian kalyx-[[krater]] decorated in the [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] style dating to dating to ca. 380 BC - ca. 360 BC. Side A of the krater depicts Homer's story of Odysseus's visit to the Underworld to consult the dead seer Teiresias. This meeting is known as a nekuomanteion or “consultation with the dead”. Side B depicts the judgment of Paris where Hermes asks Paris, the Trojan prince, to arbitrate the contest between Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena and determine who is the most beautiful.

The suicide of Ajax vase was made by Exekias during the Archaic Period. The scene depicts Ajax preparing for his suicide in black-figure on a neck amphora. Ajax is bent over his sword, which he is placing in the ground. There is a tree to one side of him and his suit of armor on the other side. This scene is unusual in Greek art because it depicts the moment right before the death, rather than the violence of the actual death.

The [[Dipylon krater]] from Athens displays representations of funerary rituals for death and burial. The prothesis was a public "laying out" of the deceased similar to a modern wake, and the ekphora was a transportation of the body to the grave for burial. These rituals coincided with intense grief and extravagance, as those closest to the deceased attempted to mourn and celebrate his death.

Depictions of the death of Iphigenia are mostly on pottery. She was a young girl who was to be the sacrifice for Agamemnon's mistake. Pottery depictions of this mythological story are of two different versions. One where she dies, and the other is where her body is replaced with the corpse of an animal by Artemis, who saves her. The pottery depictions are mostly by the black-figure and red-figure techniques. They are also mostly amphoras and kraters. In my page, I wanted to include depictions of Iphigenia from all artistic aspects, not only pottery. Mosaic and plays have been made for Iphigenia.

== Examples of grave stelai and goods ==

The stelai which mark the burials in Grave Circles A and B in Mycenae demonstrate burial practices during the Late Bronze Age. Some of the stelai feature relief sculpture, including chariot scenes, hunting scenes, and spiral motifs. These scenes could potentially indicate a desire for display and conspicuous consumption and hint at the presence of warfare and social stratification at Mycenae.

The [[death masks of Mycenae]] are a collection of golden masks placed on male dead bodies entombed within circular grave sites located at the city of Mycenae. They are designed to represent the features of the deceased, immortalizing them after death. They also display the status of the deceased through conspicuous consumption, due to their valuable materials.

After finding a phenomenal amount of [[gold grave goods at Grave Circles A and B]] at Mycenae, the location earned the nickname "Golden Mycenae". It was a successful and wealthy area during the Bronze Age and the families buried in the shaft graves there memorialized their status using gold grave goods. They also distinguished which graves were for men and which were for women using grave goods. Generally, the men were buried with gold inlaid weapons while the women had gold jewelry, and both boasted their family's wealth.

The [[hellenistic stelai from Demetrias]] used art styles and sculpting techniques from the Hellenistic period to commemorate the deceased. Marble and stone stele were decorated with full and diverse colors which were used to depict both scenes from life and scenes from myth. By looking at grave stele such as "Aphrodeisia, Daughter of Theudotos," we can learn what life and art for Greeks during the hellenistic period was like.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2789">[[Image:Yarspas.jpg|thumb|The triple apse of an Orthodox church. The Altar is in the larger central apse, the Prothesis in the apse to the right, and the diaconicon in the one to the left.]]
The '''diaconicon''' ({{lang-el|διακονικόν|translit=diakonikon}}; [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: ''diakonik'') is, in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] [[church architecture|churches]], the name given to a chamber on the south side of the central [[apse]] of the church, where the vestments, books, etc., that are used in the Divine Services of the church are kept&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Diaconicon |volume=8 |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the sacred vessels are kept in the [[Prothesis (altar)|Prothesis]], which is on the north side of the sanctuary).

The diaconicon contains the ''thalassidion'' ([[piscina]]), a sink that drains into an honorable place where liquids such as the water used to wash holy things may be poured, and where the clergy may wash their hands before serving the [[Divine Liturgy]]. The diaconicon will usually have cabinets or drawers where the vestments and church hangings ([[antependia]]) may be safely stored. Here will also be kept the reserved charcoal, and a place for heating the ''[[Zeon (liturgy)|zeon]]'' (boiling water that is poured into the [[chalice (cup)|chalice]] before Communion). Towels and other necessary items will be kept here also.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Only [[bishop]]s or [[priest]]s may sit in the sanctuary; however, [[deacon]]s and [[altar servers]] may sit in the diaconicon when they are not needed for the service. Because the diaconicon is located behind the [[Iconostasis]] it is considered to be a holy place, and only those who have a specific liturgical duty to perform should go in, and any regulations pertaining to entry into the sanctuary apply here as well.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

During the reign of [[Justin II]] (565–574), owing to a change in the [[liturgy]], the Diaconicon and Prothesis came to be located in separate apses at the east end of the Sanctuary. Before that time there was only one apse.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the churches in central [[Syria]] of slightly earlier date, the diaconicon is rectangular, the side apses at [[Kalat-Seman]] having been added at a later date.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

It can also refer to the liturgical book specifying the functions of the deacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Diaconicum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[history of literature]] of the [[Early Modern period]] ([[16th century in literature|16th]], [[17th century in literature|17th]] and partly [[18th century literature]]), or '''Early Modern literature''', succeeds [[Medieval literature]], and in Europe in particular [[Renaissance literature]].

In Europe, the Early Modern period lasts roughly from 1550 to 1750, spanning the [[Baroque period]] and ending with the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[wars of the French Revolution]]. The Early Modern period in [[Persia]] corresponds to the rule of the [[Safavid dynasty]]. In [[Japan]], the "Early Modern period" ([[Edo period]]) is taken to last down to 1868 (the beginning of Industrialization during the [[Meiji period]]). In [[India]], the [[Mughal era]] lasts until the establishment of the [[British Raj]] in 1857. The [[Ottoman Empire]] underwent various attempts of modernization from 1828 ([[Tanzimat]]).

[[Chinese literature]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] remains mostly unaffected by European influence, and effects of modernization that would lead up to the [[New Culture Movement]] became apparent only from the Late Qing period in the 1890s.

== Europe ==
{{See|Early Modern English literature|Elizabethan literature|Jacobean era literature|Restoration literature|Augustan literature|German literature of the Baroque period|French literature of the 17th century}}

A new spirit of science and investigation in Europe was part of a general upheaval in human understanding, which began with the discovery of the [[New world]] in 1492 and continues through the subsequent centuries, even up to the present day.

The form of writing now commonplace across the world—the [[novel]]—originated from the early modern period and grew in popularity in the next century.  Before the [[modern novel]] became established as a form there first had to be a transitional stage when "novelty" began to appear in the style of the epic poem.

Plays for entertainment (as opposed to religious enlightenment) returned to Europe's stages in the early modern period.  [[William Shakespeare]] is the most notable of the early modern playwrighters, but numerous others made important contributions, including [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Lope de Vega]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]]. From the 16th to the 18th century [[commedia dell'arte]] performers improvised in the streets of Italy and France. Some Commedia dell'arte plays were written down. Both the written plays and the [[improvisation]] were influential upon literature of the time, particularly upon the work of Molière. Shakespeare drew upon the arts of [[jester]]s and strolling players in creating new style comedies. All the parts, even the female ones, were played by men (''[[Drag (clothing)|en travesti]]'') but that would change, first in France and then in England too, by the end of the 17th century.

The earliest work considered an [[opera]] in the sense the work is usually understood dates from around 1597. It is ''[[Dafne]]'', (now lost) written by [[Jacopo Peri]] for an elite circle of literate [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanists]] who gathered as the "[[Florentine Camerata|Camerata]]".

[[Miguel de Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote de la Mancha]]'' has been called "the first novel" by many literary scholars (or the first of the modern European novels). It was published in two parts. The first part was published in 1605 and the second in 1615. It might be viewed as a parody of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' (and other examples of the [[Romance (heroic literature)|chivalric romance]]), in which case the novel form would be the direct result of poking fun at a collection of heroic folk legends. This is fully in keeping with the spirit of the age of enlightenment which began from about this time and delighted in giving a satirical twist to the stories and ideas of the past. It is worth noting that this trend toward satirising previous writings was only made possible by the [[printing press]]. Without the invention of [[mass production|mass-produced]] copies of a book it would not be possible to assume the reader will have seen the earlier work and will thus understand the references within the text. In the 18th century [[Daniel Defoe]] and [[Jonathan Swift]] wrote famous novels.

The 16th century saw outstanding [[epic poem]]s of [[Torquato Tasso]] and [[Luís de Camões]]. Later the most well-known [[poet]]s were [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]], [[John Milton]] and [[Alexander Pope]]. In turn [[Jean de La Fontaine]] and [[Charles Perrault]] are appreciated for their [[fable]]s.

== Ottoman Empire ==
{{Main|Ottoman literature}}
{{See|Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Poetry of the Ottoman Empire}}

The two primary streams of Ottoman written literature are poetry and [[prose]]. Of the two, poetry—specifically, Divan poetry—was by far the dominant stream. Moreover, until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of [[fiction]]; that is, there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], [[short story]], or [[novel]] (though analogous genres did, to some extent, exist in both the Turkish folk tradition and in Divan poetry).

Ottoman Divan poetry was a highly [[ritual]]ized and [[symbol]]ic art form. From the Persian poetry that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of [[symbol]]s whose meanings and interrelationships—both of similitude (مراعات نظير ''mura'ât-i nazîr'' / تناسب
''tenâsüb'') and opposition (تضاد ''tezâd'')—were more or less prescribed.

Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose never managed to develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of ''sec{{'}}'' (سجع, also transliterated as ''seci''), or [[rhymed prose]],&lt;ref&gt;Belge, 389&lt;/ref&gt; a type of writing descended from the Arabic ''[[saj']]'' and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]].

Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time. This tradition was exclusively [[Non-fiction|nonfictional]] in nature—the [[fiction]] tradition was limited to narrative poetry.&lt;ref&gt;One apparent exception was the ''Muhayyelât'' (مخيّلات "''Fancies''") of [[Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi|Ali Aziz Efendi]] of [[Crete]], a collection of stories of [[Fantastic|the fantastic]] that was written in 1796, though not published until 1867.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persia ==
{{See|Persian literature}}

Regarding the tradition of Persian love poetry during the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] era, Persian historian [[Ehsan Yarshater]] notes, "As a rule, the beloved is not a woman, but a young man. In the early centuries of Islam, the raids into [[Central Asia]] produced many young [[slavery|slaves]]. Slaves were also bought or received as gifts. They were made to serve as pages at court or in the households of the affluent, or as soldiers and bodyguards. Young men, slaves or not, also, served wine at banquets and receptions, and the more gifted among them could play music and maintain a cultivated conversation. It was [[Pederasty|love toward young pages, soldiers, or novices in trades and professions]] which was the subject of lyrical introductions to panegyrics from the beginning of Persian poetry, and of the ghazal."&lt;ref&gt;Yar-Shater, Ehsan. 1986. ''Persian Poetry in the Timurid and Safavid Periods,'' Cambridge History of Iran. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.973-974. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 15th century, the ''Indian style'' of Persian poetry (sometimes also called ''Isfahani'' or ''Safavi'' styles) took over. This style has its roots in the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] era and produced the likes of [[Amir Khusro|Amir Khosrow Dehlavi]], and Bhai [[Nand Lal Goya]]

== India ==
{{See|Indian literature|Early Modern Bengali literature|Early Modern Tamil literature|Literature of the Kingdom of Mysore}}

[[Classical Sanskrit literature]] went into decline in the High Middle Ages, to the benefit of [[Middle Indic]] vernaculars such as [[Old Hindi]], notably in use for Late Medieval [[Bhakti]] poetry. The [[Mughal era]] sees the development of various literary dialects such as ''[[Dakkhini]]'' or ''[[Urdu]]'', the latter showing heavy [[Persianization|Persian influence]].
The earliest examples of [[Khariboli]] can be seen in some of [[Kabir]] and [[Amir Khusro]]'s lines. More developed forms of Khariboli can be seen in some mediocre literature produced in early 18th century. Examples are ''Chand Chhand Varnan Ki Mahima'' by Gangabhatt, ''Yogavashishtha'' by Ramprasad Niranjani, ''Gora-Badal ki katha'' by Jatmal, ''Mandovar ka varnan'' by Anonymous, a translation of Ravishenacharya's ''Jain Padmapuran'' by Daulatram (dated 1824).

== Japan ==
{{See|Japanese literature}}

Literature during the largely peaceful [[Edo period|Edo Period]], in large part to the rise of the working and middle classes in the new capital of [[Edo]] (modern [[Tokyo]]), developed forms of popular drama which would later evolve into [[kabuki]].
The [[Jōruri (music)|joruri]] and kabuki dramatist [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] became popular at the end of the 17th century. [[Matsuo Bashō]] wrote ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'' (奥の細道, 1702), a travel diary. [[Hokusai]], perhaps Japan's most famous woodblock print artist, also illustrated fiction as well as his famous [[36 Views of Mount Fuji (Hokusai)|36 Views of Mount Fuji]].

Many genres of literature made their début during the Edo Period, helped by a rising literacy rate among the growing population of townspeople, as well as the development of lending libraries. Although there was a [[Rangaku|minor Western influence]] trickling into the country from the [[Dejima|Dutch settlement at Nagasaki]], it was the importation of Chinese vernacular fiction that proved the greatest outside influence on the development of Early Modern Japanese fiction. [[Ihara Saikaku]] might be said to have given birth to the modern consciousness of the novel in Japan, mixing vernacular dialogue into his humorous and cautionary tales of the pleasure quarters. [[Jippensha Ikku]] wrote ''[[Tōkaidōchū Hizakurige]]'', which is a mix of travelogue and comedy. Tsuga Teisho, Takebe Ayatari, and Okajima Kanzan were instrumental in developing the ''[[yomihon]]'', which were historical romances almost entirely in prose, influenced by Chinese vernacular novels such as [[Three Kingdoms]] and ''[[Shui hu zhuan]]''. Two ''yomihon'' masterpieces were written by [[Ueda Akinari]]: ''Ugetsu monogatari'' and ''Harusame monogatari''.

'''Emma Cons''' (4 March 1838 – 24 July 1912) was a British [[social reformer]], [[educationalist]] and [[theatre manager]].

==Early life==
Born in [[St. Pancras, London]],&lt;ref&gt;Census, England and Wales, 1861&lt;/ref&gt; she trained as an artist and joined the [[Ladies' Co-operative Art Guild]] in London, run by Caroline Hill, mother of the future housing reformer and founder of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], [[Octavia Hill]].  As Cons's father Frederick Cons was suffering from ill health, she needed to work and the Guild helped her get work as an [[limner|illuminator]] as well as restoring manuscripts for [[John Ruskin]].  Cons also tried working as a watch engraver, and as a [[stained glass]] designer but experienced harassment from men who resented a woman working amongst them.

From 1864, Cons worked for Octavia Hill as a rent collector, starting work at Barrett's Court, [[Oxford Street]].  Later Cons moved to South London, and in 1879 she established the [[South London Dwellings Company]] around Surrey Lodge, [[Lambeth]], near to [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]].

==Political career==
In 1889, Cons became the first female [[alderman]] on the [[London County Council]] (LCC), working alongside the first elected women members [[Jane Cobden]] (elected for Bow and Bromley) and Lady Sandhurst (elected for [[Brixton]]). The elections were challenged by anti-suffragists, but as Cons had not been elected, she had been asked by the LCC Progressives to become an alderman, and it was difficult to challenge her position.

When she voted, however, she became liable for a fine:  De Souza v. Cobden, which reached the [[Court of Appeal]] in 1891, ruled Cobden and Cons could legally be members of the council but could not vote.  After this, Cons' commitment to the cause of women's [[suffrage]] was energetic, and she served on the Committee for the Return of Women as Councillors, became Vice-President of the [[Women's Local Government Society]], and Vice President of the Women's Liberal Federation.

==Educationalist==
Cons also helped found [[Swanley Horticultural College]] (which amalgamated with [[Wye College]] later part of [[Imperial College London]], a part of [[University of London]] before closure in 2009), in 1892, the first such college for women, and she founded [[Morley College]] for working men and women, aided by money donated by [[Bristol]] based millionaire manufacturer and philanthropist, [[Samuel Morley (MP)|Samuel Morley]].

Cons also founded the Working Girls Home, a hostel in [[Drury Lane]], London, and she established various crèches and clinics for women including what was described as 'the Home for Feeble-Minded girls' at [[Bodmin]].

==Cultural heritage==
[[File:Waterloo the old vic 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Old Vic Theatre]]]]
In 1880, Emma Cons, re-opened what is now the [[Old Vic Theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Cecily and Baylis, Lilian.(1926). ''The Old Vic''. Cape, London.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lambeth]], south [[London]], as the ''Royal Victoria Coffee and [[Music Hall]]''. It was "a cheap and decent place of amusement on strict [[Temperance movement|temperance]] lines". Through this initiative, she brought the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] and also [[opera]] to [[working class]] people.

In 1882, Samuel Morley began to take an interest in the affairs of the theatre, and in 1884 he joined the executive committee. He contributed a large amount of money to the scheme, and his business advice was of value. Morley College developed from the lectures given at the Old Vic.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Cons, Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, Cons devoted her autumn holiday in [[Cyprus]] to trying to help refugee [[Armenians]], who had fled from persecution in Turkey.  In 1908, Cons became the first woman to speak at the [[Institute of Directors]], on behalf of the South London Dwellings Company.

==Personal life==
Emma Cons died on 24 July 1912, of a cerebral haemorrhage, at Chippen's Bank, [[Hever, Kent]], home of her friend, [[Ethel Everest]].

Her niece, [[Lilian Baylis]] (1874–1937),&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, Elizabeth.(2006) ''Lilian Baylis: A Biography''. University of Hertfordshire Press, Hatfield. {{ISBN|1-902806-63-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; assisted in running the [[Old Vic]]. Her sister, Ellen Cons (1840–1920), was also closely associated with many philanthropic schemes, and was one of the governors of the Old Vic.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;

==Plaques to Emma Cons==
Plaques honouring Emma Cons are displayed outside the Old Vic on the corner with [[Waterloo Road, London|Waterloo Road]] and in the basement area bar. Another round [[blue plaque]] was put up by the Greater London Council, on the street wall of 136 Seymour Place, Marylebone, where she lived and worked. Today, the building is WLM Seymour Place.

[[File:Linnet kineograph 1886.jpg|thumb|1886 illustration of the kineograph]]

A '''flip book''' or '''flick book''' is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change.  Flip books are often illustrated books for children, but may also be geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings.  Flip books are not always separate books, but may appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, often in the page corners.  Software packages and Websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.

== Functionality ==
Rather than "reading" left to right, a viewer simply stares at the same location of the pictures in the flip book as the pages turn.  The book must also be flipped with enough speed for the illusion to work, so the standard way to "read" a flip book is to hold the book with one hand and flip through its pages with the thumb of the other hand.  The German word for flip book—''Daumenkino'', literally "thumb cinema"—reflects this process.

== History and cultural uses ==
[[File:Daumenkino kol.jpg|thumb|A flip book]]
It has sometimes been assumed that the relatively simple flip book has been around since long before the invention of the more complicated 19th century animation devices like the [[phenakistiscope]] (1832) and the [[zoetrope]] (1866), but no conclusive evidence has been found. There are some medieval illuminated books with sequential images, such as ''Sigenot'' (circa 1470).&lt;ref&gt;http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/cpg67/0001/thumbs?sid=cf04d0c1f1b9e65a5338bc1a06222e96#/current_page&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations in ''Sigenot'' are consistently framed and have short intervals between different phases of action, but the images can not produce the illusion of a fluent motion. The necessary notion of instances smaller than a second would not really develop before the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ|first=Suzanne|last=Buchan|title=Pervasive Animation|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The oldest known documentation of the flip book appeared in September 1868, when it was patented by [[John Barnes Linnett]] under the name ''kineograph'' ("moving picture").  They were the first form of animation to employ a linear sequence of images rather than circular (as in the older [[phenakistoscope]]).  The German film pioneer, [[Max Skladanowsky]], first exhibited his [[film|serial photographic images]] in flip book form in 1894, as he and his brother Emil did not develop their own [[image projector|film projector]] until the following year.  In 1894, [[Herman Casler]] invented a mechanized form of flip book called the [[Mutoscope]], which mounted the pages on a central rotating cylinder rather than binding them in a book.  The mutoscope remained a popular attraction through the mid-twentieth century, appearing as coin-operated machines in [[penny arcade (venue)|penny arcades]] and [[amusement park]]s. In 1897, the English filmmaker Henry William Short marketed his "Filoscope", which was a flip book placed in a metal holder to facilitate flipping.

Flip books are now largely considered a toy or novelty for children, and were once a common "prize" in cereal and [[Cracker Jack]] boxes.  However, in addition to their role in the birth of cinema, they have also been an effective promotional tool since their creation for such decidedly adult products as [[car|automobiles]] and cigarettes. They continue to be used in marketing today, as well as in art and published photographic collections. Vintage flip books are popular among collectors, and especially rare ones from the late 19th to early 20th century have been known to fetch thousands of dollars in sales and auctions.

Since 2007, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] has started its films with a [[production logo]] that initially evokes a flip book.  It starts with a view of an empty page of paper, then as the pages start to turn, details are drawn in to reveal [[Mickey Mouse]] in ''[[Steamboat Willie]]''.

The first international flip book festival was held in 2004, by the [[Akademie Schloss Solitude]] in [[Stuttgart]]. Another international flip book festival was held in [[Linz]], [[Austria]] in 2005.

In 2010 Hungary postal services released a flip book of stamps depicting a moving [[gömböc]].&lt;ref&gt;http://gomboc-shop.com/product/stamps-mini-booklet&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Israel Philatelic Federation]] released an "Israeli Animation Stamp Booklet" in November 2010 with 15 stamps designed by Mish to be animated when flipping the pages. It commemorated the 50th anniversary of [[ASIFA]], the 25th anniversary of ASIFA Israel and the "Flip Book 250th Anniversary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2IZ7DV2ppg|title=Flipbook / Stamps : ISRAELI ANIMATION STAMP BOOKLET|last=Doc HEEZA|date=20 December 2010|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://israelphilately.org.il/en/catalog/series/1191/Israeli%20Animation%20-%20Booklet&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Finnish passport]] design released in 2012 contains a flipbook of a walking moose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/new-finnish-passport-is-a-flip-book-2013-3?IR=T|title=Finland's New Passport Doubles As A Flip Book of a Walking Moose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''fractal expressionism''' was coined by physicist-artist Richard Taylor and co-authors to distinguish fractal art generated directly by artists from fractal art generated using mathematics and/or computers.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Fractals are patterns that repeat at increasingly fine scales and are prevalent in natural scenery (examples include clouds, rivers, and mountains).&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, BB, The Fractal Geometry of Nature, WH Freedman, New York, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Fractal expressionism implies a direct expression of nature's patterns in an art work.

== Jackson Pollock's poured paintings ==

The initial studies of fractal expressionism focused on the poured paintings by the American artist [[Jackson Pollock]] (1912-1956), whose work has traditionally been associated with the [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist movement]].&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature"&gt;[Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor1999physicsworld"&gt;["Fractals Determine Date of Paintings." Physics World 04 June 1999: n. pag. Web. &lt;http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/1999/jun/04/fractals-determine-date-of-paintings&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock’s patterns had previously been referred to as “natural” and “organic”, inviting speculation by author John Briggs in 1992 that Pollock's work featured fractals.&lt;ref&gt;John Briggs, Fractals, Touchstone Publishers, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Taylor built a pendulum device called the Pollockizer which painted fractal patterns bearing a similarity to Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Computer analysis of Pollock's work published by Taylor et al.  in a 1999 Nature article found that Pollock's painted patterns have characteristics that match those displayed by nature's fractals (specifically, they demonstrate a statistical [[self-similarity]] quantified by a non-integer dimension over a magnification range of 1.5-2 orders of magnitude).  This analysis supported clues (see below) that Pollock's patterns are fractal and reflect "the fingerprint of nature".&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature" /&gt;

Taylor noted several similarities between Pollock's painting style and the processes used by nature to construct its landscapes.  For instance, he cites Pollock's propensity to revisit paintings that he had not adjusted in several weeks as being comparable to cyclic processes in nature, such as the seasons or the tides.&lt;ref name="artbook"&gt;[Taylor, Richard. "Fractal Expressionism—Where Art Meets Science." Art and Complexity. Ed. John Casti and Anders Karlqvist. 1st ed. Greenwich: JAI, 2003. 117-44. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Taylor observed several visual similarities between the patterns produced by nature and those produced by Pollock as he painted.  He points out that Pollock abandoned the use of a traditional frame for his paintings, preferring instead to roll out his canvas on the floor; this, Taylor asserts, is more compatible with how nature works than traditional painting techniques because the patterns in nature's scenery are not artificially bounded.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;

The perceived similarities between the processes and patterns involved in Pollock's paintings and those of nature compelled Taylor to posit that the same "basic trademark" of nature's pattern construction also appears in Pollock's work.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;  Since some natural fractals are generated by a process known as "chaos",&lt;ref name="chaosbook"&gt;[Cvitanovic´, Predrag, Roberto Artuso, Ronnie Mainieri, and Gábor Vattay. Chaos: Classical and Quantum. Copenhagen: Niels Bohr Institute, 2016. ChaosBook.org. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt; including fractals in human physiology,&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Bassingthwaighte et al, Fractal Physiology, Oxford University press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor believed that Pollock's painting process might also have been chaotic, and could therefore leave behind a fractal pattern.  Taylor's hypothesis seems to be reflected in Pollock's statement "I am nature", which he made when asked if nature was a source of inspiration for his work.&lt;ref name="krasner"&gt;Krasner, Lee. "Lee Krasner Oral History." Interview by Dorothy Seckler. Archives of American Art. Smithsonian, 19 May 2005. Web. 30 Dec. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Pollock is also quoted as stating "No chaos, damn it",  in response to a Time magazine article that referred to his paintings as "chaotic".&lt;ref name="nochaos"&gt;[Karmel, Pepe, ed. Jackson Pollock: Key Interviews, Articles and Reviews. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;   However, chaos theory was not understood until after Pollock's death, so he could not have been referring to the chaotic systems in nature but rather its common usage to mean disorder. In the famous film footage of [[Hans Namuth]],&lt;ref name="[https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/ sfmoma]"&gt;[Jackson Pollock: Paintings Have a Life of Their Own. Perf. Jackson Pollock. SFMOMA. SFMOMA, n.d. Web. &lt;https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock says his paintings are no accident, and that he was able to control the flow of paint onto the canvas.

Taylor points to two aspects of Pollock's painting process that have the potential to introduce fractal patterns. The first is Pollock's motion as he moved around the canvas, which Taylor hypothesized followed a Levy flight, a type of chaotic motion that is known to leave behind a fractal pattern.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"&gt;[Mandelbrot, Benoit B. The Fractal Geometry of Nature. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1982. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, a number of studies have shown that the motions associated with human balance have fractal characteristics. The second source of chaos could be introduced through Pollock's pouring technique.  Falling fluid has the capability of changing from a non-chaotic to a chaotic flow, meaning that Pollock could have introduced a chaotic flow of paint as he dripped it onto the canvas.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt; Although the fractal characteristics of human balance and falling liquid are generated on Pollock's painting time and length scales, physicist [[Predrag Cvitanovic]] notes that it would be quite an artistic challenge to control them: such parameters "are in no sense observable and measurable on the length-scales and time-scales dominated by chaotic dynamics".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Since Taylor's initial Pollock analysis in 1999, more than ten research groups have used various forms of fractal analysis to successfully quantify Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Mureika, C.C.

Lee, S 2007"/&gt; Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot (who invented the term fractal) and art theorist Francis O’Connor (the chief Pollock scholar) are well known advocates of fractal expressionism.&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"&gt;J. Rehmeyer, “Fractal or Fake?”, ScienceNews, vol. 171, 122-123, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see o'conner's website&lt;/ref&gt;

== The relationship between fractal expressionism and fractal fluency ==

Fractal expressionism is related to fractal fluency&lt;ref&gt;23 Taylor, RP, and Spehar B, Fractal Fleuncy: An Intimate Relationship Between the Brain and Processing of Fractal Stimuli, In: The Fractal Geometry of the Brain. New York: Springer; 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; because the latter provides an appealing motivation for why artists such as Pollock might aspire to Fractal Expressionism.  Fractal fluency is a neuroscience model that proposes that, through exposure to nature’s fractal scenery, people’s visual systems have adapted to efficiently process fractals with ease. This adaptation occurs at many stages of the visual system, from the way people’s eyes move to which regions of the brain get activated. Fluency puts the viewer in a ‘comfort zone’ so inducing an aesthetic experience. Neuroscience experiments have shown that Pollock’s paintings induce the same positive physiological responses in the observer as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals.&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"&gt;R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar, P. Van Donkelaar and C.M. Hagerhall, “Perceptual and Physiological Responses to Jackson Pollock’s Fractals,” Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, vol. 5 1- 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of fractal fluency and the associated aesthetics, other artists might be expected to display fractal expressionism. One year before Taylor’s publication, mathematician Richard Voss quantified Chinese art using fractal analysis.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"&gt;R. Voss, Fractal Image Encoding and Analysis, Springer, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other groups have used computer analysis to identify fractal content in a number of Western and Eastern artists,&lt;ref name="C. Redies, J 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D.J. Field, 2008"/&gt; most recently in Pollock’s colleague Willem De Kooning’s work.&lt;ref&gt;A. Forsythe et al, Journal of Neurophysiology, vol. 31, 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above analyzed works, symbolic representations of fractals can be found in cultures across the continents spanning several centuries, including Roman, Egyptian, Aztec, Incan and Mayan civilizations. They frequently predate patterns named after the mathematicians who subsequently developed their visual characteristics. For example, although von Koch is famous for developing The Koch Curve in 1904, a similar shape featuring repeating triangles was first used to depict waves in friezes by Hellenic artists (300 B.C.E.). In the 13th century, repetition of triangles in Cosmati Mosaics generated a shape later known in mathematics as The Sierpinski Triangle (named after Sierpinski’s 1915 pattern). Triangular repetitions are also found in the 12th century pulpit of The Ravello Cathedral in Italy. The lavish artwork within The Book of Kells (circa 800 C.E.) and the sculpted arabesques in The Jain Dilwara Temple in Mount Abu, India (1031 C.E.) also both reveal stunning examples of exact fractals. The artistic works of Leonardo da Vinci and Katsushika Hokusai serve as more recent examples from Europe and Asia, each reproducing the recurring patterns that they saw in nature. Da Vinci’s sketch of turbulence in water, The Deluge (1571–1518), was composed of small swirls within larger swirls of water. In The Great Wave off Kanagawa (1830–1833), Hokusai portrayed a wave crashing on a shore with small waves on top of a large wave. Other woodcuts from the same period also feature repeating patterns at several size scales: The Ghost of Kohada Koheiji shows fissures in a skull and The Falls At Mt. Kurokami features branching channels in a waterfall.

== The use of fractals to authenticate art and the associated controversy ==

Voss's 1998 study of Chinese art was the first demonstration of using fractal analysis to distinguish between the works of different artists.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"/&gt; Following Taylor's 1999 Pollock publication, Art conservator Jim Coddington proposed that fractal analysis should be explored as a technique to help authenticate Pollock paintings. In 2005, Taylor and colleagues published a fractal analysis of 14 authentic and 37 imitation Pollocks suggesting that, when combined with other techniques, fractal analysis might be useful for authenticating Pollock's work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Authenticating Pollock Paintings Using Fractal Geometry”, Pattern Recognition Letters, vol. 28, 695-702 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, The Pollock-Krasner Foundation requested a fractal analysis to be used for the first time in an authenticity dispute,&lt;ref&gt;A Abbott, Fractals and art: In the hands of a master, Nature 439, 648-650 (9 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis identified “significant deviations from Pollock’s characteristics.” Taylor cautioned that the results should be “coupled with other important information such as provenance, connoisseurship and materials analysis.” Two years later, materials scientists showed that pigments on the paintings dated from after Pollock’s death.
 
In 2006, the use of fractals to authenticate Pollocks stirred controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Jones-Smith et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings”Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E9-10, (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings” Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E10-11, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt; This controversy was triggered by physicists Katherine Jones-Smith and Harsh Mathur who claimed that the fractal characteristics identified by Taylor et al. are also present in crude sketches made in [[Adobe Photoshop]],&lt;ref name="kate2006nature"&gt;[Jones-Smith, Katherine. "Revisiting Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 444.7119 (2006): E9-E10. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; and deliberately fraudulent poured paintings made by other artists&lt;ref name="kate2006nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="physrevE"&gt;[ Jones-Smith, Katherine, Harsh Mathur, and Lawrence M. Krauss. "Drip paintings and fractal analysis." Physical Review E 79.4 (2009): 046111. ]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Jones-Smith and Mathur, labeling Pollock's paintings as "fractal" is meaningless, because the same characteristics are found in other non-fractal images. However, Taylor's rebuttal published in Nature&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"/&gt; showed that Taylor's group's fractal analysis could distinguish between Pollock paintings and the crude sketches, and identified further limitations in Jones-Smith and Mathur's analysis.

Jones-Smith and Mathur raised a valid concern applicable to all forms of fractal expressionism: are art works too small for the painted patterns to repeat over sufficient magnifications to assume the visual characteristics of fractals? In the case of Pollock paintings, the largest range used by Taylor et al. to determine each fractal parameter in a Pollock painting is less than two orders of magnitude in magnification. Nature's fractals repeat over limited magnification ranges (typically just over one order of magnitude), prompting scientists to debate what range is required to reliably establish fractal behavior.&lt;ref name="Ave/Man"&gt;[Avnir, David, Ofer Biham, Daniel M. Lidar, and Ofer Malcai. "Is the Geometry of Nature Fractal?" Science 279.5347 (1998): 39-40. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot refused to include a required magnification range in his definition of fractals and instead noted that it is the range necessary to generate the properties associated with fractal repetition. In the case of Pollock's work, this would be the magnification range necessary for the patterns to generate the fractal aesthetics. Neuroscience experiments have shown that this magnification range is less than two orders and that Pollock’s paintings do indeed induce the same physiological responses as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"/&gt; Mandelbrot concluded "I do believe that Pollocks are fractal."&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt;

At the time of the controversy, Coddington summarized as follows: “Fractal geometry has begun to play an important role in the authentication of the work of Jackson Pollock. We believe such analyses are necessary for pushing the field forward.”&lt;ref&gt;(J. Coddington et al, Proceedings SPIE, vol. 6810, 68100F 1-12, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent results, In 2015, by computer scientist Lior Shamir showed that, when combined with other pattern parameters, fractal analysis can be used to distinguish between real and imitation Pollocks with 93% accuracy. He found that the fractal parameters were the most powerful contributors to the detection accuracy&lt;ref&gt;L. Shamar, “What Makes a Pollock Pollock: A Machine Vision Approach”, International Journal of Arts and Technology, vol. 8, 1-10, (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The Planet Express crew visits [[Amy Wong|Amy]]'s parents, Leo and Inez, who are destroying the "old" [[Mars]] [[Las Vegas Strip|Vegas]] and constructing a more extravagant one.  A group of [[ecofeminism|eco-feminists]] (calling themselves "eco-feministas") led by Frida Waterfall protest the destruction of the environment, leading to an accident that leaves Frida's necklace lodged inside [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]]'s brain. The destruction upsets [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]], but Leo has bribed [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] to rubber stamp the project as environmentally friendly. Leela saves a Martian muck [[leech]], the last of its species, from the site.

In New Mars Vegas, Fry starts to go mad when he cannot stop hearing the thoughts of everyone around him. He meets Hutch, a [[Hobo|transient]] who advises Fry to wear a [[tin foil hat]] to keep others' thoughts out of his head. Hutch warns Fry never to reveal his powers and to beware the "Dark Ones".

While golfing with the crew, Leo reveals plans to build the universe's largest [[miniature golf]] course, destroying 12% of the Milky Way in the process. Farnsworth and the crew survey the site and discover an asteroid in a violet dwarf star system teeming with primordial life. Despite this, Farnsworth approves Leo’s project. Disgusted, Leela joins the eco-feminists, who begin sabotaging the project.

[[File:Into-the-wild-green-yonder-asteroid.JPG|thumb|left|The asteroid in the violet dwarf system.]]
Hutch introduces Fry to the "Legion of Mad Fellows", a [[secret society]] of tin-foil-hat-wearing telepaths led by the Number 9 man. No. 9 tells Fry a story of two species that worked together to survive, until one broke the cycle and caused an "evolutionary arms race", both species evolving to defeat the other. One became the extinct "Encyclopods" who evolved to preserve the [[DNA]] of endangered species so they could be restored should they become extinct. The other became the "Dark Ones", who want to destroy all life. Fry learns that the violet dwarf is the only surviving egg of the Encyclopods. Due to a resurgence in the life-giving force [[Qi|"Chi"]], the Encyclopod will soon be reborn. As Fry is immune to the Dark Ones' [[Psionics|psionic]] powers he alone can save it from Leo Wong's plans to turn it into a golf course, and from the Dark Ones, who have evolved to the point that no one knows what they look like.

To end the sabotage, Leo enlists [[Zapp Brannigan]] and [[Kif Kroker]], who in turn hire Bender to track down the eco-feministas. Fry infiltrates Leo's empire as a security guard. Amy is angered by her father's sexist jokes and joins Leela, while Bender bugs Fry's phone in case he communicates with Leela. Fry runs into Frida and has her take a message of support to Leela, but an unseen Dark One murders Frida.

Farnsworth prepares to close Planet Express; with their delivery team missing they cannot continue. Leo Wong hires them to put up a fence around the construction site. Farnsworth cancels the closing and goes with Zoidberg and Hermes to do the job. They are captured by the eco-feminists, who commandeer the Planet Express ship. When the eco-feministas suspect Fry of murdering Frida, Fry and Leela arrange a rendezvous. They are ambushed by the ''Nimbus'', which was tipped off by Bender. The eco-feministas are sent to prison.

At a Legion meeting, No. 9 explains that Fry must stop the implosion of the violet dwarf and thwart the Dark One who is sure to be present. Though no one knows the Dark One's form, its mind cannot be read, allowing Fry to identify it.  No. 9 gives Fry the Omega Device, which can temporarily disable the Dark One at close range.

Bender frees the eco-feministas from prison in order to uphold his record for most crimes committed at once. Hermes, Zoidberg, Scruffy, and a repentant Farnsworth rescue them.

At the ceremony, Fry cannot locate an unreadable mind; he concludes that he himself (having an unreadable mind) must be the Dark One. The eco-feministas disrupt the ceremony, but Fry convinces Leela to let him proceed. Fry activates the Omega Device, which creates a small dome around the two that appears to have no effect. Leela's leech falls to the ground and reveals itself as the final Dark One.  The violet dwarf system forms a giant [[sperm]] and flies into the star, creating an Encyclopod embryo which quickly matures, taking the form of a giant [[manta ray]]-like creature. The Dark One kills Hutch, whose dying act is to pull Frida's necklace out of Fry's forehead, causing Fry to lose his telepathy. The Encyclopod kills the Dark One. No. 9 convinces the Encyclopod to preserve the Dark One's DNA, but Zoidberg eats the remains before it can. The Encyclopod preserves Hutch's DNA before leaving.

Zapp attempts to apprehend the escaped prisoners, but the crew of the Planet Express ship and the Eco-feminists escape along with Kif.  Fry and Leela profess their love for each other as the ''Nimbus'' chases the Planet Express ship toward a [[wormhole]], which the Professor warns could take them trillions of [[light years]] away. Everyone agrees to go for it. Fry and Leela kiss as the ship enters the wormhole.

===Ending===
The ending refers to the uncertain future of the show. The makers were not sure if the show would return to TV, so if it did not, it is implied that the ship was in fact taken trillions of [[light years]] away. The show was picked up by [[Comedy Central]], and it is revealed in the next episode "[[Rebirth (Futurama)|Rebirth]]" that the wormhole sent the ship directly back to Earth.

==Continuity==
The film draws upon several major and minor running themes of the ''[[Futurama]]'' series. As in previous environmentally-minded episodes such as "[[The Problem with Popplers]]", "[[A Taste of Freedom]]" and "[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]", the Waterfall family makes an appearance, with Frida Waterfall reappearing along with a new member, Hutch (identifying himself as Frida's brother by removing her jewelry from Fry's head as Hutch dies), and in keeping with tradition both Frida and Hutch Waterfall meet an untimely end.&lt;ref name="DXC ITWGY" /&gt;  The Encyclopod's decision to preserve Hutch's DNA defines it as Hutch's successor and serves as a warning about the fragility of the existence of the human species.&lt;ref name="DXC ITWGY" /&gt; With dark matter [[Bender's Game|now useless as fuel]] the Planet Express ship has been modified to run on [[whale oil]], an alternative introduced in "[[Bendin' in the Wind]]".&lt;ref name="DXC ITWGY" /&gt;

Fry was originally frozen and [[The Why of Fry|brought to the future]] by [[Nibbler (Futurama)|Nibbler]] because a Nibblonian prophecy foresaw that he and his unique, Delta-wave-deficient mind (a consequence of him [[Roswell That Ends Well|being his own grandfather]]) would be required to save the universe.&lt;ref name="DXC TWOF"&gt;{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X|date=2003|title=Futurama season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "The Why of Fry"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Yonder'' Fry is once again appointed for such a task (though by the Legion of Mad Fellows instead of the Nibblonians), due to his immunity from the Dark Ones' psionic attacks.&lt;ref name="DXC ITWGY" /&gt;

The No. 9 man, a recurring background character throughout the series, is given a significant role in the film, though quite different from the role in the series for which he was originally conceived.&lt;ref name="MG ITWGY"&gt;{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2009|title=Futurama: Into The Wild Green Yonder commentary| medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Futurama-cast.png|thumb|right|This screenshot shows every character, at the time of the movie, from the ''[[Futurama]]'' series.]]

As [[fan service]], the climactic scene of the film features a scene with up to 200 characters on screen at once; most minor characters from Futurama's history can be seen (Unit 2013 appearing twice) with the exception of the children (like Dwight and Cubert), who were removed when the production team realized that [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Morbo|Morbo]] mentions that there are no children present. In the DVD commentary, producer [[David X. Cohen]] notes that [[Rough Draft Korea]], ''Futurama'''s overseas animation studio, charged a significant premium because of the difficulty of animating this scene.&lt;ref name="DXC ITWGY" /&gt;

In the final scene of the film, Amy and Kif are reunited [[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|after being estranged]]. After years of Fry trying to win her over, Leela finally returns Fry's love in full; Cohen notes that there was considerable debate among the ''Futurama'' writers about how to end the movie, and that ''Futurama'' creator [[Matt Groening]] himself pushed for the actual conclusion.&lt;ref name="DXC ITWGY" /&gt;

The film was initially intended to end the series. After ''Futurama'' was renewed, its creators were unsure if the storylines in the film would be continued. Groening stated that he wanted to ignore the film's ending and move on with the show. Cohen felt differently, stating that the revelations at the end should be resolved, even if the resolutions were brief, which they were in the premiere of the new season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.ign.com/articles/100/1007511p1.html IGN: SDCC 09: The Future of Futurama]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The ''Futurama'' staff began working on the film in 2006, and at two different points labor issues affected the production process. According to producer Lee Supercinski, the studio realized that they were going to receive the animatic of the film from [[Rough Draft Studios]] two weeks before the deadline for the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]]. As a result, the writers were forced to make revisions to the script without having completely reviewed the animatic; no writing was done during the strike.&lt;ref name="LS ITWGY"&gt;{{cite video | people=Supercinski, Lee|date=2009|title=Futurama: Into The Wild Green Yonder commentary| medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Futurama'' studio then received the colored film in June 2008, weeks before a proposed [[Screen Actors Guild#Predicted strike of 2009|Screen Actors Guild]] strike deadline, again forcing the writers to revise the script without completely reviewing the picture.&lt;ref name="LS ITWGY" /&gt;

Aware that ''Into the Wild Green Yonder'' could have been the final ''Futurama'' episode at the time of writing, the writers inserted numerous references to that fact. The title screen displays the message "The Humans Shall Not Defeat Us" in Alien Language 1; according to Cohen, the message is a defiant statement regarding the possible end of the series.&lt;ref name="Total Film"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/9-odd-things-we-now-know-about-futurama/page:5|title=Film features:  9 Odd Things We Now Know About ''Futurama''| author=White, James| date=2009-02-20| publisher=Totalfilm.com| accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Midway through the movie, a shot of the exterior of the Planet Express building draped with a banner reading "Going Out Of Business Forever! Again!" is shown, a reference to the original series' previous cancellation in 2003.&lt;ref name="DXC ITWGY" /&gt;  The scene where Professor Farnsworth removes Zoidberg's and Hermes's career chips and the countdown scene at the violet dwarf implosion ceremony both reference events from the pilot episode, "[[Space Pilot 3000]]" and also "[[The Cryonic Woman]]".&lt;ref name="DXC ITWGY" /&gt;  The cliffhanger nature of the final scene in the movie was devised so that it could conclude the series on an emotional note but also provide a point of departure for a series renewal, according to Cohen.&lt;ref name="IGN2"&gt;{{cite news| first = Patrick| last = Kolan| title = 'Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder' interview| url = http://dvd.ign.com/articles/959/959081p1.html| publisher = IGN.com| date = 2009-03-03| accessdate = 2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The script contains several detailed scientific references, such as the [[Rings of Saturn#Keeler Gap|Keeler Gap]] in the rings of Saturn, the asteroid [[2261 Keeler]] and the Keeler crater on Mars, all named after astronomer [[James Edward Keeler]].&lt;ref name="DXC ITWGY" /&gt;  In the movie the violet dwarf star is located at "[[Galactic coordinate system|galactic coordinates]] 167.84, -58.03, Mark 948", and Cohen mentions in the DVD commentary that the first two coordinates refer to another astronomical object.&lt;ref name="DXC ITWGY" /&gt;  In addition, the Martian muck leech is given the [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] ''Cyprinodon martius''.  Writer Ken Keeler adapted the name from ''[[Cyprinodon salinus]]'', the scientific name of the [[Death Valley pupfish]], which like the Martian muck leech lives in the desert and is nearly extinct.&lt;ref name="DXC ITWGY" /&gt;

The opening musical theme is a [[Frank Sinatra]]-style number sung by ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] as the Planet Express ship flies around the casinos of Mars Vegas.&lt;ref name="DXC ITWGY"/&gt;

===DVD===

The DVD features an audio commentary track, a storyboard animatic for Part 1 of the movie, and a collection of deleted scenes.  The Blu-ray also features a picture-in-picture version of the commentary.

==Reception==
Overall the film has received mixed reviews. Alynda Wheat of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a grade of B, saying that it catered to established fans.&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20259741,00.html|title=''Futurama'':  Into the Wild Green Yonder DVD Review|author=Wheat, Alynda|date=2009-02-18|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scott Collura of [[IGN]] rated the film itself 5/10, praising the use of both major and minor characters from the series and the science fiction content, but criticizing the film for being disjointed and for its "underwhelming climax" and concluding that it "never fully captures the greatness of the original series."  Collura rated the DVD 7/10, noting the high quality of the video transfer, the image detail and depth, and the use of surround sound and low-frequency effects.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/956/956729p1.html|title=''Futurama'':  Into the Wild Green Yonder Review|author=Collura, Scott|date=2009-02-08|publisher=ign.com|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin Liebman of Blu-ray.com rated the movie 2.5/5 and the Blu-ray release 3.5/5 overall. Liebman praised the film for its development of the primary characters in a way that would appeal to longtime fans and new viewers, but criticized the messy plot and haphazard pacing of the movie.  Liebman lauded the Blu-ray release for its crisp images, resolution of detail in the animation, lossless soundtrack and use of surround sound.&lt;ref name="blu-ray.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/movies.php?id=3160&amp;show=review|title=''Futurama'':  Into the Wild Green Yonder Blu-ray Review|author=Liebman, Martin|date=2009-02-25|publisher=blu-ray.com|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Kirkland of [[Sun Media Corporation]] wrote that the movie was "just as good as ''[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score|Bender's Big Score]]''", praising its send-ups of Las Vegas and science fiction themes and writing that it "nicely handles its environmental message with trenchant wit".&lt;ref name="Edmonton Sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/Entertainment/MovieNews/2009/02/27/8552201-sun.html|title=MovieNews - Bender and pals deliver the goods|author=Kirkland, Bruce|date=2009-02-27|publisher=Edmonton Sun|accessdate=2009-03-05}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeffrey Kauffman of DVD Talk rated the film four stars out of five, calling it "a fun and frenetic windup to a perhaps undervalued television gem".&lt;ref name="DVD Talk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/36463/futurama-into-the-wild-green-yonder/|title=Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder (Blu-ray)|author=Kauffman, Jeffrey|date=2009-03-01|publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition''''' is a [[1964 in literature|1964]] [[non-fiction]] book by British historian [[Frances A. Yates]].  The book delves into the history of [[Hermeticism]] and its influence upon [[Renaissance philosophy]] and [[Giordano Bruno]].

With the publication of ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'', Yates transformed [[Renaissance]] [[historiography]]. In it, she revealed the hermeticism with which the Renaissance was imbued, and the revived interest in mysticism, magic and [[Gnosticism]] of [[Late Antiquity]] that survived the [[Middle Ages]]. In the face of longstanding conventional interpretations, Yates suggested that the itinerant Catholic priest Giordano Bruno was [[Execution by burning|burned at the stake]] in 1600 for espousing the Hermetic tradition rather than his affirmation of [[heliocentricity]].

The book is cited by the bestselling British author [[Philip Pullman]], as a central inspiration for his own writing.&lt;ref&gt;http://falseeconomy.org.uk/blog/save-oxfordshire-libraries-speech-philip-pullman Pullman's speech on the future of Oxford libraries, January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

This page describe terms and [[jargon]] related to [[sculpture]] and sculpting.

__NOTOC__
{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}

==A==

=== armature ===
{{main article|armature (sculpture)}}
:An armature is an internal frame or skeleton which supports a [[#modeling|modelled]] sculpture. A typical armature for a small sculpture is made of heavy gauge wire, bent and twisted to form the basic shape. Often the armature is designed to leave one or more pins protruding from the base of the finished sculpture to facilitate attaching it to the [[#plinth|plinth]]

=== additive ===
:Is the process by which material is shaped and built up, frequently on an armature, to create the desired image.  Traditionally the material used in modeling clay, but plaster is considered a less desirable but also less expensive substitute.  Frequently the sculpture created by the additive method is a temporary one, used to create a more permanent version in stone or bronze.

=== assemblage ===
:An [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] is a sculpture constructed from [[#found object|found object]]s. Typically an assemblage does not disguise the original objects used, rather it either tries to show them in a new light, or forms a figurative sculpture from the collection of shapes.

== B ==

=== bozzetto ===
(Italian) A small terracotta sketch of a sculpture: see ''maquette''.

== C ==

=== carving ===
:Carving is one of the oldest sculptural techniques. It is a subtractive process; starting with a solid block, the sculptor removes material using [[chisel]]s and other tools to 'reveal' the finished form. Traditional carving materials include stone, especially [[marble]], and fine grained [[wood]]s.

=== casting ===
{{main article|casting}}
:Casting is a method of producing one or more copies of a sculpture. Typically, the original sculpture is [[#modelling|modelled]] as usual and covered with a [[#mould|moulding]] material which sets hard when dry. The mould is then separated to release the original sculpture. Once the mould is reassembled, at its most simple the casting material is poured into the void and left to set. Traditionally, molten [[bronze]] is used as the casting material, but modern alternatives include [[resin]]. When the cast sculpture has cooled, or cured, the mould is again separated to release it, and reassembled ready to cast the next copy. When molten bronze is used, it is more typical to use a [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax]] or similar process so that the finished piece is hollow rather than solid.
:The cast sculpture may then require some finishing work to remove mould lines and other imperfections.  The sculptor may also wish to [[#patina|patinate]] the work to produce the final piece....

=== Ciment Fondu ===
:'''Ciment Fondu''' is a proprietary product made by Kerneos (previously Lafarge Aluminates) for industrial use but widely adopted by sculptors.  It is a type of [[calcium aluminate cements|calcium aluminate cement]] used for constructing [[#mould|mould]]s or outdoor works. Typically Ciment Fondu needs to be used as a [[composite material]] reinforced with [[fibre glass]], building up the mould in series of layers. Fast setting, it achieves its full strength in 24 hours.

=== cold cast bronze ===
:A modern method of [[#casting|casting]] sculptures in which the casting material is a [[resin]] mixed with powdered  [[bronze]]. The finished sculpture has a surface which looks very similar to a traditionally cast [[bronze sculpture|bronze]] although it tends to be much lighter.

== D ==

=== direct carving ===
:Also referred to as ''taille directe''. A less planned approach to [[#carving|carving]] in which the sculptor carves the finished sculpture without using intermediate models or [[#maquette|maquette]]s. The sculptor typically works from memory, though some such as [[Cornellia Van A. Chapin]] would carve with a model in front of them.&lt;ref&gt;Sculptors’ Guild Travelling Exhibition, 1940-1941’’, Sculptors’ Guild, New York, New York, 1940 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice gained prominence in the early 20th century and, in some respects, was seen as a return to the direct approach used in [[primitive art]].

== H ==

=== Hydrocal ===
:Hydrocal is a [[US Gypsum]] product composed mainly of plaster of Paris and a small amount of Portland cement. Hydrocal, like its similar formulas Hydrostone, Ultracal, Duracal and others are all used for casting sculptures and other art objects as well as molds. Considerably harder and stronger than straight plaster of Paris, these products are for indoor use only as they rapidly degrade in the rain.

==I==

===indirect===
:Indirect carving "involves the use of previously prepared three dimensional models . . . .  usually assigned to a professional carver who, with the assistance of a pointing machine, proceeds to duplicate the model in stone.  During the latter half of the nineteenth century and extending into the first part of the twentieth virtually all stone sculpture was produced by the indirect method of carving."&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Jack C., ‘’The Materials and Methods of Sculpture’’, Dover Publications, New York, © 1947, 1974 edition p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

== K ==

=== kinetic sculpture ===
:[[Kinetic sculpture]] is sculpture which is designed to move. The movement can be driven by interaction with the viewer, or automatically using motors or air currents, as in the case of a [[mobile (sculpture)|mobile]].

== M ==
[[Image:Maquette ancient iran.jpg|right|thumb|Adobe Ceramic maquette model of a tower. Dated 13th century BCE. Excavated at [[Chogha Zanbil]], [[Iran]].]]

=== maquette ===
{{main article|Maquette}}
:A maquette is a small scale model for a finished sculpture. It is used to visualise and test shapes and ideas without incurring the cost and effort of producing a full scale sculpture. It is the analogue of the [[Painting|painter]]'s [[cartoon]] or [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]].
:For commissioned sculptures, especially monumental public sculptures, a maquette may be used to show the client how the finished work will fit in the proposed site.

=== modeling ===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Giacometti.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alberto Giacometti]] modeling in clay in preparation for casting a sculpture in bronze]] --&gt;
:Modeling is one of the most common techniques for sculpting. It is an additive process in which material is steadily built up to produce the finished figure. Unlike [[#carving|carving]], the sculptor often also has the option of correcting mistakes by removing or reshaping material. Modeling requires a [[malleable]] or plastic material which is later cured or fired to set it hard. Typical modeling materials include [[clay]], [[wax]], [[plaster]], and [[papier-mâché]].
:Frequently the modeling material has limited structural strength and will need the support of an [[#armature|armature]].

=== mould ===
:A mould is a reversed impression of a sculpture which is used to [[#casting|cast]] replica sculptures. The material used to construct the mould needs to accurately reproduce the surface detail of the original sculpture, while also being strong enough to keep its shape during casting and resilient enough to retain detail after multiple castings.
:Typical moulding materials include [[rubber]], especially [[latex]] rubber, [[plaster]] and composites such as ''[[#Ciment Fondu|ciment fondu]]''.

== P ==

=== papier-mâché ===
{{Main article|Papier-mâché}}  (often misspelled as '''{{sic|hide=y|paper-maché}}''')
:'''Papier-mâché''' is a construction material that consists of pieces of paper, sometimes reinforced with textiles, stuck together using a wet paste (e.g. glue, starch, or wallpaper adhesive). The crafted object becomes solid when the paste dries.

===patina===
{{main article|patina}} (also '''patinate''', '''patination''')
:A '''patina''' is a natural or applied surface finish to a sculpture piece.  Natural patinas may occur by [[oxidation]] due to long exposure to air or earth &amp;mdash; the most common of which is [[verdigris]] on [[copper]] or [[bronze]].  Artificial patinas can be created by application of chemical pastes or (below melting point) firing in a chemical [[atmosphere]].

=== plasticene ===
:{{Main article|Plasticene}}
:Plasticene is an oil-based clay used for modelling sculptures; its chief advantages over water clay is it does not shrink, crack or dry out and can be worked on over a long period of time.

=== plaster cast ===
:{{Main article|Plaster cast}}
:A plaster cast is a copy of a sculpture, which is [[#casting|cast]] in [[plaster]]. A plaster cast can accurately reproduce the details of the original sculpture, but is usually much less durable.  It is often used as a stage in the [[#casting|casting]] process.

=== pointing machine ===
:{{Main article|Pointing machine}}
:A '''pointing machine''' is used to accurately transfer measuring points from a model or maquette into stone or wood, in order to carve an accurate copy. This is called the indirect method of carving.

==R==

===roughing out===
:The process of carving out the basic shapes of a work before any detail is created.

== S ==

=== sand casting ===
:A method of [[#casting|casting]] typically used for casting [[iron]], in which the [[#mould|mould]] is constructed from compacted sand. By its nature, the mould can only be used once and needs to be reformed for each casting&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artenero.com.au/9_sandcasting/intoductionsand_1.html Sand casting explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

== T ==

===Taille directe===
See [[#direct carving|Direct carving]]

=== truth to materials ===
:A process or mode in [[#direct carving|direct carving]] in which the sculptor responds to the nature of the block being carved as much as the subject. Changes in colouration and imperfections revealed while carving the block are incorporated as features in the finished sculpture. Since the sculptor doesn't know in advance what imperfections will be revealed during the course of carving, a more flexible and fluid approach is required.

'''Green Thumb Theatre''' (also known as the '''Green Thumb Theatre for Young People''' and simply as '''Green Thumb''') is a Canadian children's [[theatre]] company based in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia that was founded by Dennis Foon and Jane Howard Baker in 1975.

'''Hâfiz Osman''' ({{lang-ota|حافظ عثمان}} [[Turkish language|Modern Turkish]]: ''Hâfız Osman'') (1642–1698) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[calligrapher]] noted for improving the script and for developing a layout template for the [[hilya|hilye]] which became the classical approach to page design.

==History==
Born Osman Den Ali, in [[Istanbul]], he was of [[Dervish]] origin and worked under the name of  Hâfiz Osman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://calligrapher.blogsome.com/2006/04/20/osman-effendi-hafiz-osman-1642-1698/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520044707/http://calligrapher.blogsome.com/2006/04/20/osman-effendi-hafiz-osman-1642-1698/ |archivedate=2009-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a muezzin at the Khassèki mosque, a position which afforded he and his family great protection.&lt;ref&gt; Huart, C., ''Les Calligraphes et les Miniaturistes de l'Orient Musulman''  1972, p. 148 [https://archive.org/details/lescalligraphes00huargoog Digital copy (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He became an accomplished calligrapher and was a tutor to the sultans [[Ahmed II]], [[Mustafa II]] and [[Ahmed III]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://calligrapher.wordpress.com/2007/05/07/hafiz-osman-b-istanbul-1642-d-istanbul-1698/|title=Hafiz Osman (b Istanbul, 1642; d Istanbul, 1698)|first1=Yusuf ibn Aiyyoub July|last1=17|first2=2009 at 9:36|last2=Pm|date=7 May 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was held in high esteem by the sultan [[Mustafa II]], who, according to legend often watched him work and held his inkwell as he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Huart, C., ''Les Calligraphes et les Miniaturistes de l'Orient Musulman''  1972, p. 148 [https://archive.org/details/lescalligraphes00huargoog Digital copy]&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his formal training with [[Suyolcuzade Mustafa Eyyubi]] and Derviş Ali.&lt;ref&gt;Suarez, M.F. and Woudhuysen, H.R. (eds), ''The Oxford companion to the Book,'' Volume 1, Oxford University Press, p. 776; M. Uğur Derman, ''Masterpieces of Ottoman Calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı Museum'', İstanbul, Sabancı Üniversitesi. pp. 82–83, {{ISBN|978-975-8362-45-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied ''nashk'' and ''sulus'' with Derviş Ali, and was certified by Suyolcuzade Mustafa Eyyubi.&lt;ref&gt;Kemal Çiçek, Ercüment Kuran, Nejat Göyünç, İlber Ortaylı, ''The Great Ottoman-Turkish Civilisation,'' Volume 3, Yeni Türkiye, 2000, n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Osman also admired the work of the 15th-century calligrapher, [[Seyh Hamdullah]], and spent many hours copying his works assiduously in order to perfect his craft.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J.R., ''Letters of Light: Arabic Script in Calligraphy, Print, and Digital Design'', Harvard University Press, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Osman revived some of the six scripts that had fallen into disuse. These scripts underwent a process of purification and became known as "Hâfiz Osman's style". The younger generation of calligraphers preferred this style, and it gradually replaced Hamdullah's style.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ugur Derman, "The Art of Calligraphy in the Ottoman Regime, in: Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu (ed.), ''History of Ottoman State and Civilisation'', II, Istanbul 2003, pp 645-652&lt;/ref&gt;

Osman was not only a fine calligrapher, but was also a master of layout. He raised text design to new heights, often incorporating different styles of calligraphy on the same page. His masterpiece is the Ottoman, ''[[Hilya|hilye]]''; a design template that includes eight distinct elements arranged aesthetically to provide for contemplative reflection and devotion. The elements are: ''Ba makan'' (prelude); ''Gobek'' (belly); ''Hilal'' (crescent); ''Ko'eler'' (corners); ''Ayak'' (verse); ''Etek'' (foot); ''Koltukar'' (alleys) and ''Pervaz'' (frame). His ''[[Hilya|hilye]]'' became the standard layout in the Ottoman world.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J.R., ''Letters of Light: Arabic Script in Calligraphy, Print, and Digital Design'', Harvard University Press, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;  

A ''hilye'' is a calligraphic panel containing a [[hadith]]-based text describing the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]'s physical appearance and attributes. Hâfiz Osman incorporated such texts, which had been popular for some time, in a formal design that soon became standard for this art form. ''Hilye'' came to be used as wall decorations or surface adornments, fulfilling much the same function as figurative paintings in other religious traditions. While containing a concrete and artistically appealing description of Prophet's appearance, they complied with the strictures against figurative depictions of the Prophet, leaving his appearance to the viewer's imagination.&lt;ref name="Peters2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=F. E. Peters|title=Jesus and Muhammad: Parallel Tracks, Parallel Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olEi-1LZYYQC&amp;pg=PA160|accessdate=5 November 2011|date=10 November 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974746-7|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hâfiz Osman also reinvigorated Hamdullah's tradition, in particular the re-introduction of a number of scripts that had fallen into disuse. Among his surviving works are copies of the [[Koran]] held at the [[Topkapi Palace]] Museum Library in Istanbul and the Nasser D. Khalili Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calligraphyqalam.com/people/hafiz-osman.html|title=CalligraphyQalam.com - Arabic, Ottoman &amp; Persian Calligraphy - Hafiz Osman|website=calligraphyqalam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volumes of the Koran produced by Osman were among the most highly sought-after in his time.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. Books: A Living History. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2011. p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

He gave lessons to the poor on Sundays and lessons to the wealthy on Wednesdays.&lt;ref&gt; Huart, C., ''Les Calligraphes et les Miniaturistes de l'Orient Musulman''  1972, p. 148 [https://archive.org/details/lescalligraphes00huargoog Digital copy]&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his lifetime, he trained a large number of calligraphers, of whom the finest was [[Yedikuleli Seyyid 'Abdullah Efendi]]. &lt;ref&gt;Uğur Derman, M., ''Letters in Gold: Ottoman Calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı Collection,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998 , p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Book Project''' (IBP) is a registered [[501 (c)|501 (c)(3) not-for-profit organization]], founded by Harriet Van Meter in 1966, which has sent more than 7 million [[books]] abroad. Its mission is to promote education and [[literacy]] while broadening Americans' understanding of their neighbors, which it achieves by annually sending more than 300,000 books to schools, libraries, churches, and [[Peace Corps]] volunteers throughout the developing world and in the United States.  The project is based in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], in a warehouse it has owned since 1983.

==History==
Harriet Drury Van Meter visited [[India]] in 1965 by invitation of the [[United States Department of State]]. While in India, she witnessed long lines of people waiting just to borrow a book to study from.  She returned to Kentucky and placed an inquiry in the English-speaking Indian newspaper ''[[The Hindu]]'', offering books.  A large number of people responded, so Harriet Van Meter started sending books from her basement.  In 1986, Harriet Van Meter was nominated for a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her efforts, and she was a finalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://askus.bloginky.com/2007/10/12/kentuckys-brush-with-nobelity/ Lexington Herald-Leader: Kentucky's brush with Nobelity]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Kentucky Educational Television]] aired the documentary ''Harriet Van Meter: A Life Extraordinary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ket.org/series/KHVAN/|title=Harriet Van Meter: A Life Extraordinary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Book Project has sent over 7 million books worldwide since 1966. The organization celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/tom-eblen/article42612801.html|title=Tom Eblen: Started in Lexington basement, International Book Project prepares to celebrate 50 years|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/opinion/op-ed/article100482437.html|title=50 years ago, one Lexington woman began a global outreach|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
By providing needed quality books to the people of the developing world, the International Book Project seeks:

*To promote education and literacy in developing countries and in areas of need within the United States
*To broaden Americans' understanding of their neighbors, and
*To foster global friendships and strengthen world unity

==Shipping Methods==
IBP sends books in the following ways:

*Small Shipment - 35-pound boxes of books, which can be sent to anyone in the developing world with a postal address
*Pallet - A pallet typically contains 700 - 1,000 books. It is often sent to organizations that need more books than a small shipment can provide, but do not need or have funding for a sea container.
*Sea Container - 20' or 40' containers that travel by sea, containing 10,000 - 40,000 books and can stock a University library or provide textbooks for an entire school district. 

===Volunteer Opportunities===
IBP was started when volunteers started sending books from Mrs. Van Meter's basement, and IBP still needs help. IBP is a small organization, a staff of five, with just four full-time employees. 

==Programs==
===Books Out===
''Books Out'' is a self-service program in which representatives from organizations abroad or in areas of need within the United States come to select books at the IBP warehouse and deliver them personally.

===Books as Bridges===
''Books as Bridges'' is an international pen-pal program which partners Central Kentucky classrooms with classrooms in developing countries around the world. Through shared artwork and letters of participants, the program encourages students to develop higher reading levels, cultural awareness, and international friendships. By fostering international friendships, Books as Bridges hopes to spark a passion for social change among Central Kentucky youth.

The classrooms in Central Kentucky receive cultural lessons about their partner classrooms.  In the developing world, the classrooms receive a box of books as an impetus to continue in the program.

==Peace Corps==
IBP often sends books to Peace Corps Volunteers.  In 1992, IBP was named "A Partner for Peace" by the US Peace Corps.

{{Culture of Bengal}}
'''Kalighat painting''' or '''Kalighat Pat''' originated in the 19th century [[Bengal]], in the vicinity of [[Kalighat Kali Temple]], [[Kalighat]], [[Kolkata]], [[India]], and from being items of souvenir taken by the visitors to the Kali temple, the paintings over a period of time developed as a distinct school of [[Indian painting]].  From the depiction of Hindu gods, [[Hindu goddess|god]], and other [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] characters, the Kalighat paintings developed to reflect a variety of themes.

==History==
[[File:The demon ravana fighting with the ape hanuman, 1880, kalighat school.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ravana]] and [[Hanuman]], Kalighat school of painting, c1880]]
[[File:Kalighat Ganesha in the lap of Parvati.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ganesha in the lap of Parvati]]
[[File:The goddess durga on her lion kills the demon mahishasura, 1880, kalighat school.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Durga]] and [[Mahishasura]], c.1880]]
In the nineteenth century, the only school of painting that was flourishing in Bengal was the traditional art of scroll paintings that was popular in the rural areas. These paintings were done on cloth or patas. They depicted conventional images of gods and goddesses and scenes from epics like Tulsidas’ Rama charita manas. The artists were villagers who travelled from place to place with their scroll paintings and sang the scenes from the epics depicted in the paintings during village gatherings and various festivals. These artists, called patuas or ‘painters on cloth’.

===The British: as patrons  this art===
[[File:Kalighat Temple, 1887.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Kalighat]], Kolkata- shown with the [[Kalighat Temple]] and the river, [[Adi Ganga]]]]
Meanwhile, the British, having established themselves in the country politically started to evince interest in art, literature, and music. They set up institutions that imparted a European style of academic training to Indian artists. The Calcutta School of Art was one such school and attracted traditional artists–the patuas—to the city.
Initially these artists were concentrated around the temple at Kalighat where there was a demand for religious art. Gradually, they started to learn from the newer techniques and discovered that these could help them increase their earnings. They started creating new forms of art and the Kalighat painting was born.

===Oriental and Occidental Kalighat===
The Kalighat School was an agreeable and unique blend of two different styles of painting—the Oriental and the Occidental—and steadily gained popularity. Among the deities that the Kalighat artists painted, the goddess Kali was a favorite. Images of Durga, Lakshmi, and Annapurna were also popular, especially during the Durga Puja festival. The artists also portrayed themes like Sita-Rama, Radha-Krishna and the exploits of Hanuman. 
Another theme depicted, dear to the Bengali ethos, was that of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and his disciples. But the Kalighat artists did not restrict themselves to religious themes. Their paintings depicting different professions and costumes were also popular with the tourists. Even contemporary events like crime were the subject of many paintings. The artists also chose to portray secular themes and personalities and in the process played a role in the Independence movement. They painted historic  characters like Rani Lakshmibai, and Duldul the famous horse of Imam Hussain of Karbala.

==Capturing Daily Life==

An important achievement of the Kalighat artistes was that they made simple paintings and drawings, which could easily be reproduced by lithography. Such prints were then hand coloured. This trend continued up to the early part of the twentieth century and these paintings ended up in museums and private collections. The charm of the Kalighat paintings lies in the fact that they captured the essence of daily life and they influence modern artistes like the late [[Jamini Roy]] even to this day.

The architectural firm of '''Kiehnel and Elliot''' was established in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], in 1906. The firm did substantial work in [[Florida]], and moved to [[Miami]] in 1922.&lt;ref name="histmiami"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://learningfrommiami.org/?p=1794 |title=Kiehnel &amp; Elliott: A Brief Survey of the Firm’s Miami Projects |publisher=Learning from Miami |accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926, it was known as '''Kiehnel, Elliot and Chalfant'''.&lt;ref name="allegheny"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alleghenywest.org/kiehnel-and-elliott/ |title=Kiehnel and Elliott |publisher=Allegheny West |accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Kiehnel''' (1870–1944) was the firm's senior partner. He was born in Germany and studied at the [[University of Breslau]] and the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris. Kiehnel's first commission in the Miami area was in 1917 and he opened the firm's Miami office in 1922.&lt;ref name="Kiehnel 1938"&gt;Kiehnel 1938&lt;/ref&gt;  He supervised the construction of El Jardin, the earliest known Mediterranean Revival work remaining in Miami.  Designing the mansion for John Bindley, President of the [[Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel|Pittsburgh Steel Company]], Kiehnel departed from the Mission style that had only recently made its appearance in Florida and provided an elaborate antiquity for the house by using aging techniques to get the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez 1982. p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patricios 1994. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Kiehnel introduced Mediterranean Revival to Pinellas County through his designs of the [[Rolyat Hotel]] in [[Gulfport, Florida]] (now part of [[Stetson College of Law]]) and the [[Snell Arcade]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].

Kiehnel advanced to Art Moderne styling in the Carlyle Hotel on Miami Beach and the 1924 Scottish Rite Masonic Temple on the Miami River, the first Art Deco building in the area.&lt;ref name="Patricios 1994. p. 176"&gt;Patricios 1994. p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; He also designed the [[Annie Russell Theatre]], a Romanesque Revival building on the campus of Rollins College in Winter Park.

Kiehnel was active in his profession. He was a member of the Pittsburgh chapter of the American Institute of Architects since 1906 and a member of the national body from 1913. He was a charter member of the Florida South chapter and its president in 1930-1931&lt;ref&gt;Kiehnel 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1935 to 1942 Kiehnel was the editor of Florida Architecture and Allied Arts magazine.

A number of Kiehnel's and the firm's works are listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miamishores&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=64000116}} |author=Maria Tempkin|date=September 1988|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Miami Shores Thematic Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurence Clark''' is a British stand-up comedian, writer, actor, presenter, and disability rights campaigner. Laurence was born with cerebral palsy and uses his line of work to alter the general public’s perceptions of disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Independent Blogs&amp;nbsp;– Laurence Clark|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/author/laurence-clark/|accessdate=13 December 2011|newspaper=The Independent|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stand-up comedy==
Laurence Clark topped [[Shortlist (magazine)|''Shortlist'' magazine]]'s poll of Britain’s Ten Funniest New Comedians in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

At the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference in 2005, Clark was called a 'sit-down comedian' by the then-Prime Minister's wife [[Cherie Blair]], referring to him being a wheelchair user. Clark shrugged off the press attention, saying she was just cracking a "crap joke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cherie cracks 'crap joke' for disabled comic|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/cherie-cracks-crap-joke-for-disabled-comic-1-1069927|accessdate=3 November 2014|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=28 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark gave his first live stand-up show, ''The All-Star Charity Show'', at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 2003. It was described by ''The Scotsman'' critic, [[Kate Copstick]], as a "powerful comedy voice" and "stunningly hard-hitting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/four_hot_weeks_in_august_1_662650|title=Four hot weeks in August|date=30 August 2003|work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a Critics' Choice in ''The Times''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Clark's next show, ''The Jim Davidson Guide to Equality'', was based upon comparisons between [[Jim Davidson]]'s stand-up and [[Tony Blair]]'s manifesto speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/laurence-clark-jim-davidson-guide-to-equality|publisher=Disability Arts Online|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A teenage experience of appearing on ''[[Jim'll Fix It]]'' with [[Jimmy Savile]]{{fact|date=October 2012}} provided the basis for ''Jim Fixed It for Me'', performed at the 2006 Edinburgh Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Review: Jim Fixed it for Me|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/laurence_clark_jim_fixed_it_for_me_1_1130578|accessdate=13 December 2011|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=14 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark's show at the 2007 Edinburgh Festival, ''12% Evil'', used video clips and Powerpoint slides to ridicule common clichés and stereotypes about disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disabled comedian debunks stereotypes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6924336.stm|accessdate=13 December 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=2 August 2007|first=Geoff|last=Adams-Spink}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Spastic Fantastic'' (2008), charted Clark's  mission, as someone who has cerebral palsy, to rescue the word ‘spastic’ through various means, including the use of secret cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/comedy_review_laurence_clark_spastic_fantastic_1_1086607|title=Comedy Review: Laurence Clark&amp;nbsp;– Spastic Fantastic!|date=19 August 2008|work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Health Hazard'' (2011), focused on the dangers of privatising the British National Health Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comedian Laurence Clark sounds a warning bell for the NHS|url=http://www.edinburgh-festivals.com/viewpreview.aspx?id=2424|newspaper=Scotsman|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He won a commission from the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad to produce a new show in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympic Diary: 50 weeks to go!|url=http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/sport/olympics_2012/news/9190150.Olympic_Diary__50_weeks_to_go_/|accessdate=13 December 2011|newspaper=Westmorland Gazette|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 25 and the 39th Tom Swift Sr. books are in the [[public domain]] all around the world and are available as downloadable texts from [[Project Gutenberg]].  However, in Canada, due to its life plus 50 years policy, and because [[Howard R. Garis]] and Thomas Moyston Mitchell died in 1962, on January 1, 2013 volumes 1 to 35 (written by Garis) and 39-40 (written by Mitchell) entered into the Canadian Public Domain. (Canadian Copyright Act, Sections 6.1 and 6.2)  This applies to other countries as well that have a life plus 50 policy.

[[File:Gersaint.jpg|thumb|[[Edme-François Gersaint]]'s shop, in [[Antoine Watteau]]'s ''[[L'Enseigne de Gersaint]]'', in form a shop sign, though never used as such.]]
A '''''marchand-mercier'''''&lt;ref&gt;The role of ''marchands-merciers'' was outlined by Louis Courajod in his edition of the day-book of [[Lazare Duvaux]] (1873), more firmly sketched by Pierre Verlet, "Le commerce des objets d'art et les marchands merciers à Paris au XVIIIe siècle", ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales'' '''13'''.1 (January/March 1958:10-29) and has been recently analyzed by Carolyn Sargentson, ''Merchants and Luxury Markets: The Marchands Merciers of Eighteenth-Century Paris'' (Victoria and Albert Museum) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[French language|French]] term for a type of entrepreneur working outside the [[guild]] system of craftsmen but carefully constrained by the regulations of a ''corporation'' under rules codified in 1613.&lt;ref&gt;The rules were confirmed, without change, in August 1643 and were maintained until the Revolution: [[Daniel Roche (historian)|Daniel Roche]],  (tr. [[Arthur Goldhammer]]) , ''France in the Enlightenment'' (1993) 1998
Cambridge, Mass, and London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduplicative term&lt;ref&gt;"Par un pléonasme, qui paraît presque volontaire, ils s'appelaient ''marchands-merciers'', ''mercatores-mercatores''" (Verlet 1958:10)&lt;/ref&gt; literally means a merchant of merchandise, but in the 18th century took the connotation of a merchant of ''[[Objet d'art|objets d'art]]''.  Earliest references to this ''Corps de la Ville de Paris'' can be found at the close of the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Joanny, ''Régistre des délibérations et ordonnances des marchands-merciers de Paris 1596-1696'' (Paris) 1878, noted in Verlet 1958:10 note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but in the 18th century marchands-merciers were shopkeepers but they also played an important role in the decoration of Paris homes. In fact, they served as general contractors, designing and commissioning pieces of the most fashionable furniture, and often, in addition, worked outside of their shops as [[interior decorator]]s, responsible for many aspects of a room's decor. In Paris, the guild system, in place since the late Middle Ages, prohibited craftsmen from working with any material with which they had not undergone a formal [[apprenticeship]]. Only a marchand-mercier who worked outside of the guild system, therefore, could mount Chinese [[porcelain]]s with gilt-bronze handles and stands, fit the [[cabinetmaker]]'s furniture with Japanese [[lacquer]] or [[Sèvres porcelain]] plaques, and supply furniture with opulent gilt-bronze (or [[ormolu]]) mounts.&lt;ref&gt;There were certain cabinetmakers who, by license of the king, could overcome by patent their status as non- Parisian "foreigners" and work outside of the strictly limiting  guild system, ''suivant le Cour", "following the Court".&lt;/ref&gt;

The general lines permitted to their ''métier'' were set out under Charles IX, in 1570, as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Wholesale merchants, drapers and jewelers, in such way that under this status of wholesaler (''estat de grossier'') have been included at all times the merchants of [[cloth of gold]], of silver, of silk... [[Tapestry|tapestries]], jewellery, spiced goods, textiles, hammered copper, silk thread, hardware and the like, of which it is not permitted to have any manufacture whatsoever, but only to sell, buy, display, bedeck and beautify all kinds of merchandise"&lt;ref&gt;"marchans&lt;!--marchans in original--&gt; grossiers, merciers et jouailliers, de manière que soubs cet estat de grossier ont esté comprins&lt;!--comprins in original--&gt; de tout temps les marchans de drap d'or, d'argent, de soie... tapisseries, jouailleries, espiceries, merceries, cuivres de forge, fil de soye, quinqualleries, et autres semblables, auxquels il n'est permis de faire manufactures quelconque, mais seulement de vendre, achepter, estaller, parer et enjolliver de toutes espèces de marchandise"; quoted in Verlet 1958:11.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus the ''marchands-merciers'' were characterised in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' as "sellers of everything, makers of nothing"".&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire des sciences'',... ("Neuchâtel", 1765) vol. 10:360, noted in Verlet 1958:11 note 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Savary des Bruslons]] elaborated this lapidary remark and revealed the disdain of his generation towards handcrafts: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This Corporation is considered the noblest and most excellent of all the Corporations of Merchants, all the more because those who compose it do not labour at all and make no handiwork, if it were not to beautify those things that are already made and manufactured"&lt;ref&gt;''"Ce Corps est consideré comme le plus noble et les plus excellent de tous de les Corps des Marchands, d'autant que ceux qui le composent ne travaillent point et ne font aucun ouvrage de la main, si ce n'est pour enjoliver les choses qui se sont déjà faîtes et fabriquées''", Savary, ''Dictionnaire universel du commerce...'' 1761, quoted in Verlet 1958:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though they were confined by law to no narrow specialisation, the Parisian ''marchands-merciers'' followed narrow fields— Savary distinguished twenty— following the usages of their training and their connections, in highly competitive fields dominated by fashion. Among them a small group of ''marchands-merciers'' specialised in works of art, catering to an elite circle of connoisseurs and collectors towards the middle of the 18th century, when a vogue for exoticism expressed itself in ''[[chinoiserie]]''.  Savary's ''Dictionnaire'' detailed the wares of:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"those who sell pictures, prints, candelabras, wall-lights, girandoles of gilded brass and [patinated] bronze, crystal chandeliers, figures of bronze, marble, wood and other material; cabinets, coffers, armoires, table, little tables, and candlestands put together of wood and gilded, marble tables and other merchandise and curiosities proper for the ornament of lodgings." &lt;ref&gt;"''ceux qui vendent des tableaux, des estampes, des candelabras, des bras, des girandoles de cuivre doré et de bronze, des lustres de cristal, les figures de bronze, de marbre, de bois et d'autre matière, des pendules, horloges et montres; des cabinets, coffres, armoires, tables, tablettes, et gueridons de bois de raport et doré, des tables de marbre et autre marchandises et curiosités propres pour l'ornement des appartemens''"; quoted in Verlet 1958:14f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These entrepreneurs helped guide and even create fashions, such as that for Chinese porcelains, mounted in purely French [[gilt bronze]], transforming a vase into a [[ewer]] with rococo lip and handle, or reversing one bowl over another, with an open-work gilt-bronze rim, to function as a perfume-burner. Only a ''marchand-mercier'' could marshal the resources required to create such objects.&lt;ref&gt;"In the compartmentalization imposed by the guild system, the merchants were the only ones who could coordinate the lasbour of various trades (Verlet 1958:18).&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Marchands-merciers'' bought Japanese lacquer screens and boxes, had them dismantled and their wooden backing shaved down, then commissioned ''[[ébéniste]]s'' like [[Bernard II Vanrisamberg]] or [[Joseph Baumhauer]] to produce furniture veneered with exotic lacquer panels shaped to fit the complex curves of Louis XV surfaces, and perhaps completed with French imitations, or entirely japanned in [[Vernis Martin]], which might imitate Chinese blue and white porcelain decors, such as the blue-on-white ensemble of furniture Hébert delivered in 1743 for [[Louise Julie de Mailly|Mme de Mailly]]&lt;ref&gt;Verlet 1958:18, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the ''marchands-merciers'' on French porcelain is also considerable. [[Lazare Duvaux]] alone bought three-fifths of the ''total output'' of Sèvres in 1757, representing a total of 165,876 ''livres''.&lt;ref&gt;Verlet 1958:19.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain forms in the Sèvres archives carry the names of well-known ''marchands-merciers'' in their designations.

Membership in the ''corps'' was carefully controlled. A new member, born in France, had to undergo an [[apprenticeship]] of three years, followed by another three as a ''compagnon'', during which time he was bound to remain unmarried. His master could take on but one apprentice at a time, and the apprenticeships were duly enregistred at the corporation's offices in rue du Petit-Lion (rue Quincampoix). A sum changed hands, estimated by Guillaume Glorieux as averaging about 1720  500 or 600 ''livres'', and a larger sum was owed to the ''corporation'' when the individual was received master (''maîtris''), some 1700 ''livres''.&lt;ref&gt;Glorieux, ''À l'Enseigne de Gersaint: Edme-François Gersaint, marchand d'art sur le Pont Notre-Dame'', Paris, 2002:23, 136, 140; Glorieux's immediate context is the apprenticeship contract of [[Edme-François Gersaint]] in 1716; he discusses the ''corps des marchands merciers'' pp 136ff.&lt;/ref&gt; There were two exceptions to this rule, made for purveyors to the Court— ''marchands privilégié suivant le cour''— by decree of the king, and for those who married the daughter of one of the accredited merchants.

The Parisian ''marchands-merciers'' congregated in [[rue Saint-Honoré]], marking their establishments with catchy and amusing signs; there could be found the premises of Hébert, [[Simon-Philippe Poirier]]— and later at the same premises ''at the sign of the Golden Crown'' his partner [[Dominique Daguerre]] and Martin-Eloi Lignereux— Mme Dulac, Julliot, Lebrun ''at the King of the Indies'' and Tuard ''au [[château de Bellevue]]''. Nearby, in rue de la Monnaie, the street where the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|manufacture royale of Sèvres]] eventually chose to open its porcelain shop, were Darnault, father and son, at the ''sign of the King of Spain'', and [[Lazare Duvaux]]. Edme-François Gersaint, for whom [[Watteau]] painted ''[[L'Enseigne de Gersaint]]'' as a [[shop sign]] had premises, following an old tradition, in a house on the [[Pont Notre-Dame]]. There, he advertised in  1740, he
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Sells all sorts of new and tasteful hardware (''Cainquaillerie''), trinkets, mirrors, cabinet pictures,&lt;ref&gt;''Peintures de cabinet'' connote small, intimately scaled, highly finished paintings suited for appreciation in a private [[Cabinet (room)|cabinet]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''pagods'',&lt;ref&gt;A generic term for Far Eastern figures, rather than [[pagoda]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; lacquer and porcelain from Japan, shellwork and other specimens of natural history, stones, agates, and generally all curious and exotic merchandise".&lt;ref&gt;"''Vend toute sort de clainquaillerie&lt;!--clainquaillerie in original--&gt; nouvelle et de goût, bijoux, glaces, tableaux de cabinet, pagodes, vernis et porcelaines du Japon, coquillages et autres morceaux d'histoire naturelle, cailloux, agathes, et généralement toutes marchandises curieuses et étrangères"''; quoted in Verlet 1958:16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A newcomer, Granchet, opened premises ''Au petit Dunkerque'', in the Left Bank, Quai Conti at the far end of the [[Pont Neuf]].&lt;ref&gt;These locations are given in Verlet 1958:15&lt;/ref&gt;

Among these entrepreneurial dealers and [[interior decorator]]s at the apex of their profession, towards the middle of the century Hébert achieved the greatest celebrity,&lt;ref&gt;So suggests Verlet 1958:13ff.&lt;/ref&gt; appearing in the popular novel ''Thémidore'' (1745) and marrying his daughter to the son of the [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1731–1767)|Dauphine]]'s first ''femme de chambre'' in 1751, in a contract signed at Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;And noted in his ''Mémoires'' by the [[Charles Philippe d'Albert de Luynes|duc de Luynes]], observing that she was likely to bring him ''beaucoup de bien'' (noted by Verlet 1958:13).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micah D. Fowler''' (born March 5, 1998) is an American actor with [[cerebral palsy]]. He is most known for his roles in ''[[Labor Day (film)|Labor Day]]'' and as JJ DiMeo in the television series ''[[Speechless (TV series)|Speechless]]''.&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/20/speechless-micah-fowler-breakout-star|author=Dalene Rovenstine|title=Speechless: Micah Fowler is the breakout star|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=September 20, 2016|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler has also had minor roles in ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]''.

==Early life==
The younger brother of actress [[Kelsey Fowler]], he grew up in [[Barnegat Township, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="sand"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barnegat Teen May Be Breakout Star of Fall TV Season|url=http://thesandpaper.villagesoup.com/p/barnegat-teen-may-be-breakout-star-of-fall-tv-season/1572315|website=The SandPaper|accessdate=October 8, 2016|date=Sep 13, 2016|quote=Now a local teen has a chance to make it big on television. Barnegat's Micah Fowler – Kelsey's younger brother – will make his national TV debut at 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 21 in a new ABC show called "Speechless."}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up performing in local theater productions along with his sister. After his sister started taking roles on Broadway, Fowler thought he might like to advance his acting career as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Micah Fowler Biography|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5094896/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|website=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Micah D. Fowler started pursuing acting at the age of 5, which led him to roles on ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]''. He booked his role for ''[[Labor Day]]'' at age thirteen. For his most recent role, as "JJ DiMeo" on ''[[Speechless (TV series)|Speechless]]'', he found out he booked the role on his eighteenth birthday. In an interview with ''[[People magazine]]'', Fowler said it was the "best birthday present ever!"&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Brittany|title=Speechless Star Micah Fowler Opens Up About Thriving with Cerebral Palsy: 'I Don’t Let It Define Me'|url=http://people.com/celebrity/speechless-micah-fowler-opens-up-thriving-cerebral-palsy/|website=People}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his role on ''Speechless'', he said it is a challenge to play JJ. Although Fowler is able to speak, the JJ character does not speak, so Fowler has to compensate with dramatic facial expressions and body movements. It's said that Fowler's humor gets the show's biggest laughs.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; He said he sometimes just wants to blurt out what he is feeling or saying.&lt;ref name="people" /&gt;

Fowler and the character he portrays both have cerebral palsy, and he is one of few actors with a disability playing a character with a disability on primetime network television.&lt;ref name="bzf"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lange|first1=Ariane|title=Meet The Teen Who’s Casually Making Sitcom History|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/micah-fowler-speechless-abc|website=Buzzfeed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambassador for the Cerebral Palsy Foundation==
When not performing, Fowler devotes his time as an ambassador for the [[Cerebral Palsy Foundation]] (CPF). After each episode of ''Speechless'', the CPF's website posts content and short informational videos about cerebral palsy. Fowler encourages, "So the next time you watch ''Speechless'', take 10 minutes to check out their post for the night."&lt;ref name="people" /&gt;

==Personal life==
When taking the role for ''Speechless'', Fowler had to move from New Jersey to Los Angeles. To take the role, he sacrificed by missing much of his sled hockey season and much of his senior year. He plans to attend his graduation ceremony in the spring.&lt;ref name="bzf" /&gt;

While Fowler had previously been somewhat averse to social media, after landing the role on ''Speechless'', he did join Instagram and Twitter in an effort to promote the show.

Growing up he said he was a huge fan of movies and television. He said, "I couldn't help but notice the lack of characters dealing with disabilities."&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; He hopes to be in a ''[[Star Wars]]'' film or a Marvel movie.&lt;ref name="bzf" /&gt;

She began her live-action film-directing career with ''L'Homme à tout faire'' (1980), nominated for best direction and for best film at the Canadian Film Awards in 1981. This success was followed by ''[[Sonatine (1984 film)|Sonatine]]'' (1984), which launched the career of [[Pascale Bussières]] and won both the Genie for best direction at the Canadian Film Awards and the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival.&lt;ref name="TIFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tiff.net/CANADIANFILMENCYCLOPEDIA/content/films/sonatine |title=Canadian Film Encyclopedia: Sonatine |accessdate=2013-10-31 |work=TIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103091454/http://tiff.net/CANADIANFILMENCYCLOPEDIA/content/films/sonatine |archivedate=November 3, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music on hold''' ('''MOH''') is the business practice of playing recorded [[music]] to fill the silence that would be heard by [[telephone]] callers who have been placed [[Hold (telephone)|on hold]].  It is especially common in situations involving [[customer service]].

Music on hold is sometimes referred to as phone on hold, message on hold, on hold messaging, or hold music.

==Development==
Music on hold was created by Alfred Levy, an inventor, factory owner, and entrepreneur. In 1962, Levy discovered a problem with the phone lines at his factory. He discovered that a loose wire was touching a metal girder on the building. This made the building a giant receiver so that the audio broadcast signal from a radio station next door would transmit through the loose wire and could be heard when calls were put on hold.&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web|url=http://callsonhold.com/recognition.htm|title=Smithsonian recognizes Music on Hold. |publisher=CallsonHold.com |date=2005-01-01 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy patented his work in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=PZ9lAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Google Patent for Telephone Hold Program System  |publisher=google.com/patents |date=2013-07-06 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other advancements have come to change and enhance the technology, it was this initial patent creation that began the evolution for today's music on hold.

==Equipment and formats==
Most MOH systems are integrated into a telephone system designed for businesses via an [[jack (connector)|audio jack]] on the [[telephone]] equipment labeled "MOH". There are also some units with built-in message on hold capabilities and units designed for small businesses without an extensive phone system.

Today, equipment that supports physical media usually plays [[Compact disk|CDs]]. Some older systems may still use [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tapes]] (sometimes employing endless-loops), or [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape players. In each case, the unit loads the media into a digital memory chip to prevent premature wearing of the mechanical parts.

Equipment that supports virtual media generally plays [[MP3]] files. Several types of units play these files. [[USB Flash Drive]] units allow an MP3 file to be received electronically, downloaded to a flash drive and connected to the player. Ethernet based remote load units connect via the network to a remote IP address. Phone line based remote load systems allow for a connection via an analog telephone line and dialing the number belonging to the unit.  For [[Voice over internet protocol|VoIP]] phone systems, MP3s are loaded without any equipment.

Newer technology allows MP3 files to be downloaded automatically from the internet so that messages (or interesting content in the form of news and weather, amongst many) can be changed daily. The new "online on hold" technology makes the older technology redundant since it requires no additional hardware.  All these systems allow analog-to-digital audio storage and playback.

As of 2011 allow productions to be downloaded via the Internet or played through a USB flash drive. This allows for larger files and higher quality formats. Grace Digital manufactures internet radio devices that play streaming content (see Recent Trends, below).

==Consumer perceptions==
A number of studies have been conducted, which highlight consumer perceptions of music on hold, reinforcing its use by businesses to improve standards of call handling.

A survey of more than 2,000 UK consumers commissioned by audio branding specialist [[PHMG (company)]] revealed 70% of consumers are put on hold for more than 50% of their calls. When put on hold, 73% of callers want to hear something other than beeps or silence.&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web|url=http://www.freshbusinessthinking.com/news.php?NID=14476&amp;Title=Seventy+per+cent+of+consumers+put+on+hold+for+longer+than+a+minute |title=Seventy per cent of consumers put on hold for longer than a minute |publisher=freshbusinessthinking.com |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web|url=http://www.smallbusiness.co.uk/channels/sales-and-marketing/news/2110543/customers-perennially-on-hold.thtml |title=Customers perennially on hold |publisher=smallbusiness.co.uk |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CNN survey found that 70 percent of callers in the United States who hold the line in silence hang up within 60 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://work.chron.com/importance-onhold-messages-4665.html |title=The Importance of On-Hold Messages |author=Anna Assad |publisher=Houston Chronicle |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, research by North American Telecom found callers hearing music on hold will stay on the line 30 seconds longer than callers experiencing silence.

==Source of music==

===Radio===
The musical source may be as simple as playing a local [[radio station]] through the MOH jack.  This is unlawful without the express permission of the music title and mechanical copyright holders.
* Although radio stations may provide the desired [[List of music radio formats|musical format]], there is no control over the specific songs that are played, some of which may be offensive to the callers, or depending on the music played, sound harsh in [[monaural]] sound. This kind of system is also vulnerable to interference.
* Radio stations typically do not [[license]] their music for MOH systems.  In the United States, the radio broadcaster has no legal right to provide such a license as they, themselves, obtain a usage license from the music title owner for the right to broadcast said music for limited and personal use.  As mentioned below, re-broadcasting of a radio program over a phone system may likely cause licensing and [[copyright]] problems for the owner of the MOH system.
* Most radio stations (excluding those that are part of [[non-commercial educational]] radio networks) will play [[advertising|commercials]], which may be offensive or at least annoying to the caller.  Furthermore, it is possible that a [[competition|competitor's]] commercial may be played, which would be counter-productive.

:See ''[[#Legal aspects|Legal aspects]]''.

Owners of radio stations will usually air their broadcast signal as music on hold, using their main program signal, if there are several.  Examples include [[RÚV]] from [[Iceland]] using [[Rás 1]] as the on-hold music.

===Off-the-shelf commercial CDs===
{{main article|Commercial off-the-shelf}}

Commercial CDs eliminate the problems encountered with radio commercials, and they offer control over the selection of music; they do not, however, grant proper license for MOH use unless users first obtain permission from the song title copyright owner (when the song is not in the "public domain") and the mechanical copyright owner. (See "Radio," above, for more details.)

===Stock MOH CDs (with or without voice-overs)===
CDs are available that have been specifically recorded and licensed for MOH systems.  These may contain only music, or may include periodic [[voice-over]]s with messages such as "Your call is important" or "Please stay on the line".  Such off-the-shelf recordings may be generic or may be specific to individual industries, but will not be customized for individual companies.

===Custom-designed MOH===
In general, custom music on hold is advised to:
#Control content
#Control music genre
#Use the on hold time to sell to a captive audience
#Through a reputable on hold company be fully licensed and legal for on hold playback
#Reduce hang-ups and make the business look more professional
#Control length of programming based on average caller holdtime

CDs (or other MOH formats, such as MP3 files) can be custom-created to suit the particular needs of a business.  The announcements can be scripted to emphasize particular attributes of the business such as location, store hours, or special promotions or services. These are typically used for up-selling and cross-selling callers. Companies can either record the messages themselves, or hire a music on hold production company.

===Online on hold===
A program loaded onto an existing computer and connected to the phone system can allow automatic content updates interspersed with company information.

===Streaming MOH===
Streaming MOH refers to a live music on hold stream (URL-based delivery) which can also include custom content. Streams in http .mp3 format include those provided by easyonhold.com. Streaming MOH can also refer to a streaming media server, as with Cisco Unified Call Manager, in which case RTP format is utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cisco Unified Communications SRND Based on Cisco Unified CallManager 4.x - Music on Hold  [Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CallManager)] - Cisco Systems|url = http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/srnd/4x/42moh.html#wp1043752|website = www.cisco.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free on-hold programs===
Programs available to non-profit organizations at no cost. Very few companies offer absolutely free programs. The programs are available in generic and custom formats, and are delivered at no cost to the requesting organization.

==Styles of music==
The style of music played by MOH systems depends largely on the type of business offering the service.  It is generally best to present music that will not be offensive to the audience, but that would also be of particular interest to the typical caller. A western apparel store may choose to play [[country music]]. A Christian book store may choose to play popular [[Christian music]]. A university may choose to play [[European classical music|classical music]]. An athletic ticket office may choose to play the team or school's [[fight song]]. Light classics, [[smooth jazz]], and [[beautiful music]] are common choices, as is fully [[synthesizer|synthesized]] melodic music.

The most common MOH is "Opus Number One", which is on "65 million Cisco phone sets worldwide as the default hold music," according to a ''This American Life'' podcast (number 516). The composer, Tim Carleton, recorded the song in 1989 on a four-track tape recorder with Darrick Deel. When Deel, who works at Cisco, told Carleton their song could be the default music on hold, Carleton also approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glass|first=Ira|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/516/stuck-in-the-middle|publisher=This American Life|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent trends==
With the application of newer equipment, music on hold devices can now interact with the caller. No additional programs are required on the platform, as all the logic is done with the MoH device. This can include services such as 'polling on hold', rating your customer service officer anonymously, etc. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The trend toward hosted IP telephony for business phone systems is demanding changes in music on hold message technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Tom|title=The IP Transition: Starting Now|journal=FCC Blog|date=November 19, 2013|pages=1|url=http://www.fcc.gov/blog/ip-transition-starting-now}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, 2013, EasyOnHold.com introduced custom messages on hold streams for use with [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk]] and OnSIP phone systems.

==Legal aspects==

===Copyright law===
In the US, and other countries where [[copyright law]]s are practiced, authors are granted copyright protection on their musical compositions. Such copyright protection has existed since just after the turn of the 20th century and most music written prior to 1900-1910 - from impressionism back to baroque and antiquity are said to be  "in the [[public domain]]." Use of any said music prior to the creation of these copyright laws may be presumed to be free for use by all - although individual titles may have been later copyrighted through a change in the composition or arrangement. The use of copyrighted music is not for free use in the public domain.

All music written after this period, which is copyrighted under multiple acts of congress, are owned by the author(s) or their assignees.  The use of this music is protected and controlled in order that the owner may derive usage income. Specific to telephonic MOH (music-on-hold), the US laws currently protect the copyright owners from unlawful, unpermitted use of their music titles in over-the-phone broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soundcommunication.holdcom.com/bid/96828/Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-Music-Licensing |title=Everything You Need To Know About Music Licensing |author=J. Durante |publisher=Sound Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any person or business wishing to use current, popular, post 1900-1910, copyrighted music for MOH purposes may only lawfully do so by obtaining permission from the owner.  Currently, performance rights societies such as ASCAP, BMI and SESAC will sell blanket permission to use music titles in their catalog for MOH purposes—for an express annual fee - calculated by size and frequency of usage. Failure to obtain this paid permission is a violation of US copyright laws.

This same copyright protection is also true in the rebroadcast of any radio program. As mentioned earlier, the broadcaster has been assigned a narrow and specific usage license to air copyrighted song titles. This does not include permission to any person or business to re-broadcast that program on telephonic MOH. The broadcaster may not promote such unlawful use and is not an owner who has any lawful right to grant MOH usage permission. They do not hold the ownership of the title and have no right to license use in any way. Those who plug radio broadcast into their telephone MOH without first obtaining paid permission through the owner's agents (ASCAP, BMI or SESAC) may be in violation of copyright law and may be prosecuted under existing federal laws.

===Mechanical copyright===
A second copyright exists when it comes to licensing use for telephonic MOH. A piece of music, as mentioned above, is copyrighted and may be licensed for use as a music title and is understood to be a combination of melody, harmony and, where applicable, lyrics.  However, neither radio listeners nor MOH listeners could hear this music unless it was recorded - providing a delivery medium whereby the "music" becomes a "performance."  As mentioned elsewhere, in countries such as the US, where said copyright laws are enforced, nearly every recording of a song title holds its own "mechanical copyright."

For most of the 20th century, music was recorded in studios, produced by record company executives, producers, arrangers and engineers who were hired to deliver the artist's finished recordings for mastering and duplication - for sale on the varied media: 78, 45 and 33 RPM vinyl, reel-to-reel, 8-track tape, cassette and [[compact disc]].  To protect their investment, the record companies obtain a mechanical copyright in order to protect and control the recording with which they derive usage and sales income.  (For those still uncertain of the difference between "song title" and "mechanical" copyrights,  consider the Capitol Records lawsuit for copyright infringement against Nike some 20 years ago.  Nike legally obtained permission to use the Beatles song title "Revolution" from the title's owner, Michael Jackson. They used the Capitol Records owned recording of the Beatles' performance, but failed to obtain and pay for permission and use.  Capitol Records sued and prevailed because Nike ONLY had a license to use the title and did not have a license to use the mechanical recording.)

Therefore, persons or businesses wishing to play music that falls "in the public domain" are still legally required to obtain permission to use the mechanical recording of this music, from the mechanical copyright holder.'''  '''And where the use is of copyrighted music, the same applies.  In all cases, before a song title may be broadcast on a telephone MOH, said use must be approved and licensed from BOTH the "song title" copyright owner (if it is NOT in public domain) and the "mechanical" copyright owner. '''

===Enforcement===
It is generally known within the on-hold industry that some performance rights societies, with regional offices and staff, both monitor and prosecute persons and businesses that infringe on the copyright of title holders in their libraries. [[ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] are both aggressive about this, from time to time. It is not known whether any record companies are currently or actively monitoring and prosecuting violators of their mechanical license.

'''Nutcracker dolls''', also known as '''Christmas nutcrackers''', are decorative [[nutcracker]] figurines most commonly made to resemble a [[toy soldier]]. In German tradition, the dolls are symbols of good luck, scaring away bad spirits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/holidays/2010/12/in_a_nutshell.html|title=In a Nutshell|last=Malone|first=Noreen|date=2010-12-16|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://australianballet.com.au/behind-ballet/the-nutcracker-doll-a-history|title=The nutcracker doll: a history {{!}} The Australian Ballet|website=australianballet.com.au|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Nussknackermuseum 002.jpg|thumb|left|Original nutcracker dolls from [[Nussknacker Museum]] in [[Neuhausen, Saxony]]]]
Nutcracker dolls originate from late-17th century Germany, particularly the [[Ore Mountains]] (German: ''Erzgebirge'') region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One origin story attributes the creation of the first nutcracker doll to a craftsman from [[Seiffen]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They were often given as gifts, and at some point they became associated with [[Christmas]] season. They grew in popularity around the 19th century and spread to nearby European countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As the demand grew, nutcracker doll production also began on a mass scale in factories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; {{ill|Friedrich Wilhelm Füchtner|de}} (1844–1923), commonly known in Germany as "father of the nutcracker", began the first mass production of the design (using a [[lathe]]) at his workshop in [[Seiffen]] in [[Saxony]] during 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutcrackermuseum.com/history.htm|title=NM The History of Nutcrackers ~ Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum|website=www.nutcrackermuseum.com|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanton2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Maureen |last=Stanton|title=Killer Stuff and Tons of Money: An Insider's Look at the World of Flea Markets, Antiques, and Collecting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JpjtUNexvC4C&amp;pg=PT25|date=9 June 2011|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-51605-8|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.fuechtnerwerkstatt.de/tradition|title =     Gotthelf Friedrich Füchtner |publisher = Werkstatt alter Volkskunst|accessdate= December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    http://www.thechristmashaus.com/craftspeople.htm|title =Füchtner Nutcrackers|publisher =thechristmashaus|accessdate= December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorative nutcracker dolls began being popularized outside of Europe after the [[Second World War]], when numerous American soldiers stationed in Germany came home to the United States with German nutcrackers as souvenirs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Further popularization came from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', a ballet adaptation of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s story ''[[The Nutcracker and the Mouse King]]'', which featured a toy soldier nutcracker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ballet, introduced to America during the mid-20th century, became a favorite holiday tradition across the United States&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and helped make nutcracker dolls a [[Christmas decoration]] and a seasonal icon across Western culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Design==
An average handcrafted nutcracker doll is made out of about 60 separate pieces.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nutcracker dolls traditionally resemble toy soldiers, and are often painted in bright colors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Different designs proliferated early; by the early 19th century there were ones dressed as miners, policemen, royalty or soldiers from different armies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More recent variations have been made to resemble various pop-culture or historical figurines, from [[Benjamin Franklin]] to [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]]-uniform American soldiers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Ralph Lauren Corporation''' ({{NYSE|RL}}) is an American corporation producing mid-range to luxury fashion products. They are known for the clothing, marketing and distribution of products in four categories: apparel, home, accessories, and fragrances. The Company's brands include Polo Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Double RL, Ralph Lauren Childrenswear, Denim &amp; Supply Ralph Lauren, Chaps, and Club Monaco. Ralph Lauren Corporation is an American, publicly traded holding company headquartered in New York City, and founded in 1967 by American [[fashion designer]] [[Ralph Lauren]].

==History==
[[File:Polo Ralph Lauren logo.png|thumb|left|Polo Ralph Lauren – the flagship brand of the company.]]
The Ralph Lauren Corporation started in 1967 with men's ties. At 28 years-old, Lauren worked for the tie manufacturer, Beau Brummell. He persuaded the company's president to let him start his own line.  Drawing on his interests in sports, Lauren named his first full line of menswear ‘Polo’ in 1968. He worked out of a single "drawer" from a showroom in the [[Empire State Building]] and made deliveries to stores himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/ralph-lauren-the-patriarch-of-fashions-rise-from-rag-trader-to-american-royalty-a6674416.html |title = Ralph Lauren: The patriarch of fashion's rise from rag-trader to American royalty |publisher = The Independent |date= 2015-09-30 |accessdate= 2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1969, the [[Manhattan]] department store [[Bloomingdale's]] sold Lauren's men line exclusively. It was the first time that Bloomingdale's had given a designer his own in-store shop. In 1971, Ralph Lauren Corporation launched a line of tailored shirts for women, which introduced the Polo player emblem, appearing on the shirt cuff. The first full women's collection was launched the following year.&lt;ref name="Ralph Lauren Through the Years"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/09/29/business/Ralph-Lauren-career.html?_r=0
|title = Ralph Lauren Through the Years |publisher = The New York Times |accessdate= 2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1972 marked the opening of Ralph Lauren's store on Rodeo Drive in [[Beverly Hills, California]], his first freestanding store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ralph Lauren Through the Years |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/09/29/business/Ralph-Lauren-career.html |website=The New York Times |publisher=nytimes |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 Ralph Lauren Corporation introduced a signature cotton mesh Polo shirt in various colours. Featuring the polo player logo on the chest, the shirt became emblematic of the preppy look—one of Lauren's signature style.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1974, Ralph Lauren outfitted the male cast of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' in costumes chosen from his Polo line - a 1920s-style series of men's suits and sweaters, except for the pink suit which Lauren designed especially for [[Robert Redford]]’s ''[[Jay Gatsby]]''. In 1977, [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Woody Allen]] wore Lauren's clothes in the Oscar-winning film, ''[[Annie Hall]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/exploring-the-world-of-fashion-in-film-763147.html|title = Exploring the world of fashion in film |publisher = The Independent |date=1987-11-26 |accessdate= 2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the first Ralph Lauren fragrances, produced by Warner-Lauren, Ltd were launched at Bloomingdale's. Lauren for women, and Polo the men's cologne. This was the first time that a designer introduced two fragrances – one for men and one for women – simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Ralph Lauren Through the Years"/&gt;

The company entered the European market, and went international, in 1981 with the opening of the first freestanding store in [[Bond Street|New Bond Street]] in the [[West End of London]], England.  Lauren opened his first flagship in the Rhinelander mansion, on Madison Avenue and 72nd Street in New York City in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fortune.com/1996/11/11/ralph-lauren-emperor-cover/ |title = Ralph Lauren: The emperor has clothes |publisher = Fortune |date=1996-11-26 |accessdate= 2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 12, 1997, the company becomes a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/ralph-lauren-corp-11816-8646 |title = RALPH LAUREN CORP (RL) IPO |publisher = Nasdaq |accessdate= 2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 98-seat restaurant, RL, opened in March 1999 in a newly constructed building adjacent to the largest Ralph Lauren store at the corner of Chicago and Michigan Avenues. It was followed by the opening of two additional restaurants – Ralph's at 173 Boulevard Saint Germain Paris store in 2010 and The Polo Bar at Polo's store in New York in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/dining/a-ralph-lauren-restaurant-the-polo-bar-comes-to-new-york.html?_r=0 |title = Ralph Lauren Creates His Clubhouse |publisher = New York Times |date=2014-12-09 |accessdate= 2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company launched its website and online shop in 2000 as polo.com by RL Media (a cooperation between Ralph Lauren and NBC). In 2007, Ralph Lauren Corporation acquired the NBC share of RL Media and the website was relaunched as ralphlauren.com. In September 2015, it was announced that [[Stefan Larsson (businessman)|Stefan Larsson]] would replace the company's founder, Ralph Lauren, as CEO in November. Lauren will stay on as executive chairman and chief creative officer.&lt;ref name=NYtimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=TABUCHI|first1=HIROKO|last2=FRIEDMAN|first2=VANESSA|title=Ralph Lauren, Creator of Fashion Empire, Is Stepping Down as C.E.O.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/business/ralph-lauren-creator-of-fashion-empire-steps-down-as-ceo.html|accessdate=30 September 2015|work=NY Times|date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/style/mens-fashion/news/a38385/ralph-lauren-steps-down-ceo/|title=End of an Era: Ralph Lauren Is Stepping Down as CEO of His Company|date=2015-09-29|website=Esquire|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017 it was announced that Larsson had agreed to leave his position as CEO effective May 1, 2017 due to differences with Lauren.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurengensler/2017/02/02/ralph-lauren-stefan-larsson-ceo-departure/#19fee10d18c4|title=Ralph Lauren CEO To Depart Over 'Different Views' With Founder, Shares Tumble|last=Gensler|first=Lauren|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 17, 2017, Ralph Lauren named [[Patrice Louvet]] President and [[Chief Executive Officer]].&lt;ref name=ft-badkar&gt;{{cite news |last=Badkar |first=Mamta |date=May 18, 2017 |title=Ralph Lauren adjusted earnings top estimates as it bridles discounts |url=https://www.ft.com/content/a46757ce-7067-3999-8cb7-28b7bb7db1c7 | work=[[Financial Times]] |location=United Kingdom  |access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louvet most recently served as Group President, Global Beauty at [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ralphlauren-moves-ceo-idUSKCN18D1H7 Reuters]&lt;/ref&gt; He took over on July 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-17/ralph-lauren-names-p-g-veteran-patrice-louvet-as-its-next-chief Bloomberg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2017/05/17/ralph-lauren-ceo-patrice-louvet/ Fortune]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/ralph-lauren-taps-procter-gamble-executive-as-its-next-ceo-1495026766 The Wall Street Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''RiP!: A Remix Manifesto''''' is a 2008 [[open-source film|open-source]] documentary film about "the changing concept of [[copyright]]"&lt;ref&gt;Kirsner, Scott. [http://cinematech.blogspot.com/2007/10/cinematech-filmmaker-q-brett-gaylor-of.html "CinemaTech Filmmaker Q&amp;A: Brett Gaylor of Open Source Cinema".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinnott, Shane. "[http://www.montrealmirror.com/2007/032907/load.html The Load-Down] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630225243/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2007/032907/load.html |date=30 June 2007 }}", ''[[Montreal Mirror]]'', 2007-03-29. Accessed 2008-06-30&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Brett Gaylor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/05/brett-gaylor-talks-rip-remix-manifesto/ brett-gaylor-talks-rip-remix-manifesto] on [[wired.com]] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Created over a period of six years, the documentary film features the collaborative remix work of hundreds of people who have contributed to the [[Open Source Cinema]] website, helping to create the "world's first [[open source]] documentary" as Gaylor put it. The project's [[working title]] was ''Basement Tapes'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-429453083182656636 CinemaTech interview with Brett Gaylor about Open Source Cinema project] at [[Google Videos]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205075005/https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-429453083182656636 |date=5 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (referring to [[The Basement Tapes|the album of the same name]]) but it was renamed ''RiP!: A Remix Manifesto'' prior to theatrical release. Gaylor encourages more people to create their own remixes from this movie,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160826014720/http://www.documentary.org/content/copyright-or-copywrong-rip-challenges-intellectual-property-rights Copyright or Copywrong?: 'RiP' Challenges Intellectual Property Rights] By Marc Glassman on documentary.org (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; using media available from the Open Source Cinema website, or other websites like [[YouTube]], [[Flickr]], [[Hulu]], or [[MySpace]].

==Background==
Gaylor traveled the world to find like-minded people who would help him draft the "Remixer's Manifesto" that makes up the structure of his open source documentary. The manifesto reads as follows:
{{quote|
#Culture always builds on the past.
#The past always tries to control the future.
#Our future is becoming less free.
#To build free societies you must limit the control of the past|Brett Gaylor in Rip! A Remix Manifesto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hardy |first=Steve |url=http://creativegeneralist.com/2009/03/rip-a-remix-manifesto/ |title=Rip! A Remix Manifesto |website=Creative Generalist |date=8 March 2009 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To further his point, Gaylor separates the corporations from the [[public domain]], defining the former using so-called "[[Copy right|CopyRIGHT]]," and the latter, which represents the free exchange of ideas, as "[[Copyleft|CopyLEFT]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gelevan |first=Douglas |url=http://dgelevan.wordpress.com/2010/04/02/getting-ripped-brett-gaylors-rip-a-remix-manifesto-a-case-study/ |title=Getting 'RiP'ped – Brett Gaylor's RiP: A Remix Manifesto |website=Douglas Gelevan Reports |date=2 April 2010 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaylor and Gillis are clearly on the side of the Copyleft, promoting the free flow and growth of creativity and ideas. To enable a free [[Remix culture|remixing culture]] also with his film, he released RiP! under the [[CC BY-NC-SA]] 3.0&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Case_Studies/RIP:_A_Remix_Manifesto IP:_A_Remix_Manifesto] on creativecommons.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creative Commons license]].

==Participants==
The documentary is particularly interested in the [[non liquet|legal]] [[wikt:grey area|grey area]] of remixing existing works. The film features appearances by:

* Gregg Gillis (better known as [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]]) an American musician specializing in [[Mashup (music)|mashup]]-style remixes, which often use a dozen or more unauthorized samples from different songs to create an entirely new track. Gillis' 2006 album Night Ripper had potentially 300 copyright infringements and carried a maximum financial liability penalty of around $45 million. To some he is considered a creative rebel of a mash-up artist, while others deem his work pure copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/arts/story.html?id=e88e2492-f6cb-4059-ba2a-17e79ed736b7 |title=RiP: A Remix Manifesto: review |website=Canada.com |date=16 October 2008 |accessdate=2014-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926143114/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/arts/story.html?id=e88e2492-f6cb-4059-ba2a-17e79ed736b7 |archivedate=26 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lawrence Lessig]], an American [[Academia|academic]] and political activist, and a professor of law at [[Harvard Law School]] and founder of the [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]]. He is best known as a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on [[copyright]], trademark, and [[radio frequency|radio frequency spectrum]], particularly in technology applications. He was previously a professor of law at Stanford Law School. Gaylor discusses the legal protection of fair use with Lessig to determine the ability to produce the film.
* [[Cory Doctorow]], a Canadian blogger, journalist and science fiction author. Doctorow is co-editor of the blog [[Boing Boing]] and is an activist in favor of reforming [[copyright]] laws. He is a proponent of the [[Creative Commons]] organization, using some of their licenses for his books. Common themes in his work include [[digital rights management]] and [[file sharing]]. In the film, Doctorow states, "Technology giveth, technology taketh away.”
* [[Gilberto Gil]], the Brazilian musician and former Minister of Cultural Affairs who initiated pioneering programs in [[Brazil]] through a partnership with [[Creative Commons]]. As Minister, he sponsored a program called Culture Points, which gives [[Grant (money)|grants]] to provide music technology and education to people living in poor areas of the country's cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Rohter |authorlink=Larry Rohter |title=Gilberto Gil and the politics of music |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/03/12/news/gil.php |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |location=[[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Brazil]] |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate=2008-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dan O'Neill]], an underground cartoonist and founder of the [[Air Pirates]], a group which was famously sued by [[The Walt Disney Company]] for copyright infringement.
* [[Jammie Thomas]], the single mom successfully sued by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) at the [[Capitol v. Thomas]] case for Thomas' illegal downloading. The single mother, who made US$36,000 a year, was ordered to pay US$222,220 in damages for making 24 songs available for download on the [[Kazaa]] [[file sharing network]].

==Other topics==
The 1710 [[Statute of Anne]] gave authors the exclusive rights to their works. The documentary was able to be made and distributed due to the part of [[Copyright law of the United States|copyright law]] deemed [[fair use]], the ability to use copyrighted works to prove a point. Fair use allows for [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]. Due to the fact that Gaylor tries to prove a point about copyright law and the rights of artists in his film, he is legally allowed to use examples to get his point across. He uses remixed music in the film to give examples of what would be considered illegal. The film also discusses the consequences of illegal downloading and [[copyright infringement]].

The [[Capitol Records, Inc. v. Thomas-Rasset]]t case was the first file-sharing copyright infringement lawsuit in the United States to be brought in front of a jury by [[major record labels]].

'''''Sentimental Ballad''''' is a 1940 painting by the American artist [[Grant Wood]]. It depicts a group of singing men in a bar.

The painting is located at the [[New Britain Museum of American Art]] in [[New Britain, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arthistoryreference.com/cgi-bin/hd.exe?art2=a10870|title=Grant Wood. Sentimental Ballad|work=ArtHistortReference|accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The painting came to be because of Wood's art dealer [[Associated American Artists]] and the film producer [[Walter Wanger]], who commissioned nine popular artists to paint a motif from the upcoming film ''[[The Long Voyage Home]]'', directed by [[John Ford]]. The other artists who participated were [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Benton]], [[George Biddle]], [[James Ormsbee Chapin|James Chapin]], [[Ernest Fiene]], [[Robert Philipp]], Luis Quintanilla Isasi, [[Raphael Soyer]] and Georges Schreiber. The artists visited the set of the film for several weeks in May 1940. Wood's scene is toward the end of the film and features, from left to right, the actors [[John Qualen]], [[John Wayne]], [[Barry Fitzgerald]], [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]], [[Joe Sawyer]], David Hughes and [[Jack Pennick]].&lt;ref name="nbmaa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbmaa.org/original-site-assets/timeline_highlights/essays/wood.html|title=''Sentimental Ballad'', 1940|publisher=[[New Britain Museum of American Art]]|accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Although originally commissioned for the marketing of a film, the painting was well received in the press and went on to tour American museums.&lt;ref name="nbmaa" /&gt;

'''Sonya Levien''' (born '''Sara Opesken'''; 25 December 1888 &amp;ndash; 19 March 1960) was a Russian-born American screenwriter. She became one of the highest earning female screenwriters in Hollywood in the 1930s and would help a number of directors and film stars transition from silent films to talkies. In 1955 she received an Academy Award for her screenplay ''[[Interrupted Melody]].''

== Early life ==
Sara Opesken (Sonya being the Russian diminutive)&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; was born in Panimunik, a small village in the [[Pale of Settlement]] on 25 December 1888 (later changing the date to 1898.)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest child to parents Julius (b. ca. 1863) and Fanny (b.ca. 1865),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sonya had two brothers, Arnold and Max.&lt;ref name="jwa.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/levien-sonya|title=Sonya Levien {{!}} Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|access-date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Russian authorities kept a watchful eye over citizens, especially [[Jews|Jewish]] people with radical affiliations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: : A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonya's father had a remote connection with a radical newspaper as well as agreeing with the anarchist ideas of Prince [[Peter Kropotkin]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Julius Opesken also joined a [[Narodniks|Narodnik]] study circle before being arrested and put to work in the [[Siberia]]n mines. While their father served his time, the Opesken family moved in with Julius' father, a [[rabbi]], who stressed the importance of language to a young Sonya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: : A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather instructed her in Russian, French, German, and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as well as encouraged her to read from the [[Talmud]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch|Shulhan' Aruk]] on a daily basis.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: : A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, her father escaped exile and made his way to America, choosing to take on the surname of his German rescuer, Levien. He brought the rest of his family over in 1896, where they joined him on the [[Lower East Side|Lower East Side of Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They were not the only Russian Jews between 1891 and 1900, in these nine years over 150,000 Jews came to [[New York City|New York]] alone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Once settled in America, her parents had two more sons, Edward and Nathan.&lt;ref name="jwa.org"/&gt; The family received their naturalization papers in 1905.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

All of the children in her family worked through school to help with expenses. Sonya worked in a feather-duster factory throughout her teenage years, making four dollars each week.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: : A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During her formative years in America, having grown up in poverty, she joined a group of [[Socialism|socialists]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Sonya, like many other European immigrants in America, went to a public grammar school. After she finished in 1901 or 1902, she was unable to continue to high school due to financial issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took out a loan for $36 in order to learn [[stenography]] and get a job as a secretary. It took her four years of work to repay this loan. During her time as a secretary she also became acquainted with [[Settlement movement|settlement]] work and [[Trade union|labor unions]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonya also managed to take some classes at the [[The Educational Alliance|Educational Alliance]] where, in 1903, she met [[Rose Pastor Stokes|Rose Pastor]]. Not only did Pastor hire her as a secretary, she was also a member of the [[Socialist Party]] and the [[Women's Trade Union League]], giving Sonya access to a whole library of texts on these subjects she could read.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Levien began to write her own work by sending in short comedic squibs to [[Life (magazine)|Life]] and with these earnings was able to contribute to her college tuition and her family's well being.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By fall 1906, she enrolled at [[New York University School of Law|New York University Law School]] for a Certificate of Law, seeing it as a more practical job option than writing,&lt;ref name="jwa.org"/&gt; however she still wrote short scenes for productions at her university.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Just a year later, she was hired as a secretary to the editor of ''Success'', [[Samuel Merwin (writer)|Samuel Merwin]]. Here, her duties began to span more than secretary jurisdiction. She also read manuscripts, rewrote articles, sometimes even collaborated with an author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, she went for admission to the [[New York State Bar Association]], but discovered she was too sympathetic in character to work in a court of law. Instead she chose her work at ''Success'' and received a promotion to fiction reader.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Success'' had its last publication in December 1911 and Levien's next employment came from [[Woman's Journal|The Woman's Journal]], a publication interested in the [[National Woman Suffrage Association|women's suffrage movement]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; She worked there in 1912 as an assistant editor and business manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=Nancy J.|date=2015|title=From Greenwich Village to Hollywood: The Literary Apprenticeship OF Sonya Levien|url=|journal=The Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era|doi=10.1017/S1537781414000577|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of 1912 she sent a short story to Carl Hovey, who was a co-editor at the time, and began work at [[The Metropolitan Magazine|The Metropolitan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrows Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having retained a connection with her roots, Sonya helped out at the [[People's Institute]], an organization which helped supply immigrants with the skills they might need to join the workforce in America.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Cepalir|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also worked on the [[National Board of Review|National Board of Censorship]] as an Educational Secretary.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; However, when [[World War I]] commenced, Levien was working in London covering the British [[Women's suffrage|Suffragist]] movement for fourteen months &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1913 and 1914.&lt;ref name="jwa.org"/&gt; Here she wrote editorials urging women to demand for more than just suffrage and ask for school, as well as institutional, reform and better living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Sonya returned to America in 1914 and focused her creative efforts on writing. She sent stories to a number of publications including ''[[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]], [[Collier's|Collier’s]], [[Redbook]], [[Ladies' Home Journal|Ladies Home Journal]], Harpers, [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]], [[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]],'' and ''Century''.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; She then moved onto writing [[melodrama]]s, although her success in this endeavor was not immediate. In 1919 she received her first credit for an original story, the film ''Who Will Marry Me?'' &lt;ref name="jwa.org"/&gt; Her second credit came in 1921, and incidentally ''Cheated Love'' followed a Jewish immigrant, named Sonya who is in love with a doctor above her social standing. She did additional story on this project.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1921, [[Famous Players-Lasky]] bought two of her stories "The Heart of Youth" and "Baby Doll" paying her $2500 and $3000 respectively.  Feedback for Baby Doll was mixed, but was eventually made into the film ''[[The Top of New York]].'' These stories gave Sonya the opportunity of a contract: she would receive $24,000 her first year there and receive a raise of $5000 each year for five consequent years. This led her to move west, to Hollywood, leaving her family behind in New York.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; She worked tirelessly and received three Hollywood credits for ''The Snow Bride, Pink Gods,'' and ''The Exciters.''&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Yet, by 1923, she missed her young son Serge and felt she had the duty to support her husband's career over her own, so she broke her contract by Famous Players-Lasky and returned to her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here she received an editorial position at ''[[McClure's|McClure's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, in fall of 1924, Famous Players-Lasky requested she adapt a novel, ''[[Salome of the Tenements]]'', for the screen, the story of which actually paralleled Sonya's own life story. She made a great many changes to the plot, however reviews for the film highlighted the directing and not the script work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, she did scenario editing work at Samuel Goldwyn Pictures. For this job, she attended Broadway plays and would find ways to adapt them into films.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, her husband's editing work had ended and they decided to move together this time to Hollywood. He would edit stories for [[Cecil B. DeMille|C.B. DeMille]] and Sonya would write scenarios. Unfortunately Carl would not do so well in Hollywood, unable to find another job after DeMille. Sonya found herself with regular work and as the main breadwinner in the family.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Not only did she write for film, but she also continued as an author for magazines and even tried her hand at plays, such as the one-act "By the Sword" which was performed by The Writer's Club.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being a woman, Sonya managed to avoid being categorized as someone who wrote only films for women. She was experienced in all genres (null Western or Gangster films.) Her forte came in adapting outside material for film.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; She worked her first four years back in [[Hollywood]] with the name Sonya Hovey for a number of different studios.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; She worked for [[Warner Bros.]] from January to June 1926. Here, she wrote her first comedy, a move from her usual melodramas. ''[[Footloose Widows]]'' featured mistaken identities, mix ups between poor and wealthy people, and even gold digging- all elements of the screwball comedy genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was hired by C.B. DeMille in August 1926 for [[Metropolitan Pictures]] and [[Pathé]]. She worked for him until June 1928 and during this time experimented in genre. In autumn, she signed with [[Columbia Pictures]], where she wrote a number of features until March 1929.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected to the board of The Writer's Club and in May 1929 was offered a contract at [[Fox Film|Fox Film Corp]]. She would stay with them until 1939.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Her first yearly contract supplied her with $500/ week, and after the first six months she received $600/ week. One year renewal options granted her $750. But although her pay was good, legally she was not able to receive screen credit or publicity for each project she contributed to. She had to pay to advertise her own name.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Sonya became one of the top writers which allowed her to work alongside big stars and well-known directors. In the years 1929-1935, she would work on an estimated six screenplays a year, receiving about five credits.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; During this period, she was able to write four films for [[Charles Farrell]] and [[Janet Gaynor]], two more for Janet Gaynor, five for [[Will Rogers]], and have a total of six of her stories directed by [[Frank Borzage]]. She also worked with directors [[Allan Dwan]] and [[John Ford]]. Although uncredited, she made additions for [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Curly Top (film)|Curly Top]].'' &lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

Sonya garnered a reputation for being able to adapt all kinds of material into a film screenplay, although she was not known for her prowess at dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Fox, she penned a detective thriller ''[[Behind That Curtain (film)|Behind that Curtain]]'', featuring [[Charlie Chan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked at length with [[Frank Borzage]] on ''Lucky Star,'' only to have it be labelled Frank Borzage's ''Lucky Star.'' Sonya helped not only Borzage, but also [[Will Rogers]], transition to sound films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also collaborated with [[S. N. Behrman|S.N. Behrman]] in three of the next six projects she would assist on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levien was Fox’s highest paid female screenwriter during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Rosenbloom 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=Nancy J.|date=2015|title=From Greenwich Village to Hollywood: The Literary Apprenticeship of Soya Levien|url=|journal=The Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era|doi=10.1017/S1537781414000577|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her films were also known for dealing with family conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Screenwriters: Second Series|last=Hurwitz|first=Edith|publisher=Gale Research Company|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, still employed by Fox Studios, Sonya would receive an [[Oscar nominations|Oscar nomination]] for ''[[State Fair (1945 film)|State Fair]].'' &lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/99491/Sonya-Levien/biography|title=The New York Times|last=Hal Erickson|first=Rovi|date=2010|website=The New York Times|publisher=Baseline|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She penned John Ford's first [[Technicolor]] film in 1939, ''[[Drums Along the Mohawk]].'' &lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; She also worked for RKO, working on ''Hunchback of Notre Dame'' in 1939 as well.

She then went on to sign a contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Screenwriters: Second Series|last=Hurwitz|first=Edith|publisher=Gale Research Company|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1955, she had won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[Interrupted Melody]]'' for MGM.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Sonya garnered an impressive filmography, having worked on over 70 films spanning her career, a great deal of the time without a collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Screenwriters: Second Series|last=Hurwitz|first=Edith|publisher=Gale Research Company|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, she was presented with the first Laurel Award presented from the Screenwriters Guild of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-sonya-levien/|title=Sonya Levien – Women Film Pioneers Project|website=wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu|access-date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her last screen credits included ''[[Jeanne Eagels (film)|Jeanne Eagels]]'' from 1957&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-sonya-levien/|title=Sonya Levien Profile|last=Brett Erans|first=Patricia|date=27 September 2013|website=Women Film Pioneers Project|publisher=Columbia University Libraries|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1960, she would receive her final screen credit for Pepe.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Levien married her husband Carl Hovey on 11 October 1917.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/levien-sonya|title=Sonya Levien|last=Levy-Reiner|first=Sherry|date=2009|website=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|access-date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They moved together to East 92nd street in [[New York City|New York]], and Sonya took in Hovey's two children from his previous marriage.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hovey was an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they had little protest from either of their families &lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; and even decided to declare their own children Jewish, although they would not enforce a religious upbringing on them.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Together they had two children: a son, Serge (b. 1920) and a daughter, Tamara (b. 1923.) &lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Although Levien has stated that her instincts told her she should have six or seven children, she found that a large family would take years away from her career and was not financially suitable for her.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In fact, her husband failed to find steady employment once they moved to Hollywood together and she bore the responsibility of supporting him, their children, his two children from a previous marriage, as well as making a comfortable home for them.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

Levien has described herself as one who enjoys music, singing and playing the piano, as well as reading biographies. Although she admired nice clothing, she usually wore sports clothes and hated going shopping. Sonya generally avoided confrontation and arguments with her acquaintances, and shied away from talking on the telephone. She self-identified as ambitious, but also restless in character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Great Lady: A Life of the Screenwriter Sonya Levien|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|publisher=Scarecrow Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those she worked with stated that Levien was easy to work with and would help out others often.&lt;ref name="Rosenbloom 2015"/&gt; Her husband died in 1956 and she developed [[cancer]] in the mid 1950s. Sonya Levien died on 19 March 1960 at the age of 71.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Screenwriters: Second Series|last=Hurwitz|first=Edith|publisher=Gale Research Company|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Levien was a [[Secular jewish culture|Secular Jew]] who was very interested in activism in her early years, living on the East Side of New York. She describes her natural pull to more radical views, joining a group of agitators formed majorly of socialists but which also included [[Anarchism|anarchists]] and [[single-taxers]]. Levien was known for supporting the [[suffragette]] cause in the early 20th century. Both in her film and non-film works, Levien wrote about the struggles of immigrant women and families. Levien belonged to the [[Heterodoxy (group)|Heterodoxy]] club, which was a debate group focusing on radical feminism. She also heavily supported [[Women's emancipation|women’s emancipation]] and [[birth control]]. Many of the films in the beginnings of her career focused on Jewish people, however many of her female characters found their happiness in [[Marriage|wedlock]], and signs of her own radical sensibilities were not always apparent in her film work. Once in Hollywood she was known as an [[Apoliticism|apolitical]] woman. In fact, shortly after 1950, her daughter Tamara and her husband, Lee Gold, were blacklisted as members of the [[Communist party|Communist Party]], Sonya chose never to comment publicly.

'''St Ives''' ({{lang-kw|Porth Ia}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magakernow.org.uk/pdf/placename_masterlist.pdf |title=List of Place-names agreed by the MAGA Signage Panel |accessdate=11 January 2015 |publisher=[[Cornish Language Partnership]] |date=May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729194902/http://www.magakernow.org.uk/pdf/placename_masterlist.pdf |archivedate=29 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "St Ia's cove") is a seaside [[town]], [[civil parish]] and port in [[Cornwall]]. The town lies north of [[Penzance]] and west of [[Camborne]] on the coast of the [[Celtic Sea]]. In former times it was commercially dependent on fishing. The decline in fishing, however, caused a shift in commercial emphasis, and the town is now primarily a popular [[seaside resort]], notably achieving the title of Best UK Seaside Town from the British Travel Awards in both 2010 and 2011. St Ives was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1639. St Ives has become renowned for its number of artists. It was named best seaside town of 2007 by ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper. It should not be confused with [[St Ive]], a [[village]] and civil parish in south-east Cornwall.

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:John Payne memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John Payne memorial, St Ives]]
The origin of St Ives is attributed in legend to the arrival of the Irish saint [[Ia of Cornwall]], in the 5th century. The parish church bears her name, and St Ives derives from it.&lt;ref name=tde&gt;{{citation |last=Lewis |first=Samuel|title=Ives, St. - Ixworth-Thorpe|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51066#s4 |work=A Topographical Dictionary of England |publisher=British History Online |pages=30–33|year=1848 |accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=A. D.|title=The Popular Dictionary of English Place-Names|publisher=Parragon Book Service Ltd and Magpie Books|year=1996|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rocky landscape.JPG|thumb|Rocky landscape]]

[[The Sloop Inn]], which lies on the wharf was a fisherman's pub for many centuries and is dated to "circa 1312", making it one of the oldest inns in Cornwall. The town was the site of a particularly notable atrocity during the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] of 1549. The English [[provost marshal]], [[Anthony Kingston]], came to St Ives and invited the [[portreeve]], John Payne, to lunch at an inn. He asked the portreeve to have the [[gallows]] erected during the course of the lunch. Afterwards the portreeve and the Provost Marshal walked down to the gallows; the Provost Marshal then ordered the portreeve to mount the gallows. The portreeve was then [[hanging|hanged]] for being a "busy rebel".

The seal of St Ives is ''Argent, an ivy branch overspreading the whole field Vert'', with the legend ''Sigillum Burgi St. Ives in Com. Cornub. 1690''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pascoe|first=W. H.|title=A Cornish Armory|page=134|year=1979|publisher=Lodenek Press|location=Padstow, Cornwall|isbn=0-902899-76-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[3rd Spanish Armada|Spanish Armada of 1597]] two Spanish ships, a [[Barque|bark]] and a [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnace]] had made their way to St Ives to seek shelter from the storm which had dispersed the Spanish fleet. They were captured by the English warship [[English ship Warspite (1596)|''Warspite'']] of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] leaking from the same storm. The information given by the prisoners was vital on learning the Armada's objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Edward|title=The Life of Sir Walter Ralegh: Letters Volume 2|date=1868|publisher=Macmillan &amp; Company|pages=186–88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRI5AQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fishing===
[[File:St. Ives, Porthminster Bay, Cornwall, ca. 1895.jpg|thumb|right|[[Photochrom]] of St Ives, 1895]]
From medieval times fishing was important at St Ives; it was the most important fishing port on the north Cornish coast. The pier was built by [[John Smeaton]] in 1767–70 but has been lengthened at a later date. The octagonal lookout with a cupola belongs to Smeaton's design.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N.(1970) ''Cornwall''; 2nd ed. Penguin; p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. K. Hamilton Jenkin]] describes how the St Ives fisherman strictly observed Sunday as a day of rest. St Ives was a very busy fishing port and seining was the usual method of fishing. Seining was carried out by a set of three boats of different sizes, the largest two carrying seine nets of different sizes. The total number of crew was seventeen or eighteen. However this came to an end in 1924. In the decade 1747–1756 the total number of pilchards dispatched from the four principal Cornish ports of [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], [[Fowey]], [[Penzance]], and St Ives averaged 30,000 hogsheads annually (making a total of 900 million fish). Much greater catches were achieved in 1790 and 1796. In 1847 the exports of pilchards from Cornwall amounted to 40,883 hogsheads or 122 million fish while the greatest number ever taken in one seine was 5,600 hogsheads at St Ives in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;''Victoria History of Cornwall'', vol. I, p. 584&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the catch was exported to Italy: for example, in 1830, 6400 hogsheads were sent to Mediterranean ports. From 1829 to 1838, the yearly average for this trade was 9000 hogsheads.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkin (1932) ''Cornish Seafarers''; chapter on fishing&lt;/ref&gt; 

Once the spring mackerel season ends, the fishing fleet head north. In July 1882, ninety luggers and six hundred men were engaged in the Scottish [[herring]] fishery.

While commercial fishing is much reduced, the harbour is still in use, often as well for recreational boating, tourist fishing and day trips to the nearby seal colonies on the Carrack Rocks and other locations along the coast. Recently, a class of Victorian fishing boat unique to St. Ives, known as a "jumbo," has been replicated by boatbuilder Jonny Nance to celebrate the town's maritime heritage. Today's jumbos are operated by the St. Ives Jumbo Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stivesjumbo.com |title=St.Ives Jumbo Association - Home |website=Stivesjumbo.com |date=12 June 2010 |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lifeboat====
{{Main|St Ives Lifeboat Station}}
[[File:St Ives Lifeboat Station viewed across the harbour.jpg|thumb|Lifeboat station in the harbour]]
The first [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] was stationed in the town in 1840. In 1867 the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] built a boathouse at Porthgwidden beach. It proved to be a difficult site to launch from and in 1867 it was replaced by a building in Fore Street. In 1911 a new boathouse was built on the Quay, and then in 1993 a larger station was built at the landward end of the West Pier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Leach |first= Nicholas |title= Cornwall's Lifeboat Heritage |origyear= 2000 |year= 2006 |publisher= Twelveheads Press |location= Chacewater |isbn= 0-906294-43-6 |page= 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven crewmen died in the St Ives lifeboat tragedy of 1939. In the early hours of 23 January 1939 there was a [[Beaufort scale|Force 10]] storm blowing with gusts up to {{Convert|100|mph|km/h}}. The lifeboat ''John and Sara Eliza Stych'' was launched at 3 o'clock to search for a ship reported in trouble off [[Cape Cornwall]]. It rounded The island where it met the full force of the storm as it headed westwards. It capsized three times and drifted across St Ives Bay when its propeller was fouled. The first time it turned over four men were lost; the second time one more; the third time left only one man alive.

===Later history===
[[File:St_Ives_Harbour_Beach_(2011)_by_Walter_Scott_(1974-_).jpg|thumb|St Ives Harbour Beach (2011) by local artist Walter Scott (1974- )]]
The modern seaside resort developed as a result of the arrival of the [[St Ives Bay Line|St Ives Bay branch line]] from [[St Erth]], part of the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1877. With it came a new generation of Victorian seaside holidaymakers. Much of the town was built during the latter part of the 19th century. The railway, which winds along the cliffs and bays, survived the [[Beeching cuts]] and has become a tourist attraction itself.

In 1952, the [[Royal Navy]] [[warship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Historian recreates drama and danger of minesweeper crew's close call |url=http://www.cornwalllive.com/historian-recreates-drama-danger-minesweeper-crew-s-close/story-11452873-detail/story.html |work=This is Cornwall |date=30 November  2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HMS Wave]] ran aground near the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/15187.html HMS Wave ashore]&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was later salvaged, repaired and returned to service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/defence/veterans-attend-commemoration-of-hms-wave-rescue-1-6082303 Veterans attend commemoration of HMS Wave rescue]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[propeller]] believed to be from HMS Wave was washed ashore in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cornwall/content/articles/2008/02/04/aboutcornwall_hmswave_feature.shtml HMS Wave propeller found]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the town was the first landfall of the [[Solar eclipse of 11 August 1999]]. A live BBC programme with the astronomer [[Patrick Moore]] was clouded out and the eclipse was missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astroimaging.org.uk/john/reports/eclipse99.htm |title=Report on Total Solar Eclipse as seen from St Ives |author=John Moore |publisher=Astroimaging |date=11 August 1999|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sharks====
On 28 July 2007 there was a suspected sighting of a [[great white shark]]. The chairman of the [[Shark Trust]] said that "it was impossible to make a conclusive identification and that it could have also been either a [[Shortfin mako shark|Mako]] or a [[Porbeagle]] shark". Coastguards dismissed the claims as "scaremongering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Great White sighting 'possible' | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 28 July 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6920345.stm | accessdate = 30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 June 2011 there was a suspected sighting of an [[oceanic whitetip shark]], after a boat was reportedly attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2002960/St-Ives-fisherman-stares-jaws-7ft-killer-shark-Cornwall-coast.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=David | last=Wilkes | title=St Ives maneater! fisherman stares into the jaws of killer shark | date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shark Trust said that the chances of the species being in British waters were "very small".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-13759504 | work=BBC News | title=St Ives harbourmaster told of two 'shark sightings' | date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July 2017 a suspected blue shark was spotted close to the harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cornwalllive.com/shock-as-shark-spotted-close-to-st-ives-harbour/story-30446172-detail/story.html|last=Gainey|first=Tom|title=Shock as shark spotted close to St Ives harbour|work=This is Cornwall|date=18 July 2017|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 2018, another blue shark was spotted in the harbour, prompting the Shark Trust to ask people to stay out of the water.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/blue-shark-spotted-st-ives-1791151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.piratefm.co.uk/news/latest-news/2635027/watch-shark-swims-into-harbour-at-st-ives/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Porthgwidden Beach - geograph.org.uk - 1263150.jpg|thumb|Porthgwidden Beach]]
St Ives is on the western shore of [[St Ives Bay]], its harbour sheltered by St Ives Island (a headland) and Smeaton's pier. Close to the harbour, in the old part of the town, the streets are narrow and uneven while its wider streets are in the newer parts of the town on rising ground.&lt;ref name=tde/&gt; The town has four beaches: Porthmeor a surfing beach, Porthgwidden a small sandy cove, Harbour by the working port and Porthminster which has almost half a mile of sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The beaches|url=http://www.stives-cornwall.co.uk/beaches-in-stives.html|publisher=St Ives Tourism association|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Ives has an [[oceanic climate]] and has some of the mildest winters and warmest summers in Britain and Northern Europe. It is therefore a popular tourist resort in the summer, and also benefits from an amount of sunshine per year that is above the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/image/5/1/sunshine_annual2010.gif |format=GIF |title=Map showing annual 2010 sunshine for UK |website=Metoffice.gov.uk |accessdate=20 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009093142/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/image/5/1/sunshine_annual2010.gif |archivedate=9 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South West Coast Path]] passes through the town.

==Politics and administration==
St Ives' local government administration has a two-tier structure consisting of two separate councils both of which are democratically elected statutory bodies which St Ives Town Council and [[Cornwall Council]].

The first tier of local government in St Ives is the Town Council which is the closest tier to the general public with a membership of 16 elected town councillors from three wards. The last elections were held in May 2013. The council has responsibilities for providing grant funding to local organisations, public footpaths, bus shelters, beach patrols, traffic control and allotments. The Council is a statutory body which is consulted regarding planning decisions in the town’s area and makes recommendations to the planning authority, Cornwall Council.

Before 1974, St Ives Borough Council was the principal local authority for what now forms the civil parish of St Ives. Since the [[Local Government Act 1972|reform of local government in 1974]], St Ives has an elected town council. The area overseen by the [[Town council|Town Council]] of St Ives includes [[Lelant]], [[Carbis Bay]], [[Halsetown]] and St Ives.  The elected town council members also become charter trustees of the original borough charter (for the duration of their term in office) which dates back to 1639 entitling them to carry out various ceremonial functions such as appointing a Mayor, awarding [[Freedom of the Borough|freedom of the borough]] to individuals, representing the Borough at formal occasions such as [[Remembrance Sunday]] wearing [[Robes|formal ceremonial robes]] and using the [[Coat of arms|Coat of Arms]].  Typically, the Mayor of the Town of St Ives is also the Mayor of the Borough of St Ives.  However, most of the other principal local authority functions for St Ives were undertaken by [[Penwith District Council]] and the [[Cornwall County Council]]. From 1 April 2009 Penwith and the other five Cornish district councils were replaced by a unified council, [[Cornwall Council]].

Like St Ives Town Council, Cornwall Council is a statutory body incorporated by Act of Parliament. Cornwall Council is the second tier of local government in the area and is a unitary authority with a far wider range of powers. The Council deals with roads, street lighting, highways, social services, children and family care, schools and public libraries. St Ives itself elects three of the 123 councillors.

==Religion==
[[File:St Ives Street - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|Methodist Church, Fore Street]][[File:Catholic Church of The Sacred Heart, St Ives - geograph.org.uk - 317565.jpg|thumb|Church of the Sacred Heart (R.C.)]]
The [[St. Ia's Church, St. Ives|parish church]] is dedicated to Saint [[Ia of Cornwall]], an Irish holy woman of the 5th or 6th century, and [[St Andrew]], the patron saint of fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=St Ives Parish Church|url=http://www.stiveschurch.org.uk/|publisher=St Ives Church|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1408 the townsmen attempted to get a papal bull to authorise the consecration of their church and cemetery, but they did not achieve this, so they continued without the rights of baptism or burial. However, they undertook the building of the present church between 1410 and 1434 as a chapel of ease, St Ives being within the parish of [[Lelant]]. They were able to obtain the right to a font in 1428 but consecration of the cemetery only in 1542. For over a century the vicars of Lelant had resisted demands from the inhabitants of St Ives and Towednack for the right of sepulture but in 1542 the right was granted so the vicars transferred their residence to St Ives and abandoned the vicarage of Lelant.&lt;ref&gt;''Cornish Church Guide'' (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 112, 141&lt;/ref&gt; There was damage to the church in 1697 when a storm broke through the sea-wall and damaged the roof and a large window over the altar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Church.|work=The Cornishman|issue=10|date=19 September 1878|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are chapels dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas|St Nicholas]] on the headland of St Ives Island and [[Leonard of Noblac|St Leonard]] on the quay which were used by the fishermen and have been converted for other uses.&lt;ref&gt;''Cornish Church Guide''; p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The former chapel of St Nicholas was partially demolished by the [[War Office]] in 1904&lt;ref&gt;Mee, Arthur (1937) ''Cornwall''. (The King's England.) London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton; p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; but rebuilt in 1909, possibly by [[Edmund Harold Sedding|E H Sedding]], from the old materials. It is plain and rectangular and has since been converted into the New Gallery.

The Roman Catholic Church of the [[Sacred Heart]] and St Ia was built in 1909 to a design by [[Alexander Scoles|A J C Scoles]]. There are also two Methodist chapels, one in [[Fore Street]] of 1831, and another of 1845 higher up the valley, and a Congregational chapel of 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N. (1970) ''Cornwall''; 2nd ed. Penguin; p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===Art===
[[Bernard Leach]] and [[Shōji Hamada]] set up the [[Leach Pottery]] in 1920. Leach was a [[studio potter]] and art teacher,&lt;ref&gt;Cortazzi, Hugh. [http://www.japansociety.org.uk/reviews/05leach.html  "Review of Emmanuel Cooper's ''Bernard Leach Life &amp; Work.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502023614/http://www.japansociety.org.uk/reviews/05leach.html |date=2 May 2008 }} Japan Society (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; and is known as the "Father of British studio pottery",&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080912153818/http://collection.britishcouncil.org/html/artist/artist.aspx?id=18557]&lt;/ref&gt; learned pottery under the direction of Shigekichi Urano (Kenzan VI) in [[Japan]] where he also met Shōji Hamada. They promoted pottery from the point of view of Western and Eastern arts and philosophies. Leach produced work until 1972, and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] held an exhibition of his work in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studiopottery.com/cgi-bin/mp.cgi?item=3 |title=Bernard Leach |website=Studiopottery.com |date= |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Leach Pottery remains operational and houses a small museum showcasing work by Leach and his students.&lt;ref&gt;Leach Pottery website, http://www.leachpottery.com/, last examined Aug 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, the [[Cornish people|Cornish]] artist [[Alfred Wallis]] and [[Ben Nicholson]] and [[Christopher Wood (English painter)|Christopher Wood]] met at St Ives and laid the foundation for the [[St Ives School|artists' colony]]. In 1939, Ben Nicholson, [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Naum Gabo]] settled in St Ives, attracted by its beauty. In 1993, a branch of the [[Tate Gallery]], the [[Tate St Ives]], opened. The Tate looks after the [[Barbara Hepworth Museum]] and her [[sculpture garden]]. The town attracted artists from overseas, such as [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Maurice Sumray]], who moved from [[London]] in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Davies | first = Peter | title = Obituary: Maurice Sumray - Offbeat St Ives painter| work = [[The Independent]] | date = 23 July 2004 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/maurice-sumray-550144.html | accessdate = 30 August 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to do so today with younger artists such as Michael Polat, who took up residence there from his native Germany in 1999.

Before the 1940s, most artists in St Ives and West Cornwall belonged to the St Ives Society of Artists; but events in the late 1940s led to a dispute between the [[Abstract art|abstract]] and [[Figurative art|figurative]] artists in the group. In 1948 the abstract faction broke away to form the [[Penwith Society of Artists]] led by Barbara Hepworth and [[Ben Nicholson]].

In 1962 [[Frederick Spratt]] took a sabbatical in Britain for one year, where he lived and painted representationally in St Ives.

The studio pottery [[Troika Pottery|Troika]] was set up in 1963.

A 2010, a BBC4 film, ''The Art of Cornwall'', presented by [[James Fox (art historian)|James Fox]] said that the St Ives artists "went on to produce some of the most exhilarating art of the twentieth century...for a few dazzling years this place was as famous as Paris, as exciting as New York and infinitely more progressive than London."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wbn80 |title=BBC Four - The Art of Cornwall |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=20 July 2015 |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme explored the lives and works of the key figures and their contributions in establishing St Ives as a major centre of British art from the 1920s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcornwall.org/The_Art_of_Cornwall_BBC4.htm |title=The Art of Cornwall |website=Artcornwall.org |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums===
The Barbara Hepworth Museum and her sculpture garden are the responsibility of Tate St Ives. It was the wish of the late sculptor to leave her work on public display in perpetuity. The St Ives Museum has exhibits illustrating local history and culture, including mining, fishing, agriculture and domestic life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070220132937/http://www.museumsincornwall.org.uk/museums/st-ives-museum] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
[[File:Knill's Monument - geograph.org.uk - 107848.jpg|Knill's Monument, near St Ives, commemorating the mayor, John Knill|thumb]]
[[John Knill]], a former mayor, constructed the Knill Steeple, a granite monument overlooking the town. In 1797, Knill laid down instructions for the celebration of the Knill Ceremony, which was to take place every five years on 25 July (St James's Day). The ceremony involves the Mayor of St Ives, a customs officer, and a vicar accompanied by two widows and ten girls who should be the "daughters of fishermen, tinners, or seamen".

A second celebration, of perhaps greater antiquity, is St Ives Feast, a celebration of the founding of St Ives by St Ia, which takes place on the Sunday and Monday nearest to 3 February each year. It includes a civic procession to Venton Ia, the well of St Ia, and other associated activities. It is one of the two surviving examples of [[Cornish Hurling]] (in a gentler format than its other manifestation at [[St Columb Major]]).

A third festival is the St Ives May Day, a modern revival of [[West Cornwall May Day celebrations]] that were once common throughout west Cornwall.

The St Ives September Festival celebrated its 30th anniversary in September 2008. It is one of the longest running and widest ranging Festivals of the Arts in the UK lasting for fifteen days and includes music (folk, jazz, rock, classical &amp; world), poetry, film, talks and books. It was founded in 1978 as a joint venture by local entrepreneurs and the International Musicians Seminar. Many local artists open up their studios to allow visitors to see how their art is produced. There is free music in many pubs almost every night, and concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = St Ives September Festival | publisher = St Ives September Festival Committee | url = http://www.stivesseptemberfestival.co.uk | accessdate = 30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many events are held at the Western Hotel or St Ives Guildhall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stivestic.co.uk |title=Tourist board for St Ives, West Cornwall, UK - VisitStIves.org.uk |website=Stivestic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Ives has a 500-seat theatre which hosts some of the festival events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Kidz R Us St Ives Theatre | publisher = Kidz R Us | url = http://www.kidzrus.net | accessdate = 30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13040">The '''Standard Reference Method''' or '''SRM'''&lt;ref&gt;"Beer 10-A Spectrophotometric Color Method", ASBC Methods of Analysis&lt;/ref&gt; is  one of several systems modern brewers use to specify beer color. Determination of the SRM value involves measuring the [[attenuation]] of light of a particular wavelength (430&amp;nbsp;nm) in passing through 1&amp;nbsp;cm of the beer, expressing the attenuation as an absorption and scaling the absorption by a constant (12.7 for SRM; 25 for EBC). 

The SRM (or [[European Brewery Convention|EBC]]) number represents a single point in the absorption spectrum of beer. As such it cannot convey full color information which would require 81 points, but it does remarkably well in this regard (it conveys 92% of spectral information) even when [[fruit beers]] are considered. 

Auxiliary "deviation coefficients" (see Augmented SRM below) can pick up the remainder and are necessary for fruit beers and when subtle color differences in malt beers are to be characterized.

==Measurement method==
The [[American Society of Brewing Chemists|ASBC]] and EBC measurements are now identical (both done at the same wavelength and in the same size cuvette) but the scaling is different. 

A photometer or spectrophotometer is used to measure the attenuation of deep blue (violet) light at 430&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]], as it passes through 1&amp;nbsp;cm of beer contained in a standard 1&amp;nbsp;cm by 1&amp;nbsp;cm cuvette. The absorption is the log of the ratio of the intensity of the light beam entering the sample to the intensity leaving.   This difference is multiplied by 12.7&amp;nbsp;in the SRM system and 25 in the EBC (see below). 

For example, if the light intensity leaving is one one-hundredth the light intensity entering the ratio is 100, the absorption is 2 and the SRM is 25.4. The scale factor derives from the original definition of SRM discussed in the next paragraph.
 
The SRM number was originally, and still is,  defined by "Beer color intensity on a sample free of turbidity and having the spectral characteristics of an average beer is 10 times the [[absorbance]] of the beer measured in a 1/2-inch cell with monochromatic light at 430 nanometers."&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Modern spectrophotometers use 1&amp;nbsp;cm cuvettes rather than 1/2&amp;nbsp;inch ones. When a 1&amp;nbsp;cm cuvette is used, application of the [[Beer-Lambert law|Bouguer-Beer-Lambert law]] shows that the multiplier should be 12.7 rather than 10. When the SRM value for a beer or wort is larger than about 30 the log linear limit of some instruments using 1&amp;nbsp;cm cuvettes is approached. In such cases the sample is diluted with deionized water. Using Beer-Lambert again gives the mathematical definition of SRM in the general case as: 
:&lt;math&gt;SRM=12.7\times D \times A_{430}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the dilution factor (&lt;math&gt;D=1&lt;/math&gt; for undiluted samples, &lt;math&gt;D=2&lt;/math&gt; for 1:1 dilution etc.) and &lt;math&gt;A_{430}&lt;/math&gt; the absorbance at 430&amp;nbsp;nm in 1&amp;nbsp;cm.

The 430-nanometer wavelength corresponds to a deep blue (violet) light, and was chosen, as was the multiplier, to make values determined in the SRM system comparable to those determined using the [[degrees Lovibond|Lovibond]] system in use at the time the SRM was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Stone, Miller, M.C. "The Standardization of Methods for the Determination of Color in Beer"ASBC Proceedings 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

The SRM was adopted in 1950 by the [[American Society of Brewing Chemists]] which had recognized the need for an instrument based measurement of color unburdened by the difficulties of the Lovibond system which relies (it is still in use in many industries including brewing{{snd}} malts are often labeled with the Lovibond color of laboratory worts prepared from them) on visual comparison of the sample to tinted glass discs. Beer colors measured in SRM and degrees Lovibond were, as noted above, approximately equal at the time of adoption of the SRM. However, modern analytical methods show that SRM and Lovibond diverge for darker colors. Comparison of EBC and Lovibond data published by modern malsters shows that the relationship between SRM and Lovibond (ºL) is:

:&lt;math&gt;SRM = 1.3546 \times {^\circ L} - 0.76&lt;/math&gt;.

==EBC==
The '''EBC''' system of color measurement is similar to the SRM. Measurements are taken at 430&amp;nbsp;nm in a 1&amp;nbsp;cm cell but the unit of color is 25 times&lt;ref&gt;2.13.2 Spektralphotometrisch (EBC-Methode), Brautechnische Analysenmethoden Band II, MEBAK 2002&lt;/ref&gt; the dilution factor times A&lt;sub&gt;430&lt;/sub&gt;  as opposed to 12.7 times the dilution factor times A&lt;sub&gt;430&lt;/sub&gt; so that
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{EBC} = \mbox{SRM} \times 1.97&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{SRM} = \mbox{EBC} \times .508&lt;/math&gt;

Thus EBC is approximately twice SRM and this applies at any color depth. The agreement between SRM and Lovibond is fair for pale beers (10 °L ~ 12.7 SRM) but worsens for  darker beers or worts (40 °L ~ 53.4 SRM).

Both systems demand that the beer be free of turbidity prior to the measurement at 430&amp;nbsp;nm. In the SRM a second measurement is taken at 700&amp;nbsp;nm. If the absorption at this wavelength is less than 0.039 (this number comes from &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;) times the absorption at 430&amp;nbsp;nm the beer is considered turbidity free. If not, it is to be filtered or centrifuged and the reading repeated. If the ratio test is not passed after clarification then the beer does not have "average spectral characteristics" and, technically, is not qualified to be characterized by the SRM method. The augmented SRM method described below removes this difficulty.

In the EBC system the beer is required to be filtered if its turbidity is more than 1 EBC turbidity unit (equivalent to 1 [[Formazin Turbitity Unit|FTU]]). No absorption measurement is made other than at 430&amp;nbsp;nm. (the turbidimeter measures scattering at 650&amp;nbsp;nm).

Note that an earlier version of EBC color was based on absorption at 530 [[nanometer]]s, which permitted no direct conversion between the two systems. However, if one assumes a linear log absorption spectrum (the [[Linner Hue Index|Linner]] hypothesis from the realm of [[caramel color]]), and knows the [[Linner Hue Index]],&lt;ref name="Linner"&gt;R T Linner, "Caramel color: a new method  of determining its color hue and tinctorial power." ''Proceedings of the Society of Soft Drink Technologists Annual Meeting,'' 1970, p 63-72.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;H_L&lt;/math&gt;, the absorptions are related by:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{430} = A_{530} \times 10^{H_{L}/10}&lt;/math&gt;

A formula for converting between the old EBC color value and SRM sometimes continues to appear in literature. It should not be used, as it is flawed and based on measurements which are no longer taken.

Part of the problem with this formula is that beer spectra are ''not'' log linear. The absorption of 1&amp;nbsp;cm of a beer with "average spectral characteristics" (average here means the average of the absorption spectra of the ensemble of 99 beers as described in&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;) at wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is well described by

:&lt;math&gt;A(\lambda) = {SRM\over 12.7}(0.018747e^{-{(\lambda - 430)\over 13.374}} + 0.98226e^{-{(\lambda - 430)\over 80.514}})&lt;/math&gt;

While it is clear that one could use this formula to compute A&lt;sub&gt;530&lt;/sub&gt; from the SRM measured at 430&amp;nbsp;nm and thus interconvert between SRM and old EBC this is not where its value lies. Because it represents, at least approximately, the full absorption spectrum of the beer it can be used to calculate the [[tristimulus]] color (three color coordinates in a chosen [[color space]] which describes the color an observer actually sees) of a beer of known SRM by following the prescription of [[ASTM International|ASTM]] E-308.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM E-308-96 "Standard Practices for Computing the Colors of Objects by Using the CIE System", ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tristimulus color ==
There has been interest in tristimulus reporting in the brewing community in recent years and the ASBC has an approved Method of Analysis [MOA] for tristimulus characterization.&lt;ref&gt;"Beer 10-C Tristimulus Analysis", ASBC Methods of Analysis&lt;/ref&gt; The absorption of the sample is measured in 1&amp;nbsp;cm at 81 wavelengths separated by 5&amp;nbsp;nm starting at 380&amp;nbsp;nm and extending to 780&amp;nbsp;nm. These are converted to transmission values (by taking the [[Antilog#Exponential functions|antilogarithm]] of each absorption) and inserting the results into ASTM E-308. The reported tristimulus values are in [[Lab color space|L&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;]] color space and describe what is seen under [[Standard illuminant|Illuminant]] C (daylight) by a [[CIE 1931 color space|10° observer]] when the [[Beer-Lambert law|path]] is 1&amp;nbsp;cm. The choice of path, illuminant, observer and color space does not represent a limitation of E-308 but rather the ASBC's need to standardize reporting.

If we are given only the SRM value for a beer we can compute the approximate transmission spectrum if the beer has average spectral characteristics simply by taking the antilog of &lt;math&gt;A(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;T(\lambda) = log^{-1}(-{SRM\over 12.7}(0.018747e^{-{(\lambda - 430)\over 13.374}} + 0.98226e^{-{(\lambda - 430)\over 80.514}}))&lt;/math&gt;

This can be used with E-308 to calculate tristimulus color in any path, for any illuminant, for either observer in any colorspace derivable from [[Tristimulus#Tristimulus values|CIE XYZ space]]. This formula could, for example, be used to compute color patches to be printed on transparency or card stock for use in evaluating the SRM of actual beers but  [[Color chart#color selection chart|color swatches]] prepared in this way are only valid for the illuminant, observer and path used in the E-308 calculation. The [[BJCP]] color guide was prepared in this way. This illustrates that the SRM does convey full color information if the beer has average spectral characteristics. If it does not then we need more information than just the SRM provides.

==Augmented SRM==
Recent research&lt;ref&gt;A.J. deLange,"The Standard Reference Method of Beer Color Specification as the Basis for a New Method of Beer Color Reporting", J.Am.Soc. Brew. Chem 66(3) 143-150, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that the transmission spectrum  of a beer (with no restriction on its spectral characteristics) can be represented by:

&lt;math&gt;T(\lambda) = log^{-1}(-{SRM\over 12.7}(0.018747e^{-{(\lambda - 430)\over 13.374}} + 0.98226e^{-{(\lambda - 430)\over 80.514}} +c_1 \xi_1 + c_2 \xi_2 + ...))&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\xi_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[eigenvector]]s of the [[covariance matrix]] of the normalized transmission spectra of the ensemble of beers from which the average normalized spectrum (the sum of the two exponential terms in parentheses in the &lt;math&gt;A(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; formula) was determined  and &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; etc. are obtained as the [[dot product]]s of the eigenvectors with the normalized transmission spectrum of the beer being characterized. This formula is identical to the one given previously with the exception that it has been augmented by the &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; coefficients which encode the deviation of the sample normalized spectrum from the average normalized spectrum. Where the sample beer has a normalized spectrum close to the average the c's are small and it is remarkable how often this is the case. Typically one or two augmentation coefficients are sufficient and they are frequently small enough that one or more can be neglected. For example, an imported ale with SRM equal to 6.8 has coefficients -0.07 and -0.1. Using both these coefficients one obtains color accuracy of less than one L&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; space unit (the limit of perception) in up to a 10&amp;nbsp;cm path under Illuminant C. Using just the SRM for this beer gives a reasonably good description of its color with error of about 4 L&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; units. Beers which deviate dramatically from the "average" spectrum are easily accommodated. Thus a sample of Kriek (Belgian cherry beer), has an SRM of 15.27. Were its color to be reconstructed from just the SRM it would be the color of an "average" beer which will be dark amber{{snd}} not the red of a Kriek. Including 3 coeffiecents (1.8, 0.8 and -0.1) yields color accuracy of less than 1 L&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; unit in paths up to 8&amp;nbsp;cm again under Illuminant C.

Augmented SRM is advantageous relative to the ASBC tristimulus method in that color under any viewing circumstances can be computed in addition to which the familiar SRM rating is retained. Because of [[Metamerism (color)|metamerism]] one cannot, in the general case of non zero deviation coefficients, estimate the original spectrum from the L&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; values reported by the ASBC method.

[[Image:Facciata frontale del Teatro Borgatti.jpg|thumb|Teatro Borgatti]]
The '''Teatro Comunale Giuseppe Borgatti''' (Communal Theatre of Giuseppe Borgatti) is a 19th-century theatre and music performance hall located on Via Campagnoli Bartolomeo in [[Cento]], [[Province of Ferrara]], Region of [[Emilia-Romagna]], Italy. The theater is named after the prominent [[tenor]] from Cento, [[Giuseppe Borgatti]] (1871–1950).

The theatre was built between 1856 and 1861 using designs by [[Antonio Giordani]] and [[Fortunato Lodi]]. The colourful exterior has a Neo-[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style with rounded arches. The interiors were [[fresco]]ed during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssi.comune.cento.fe.it/sitweb/index.php/poi/action/dettaglio/id/19 Comune of Cento] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220033456/http://ssi.comune.cento.fe.it/sitweb/index.php/poi/action/dettaglio/id/19 |date=2015-02-20 }} tourism entry&lt;/ref&gt; Structural damage from the  [[2012 Northern Italy earthquakes]] led to closure of the theater, until restorations completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fondazioneteatroborgatti.it/highlights/storia-di-un-teatro/ Fondazione Teatro G.

'''The Art of Sound''' is an [[exhibition]] which was developed in 2013 by the [[National Film and Sound Archive|National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA)]] in collaboration with [[art galleries]] in Australia to explore the use of [[sound]] in the [[visual arts]].

The curators at the NSFA compiled a sound palette,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfsa.gov.au/artofsound/art-sound-full-palette-listing/ Sound Palette, The Art of Sound] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114005326/http://www.nfsa.gov.au/artofsound/art-sound-full-palette-listing/ |date=2013-11-14 }} on ''nfsa.gov.au''&lt;/ref&gt; which comprises a wide variety of Australian audio recordings from the NFSA's sound collection. There are music, speeches, and sounds from the environment. The curators at partner art galleries search the sound palette to find audio material that would complement their individual artworks and combine them for unique audience experiences at each gallery.

[[File:Simx2=rotOK.svg|right|thumb|A reflection against an axis followed by a reflection against a second axis not parallel to the first one results in a total motion that is a [[rotation]] around the point of intersection of the axes.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''transformation geometry''' (or '''transformational geometry''') is the name of a mathematical and [[pedagogic]] take on the study of [[geometry]] by focusing on [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of [[geometric transformation]]s, and properties that are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under them.  It is opposed to the classical [[synthetic geometry]] approach of [[Euclidean geometry]], that focuses on proving [[theorem]]s.

For example, within transformation geometry, the properties of an isosceles triangle are deduced from the fact that it is mapped to itself by a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] about a certain line. This contrasts with the classical proofs by the criteria for [[triangle congruence|congruence of triangles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=68221&amp;set=4F331370_2_173&amp;database=g Georges Glaeser – The crisis of geometry teaching]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first systematic effort to use transformations as the foundation of geometry was made by [[Felix Klein]] in the 19th century, under the name [[Erlangen programme]].  For nearly a century this approach remained confined to mathematics research circles.   In the 20th century efforts were made to exploit it for [[mathematical education]].  [[Andrei Kolmogorov]] included  this approach (together with [[set theory]]) as part of a proposal for geometry teaching reform in [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="russianedu"/&gt;  These efforts culminated in the 1960s with the general reform of mathematics teaching known as the [[New Math]] movement.

== Pedagogy ==
An exploration of transformation geometry often begins with a study of [[reflection symmetry]] as found in daily life. The first real transformation is ''[[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in a line'' or ''reflection against an axis''. The [[composition (mathematics)|composition]] of two reflections results in a [[rotation]] when the lines intersect, or a [[translation (mathematics)|translation]] when they are parallel. Thus through transformations students learn about [[Euclidean plane isometry]]. For instance, consider reflection in a vertical line and a line inclined at 45° to the horizontal. One can observe that one composition yields a counter-clockwise quarter-turn (90°) while the reverse composition yields a clockwise quarter-turn. Such results show that transformation geometry includes [[non-commutative]] processes.

An entertaining application of reflection in a line occurs in a proof of the [[one-seventh area triangle]] found in any triangle.

Another transformation introduced to young students is the [[homothetic transformation|dilation]]. However, the [[inversive geometry#reflection in a circle|reflection in a circle]] transformation seems inappropriate for lower grades. Thus [[inversive geometry]], a larger study than grade school transformation geometry, is usually reserved for college students.

Experiments with concrete [[symmetry group]]s make way for abstract [[group theory]]. Other concrete activities use computations with [[complex number]]s, [[hypercomplex number]]s, or [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] to express transformation geometry.
Such transformation geometry lessons present an alternate view that contrasts with classical [[synthetic geometry]]. When students then encounter [[analytic geometry]], the ideas of [[coordinate rotations and reflections]] follow easily. All these concepts prepare for [[linear algebra]] where the [[reflection (linear algebra)|reflection concept]] is expanded.

Educators have shown some interest and described projects and experiences with transformation geometry for children from kindergarten to high school. In the case of very young age children, in order to avoid introducing new terminology and to make links with students' everyday experience with concrete objects, it was sometimes recommended to use words they are familiar with, like "flips" for line reflections, "slides" for translations, and "turns" for rotations, although these are not precise mathematical language. In some proposals, students start by performing with concrete objects before they perform the abstract transformations via their definitions of a mapping of each point of the figure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2319962 R.S. Millman – Kleinian transformation geometry, Amer. Math. Monthly 84 (1977)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001365/136586eo.pdf UNESCO - New trends in mathematics teaching, v.3, 1972 / pg. 8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4616&amp;context=etd Barbara Zorin – Geometric Transformations in Middle School Mathematics Textbooks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001248/124809eo.pdf UNESCO - Studies in mathematics education. Teaching of geometry]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to restructure the courses of geometry in Russia, Kolmogorov suggested presenting it under the point of view of transformations, so the geometry courses were structured based on [[set theory]]. This led to the appearance of the term "congruent" in schools, for figures that were before called "equal": since a figure was seen as a set of points, it could only be equal to itself, and two triangles that could be overlapped by isometries were said to be [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]].&lt;ref name="russianedu"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qwyBPybT4oMC&amp;printsec=frontcover Alexander Karp &amp; Bruce R. Vogeli – Russian Mathematics Education: Programs and Practices, Volume 5], pgs. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt;

One author expressed the importance of [[group theory]] to transformation geometry as follows:
:I have gone to some trouble to develop from first principles all the group theory that I need, with the intention that my book can serve as a first introduction to transformation groups, and the notions of abstract group theory if you have never seen these.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miles Reid]] &amp; Balázs Szendröi (2005) ''Geometry and Topology'', pg. xvii, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{isbn|0-521-61325-6}}, {{MathSciNet|id=2194744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''WorleyParsons Limited''' is an Australian engineering company which provides project delivery and consulting services to the resources and energy sectors, and complex process industries.

==History==
1970s: [[John Grill]] (chief executive officer 1975–2012), joined Smith, de Kantzow &amp; Wholohan, which led to the 1976 establishment Wholohan Grill and Partners, a small Australian engineering consultancy. Wholohan Grill and Partners grew steadily throughout the 1970s and 80s.

1980s: In 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worleyparsons.com/AboutUs/history/Pages/Historysnapshot.aspx|title=Text History|website=www.worleyparsons.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wholohan Grill and Partners acquired the Australian interests of Worley, an American-based engineering firm. The company changed its name to Worley and from this point began expanding steadily, securing long term contracts in Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, and creating local joint ventures, most of which are still active today.

1990s: Throughout the 1990s Worley expanded both its industry sector and geographical footprint.  A policy of diversification saw Worley grow from its roots in the hydrocarbons sector into the power, infrastructure and environment, and minerals and metals sectors. At the start of the new millennium Worley was well poised to continue its industry sector and geographic expansion with 30 offices and 3,000 personnel globally.  This success enabled Worley to diversify further through additional partnerships and acquisitions.

2000s: In 2002 Worley became a publicly listed company on the [[Australian Securities Exchange|Australian Stock Exchange]], leading to a period of acquisitions of increasing magnitude around the globe, including companies in Canada, Oman, and China. In 2004 Worley acquired Parsons E&amp;C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pipeliner.com.au/2016/03/16/worley-acquires-parsons-ec/|title=News {{!}}   Worley acquires Parsons E&amp;C to forge global services provider|last=|first=|date=|website=www.worleyparsons.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons E&amp;C had its own history stemming back to 1944, when Ralph M. Parsons started what is now the [[Parsons Corporation]] in Los Angeles.  In 2002, Parsons Corporation separated Parsons E&amp;C from its other business units.
