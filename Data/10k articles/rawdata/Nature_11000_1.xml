[[File:Dairy.jpg|thumb|Varieties of goat cheese]]
An '''animal product''' is any material derived from the body of an [[animal]]. Examples are fat, flesh, blood, milk, eggs, and lesser known products, such as [[isinglass]] and [[rennet]].&lt;ref&gt;Unklesbay, Nan. ''World Food and You''. Routledge, 1992, p. 179ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal by-products, as defined by the USDA, are products harvested or manufactured from livestock other than muscle meat.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/animal-production-marketing-issues/glossary/&lt;/ref&gt;  In the EU, animal by-products (ABPs) are defined somewhat more broadly, as materials from animals that people do not consume.&lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/animal-by-products_en&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, chicken eggs for human consumption are considered by-products in the US but not France; whereas eggs destined for animal feed are classified as animal by-products in both countries.  This does not in itself reflect on the condition, safety, or "wholesomeness" of the product.

Animal by-products are [[Carrion|carcasses]] and parts of carcasses from slaughterhouses, animal shelters, zoos and veterinarians, and products of animal origin not intended for human consumption, including catering waste. These products may go through a process known as "[[Rendering (animals)|rendering]]" to be made into human and non-human foodstuffs, fats, and other material that can be sold to make commercial products such as cosmetics, paint, cleaners, polishes, glue, soap and ink. The sale of animal by-products allows the [[meat industry]] to compete economically with industries selling sources of vegetable protein.&lt;ref&gt;Ockerman, Herbert and Hansen, Conly L. ''Animal by-product processing &amp; utilization''. Technomic Publishing Company Inc., 2000, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, products made from fossilized or decomposed animals, such as [[petroleum]] [[Formation of petroleum|formed]] from the ancient remains of marine animals, are not considered animal products. Crops grown in soil [[Fertilizer#Organic fertilizer|fertilized]] with animal remains are rarely characterized as animal products.

Several diets prohibit the inclusion of some animal products, including [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]], [[Kashrut|kosher]], and [[halal]]. Other diets, such as [[veganism]] and the [[raw veganism|raw vegan diet]], exclude any material of animal origin.&lt;ref&gt;Stepaniak, Joanne. ''Being Vegan: Living with Conscience, Conviction, and Compassion''. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2000, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In international trade legislation, the terminology '''products of animal origin''' '''(POAO)''' is used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-products-import-and-export Animals and animal products: international trade regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slaughterhouse waste==
Slaughterhouse waste is defined as animal body parts cut off in the preparation of carcasses for use as food. This waste can come from several sources, including [[slaughterhouse]]s, [[restaurant]]s, stores and [[farm]]s. In the UK, slaughterhouse waste is classed as category 3 risk waste in the [[Animal By-Products Regulations]], with the exception of condemned meat which is classed as category 2 risk.

==Animal By-Product in Pet Food==
The leftover pieces that comes from the process of stripping meat from animals tends to get used for different purposes. One of them is to put these parts into pet food. Many large, well-known pet food brands use animal by-products as protein sources in their recipes. This can include animal feet, livers, lungs, heads, spleens, etc.

The '''Antarctic ice sheet''' is one of the two [[polar ice cap]]s of the [[Earth]]. It covers about 98% of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[continent]] and is the largest single mass of [[ice]] on Earth. It covers an area of almost {{convert|14|e6km2|abbr=off}} and contains {{convert|26.5|e6km3|cumi|abbr=off}} of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21692423 |title=BBC News - Antarctic ice volume measured |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cubic kilometer of ice weighs approximately one metric gigaton, meaning that the ice sheet weighs 26,500,000 gigatons. Approximately 61 percent of all [[fresh water]] on the Earth is held in the Antarctic [[ice sheet]], an amount equivalent to about 58 m of sea-level rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-cryosphere.net/7/375/2013/tc-7-375-2013.pdf |title=Bedmap2: improved ice bed, surface and thickness datasets for Antarctica |author1=P.

==History==

The icing of Antarctica began in the middle [[Eocene]] about 45.5 million years ago&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=5254620 Sedimentological evidence for the formation of an East Antarctic ice sheet in Eocene/Oligocene time] Palaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, &amp; palaeoecology ISSN 0031-0182, 1992, vol. 93, no1-2, pp. 85–112 (3 p.)&lt;/ref&gt; and escalated during the [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event]] about 34 million years ago. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels were then about 760 [[parts per million|ppm]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news172072921.html New CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; data helps unlock the secrets of Antarctic formation] September 13th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm. Carbon dioxide decrease, with a tipping point of 600 ppm, was the primary agent forcing Antarctic glaciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/12/111201174225.htm |title=Drop in carbon dioxide levels led to polar ice sheet, study finds |doi=10.1126/science.1203909 |publisher=ScienceDaily |accessdate=2014-01-28|bibcode=2011Sci...334.1261P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The glaciation was favored by an interval when the Earth's orbit favored cool summers but [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]] marker changes were too large to be explained by Antarctic ice-sheet growth alone indicating an [[ice age]] of some size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature03135 | volume=433 | title=Rapid stepwise onset of Antarctic glaciation and deeper calcite compensation in the Pacific Ocean | year=2005 | journal=Nature | pages=53–57 | last1 = Coxall | first1 = Helen K.| bibcode=2005Natur.433...53C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of the [[Drake Passage]] may have played a role as well&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0163:EOTITS&gt;2.3.CO;2 | volume=24 | title=Eocene-Oligocene transition in the Southern Ocean: History of water mass circulation and biological productivity | year=1996 | journal=Geology | page=163 | last1 = Diester-Haass | first1 = Liselotte | last2 = Zahn | first2 = Rainer}}&lt;/ref&gt; though models of the changes suggest declining CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels to have been more important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = DeConto | first1 = Robert M.  | year=2003 | title=Rapid Cenozoic glaciation of Antarctica induced by declining atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | journal=Nature | volume=421 | pages=245–249 | doi = 10.1038/nature01290 | bibcode=2003Natur.421..245D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western Antarctic ice sheet declined somewhat during the warm early [[Pliocene]] epoch, approximately 5 to 3 million years ago; during this time the [[Ross Sea]] opened up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Naish |first1=Timothy |display-authors=etal |year=2009 |title=Obliquity-paced Pliocene West Antarctic ice sheet oscillations |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=458 |issue=7236 |pages=322–328 |bibcode=2009Natur.458..322N |doi=10.1038/nature07867 |pmid=19295607 |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?httpsredir=1&amp;article=1186&amp;context=geosciencefacpub}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there was no significant decline in the land-based Eastern Antarctic ice sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shakun |first=Jeremy D. |display-authors=etal |year=2018 |title=Minimal East Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat onto land during the past eight million years |journal=Nature |volume=558 |pages=284–287 |doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0155-6 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0155-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C/decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. Although this is partly offset by fall cooling in East Antarctica, this effect is restricted to the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="SteigBlog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SteigBiog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SteigSchneider2009" /&gt;

===Sea ice and land ice===

{{main|Antarctic sea ice}}
Ice enters the sheet through precipitation as snow. This snow is then compacted to form glacier ice which moves under gravity towards the coast. Most of it is carried to the coast by fast moving [[ice stream]]s. The ice then passes into the ocean, often forming vast floating [[ice shelves]]. These shelves then melt or [[Ice calving|calve]] off to give [[iceberg]]s that eventually melt.

If the transfer of the ice from the land to the sea is balanced by snow falling back on the land then there will be no net contribution to global [[Sea level rise|sea levels]]. The general trend shows that a warming climate in the southern hemisphere would transport more moisture to Antarctica, causing the interior ice sheets to grow, while calving events along the coast will increase, causing these areas to shrink. A 2006 paper derived from satellite data, measuring changes in the [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|gravity]] of the ice mass, suggests that the total amount of ice in Antarctica has begun decreasing in the past few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Antarctic sea ice anomalies have roughly followed the pattern of warming, with the greatest declines occurring off the coast of West Antarctica. East Antarctica sea ice has been increasing since 1978, though not at a statistically significant rate. The atmospheric warming has been directly linked to the mass losses in West Antarctica of the first decade of the twenty-first century. This mass loss is more likely to be due to increased melting of the ice shelves because of changes in ocean circulation patterns (which themselves may be linked to atmospheric circulation changes that may also explain the warming trends in West Antarctica). Melting of the ice shelves in turn causes the ice streams to speed up.&lt;ref name="PayneVieli2004"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2004GL021284| last1 = Payne | first1 = A.

'''Calvert Cliffs State Park''' is a public recreation area in [[Lusby, Maryland|Lusby]], [[Calvert County, Maryland|Calvert County]], [[Maryland]], that protects a portion of cliffs that extend for 24 miles along the eastern flank of the [[Calvert Peninsula]] on the west side of [[Chesapeake Bay]] from [[Chesapeake Beach, Maryland|Chesapeake Beach]] southward to [[Drum Point, Maryland|Drum Point]].&lt;ref name=mdnr/&gt;&lt;ref name=mgs/&gt; The [[state park]] is known for the abundance of mainly [[Middle Miocene]] sub-epoch [[fossil]]s that can be found on the shoreline.&lt;ref name=micro/&gt;

==Natural history==
===Geology===
The park contains the [[type locality (geology)|type locality]] site of the Early to Middle [[Miocene]] '''Calvert Formation'''.&lt;ref name=mgs2/&gt; These rocks are the [[sediment]] from a coastal ocean that covered the area during that time. The age of the formation is (19-)18–15(-14) [[million years ago]] ([[Megaannum#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]), i.e. it extends essentially over the [[Hemingfordian]] [[NALMA|stage]]. This formation occurs in Maryland and neighboring [[Virginia]].

In addition, rocks of the younger [[Choptank Formation|Choptank]] and the [[St. Marys Formation]]s are exposed here. This makes Calvert Cliffs State Park extremely interesting for its [[paleoclimatology]] and [[paleontology]], because the accessible [[Stratum|strata]] provide a good record of the [[Middle Miocene Climate Transition]] and document a minor [[mass extinction event]] — the "[[Middle Miocene disruption]]." [[Fossil]] collecting and "[[rockhound]]ing" are permitted on the beach; the cliffs are closed due the dangers of erosion.&lt;ref name=mdnr/&gt;
===Paleontology===
[[File:Calvert Zone 10 Calvert Co MD 2.jpg|thumb|left|Fossils from the Calvert Formation, Zone 10, Calvert Co., MD (Miocene)]]
The Calvert Formation is notable for its plentiful fossil [[shark]] teeth. Especially popular among "rockhounds" are those from giants such as ''[[Carcharocles]]'' and the famous ''[[Megalodon]]''&lt;ref name=guy/&gt; (which is often included in ''Carcharocles'').

The ancestral [[baleen whale]] ''[[Eobalaenoptera harrisoni]]'' and the [[merganser]] ''Mergus miscellus'' were described from the Virginian part of the formation. From the uppermost layer, deposited 15–14 Ma, they represent the oldest known member of their [[family (biology)|family]] and [[genus]], respectively. Some remains of a prehistoric [[loon]] (''Gavia'') from the lowermost parts of the Calvert Formation, dating back nearly 18 Ma, are the oldest records of that genus from North America, and among the oldest worldwide.

Other notable baleen whales from this area include a ''[[Cephalotropis|Cephalotropis coronatus]]''. One was discovered by hobbyist paleontologist Jeffery DiMeglio in 2004 after cliff erosion caused by [[Hurricane Isabel]] exposed the skull and scapula.&lt;ref name=hurricane/&gt; Mandibles, neck vertebrae, and scapulae were also found during the dig. The skull and vertebrae are on display at the [[Calvert Marine Museum]].&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; Other items found in the field jackets of the whale were fish bones, hundreds of mollusks, a ''[[Hexanchus|Hexanchus gigas]]'' tooth, and two ''[[Carcharodon|Carcharodon hastalis]]'' teeth.

==Social history==
On his 1612 map, [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]] identified the area as "Rickard's Cliffes," having given them his mother's family's name.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=journal/&gt; Some 350 years later, the state park was developed with the General Assembly funding land purchases in each year from 1965 to 1968, then in 1969, dedicating money to the installation of the park's initial roads, parking area, and utilities.&lt;ref name=authorization/&gt;

==Industrial neighbors==
The [[Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant]] is located a short distance north of the park. The [[Dominion Cove Point LNG|Dominion Cove Point]] [[liquid natural gas]] receiving station is visible off shore from the park beach.

==Activities and amenities==
Calvert Cliffs State Park is mostly forested, with some wetland areas and a small pond for fishing. The park has {{convert|13|mi}} of marked hiking trails. A quarter-mile-long sandy beach is accessible via a {{convert|1.8|mi|adj=on}} trail. Some 550 acres are open to hunting upland game, turkey, and deer.&lt;ref name=mdnr/&gt; The park is rich in biodiversity and is home to numerous species of plants and animals, with at least 163 species of birds observed in the park.&lt;ref name=ebird/&gt;

The '''Cape Nelson State Park''', near [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]] on [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'s southwest coast is a {{convert|243|ha|adj=on}} state park.&lt;ref name=PV&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape Nelson State Park|url=http://parkweb.vic.gov.au/explore/parks/cape-nelson-state-park|work=Official website|publisher=[[Parks Victoria]]|accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attractions include a {{convert|3|km|0|adj=on}} clifftop walk and a visit to the Cape Nelson lighthouse. The lighthouse was completed in 1884 and today offers accommodation in the Light Station Keepers Cottages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/travel/destinations/2010/07/australias-iconic-lighthouses/ Australia’s iconic lighthouses], Australian Geographic, 26 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the route of the [[Great South West Walk]] is located within the park.&lt;ref name=chapman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.john.chapman.name/vic-gsww.html|title=Great South West Walk|work=Victorian bushwalking|author=Chapman, John|location=Laburnum|publisher=John Chapman|date=9 October 2011|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fauna include the [[Heath Mouse]], [[Red-necked Wallaby]] and [[Echidna]]. The main vegetation types are listed as [[Soap Mallee]], [[Heath (habitat)|Heath]] and [[Wet Heath]].

The Cape Nelson lighthouse featured in the 2010 romantic drama ''[[South Solitary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Cape%20Nelson,%20Victoria,%20Australia Film Titles With Location Matching "Cape Nelson, Victoria, Australia"]. International Movie Data Base (IMDb), retrieved 25 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The film provides good coverage of the interior of the lighthouse, cottage features and the landscape.

In [[petrology]], the [[mineral]] [[clinopyroxene]] is used for [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] calculations of the [[magma]] that produced [[igneous rock]] containing this mineral. '''Clinopyroxene thermobarometry''' is one of several [[geothermobarometry|geothermobarometers]].

A '''cold cathode'''&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|1993187}}, Cold cathode discharge tube&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[cathode]] that is not electrically heated by a [[Electrical filament|filament]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A negatively charged [[electrode]] emits [[electron]]s or is the positively charged terminal. For more, see [[field emission]].&lt;/ref&gt; A cathode may be considered "cold" if it emits more electrons than can be supplied by [[thermionic emission]] alone. It is used in [[Gas discharge lamp|gas-discharge lamps]], such as [[neon lamp]]s, [[discharge tube]]s, and some types of [[vacuum tube]]. The other type of cathode is a [[hot cathode]], which is heated by electric current passing through a [[Electrical filament|filament]]. A cold cathode does not necessarily operate at a low temperature: it is often heated to its [[operating temperature]] by other methods, such as the current passing from the cathode into the gas.

==Cold-cathode devices==
[[Image:ZM1210-operating edit2.jpg|thumb|upright|

A cold-cathode vacuum tube does not rely on external heating of an electrode to provide [[thermionic emission]] of electrons. Early cold-cathode devices included the [[Geissler tube]] and [[Julius Plücker|Plucker tube]], and early [[cathode ray tube]]s.  Study of the phenomena in these devices led to the discovery of the electron.

[[Neon lamp]]s are used both to produce light as indicators and for special-purpose illumination, and also as circuit elements displaying [[negative resistance]]. Addition of a trigger electrode to a device allowed the glow discharge to be initiated by an external control circuit; [[Bell Laboratories]] developed a "trigger tube" cold-cathode device in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Neale, ''Cold Cathode Tube Circuit Design'', Francis and Taylor, 1964. pp. 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many types of cold-cathode switching tube were developed, including various types of [[thyratron]], the [[krytron]], cold-cathode displays ([[Nixie tube]]) and others. [[Voltage regulator]] tubes rely on the relatively constant voltage of a [[glow discharge]] over a range of current and were used to stabilize power-supply voltages in tube-based instruments. A [[Dekatron]] is a cold-cathode tube with multiple electrodes that is used for counting.  Each time a pulse is applied to a control electrode, a glow discharge moves to a step electrode; by providing ten electrodes in each tube and cascading the tubes, a counter system can be developed and the count observed by the position of the glow discharges. Counter tubes were used widely before development of [[integrated circuit]] counter devices.

The [[flash tube]] is a cold-cathode device filled with [[xenon]] gas, used to produce an intense short pulse of light for photography or to act as a [[stroboscope]] to examine the motion of moving parts.

===Lamps===
Cold-cathode lamps include [[cold-cathode fluorescent lamp]]s ('''CCFLs''') and [[neon lamp]]s. Neon lamps primarily rely on excitation of gas molecules to emit light; CCFLs use a discharge in mercury vapor to develop ultraviolet light, which in turn causes a [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] coating on the inside of the lamp to emit visible light.

Cold-cathode fluorescent lamps are used for [[backlight]]ing of [[LCD]]s, for example computer monitors and television screens.

In the lighting industry, “cold cathode” historically refers to luminous tubing larger than 20&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and operating on a current of 120 to 240 milliamperes. This larger-diameter tubing is often used for interior alcove and general lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ifay guide info electric discharge lighting systems, cold cathode| url =http://database.ul.com/cgi-bin/XYV/template/LISEXT/1FRAME/showpage.html?name=IFAY.GuideInfo&amp;ccnshorttitle=Electric+Discharge+Lighting+Systems,+Cold+Cathode&amp;objid=1074096534&amp;cfgid=1073741824&amp;version=versionless&amp;parent_id=1073988136&amp;sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EGL lighting products |url=http://www.egl-lighting.com/products.html |accessdate=9 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026042259/http://www.egl-lighting.com/products.html |archivedate=October 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "neon lamp" refers to tubing that is smaller than 15&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter{{cn|date=September 2015}} and typically operates at approximately 40 milliamperes.  These lamps are commonly used for neon signs.

==Details==
The cathode is the negative electrode. Any gas-discharge lamp has a positive (anode) and a negative electrode. Both electrodes alternate between acting as an anode and a cathode when these devices run with [[alternating current]].

[[File:Cold Cathodes.jpg|thumb|A standard computer case fitted with blue and green cold-cathode tubes]]
[[File:Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp.JPG|thumb|Cold-cathode fluorescent lamp]]

A ''cold cathode'' is distinguished from a [[hot cathode]] that is heated to induce [[thermionic emission]] of [[electron]]s. Discharge tubes with hot cathodes have an envelope filled with low-pressure gas and containing two electrodes. Examples are most common [[fluorescent lamp]]s, high-pressure discharge lamps and [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s.

The surface of cold cathodes can emit [[secondary electrons]] at a ratio greater than unity (breakdown).  An electron that leaves the cathode will collide with neutral gas molecules.  The collision may just excite the molecule, but sometimes it will knock an electron free to create a positive ion.  The original electron and the freed electron continue toward the anode and may create more positive ions (see [[Townsend avalanche]]). The result is for each electron that leaves the cathode, several positive ions are generated that eventually crash onto the cathode. Some crashing positive ions may generate a secondary electron. The discharge is self-sustaining when for each electron that leaves the cathode, enough positive ions hit the cathode to free, on average, another electron. External circuitry limits the discharge current.  Cold-cathode discharge lamps use higher voltages than hot-cathode ones. The resulting strong electric field near the cathode accelerates ions to a sufficient velocity to create free electrons from the cathode material.

Another mechanism to generate free electrons from a cold metallic surface is [[field electron emission]]. It is used in some [[x-ray tube]]s, the [[field-emission microscopy|field-electron microscope]] (FEM), and [[field-emission display]]s (FEDs).

Cold cathodes sometimes have a [[rare-earth]] coating to enhance electron emission. Some types contain a source of [[beta radiation]] to start [[ionization]] of the gas that fills the tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|1860149}}, Discharge tube.&lt;/ref&gt; In some tubes, [[glow discharge]] around the cathode is usually minimized; instead there is a so-called positive column, filling the tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|2103033}}, Electron emissive electrode.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|1316967}}, Gaseous-conduction lamp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Positive column is part of a glow discharge, such as in the [[Moore lamp]].&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the [[neon lamp]] and [[nixie tube]]s. Nixie tubes too are cold-cathode neon displays that are in-line, but not in-plane, display devices.

Cold-cathode devices typically use a complex [[high-voltage power supply]] with some mechanism for limiting current. Although creating the initial space charge and the first arc of current through the tube may require a very high voltage, once the tube begins to heat up, the electrical resistance drops, thus increasing the [[electric current]] through the lamp. To offset this effect and maintain normal operation, the supply voltage is gradually lowered. In the case of tubes with an ionizing gas, the gas can become a very hot [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], and electrical resistance is greatly reduced. If operated from a simple power supply without current limiting, this reduction in resistance would lead to damage to the power supply and overheating of the tube electrodes.

==Applications==
[[File:Cold-Cathode-CFL-illuminated.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A photo of an illuminated compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) of the cold-cathode variety|An illuminated cold-cathode [[Compact fluorescent lamp|CFL]]]]

Cold cathodes are used in [[cold-cathode rectifier]]s, such as the [[crossatron]] and [[mercury-arc valve]]s, and [[cold-cathode amplifier]]s, such as in [[automatic message accounting]] and other [[pseudospark switch]]ing applications. Other examples include the [[thyratron]], [[krytron]], [[sprytron]], and [[ignitron]] tubes.

A common cold-cathode application is in [[neon sign]]s and other locations where the ambient temperature is likely to drop well below freezing, The [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster]] (Big Ben) uses cold-cathode lighting behind the clock faces where continual striking and failure to strike in cold weather would be undesirable. Large cold-cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) have been produced in the past and are still used today when shaped, long-life linear light sources are required. {{As of|2011}}, miniature CCFLs were extensively used as [[backlight]]s for [[computer]] and television [[liquid-crystal display]]s. CCFL lifespans vary in LCD televisions depending on transient voltage surges and temperature levels in usage environments.

Due to its efficiency, CCFL technology has expanded into room lighting. Costs are similar to those of traditional [[fluorescent lighting]],{{Clarify|date=August 2011|reason=is this cost of lamps, running cost, total cost?}} but with several advantages: the light emitted is {{clarify span|easier on the eyes|what?|date=October 2017}}, bulbs turn on instantly to full output and are also dimmable.&lt;ref name="Solé Lighting"&gt;[http://solelighting.com/ Solé Lighting] (commercial site advocating CCFLs).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of internal heating===
In systems using [[alternating current]] but without separate [[anode]] structures, the electrodes alternate as anodes and cathodes, and the impinging electrons can cause substantial localized heating, often to [[red heat]]. The electrode may take advantage of this heating to facilitate the thermionic emission of electrons when it is acting as a cathode. (''Instant-start'' fluorescent lamps employ this aspect; they start as cold-cathode devices, but soon localized heating of the fine [[tungsten]]-wire cathodes causes them to operate in the same mode as [[hot-cathode]] lamps.)

This aspect is problematic in the case of backlights used for [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] TV displays. New energy-efficiency regulations being proposed in many countries will require variable backlighting; variable backlightling also improves the perceived contrast range, which is desirable for LCD TV sets. However, CCFLs are strictly limited in the degree to which they can be dimmed, both because a lower plasma current will lower the temperature of the cathode, causing erratic operation, and because running the cathode at too low a temperature drastically shortens the life of the lamps.{{cn|date=November 2015}} Much research is being directed to this problem{{By whom|date=August 2013}}, but high-end manufacturers are now turning to high-efficiency white [[LED]]s as a better solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">{{About|an ecological term||Common (disambiguation)}}

'''Common species''' and '''uncommon species''' are designations used in [[ecology]] to describe the population status of a species.  Commonness is closely related to [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]].  Abundance refers to the frequency with which a species is found in controlled samples; in contrast, species are defined as common or uncommon based on their overall presence in the environment.  A species may be locally abundant without being common.

However, "common" and "uncommon" are also sometimes used to describe levels of abundance, with a common species being less abundant than an abundant species, while an uncommon species is more abundant than a rare species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/birds/stcroix/methods.htm|work=Birds of the St. Croix River Valley: Minnesota and Wisconsin|title=Methods, Terminology, and Nomenclature|author=Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center|accessdate=2006-12-31|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222235623/http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/birds/stcroix/methods.htm|archivedate=2006-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common species are frequently regarded as being at low risk of extinction simply because they exist in large numbers, and hence their conservation status is often overlooked. While this is broadly logical, there are several cases of once common species being driven to extinction such as the [[passenger pigeon]] and the [[Rocky Mountain locust]], which numbered in the billions and trillions respectively before their demise. Moreover, a small proportional decline in a common species results in the loss of a large number of individuals, and the contribution to ecosystem function that those individuals represented. A recent paper argued that because common species shape ecosystems, contribute disproportionately to ecosystem functioning, and can show rapid population declines, conservation should look more closely at how the trade-off between species extinctions and the depletion of populations.&lt;ref name=gaston&gt;Gaston, K.J. &amp; Fuller, R.A. 2008. Commonness, population depletion and conservation biology. Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 23, 14-19. {{doi|10.1016/j.tree.2007.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cosmic wind''' is a powerful [[Cosmos|cosmic]] force that can push interstellar dust clouds of low density into intergalactic [[Outer space|space]].  Although it easily pushes low density gas and dust clouds, it can not easily push high density clouds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3153">In [[Yolngu]] mythology, the '''Djanggawul''' are three siblings, two female and one male, who created the landscape of [[Australia]] and covered it with [[flora (plants)|flora]]. They came from the island of [[Baralku]], and were eventually eaten by [[Galeru]].  The two female Djanggawul made the world's sacred [[Amulet|talisman]]s by breaking off pieces of their [[vulva]]s. They included Bunbulama, a rain goddess.

The Djanggawul myth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Wells, A.E. | title =This their dreaming | year =1971 | publisher= UQ Press, St.Lucia,Qld}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author =Ronald M.

The humans born of the two sisters are the ancestors of the Dua clans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Oliver, Douglas L. | title = Oceania: The Native Cultures of Australia and the Pacific Islands |year=1989 | publisher= University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu }}&lt;/ref&gt; the animals the sisters created are the totem animals of those clans, and the places the sisters visited are the clan shrines.

The mythology was staged in early contact times by the Dhuwa ("Dua") during several days of dancing, singing, and the manipulation of sacred emblems, on a stage of man-made holes and earth sculpture. The other aboriginal [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|moiety]] of the region, the Yirritja ("Yiritja"), also participated in the dramatization of the Djanggawul myth, although some of the rites were accessible only to initiated Dua males.  Oliver, following Berndt 1952, argues that the Djanggawul cycle is a dramatic enactment of Arnhem Land's monsoon cycle, which shaped aboriginal food procurement activities.  Oliver says, "This is not to say that a dramatic presentation was needed to familiarize the Arnhemlanders with the stark reality of their monsoon climate, and of its direct effects upon their lives; about that they were deeply aware.  What the rituals did was to rationalize that climate in mythical terms (a reassuring thing in itself) and to provide them with a doubtless satisfying means of attempting to insure the regular recurrence of the rains.  For no matter how discomforting the climate of the rainy season may have been ... the Arnhemlanders evidently recognized how essential it was for sustaining the only life they knew." (1989:169)

'''''El Naddaha''''' ({{lang-ar|النداهة}}) (translated: the caller) is a modern legend concerning [[female]] [[naiad]]-like [[genie]] (ginneyya in [[Egyptian Arabic]]), who calls men to the [[Nile]], most likely to their deaths. It is well known in the [[Nile Delta]], the [[north]]ern [[agricultural]]-based area of [[Egypt]], typically north to [[Cairo]], where the Nile is prominent.

== History ==
The origin and place of the legend is unknown. The story became popular around the 1950s where Egypt was less [[Urban area|urban]] than it is now, and people would spend more time closer to the Nile. Children would play by its shores after school had released them, and young men would chat there at night. It has become less popular at present though it's still familiar to the youth.

== Description ==
El Naddaha takes the form of stunningly beautiful woman who appears, as if by chance, to men walking by the Nile at night. The men are usually a pair. The creature calls one by his first name, rendering him speechless, [[hypnotized]], and obedient to her voice which he blindly follows, while the other man is unaffected, and attempts to pull the other back. The creature calls in a soft, sleepy, hypnotizing voice until the second unaffected man succeeds at last in reviving the called man from his trance. The two run away as fast as they can, hearing her voice still echoing as they run.

Usually the men do not get close enough to the Nile to get a glimpse of what the creature before they run away. In rare instances, they get a glimpse of her. She is described as being a very beautiful white female; tall, slender, with long flowing hair down her back. She stands steadily very near to the bank of the river, her hands placed at her sides, and wearing a loose, long semi-transparent dress. In many instances she's described as having a semi-transparent body and possibly a [[genie]]. Her voice is calm and soft, yet loud.&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of El Naddaha'', by the Egyptian novelist [[Ahmed Khaled Towfik]]; an Egyptian novel writer; Original Page: [[List of titles of Ma Waraa Al Tabiaa series]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20at.com/newArticle.php?sid=955عشرينات عفاريت شبرامنت] {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montada.arahman.net/showthread.php?t=1823 A poem based on the El Naddaha legend] {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rewayatnet.net/forum/archive/index.php/t-865.html Discussion on the Legend of El Naddaha in a public Egyptian forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515012815/http://www.rewayatnet.net/forum/archive/index.php/t-865.html |date=2009-05-15 }} {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rural Egypt, the creature may call for men in their homes by the shores of the Nile, who then eagerly attempt to leave home for her. In other tales, the affected man will not immediately try to follow; rather enter a state of disturbed distraction for a few nights before at least departing late at night. People in rural Egypt believe that a man who is called for by El Naddaha is doomed, curing him from the curse is impossible, and the process irreversible. Not a single instance has been recorded where a man is seen devoured by her. But many old local citizens believe she consumes or fiercely pulls her victims into the Nile and drowns them. 

[[Ahmed Khaled Towfik]] in his ''The Legend of Al Naddaha'', says that a man who prevents the called man from reaching the creature by any means would be the next to be called.

{{Environmental law}}

'''Emission standards ''' &lt;section begin=overview /&gt;&lt;!-- this paragraph is transcluded to [[air quality law]] --&gt;are the legal requirements governing [[Air pollution|air pollutants]] released into the [[atmosphere]]. Emission standards set quantitative limits on the permissible amount of specific [[Air pollution|air pollutants]] that may be released from specific sources over specific timeframes. They are generally designed to achieve air quality standards and to protect human life.&lt;section end=overview /&gt;

== Regulated sources ==
Many emissions standards focus on regulating pollutants released by [[Motor vehicle emissions|automobiles]] (motor cars) and other powered [[vehicle]]s. Others regulate emissions from [[industry]], power plants, small equipment such as lawn mowers and diesel [[electrical generator|generators]], and other sources of [[air pollution]].

==Vehicle emission performance standard==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2009}}
An '''emission performance standard''' is a limit that sets thresholds above which a different type of emission control technology might be needed.  While emission performance standards have been used to dictate limits for conventional [[pollutants]] such as [[oxides of nitrogen]] and [[Lower sulfur oxides|oxides of sulphur]] (NOx and SOx),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emissions.org/publications/member_articles/ef9ema.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120153824/http://www.emissions.org/publications/member_articles/ef9ema.pdf|date=November 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; this regulatory technique may be used to regulate [[greenhouse gas]]ses, particularly [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In the US, this is given in pounds of carbon dioxide per [[Watt-hour|megawatt-hour]] (lbs. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MWhr), and kilograms CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MWhr elsewhere.

==North America==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999) transfers the legislative authority for regulating emissions from on-road vehicles and engines to [[Environment Canada]] from Transport Canada's Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
The Regulations align emission standards with the U.S. federal standards and apply to light-duty vehicles (e.g., passenger cars), light-duty trucks (e.g., vans, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles), heavy-duty vehicles (e.g., trucks and buses), heavy-duty engines and motorcycles.&lt;ref name="Vehicle and Engine Regulations"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/air/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=AE4ECEC1-1 |title=Vehicle and Engine Regulations|publisher=Environment Canada|date=Jul 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
{{Main article|United States emission standards}}

The United States has its own set of emissions standards that all new vehicles must meet.  In the [[United States]], emissions standards are managed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).  Under federal law, the state of [[California]] is allowed to promulgate more stringent vehicle emissions standards (subject to EPA approval), and other states may choose to follow either the national or California standards.  California had produced air quality standards prior to EPA, with severe [[Los Angeles#Environmental issues|air quality problems in the Los Angeles]] metropolitan area.  LA is the country's second-largest city, and relies much more heavily on automobiles and has less favorable meteorological conditions than the largest and third-largest cities (New York and Chicago).

California's emissions standards are set by the [[California Air Resources Board]], known locally by its acronym "CARB".  By mid-2009, 16 other states had adopted CARB rules;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/fuel-economy/carb4.htm|title=How the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Works|author=|date=12 September 2008|website=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; given the size of the California market plus these other states, many manufacturers choose to build to the CARB standard when selling in all 50 states.  CARB's policies have also influenced EU emissions standards.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

California is attempting to regulate [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from automobiles, but faces a court challenge from the federal government.  The states are also attempting to compel the federal EPA to regulate [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, which as of 2007 it has declined to do.  On May 19, 2009 [http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-emissions19-2009may19,0,5567325.story news reports] indicate that the Federal EPA will largely adopt California's standards on greenhouse gas emissions.

California and several other western states have passed bills requiring [[performance-based regulation]] of greenhouse gases from electricity generation.

In an effort to decrease emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines faster, the [[California Air Resources Board]]'s [[Carl Moyer Program]] funds upgrades that are in advance of regulations.

The EPA has separate regulations for small engines, such as [[groundskeeping equipment]].  The states must also promulgate miscellaneous emissions regulations in order to comply with the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]].

==Europe==

===European Union===
{{Main article|European emission standards}}
The European Union has its own set of emissions standards that all new vehicles must meet. Currently, standards are set for all road vehicles, trains, barges and 'nonroad mobile machinery' (such as tractors). No standards apply to seagoing ships or airplanes.

EU Regulation No 443/2009 sets an average CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions target for new passenger cars of 130 grams per kilometre. The target was gradually phased in between 2012 and 2015. A target of 95 grams per kilometre will apply from 2021.

For light commercial vehicle, an emissions target of 175 g/km applies from 2017, and 147 g/km from 2020,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theicct.org/eu-co2-standards-passenger-cars-and-lcvs|author=International Council on Clean Transportation |title=EU CO2 standards for passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles|date=January 2014|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reduction of 16%.

The EU introduced Euro 4 effective January 1, 2008, Euro 5 effective January 1, 2010 and Euro 6 effective January 1, 2014. These dates had been postponed for two years to give oil refineries the opportunity to modernize their plants.

==Asia==

===China===

{{See also|Energy policy of China}}
Due to rapidly expanding wealth and prosperity, the number of [[coal power plant]]s and cars on China's roads is rapidly growing, creating an ongoing pollution problem.  China enacted its first emissions controls on automobiles in 2000, equivalent to Euro I standards.  China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) upgraded emission controls again on July 1, 2004 to the Euro II standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-07/07/content_346332.htm |title=China to adopt auto emission standard equal to Euro III in 2008 |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date=2004-07-07 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; More stringent emission standard, National Standard III, equivalent to Euro III standards, went into effect on July 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/2946/2007/07/02/176@244647.htm |title=China Launches Tougher Auto Emission Standard |publisher=English.cri.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plans were for Euro IV standards to take effect in 2010.

===Hong Kong===
{{See also|Air pollution in Hong Kong}}
From Jan 1, 2006, all new passenger cars with spark-ignition engines in [[Hong Kong]] must meet either Euro IV petrol standard, Japanese Heisei 17 standard or US EPA Tier 2 Bin 5 standard. For new passenger cars with compression-ignition engines, they must meet US EPA Tier 2 Bin 5 standard.

===India===
{{Main article|Bharat Stage emission standards}}

Bharat stage emission standards are emission standards instituted by the Government of India to regulate the output of air pollutants from internal combustion engine equipment, including motor vehicles. The standards and the timeline for implementation are set by the Central Pollution Control Board under the Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests.

The standards, based on European regulations were first introduced in 2000. Progressively stringent norms have been rolled out since then. All new vehicles manufactured after the implementation of the norms have to be compliant with the regulations. By 2014, the country was under a combination of Euro 3 and Euro 4-based norms, with Euro 4 standards partly  implemented in 13 major cities. As of April 2017, the entire country was under BS IV norms, which is based on Euro 4. It is planned that manufacture and registration of BS IV vehicles will be ceased, by April 2020 and June 2020, respectively&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/auto/miscellaneous/no-bs-iv-vehicle-registrations-beyond-june-2020-draft-rules/amp_articleshow/61901273.cms|title=No BS-IV vehicle registrations beyond June 2020: Draft rules - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Skipping Euro 5, BS VI (based on Euro 6) will be introduced across the country by the April 1, 2020.

===Japan===
''' Background '''

Starting June 10, 1968, the Japanese Government passed the '''({{lang-ja|[[:ja:大気汚染防止法|Air Pollution Control Act]]}})''' which regulated all sources of air pollutants. As a result of the 1968 law, dispute resolutions were passed under the 1970 '''({{lang-ja|[[:ja:公害紛争処理法|Air Pollution Dispute Resolution Act]]}})'''. As a result of the 1970 law, in 1973 the first installment of four sets of new emissions standards were introduced. Interim standards were introduced on January 1, 1975 and again for 1976. The final set of standards were introduced for 1978.&lt;ref name="WC79j"&gt;{{Citation | first = Jack K. | last = Yamaguchi | editor-last = Lösch | editor-first = Annamaria | journal = World Cars 1979 | title = The Year of Uncertainty? | publisher = The Automobile Club of Italy/Herald Books | location = Pelham, NY | pages = 61–62 | year = 1979 | isbn = 0-910714-11-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the standards were introduced they were not made immediately mandatory, instead tax breaks were offered for cars which passed them.&lt;ref name="WC77j"&gt;{{Citation | first = Jack K. | last = Yamaguchi | journal = World Cars 1977 | title = The Year of the Third Power | publisher = The Automobile Club of Italy/Herald Books | location = Pelham, NY | page = 54 | year = 1977 | isbn = 0-910714-09-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards were based on those adopted by the original [[Clean Air Act (United States)|US Clean Air Act]] of 1970, but the test cycle included more slow city driving to correctly reflect the Japanese situation.&lt;ref name="WC78j"&gt;{{Citation | first = Jack K. | last = Yamaguchi | editor-last = Lösch | editor-first = Annamaria | journal = World Cars 1978 | title = Successes- Excesses | publisher = The Automobile Club of Italy/Herald Books | location = Pelham, NY | page = 61 | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-910714-10-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1978 limits for ''mean emissions'' during a "Hot Start Test" of CO, hydrocarbons, and NOx were {{convert|2.1|g/km|g/mi|2}} of CO, {{convert|.25|g/km|g/mi|2}} of HC, and {{convert|.25|g/km|g/mi|2}} of NOx respectively.&lt;ref name="WC78j"/&gt; Maximum limits are {{convert|2.7|g/km|g/mi|2}} of CO, {{convert|.39|g/km|g/mi|2}} of HC, and {{convert|.48|g/km|g/mi|2}} of NOx.

In 1992, to cope with NOx pollution problems from existing vehicle fleets in highly populated metropolitan areas, the Ministry of the Environment adopted the '''“({{lang-ja|[[:ja:自動車から排出される窒素酸化物及び粒子状物質の特定地域における総量の削減等に関する特別措置法|Law Concerning Special Measures to Reduce the Total Amount of Nitrogen Oxides Emitted from Motor Vehicles in Specified Areas]]}})”,''' called in short The Motor Vehicle NOx Law. The regulation designated a total of 196 communities in the Tokyo, Saitama, Kanagawa, Osaka and Hyogo Prefectures as areas with significant air pollution due to nitrogen oxides emitted from motor vehicles. Under the Law, several measures had to be taken to control NOx from in-use vehicles, including enforcing emission standards for specified vehicle categories.

The regulation was amended in June 2001 to tighten the existing NOx requirements and to add PM control provisions. The amended rule is called the “Law Concerning Special Measures to Reduce the Total Amount of Nitrogen Oxides and Particulate Matter Emitted from Motor Vehicles in Specified Areas”, or in short the Automotive NOx and PM Law.

;Emission Standards

The NOx and PM Law introduces emission standards for specified categories of in-use highway vehicles including commercial goods (cargo) vehicles such as trucks and vans, buses, and special purpose motor vehicles, irrespective of the fuel type. The regulation also applies to diesel powered passenger cars (but not to gasoline cars).

In-use vehicles in the specified categories must meet 1997/98 emission standards for the respective new vehicle type (in the case of heavy duty engines NOx = 4.5 g/kWh, PM = 0.25 g/kWh). In other words, the 1997/98 new vehicle standards are retroactively applied to older vehicles already on the road. Vehicle owners have two methods to comply:

# Replace old vehicles with newer, cleaner models
# Retrofit old vehicles with approved NOx and PM control devices

Vehicles have a grace period, between 8 and 12 years from the initial registration, to comply. The grace period depends on the vehicle type, as follows:
* Light commercial vehicles (GVW ≤ 2500&amp;nbsp;kg): 8 years
* Heavy commercial vehicles (GVW &gt; 2500&amp;nbsp;kg): 9 years
* Micro buses (11-29 seats): 10 years
* Large buses (≥ 30 seats): 12 years
* Special vehicles (based on a cargo truck or bus): 10 years
* Diesel passenger cars: 9 years

Furthermore, the regulation allows fulfillment of its requirements to be postponed by an additional 0.5-2.5 years, depending on the age of the vehicle. This delay was introduced in part to harmonize the NOx and PM Law with the Tokyo diesel retrofit program.

The NOx and PM Law is enforced in connection with Japanese vehicle inspection program, where non-complying vehicles cannot undergo the inspection in the designated areas. This, in turn, may trigger an injunction on the vehicle operation under the Road Transport Vehicle Law.

===Israel===
Since January 2012 vehicles which do not comply with Euro 6 emission values are not allowed to be imported to Israel.

===Turkey===
Most of the time Turkey follows EU legislations one step behind, but currently Euro6 for new types of light duty and heavy duty commercial vehicles, and also for passenger cars.

==Africa==

===South Africa===
South Africa’s first clean fuels programme was implemented in 2006 with the banning of lead from petrol and the reduction of sulphur levels in diesel from 3 000 parts per million (ppm) to 500ppm, along with a niche grade of 50ppm.

The Clean Fuels 2 standard, expected to begin in 2017, includes the reduction of sulphur to 10ppm; the lowering of benzene from 5 percent to 1 percent of volume; the reduction of aromatics from 50 percent to 35 percent of volume; and the specification of olefins at 18 percent of volume.

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===
Australian emission standards are based on European regulations for light-duty and heavy-duty (heavy goods) vehicles, with acceptance of selected US and Japanese standards. The current policy is to fully harmonize Australian regulations with United Nations (UN) and Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) standards. In November 2013, the first stage of the stringent Euro 5 emission standards for light vehicles was introduced, which includes cars and light commercial vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://infrastructure.gov.au/roads/environment/emission/index.aspx|title=Vehicle Emission Standards|last=Services|first=Department of Transport and Regional|website=infrastructure.gov.au|access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of emission standards for highway vehicles and engines is coordinated by the National Transport Commission (NTC) and the regulations—Australian Design Rules (ADR)—are administered by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dieselnet.com/standards/au/|title=Emission Standards: Australia: On-Road Vehicles and Engines|website=www.dieselnet.com|access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All new vehicles manufactured or sold in the country must comply with the standards, which are tested by running the vehicle or engine in a standardized test cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/australias-weaker-emissions-standards-allow-car-makers-to-dump-polluting-cars-48172|title=Australia's weaker emissions standards allow car makers to 'dump' polluting cars|last=Mortimore|first=Anna|newspaper=The Conversation|access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy liberalisation''' refers to the [[liberalisation]] of [[electricity market|energy market]]s, with specific reference to [[electricity generation]] markets, by bringing greater competition into electricity and gas markets in the interest of creating more [[competitive market]]s and reductions in price by [[Privatization|privatisation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Energy Liberalisation from Financial Times Lexicon|url = http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=energy-liberalisation|website = lexicon.ft.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the supply of electricity is a [[natural monopoly]], this entails complex and costly systems of [[regulation]] to enforce a system of [[competition]].&lt;ref name=thomas2004&gt;{{cite web|title=Electricity liberalisation: The beginning of the end |author=Steve Thomas |publisher=PRSIRU |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url=http://www.psiru.org/reports/2004-09-E-WEC.doc |date=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717040912/http://www.psiru.org/reports/2004-09-E-WEC.doc |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong drive for liberalisation occurred in [[European Union]] energy markets at the turn of the millennium, directed by [[European Commission]] directives favouring market liberalisation promulgated in 1996, 2003, and 2009.&lt;ref name=thomas2004 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DIRECTIVE 2009/72/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL |date=13 July 2009 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:211:0055:0093:EN:PDF |publisher=Official Journal of the European Union |author=European Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = European Commission - Competition - Energy - Overview|url = http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/energy/overview_en.html|website = ec.europa.eu|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programmes were supported with the interest of increasing the interconnectedness of European energy markets and building the common market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similar initiatives, to varying degrees, have been pursued in nations around the world, such as Argentina, Chile, and the United States.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== British Model ==

A standard model for electricity liberalisation is the "British model", a reform plan of which consists of six reforms: (1) creation of a competitive market for electricity, (2) the breakup of monopolized supply such that each consumer can select their provider, (3) separation of network maintenance from generation, (4) separation of direct supply from the generation of electricity, (5) creation of an incentive structure to set market prices in monopolistic competition, and (6) the privatisation of formerly state-owned assets.&lt;ref name=thomas2005&gt;{{cite web |title=
British Experience of Electricity Liberalisation: A Model for India? |jstor=4417518 |publisher=Economic and Political Weekly |author=Stephen Thomas |date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was implemented under the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] years as part of a mass privatisation campaign of many of the industries nationalised by previous [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] governments in the preceding decades. The risks involved for both [[Electricity generation|generators]] and [[Electricity distribution|distributors]] have led to vertical re-integration.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Benefits of liberalisation ==
The main benefit of liberalisation comes from the increased competition afforded to the market. This increases the availability and distribution of energy in supply situations by building transparent price signals and diversifying the production of electricity between [[Natural gas|gas]]-turbine technologies to [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/LessonsNet.pdf|title = Lessons from Liberalised Electricity Markets|date = 2005|accessdate = 2015-10-28|website = |publisher = International Energy Agency|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also led to the elimination of unnecessary overhead supply in formerly nationalised markets, allowing for capital resources to be utilised more effectively on things such as network infrastructure instead of maintaining idle power stations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These increases in efficiency have led to lower prices paid by consumers in nations, such as the [[United Kingdom]], which have more heavily pursued [[deregulation]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.economist.com/node/5492109|title = The politics of power|last = |first = |date = 9 February 2006|work = |access-date = 28 October 2015|via = |publisher = [[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of pooled energy sources per the British model and other systems adopted in Chile and Texas have led to greater demand [[Elasticity (economics)|price-response]], allowing for the more efficient use of electricity and increasing the response of consumers to prices so fewer costs are afforded to them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, the greater interconnectedness of networks has allowed for markets to be more able to respond to peak energy demand and thereby increase the security of energy networks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

By increasing price-response, providing for more efficient companies, and increasing the visibility of price signals, governments have also been able to reduce the pollution from fossil-fuel power stations by concurrently securing greater environmental protections. Further progress has been made in shaving overcapacity such that less emissions are emitted whilst still maintaining energy security and building the transmission infrastructure necessary to better exploit wind and solar resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Problems with liberalisation ==
Liberalisation of electricity tends to substantially benefit large consumers (mainly industrial users), but benefits for domestic consumers compared with a public monopoly or a regulated private monopoly are questionable, as liberalisation has been shown to pass on supply costs onto consumers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web |title=
Electricity liberalisation in Britain: the quest for a satisfactory wholesale market design |url=http://www.uea.ac.uk/~e680/energy/energy_links/electricity/D13.2_Newbery.pdf |publisher=University of East Anglia |accessdate=27 October 2015 |author=David Newbery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Energy liberalisation leads to higher prices|url = http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/29869d28-7fe1-11dc-b075-0000779fd2ac.html|newspaper = [[Financial Times]]|date = 2007-10-21|access-date = 2015-10-28|issn = 0307-1766|first = Philip|last = Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also doubts over whether the system can ensure long-term security of supply through providing sufficient incentives to begin building generation capacity in time for when it is needed, an issue which has started to plague Britain in the mid-2010s as spare capacity has decreased significantly to just over 1.2 percent in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-33527967 |title=Electricity blackouts risk up, says National Grid |accessdate=27 October 2015 |author=John Moylan |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the experience of electricity liberalisation in [[developing countries]] has proven problematic, as many large multinationals withdrew support for power plant construction projects in the start of the 21st century, leaving countries such as Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uganda to pick up the bill for the expansion of their electric networks.&lt;ref name=thomas2004 /&gt; The privatisation of electricity favoured by liberal economists mirroring the British model have also led to increased expenditure on advertising and power switching incentives for consumers.&lt;ref name="thomas2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name=thomas2005 /&gt;

The nature of the [[natural monopoly]] coming from electricity generation is also an issue which has gone unaddressed. Because of the monopolistic competition inherent to the energy market, there are significant issues with [[collusion]] by firms to raise prices.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; To prevent these issues as well as those associated with direct intervention to build new generation capacity, governments have had to step in to further regulate and build such capacity directly,&lt;ref name="thomas2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; effectively defeating the point of liberalisation. These issues have been compounded with growing geopolitical instability in Eastern Europe and [[Ukraine–European Union relations|concerns]] over gas pipelines in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lower cost, especially when replacing wood that would otherwise have been imported, is a key advantage.&lt;ref name=ACIAR&gt;{{cite book|title=Silvicultural management of bamboo in the Philippines and Australia for shoots and timber|publisher=Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research|author=Merlyn Carmelita N.

However, bamboo is not as resilient as most woods and will decay more rapidly than other woods if not treated with preservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Preservation of bamboo structures|journal=Ghana Journal of Forestry|volume=15|page=156|year=2004|author=W Liese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New building methods have had to be developed for engineered bamboo as its properties are sufficiently different, and make normal wood-working methods used with (non-engineered) bamboo unsuitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=\"Work in Progress – Pushover Test of Bamboo Portal Frame Structure\" |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228451834_Work_in_Progress-Pushover_Test_of_Bamboo_Portal_Frame_Structure |author1=Bhavna Sharma|author2=Kent A. Harries|author3=Khosrow Ghavami|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to overcome the typical loss of strength bamboo incurs when bending takes place post-harvest, an alternative method to overcome this has been developed.

Pre-harvest bending of the bamboo stems in zig-zags, allows the bamboo to later form a [[Warren truss]].&lt;ref&gt;
Cassandra Adams.
[http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/bamboo.html "Bamboo Architecture and Construction with Oscar Hidalgo"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Vittouris has proposed a much simpler 2D S-bend shape, which — after harvesting, and in sufficient quantities — could be assembled into a variety of 3D shapes. The [[arboriculture]] technique used to make both shapes is similar to [[tree shaping]], and result in parts similar to [[knee (construction)]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Enrico Mattei''' (April 29, 1906 &amp;ndash; October 27, 1962) was an [[Italy|Italian]] public administrator.  After World War&amp;nbsp;II he was given the task of dismantling the Italian Petroleum Agency [[Agip]], a state enterprise established by the [[Italian fascism|Fascist]] regime. Instead Mattei enlarged and reorganized it into the National Fuel Trust, ''[[Eni|Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi]]'' (ENI). Under his direction ENI negotiated important oil concessions in the Middle East as well as a significant trade agreement with the [[Soviet Union]] which helped break the [[oligopoly]] of the '[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]' that dominated the mid 20th century [[petroleum industry|oil industry]]. He also introduced the principle whereby the country that owned exploited [[oil reserves]] received 75% of the profits.&lt;ref name=time021162&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874635,00.html#ixzz1DAuoOBYh Italy: Powerful Man], Time Magazine, November 2, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Mattei, who became a powerful figure in Italy, was a [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]], and a member of parliament from 1948 to 1953. Mattei made ENI a powerful company, so much so that Italians called it "the state within the state."&lt;ref name=time210761&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897847,00.html#ixzz1DAsDs8Ay Oil: State Within a State], Time Magazine, July 21, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; He died in a plane crash in 1962, likely caused by a bomb in the plane organized by the British secret service.&lt;ref name=ind290897&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/autopsy-may-solve-deadly-mystery-of-the-mattei-affair-1247785.html Autopsy may solve deadly mystery of the Mattei Affair], The Independent, August 29, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The unsolved death of Mattei has obsessed Italy for years and was the subject of an award-winning film ''[[The Mattei Affair]]'' by [[Francesco Rosi]] in 1972.

==Early life==
Enrico Mattei was born in [[Acqualagna]], in the [[province of Pesaro and Urbino]], [[Marche]], as the second of five children of Antonio Mattei (a ''[[Carabinieri|carabiniere]]'' – a member of the Italian national [[gendarmerie]]) and Angela Galvani.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E11FD35551A7B93CAAB178BD95F468685F9 Italian Oil Chief Dies In Air Crash], The New York Times, October 28, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ENIbio&gt;[http://www.eni.com/en_IT/attachments/azienda/storia/enrico-mattei/Mattei_1_Complete_Biography.pdf Biography of Enrico Mattei] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315171209/http://www.eni.com/en_IT/attachments/azienda/storia/enrico-mattei/Mattei_1_Complete_Biography.pdf |date=2012-03-15 }}, on the ENI website (retrieved September 10, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, he became an apprentice in the [[tannery]] industry in [[Matelica]]. His career was rapid; from factory hand he quickly moved on to become a chemical assistant and then to laboratory chief at the age of 21. After his military service he became the tannery owner’s chief assistant. However, the economic crisis at the end of the 1920s made business going from bad to worse until the tannery closed.&lt;ref name=ENIbio/&gt;

Mattei moved to Milan where he worked as a sales representative for foreign companies in tanning dyes and solvents. In 1931 he became a member of the [[National Fascist Party]] ({{lang-it|Partito Nazionale Fascista}}) created by [[Benito Mussolini]] but was not active in politics. Subsequently he set up a factory producing oil-based emulsifiers for the tanning and textile industries with his brother and sister. In 1934 he founded ''Industria Chimica Lombarda'' and two years later, in 1936, he married Greta Paulas, in Vienna. After acquiring an accountancy qualification, he enrolled at [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore|Università Cattolica]] in Milan.

In May 1943 he met the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] leader [[Giuseppe Spataro]], who introduced him into anti-Fascist circles in Milan against the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime]] of Mussolini. After July 25, 1943, when Mussolini was forced to resign, Mattei joined a partisan group of the [[Italian resistance movement]] in the mountains around Matelica, supplying them with weapons. He was able to join the resistance, despite suspicion over his former membership of the Fascist Party. His role was rather marginal, concentrating mainly on administering and organising activities. After a number of roundups he escaped to Milan.&lt;ref name=ENIbio/&gt;

Impressed by his organisational and military skills, the Christian Democrats put him in command of their partisan forces. On October 26, 1944 he was captured in Milan, along with others, at the Christian Democrats’ secret headquarters in Milan. Detained at the military barracks in [[Como]], he was able to escape on December 3, 1944, taking advantage of a confusion caused by a short circuit which he himself may have engineered. Mattei participated in the North Italian military command of the [[National Liberation Committee]] ({{lang-it|Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale}} - CLN) on behalf of the Christian Democrats.&lt;ref name=ENIbio/&gt; He was decorated by the United States with the [[Silver Star]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;

==Agip and ENI==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}&lt;!--3 paragraphs without citations--&gt;
[[File:Enrico Mattei.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Enrico Mattei during a speech]]
In 1945, the National Liberation Committee appointed him to the leadership of [[Agip]] (Azienda Generale Italiana Petrolio - General Italian Oil Company), the national [[Petroleum|oil]] company created by the [[Fascists]], with instructions to close it as soon as possible. Mattei, instead, worked hard to restructure the company and transform it into one of the nation's most important economic assets.&lt;ref name=time291154&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,857753,00.html State v. Private Capital], Time Magazine, November 29, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 Mattei made an astonishing public announcement: the soil of the Po Valley in Northern Italy was rich in oil and [[methane]], and Italy would solve all its energy needs using its own resources. Through the Italian press, he then encouraged the idea that the nation (still suffering from the consequences of defeat in [[World War II]]), would soon become rich. Agip's financial value immediately grew in the Stock Exchange markets, and the company (owned by the State, but operating as a private company) became at once solid and important. The reality was a little different: in the territory of [[Cortemaggiore]], in the Valley of [[Po River|Po]], a certain amount of methane had been found together with a small quantity of oil.

Mattei’s strategy was to use natural gas to support the development of a national industry in Northern Italy, sustaining the postwar boom known as the "[[Italian economic miracle]]."&lt;ref name=time021162/&gt;&lt;ref name=hayes&gt;[http://www.bakerinstitute.org/publications/algerian-gas-to-europe-the-transmed-pipeline-and-early-spanish-gas-import-projects Algerian Gas to Europe: The Transmed Pipeline and Early Spanish Gas Import Projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504092105/http://bakerinstitute.org/publications/algerian-gas-to-europe-the-transmed-pipeline-and-early-spanish-gas-import-projects |date=2013-05-04 }}, by Mark H. Hayes, May 2004, prepared for the Geopolitics of Natural Gas Study, a joint project of the Program on Energy and Sustainable Development at Stanford University and the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy of Rice University.&lt;/ref&gt; The gas was not a mere substitute for imported oil, but a cheaper and more functional substitute for imported coal which the growing industrial activities relied on. High profits from natural gas sales were plowed back into exploration, production, the expansion of pipelines, and the acquisition of new customers.&lt;ref name=hayes/&gt;

Agip obtained an exclusive concession for gas and [[oil exploration]] within the national territory, and was able to retain the profits. Political views were divided: the leftists supporting him, and the conservatives (together with the industrialists), opposing him. At this time Mattei is alleged to have widely used unofficial financial resources of Agip for extensive bribery, especially of politicians and journalists. He used to say of political parties: "I use them like I would use a taxi: I sit in, I pay for the trip, I get out". Agip gained control of hundreds of companies in all economic fields in the country. Mattei paid great attention to the press, and Agip soon took possession of several newspapers and two agencies.

In 1953 a [[law]] created the [[Eni|ENI]], Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, into which Agip was merged. Mattei was initially its president, then also the administrator and the general director. In practice, Eni was Mattei and Mattei was Eni.

==International influence==
When it became apparent that the domestic resource base would not be sufficient to meet the Italy’s growing energy demand, Mattei recognized the need to secure foreign supplies. Driven by his ambition to make ENI a player on par with the Exxons and Totals of the world, Mattei expanded abroad and turned his attention to the international oil markets.&lt;ref name=hayes/&gt; He invented (or at least, used to tell very often) the story of the little cat: "A little cat arrives where a few big dogs are eating in a pot. The dogs attack him and toss him away. We [[Italian people|Italians]] are like that little cat: in that pot there is oil for everybody, but someone does not want to let us get close to it."{{cite this quote|date=October 2018}}

This kind of fable made Mattei extremely popular in the economically poor Italy of the time, and he gained the popular support that was needed to gain political support. To break the oligopoly of the '[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]' (a term he coined to refer to the dominant oil companies of the mid-20th century&lt;ref name = ft/&gt;), Mattei initiated agreements with the poorest countries of the [[Middle East]] and countries of the former [[Eastern Bloc|soviet bloc]] as well. Mattei visited Moscow in 1959, where he brokered an oil import deal with the Soviet Union in the middle of the [[Cold War]] over intense protests from NATO and the U.S. He also publicly supported independence movements against colonial powers, which allowed ENI to take advantage of postcolonial bitterness in places like Algeria.&lt;ref name=hayes/&gt; To opponents who charged that he was helping Communists and making Italy dependent on a capricious flow from the Soviet Union, Mattei answered that he bought from the cheapest sources.&lt;ref name=time021162/&gt;

Mattei forged agreements with [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]], to which he offered a 50-50 partnership for extracting their oil, very different from the sort of concessions normally offered by the major oil companies. To [[Iran]] and [[Egypt]] he additionally offered that the risk involved in prospecting was entirely ENI's: if there was no petrol, the countries would not have to pay one cent. In 1957, with ENI already competing with giants like [[Esso]] or [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], rumour has it that Mattei was secretly financing the independence movement against colonialist [[France]] in the [[Algerian War]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In 1960, after concluding the agreement with the Soviet Union and while negotiating with [[China]], Mattei publicly declared that the American [[monopoly]] was over. The reaction was initially mild, and he (ENI) was invited to take part in the partition of the prospecting map in the [[Sahara]]. However, Mattei made the independence of Algeria a condition of his acceptance. No agreement would be subscribed until that event. As a consequence of his stance, Mattei was considered to have become a target of the French far-right terrorist organization [[Organisation de l'armée secrète|OAS]], opposed to Algeria's independence, which began sending him explicit threats.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Death==
On October 27, 1962 on a flight from Catania (Sicily) to the Milan [[Linate Airport]], Mattei's jetplane, a [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]], crashed in the surroundings of the small village of [[Bascapè]] in [[Lombardy]]. The cause of the accident has been a mystery. There are strong indications that the crash was caused by a bomb hidden in the airplane.&lt;ref name=time021162/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19621027-0 Accident description], [[Aviation Safety Network]]&lt;/ref&gt; All three men on board were killed: Mattei, his pilot [[Irnerio Bertuzzi]], and the American [[Time–Life]] Journalist [[William McHale]]. The inquiries officially declared that it was an accident. The [[Italian Minister of Defense]], [[Giulio Andreotti]], was responsible for the accident investigation.

During his controversial tenure of ENI, Mattei had made many enemies. The [[U.S. National Security Council]] described him as an irritation and an obstacle in a classified report from 1958. The French could not forgive him for doing business with the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|pro-independence movement in Algeria]]. Responsibility for his death has been attributed to the [[CIA]], to the French extreme-nationalist group, the [[Organisation de l'armée secrète|OAS]], and to the [[Sicilian Mafia]].&lt;ref name=ind290897/&gt;

According to a 2001 TV documentary by [[Bernhard Pletschinger]] and [[Claus Bredenbrock]], evidence was immediately destroyed at the crash site. Flight instruments were put into acid. On October 25, 1995, the Italian public service broadcaster [[RAI]] reported the [[exhumation]] of the human remains of Mattei and Bertuzzi. Metal debris deformed by an explosion was found in the bones. There is speculation that the fuse of an [[improvised explosive device|explosive device]] was triggered by the mechanism of the landing gear. In 1994 the investigations were reopened and in 1997 a metal indicator and a ring were further analyzed by Professor Firrao of [[Politecnico di Torino]] and explosion tracks were found.&lt;ref name=bomb&gt;[http://www.gruppofrattura.it/ocs/index.php/cigf/igf20/paper/viewFile/781/698 Was there a bomb on Mattei’s aircraft?], by Donato Firrao &amp; Graziano Ubertalli, Convegno Nazionale IGF XX, Turin, June 24–26, 2009; {{ISBN|978-88-95940-25-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this evidence the episode was reclassified by the judge as homicide, but with perpetrator(s) unknown.

Not trusting the [[SISDE|Sifar]] (Italian secret service), even though it was full of his loyal supporters, Mattei constituted a sort of personal security guard made of former partisans, ENI staff by whom he felt protected.

'''Other facts on the crash:'''
* According to Phillipe Thyraud de Vosjoli, a former agent of the French secret service [[SDECE]], SDECE agents were responsible for the 1962 plane crash which took the life of Mattei. Mattei was on the verge of engineering an Italian takeover of French oil interests in Algeria. A French agent code-named Laurent tinkered with Mattei's aircraft.&lt;ref name=kruger&gt;[http://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg21693.html The Great Heroin Coup - Drugs, Intelligence &amp; International Fascism], [[Henrik Kruger]], Boston: [[South End Press]] 1980, {{ISBN|0-89608-031-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When preparing the film ''[[The Mattei Affair]]'' in 1970, [[Francesco Rosi]] asked the journalist [[Mauro De Mauro]] to investigate the last days of Mattei in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name=ind290897/&gt; De Mauro soon obtained an audio-tape of his last speech and spent days studying it. De Mauro disappeared eight days after his retrieval of the tape, on September 16, 1970, without leaving a trace. His body was never found.&lt;ref name=ind290897/&gt;&lt;ref name=ind190605&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/revealed-how-story-of-mafia-plot-to-launch-coup-cost-reporter-his-life-8016392.html Revealed: how story of Mafia plot to launch coup cost reporter his life], The Independent on Sunday, June 19, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; All the [[Carabinieri]] and [[Police]] investigators who searched for De Mauro, and consequently investigated his presumed kidnapping, were later killed. Among them the general [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] and [[Boris Giuliano]] were both killed by [[the Mafia]].
*[[Tommaso Buscetta]], an important [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] turncoat ([[pentito]]), declared that the Sicilian Mafia had been involved in the murder of Mattei. According to Buscetta, Mattei was killed at the request of the American Cosa Nostra because his policies had damaged important American interests in the Middle East. The journalist De Mauro was subsequently killed in 1970, because his investigation on Mattei's death was getting close to the truth.&lt;ref name=rep230594&gt;{{it icon}} [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/05/23/buscetta-cosa-nostra-uccise-enrico-mattei.html Buscetta: 'Cosa nostra uccise Enrico Mattei'], [[la Repubblica]], May 23, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaetano Iannì]], another pentito, declared that a special agreement had been achieved between the [[Cosa Nostra]] and "some foreigners" for the elimination of Mattei, which was organized by [[Giuseppe Di Cristina]].&lt;ref name=rep210694&gt;{{it icon}} [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/06/21/fu-di-cristina-sabotare-aereo.html 'Fu Di Cristina a sabotare l'aereo di Enrico Mattei'], La Repubblica, June 21, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; These statements triggered new inquiries, including the exhumation of Mattei's corpse.&lt;ref name=ind290897/&gt;
*Admiral [[Fulvio Martini]], later chief of [[SISMI]] (military secret service), declared that Mattei's plane had been shot down.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} In 1986, former Italian Prime Minister [[Amintore Fanfani]] described the accident as a shooting as well, perhaps the first act of [[terrorism in Italy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Legacy==
Enrico Mattei is a controversial figure in Italian 20th century history. Mattei made ENI a powerful company, so much so that Italians dub it "the state within the state."&lt;ref name=time210761/&gt; Some describe him as a sort of [[paladin]], a nationalist, while others point to his hunger for power, and his cold calculating nature.

Mattei coined the term "Seven Sisters" to refer to the dominant oil companies of the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/471ae1b8-d001-11db-94cb-000b5df10621.html The new Seven Sisters: oil and gas giants dwarf western rivals], Financial Times, March 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline]], a natural gas pipeline from Algeria via Tunisia to Sicily and thence to mainland Italy, was named after Enrico Mattei. ENI named a research institute after Mattei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.feem.it/getpage.aspx?id=34&amp;sez=About%20us&amp;padre=24&amp;lang= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816231043/http://www.feem.it/getpage.aspx?id=34&amp;sez=About%20us&amp;padre=24&amp;lang= | dead-url=yes | archive-date=August 16, 2011 | title=The Founder, Eni | publisher=Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei | accessdate=May 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei'' (FEEM) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution devoted to the study of sustainable development and global governance.

[[Image:Forearc.gif|thumb|275px]]
A '''forearc''' is the region between an [[oceanic trench]] and the associated [[volcanic arc]]. Forearc regions are found at [[convergent boundary|convergent margins]], and include any [[accretionary wedge]] and forearc basin that may be present. Due to tectonic stresses as one tectonic plate rides over another, forearc regions are sources for great thrust earthquakes &lt;ref name="Fuller et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fuller |first=C. W |last2=Willet |first2=S.D. |last3=Brandon |first3=M.T. |title = Formation of forearc basins and their influence on subduction zone earthquakes.

Keith |last3=Fredrick| first3=Vine J. |title=Global Tectonics|year=2009|publisher=J. Wiley|location=Signapore by Moarkono|isbn=978-1-4051-0777-8|edition=3rd|pages=1–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
During [[subduction]], an [[oceanic crust|oceanic]] plate is thrust below another tectonic plate, which may be oceanic or [[continental crust|continental]]. Water and other volatiles in the down-going plate cause [[flux melting]] in the upper mantle, creating magma that rises and penetrates the overriding plate, forming a [[volcanic arc]]. The weight of the down-going slab flexes the down-going plate creating an [[oceanic trench]]. The area between the trench and the arc is the forearc region, and the area behind the arc (i.e. on the side away from the trench) is the [[back-arc region]].

Initial theories proposed that the oceanic trenches and magmatic arcs were the primary suppliers of the accretionary sedimentation wedges in the forearc regions. More recent discovery suggests that some of the accreted material in the forearc region is from a mantle source along with trench turbidites derived from continental material. This theory holds due to evidence of pelagic sediments and continental crust being subducted in processes known as sediment subduction and subduction erosion respectively.&lt;ref name="Kearey et al. 2006"/&gt;

Over geological time there is constant recycling of the forearc deposits due to erosion, deformation and sedimentary subduction. The constant circulation of material in the forearc region (accretionary prism, forarc basin and trench) generates a mixture of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary sequences. In general, there is an increase in metamorphic grade from trench to arc where highest grade (blueschist to eclogite) is structurally uplifted (in the prisms) compared to the younger deposits (basins).  Forearc regions are also where ophiolites are emplaced should [[obduction]] occur, but such deposits are not continuous and can often be removed by erosion.&lt;ref name="Kearey et al. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caset and Dewey 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Casey|first=J. |last2=Dewey |first2=J. |title = Arc/Forearc Lengthening at Plate Triple junctions and the Formation of Ophiolitic Soles |journal = Geological Research Abstracts|year=2013 |volume=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As tectonic plates converge, the closing of an ocean will result in the convergence of two landmasses, each of which is either an [[island arc]] or continental margin. When these two bodies collide, the result is [[orogenesis]], at which time the underthrusting oceanic crust slows down.&lt;ref name="Kearey et al. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown and Spadea 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown|first=D. |last2=Spadea|first2=P |title = Processes of forearc and accretionary complex formation during arc-continent collision in the southern Ural Mountains |journal = Geology |pages= 649–652|year=2013 |volume=27 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1999)027&lt;0649:pofaac&gt;2.3.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early stages of [[arc-continent]] collision, there is uplift and erosion of the accretionary prism and forearc basin. In the later stages of collision, the forearc region may be sutured, rotated and shortened which can form syn-collisional folds and thrust belts.

==Structure==
The forearc region includes any forearc basin, outer-arc high, accretionary prism and the trench itself.&lt;ref name="Kearey et al. 2006"/&gt; The accretionary prism is located at the slope of the trench break where there is significantly decreased slope angle. Between the break and the magmatic arc, a sedimentary basin filled with erosive material from the volcanic arc and substrate can accumulate into a forearc basin which overlays the oldest thrust slices in the wedge of the forearc region.&lt;ref name="Kearey et al. 2006"/&gt;

In general, the forearc topography (specifically in the trench region) is trying to achieve an equilibrium between buoyancy and tectonic forces caused by subduction. Upward motion of the forearc is related to buoyancy forces and the downward motion is associated with the tectonic forcing which causes the oceanic lithosphere to descend.&lt;ref name="Kearey et al. 2006"/&gt; The relationship between surface slope and subduction thrust also plays a huge role in the variation of forearc structure and deformation.&lt;ref name="Fuller et al. 2006"/&gt; A subduction wedge can be classified as either stable with little deformation or unstable with pervasive internal deformation (see section on Models). Some common deformation in forearc sediments are [[Synsedimentary fold|synsedimentary deformation]] and [[olistostrome]]s, such as  that seen in the [[Magnitogorsk]] forearc region.&lt;ref name="Brown and Spadea 1999"/&gt;

==Models==
[[File:Types of Forearcs.jpg|thumb|Types of forearcs]]
There are two models which characterize a forearc basin formation and deformation and are dependent on sediment deposition and subsidence (see figure). The first model is associated with a forearc basin formed with little to no sediment supply. Conversely, the second model is associated with sediment supply. Topographic depressions which are accertionary and nonaccretionary in nature will depend on the supply of oceanic plate sediments, continentally derived clastic material and orthogonal convergence rates.&lt;ref name="Fuller et al. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kearey et al. 2006"/&gt; The accretionary flux (sediment supply in and out) also determines the rate at which the sedimentation wedges grow within the forearc.&lt;ref name="Fuller et al. 2006"/&gt;

The age of the oceanic crust along with the convergent velocity controls the coupling across the converging interface of the continental and oceanic crust. The strength of this coupling controls the deformation associated with the event and can be seen in the forearc region deformation signatures.&lt;ref name="Kearey et al. 2006"/&gt;

==Seismicity==

The intense interaction between the overriding and underthrusting plates in the forearc regions have shown to evolve strong coupling mechanisms which result in megathrust earthquakes such as the Tohoku-oki earthquake which occurred off the Pacific coast of Northeast Japan (Tian and Liu. 2013). These mega thrust earthquakes may be correlated with low values of heat flow generally associated with forearc regions. Geothermal data shows a heat flow of ~30–40&amp;nbsp;mW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which indicates cold, strong mantle.&lt;ref name="Tian and Liu 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tian|first=L. |last2=Liu |first2=Lucy |title = Geophysical properties and seismotectonics of the Tohoku forearc region.  |journal = Geological Survey of Japan |pages=235–244 |year=2013 |volume=64 |doi=10.1016/j.jseaes.2012.12.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One good example is the Mariana forearc, where scientists have done extensive research. In this setting there is an erosive margin and forearc slope which consists of 2&amp;nbsp;km high and 30&amp;nbsp;km diameter serpentine- mud volcanoes. The erosive properties of these volcanoes are consistent with the metamorphic grades (blueschists) expected for this region in the forearc. There is evidence from geothermal data and models which show the slab-mantle interface, levels of friction and the cool oceanic lithosphere at the trench.&lt;ref name="Kearey et al. 2006"/&gt; Other good examples are:
* Central Andean Forearc
* Banda Forearc 
* Savu-Wetar Forearc 
* Luzon arc-forearc 
* Tohoku Forearc
* Between [[Cordillera Occidental (Bolivia)|Western Cordillera]] and Peru-Chile Trench

The '''geostationary ring''' is a volume segment around the [[geostationary orbit]] defined by variations in altitude and declination that can occur for uncontrolled objects left in the [[geostationary orbit]].

The [[geostationary orbit]] is subject to [[orbit perturbations]] caused by anomalies in the [[gravitational field]] of the [[Earth]], by the gravitational effects of [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], and by [[solar radiation]] pressure.

A precessional motion of the [[orbit plane]] is caused by the oblatedness of the [[Earth]] (&lt;math&gt;J_2&lt;/math&gt;), and the gravitational effects of [[Sun]] and [[Moon]]. This motion has a period of about 53 years. The two parameters describing the direction of the [[orbit plane]] in space, the [[right ascension]] of the ascending node, and the [[inclination]] are affected by this [[precession]]. The maximum [[inclination]] reached during the 53-year cycle is about 15 degrees. Therefore, the definition of the geostationary ring foresees a declination range from -15 degrees to +15 degrees.

On the other hand, [[solar radiation]] pressure induces an [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] that leads to a variation of the orbit radius by ± 75 kilometers in some cases.

This leads to the definition of the geostationary ring as being a segment of space around the [[geostationary orbit]] that ranges from 75 km below GEO to 75 km above GEO and from -15 degrees to 15 degrees declination.

In [[structural geology]], a '''homocline''' or '''homoclinal structure''' (from old {{lang-el|homo}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;same, cline&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;inclination), is a geological structure in which the layers of a sequence of rock [[strata]], either [[sedimentary]] or [[igneous]], [[Strike and dip|dip]] uniformly in a single direction having the same general inclination in terms of direction and angle.&lt;ref name="Jackson2005a"&gt;Jackson, JA, J Mehl and K Neuendorf (2005) ''Glossary of Geology.''

When the homoclinal strata consists of alternating layers of rock that vary hardness and resistance to [[erosion]], their erosion produces either [[cuesta]]s, [[homoclinal ridge]]s, or [[Hogback (geology)|hogback]]s depending on the angle of dip of the strata.&lt;ref name="Thornbury1954a"&gt;Thornbury, W.

'''Unicline''' and '''Uniclinal'''  are obsolete and currently uncommon terms that are defined and have been used by [[geologist]]s and [[geomorphologist]]s in an inconsistent and contradictory manner. They are terms that have been used in a mutually exclusive manner as a synonym for either a homocline&lt;ref name="ThomasOthers2000a"&gt;Thomas, G, and A Goudie (2000) The Dictionary of Physical Geography, 3rd ed. Blackwell Publishing Ltd., Maiden, Massachusetts. 624 pp. {{ISBN|978-0631204732}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[monocline]]&lt;ref name="U.S.BureauofMines1996a"&gt;U.S. Bureau of Mines Staff (1996) ''Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, &amp; Related Terms.''

The meaning of this term has been further confused by Grabau, who redefined ''uniclinal,'' not as a geological structure, but as a general term for ridges produced by erosion of [[anticline]]s.&lt;ref name="Grabau1920a"&gt;Grabau, AW (1920a) ''Unicline; a term proposed for monoclinal ridges of erosion.''

Heath &amp; Company, New York, New York. 804 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The erosion of tilted sequences of either stratified sedimentary or igneous rock, homoclines, of alternating resistance to erosion produce distinctive landforms that form a gradational continuum from cuestas through homoclinal ridges to hogbacks. Less resistant beds are preferentially eroded creating valleys that lie between ridges created by the erosion of more resistant beds. For example, the erosion of homoclines consisting of resistant beds of either limestone, sandstone, or both interbedded with weaker, less resistant beds of either shale, siltstone, marl, or combination of them will produce either cuestas, homoclinal ridges, or hogbacks depending on the angle of dip of the strata.  The greater the difference in the resistance to erosion, the more pronounced the structural control and relief between valley and ridge crest.&lt;ref name="Thornbury1954a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Twidale1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerrand1993a"/&gt;

==Etymology==
According to Whitney in 1890&lt;ref name="Whitney1914a"&gt;Whitney, WD (1890) ''The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia: An Encyclopedia Lexicon of the English Language.'' vol. VI, The Century Company, New York, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kelley in 1955,&lt;ref name="Kelley1955a"&gt;Kelley VC (1955) [http://cgsdocs.state.co.us/Docs/ERC/MONOCLINES%20OF%20THE%20COLORADO%20PLATEAU-KELLEY%201955a.pdf ''Monoclines of the Colorado Plateau.''] Geological Society of America Bulletin. 66(7):789-804.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] used the term ''uniclinal'' prior to 1843 to describe to strata dipping uniformly in one direction. Later in 1843, Rogers and Rogers&lt;ref name="RogersOthers1843a"&gt;Rogers, WB, and HD Rogers (1843) ''On the physical structure of the Appalachian chain, as exemplifying the laws which regulated the elevation of great mountain chains generally.'' Association of Geographers and Naturalists. 1:474-531.&lt;/ref&gt; created the term ''monocline'' and used it to describe beds dipping uniformly in one direction within the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. However, starting with Powell in 1873,&lt;ref name="Powell1873a"&gt;Powell, JW (1873) ''Geological structure of a Grand Canyon of the Colorado.'' American Journal of Science 3rd series, 5(5):456-465.&lt;/ref&gt; geologists also used ''monocline'' to specifically described a step-like fold in otherwise uniformly dipping strata while other geologists still used it to describe beds dipping uniformly in one direction.&lt;ref name="Kelley1955a"/&gt; Thus, the term ''monocline'' was used to describe both beds dipping in one direction and a one-limbed flexure with different authors making incompatible distinctions between them. Because of this confused usage of ''monocline'', Daly&lt;ref name="Daly1915a"&gt;Daly, RA (1915) ''A Geological Reconnaissance between Golden and Kamloops, B.C., along the Canadian Pacific Railway.'' memoir no. 68. Canada Geological Survey, Canada department of Mines, Ottawa, Canada. 260 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daly1916a"&gt;Daly, RA (1916) ''Homocline and Monocline.'' Geological Society of America Bulletin 27:89-92.&lt;/ref&gt; formally introduced the term ''homocline'' and in 1915 and 1916 defined it in its current usage and redefined ''monocline'' as a one-limbed flexure as it is currently used.&lt;ref name="Kelley1955a"/&gt;

[[File:Cretaceous seaway.png|thumb|Hudson Seaway]]
The '''Hudson Seaway''' was a major seaway of [[North America]] during the [[Cretaceous Period]] some 75 million years ago. It is named after the [[Hudson Bay]], which currently occupies much of its extent.  Although not as extensive as the [[Western Interior Seaway]], which divided North America into eastern and western landmasses ([[Appalachia (Mesozoic)|Appalachia]] and [[Laramidia]], respectively), the Hudson Seaway had major impacts on climate and migration routes by dividing the eastern half of the continent into two (Appalachia and Franklinia). [[Greenland]] was more permanently separated, by the foundered rift that created the [[Labrador Seaway]].

'''Ipas''' is a global [[non-profit organization]] that works to increase women's ability to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights, and to end deaths and injuries from unsafe [[abortion]]. Ipas's work is grounded in the belief that women everywhere must have the opportunity to determine their futures, care for their families and manage their fertility. Through local, national and global partnerships, they work to ensure that women receive safe, respectful and comprehensive abortion care, including counselling and contraception, to prevent future unwanted pregnancies.

==Scope of work==
Ipas works to improve women's access and right to safe [[abortion]] care and [[reproductive health]] services by:

* Training doctors, nurses, and midwives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=20638991|year=2010|author1=Akiode|first1=A|title=An evaluation of a national intervention to improve the postabortion care content of midwifery education in Nigeria|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|volume=110|issue=2|pages=186–90|last2=Fetters|first2=T|last3=Daroda|first3=R|last4=Okeke|first4=B|last5=Oji|first5=E|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2010.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in clinical and counseling skills for abortion, postabortion care and [[family planning]];

=== Abortion in Nigeria ===
In 2017, Ipas (Nigeria), called for a review of Nigeria's law criminalising abortion in the country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/ipas-calls-review-law-abortion/|title=Vanguard Article on Nigeria's Abortion Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a workshop covering Woman’s Reproductive Health and Rights in Abuja, Nigeria, Ipas's Country Director spoke out about the issue, saying "Any law that does not recognise or reflect the true situation of the country is a dead law."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; foegal  

==History==
Ipas was founded in 1973, following the passage of the Helms Amendment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/restrictions.html USAID | USAID's Family Planning Guiding Principles and U.S. Legislative and Policy Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibits use of U.S. foreign aid to support abortion services overseas.

'''Johannes Stöffler''' (also ''Stöfler, Stoffler, Stoeffler''; 10 December 1452 – 16 February 1531) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]], [[astrologer]], [[priest]], maker of astronomical instruments and [[professor]] at the [[University of Tübingen]].

==Life==
Johannes Stöffler was born on 10 December 1452, in [[Justingen]] near [[Blaubeuren]] on the [[Swabian Alb]]. Having received his basic education at the Blaubeuren monastery school, he registered at the newly founded [[University of Ingolstadt]] on 21 April 1472, where he was consequently promoted [[Bachelor's degree|Baccalaureus]] in September 1473 and [[Magister (degree)|Magister]] in January 1476. After finishing his studies he obtained the parish of Justingen where he, besides his clerical obligations, concerned himself with [[astronomy]], [[astrology]] and the making of [[astronomical instruments]], [[Astronomical clock|clocks]] and celestial [[globe]]s. He conducted a lively correspondence with leading [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] - for example, [[Johannes Reuchlin]], for whom he made an Equatorium and wrote [[horoscope]]s.

In 1499 he predicted that a [[Deluge myth|deluge]] would cover the world on 20 February 1524.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Ten Notable Apocalypses That (Obviously) Didn’t Happen  |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Ten-Notable-Apocalypses-That-Obviously-Didnt-Happen.html |quote=In 1499, the German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Stöffler predicted that a vast flood would engulf the world on 20 February 1524. (His calculations foretold 20 planetary conjunctions during this year—16 of which would take place in a “watery sign,” a.k.a. Pisces.)|work=[[Smithsonian magazine]] |date=November 12, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1507, at the instigation of Duke [[Herzog Ulrich von Württemberg|Ulrich I]] he received the newly established chair of [[mathematics]] and astronomy at the [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen|University of Tübingen]], where he excelled in rich teaching and publication activities and finally was elected [[Rector (academia)|rector]] in 1522. By the time of his appointment he already enjoyed a virtual monopoly in [[ephemeris]]-making in collaboration with [[Jacob Pflaum]], continuing the calculations of [[Regiomontanus]] through 1531, and then through 1551, the latter being published posthumously in 1531.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gingerich |first=Owen |date=1975 |title="Crisis" versus Aesthetic in the Copernican Revolution |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4258973/Crisis%20vs%20Aesthetic%20OGingrich.pdf |journal=Vistas in Astronomy |publisher=Elsevier BV |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=85–95 |access-date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writing ''Elucidatio fabricae ususque astrolabii'', published in several editions, served astronomers and surveyors for a long time as a standard work.&lt;ref&gt;Kern, Ralf, ''Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit''. Vol. 1: ''Vom Astrolab zum mathematischen Besteck''. Cologne, 2010. p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philipp Melanchthon]] and [[Sebastian Münster]] rank among his most famous students. When a [[bubonic plague|plague]] epidemic forced the division and relocation of his university to the surrounding countryside in 1530, Stöffler went to [[Blaubeuren]] and died there on 16 February 1531 of the plague. He was buried in the choir of the collegiate church (Stiftskirche) in [[Tübingen]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3676">[[File:Природа Калмыкии.JPG|thumb|Kalmyk Steppe]]
'''Kalmuk Steppe''', or '''Kalmyk Steppe''' is a [[steppe]] of approximately 100,000&amp;nbsp;km², bordering the northwest [[Caspian Sea]], bounded by the [[Volga]] on the N.E., the Manych on the S.W. and the territory of the [[Don Cossacks]] on the N.W. The historic home to the Kalmuck or Kalmyk [[Kalmyk people|Tatars]], it is in the [[Federal subjects of Russia|Federal subject]] of [[Astrakhan Oblast]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Kalmuck |volume=15 |page=643 |first1=Peter |last1=Kropotkin |first2=John Thomas |last2=Bealby|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The western Kalmuck Steppe occupied by the Ergeni hills, is deeply trenched by ravines and rises 300 and occasionally 630&amp;nbsp;ft. above the sea. It is built up of Tertiary deposits, belonging to the [[Sarmatian]] division of the [[Miocene]] period and covered with bess and black earth, and its escarpments represent the old shore-line of the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]]. No Caspian deposits are found on or within the Ergeni hills. These hills exhibit the usual black earth flora, and they have a settled population.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The eastern part of the steppe is a plain, lying for the most part 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;ft. below the level of the sea and sloping gently towards the Volga. Post-Pliocene Aral-Caspian deposits, containing the usual fossils (''Hydrobia'', ''Neritina'', eight species of ''Cardium'', two of ''Dreissena'', three of ''Adacna'' and ''Lithoglyphus caspius''), attain thicknesses varying from 105&amp;nbsp;ft. to 7 or 10&amp;nbsp;ft., and disappear in places. Lacustrine and fluviatile deposits occur intermingled with the above. Large areas of moving sands exist near Enotayevsk, where high dunes or barkhans have been formed.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A narrow tract of land along the coast of the Caspian, known as the “hillocks of Baer,” is covered with hillocks elongated from west to east, perpendicularly to the coast-line, the spaces between them being filled with water or overgrown with thickets of reed, ''Salix'', ''Ulmus campestris'', almond trees, &amp;c. An archipelago of little islands is thus formed close to the shore by these mounds, which are backed on the N. and N.W. by strings of salt lakes, partly desiccated. Small streams originate in the Ergenis, but are lost as soon as they reach the lowlands, where water can only be obtained from wells. The scanty vegetation is a mixture of the flora of south-east Russia and that of the deserts of central Asia.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

As of 1911, the steppe had an estimated population of 130,000 persons, living in over 27,700 kibitkas, or felt tents. There were many [[Buddhist]] [[monastery|monasteries]]. Part of the Kalmucks were settled (chiefly in the hilly parts), the remainder being nomads.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[Antony Beevor]], in his 1998 book ''[[Stalingrad (book)|Stalingrad]]'', said that "Russians from the north thought of [Kalmyk Steppe] as 'the end of the world'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beevor|first1=Antony|title=Stalingrad|date=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-024985-0|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 the people were forcibly deported (see [[Kalmykia]]).

The '''Labrador Sea''' ([[French language|French]]: ''mer du Labrador'', [[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Labradorhavet'') is an arm of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] between the [[Labrador Peninsula]] and [[Greenland]]. The sea is flanked by [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] to the southwest, northwest, and northeast. It connects to the north with [[Baffin Bay]] through the [[Davis Strait]].&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046724/Labrador-Sea|title=Labrador Sea|author=Encyclopædia Britannica|authorlink=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a [[marginal sea]] of the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="Calow1999"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Calow|title=Blackwell's concise encyclopedia of environmental management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0E0LP-pPCWwC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=29 November 2010|date=12 July 1999|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-0-632-04951-6|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spall, Michael A. |title=Boundary Currents and Watermass Transformation in Marginal Seas |doi=10.1175/1520-0485(2004)034&lt;1197:BCAWTI&gt;2.0.CO;2 |journal=J.

The sea formed upon separation of the [[North American Plate]] and [[Greenland Plate]] that started about 60 million years ago and stopped about 40 million years ago. It contains one of the world's largest [[turbidity current]] channel systems, the [[Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Channel]] (NAMOC), that runs for thousands of kilometers along the sea bottom toward the Atlantic Ocean.

The Labrador Sea is a major source of the [[North Atlantic Deep Water]], a cold water mass that flows at great depth along the western edge of the North Atlantic, spreading out to form the largest identifiable water mass in the [[World Ocean]].

==History==
The Labrador Sea formed upon separation of the [[North American Plate]] and [[Greenland Plate]] that started about 60 million years ago ([[Paleocene]]) and stopped about 40 million years ago.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; A [[sedimentary basin]], which is now buried under the continental shelves, formed during the [[Cretaceous]].&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Onset of magmatic [[sea-floor spreading]] was accompanied by volcanic eruptions of [[picrite]]s and [[basalt]]s in the [[Paleocene]] at the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Between about 500 BC and 1300 AD, the southern coast of the sea contained [[Dorset culture|Dorset]], [[Beothuk]] and [[Inuit]] settlements; Dorset tribes were later replaced by [[Thule people|Thule]] people.&lt;ref&gt;''Grønlands forhistorie'', ed. Hans Christian Gulløv, Gyldendal 2005, {{ISBN|87-02-01724-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent==
{{GeoGroupTemplate}}
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Labrador Sea as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the North: the South limit of [[Davis Strait]] [The parallel of [[60th parallel north|60° North]] between [[Greenland]] and [[Labrador]]].

On the East: a line from Cape St. Francis {{coord|47|45|N|52|27|W|type:waterbody_scale:10000000_region:CA-NL|name=Cape St. Francis}} ([[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]) to [[Cape Farewell, Greenland|Cape Farewell]] (Greenland).

On the West: the East Coast of Labrador and Newfoundland and the Northeast limit of the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence|Gulf of St. Lawrence]] – a line running from [[Cape Bauld]] (North point of [[Quirpon Island|Kirpon Island]], {{coord|51|40|N|55|25|W|type:waterbody_scale:10000000_region:CA-NL|name=Cape Bauld}}) to the East extreme of [[Belle Isle (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Belle Isle]] and on to the Northeast Ledge ({{coord|52|02|N|55|15|W|type:waterbody_scale:10000000_region:CA-NL|name=Belle Isle}}). Thence a line joining this ledge with the East extreme of [[Cape St. Charles]] (52°13'N) in Labrador.

The water temperature varies between {{Convert|-1|C}} in winter and {{Convert|5|-|6|C|F}} in summer. The salinity is relatively low, at 31–34.9 parts per thousand. Two-thirds of the sea is covered in ice in winter. Tides are [[Earth tide|semi-diurnal]] (i.e. occur twice a day), reaching {{Convert|4|m|fathom ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

There is an anticlockwise water circulation in the sea. It is initiated by the [[East Greenland Current]] and continued by the [[West Greenland Current]], which brings warmer, more saline waters northwards, along the Greenland coasts up to the Baffin Bay. Then, the [[Baffin Island Current]] and [[Labrador Current]] transport cold and less saline water southward along the Canadian coast. These currents carry numerous icebergs and therefore hinder navigation and exploration of the gas fields beneath the sea bed.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref name=can&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/labrador-sea/|title=Labrador Sea|author= Kenneth F.

The sea provides a significant part of the [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] (NADW) – a cold water mass that flows at great depth along the western edge of the North Atlantic, spreading out to form the largest identifiable water mass in the [[World Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMI6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA179|page=179|title=Earth systems: processes and issues|author=Wallace Gary Ernst|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2000|isbn=0-521-47895-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NADW consists of three parts of different origin and salinity, and the top one, the Labrador Sea Water (LSW), is formed in the Labrador Sea. This part occurs at a medium depth and has a relatively low salinity (34.84–34.89 parts per thousand), low temperature ({{Convert|3.3|-|3.4|C|F|1}}) and high oxygen content compared to the layers above and below it. LSW also has a relatively low vorticity, i.e. the tendency to form vortices, than any other water in North Atlantic that reflects its high homogeneity. It has a [[potential density]] of 27.76–27.78&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; relatively to the surface layers, meaning it is denser, and thus sinks under the surface and remains homogeneous and unaffected by the surface fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Talley|first1=L.D.|last2=McCartney|first2=M.S.|title=Distribution and Circulation of Labrador Sea Water|doi=10.1175/1520-0485(1982)012&lt;1189:DACOLS&gt;2.0.CO;2|issn=1520-0485|year=1982|page=1189|volume=12|journal=Journal of Physical Oceanography|url=ftp://gyre.ucsd.edu/nonpub/talley/papers/1980s/talley_mccartney_jpo_1982.pdf|issue=11}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
The northern and western parts of the Labrador Sea are covered in ice between December and June. The [[drift ice]] serves as a breeding ground for seals in early spring. The sea is also a feeding ground for [[Atlantic salmon]] and several marine mammal species. [[shrimp fishery|Shrimp fisheries]] began in 1978 and intensified toward 2000, as well as cod fishing. However, the cod fishing rapidly depleted the fish population in the 1990s near the Labrador and West Greenland banks and was therefore halted in 1992.&lt;ref name=can/&gt; Other fishery targets include [[haddock]], [[Atlantic herring]], [[lobster]] and several species of [[flatfish]] and [[pelagic fish]] such as [[sand lance]] and [[capelin]]. They are most abundant in the southern parts of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=6–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTcrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6|title=Maritime services to support polar resource development|author=National Research Council (U.S.)|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beluga whales]], while abundant to the north, in the [[Baffin Bay]], where their population reaches 20,000, are rare in the Labrador Sea, especially since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/CW69-14-170-2004E.pdf COSEWIC Assessment and Update Status Report on the Beluga Whale].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33532">This is a list of [[Extrasolar planet|exoplanet]] discoveries that were the first by several criteria, including:

* the [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets|detection method]] used,
* the [[Extrasolar planet#Classifications|planet type]],
* the [[planetary system]] type,
* the [[Stellar classification|star type]],
and others.

==The first==
The choice of "first" depends on definition and confirmation, as below. The three systems detected prior to 1994 each have a drawback, with
Gamma Cephei b being unconfirmed until 2002; HD 114762 b is near the boundary of exoplanet / brown dwarf mass; while the 
PSR B1257+12 planets orbit a pulsar. This leaves 51 Peg b (discovered and confirmed 1995) as the first confirmed exoplanet around a normal star.

This page contains a table listing by [[elevation]] all 514 [[mountains]] of the [[Alps]] that are between 2500 and 3000m m high and have a [[topographic prominence]] of at least {{convert|300|m|ft|0}}. The list is a continuation of the [[List of mountains of the Alps above 3000 m]], which page contains an introduction with statistics and an explanation of the criteria. The list is continued down to 2000 m elevation on [[List of mountains of the Alps (2000–2499 m)|this page]].

!Rank&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Unranked summits have a topographic prominence between 293 and 299 m. They are included given the uncertainties in estimating these values.&lt;/ref&gt;
!Mountain 
!Height&lt;br/&gt;(m)&lt;ref&gt;All mountain heights and prominences are from the following maps:&lt;br/&gt;For France the 1:25,000 [http://www.geoportail.gouv.fr/accueil cartes topographiques] of the  [[Institut Géographique National]].&lt;br/&gt;For Switzerland the 1:25,000 [http://map.geo.admin.ch/ Swisstopo] maps.&lt;br/&gt;For Austria [[Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen|BEV]]'s [http://www.austrianmap.at Österreichische Karte 1:50.000] supplemented with the 1:25,000 [[Alpine Club map]]s where available.&lt;br/&gt;For Italy the 1:25,000 [[Istituto Geografico Militare]] maps via the [http://www.pcn.minambiente.it/viewer/  Geoportale Nazionale] website.&lt;br/&gt;For Slovenia the highest scale maps available via the [http://www.geopedia.si Geopedia.si] site.&lt;br/&gt;Key cols were verified using the [[SRTM]] data based contour lines in the terrain view of [[Google maps]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
![[Topographic prominence|Drop]] (m)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Numbers in italics are estimates when a precise height for the key col is lacking. For example, maps often provide heights for the place where a route passes over a ridge rather than for the lowest point in the ridge.&lt;/ref&gt;
!Coordinates&lt;ref&gt;Verified and fine-tuned via [https://maps.google.com/maps google terrain and satellite maps].&lt;/ref&gt;
!Range &lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For the Eastern Alps the range names are according to the [[Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps]].&lt;/ref&gt;
!Range&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;[[SOIUSA]] codes, representing a proposal for a new classification system of the Alps. The codes usually but not always correspond to established ranges. Sorting on this tab puts the mountains in a geographic order, roughly from the southwest to the east.&lt;/ref&gt;

!First&lt;ref&gt;The three main sources for first ascent data are:&lt;br/&gt;For France and in general; [[W.A.B. Coolidge]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=df4OAAAAQAAJ The Alps in nature and history], Methuen &amp; Co, London, 1908.&lt;br/&gt;For Switzerland; [[Gottlieb Studer]], ''Über Eis und Schnee: Die höchsten Gipfel der Schweiz und die Geschichte ihrer Besteigung,'' Volumes 1-3, Schmid &amp; Francke, Bern, 1896-1899.&lt;br/&gt;For the Eastern Alps: ''Die Erschließung der Ostalpen'', Volumes 1-3, German and Austrian Alpine Club, Berlin, 1894.&lt;br/&gt;These are the years for the first recorded ascents. In many cases local people or surveyors made earlier ascents. In particular, chamois and ibex hunters are expected to have reached many summits. Years in italics indicate that it is known that an earlier ascent was made, for example by the presence of artifacts on top or the summit's prior use as a triangulation point.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ascent

The '''Main Uralian Fault''' (MUF) runs north&amp;ndash;south through the middle of the [[Ural Mountains]] for over 2,000&amp;nbsp;km.  It separates both Europe from Asia and the three, or four, western megazones of the Urals from the three eastern megazones: namely the Pre-Uralian [[foreland basin|Foredeep]], West Uralian, and the Central Uralian to the west, and the Tagil-Magnitogorskian, East Uralian, and Transuralian to the east.  The [[Russian Plate]] is often included as the fourth megazone to the west. On the west side of the fault the rocks represent the sediments of the eastern continental margin zone of the European Plate ([[Baltica]]). On the east the rocks are [[Accretion (geology)|accreted]] oceanic and [[island arc]] [[basalt]]s, [[Ultramafic rock|ultramafics]] and volcanics as well as the sediments of the western continental margin zones of the Siberian craton ([[Angara Plate]]) on the north and the [[Kazakhstania|Kazakhstan craton]] on the south.

==Formation==
The Main Uralian Fault formed in the [[Riphean (stage)|Riphean]] (early [[Neoproterozoic]]) in the breakup of the supercontinent [[Rodinia]]  as a [[rift valley]] between the Baltica and the [[Angara Plate]] (Siberian craton). As these two plates pulled apart eventually a [[mid-ocean ridge]] formed. The ridge was of basic (basalt) and ultramafic material. Some 500 million years later, in the [[Silurian]], a [[subduction zone]] formed on the western margin of the Angara Plate, which at the time was on the western edge of [[Gondwana]], and the oceanic plate was subducted underneath the Angara Plate, accreting some of the basalts and ultramafics onto the Angara Plate. [[Sial]]ic sediments were metamorphosed, melted and intruded into the rocks above as [[granite]]s.  By the early [[Carboniferous]] the oceanic plates were completed subducted and the eastern margin of Baltica, then on the eastern edge of [[Laurussia]] began to collide with the western edge of Angara. In the south the western edge of [[Kazakhstania]] may have been pushed under Baltica. This collision in known generally as the [[Variscan orogeny]], and specifically as to the Urals as the [[Uralian orogeny]] The collision lasted nearly 90 million years from the Carboniferous to the early [[Triassic]].&lt;ref name="brown&amp;echtler"&gt;D.

==Dip==
There is [[seismic]] evidence that the Main Uralian Fault extends very deep, in excess of 15&amp;nbsp;km, into the crust and [[Strike and dip|dips]] to the east as a result of the subduction zone that formed in the [[Silurian]] along the western margin of the Siberian craton. This is supported by evidence of a north-south magmatic axis in the southern Urals that runs through the East Uralian megazone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Fershtater, G.B., Montero, P., Borodina, N.S., Pushkarev, E.V., Smirnov, V.N., and Bea, F. |year=1997|title=Uralian magmatism: an overview|journal=Tectonophysics|volume=276|pages=87&amp;ndash;102|doi=10.1016/S0040-1951(97)00049-8|bibcode = 1997Tectp.276...87F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maria Cacao''' is the ''[[diwata]]'' or mountain goddess (the exact term is derived from [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[devata]]'' देवता) associated with [[Mount Lantoy]] in [[Argao, Cebu]], [[Philippines]].  The Maria Cacao legend is a prominent example of the mountain-goddesses motiff in Philippine mythology, other prominent examples being [[Maria Makiling]] of [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]] and [[Maria Sinukuan]] of [[Mount Arayat]].

== Origin ==
The original name of the Maria Cacao is unknown as it was not recorded before the Spanish subjugated her name in a bid to instill Roman Catholicisms into the natives. But it is widely assumed her name is not indigenous as 'Cacao' is an imported term that came from Latin America when the Spanish arrived. Additionally, the term 'Maria' was added by the Spanish to turn her into 'Catholic', in a bid to widen Spanish rule in southern Cebu. Like in Makiling and Sinukuan, it is assumed that Maria Cacao's mythology was present prior to Spanish arrival, with minor differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rene O. Villanueva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==
The basic form of the Maria Cacao legend is that whenever rains flood the river that comes from Mount Lantoy, or a bridge is broken, this is a sign that Maria Cacao and her husband ''Mangao'' have either traveled down the river in their golden ship so that they can export their crops, or traveled up the river on their way back.&lt;ref name="lucero"&gt;[http://todd.lucero.sales.tripod.com/id47.html Argao: A Portrait of a Town&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717103544/http://todd.lucero.sales.tripod.com/id47.html |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is supposed to live inside a cave in the mountain and the Cacao plants outside it are supposed to be her plantation.&lt;ref name="villanueva"&gt;Maria Cacao: Ang Diwata ng Cebu (Maria Cacao: The Fairy of Cebu) Rene O. Villanueva&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary variants of the Maria Cacao legend===
One contemporary evolution of the legend is its merger with another common Filipino mythological motif – that of soul-harvesting boats.  The new stories suggest that borrowers who fail to pay their loans to the goddess would soon find themselves facing dire consequences, as Maria Cacao's boat comes to take their souls to the next world.&lt;ref name="Tan20160415"&gt;Michael Tan. Maria Cacao. 15 April 2016. http://opinion.inquirer.net/94297/maria-cacao accessed 15 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A very specific variant of this new element of the myth was reported in Cagayan de Oro in the aftermath of [[Typhoon Sendong]] (Tropical Storm Washi), when there were reported sightings of a boat with a woman at the helm traveling along the river and offering to pick up passengers.  These rumors were accompanied by a warning not to accept invitations to board the boat, because the woman was supposedly Maria Cacao "collecting souls for the next world."  In his regular newspaper column, anthropologist [[Michael Tan]] noted that this "soul harvester" function wasn't part of the prototypical myth, and associated the evolution of the myth with the social need to invent stories as a means of coping with disaster, creating a context for the sense of despair and, to some degree, offering a scapegoat for the situation.&lt;ref name="Tan20160415"/&gt;

== Interpretations and cultural significance ==
While the story is obviously mythical in nature, it is cited as evidence of how long the production of ''tableya'', has been going on in the area.&lt;ref name="lucero"/&gt; ''Tableya'' is [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] for round, unsweetened [[chocolate]] tablets made from [[cacao bean]]s. It is a crucial ingredient in the Filipino delicacies ''sikwate'' (hot chocolate) and [[champorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =How Tableya is made in Argao, Cebu | url =http://www.cebudaily.com/how-tableya-is-made-in-argao-cebu/ | accessdate =2008-07-17 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090801092702/http://www.cebudaily.com/how-tableya-is-made-in-argao-cebu/ | archivedate =2009-08-01 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:4953 DYK.svg|right|thumb|230px|The orbit of [[(4953) 1990 MU]], which, with a MOID of 0.0263 AU, is classified as a potentially hazardous object]]
'''Minimum orbit intersection distance''' ('''MOID''') is a measure used in [[astronomy]] to assess potential close approaches and collision risks between astronomical objects.&lt;ref name=Koehn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf1-3.html Basics of Space Flight: The Solar System, p3], NASA JPL, retrieved 14 May 2009, [https://www.webcitation.org/6a2NV0qx1?url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf1-3.php archived] 15 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is defined as the distance between the closest points of the [[osculating orbit]]s of two bodies.  Of greatest interest is the risk of a collision with [[Earth]].  Earth MOID is often listed on [[comet]] and [[asteroid]] databases such as the [[JPL Small-Body Database]].  MOID values are also defined with respect to other bodies as well: [[Jupiter]] MOID, [[Venus]] MOID and so on.

An object is classified as a [[potentially hazardous object]] (PHO) – that is, posing a possible risk to Earth – if, among other conditions, its Earth MOID is less than 0.05 [[Astronomical unit|AU]].  For more massive bodies than Earth, there is a potentially notable close approach with a larger MOID; for instance, Jupiter MOIDs less than 1 AU are considered noteworthy since Jupiter is the most massive planet.&lt;ref name=Koehn&gt;Bruce Koehn, "[http://www.lowell.edu/users/elgb/moid.html Minimum Orbital Intersection Distance]", Lowell Observatory, retrieved online 14 May 2009, [https://www.webcitation.org/6a2NQ2ufY?url=http://www2.lowell.edu/users/elgb/moid.html archived] 15 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A low MOID does not mean that a collision is inevitable as the planets frequently perturb the orbit of small bodies. It is also necessary that the two bodies reach that point in their orbits at the same time before the smaller body is perturbed into a different orbit with a different MOID value. Two Objects gravitationally locked in [[orbital resonance]] may never approach one another. [[Numerical integration]]s become increasingly divergent as trajectories are projected further forward in time, especially beyond times where the smaller body is repeatedly perturbed by other planets.  MOID has the convenience that it is obtained directly from the [[orbital elements]] of the body and no numerical integration into the future is used.&lt;ref&gt;Brian G. Marsden, [http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/pressinfo/100PHAs.html "Press Information Sheet:Potentially Hazardous Asteroids"], Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, retrieved online 3 May 2009, [https://www.webcitation.org/6a2NbJ1lJ?url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/pressinfo/100PHAs.html archived] 15 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only object that has ever been rated at 4 on the [[Torino Scale]] (since downgraded), the [[Aten asteroid]] [[(99942) Apophis]], has an Earth MOID of 0.000316 AU.  This is not the smallest Earth MOID in the catalogues; many bodies with a small Earth MOID are not classed as PHO's because the objects are less than roughly 140 meters in diameter (or [[absolute magnitude]], ''H'' &lt; 22). Earth MOID values are generally more practical for asteroids less than 140 meters in diameter as those asteroids are very dim and often have a short [[observation arc]] with a poorly determined orbit. The only objects that have been detected and had their Earth-MOID calculated before Earth impact were the small asteroids {{mpl|2008 TC|3}} and [[2014 AA]]. {{mp|2008 TC|3}} was listed with a MOID of 0.00001 AU in the [[Minor Planet Center]] database, and is the smallest MOID calculated for an [[Apollo asteroid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/Apollos.html List Of Apollo Minor Planets], International Astronomical Union: Minor Planet Center, retrieved 14 May 2009, [https://www.webcitation.org/6a2NgTikp?url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/Apollos.html archived] 15 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It is even smaller at the more precise [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]] Small Body Database (0.0000078 AU).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2008TC3 2008 TC3] at JPL Small Body Database.

[[Image:Glaciar moulin.svg|thumb|right|Schematic drawing of glacial features illustrating how moulins transport surface water to the base of the glacier]]
[[Image:Athabasca.Moulin.jpg|thumb|right|Surface water entering a moulin on [[Athabasca Glacier]]]]
A '''moulin''' or '''glacier mill''' is a roughly circular, vertical to nearly vertical well-like shaft within a [[glacier]] or [[ice sheet]] which water enters from the surface. The term is derived from the French word for mill.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"&gt;Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P. Mehl, Jr., and J.A. Jackson, J.A., eds. (2005) ''Glossary of Geology'' (5th ed.). Alexandria, Virginia, American Geological Institute. 779 pp. {{ISBN|0-922152-76-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They can be up to 10&amp;nbsp;meters wide and are typically found on ice sheets and flat areas of a glacier in a region of transverse crevasses.&lt;ref name="eo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/moulin-20061211.html |title=Moulin 'Blanc': NASA Expedition Probes Deep Within a Greenland Glacier |author= |accessdate=2009-06-17 |date=Dec 11, 2006 |work=[[Earth Observatory]] |publisher=[[NASA]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moulins can reach the bottom of the glacier, hundreds of meters deep, or may only reach the depth of common crevasse formation (about 10–40&amp;nbsp;m) where the stream flows englacially.&lt;ref name="eo"/&gt; They are the most typical cause for the formation of a [[glacier cave]].

Moulins are parts of the internal structure of glaciers, that carry [[meltwater]] from the surface down to wherever it may go.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7780200.stm |title=Explorers dive under Greenland ice |last=Amos| first=Jonathan |accessdate=2009-06-17 |date=Dec 21, 2008 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water from a moulin often exits the glacier at base level, sometimes into the sea, and occasionally the lower end of a moulin may be exposed in the face of a glacier or at the edge of a stagnant block of [[ice]].

Water from moulins may help lubricate the base of the glacier, affecting [[glacial motion]]. Given an appropriate relationship between an ice sheet and the terrain, the head of water in a moulin can provide the power and medium with which a [[tunnel valley]] may be formed.  The role of this water in lubricating the base of ice sheets and glaciers is complex and it is implicated in [[Greenland ice sheet#Ice sheet acceleration|accelerating the speed of glaciers]] and thus the rate of [[Ice calving|glacial calving]].

[[File:Mount Banahaw Relief Map, SRTM-1.jpg|thumb|Relief Map]]
'''Mount Banahaw''' (alternative spelling: '''Banahao''' or '''Banájao''') is a [[List of active volcanoes in the Philippines|potentially active volcano]] on [[Luzon]] in the [[Philippines]]. The three-peaked [[volcano]] [[complex volcano|complex]] is located between the [[Philippine province|provinces]] of [[Laguna province|Laguna]] and [[Quezon province|Quezon]] and is the tallest mountain in the [[CALABARZON]] region dominating the landscape for miles around.&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt;

The mountain is considered by many as a "[[Sacred mountains|Holy mountain]]", thus a ''bundok [[dambana]]'', and is popular among [[pilgrim]]s along with [[Mountaineering|mountain climbers]].  It is located in a [[protected area]] known as [[Mounts Banahaw–San Cristobal Protected Landscape]] covering {{convert|10901|ha}} of land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pawb.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=64:region-4a&amp;catid=69:regions "Protected Areas in Region IV-A (CALABARZON)"].

==Physical characteristics==
The [[andesitic]] Banahaw volcano complex is composed of several mountains with Mount Banahaw, the largest with a maximum elevation of {{convert|2170|m|ft|0}} [[above mean sea level]].  The summit is topped by a {{convert|1.5|x|3.5|km}} and {{convert|210|m}} deep crater that is breached on the southern rim believed to have been caused by the 1730 eruption.  Prior to 1730, a [[crater lake|lake]] occupied the summit crater of Mount Banahaw. The resulting flood destroyed the town of [[Sariaya, Quezon]] located below the mountain.&lt;ref name="Malapascua"/&gt;

:*[[Mount Banahaw de Lucban]] (at northeastern slope)
:*[[Buho Masalakot Domes]] (at southwestern slope)

* Thermal Areas:

:*Tiaong-San Pablo hot/warm springs

== Importance to locals ==
Banahaw is a traditional [[pilgrimage]] site for locals, believed by many as a "Holy mountain", a spiritually-charged location. The mountain and its environs are considered sacred by local residents; the water from its [[sacred spring]]s are deemed "holy water" for allegedly having beneficial qualities, issuing forth from locations called ''"puestos"'' or "holy sites". These sites are unique natural features composed not only of [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], but also [[cave]]s, [[stream]]s and [[boulder]]s; with names with biblical [[allusion]]s, and shrines erected in, on or around them. These locations were allegedly revealed to a man named Agripino Lontoc by the ''"Santong Boses"'' or the "Holy Voices", which also gave the names to these places way back during the [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|Spanish Colonial Era]]. Another one of this mountain is the adjacent Mount Banahaw de Lucbán.&lt;ref name="Malapascua"&gt;[http://www.malapascua.de/Volcanoe-Map/Mount_Banahaw/mount_banahaw.html "Mount Banahaw"]. Malapascua. Retrieved on 2011-09-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hiking activity on Banahaw==
[[File:Mt Banahaw.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Aerial view of Mt Banahaw from the south-west]]
The mountain is popular not only to [[pilgrim]]s but also among mountain climbers being the closest over {{convert|2000|m|adj=on}} mountain from [[Manila]]. [[Hiking]] activity peaks during [[Holy Week]] each year, with climbers numbering to the thousands. At least four trails exist from [[Dolores, Quezon|Dolores]], [[Sariaya, Quezon|Sariaya]], and other towns of Quezon located on its foothills. The most frequently used trails are the ''Cristalino'' and ''Tatlong Tangke'', taking an average of 9 and 5&amp;nbsp;hours, respectively. These two trails originate from [[Barangay]] Kinabuhayan in [[Dolores, Quezon|Dolores]], and meet near the summit, which is actually the rim of the Banahaw [[caldera]]. On the summit are viewpoints, labeled as ''Durungawan'' I, II, and III, which are the usual destination for pilgrims and hikers.  Other points of interest include the ''"Kuweba ng Diyos Ama"'' ([[tagalog language|Tagalog]]: Cave of [[God the Father]]) and the spring at Brgy. Kinabuhayan, said to have curative powers.&lt;ref name="Malapascua"/&gt;

===Pollution===
Due to incessant climbing activity the mountain trails have become littered with trash. In March 2004, the [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources]] ordered a 5-year suspension of hiking activity in the mountains, covering the Dolores and Sariaya trails. Reopening was delayed was then scheduled to March 2012, but was further extended to February 2015.&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mount Banahaw | publisher=PinoyMountaineer | date= 7 January 2009 | url=http://www.pinoymountaineer.com/2009/01/mt-banahaw-still-closed-mt-cristobal.html | accessdate=2009-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinoymountaineer.com/2010/12/mountain-news-mt-halcon-and-mt-banahaw.html "Mountain News: Mt.

&lt;!----------IMAGES END-----&gt;
'''Mullard Limited''' was a British manufacturer of [[electronics|electronic]] components. The '''Mullard Radio Valve Co. Ltd.''' of [[Southfields]], London, was founded in 1920 by Captain [[Stanley R. Mullard]], who had previously designed [[thermionic valves]] for the Admiralty before becoming managing director of the Z Electric Lamp Co. The company soon moved to [[Hammersmith]], London and then in 1923 to [[Balham]], London. The head office in later years was Mullard House at 1–19 Torrington Place, [[Bloomsbury]], now part of [[University College London]].

==Partnership with Philips==
In 1923, to meet the technical demands of the newly formed [[BBC]], Mullard formed a partnership with the Dutch manufacturer [[Philips]].  The [[vacuum tube|valves]] (vacuum tubes) produced in this period were named with the prefix PM, for Philips-Mullard, beginning with the PM3 and PM4 in 1926. Mullard finally sold all its shares to Philips in 1927. In 1928 the company introduced the first [[pentode]] valve to the British market.

==Factories==

===Mitcham===
Mullard opened a new manufacturing plant at Willow Lane, [[Mitcham]], Surrey in 1929. A second building was added in 1936. Both buildings had a very distinctive flat roof construction and were very similar to those at Philips' headquarters in [[Eindhoven]], Netherlands. Co-sited with the Mullard buildings was the manufacturing complex for Philips Radios.  Mitcham was also home to the Mullard Application Laboratory.

===Blackburn===
In the late 1930s Mullard opened a new plant in [[Blackburn]], Lancashire. By 1949 Mullard had produced a number of television sets, such as the MTS-521 and MTS-684. In 1951 Mullard was producing the LSD series of photographic flash tubes.

===Others===
Mullard had factories in [[Southport]] and [[Simonstone, Lancashire|Simonstone]], near [[Padiham]] both in [[Lancashire]]. The latter closed in 2004. There was also a sister factory at Belmont in [[Durham, England|Durham]] (closed in June 2005).&lt;ref name="Grimley_2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mullard &amp; CES - Mullard &amp; Combined Electronic Services (CES) |author-first=Robert |author-last=Grimley |date=2016 |orig-year=2011 |work=Early Philips Colour TV |url=http://www.philipstv.org.uk:80/blog/early-philips-colour-tv/mullard-combined-electronic-services-ces/ |access-date=2017-01-14 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027082741/http://www.philipstv.org.uk:80/blog/early-philips-colour-tv/mullard-combined-electronic-services-ces/ |archive-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/mar/02/17 |title=Union says LG Philips is to close Durham factory |first=Mark |last=Milner |date=2 March 2005 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/lg-philips-closure-marks-end-4611959 |title=LG Philips closure marks end of an era |date=23 July 2005 |newspaper=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pepnet.org.uk/RWoodcock/And%20then%20there%20were%20none.pdf |title=And Then There Were None

A feeder factory at [[Haydock]] closed in 1981. A small factory in Hove closed in the early 1970s.

==Teletext==
{{main|SAA5050}}
In the early 1980s, Mullard manufactured the [[SAA5050]], some of the earliest [[teletext]] decoding modules made in the UK.

==Semiconductors==
[[File:Early Mullard small signal transistor packages.jpg|thumb|Mullard transistors of the 1960s, showing the variety of SO-2 packages used:
{{ubl|OC200, silicon PNP transistor in an aluminium can.
|Germanium OC45 in a black-painted glass package.
|OC45 in a clear glass and blue putty package, with rubber sleeve}}]]
Mullard owned [[semiconductor]] factories in [[Southampton]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]]. Both sites were owned by [[NXP Semiconductors]] (formerly [[Philips Semiconductors]]). The Southampton site is now closed. The one in [[Hazel Grove]], Stockport specialises in [[power semiconductor device]]s.

The first [[transistor]]s produced by Mullard were the OC50 and OC51 point-contact types, which were not widely used. In 1953 Mullard moved to junction transistors, beginning with the plastic-cased OC10 series.  These were followed by the glass-encapsulated OC43...47,&lt;ref&gt;Note: Mullard's OC43...47s were germanium-PNP, while [[Clevite|Clevite-Intermetall]]'s OC43...47s, sold at the same time, were silicon-PNP&lt;/ref&gt; OC70/71, and OC80 series (the output devices were metal encapsulated to facilitate heatsinking), which were produced in large numbers and copied by other companies, such as {{ill|Valvo (company){{!}}Valvo|de|Valvo}} (another Philips subsidiary) and [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] in Germany, and [[Amperex]] in the USA. RF transistors were the OC170 and OC171. All these were germanium PNP transistors. In 1964 the company produced a prototype electronic desktop [[calculator]] as a technology demonstrator for its transistors and [[cold cathode]] indicator tubes.

==Space science==
In 1957 Philips-Mullard helped to set up the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory]] (MRAO) at the [[University of Cambridge]]. In 1966 the [[Mullard Space Science Laboratory]] (MSSL) was opened near [[Dorking]], Surrey as part of [[University College London]]. The [[Royal Society]] [[Mullard Award]]&lt;ref name=mullardmedallists&gt;{{cite web |url=https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/awards/mullard-award/ |title=Royal Society Mullard Award: Mullard Medallists |year=2016 |work=[[Royal Society]] |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719114301/https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/awards/mullard-award/ |archivedate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/funding.asp?id=4870 |title=Mullard Award |work=Royal Society |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014220617/http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/funding.asp?id=4870 |archivedate=14 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; for young scientists and engineers was set up in 1967.

==Mullard brand name==
Philips continued to use the brand name "Mullard" in the UK until 1988. Mullard Research Laboratories in [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], Surrey then became Philips Research Laboratories. As of 2007, the Mullard brand has been revived by [[Sovtek]], producing a variant of the [[ECC83]] and [[EL34]].

==Z Electric Lamp Company==
The Z Electric Lamp Co. continued business into the 1970s operating from premises in [[Thornton Heath]], South London, manufacturing lamps of specialised design. However, it closed due to the recession in the mid 1970s.

The '''National Parks Act 1980''' ({{lang-ms|Akta Taman Negara 1980}}) is a [[Malaysia]]n [[federal law]] that governs the creation and the maintenance [[national park]]s in Malaysia. It was created in 1980 during the controversy surrounding the protection of [[Endau Rompin National Park|Endau Rompin forest complex]]. The act provides for the [[States of Malaysia|states]] to establish national parks to be administered by [[Department of Wildlife and National Parks]] under the federal government.

During its passing, the debate on state and federal power was common. The states and in particular [[Johor]] within the context of that time did not agree to the act as it was seen as surrendering states' right to the federal government. This objection prevented the Endau and Rompin from being gazetted as a national park prior to the 1990s. The act still gives rights for the State Authority to vote sections of land can be preserved for maintenance of roads, airstrips, reservoirs, dams, and service buildings. 

This Act shall not apply to Sabah and Sarawak and the State Parks of Kelantan, Pahang and Terengganu which together constitute the Taman Negara as described in the Schedule to the Taman Negara (Kelantan) Enactment [En. 14 of 1938] and in the First Schedules to the Taman Negara (Pahang) Enactment 1939 [En. 2 of 1938] and the Taman Negara (Terengganu) Enactment [En. 6 of 1358H].


==Structure==
The National Parks Act 1980, in its current form (1 January 2013), consists of 11 sections and no schedule (including 2 amendments), without separate Part.
*Section 1: Short title and application
*Section 2: Interpretation
*Section 3: Establishment of National Park
*Section 4: Object of establishment of National Parks
*Section 5: National Parks Advisory Council
*Section 6: Functions of National Parks Advisory Council
*Section 7: Establishment of National Parks committees
*Section 8: Director General and other persons to be responsible for proper carrying out of provisions of Act
*Section 9: Occupation of land within National Park
*Section 10: General prohibition of mining within National Park
*Section 11: Regulations

==National Park Establishment==
In preservation of the lands, the State Authority has the right to request areas of reserved land to be placed under the control of the National Park committee. This establishment was created to protect wild life and objects of the environment while promoting education of conservation to the people of Malaysia. 

==National Park Advisory Council and its functions==
The National Park Advisory Council was established to create a representative body for the National Parks. This would ensure different levels within the council to ensure different checks on committees. Positions include Chairman, State Secretary of each State where National Parks are located, Director General, Treasurer, representative of the Economic Planning Unit of the Prime Minister's Department, representative of the Tourist Development Corporation, and representative of the Department of Forestry. &lt;ref&gt; Laws of Malaysia Act 226: National Parks Act 1980 &lt;/ref&gt; These positions will ensure the conservation and development of the National Park.  

==Occupation of lands==  
Any land that is leased by the State Authorities are under the consideration of the National Park which can be used for the construction and maintenance or roads, airstrips, dams and reservoirs, hotels, rest houses, dwelling houses, buildings, works of public utility, and mining. Several restrictions do come with the general prohibition of mining within the National Park such as the contradiction of general interests to the State and the failure to have a license to mine. Although the land can be used for mining, there is general restrictions prohibiting the use of mining within the National Park. In order for mining to occur, the National Park must see a mining certificate or lease issued that grants rights to the passage. Without such, there will be implications due to the respect o the National Park Land. 

==Regulation of lands==  
The State Authority may still make regulations to the Act that will further the protection of the wildlife or land preservation. Acts include prohibition of killing, capturing wildlife, burning or cutting down vegetation within the National Park, or other regulations of misconduct that would harm the enjoyment of the National Park.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14715">From 1946 through 1993, thirteen countries (fourteen, if the USSR and Russia are considered separately) used ocean disposal or ocean dumping as a method to dispose of nuclear/[[radioactive waste]]. The waste materials included both liquids and solids housed in various containers, as well as reactor vessels, with and without spent or damaged [[nuclear fuel]].&lt;ref name=IAEA_te_1105&gt;IAEA [http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/te_1105_prn.pdf TECDOC-1105 “Inventory of radioactive waste disposals at sea” August 1999] retrieved 2011-12-4&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1993, ocean disposal has been banned by international treaties. ([[London Convention (1972)]], [[Basel Convention]], [[MARPOL 73/78]])

However, according to the United Nations, some companies have been dumping radioactive waste and other hazardous materials into the coastal waters of [[Somalia]], taking advantage of the fact that the country had no functioning government from the early 1990s onwards. According to one official at the United Nations, this caused health problems for locals in the coastal region and posed a significant danger to Somalia's fishing industry and local marine life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4312553.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Africa – Waves 'brought waste to Somalia'|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Ocean floor disposal]]" (or sub-seabed disposal)—a more deliberate method of delivering radioactive waste to the ocean floor and depositing it into the seabed—was studied by the UK and Sweden, but never implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Nuclear Association]]

Disposal projects attempted to locate ideal dumping sites based on depth, stability and currents, and to treat, solidify and contain the waste. However, some dumping only involved diluting the waste with surface water, or used containers that imploded at depth. Even containers that survived the pressure could physically decay over time.

== Environmental impact ==
Data are from IAEA-TECDOC-1105.&lt;ref name=IAEA_te_1105/&gt;{{rp|7}}

===Arctic Ocean  ===

Joint Russian-Norwegian expeditions (1992–94) collected samples from four dump sites. At immediate vicinity of waste containers, elevated levels of radionuclide were found, but had not contaminated the surrounding area.

===North-East Atlantic Ocean ===

Dumping was undertaken by UK, Switzerland, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Italy.
IAEA had been studying since 1977. The report of 1996, by CRESP suggests measurable leakages of radioactive material, and, concluded that environmental impact is negligible.

===North-East Pacific Ocean, North-West Atlantic Ocean dump sites of USA===

These sites are monitored by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and US [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]. So far, no excess level of radionuclides was found in samples (sea water, sediments) collected in the area, except the sample taken at a location close to disposed packages that contained elevated levels of isotopes of caesium and plutonium.

===North-West Pacific Ocean dump sites of USSR, Japan, Russia and Korea===

The joint Japanese-Korean-Russian expedition (1994–95) concluded that contamination resulted mainly from global fallout.

'''Panchagavya''' or '''panchakavyam''' is prepared by mixing five products of [[cow]] and used in traditional [[hindu]] rituals. The three direct constituents are cow [[manure|dung]], [[urine]], and [[milk]]; the two derived products are [[curd]] and [[ghee]]. These are mixed in proper ratio and then allowed to ferment.  [[Panchamrita]] is a similar mixture that replaces dung and urine with honey and sugar. The mixture which is made using yeast as a fermenter, bananas, groundnut cake, and the water of tender coconut, is believed to be a potent [[organic compound|organic]] [[pesticide]] and growth promoter - 

The [[Sanskrit]] word ''Panchagavya'' means "mixture of five cow products". It is also called '''cowpathy''' treatment based on products obtained from [[cow]]s used in [[Ayurvedic]] medicine and of religious significance for [[Hindu]]s. Panchgavya is also used as [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticides]] in agricultural operations, &lt;ref name=dhk&gt;[http://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:ijcs&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=1&amp;article=001 Dhama K. et al., ''Panchgavya (Cowpathy): An Overview'', International Journal of Cow Science, 2005:vol 1:issue 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Kumar|title=Environment &amp; agriculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7pjZDNbmT4C&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=1 January 2005|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-7648-921-8|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality standards of Panchagavya are mentioned in Ayurvedic [[Pharmacopoeia of India]]. [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|CSIR]] has obtained some patents regarding Panchagavya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=87162|title=Medicinal Usage of Pancha|author= |date=31 August 2012|work= |publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of India|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation of panchagavya==

Panchagavya consists of nine products. cow dung, cow urine, milk, curd, jaggery, ghee, banana, tender coconut, and water.&lt;ref name="Agri"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agritech.tnau.ac.in/org_farm/orgfarm_panchakavya.html|title=Panchakavya|author= |date= |work =|publisher=Tamil Nadu agricultural university,India|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cow dung and urine  are thoroughly mixed in the morning and evening, and kept for 3 days. After setting, it is mixed regularly for another 15 days, and then added to the other ingredients, and left to sit for another 30 days. Panchagavya is stored in a wide-mouthed earthen pot or concrete tank in open. Sufficient shade is usually provided. It is sometimes diluted before use.Process should be conducted in step wise

==Scientific evidence==

Scientific studies have been performed to test the efficacy of Panchagavya and cow dung as a medical intervention. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chemotherapeutic Potential of Cow Urine: A Review|journal=Journal of Intercultural Ethnopharmacology|date=2015|issue=4.2|pages=180–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ayushportal.nic.in/panchagavya.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A common usage is as a fertilizer and pesticide.&lt;ref name=dhk/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar2005"/&gt; Seeds can be treated with panchagavya.

'''Sharon Pincott''', an Australian, is a specialist in the field of [[African elephant]] behaviour, and author. She has studied the [[social structure]] and [[population dynamics]] of a single clan of wild elephants extensively and is an advocate for ending ivory trade and promoting conservation.

== Background ==
Pincott grew up in the small town of [[Grantham, Queensland]] in the [[Lockyer Valley Region]] in [[Australia's]] east. She originally worked in the field of [[Information Technology]] (IT) and progressed to the position of National Director of IT for [[Ernst &amp; Young]] [[Australia]] based in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gattonstar.com.au/news/granthams-wildlife-warrior/3025747/|title=Grantham’s wildlife warrior|first=Tom|last=Threadingham|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zimbabwe-focused work==
Pincott worked alone, on a full-time voluntary basis,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cen.org.au/projects/land-for-wildlife/regional-provider-news/473-elephant-dawn-by-sharon-pincott-allen-and-unwin-reviewed-by-john-asquith|title=Elephant Dawn by Sharon Pincott, (Allen and Unwin) Reviewed by John Asquith|first=Nick|last=Baron|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alvarezgalloso.com/2009/04/04/new-book-the-elephant-and-i-by-sharon-pincott/|title=New Book: “The Elephant and I” by Sharon Pincott|date=4 April 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for 13 years (2001-2014) with the clan of wild, free-roaming, elephants known as the Presidential Elephants of Zimbabwe on land bordering the Main Camp entrance to [[Hwange National Park]]. She acquired a reputation for being able to "talk to the elephants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/STE-SA/talking-to-elephantsLawson|title=Mabhena, Sunday News (7 August 2011) Zimbabwe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, eight years after arriving in Zimbabwe, Pincott was appointed [[South Africa]] ''Getaway'' magazine's 'Elephant [[Ambassador]] in Africa' "in recognition of her courageous work with wildlife in Hwange".&lt;ref&gt;Editor (November 2009), ''Introducing Getaway's 'Elephant Ambassador in Africa'; A life in love with elephants'', ''Getaway'' magazine, South Africa p.43&lt;/ref&gt;   Pincott subsequently came to the attention of Natural History Unit Africa and became the subject of the  documentary titled ''All the President's Elephants''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://offthefence.com/Brand/1871/all-the-presidents-elephants Off the Fence Production Company (2012) ''All the President's Elephants,'' 60 minute, South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes her wire snare removal work with colleagues called in to dart injured elephants using a [[tranquillizer gun]]. It also features Pincott's work successfully recommending and encouraging President [[Robert Mugabe]] to reaffirm his commitment to this clan of elephants, in an effort to secure their future. 

[[File:Sharon Pincott 2009 in Hwange.jpg|thumb|Sharon Pincott in Hwange (2009)]]
From December 2017 Pincott was active in voicing widespread opposition to scores more young elephants being captured, forcibly taken from their mothers and families inside Hwange National Park and transported to Chinese zoos, appealing to Zimbabwe's new President [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]] for an immediate review of policy and ultimately delivering a petition that attracted 287,509 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezimbabwean.co/2017/12/another-disgrace-zimbabwe-another-elephant-disgrace/|title=Another Disgrace Zimbabwe; another 'Elephant' Disgrace - The Zimbabwean|date=29 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezimbabwean.co/2018/01/zim-elephant-capture-petition-attracts-over-a-quarter-of-a-million/|title=Zim Elephant Capture Petition attracts over a Quarter-of-a-Million - The Zimbabwean|date=19 January 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezimbabwean.co/2018/02/dear-mr-president-re-zimbabwe-elephant-captures/|title=Dear Mr President - Re Zimbabwe Elephant Captures - The Zimbabwean|date=7 February 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezimbabwean.co/2018/05/open-letter-to-zimbabwe-president-mnangagwa/|title=Open Letter to Zimbabwe President Mnangagwa on behalf of 287,509 concerned would-be tourists around the globe - The Zimbabwean|date=14 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author==
She has published three  books: ''The Elephants and I'' (Jacana Media, South Africa 2009), ''Battle for the President's Elephants'' (Jacana Media, South Africa 2012) and ''Elephant Dawn'' (first published by [[Allen &amp; Unwin]], Australia 2016, and then by Jacana Media, South Africa 2016). She is also the author of two earlier elephant works self-published in Zimbabwe, ''In An Elephant's Rumble'' (2004, {{ISBN|079742864X}}) and ''A Year Less Ordinary'' (2006, {{ISBN|0797431667}}).

==Ivory trade==
For [[World Wildlife Day]] 2017 Pincott collaborated with the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]] in an attempt to help bring an end to the [[Ivory trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifaw.org/australia/news/ending-ivory-trade-world-wildlife-day|title=Ending ivory trade this World Wildlife Day - IFAW - International Fund for Animal Welfare|website=www.ifaw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[International Women's Day]] 2017 Pincott was acknowledged by associates of the [[Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland]], Australia, as "blazing a trail for elephants as well as women working in conservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blankgc.com.au/queensland-woman-spends-13-years-with-elephants-in-africa/|title=The Queensland woman who spent 13 years with a single clan of African elephants|date=4 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late March 2017, almost 3 years after leaving her Hwange elephant work, Pincott was still being acknowledged by the Zimbabwe press for her "profound dedication to the Presidential Elephants", in a country increasingly known for hostility towards conservationists who speak out against wildlife-related corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.co.zw/2017/03/31/zimbabwe-hostile-conservationists-2/|title=Zimbabwe hostile to conservationists - The Standard|date=31 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, after a male [[big-game hunter]] was crushed to death in Hwange when an adult female elephant, felled by gunfire, landed on him, Pincott reasoned in an interview that it was "likely" to be a known Presidential Elephant female that was shot in this hunting party incident, and highlighted the ongoing ineffectuality of Mugabe's Presidential Decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thezimbabwean.co/2017/05/shot-presidential-elephant-fall-hunter-theunis-botha-hwange/|title=Did a shot ‘Presidential’ elephant fall on hunter Theunis Botha in Hwange? - The Zimbabwean|date=25 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health  ==

In 2017 Pincott revealed that she was suffering from rare, incurable, autoimmune [[connective tissue disease]] believed by medical researchers to be both environment- and stress-related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thezimbabwean.co/2017/02/rare-experiences-wild-elephants-hwange-zimbabwe-living-incurable-rare-diseases/|title=From rare experiences with wild elephants in Hwange, zimbabwe, Sharon Pincott is now living with "rare diseases" - The Zimbabwean|date=28 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Simsapa tree''' ([[Pali language|Pali]]: {{IAST|''siṃsapā''}}) is mentioned in ancient [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] discourses traditionally believed to have been delivered 2,500 years ago. The tree has been identified as either ''[[Dalbergia sissoo]]'',&lt;ref&gt;For example, Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 708, entry for "Siŋsapā" (retrieved 17 Nov 2008 from "U. Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1:104.pali) associates the simsapa tree with "Dalbergia sisu."&lt;/ref&gt; a rosewood tree common to India and southeast Asia, or ''[[Amherstia nobilis]]'', another South Asian tree, of the family [[Caesalpiniaceae]].

==Buddhist scriptural references==
In Buddhism's [[Pali Canon]],&lt;ref&gt;The Pali Canon is the main scriptural source for [[Theravada Buddhism]] and is at least nominally incorporated in the canons of other branches of Buddhism as well.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a [[Sūtra|discourse]] entitled, "The Simsapa Grove" ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 56.31).  This discourse is described as having been delivered by the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] to [[bhikkhu|monk]]s while dwelling beneath a simsapa grove in the city of [[Kosambi]].  In this discourse, the Buddha compares a few simsapa leaves in his hand with the number of simsapa leaves overhead in the grove to illustrate what he teaches (in particular, the [[Four Noble Truths]]) and what he does not teach (things unrelated to the holy life).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), pp. 1857-58; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.031.than.html Thanissaro (1997);] and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/walshe/wheel318.html#passage-68 Walshe (1985), sutta 68.]  Note that in an endnote to this sutta [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/walshe/wheel318.html#n-313 (n. 313)], Walshe states that this tree is "also known as the [[Ashoka tree|Asoka tree]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in the Pali Canon, simsapa groves are mentioned in the "Payasi Sutta" ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 23)&lt;ref&gt;Walshe (1987), p. 351.  This discourse is said to have been given in [[Kosala]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in the "Hatthaka Discourse" ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.34).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.034.than.html Thanissaro (1999).]  This discourse is said to have been given near Alavi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For both canonical and [[atthakatha|post-canonical]] references, see Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 708, entry for "Siŋsapā" (retrieved 17 Nov 2008 from "U. Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1:104.pali).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soil test''' may refer to one or more of a wide variety of soil analysis conducted for one of several possible reasons. Possibly the most widely conducted soil tests are those done to estimate the plant-available concentrations of [[plant nutrition|plant nutrients]], in order to determine fertilizer recommendations in agriculture. Other soil tests may be done for engineering ([[geotechnical investigation|geotechnical]]), [[geochemical]] or [[ecological]] investigations.

== Plant nutrition ==
In [[agriculture]], a '''soil test''' commonly refers to the [[analysis]] of a [[soil]] sample to determine [[nutrient]] content, composition, and other characteristics such as the [[acidity]] or [[pH level]]. A soil test can determine [[fertility]], or the expected growth potential of the soil which indicates nutrient deficiencies, potential toxicities from excessive fertility and inhibitions from the presence of non-essential [[trace mineral]]s. The test is used to mimic the function of roots to assimilate minerals.  The expected rate of growth is modeled by the [[Law of the Maximum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iP7LWpn5oJ0C&amp;pg=SL4-PA89&amp;lpg=SL4-PA89&amp;dq=%22law+of+maximum%22+wallace&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rUUDE5U2SD&amp;sig=4OKtubPJivYnLzM4QhHT_mbV52k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rJRBTaWLKYiCsQP9sc3_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg |title=Soil Science - Malcolm E. Sumner - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[laboratory|Labs]], such as those at [[Iowa State]] and [[Colorado State University]], recommend that a soil test contains 10-20 sample points for every  {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of field. [[Tap water]] or chemicals can change the composition of the soil, and may need to be tested separately. As soil nutrients vary with depth and soil components change with time, the depth and timing of a sample may also affect results.

Composite sampling can be performed by combining soil from several locations prior to analysis. This is a common procedure, but should be used judiciously to avoid skewing results. This procedure must be done so that government sampling requirements are met. A reference map should be created to record the location and quantity of field samples in order to properly interpret test results.

=== Storage, handling, and moving ===
Soil chemistry changes over time, as biological and chemical processes break down or combine compounds over time. These processes change once the soil is removed from its natural ecosystem (flora and fauna that penetrate the sampled area) and environment (temperature, moisture, and solar light/radiation cycles). As a result, the chemical composition analysis accuracy can be improved if the soil is analysed soon after its extraction — usually within a relative time period of 24 hours. The chemical changes in the soil can be slowed during storage and transportation by freezing it. Air drying can also preserve the soil sample for many months.

===Soil testing===
Soil testing is often performed by commercial labs that offer a variety of tests, targeting groups of compounds and minerals. The advantages associated with local lab is that they are familiar with the chemistry of the soil in the area where the sample was taken. This enables technicians to recommend the tests that are most likely to reveal useful information.

[[File:Soil test.JPG|thumb|Soil testing in progress]]
Laboratory tests often check for plant nutrients in three categories:
* Major nutrients: [[nitrogen]] (N), [[phosphorus]] (P), and [[potassium]] (K)
* Secondary nutrients: [[sulfur]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]]
* Minor nutrients: [[iron]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[boron]], [[molybdenum]], chlorine

The amount of plant available soil [[phosphorus]] is most often measured with a chemical extraction method, and different countries have different standard methods. Just in Europe, more than 10 different soil P tests are currently in use and the results from these tests are not directly comparable with each other&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jordan-Meille|first=L.|last2=Rubæk|first2=G. H.|last3=Ehlert|first3=P. a. I.|last4=Genot|first4=V.|last5=Hofman|first5=G.|last6=Goulding|first6=K.|last7=Recknagel|first7=J.|last8=Provolo|first8=G.|last9=Barraclough|first9=P.|date=2012-12-01|title=An overview of fertilizer-P recommendations in Europe: soil testing, calibration and fertilizer recommendations|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2012.00453.x/abstract|journal=Soil Use and Management|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=419–435|doi=10.1111/j.1475-2743.2012.00453.x|issn=1475-2743}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[Do-it-yourself]] kits usually only test for the three "major nutrients", and for soil [[acidity]] or [[pH level]]. Do-it-yourself kits are often sold at farming cooperatives, university labs, private labs, and some hardware and gardening stores. [[Electrical meter]]s that measure pH, water content, and sometimes nutrient content of the soil are also available at many hardware stores. Laboratory tests are more accurate than tests with do-it-yourself kits and electrical meters. Here is an example [http://us.wlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/samplesoilreport.pdf soil sample report] from one laboratory.

Soil testing is used to facilitate fertilizer composition and dosage selection for land employed in both agricultural and horticultural industries.

Prepaid mail-in kits for soil and ground water testing are available to facilitate the packaging and delivery of samples to a laboratory. Similarly, in 2004, laboratories began providing fertilizer recommendations along with the soil composition report.

Lab tests are more accurate and often utilize very precise [[Flow injection analysis|flow injection]] technology, though both types are useful. In addition, lab tests frequently include professional interpretation of results and recommendations. Always refer to all proviso statements included in a lab report as they may outline any anomalies, exceptions, and shortcomings in the sampling and/or analytical process/results.

Some laboratories analyze for all 13 mineral nutrients and a dozen non-essential, potentially toxic minerals utilizing the "universal soil extractant" ([[ammonium bicarbonate]] [[DTPA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.wlabs.com/suitable-import-borrow-topsoil-or-reclaimed-soil/ |title=wlabs.com |publisher=wlabs.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Soil contaminants==
Common mineral [[soil contaminant]]s include [[arsenic]], [[barium]], [[cadmium]], [[copper]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]], and [[zinc]].

Lead is a particularly dangerous soil component. The following table from the [[University of Minnesota]] categorizes typical soil concentration levels and their associated health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carl J. Rosen |url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/horticulture/DG2543.html |title=Lead in the Home Garden and Urban Soil Environment |publisher=Extension.umn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Six gardening practices to reduce the lead risk

# Locate gardens away from old painted structures and heavily traveled roads
# Give planting preferences to fruiting crops (tomatoes, squash, peas, sunflowers, corn, etc.)
# Incorporate organic materials such as finished compost, humus, and peat moss
# Lime soil as recommended by soil test (pH 6.5 minimizes lead availability)
# Discard old and outer leaves before eating leafy vegetables; peel root crops; wash all produce
# Keep dust to a minimum by maintaining a mulched and/or moist soil surface

The [[Fortunian]] [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] and presently unnamed Cambrian [[Cambrian Stage 2|Stage 2]] are the stages within this series. The Terreneuvian corresponds to the pre-[[trilobite|trilobitic]] Cambrian.&lt;ref name="Li 2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=G.|title=The Fad of Watsonella Crosbyi|url=http://www.casp.cam.ac.uk/meetings/meeting-20110612|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Terreneuvian is derived from ''Terre Neuve'', a French name for the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Canada]], where many rocks of this age are found, including the [[type section]].&lt;ref name=Landing /&gt;&lt;ref name=PengBabcock /&gt;

== Type locality ==
The type locality ([[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|GSSP]]) of the Terreneuvian is in [[Fortune Head]], at the northern edge of the [[Burin Peninsula]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Canada]] ({{Coord|47.0762|N|55.8310|W|display=inline}}). The outcrops show a carbonate-siliciclastic succession which is mapped as the [[Chapel Island Formation]]. The formation is divided into the following members that are composed of peritidal sandstones and shales (Member 1), muddy deltaic and shelf sandstones and mudstones (Member 2A), laminated siltstones (Member 2B and 3) and mudstones and limestones of the inner shelf (Member 4). The Precambrian-Cambrian boundary lies 2.4&amp;nbsp;m above the base of the second member, which is the lowest occurrence of ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]''. The traces can be seen on the lower surface of the sandstone layers. The first calcareous shelled skeletal fossils ''([[Ladatheca cylindrica]])'' are 400 m above the boundary. The first [[trilobites]] appear 1400 m above the boundary, which corresponds to the beginning of the [[Branchian Series]].&lt;ref name="Brasier 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brasier|first=Martin|author2=John Cowie |author3=Michael Taylor |title=Decision on the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary stratotype|journal=Episodes|year=1994|volume=17|issue=1-2|pages=95–100|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/GSSP/file46.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
The youngest of eight children of [[Daniel Waldron]] and Olive Huske Sheafe Waldron of [[Dover, New Hampshire]], and named after his [[Thomas Westbrook Waldron|grandfather]], he was born May 1, 1814.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;C.H. Cutts Howard, ''Genealogy of the Cutts Family of America'', (1892), entry 1390, p.123 at https://archive.org/stream/genealogyofcutts00howa#page/122/mode/2up/search/hong+kong accessed 22 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  An older [[Thomas Westbrook Waldron (Canada)|cousin]] of the same name had moved away prior to his birth and the name was re-used.

==Wilkes Expedition==
With his oldest brother [[Richard Russell Waldron]] he joined the Wilkes Expedition which explored a portion of the coast of [[Antarctica]], some of the Pacific islands, and the coast of what is now [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]].  [[Waldron Glacier]] in the Antarctic is named after him.  [[Waldron Island]] is named after him or his brother.&lt;ref&gt;‘was probably intended for Thomas W. Waldron, Captain’s Clerk of the brig Porpoise of the expedition. However, it is possible that two men were honoured in the one name as R. R. Waldron was Purser of the Vincennes, another vessel of the expedition.’ (Meany, E. S. (1923)). ''Origin of Washington Geographic Names'', University of Washington Press, Seattle. as cited in Patrick J. M. Waldron, "Waldron Family History", June 30, 2009, pp.5, 8 at: http://www.binary.co.nz/WALDRON3.PDF accessed 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Consul to Hong Kong and Macau==
For reasons that are not presently very clear, in December 1843 he was nominated by President [[John Tyler]] to the office of United States consul to Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress.

The '''Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas''' ({{zh|s=云南三江并流|p=Yúnnān Sānjiāng Bìngliú}}) is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in [[Yunnan]] province, China. It lies within the [[drainage basin]]s of the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze]] (Jinsha), Lancang ([[Mekong]]) and Nujiang ([[Salween]]) rivers, in the Yunnan section of the [[Hengduan Mountains]].&lt;ref name=WHL&gt;{{cite web|author= UNESCO World Heritage Centre 1992-2016|website= World Heritage List|title= Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas|url= http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1083|accessdate= 2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:R0010879.JPG|thumb|[[Meili Xue Shan]]—Meili Snow Mountains, in Yunnan Protected Area.]]

===Geography===
The protected areas extend over 15 core areas, totalling 939,441.4&amp;nbsp;ha, and buffer areas, totalling 758,977.8&amp;nbsp;ha across a region of 180&amp;nbsp;km by 310&amp;nbsp;km. Here, for a distance of over 300&amp;nbsp;km, three of [[List of the longest Asian rivers|Asia's great rivers]] run roughly parallel to one another though separated by high mountain ranges with peaks over 6,000 meters. After this area of near [[confluence]], the rivers greatly diverge: the [[Nujiang River]] becomes Salween and empties out at [[Mawlamyaing|Moulmein]], [[Burma]], into the [[Indian Ocean]], the Lancang becomes the [[Mekong]] and south of [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Vietnam]], empties out into the [[South China Sea]] and the [[Yangtze]] flows into the [[East China Sea]] at [[Shanghai]]. Selected nature reserves and places of scenic beauty in this unique region were collectively awarded World Heritage Site status in 2003 for their very rich biodiversity and outstanding topographical diversity.

Running parallel to these three rivers, but to the west inside Burma, is the river gorge of the N'Mai river, the main tributary to the [[Irrawaddy River]].

===Biology===
In its description, [[UNESCO]] mentions: "(It) may be the most biologically diverse [[temperate region]] on earth" and "An exceptional range of topographical features - from [[gorge]]s to [[karst]] to glaciated peaks -- is associated with the site being at a 'collision point' of [[tectonic plates]]".

Due to its topography and geographical location, the ''Three Parallel Rivers'' region contains many climate types. Average annual precipitation ranges from 4,600&amp;nbsp;mm in the Dulongjian area in the west of [[Gongshan]] county to 300&amp;nbsp;mm in the upper valleys of the Yangtze river.  The protected areas are home to around 6,000 species of plants, 173 species of mammals, and 417 species of birds. Many of the flora and fauna species are [[endemism|endemic]] to the region.

===Culture===
Although this region has been acknowledged as a ''natural'' World Heritage Site, its demographic make-up also is highly interesting as it contains many of the twenty-five minorities found in Yunnan province including the [[Derung]], the smallest of all of China's minority groups. Some of the other minorities found in this region are the [[Tibetan people]], the [[Nu people]], [[Lisu people|Lisu]], [[Bai people|Bai]], [[Pumi people|Pumi]] and [[Naxi people|Naxi]]. Many of these minorities still use [[traditional costume]]s as their normal daily attire.

In the same region as the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas lies the [[Old Town of Lijiang]], which is also a World Heritage Site in its own right.

==Protected areas==
[[File:Yangzi River - by Peter Morgan.jpg|thumb|The upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]], bearing north having just emerged from the [[Tiger Leaping Gorge]].]]
The Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas consists of fifteen protected areas, in eight geographic clusters. The areas include:

* The three separate sections of the [[Gaoligongshan National Nature Reserve]]
* [[Haba Xueshan]] Nature Reserve, with the [[Tiger Leaping Gorge]]
* Bita Lake Nature Reserve, part of [[Pudacuo National Park]], in [[Shangri-La County]]
* [[Yunling Mountains|Yunling]] Nature Reserve
* [[Gongshan]] Scenic Area
* Yueliangshan Scenic Area in [[Fugong County]] (also known as Stone Moon mountain)
* Pianma Scenic Area in [[Lushui County]]
* Baima-[[Meili Xue Shan|Meili Xue Shan—Meili Snow mountain range]] Reserve, with the highest peak, at {{convert|6740|m|ft}}, of the protected areas.
* Julong Lake Scenic Area, in [[Deqin County]]
* Laowoshan Scenic Area, in [[Fugong County]]
* Hongshan Scenic Area, part of [[Pudacuo National Park]] in Shangri-La County
* Qianhushan (Thousand Lake Mountain) Scenic Area, in Shangri-La County
* Laojunshan Scenic Area, in [[Lanping Bai and Pumi Autonomous County]]

==Flora and fauna==
[[File:C.the takin herd.jpg|thumb|A herd of [[takin]] in [[Gongshan Derung and Nu Autonomous County]]]]
According to UNESCO "The area covered by the World Heritage site is claimed to be the most [[biodiversity|biodiverse]] and least disturbed [[temperate]] [[ecosystem]]s in the world".
;Flora
The protected [[terrestrial ecoregion]] areas of this [[biodiversity hotspot]] are for a large part covered with both temperate [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous]] and [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|broadleaf forest]]s. The protected areas are home to around 6,000 species of plants, many of which are [[endemism|endemic]] to the region.  More than 200 varieties of [[rhododendron]] and more than 100 species of [[gentian]]s and [[primula]]s are found in the areas.

;Fauna
The fauna found in the areas includes 173 species of mammals, of which 81 are endemic, and 417 species of birds, of which 22 are endemic. Some of the mammals which inhabit these regions are the endemic [[black snub-nosed monkey]], the [[Indian leopard]], [[snow leopard]], and [[clouded leopard]]; the [[Gaoligong pika]], [[Gongshan muntjac]], [[Chinese shrew mole]], and [[capped langur]]; the [[stump-tailed macaque]], [[Asiatic wild dog]], [[black musk deer]], and [[takin]]; the [[smooth-coated otter]], [[hoolock gibbon]], [[Asian black bear]] and [[red panda]].

Rare bird species in the areas include [[chestnut-throated partridge]], the [[Lady Amherst's pheasant]], [[white-eared pheasant]], [[Yunnan nuthatch]], and [[giant nuthatch]]; the [[white-speckled laughingthrush]], [[ferruginous duck]], [[Severtzov's grouse]], and [[brown-winged parrotbill]]; the [[Ward's trogon]], [[black-necked crane]] and [[Verreaux's monal-partridge]].

'''''Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours''''' is a reference book about [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of [[wine grape]]s. The book covers all grape varieties that were known to produce commercial quantities of [[wine]] at the time of writing, which meant 1,368 of the known 10,000 varieties. It is written by British [[Master of Wine|Masters of Wine]] [[Jancis Robinson]] and Julia Harding in collaboration with Swiss grape [[geneticist]] Dr. José Vouillamoz.&lt;ref name="Decanter"&gt;Richard Woodard ''"[http://www.decanter.com/news/wine-news/530331/wine-grape-bible-poised-for-publication Wine grape 'bible' poised for publication]"'' ''Decanter'' August 17th, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Wine Grapes'' is not an update of Robinson's earlier book ''Vines, Grapes &amp; Wines'', first published in 1986. ''Wine Grapes'' is a brand new and original work that is much more extensive in coverage, and also incorporates recent findings from [[ampelography|ampelographic]] research, including [[DNA profiling]] of [[grape]] varieties.&lt;ref name="Financial Times"&gt;Jancis Robinson ''"[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a9c6ef26-cc33-11e1-839a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Ar5ulIst The Great Grapevine]"'' ''The Financial Times'' October 12th, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

''Wine Grapes'' include a catalog listing of 1,368 [[grape varieties]] from across the globe including 377 [[Italian wine|Italian]], 204 [[French wine|French]] and 77 [[Portuguese wine]] grape varieties. Coverage includes a listing of [[synonyms]] as well as the genetic relationship between varieties derived from DNA analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fiona Beckett]] ''"[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/19/grape-varieties-jancis-robinson-wine?newsfeed=true Wine: from abbuoto to zweigelt]"'' ''The Guardian'' October 19th, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA findings===
[[File:Petit Manseng.jpg|left|thumb|Sample of one of the colour plates from Viala et Vermorel that are included in the book ''Wine Grapes'', that details the extensive family tree of the Pinot grape including the lineage of Petit Manseng ''(pictured)'' to Savagnin blanc and Pinot noir.]]
According to Jancis Robinson and José Vouillamoz, ''Wine Grapes'' includes details about almost 300 previously unpublished relationship between different grape varieties including the extensive family tree of the [[Pinot (grape)|Pinot]] grape that includes a genetic link between the [[Burgundy wine|Burgundian wine]] grape [[Pinot noir]] to the [[Rhône (wine)|Rhône]] grape [[Syrah]] and the [[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]] varieties [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Cabernet franc]], [[Merlot]] and [[Malbec]]. The book also details how the [[Jura wine]] grape [[Savagnin blanc]] descended from the Pinot grape to go on and be the parent vine of several white wine varieties including [[Chenin blanc]], [[Grüner Veltliner]], [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Petit Manseng]] and [[Verdelho]].&lt;ref name="Financial Times"/&gt;

Along with research assistant and Master of wine Julia Harding, Robinson and Vouillamoz go on to detail the long history of discovering the parentage of the [[American wine]] variety [[Zinfandel]] including past research that pointed to a connection between the Italian variety  Primitivo and the [[Croatian wine]] grape Crljenak Kaštelanski. After years of research and DNA testing of vines from vineyards across the globe, a single 90-year-old grape vine from the garden of an elderly lady in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Croatia]] provided the evidence to show that Zinfandel was originally a Croatian grape known as ''Tribidrag'' that had been cultivated in Croatia since the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Financial Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Nenad Malenica, Silvio Šimon, Višnja Besendorfer, Edi Maletić, Jasminka Karoglan Kontić, Ivan Pejić  ''"[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225648907_Whole_genome_amplification_and_microsatellite_genotyping_of_herbarium_DNA_revealed_the_identity_of_an_ancient_grapevine_cultivar Whole genome amplification and microsatellite genotyping of herbarium DNA revealed the identity of an ancient grapevine cultivar]"'' ''Naturwissenschaften'' April, 2012 issue &lt;/ref&gt;

Other findings reported in ''Wine Grapes'' include the discovery of several species of [[Malvasia]] grapes growing in central and southern Italy are actually the [[Spanish wine]] grape [[Tempranillo]] and that Cabernet franc may have originated in [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque country]] of Spain. Additionally the origins of the assumed to be French varieties of [[Mourvèdre]], [[Grenache]] and [[Carignan]] are shown to likely be Spanish instead.&lt;ref name="Financial Times" /&gt;

Another detail revealed by DNA testing and reported in ''Wine Grapes'' is that several northern Italian white wine grape varieties including [[Favorita (grape)|Favorita]], [[Pigato]] and [[Vermentino]] are genetically the same grape vine which is known under the synonym of ''Rolle'' in France but has no genetic relationship to the [[Rollo]] grape of [[Liguria (wine)|Liguria]].&lt;ref name="Financial Times"/&gt;

==Colour plates==
A number of grape varieties are illustrated by reproductions of colour plates from ''[[Ampélographie. Traité général de viticulture]]'' written by [[Pierre Viala]] and [[Victor Vermorel]] and published in 1901–1910.&lt;ref name="Decanter"/&gt;
