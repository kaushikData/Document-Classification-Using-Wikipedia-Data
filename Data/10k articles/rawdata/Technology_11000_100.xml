'''Algae fuel''', '''algal biofuel''', or '''algal oil''' is an [[Alternative fuel|alternative to liquid fossil fuels]] that uses [[algae]] as its source of energy-rich oils. Also, algae fuels are an alternative to commonly known biofuel sources, such as corn and sugarcane.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.copbio.2010.03.005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Scott | first1 = S.

The energy crisis and the [[world food crisis]] have ignited interest in [[algaculture]] (farming algae) for making [[biodiesel]] and other [[biofuel]]s using land unsuitable for agriculture.

==History==
In 1942 Harder and Von Witsch were the first to propose that [[microalgae]] be grown as a source of lipids for food or fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harder | first1 = R. | last2 = von Witsch | first2 = H. | year = 1942 | title = Bericht über versuche zur fettsynthese mittels autotropher microorganismen | url = | journal = Forschungsdienst Sonderheft | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 270–275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harder | first1 = R. | last2 = von Witsch | first2 = H. | year = 1942 | title = Die massenkultur von diatomeen | url = | journal = Berichte der Deutschen Botanischen Gesellschaft | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 146–152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following World War II, research began in the US,&lt;ref&gt;Cook P.M. 1950.

Interest in the application of algae for biofuels was rekindled during the oil embargo and oil price surges of the 1970s, leading the US Department of Energy to initiate the [[Aquatic Species Program]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="AlgalBiofuelsRoadmap"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www1.eere.energy.gov/bioenergy/pdfs/algal_biofuels_roadmap.pdf |format=PDF|title = National Algal Biofuels Technology Roadmap |publisher = US Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Biomass Program | accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aquatic Species Program spent $25 million over 18 years with the goal of developing liquid transportation fuel from algae that would be price competitive with petroleum-derived fuels.&lt;ref name="Sheehan J. 1998. p. 1"&gt;Sheehan J., T. Dunahay, J. Benemann, P. Roessler. 1998. A look back at the U.S. Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program – biodiesel from algae. National Renewable Energy Laboratory: Golden, Colorado. NREL/TP-580-24190, p. 1–328.&lt;/ref&gt; The research program focused on the cultivation of microalgae in open outdoor ponds, systems which are low in cost but vulnerable to environmental disturbances like temperature swings and biological invasions. 3,000 algal strains were collected from around the country and screened for desirable properties such as high productivity, lipid content, and thermal tolerance, and the most promising strains were included in the SERI microalgae collection at the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory#History|Solar Energy Research Institute]] (SERI) in Golden, Colorado and used for further research.&lt;ref name="Sheehan J. 1998. p. 1"/&gt; Among the program's most significant findings were that rapid growth and high lipid production were "mutually exclusive", since the former required high nutrients and the latter required low nutrients.&lt;ref name="Sheehan J. 1998. p. 1"/&gt; The final report suggested that [[genetic engineering]] may be necessary to be able to overcome this and other natural limitations of algal strains, and that the ideal species might vary with place and season.&lt;ref name="Sheehan J. 1998. p. 1"/&gt; Although it was successfully demonstrated that large-scale production of algae for fuel in outdoor ponds was feasible, the program failed to do so at a cost that would be competitive with petroleum, especially as oil prices sank in the 1990s. Even in the best case scenario, it was estimated that unextracted algal oil would cost $59–186 per barrel,&lt;ref name="Sheehan J. 1998. p. 1"/&gt; while petroleum cost less than $20 per barrel in 1995.&lt;ref name="AlgalBiofuelsRoadmap"/&gt; Therefore, under budget pressure in 1996, the Aquatic Species Program was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Sheehan J. 1998. p. 1"/&gt;

Other contributions to algal biofuels research have come indirectly from projects focusing on different applications of algal cultures. For example, in the 1990s Japan's Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE) implemented a research program with the goal of developing systems to fix {{chem|CO|2}} using microalgae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0196-8904(95)00102-J| title = Biological CO2 fixation and utilization project| journal = Energy Conversion and Management| volume = 36| issue = 6–9| pages = 701–705| year = 1995| last1 = Michiki | first1 = H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the goal was not energy production, several studies produced by RITE demonstrated that algae could be grown using flue gas from power plants as a {{chem|CO|2}} source,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02922657| pmid = 1929389| title = Growth of Microalgae in High CO2 Gas and Effects of SOX and NOX| journal = Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology| volume = 28–29| pages = 877–86| year = 1991| last1 = Negoro | first1 = M. | last2 = Shioji | first2 = N. | last3 = Miyamoto | first3 = K. | last4 = Micira | first4 = Y. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02920589| title = Growth characteristics of microalgae in high-concentration co2 gas, effects of culture medium trace components, and impurities thereon| journal = Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology| volume = 34–35| pages = 681–692| year = 1992| last1 = Negoro | first1 = M. | last2 = Shioji | first2 = N. | last3 = Ikuta | first3 = Y. | last4 = Makita | first4 = T. | last5 = Uchiumi | first5 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; an important development for algal biofuel research. Other work focusing on harvesting hydrogen gas, methane, or ethanol from algae, as well as nutritional supplements and pharmaceutical compounds, has also helped inform research on biofuel production from algae.&lt;ref name="doi10.1007/978-94-007-5479-9_1"/&gt;

Following the disbanding of the Aquatic Species Program in 1996, there was a relative lull in algal biofuel research. Still, various projects were funded in the US by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[National Science Foundation]], [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|National Laboratories]], state funding, and private funding, as well as in other countries.&lt;ref name="AlgalBiofuelsRoadmap"/&gt; More recently, rising oil prices in the 2000s spurred a revival of interest in algal biofuels and US federal funding has increased,&lt;ref name="AlgalBiofuelsRoadmap"/&gt; numerous research projects are being funded in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, the Middle East, and other parts of the world,&lt;ref name="Pienko, P.T. 2009"/&gt; and a wave of private companies has entered the field&lt;ref&gt;Darzins, A., 2008. Recent and current research &amp; roadmapping activities: overview. National Algal Biofuels Technology Roadmap Workshop, University of Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Algae fuel#Companies|Companies]]). In November 2012, [[Solazyme]] and Propel Fuels made the first retail sales of algae-derived fuel,&lt;ref name="Erin Voegele"/&gt; and in March 2013 [[Sapphire Energy]] began commercial sales of algal biofuel to [[Tesoro]].&lt;ref name="Andrew Herndon"/&gt;

==Food supplementation==
Algal oil is used as a source of [[fatty acid]] [[dietary supplement|supplementation]] in food products, as it contains [[monounsaturated fat|mono-]] and [[polyunsaturated fat]]s, in particular [[eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Scott D.

==Fuels==
Algae can be converted into various types of fuels, depending on the technique and the part of the cells used. The [[lipid]], or oily part of the algae biomass can be extracted and converted into biodiesel through a process similar to that used for any other vegetable oil, or converted in a refinery into "drop-in" replacements for petroleum-based fuels. Alternatively or following lipid extraction, the [[carbohydrate]] content of algae can be fermented into [[bioethanol]] or [[butanol fuel]].&lt;ref name="merinews"&gt;{{cite web

===Biodiesel===
{{Main|Biodiesel}}
Biodiesel is a diesel fuel derived from animal or plant lipids (oils and fats). Studies have shown that some species of algae can produce 60% or more of their dry weight in the form of oil.&lt;ref name="doi10.1007/BF00410827"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheehan J. 1998. p. 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tornabene, 1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chisti, Y. 2007, pp. 294"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Anirban |last=Banerjee |first2=Rohit |last2=Sharma |first3=Yusuf |last3=Chisti |first4=U.

This oil can then be turned into [[biodiesel]] which could be sold for use in automobiles. Regional production of microalgae and processing into biofuels will provide economic benefits to rural communities.&lt;ref name="SARDI AQUATIC SCIENCES"&gt;

As they do not have to produce structural compounds such as cellulose for leaves, stems, or roots, and because they can be grown floating in a rich nutritional medium, microalgae can have faster growth rates than terrestrial crops. Also, they can convert a much higher fraction of their biomass to oil than conventional crops, e.g. 60% versus 2-3% for soybeans.&lt;ref name="Tornabene, 1983"&gt;Tornabene, et al (1983), Lipid composition of nitrogen starved, green [[Neochloris oleoabundans]]&lt;/ref&gt; The per unit area yield of oil from algae is estimated to be from 58,700 to 136,900 L/ha/year, depending on lipid content, which is 10 to 23 times as high as the next highest yielding crop, oil palm, at 5 950 L/ha/year.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.003"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.003| title = A comprehensive review on biodiesel as an alternative energy resource and its characteristics| journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews| volume = 16| issue = 4| pages = 2070–2093| year = 2012| last1 = Atabani | first1 = A.

[[Aquatic Species Program|The U.S. Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program]], 1978–1996, focused on biodiesel from microalgae. The final report suggested that [[biodiesel]] could be the only viable method by which to produce enough fuel to replace current world diesel usage.&lt;ref name="BiodieselFromAlgae"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/biodiesel_from_algae.pdf |format=PDF |title=Biodiesel Production from Algae |publisher=Department of Energy [[Aquatic Species Program]], National Renewable Energy Laboratory |accessdate=29 August 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926045050/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/biodiesel_from_algae.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; If algae-derived biodiesel were to replace the annual global production of 1.1bn tons of conventional diesel then a land mass of 57.3 million hectares would be required, which would be highly favorable compared to other biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shirvani | first1 = T. | last2 = Yan | first2 = X. | last3 = Inderwildi | first3 = O.

===Biobutanol===
{{Main|Butanol fuel}}
Butanol can be made from [[algae]] or [[diatom]]s using only a solar powered [[biorefinery]]. This fuel has an [[energy density]] 10% less than gasoline, and greater than that of either [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] or [[methanol fuel|methanol]]. In most gasoline engines, butanol can be used in place of gasoline with no modifications. In several tests, butanol consumption is similar to that of gasoline, and when blended with gasoline, provides better performance and corrosion resistance than that of ethanol or [[E85]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caaac/mstrs/March2007/Wolf.pdf Wolf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030023008/http://www.epa.gov/air/caaac/mstrs/March2007/Wolf.pdf |date=30 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The green waste left over from the algae oil extraction can be used to produce butanol. In addition, it has been shown that macroalgae (seaweeds) can be fermented by bacteria of genus ''[[Clostridia]]'' to butanol and other solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Potts | first1 = T. | last2 = Du | first2 = J. | last3 = Paul | first3 = M. | last4 = May | first4 = P. | last5 = Beitle | first5 = R. | last6 = Hestekin | first6 = J. | year = 2012 | title = The Production of Butanol from Jamaica Bay Macro Algae | url = | journal = Environmental Progress and Sustainable Energy | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 29–36 | doi=10.1002/ep.10606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogasoline===
[[Biogasoline]] is gasoline produced from [[biomass]]. Like traditionally produced gasoline, it contains between 6 ([[hexane]]) and 12 ([[dodecane]]) carbon atoms per molecule and can be used in [[internal-combustion engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/anie.201308143| title = Hydrodeoxygenation of the Angelica Lactone Dimer, a Cellulose-Based Feedstock: Simple, High-Yield Synthesis of Branched C7-C10Gasoline-like Hydrocarbons| journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition| volume = 53| issue = 7| pages = 1854–1857| year = 2014| last1 = Mascal | first1 = M. | last2 = Dutta | first2 = S. | last3 = Gandarias | first3 = I. | pmid=24474249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethanol===
The [[Algenol]] system which is being commercialized by [[BioFields (Renewable and Sustainable Energy)|BioFields]] in [[Puerto Libertad (Sonora)|Puerto Libertad]], [[Sonora]], Mexico utilizes seawater and industrial exhaust to produce ethanol. [[Porphyridium cruentum]] also have shown to be potentially suitable for ethanol production due to its capacity for accumulating large amount of carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of nitrogen on growth and carbohydrate formation in Porphyridium cruentum |date=2013-09-21 |doi=10.2478/s11535-013-0248-z |volume=9 |issue=2 |journal=Open Life Sciences | last1 = Razaghi | first1 = Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jet fuel===
{{Main|Aviation biofuel}}

Trials of using algae as biofuel were carried out by [[Lufthansa]], and [[Virgin Atlantic Airways|Virgin Airlines]] as early as 2008, although there is little evidence that using algae is a reasonable source for jet biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7261214.stm |publisher= BBC News |title= First biofuel flight touches down |accessdate=24 February 2008 | date=24 February 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080229004604/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7261214.stm| archivedate= 29 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, cultivation of [[fatty acid methyl ester]]s and [[alkenone]]s from the algae, ''Isochrysis'', was under research as a possible jet biofuel [[feedstock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Chris Reddy|author2=Greg O'Neil|title=Jet Fuel from Algae?

==Species==
Research into algae for the mass-production of oil focuses mainly on [[microalgae]] (organisms capable of photosynthesis that are less than 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, including the [[diatom]]s and [[cyanobacteria]]) as opposed to macroalgae, such as [[seaweed]]. The preference for microalgae has come about due largely to their less complex structure, fast growth rates, and high oil-content (for some species). However, some research is being done into using seaweeds for biofuels, probably due to the high availability of this resource.&lt;ref name="Times Online"&gt;

==Nutrients and growth inputs==
{{Main|Algaculture}}
Light is what algae primarily need for growth as it is the most limiting factor. Many companies are investing for developing systems and technologies for providing artificial light. One of them is OriginOil that has developed a Helix BioReactorTM that features a rotating vertical shaft with low-energy lights arranged in a helix pattern.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lawofalgae.wiki.zoho.com/Chapter-1----Introduction-to-Algae-Biofuels.html|title=Chapter 1 - Introduction to Algae Biofuels - Selecting Algae Species, Algae Production Issues, Harvesting Algae and Extracting Oil, and Converting Algae Oil to Biofuels|website=lawofalgae.wiki.zoho.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water temperature also influences the metabolic and reproductive rates of algae. Although most algae grow at low rate when the water temperature gets lower, the biomass of algal communities can get large due to the absence of grazing organisms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The modest increases in water current velocity may also affect rates of algae growth since the rate of nutrient uptake and boundary layer diffusion increases with current velocity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Other than light and water, phosphorus, nitrogen, and certain micronutrients are also useful and essential in growing algae. Nitrogen and phosphorus are the two most significant nutrients required for algal productivity, but other nutrients such as carbon and silica are additionally required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.krisweb.com/krissheepscot/krisdb/html/krisweb/stream/nutrients.htm|title=Nutrients and Algae|website=www.krisweb.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the nutrients required, phosphorus is one of the most essential ones as it is used in numerous metabolic processes. The microalgae ''D. tertiolecta'' was analyzed to see which nutrient affects its growth the most.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Meng|last2=Tang|first2=Haiying|last3=Ma|first3=Hongzhi|last4=Holland|first4=Thomas C.|last5=Ng|first5=K.

Among all these elements being measured, phosphorus resulted in the most dramatic decrease, with a reduction of 84% over the course of the culture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This result indicates that phosphorus, in the form of phosphate, is required in high amounts by all organisms for metabolism.

There are two enrichment media that have been extensively used to grow most species of algae: Walne medium and the Guillard's F/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; medium.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/W3732E/w3732e06.htm|title=2.3. Algal production|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These commercially available nutrient solutions may reduce time for preparing all the nutrients required to grow algae. However, due to their complexity in the process of generation and high cost, they are not used for large-scale culture operations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Therefore, enrichment media used for mass production of algae contain only the most important nutrients with agriculture-grade fertilizers rather than laboratory-grade fertilizers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Algae grow much faster than food crops, and can produce hundreds of times more oil per unit area than conventional crops such as rapeseed, palms, soybeans, or [[jatropha]].&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.003"/&gt; As algae have a harvesting cycle of 1–10 days, their cultivation permits several harvests in a very short time-frame, a strategy differing from that associated with annual crops.&lt;ref name="Chisti, Y. 2007, pp. 294"/&gt; In addition, algae can be grown on land unsuitable for terrestrial crops, including arid land and land with excessively saline soil, minimizing competition with agriculture.&lt;ref name="doi10.1007/s12155-008-9008-8"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s12155-008-9008-8| title = Second Generation Biofuels: High-Efficiency Microalgae for Biodiesel Production| journal = BioEnergy Research| volume = 1| pages = 20–43| year = 2008| last1 = Schenk | first1 = P.

===Closed-loop system===
The lack of equipment and structures needed to begin growing algae in large quantities has inhibited widespread mass-production of algae for biofuel production. Maximum use of existing agriculture processes and hardware is the goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/businesspolitics/will-algae-beat-its-competitors-to-become-the-king-source-of-biofuels/237 | title= Will algae beat its competitors to become the king source of biofuels? | author= 'Maryking' | date= 29 August 2007 | publisher= Environmental Graffiti | accessdate= 10 June 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101105155515/http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/businesspolitics/will-algae-beat-its-competitors-to-become-the-king-source-of-biofuels/237 | archive-date= 5 November 2010 | dead-url= yes | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closed systems (not exposed to open air) avoid the problem of contamination by other
organisms blown in by the air.  The problem for a closed system is finding a cheap source of sterile {{chem|CO|2}}.
Several experimenters have found the {{chem|CO|2}} from a smokestack works well for growing algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For reasons of economy, some experts think that algae farming for biofuels will have to be done as part of [[cogeneration]], where it can make use of waste heat and help soak up pollution.&lt;ref name="Worldwatch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pond"/&gt;

===Photobioreactors===
Most companies pursuing algae as a source of biofuels pump [[nutrient]]-rich water through plastic or borosilicate glass tubes (called "[[bioreactor]]s" ) that are exposed to sunlight (and so-called [[photobioreactor]]s or PBR).

Running a PBR is more difficult than using an open pond, and costlier, but may provide a higher level of control and productivity.&lt;ref name="Chisti, Y. 2007, pp. 294"/&gt;  In addition, a photobioreactor can be integrated into a closed loop cogeneration system much more easily than ponds or other methods.

===Open pond===
Open pond systems consist of simple in ground ponds, which are often mixed by a paddle wheel. These systems have low power requirements, operating costs, and capital costs when compared to closed loop photobioreactor systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1089/dst.2012.0013|title = Life Cycle Assessment for Microalgae Oil Production|journal = Disruptive Science and Technology|volume = 1|issue = 2|pages = 68–78|year = 2012|last1 = Benemann|first1 = John|last2 = Woertz|first2 = Ian|last3 = Lundquist|first3 = Tryg}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Nearly all commercial algae producers for high value algal products utilize open pond systems.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47654202_A_Realistic_Technology_and_Engineering_Assessment_of_Algae_Biofuel_Production&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turf scrubber===
[[File:ATSHydromentia.jpg|thumbnail|right|2.5 acre ATS system, installed by Hydromentia on a farm creek in Florida]]
The [[Algae scrubber]] is a system designed primarily for cleaning nutrients and pollutants out of water using algal turfs.  ATS mimics the algal turfs of a natural coral reef by taking in nutrient rich water from waste streams or natural water sources, and pulsing it over a sloped surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algalturfscrubber.com/|title=:: The Algal Turf Scrubber :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This surface is coated with a rough plastic membrane or a screen, which allows naturally occurring algal spores to settle and colonize the surface.  Once the algae has been established, it can be harvested every 5–15 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.physicsegypt.org/epc08/epc823.pdf | title=Algal Turf Scrubbers: Cleaning Water while Capturing Solar Energy for Bio fuel Production | date=2008 | accessdate=November 4, 2016 | author=Jeffrey Bannon, J.|author2=Adey, W. | pages=19–23 | conference=Proceedings of the Fourth Environmental Physics Conference (EPC'10)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can produce 18 metric tons of algal biomass per hectare per year.&lt;ref name="bioscience.oxfordjournals.org"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/6/434|title=Algal Turf Scrubbing: Cleaning Surface Waters with Solar Energy while Producing a Biofuel|first1=Walter H.|last1=Adey|first2=Patrick C.|last2=Kangas|first3=Walter|last3=Mulbry|date=1 June 2011|journal=BioScience|volume=61|issue=6|pages=434–441|via=bioscience.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.6.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to other methods, which focus primarily on a single high yielding species of algae, this method focuses on naturally occurring polycultures of algae.  As such, the lipid content of the algae in an ATS system is usually lower, which makes it more suitable for a fermented fuel product, such as ethanol, methane, or butanol.&lt;ref name="bioscience.oxfordjournals.org"/&gt;  Conversely, the harvested algae could be treated with a [[hydrothermal liquefaction]] process, which would make possible biodiesel, gasoline, and jet fuel production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-22314.pdf | title=Whole Algae Hydrothermal Liquefaction Technology Pathway | publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory | accessdate=November 4, 2016 | author=Mary Biddy |author2=Ryan Davis|author3=Susanne Jones|author4=Yunhua Zhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major advantages of ATS over other systems. The first advantage is documented higher productivity over open pond systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hydromentia.com/End-Products/NREL-Biodiesel-Algae-1998.pdf | title=A Look Back at the U.S. Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program: Biodiesel from Algae | publisher=U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Fuels Development | date=July 1998 | accessdate=November 4, 2016 | author=John Sheehan|author2=Terri Dunahay|author3=John Benemann|author4=Paul Roessler}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second is lower operating and fuel production costs.  The third is the elimination of contamination issues due to the reliance on naturally occurring algae species.  The projected costs for energy production in an ATS system are $0.75/kg, compared to a photobioreactor which would cost $3.50/kg.&lt;ref name="bioscience.oxfordjournals.org"/&gt;  Furthermore, due to the fact that the primary purpose of ATS is removing nutrients and pollutants out of water, and these costs have been shown to be lower than other methods of nutrient removal, this may incentivize the use of this technology for nutrient removal as the primary function, with biofuel production as an added benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydromentia.com/Products-Services/Algal-Turf-Scrubber/Features-Benefits/Cost-Effective.html|title=Cost Effective - Hydromentia : Hydromentia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Algae ATS harvest.jpg|thumb|Algae being harvested and dried from an ATS system]]

==Fuel production==
After harvesting the algae, the biomass is typically processed in a series of steps, which can differ based on the species and desired product; this is an active area of research&lt;ref name="Chisti, Y. 2007, pp. 294"/&gt; and also is the bottleneck of this technology: the cost of extraction is higher than those obtained. One of the solutions is to use filter feeders to "eat" them. Improved animals can provide both foods and fuels. An alternative method to extract the algae is to grow the algae with specific types of fungi. This causes bio-flocculation of the algae which allows for easier extraction.&lt;ref name="MackayGomes2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackay|first1=S.|last2=Gomes|first2=E.|last3=Holliger|first3=C.|last4=Bauer|first4=R.|last5=Schwitzguébel|first5=J.-P.|title=Harvesting of Chlorella sorokiniana by co-culture with the filamentous fungus Isaria fumosorosea: A potential sustainable feedstock for hydrothermal gasification|journal=Bioresource Technology|volume=185|year=2015|pages=353–361|issn=0960-8524|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2015.03.026|pmid=25795450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dehydration===
Often, the algae is dehydrated, and then a solvent such as hexane is used to extract energy-rich compounds like [[triglyceride]]s from the dried material.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.copbio.2010.03.005"/&gt; Then, the extracted compounds can be processed into fuel using standard industrial procedures. For example, the extracted triglycerides are reacted with methanol to create biodiesel via [[transesterification]].&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.copbio.2010.03.005"/&gt; The unique composition of fatty acids of each species influences the quality of the resulting biodiesel and thus must be taken into account when selecting algal species for feedstock.&lt;ref name="Chisti, Y. 2007, pp. 294"/&gt;

===Hydrothermal liquefaction===
An alternative approach called [[Hydrothermal liquefaction]] employs a continuous process that subjects harvested wet algae to high temperatures and pressures&amp;mdash;{{convert|350|C|F}} and {{convert|3000|psi}}.&lt;ref name=giz1312&gt;{{cite web

Products include crude oil, which can be further refined into aviation fuel, gasoline, or diesel fuel using one or many upgrading processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=Jerome|last2=Brown|first2=Richard|last3=Rainey|first3=Thomas|title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels|journal=Energies|date=1 July 2015|volume=8|issue=7|pages=6765–6794|doi=10.3390/en8076765|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/8/7/6765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test process converted between 50 and 70 percent of the algae's carbon into fuel. Other outputs include clean water, fuel gas and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.&lt;ref name=giz1312/&gt;

==Nutrients==
{{Main|Algal nutrient solutions}}
Nutrients like [[nitrogen]] (N), [[phosphorus]] (P), and [[potassium]] (K), are important for plant growth and are essential parts of fertilizer. [[Silica]] and iron, as well as several trace elements, may also be considered important marine nutrients as the lack of one can limit the growth of, or productivity in, an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Carbon dioxide===
Bubbling {{chem|CO|2}} through algal cultivation systems can greatly increase productivity and yield (up to a saturation point). Typically, about 1.8 tonnes of [[CO2|{{chem|CO|2}}]] will be utilised per tonne of algal biomass (dry) produced, though this varies with algae species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/accelerating-uptake-ccs-industrial-use-captured-carbon-dioxide/online/28426#c25|title=Accelerating the uptake of CCS: Industrial use of captured carbon dioxide|publisher=Global CCS Institute|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Glenturret Distillery in [[Perthshire]], UK – home to [[The Famous Grouse]] Whisky – percolate [[CO2|{{chem|CO|2}}]] made during the whisky distillation through a microalgae bioreactor. Each tonne of microalgae absorbs two tonnes of {{chem|CO|2}}. Scottish Bioenergy, who run the project, sell the microalgae as high value, protein-rich food for [[fishery|fisheries]]. In the future, they will use the algae residues to produce renewable energy through [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref name="Ecologist"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/other_comments/609556/forget_palm_oil_and_soya_microalgae_is_the_next_big_biofuel_source.html  | title= Forget palm oil and soya, microalgae is the next big biofuel source | last= Aylott | first= Matthew | date= September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nitrogen===
Nitrogen is a valuable substrate that can be utilized in algal growth. Various sources of nitrogen can be used as a nutrient for algae, with varying capacities. Nitrate was found to be the preferred source of nitrogen, in regards to amount of biomass grown. Urea is a readily available source that shows comparable results, making it an economical substitute for nitrogen source in large scale culturing of algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Arumugam | first1 = M. | last2 = Agarwal | first2 = A. | last3 = Arya | first3 = M.

In one study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moellering | first1 = E. R. | last2 = Benning | first2 = C. | doi = 10.1128/EC.00203-09 | title = RNA Interference Silencing of a Major Lipid Droplet Protein Affects Lipid Droplet Size in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii | journal = Eukaryotic Cell | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–106 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19915074| pmc =2805299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nitrogen deprivation for 72 hours caused the total fatty acid content (on a per cell basis) to increase by 2.4-fold. 65% of the total fatty acids were esterified to triacylglycerides in oil bodies, when compared to the initial culture, indicating that the algal cells utilized de novo synthesis of fatty acids. It is vital for the lipid content in algal cells to be of high enough quantity, while maintaining adequate cell division times, so parameters that can maximize both are under investigation.

===Wastewater===
{{Main|Wastewater treatment facility}}
A possible nutrient source is [[waste water]] from the treatment of sewage, agricultural, or flood plain run-off, all currently major pollutants and health risks. However, this waste water cannot feed algae directly and must first be processed by bacteria, through [[anaerobic digestion]]. If waste water is not processed before it reaches the algae, it will contaminate the algae in the reactor, and at the very least, kill much of the desired algae strain. In [[biogas]] facilities, organic waste is often converted to a mixture of carbon dioxide, [[methane]], and organic fertilizer. Organic fertilizer that comes out of the digester is liquid, and nearly suitable for algae growth, but it must first be cleaned and sterilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2010.06.035| pmid = 20594826| title = The potential of sustainable algal biofuel production using wastewater resources| journal = Bioresource Technology| volume = 102| issue = 1| pages = 17–25| year = 2011| last1 = Pittman | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Dean | first2 = A. P. | last3 = Osundeko | first3 = O. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The utilization of wastewater and ocean water instead of freshwater is strongly advocated due to the continuing depletion of freshwater resources. However, heavy metals, trace metals, and other contaminants in wastewater can decrease the ability of cells to produce lipids biosynthetically and also impact various other workings in the machinery of cells. The same is true for ocean water, but the contaminants are found in different concentrations. Thus, agricultural-grade fertilizer is the preferred source of nutrients, but heavy metals are again a problem, especially for strains of algae that are susceptible to these metals. In open pond systems the use of strains of algae that can deal with high concentrations of heavy metals could prevent other organisms from infesting these systems.&lt;ref name="doi10.1007/s12155-008-9008-8"/&gt; In some instances it has even been shown that strains of algae can remove over 90% of nickel and zinc from industrial wastewater in relatively short periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0045-6535(99)00418-X| pmid = 10819208| title = Performance of different microalgal species in removing nickel and zinc from industrial wastewater| journal = Chemosphere| volume = 41| issue = 1–2| pages = 251–7| year = 2000| last1 = Chong | first1 = A.

==Environmental impact==
In comparison with terrestrial-based biofuel crops such as corn or soybeans, microalgal production results in a much less significant land footprint due to the higher oil productivity from the microalgae than all other oil crops.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = V.

In addition, algal biofuels are much less toxic, and degrade far more readily than petroleum-based fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oem/docs/oil/fss/fss09/hollebonebiofuels.pdf|title=Emergency Response|first=US|last=EPA, OSWER, OEM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/sids/sids/71363.pdf | title=n-Butyl Alcohol  CAS N°: 71-36-3 | publisher=OECD SIDS | date=November 9, 2001 | accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethanolrfa.org/pages/ethanol-facts-environment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523101843/http://www.ethanolrfa.org/pages/ethanol-facts-environment |archivedate=23 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, due to the flammable nature of any combustible fuel, there is potential for some environmental hazards if ignited or spilled, as may occur in a train derailment or a pipeline leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mass.gov/eopss/docs/dfs/emergencyresponse/special-ops/ethanol-spill-impacts-and-response-7-11.pdf | title=Large Volume Ethanol Spills – Environmental Impacts and Response Options | date=July 2011 | accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This hazard is reduced compared to fossil fuels, due to the ability for algal biofuels to be produced in a much more localized manner, and due to the lower toxicity overall, but the hazard is still there nonetheless.  Therefore, algal biofuels should be treated in a similar manner to petroleum fuels in transportation and use, with sufficient safety measures in place at all times.

Studies have determined that replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, such as biofuels, have the capability of reducing {{chem|CO|2}} emissions by up to 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Acién Fernández | first1 = F.

Furthermore, compared to fuels like diesel and petroleum, and even compared to other sources of biofuels, the production and combustion of algal biofuel does not produce any sulfur oxides or nitrous oxides, and produces a reduced amount of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and reduced emission of other harmful pollutants.&lt;ref name="Hemaiswarya, S. 1135"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hemaiswarya | first1 = S. | last2 = Raja | first2 = R. | last3 = Carvalho | first3 = I.

Microalgae production also includes the ability to use saline waste or waste {{chem|CO|2}} streams as an energy source.  This opens a new strategy to produce biofuel in conjunction with waste water treatment, while being able to produce clean water as a byproduct.&lt;ref name="Hemaiswarya, S. 1135"/&gt;  When used in a microalgal bioreactor, harvested microalgae will capture significant quantities of organic compounds as well as heavy metal contaminants absorbed from wastewater streams that would otherwise be directly discharged into surface and ground-water.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Moreover, this process also allows the recovery of phosphorus from waste, which is an essential but scarce element in nature – the reserves of which are estimated to have depleted in the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kumar | first1 = A. | last2 = Ergas | first2 = S. | last3 = Yuan | first3 = X. | last4 = Sahu | first4 = A. | last5 = Zhang | first5 = Q. | last6 = Dewulf | first6 = J. | last7 = Malcata | first7 = F.

===Polycultures===
Nearly all research in algal biofuels has focused on culturing single species, or monocultures, of microalgae. However, ecological theory and empirical studies have demonstrated that plant and algae polycultures, i.e. groups of multiple species, tend to produce larger yields than monocultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Downing | first1 = A.

==Economic viability==
There is clearly a demand for sustainable biofuel production, but whether a particular biofuel will be used ultimately depends not on sustainability but cost efficiency. Therefore, research is focusing on cutting the cost of algal biofuel production to the point where it can compete with conventional petroleum.&lt;ref name="Chisti, Y. 2007, pp. 294"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tipsstephens"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stephens |first=E. |last2=Ross |first2=I.L. |last3=Mussgnug |first3=J.H. |last4=Wagner |first4=L.D. |last5=Borowitzka |first5=M.A. |last6=Posten|first6=C. |last7=Kruse |first7=O. |last8=Hankamer |first8=B. |date=October 2010 |title=Future prospects of microalgal biofuel production systems |journal=Trends in Plant Science |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=554–564 |url=http://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/abstract/S1360-1385(10)00149-4?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1360138510001494%3Fshowall%3Dtrue |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2010.06.003|pmid=20655798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of several products from algae has been mentioned{{weasel inline|date=August 2015}} as the most important factor for making algae production economically viable.

Whereas technical problems, such as harvesting, are being addressed successfully by the industry, the high up-front investment of algae-to-biofuels facilities is seen by many as a major obstacle to the success of this technology. Only few studies on the economic viability are publicly available, and must often rely on the little data (often only engineering estimates) available in the public domain.

Raceways might be cost-effective in warm climates with very low labor costs, and fermenters may become cost-effective subsequent to significant process improvements.

==Use of Byproducts==
Many of the byproducts produced in the processing of microalgae can be used in various applications, many of which have a longer history of production than algal biofuel. Some of the products not used in the production of biofuel include natural dyes and pigments, antioxidants, and other high-value bio-active compounds.&lt;ref name="Mata, T.M. 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mata | first1 = T.

(ed.). Spirulina platensis (Arthrospira): Physiology, Cell-biology and Biotechnology. London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

===Ease of growth===
One of the main advantages that using microalgae as the feedstock when compared to more traditional crops is that it can be grown much more easily.&lt;ref name="Demirbas, A. 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Demirbas | first1 = A. | last2 = Fatih Demirbas | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/j.enconman.2010.06.055 | title = Importance of algae oil as a source of biodiesel | journal = Energy Conversion and Management | volume = 52 | pages = 163–170 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae can be grown in land that would not be considered suitable for the growth of the regularly used crops.&lt;ref name="Mata, T.M. 2009"/&gt; In addition to this, wastewater that would normally hinder plant growth has been shown to be very effective in growing algae.&lt;ref name="Demirbas, A. 2011"/&gt; Because of this, algae can be grown without taking up arable land that would otherwise be used for producing food crops, and the better resources can be reserved for normal crop production. Microalgae also require fewer resources to grow and little attention is needed, allowing the growth and cultivation of algae to be a very passive process.&lt;ref name="Mata, T.M. 2009"/&gt;

===Impact on food===
Many traditional feedstocks for biodiesel, such as corn and palm, are also used as feed for livestock on farms, as well as a valuable source of food for humans. Because of this, using them as biofuel reduces the amount of food available for both, resulting in an increased cost for both the food and the fuel produced. Using algae as a source of biodiesel can alleviate this problem in a number of ways. First, algae is not used as a primary food source for humans, meaning that it can be used solely for fuel and there would be little impact in the food industry.&lt;ref name="Vasudevan, P.T. 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vasudevan | first1 = P. T. | last2 = Briggs | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1007/s10295-008-0312-2 | title = Biodiesel production—current state of the art and challenges | journal = Journal of Industrial Microbiology &amp; Biotechnology | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 421–430 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18205018| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, many of the waste-product extracts produced during the processing of algae for biofuel can be used as a sufficient animal feed. This is an effective way to minimize waste and a much cheaper alternative to the more traditional corn- or grain-based feeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Demirbaş | first1 = A. | title = Production of Biodiesel from Algae Oils | doi = 10.1080/15567030701521775 | journal = Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization, and Environmental Effects | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 163–168 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimalisation of waste===
Growing algae as a source of biofuel has also been shown to have numerous environmental benefits, and has presented itself as a much more environmentally friendly alternative to current biofuels. For one, it is able to utilize run-off, water contaminated with fertilizers and other nutrients that are a by-product of farming, as its primary source of water and nutrients.&lt;ref name="Demirbas, A. 2011"/&gt; Because of this, it prevents this contaminated water from mixing with the lakes and rivers that currently supply our drinking water. In addition to this, the ammonia, nitrates, and phosphates that would normally render the water unsafe actually serve as excellent nutrients for the algae, meaning that fewer resources are needed to grow the algae.&lt;ref name="Mata, T.M. 2009"/&gt; Many algae species used in biodiesel production are excellent bio-fixers, meaning they are able to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to use as a form of energy for themselves. Because of this, they have found use in industry as a way to treat flue gases and reduce GHG emissions.&lt;ref name="Mata, T.M. 2009"/&gt;

==Disadvantages==

===Commercial Viability===
Algae biodiesel is still a fairly new technology. Despite the fact that research began over 30 years ago, it was put on hold during the mid-1990s, mainly due to a lack of funding and a relatively low petroleum cost.&lt;ref name="Pienko, P.T. 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pienkos | first1 = P. T. | last2 = Darzins | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1002/bbb.159 | title = The promise and challenges of microalgal-derived biofuels | journal = Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 431–440 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next few years algae biofuels saw little attention; it was not until the gas peak of the early 2000s that it eventually had a revitalization in the search for alternative fuel sources.&lt;ref name="Pienko, P.T. 2009"/&gt; While the technology exists to harvest and convert algae into a usable source of biodiesel, it still hasn't been implemented into a large enough scale to support the current energy needs. Further research will be required to make the production of algae biofuels more efficient, and at this point it is currently being held back by lobbyists in support of alternative biofuels, like those produced from corn and grain.&lt;ref name="Pienko, P.T. 2009"/&gt; In 2013, [[Exxon Mobil]] Chairman and CEO [[Rex Tillerson]] said that after originally committing to spending up to $600 million on development in a joint venture with [[J. Craig Venter]]'s [[Synthetic Genomics]], algae is "probably further" than "25 years away" from commercial viability,&lt;ref name="Tillerson"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-08/exxon-at-least-25-years-away-from-making-fuel-from-algae.html "Exxon at Least 25 Years Away From Making Fuel From Algae"] ''Bloomberg'', 8 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Solazyme]]&lt;ref name="Erin Voegele"/&gt; and [[Sapphire Energy]]&lt;ref name="Andrew Herndon"/&gt; already began small-scale commercial sales in 2012 and 2013, respectively. By 2017, most efforts had been abandoned or changed to other applications, with only a few remaining.&lt;ref name="Eric Wesoff"/&gt;

===Stability===
The biodiesel produced from the processing of microalgae differs from other forms of biodiesel in the content of polyunsaturated fats.&lt;ref name="Demirbas, A. 2011"/&gt; Polyunsaturated fats are known for their ability to retain fluidity at lower temperatures. While this may seem like an advantage in production during the colder temperatures of the winter, the polyunsaturated fats result in lower stability during regular seasonal temperatures.&lt;ref name="Vasudevan, P.T. 2008"/&gt;

===Genetic engineering===
[[Genetic engineering]] algae has been used to increase lipid production or growth rates. Current research in genetic engineering includes either the introduction or removal of [[enzyme]]s. In 2007 Oswald et al. introduced a [[monoterpene synthase]] from sweet [[basil]] into [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]], a strain of [[yeast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular monoterpene synthase causes the de novo synthesis of large amounts of [[geraniol]], while also secreting it into the medium. Geraniol is a primary component in [[rose oil]], [[palmarosa oil]], and [[citronella oil]] as well as essential oils, making it a viable source of [[triacylglyceride]]s for biodiesel production.&lt;ref&gt;Geraniol, The Merck Index, 12th Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The enzyme [[ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase]] is vital in starch production, but has no connection to lipid synthesis. Removal of this enzyme resulted in the sta6 mutant, which showed increased lipid content. After 18 hours of growth in nitrogen deficient medium the sta6 mutants had on average 17&amp;nbsp;ng triacylglycerides/1000 cells, compared to 10&amp;nbsp;ng/1000 cells in WT cells. This increase in lipid production was attributed to reallocation of intracellular resources, as the algae diverted energy from starch production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Z.

===Funding programs===
Numerous Funding programs have been created with aims of promoting the use of Renewable Energy. In Canada, the ecoAgriculture biofuels capital initiative (ecoABC) provides $25 million per project to assist farmers in constructing and expanding a renewable fuel production facility. The program has $186 million set aside for these projects. The sustainable development (SDTC) program has also applied $500 millions over 8 years to assist with the construction of next-generation renewable fuels. In addition, over the last 2 years $10 million has been made available for renewable fuel research and analysis&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

In Europe, the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) is the main instrument for funding research. Similarly, the NER 300 is an unofficial, independent portal dedicated to renewable energy and grid integration projects. Another program includes the [[Horizon 2020]] program which will start 1 January, and will bring together the framework program and other EC innovation and research funding into a new integrated funding system&lt;ref name="biofuelstp.eu"/&gt;

The American [[National Biodiesel Board|NBB]]'s [[Biodiesel in the United States#Feedstock development|Feedstock Development program]] is addressing production of algae on the horizon to expand available material for biodiesel in a sustainable manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiesel.org/resources/sustainability/pdfs/Food%20and%20FuelApril162008.pdf|title=404 Error - Biodiesel.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International policies==

===Canada===
Numerous policies have been put in place since the 1975 oil crisis in order to promote the use of Renewable Fuels in the United States, Canada and Europe. In Canada, these included the implementation of excise taxes exempting propane and natural gas which was extended to ethanol made from biomass and methanol in 1992. The federal government also announced their renewable fuels strategy in 2006 which proposed four components: increasing availability of renewable fuels through regulation, supporting the expansion of Canadian production of renewable fuels, assisting farmers to seize new opportunities in this sector and accelerating the commercialization of new technologies. These mandates were quickly followed by the Canadian provinces:

BC introduced a 5% ethanol and 5% renewable diesel requirement which was effective by January 2010. It also introduced a low carbon fuel requirement for 2012 to 2020.

Alberta introduced a 5% ethanol and 2% renewable diesel requirement implemented April 2011. The province also introduced a minimum 25% GHG emission reduction requirement for qualifying renewable fuels.

Saskatchewan implemented a 2% renewable diesel requirement in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor Don, Canadian Energy Legislation. Canadian Biofuel Policies. (S&amp;T) 2 Consultants Inc June, 2011, pp. 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in 2006, the Canadian Federal Government announced its commitment to using its purchasing power to encourage the biofuel industry. Section three of the 2006 alternative fuels act stated that when it is economically feasible to do so-75% per cent of all federal bodies and crown corporation will be motor vehicles.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gao | first1 = Y. | last2 = Gregor | first2 = C. | last3 = Liang | first3 = Y. | last4 = Tang | first4 = D. | last5 = Tweed | first5 = C. | title = Algae biodiesel - a feasibility report | doi = 10.1186/1752-153X-6-S1-S1 | journal = Chemistry Central Journal | volume = 6 | pages = S1 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22540986| pmc = 3332261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council of Canada]] has established research on Algal Carbon Conversion as one of its flagship programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/collaborative/algal_index.html |title=Algal Carbon Conversion Flagship - National Research Council Canada |publisher=Nrc-cnrc.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this program, the NRC made an announcement in May 2013 that they are partnering with Canadian Natural Resources Limited and Pond Biofuels to construct a demonstration-scale algal biorefinery near Bonnyville, Alberta.&lt;ref name="nrc-cnrc1"/&gt;

===United States===
Policies in the United States have included a decrease in the subsidies provided by the federal and state governments to the oil industry which have usually included $2.84 billion. This is more than what is actually set aside for the biofuel industry. The measure was discussed at the G20 in Pittsburgh where leaders agreed that "inefficient fossil fuel subsidies encourage wasteful consumption, reduce our energy security, impede investment in clean sources and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change". If this commitment is followed through and subsidies are removed, a fairer market in which algae biofuels can compete will be created. In 2010, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a legislation seeking to give algae-based biofuels parity with cellulose biofuels in federal tax credit programs. The algae-based renewable fuel promotion act (HR 4168) was implemented to give biofuel projects access to a $1.01 per gal production tax credit and 50% bonus depreciation for biofuel plant property. The U.S Government also introduced the domestic Fuel for Enhancing National Security Act implemented in 2011. This policy constitutes an amendment to the Federal property and administrative services act of 1949 and federal defense provisions in order to extend to 15 the number of years that the Department of Defense (DOD) multiyear contract may be entered into the case of the purchase of advanced biofuel. Federal and DOD programs are usually limited to a 5-year period&lt;ref&gt;G20.

===Other===
The European Union (EU) has also responded by quadrupling the credits for second-generation algae biofuels which was established as an amendment to the Biofuels and Fuel Quality Directives&lt;ref name="biofuelstp.eu"&gt;[http://www.biofuelstp.eu/funding.html European biofuels technology platform.

==Companies==
{{See also|List of algal fuel producers}}
With algal biofuel being a relatively new alternative to conventional petroleum products, it leaves numerous opportunities for drastic advances in all aspects of the technology. Producing algae biofuel is not yet a cost-effective replacement for gasoline, but alterations to current methodologies can change this. The two most common targets for advancements are the growth medium (open pond vs. photobioreactor) and methods to remove the intracellular components of the algae. Below are companies that are currently innovating algal biofuel technologies.

===Algenol Biofuels===
Founded in 2006, Algenol Biofuels is a global, industrial biotechnology company that is commercializing its patented algae technology for production of ethanol and other fuels.  Based in Southwest Florida, Algenol's patented technology enables the production of the four most important fuels (ethanol, gasoline, jet, and diesel fuel) using proprietary algae, sunlight, carbon dioxide and saltwater for around $1.27 per gallon and at production levels of 8 000 total gallons of liquid fuel per acre per year. Algenol's technology produces high yields and relies on patented photobioreactors and proprietary downstream techniques for low-cost fuel production using carbon dioxide from industrial sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://algenol.com/ |title=About Algenol &amp;#124; Algenol Biofuels |publisher=Algenol.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company originally intended on producing commercially by 2014, but was set back when Florida Governor Rick Scott signed a bill in 2013 eliminating the state's mandate of a minimum of 10% ethanol in commercial gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc-2.com/story/22574373/algenol-governor-rick-scott-algae-ethanol-lee-county#.Ubsmf8u9KSM|title=Algenol kills plan to bring 2,000 jobs to SWFL|first=Dave|last=Elias|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused Algenol CEO Paul Woods to scrap a plan for a US $500 million plant to produce commercial amounts of algae biofuels and pursue other job sites. Currently, Algenol is a partner of the US Department of Energy's Bioenergy Technologies Office, and in 2015 began smaller-scale commercial sales of E15 and E85 ethanol blends to Protec Fuel, a Florida-based fuel distributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/articles/algenol-announces-commercial-algal-ethanol-fuel-partnership|title=Algenol Announces Commercial Algal Ethanol Fuel Partnership|website=Energy.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue Marble Production===
Blue Marble Production is a Seattle-based company that is dedicated to removing algae from algae-infested water. This in turn cleans up the environment and allows this company to produce biofuel. Rather than just focusing on the mass production of algae, this company focuses on what to do with the byproducts. This company recycles almost 100% of its water via reverse osmosis, saving about 26 000 gallons of water every month. This water is then pumped back into their system. The gas produced as a byproduct of algae will also be recycled by being placed into a photobioreactor system that holds multiple strains of algae. Whatever gas remains is then made into pyrolysis oil by thermochemical processes. Not only does this company seek to produce biofuel, but it also wishes to use algae for a variety of other purposes such as fertilizer, food flavoring, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sims|first=B|title=Blue marble, um partner to optimize algal biomass utilization|url=http://www.biorefiningmagazine.com/articles/6004/blue-marble-um-partner-to-optimize-algal-biomass-utilization|accessdate=13 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729231215/http://www.biorefiningmagazine.com/articles/6004/blue-marble-um-partner-to-optimize-algal-biomass-utilization|archivedate=29 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solazyme===
Solazyme is one of a handful of companies which is supported by oil companies such as Chevron. Additionally, this company is also backed by Imperium Renewables, Blue Crest Capital Finance, and The Roda Group. Solazyme has developed a way to use up to 80% percent of dry algae as oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nathan |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2013/04/10/breakthrough-in-microalgae-oil-production-accelerated-ability-to-produce-a-variety-of-different-oils/ |title=Breakthrough In Microalgae Oil Production, Accelerated Ability To Produce Variety Of Different Oils |publisher=CleanTechnica |date=2013-04-10 |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process requires the algae to grow in a dark fermentation vessel and be fed by carbon substrates within their growth media. The effect is the production of triglycerides that are almost identical to vegetable oil. Solazyme's production method is said to produce more oil than those algae cultivated photosynthetically or made to produce ethanol. Oil refineries can then take this algal oil and turn it into biodiesel, renewable diesel or jet fuels.

Part of Solazyme's testing, in collaboration with Maersk Line and the US Navy, placed 30 tons of Soladiesel(RD) algae fuel into the 98,000-tonne, 300-metre container ship Maersk Kalmar. This fuel was used at blends from 7% to 100% in an auxiliary engine on a month-long trip from Bremerhaven, Germany to Pipavav, India in Dec 2011. In Jul 2012, The US Navy used 700 000 gallons of HRD76 biodiesel in three ships of the USS Nimitz "Green Strike Group" during the 2012 RIMPAC exercise in Hawaii. The Nimitz also used 200 000 gallons of HRJ5 jet biofuel. The 50/50 biofuel blends were provided by Solazyme and Dynamic Fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fehrenbacher|first=K|title=15 Algae Startups Bringing Pond Scum to Fuel Tanks|url=http://gigaom.com/cleantech/15-algae-startups-bringing-pond-scum-to-fuel-tanks/|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Solazyme Integrated Biorefinery: Diesel Fuesl from Heterotrophic algae|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/ibr_arra_solazyme.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solzayme: Meeting the growing need for renewable fuels|url=http://solazyme.com/fuels|accessdate=13 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306143500/http://solazyme.com/fuels|archivedate=6 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversified Technologies Inc.===
Diversified Technologies Inc. has created a patent pending pre-treatment option to reduce costs of oil extraction from algae. This technology, called Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) technology, is a low cost, low energy process that applies high voltage electric pulses to a slurry of algae.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.divtecs.com Diversified Technology Inc.] (accessed 01/14/2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The electric pulses enable the algal cell walls to be ruptured easily, increasing the availability of all cell contents (Lipids, proteins and carbohydrates), allowing the separation into specific components downstream. This alternative method to intracellular extraction has shown the capability to be both integrated in-line as well as scalable into high yield assemblies. The Pulse Electric Field subjects the algae to short, intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation in a treatment chamber, electroporating the cell walls. The formation of holes in the cell wall allows the contents within to flow into the surrounding solution for further separation. PEF technology only requires 1-10 microsecond pulses, enabling a high-throughput approach to algal extraction.

Preliminary calculations have shown that utilization of PEF technology would only account for $0.10 per gallon of algae derived biofuel produced. In comparison, conventional drying and solvent-based extractions account for $1.75 per gallon. This inconsistency between costs can be attributed to the fact that algal drying generally accounts for 75% of the extraction process.&lt;ref&gt;Gieskes, Thomas E. Algae Oil Extraction (Powerpoint Presentation), Organic Fuels Holding, Inc., March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Although a relatively new technology, PEF has been successfully used in both food decomtamination processes as well as waste water treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Protection Agency: [http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract/5603 Wastewater Treatment by Pulsed Electric Field Processing].

In fact, ultraviolet irradiation is actually detrimental as it inhibits photosynthesis, photoreduction, and the 520&amp;nbsp;nm light-dark absorbance change of algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mantai | first1 = K. E. | last2 = Bishop | first2 = N.

This bioreactor also addresses another key issue in algal cell growth; introducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nutrients to the algae without disrupting or over-aerating the algae. Origin Oils Inc. combats this issues through the creation of their Quantum Fracturing technology. This process takes the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other nutrients, fractures them at extremely high pressures and then deliver the micron sized bubbles to the algae. This allows the nutrients to be delivered at a much lower pressure, maintaining the integrity of the cells.&lt;ref name="aquaticbiofuel.com"/&gt;

===Proviron===
Proviron is a Belgian microalgae company that also operates in the United States. The company has been working on a new type of reactor (using flat plates) which reduces the cost of algae cultivation. At [[AlgaePARC]] similar research is being conducted using 4 grow systems (1 open pond system and 3 types of closed systems). According to René Wijffels the current systems do not yet allow algae fuel to be produced competitively. However using new (closed) systems, and by scaling up the production it would be possible to reduce costs by 10X, up to a price of 0,4 € per kg of algae.&lt;ref&gt;EOS magazine, 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Proviron focuses primarily on alternative uses of algae cultures, such as environmentally-conscious plastics, esterification processes, and de-icing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proviron.be/|title=Home - Proviron|website=www.proviron.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genifuels===
Genifuel Corporation has licensed the high temperature/pressure fuel extraction process and has been working with the team at the lab since 2008. The company intends to team with some industrial partners to create a pilot plant using this process to make biofuel in industrial quantities.&lt;ref name=giz1312/&gt; Genifuel process combines hydrothermal liquefaction with catalytic hydrothermal gasification in reactor running at 350 Degrees Celsius (662 Degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure of 20 684.2719 kPa (3 000 PSI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pnnl.gov/news/release.aspx?id=1029|title=Algae to crude oil: Million-year natural process takes minutes in the lab|date=17 December 2013|publisher=PNNL|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Qeshm Microalgae Biorefinery Co. (QMAB) ===
QMAB is an Iran-based biofuels company operating solely on the Iranian island of Qeshm in the Strait of Hormuz. QMAB's original pilot plant has been operating since 2009, and has a 25,000 Litre capacity.&lt;ref name="algaeindustrymagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.algaeindustrymagazine.com/qmab-launches-baya-microalgal-biofuel/]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116103923/http://www.algaeindustrymagazine.com/qmab-launches-baya-microalgal-biofuel/ |date=16 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, QMAB released BAYA Biofuel, a biofuel deriving from the algae Nannochloropsis, and has since specified that its unique strain is up to 68% lipids by dry weight volume.&lt;ref name="algaeindustrymagazine.com"/&gt;
Development of the farm mainly focuses on 2 phases, production of nutraceutical products and green crude oil to produce biofuel. The main product of their microalgae culture is crude oil, which can be fractioned into the same kinds of fuels and chemical compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://qmabco.com/|title=Home|website=qmabco.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Chemical Society''' ('''ACS''') is a [[scientific society]] based in the [[United States]] that supports scientific inquiry in the field of [[chemistry]].  Founded in 1876 at [[New York University]], the ACS currently has more than 158,000 members at all degree levels and in all fields of chemistry, [[chemical engineering]], and related fields. It is the world's largest [[scientific society]] by membership.&lt;ref name=Fast&gt;{{cite web|title=Fast Facts about ACS|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/about/aboutacs.html|website=American Chemical Society|accessdate=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACS is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization and holds a [[congressional charter]] under [[Title 36 of the United States Code]]. Its headquarters are located in [[Washington, D.C.]], and it has a large concentration of staff in [[Columbus, Ohio]].

The ACS is a leading source of scientific information through its peer-reviewed scientific journals, national conferences, and the [[Chemical Abstracts Service]]. Its publications division produces 51 [[Scientific journal|scholarly journals]] including the prestigious ''[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]'', as well as the weekly trade magazine ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]''. The ACS holds national meetings twice a year covering the complete field of chemistry and also holds smaller conferences concentrating on specific chemical fields or geographic regions. The primary source of income of the ACS is the [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], a provider of chemical databases worldwide.

The organization also publishes textbooks, administers several national chemistry awards, provides grants for scientific research, and supports various educational and outreach activities.

== History ==
[[File:American Chemical Society Building.JPG|thumb|American Chemical Society headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

=== Creation ===
In 1874, a group of American [[chemist]]s gathered at the [[Joseph Priestley House]] to mark the 100th anniversary of [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley's]] discovery of [[oxygen]]. Although there was an American scientific society at that time (the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], founded in 1848), the growth of [[chemistry]] in the U.S. prompted those assembled to consider founding a new society that would focus more directly on theoretical and applied chemistry. Two years later, on April 6, 1876, during a meeting of chemists at the University of the City of New York (now [[New York University]]) the American Chemical Society was founded.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/draperacs.html|title = John W. Draper and the Founding of the American Chemical Society|date = 2001|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = |publisher = American Chemical Society|last = Bohning|first = James J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society received its charter of incorporation from the State of New York in 1877.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Charles F. Chandler]], a professor of chemistry at [[Columbia University]] who was instrumental in organizing the society said that such a body would “prove a powerful and healthy stimulus to original research, … would awaken and develop much talent now wasting in isolation, … [bring] members of the association into closer union, and ensure a better appreciation of our science and its students on the part of the general public.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Although Chandler was a likely choice to become the society's first president because of his role in organizing the society, [[New York University]] chemistry professor [[John William Draper]] was elected as the first president of the society because of his national reputation. Draper was a [[Photochemistry|photochemist]] and pioneering [[photographer]] who had produced one of the first [[Portrait photography|photographic portraits]] in 1840.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Chandler would later serve as president in 1881 and 1889.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACS Presidents, A Chronological List|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/about/president/acspresidents.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth ===
The ''[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]'' was founded in 1879 to publish original chemical research. It was the first journal published by ACS and is still the society's flagship peer-reviewed publication. In 1907, Chemical Abstracts was established as a separate journal (it previously appeared within JACS), which later became the [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], a division of ACS that provides chemical information to researchers and others worldwide. ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' is a weekly trade magazine that has been published by ACS since 1923.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The society adopted a new constitution aimed at nationalizing the organization in 1890.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1905, the American Chemical Society moved from New York City to [[Washington, D.C.]] ACS was reincorporated under a [[congressional charter]] in 1937. It was granted by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and signed by president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Charter&gt;{{cite web|title=ACS Governing Documents Bulletin 5|url=http://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/about/governance/charter/bulletin-5.pdf|website=American Chemical Society|accessdate=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACS's headquarters moved to its current location in downtown Washington in 1941.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Organization ==

=== Divisions ===
ACS first established technical divisions in 1908 to foster the exchange of information among scientists who work in particular fields of chemistry or professional interests. Divisional activities include organizing technical sessions at ACS meetings, publishing books and resources, administering awards and lectureships, and conducting other events. The original five divisions were 1) organic chemistry, 2) industrial chemists and chemical engineers, 3) agricultural and food chemistry, 4) fertilizer chemistry, and 5) physical and inorganic chemistry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The American Chemical Society at 125: A recent history 1976–2001|last = |first = |publisher = American Chemical Society|year = 2002|isbn = 0-8412-3851-0|location = |pages = |editor-last = Reese|editor-first = Kenneth M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, there are 32 technical divisions of ACS.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Technical Division Websites|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/membership-and-networks/td/websites.html|website = American Chemical Society|accessdate = December 24, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151124025637/http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/membership-and-networks/td/websites.html|archive-date = November 24, 2015|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational activities and programs ==

=== Chemical education and outreach ===
ACS states that it offers teacher training to support the professional development of science teachers so they can better present chemistry in the classroom, foster the scientific curiosity of our nation’s youth and encourage future generations to pursue scientific careers.  As of 2009, Clifford and [[Kathryn Hach-Darrow|Kathryn Hach]] donated $33 million to ACS, to continue the work of the Hach Scientific Foundation in supporting high school chemistry teaching.&lt;ref name=Raber&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raber|first1=Linda|title=ACS Receives Hach Funds Multi-million-dollar gift is largest in society's history|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=January 26, 2009|volume=87|issue=4|page=7|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/87/i4/ACS-Receives-Hach-Funds.html|accessdate=January 29, 2016|doi=10.1021/cen-v087n004.p007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Chemical Society sponsors the [[United States National Chemistry Olympiad]] (USNCO), a contest used to select the four-member team that represents the United States at the [[International Chemistry Olympiad]] (IChO).&lt;ref name=Olympiad&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. National Chemistry Olympiad|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/students/highschool/olympiad.html|website=American Chemical Society|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICHO&gt;{{cite web|title=ICHO 2015|url=http://icho2015.msu.az/about/history/|website=ICHO History|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACS Division of [[Chemical education#Postsecondary chemistry education in the United States|Chemical Education]] provides standardized tests for various subfields of chemistry.&lt;ref name=Khine&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khine|first1=Myint Swe|title=Perspectives on scientific argumentation theory, practice and research|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media B.V.|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-94-007-2470-9|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WOv6yvIuSIC&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haney&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haney|first1=Walter M.|last2=Madaus|first2=George F.|last3=Lyons|first3=Robert|title=The Fractured Marketplace for Standardized Testing.|date=2012|publisher=Springer Verlag|isbn=9789401049733|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AI59CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT51|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most commonly used tests are the undergraduate-level tests for general and organic chemistry. Each of these tests consists of 70 multiple-choice questions, and gives students 110 minutes to complete the exam.

The ACS also approves certified undergraduate programs in chemistry. A student who completes the required laboratory and course work—sometimes in excess of what a particular college may require for its [[Bachelor's degree]]—is considered by the Society to be well trained for professional work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| title = Undergraduate Professional Education in Chemistry| publisher = American Chemical Society| date = Spring 2008| location = New York| url = http://portal.acs.org/portal/fileFetch/C/WPCP_008491/pdf/WPCP_008491.pdf| accessdate = June 12, 2010| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327031227/http://portal.acs.org/portal/fileFetch/C/WPCP_008491/pdf/WPCP_008491.pdf| archivedate = March 27, 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACS also coordinates [[National Chemistry Week]] as part of its educational outreach. Since 1977, each year has celebrated a theme, such as "Chemistry colors our world" (2015) and "Energy: Now and forever!" (2013).&lt;ref name=Themes&gt;{{cite web|title=National Chemistry Week Themes|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/outreach/ncw/past.html|website=American Chemical Society|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Green Chemistry Institute ===
The Green Chemistry Institute (GCI) supports the "implementation of [[green chemistry]] and engineering throughout the global chemistry enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About the ACS Green Chemistry Institute®|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/about.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCI organizes an annual conference, the Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference, provides research grants, administers awards, and provides information and support for green chemistry practices to educators, researchers, and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACS Green Chemistry Institute®|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GCI was founded in 1997 as an independent non-profit organization, by chemists [[Joe Breen (chemist)|Joe Breen]] and Dennis Hjeresen in cooperation with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Historical Perspective |url = http://www.warnerbabcock.com/green-chemistry/a-historical-perspective/|website = Warner Babcock Institute|access-date = January 16, 2016|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the GCI became a part of the American Chemical Society.[http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/what-is-green-chemistry/history-of-green-chemistry.html]

=== Petroleum Research Fund ===
The Petroleum Research Fund (PRF) is an endowment fund administered by the ACS that supports advanced education and fundamental research in the petroleum and fossil fuel fields at non-profit institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACS Petroleum Research Fund|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/funding-and-awards/grants/prf.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several categories of grants are offered for various career levels and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Grant Programs|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/funding-and-awards/grants/prf/programs.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund awarded more than $25 million in grants in 2007.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = History of the ACS Petroleum Research Fund|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/funding-and-awards/grants/prf/about/history.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRF traces its origins to the acquisition of the [[UOP LLC|Universal Oil Products]] laboratory by a consortium of oil companies in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Universal Oil Products (UOP) Riverside Laboratory&amp;nbsp;– National Historic Chemical Landmarks|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/uoplaboratory.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companies established a trust fund, The Petroleum Research Fund, in 1944 in order to prevent antitrust litigation tied to their UOP assets. The ACS was named the beneficiary of the trust. The first grants from the PRF were awarded in 1954. In 2000, the trust was transferred to the ACS. The ACS established The American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund and the previous trust was dissolved.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The PRF trust was valued at $144.7 million in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Financial Highlights&amp;nbsp;– 2014 Annual Report |publisher=ACS|url = https://acswebcontent.acs.org/annualreport/financials.html|website = acswebcontent.acs.org|access-date = January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other programs ===
The ACS International Activities is the birthplace of the ACS International Center, an online resource for scientists and engineers looking to study abroad or explore an international career or internship. The site houses information on hundreds of scholarships and grants related to all levels of experience to promote scientific mobility of researchers and practitioners in STEM fields.

The American Chemical Society grants membership to undergraduates as student members provided they can pay the $25 yearly dues. Any university may start its own ACS Student Chapter and receive benefits of undergraduate participation in regional conferences and discounts on ACS publications.

== Awards ==
=== National awards ===
{{Main article|List of American Chemical Society national awards}}

=== Other awards ===
Additional awards are offered by divisions, local sections and other bodies of ACS. The [[William H. Nichols Medal Award]] was the first ACS award to honor outstanding researchers in the field of chemistry. It was established in 1903 by the ACS New York Section and is named for [[William H. Nichols]], an American chemist and businessman and one of the original founders of ACS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NY-ACS Nichols Award Nominations|url = http://www.newyorkacs.org/meetings/Nominations/Nichols.php|website = www.newyorkacs.org|access-date = January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the over 100 Nichols Medalists, 16 have subsequently been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. The [[Willard Gibbs Award]], granted by the ACS Chicago Section, was established in 1910 in honor of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], the [[Yale University]] professor who formulated the [[phase rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Willard Gibbs Award|url = http://chicagoacs.org/content.php?page=Willard_Gibbs_Award|website = chicagoacs.org|access-date = January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgia Local Section of ACS has awarded the [[Herty Medal]] since 1933 recognizing outstanding chemists who have significantly contributed to their chosen fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles H. Herty Award|url=http://georgia.sites.acs.org/awardsandhonors.htm|accessdate=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All chemists in academic, government, or industrial laboratories who have been residing in the southeastern United States for at least 10 years are eligible. (For this purpose Southeastern United States is defined as the union of the following states: Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina.)

The New York Section of ACS also gives Leadership Awards.&lt;ref name=CMEACS&gt;{{cite web|title=CME ACS NY Leadership Awards(TM)|url=http://www.cmeacs.org/awardinfo.html|website=CME ACS|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Leadership Awards are the highest honors given by the Chemical Marketing and Economic Group of ACS NY since December 6, 2012. They are presented to leaders of industry, investments, and other sectors, for their contributions to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) initiatives. Honorees include [[Andrew N. Liveris]] (Dow Chemical),&lt;ref name=CME2014&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Leadership Awards&amp;nbsp;– CME ACS NY Diamond Jubilee|url=http://www.cmeacs.org/award2014.html|website=CME ACS|date=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. Roy Vagelos]] (Regeneron, Merck),&lt;ref name=CME2015&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Leadership Awards&amp;nbsp;– 61 Years of Service|url=http://www.cmeacs.org/award2015.html|website=CME ACS|date=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas M.

== Controversies ==

=== Open access ===
In debates about free access to scientific information, the ACS has been described as "in an interesting dilemma, with some of its representatives pushing for open access and others hating the very thought."&lt;ref name="Rovner2"&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 16, 2005|title=OPENING ACCESS Publishers weigh the risks and benefits of free online journal access|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/83/8320openaccess.html|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|volume=83|issue=20|pages=40–44|last1=Rovner|first1=Sophie L.|accessdate=January 29, 2016|doi=10.1021/cen-v083n020.p040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACS has generally opposed legislation that would mandate free access to scientific journal articles and chemical information, however it has recently launched new [[open access journal]]s and provided authors with open access publishing options.

==== Journals ====
The mid-2000s saw a debate between some research funders (including the federal government), which argued that research they funded should be presented freely to the public,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ledford|first=Heidi|date=October 26, 2006|title=Funding agencies toughen stance on open access|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7114/full/443894b.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=443|issue=7114|pages=894–95|doi=10.1038/443894b|issn=0028-0836|pmid=17065998|bibcode=2006Natur.443..894L}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some publishers (including the ACS), which argued that the costs of peer-review and publishing justified their subscription prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Lawmakers-Hear-Arguments-for/123719|title=Lawmakers Hear Arguments for and Against Open Access to Research|last=Howard|first=Jennifer|date=July 29, 2010|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|issn=0009-5982|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Congress debated legislation that would have instructed the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) to require all investigators it funded to submit copies of final, peer-reviewed journal articles to [[PubMed Central]], a free-access digital repository it operates, within 12 months of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russo|first=Gene|date=June 22, 2006|title=Congress pushes plan to make papers free|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7096/full/441915a.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=441|issue=7096|pages=915–15|doi=10.1038/441915a|issn=0028-0836|pmid=16791162|bibcode=2006Natur.441..915R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suber2"&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 17, 2008|title=An open access mandate for the National Institutes of Health|pmc=3090178|journal=Open Medicine|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e39–e41|last1=Suber|first1=Peter|pmid=21602938}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the [[Association of American Publishers|American Association of Publishers]] (of which ACS is a member) hired a public relations firm to counter the [[open access movement]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giles|first=Jim|date=January 25, 2007|title=PR's 'pit bull' takes on open access|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7126/full/445347a.html|journal=Nature|volume=445|issue=347|page=347|bibcode=2007Natur.445..347G|doi=10.1038/445347a|issn=0028-0836|pmid=17251943|accessdate=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of publishers' opposition, the PubMed Central legislation was passed in December 2007 and became effective in 2008.&lt;ref name="Suber2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chronicle.com/article/New-Open-Access-Requirement/40740|title=New Open-Access Requirement Starts Today at NIH|date=April 7, 2008|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|issn=0009-5982|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the open access issue has continued to evolve, so too has the ACS's position. In response to a 2013 [[Office of Science and Technology Policy|White House Office of Science and Technology Policy]] directive that instructed federal agencies to provide greater access to federally funded research, the ACS joined other scholarly publishers in establishing the Clearinghouse for the Open Research of the United States (Chorus) to allow free access to published articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/publishers-propose-public-private-partnership-to-support-access-to-research/44005|title=Publishers Propose Public-Private Partnership to Support Access to Research|last=Howard|first=Jennifer|date=June 4, 2013|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education Blogs: Wired Campus|access-date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACS has also introduced several open access publishing options for its journals, including providing authors the option to pay an upfront fee to enable free online access to their articles.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libraries.mit.edu/news/offer-access-options/15406/|title=RSC, ACS offer new open access options for authors {{!}} MIT Libraries News|website=libraries.mit.edu|access-date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the ACS launched the first fully open access journal in the society's history, ''ACS Central Science''.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The ACS states that the journal offers the same peer-review standards as its subscription journals, but without publishing charges to either authors or readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2013/october/acs-extends-new-open-access-program-designed-to-assist-authors.html|title=American Chemical Society extends new open access program designed to assist authors|website=American Chemical Society|access-date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second open access title, ''ACS Omega'', an interdisciplinary [[mega journal]], launched in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chronicle.com/article/As-an-Open-Access-Megajournal/234890|title=As an Open-Access Megajournal Cedes Some Ground, a Movement Gathers Steam|last=Basken|first=Paul|date=January 13, 2016|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|issn=0009-5982|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bohne|first=Cornelia|last2=Liz-Marzán|first2=Luis M.|last3=Ganesh|first3=Krishna N.|last4=Zhang|first4=Deqing|date=July 31, 2016|title=Chemistry, From Alpha to Omega, Open to All|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.6b00103|journal=ACS Omega|volume=1|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.1021/acsomega.6b00103|issn=2470-1343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Databases ====
In 2005, the ACS was criticized for opposing the creation of [[PubChem]], which is an [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] [[chemical database]] developed by the NIH's [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]. The ACS raised concerns that the publicly supported PubChem database would duplicate and unfairly compete with their existing fee-based [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] and argued that the database should only present data created by the Molecular Libraries Screening Center initiative of the NIH.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Jocelyn|date=May 6, 2005|title=Chemists Want NIH to Curtail  Database|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/308/5723/774a|journal=Science|volume=308|issue=5723|page=774|doi=10.1126/science.308.5723.774a|issn=0036-8075|pmid=15879180|accessdate=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://groups.lis.illinois.edu/guest_lectures/Murray-Rust/resources/pubchemacs/acscas_statement.pdf|title=American Chemical Society (ACS) and PubChem|last=|first=|date=May 23, 2005|website=|publisher=American Chemical Society|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACS lobbied members of the [[US Congress|United States Congress]] to rein in PubChem&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;David Kestenbaum, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4700306 "Chemical Society: NIH Database  Hurts Business"], ''All Things Considered'', June 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marris2"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 9, 2005|title=Chemistry Society goes head to head with NIH in fight over public database|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/435718a.epdf?referrer_access_token=ZtqdK3M0nZlLDVwH2bJ_PdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PpzJ5wGRUPU5wSuFC9R5vPonrKgEz0vhuEtbW8wYn075iA1IG1c-qUQuQam_LCWoGHmEHvH92hOSMzvw_Ma17OEGVOqqC4WwKLu6Cql_GMtYEivcr5p4BgkmCx0h_s1dmOwW3EWA__FqAziROMb88wWrIei36HHs9U39mT9BnOeu-KPwAnw0nhUW4mNXAw5D4%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.nature.com|journal=Nature|volume=435|pages=718–19|last1=Marris|first1=Emma|accessdate=January 29, 2016|doi=10.1038/435718a|bibcode=2005Natur.435..718M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hired outside lobbying firms to try to persuade congressional members, the NIH, and the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) against establishing a publicly funded database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/open-access-to-science-un/|title=Open Access to Science Under Attack|last=Biello|first=David|publisher=Scientific American|publication-date=January 26, 2007|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACS was unsuccessful, and as of 2012 PubChem is the world's largest free chemical database.&lt;ref name="Noorden2"&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 27, 2012|title=Chemistry’s web of data expands|url=http://www.nature.com/news/chemistry-s-web-of-data-expands-1.10328|journal=Nature|last1=Noorden|first1=Richard Van|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Litigation ===
As a major provider of chemistry related information, ACS has been involved with several legal cases over the past few decades that involve access to its databases, trademark rights, and intellectual property. These include [[Dialog (online database)|''Dialog'']] ''v. American Chemical Society'', a suit claiming antitrust violations in access to ACS databases, settled out of court in 1993;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-9223458/dialog-and-the-american-chemical-society-play-a-high|title="DIALOG and the American Chemical Society Play a High Stakes Game" by O'Leary, Mick&amp;nbsp;– Online, Vol. 15, Issue 1, January 1991 {{!}} Online Research Library: Questia|website=www.questia.com|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/11311/title/Lawsuits-Threaten-ACS--Nonprofit-Status--Financial-Health/|title=Lawsuits Threaten ACS' Nonprofit Status, Financial Health {{!}} The Scientist Magazine®|website=The Scientist|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Chemical Society v.

Leadscope'', a suit alleging stolen trade secrets, concluded in 2012 with ACS losing its trade secrets claim and Leadscope losing its counterclaim of defamation.&lt;ref name="DeMartini2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/business/2008/03/28/LEADSCOPE.ART_ART_03-28-08_C12_HF9P1EG.html|title=Chemical Society loses lawsuit Scientists awarded $27 million in trade dispute|date=March 28, 2008|work=The Columbus Dispatch|last1=DeMartini|first1=Alayna|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reich2"&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 26, 2012|title=Chemical society tried to block business competitor|url=http://www.nature.com/news/chemical-society-tried-to-block-business-competitor-1.11470|journal=Nature|last1=Reich|first1=Eugenie Samuel|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Executive compensation ===
In 2004, a group of ACS members criticized the compensation of former executive director and chief executive officer John Crum, whose total salary, expenses, and bonuses for 2002 was reported to be $767,834.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Chemical-Society-Draws-Fire/10895|title=Chemical Society Draws Fire for Leader's High Pay|last=Jacobson|first=Jennifer|date=September 3, 2004|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|issn=0009-5982|access-date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACS defended the figure, saying that it was in line with that of comparable organizations, including for-profit publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brumfiel|first=Geoff|date=August 26, 2004|title=Director's salary makes chemists see red|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v430/n7003/full/430957a.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=430|issue=7003|pages=957–57|doi=10.1038/430957a|issn=0028-0836|pmid=15329687|bibcode=2004Natur.430..957B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2016}}, two employees were reported to have a total compensation exceeding $900,000, while 694 had a compensation exceeding $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/about/aboutacs/financial/2016-form-990.pdf|title=2016 IRS Form 990|author=ACS|page=8|date=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''BROACH warhead''' is a [[Tandem-charge|multi-stage warhead]] developed by Team BROACH; [[BAE Systems Global Combat Systems Munitions]], [[Thales Missile Electronics]] and [[QinetiQ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themanufacturer.com/uk/profile/6848/BAE_Systems_Land_Systems_Munitions?PHPSESSID=c88 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610230958/http://www.themanufacturer.com/uk/profile/6848/BAE_Systems_Land_Systems_Munitions?PHPSESSID=c88 |archivedate=10 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BROACH stands for '''''B'''omb '''R'''oyal '''O'''rdnance '''A'''ugmented '''CH'''arge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Munitions products|url=http://www.baesystems.com/en/product/munition-products|publisher=[[BAE Systems]]|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of BROACH began in 1991 when Team BROACH consisted of [[British Aerospace]] [[Royal Ordnance|RO Defence]], [[Thomson-CSF|Thomson-Thorn Missile Electronics]] and [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency|DERA]]. The two stage warhead is made up from an initial [[shaped charge]], which cuts a passage through armour, concrete, earth, etc., allowing a larger following warhead to penetrate inside the target. The weapon is designed to allow a cruise missile to achieve the degree of hard-target penetration formerly only possible by the use of [[Laser-guided bomb|laser-guided]] gravity bombs.

The '''Belgrade printing house''' was a printing house established by count ({{lang-sr|knez}}) Radiša Dmitrović in [[Belgrade]], [[Ottoman Serbia]] (today the capital of [[Serbia]]). It was the first printing house in Belgrade.&lt;ref name="Plavšić1959"&gt;{{cite book|last=Plavšić|first=Lazar|title=Srpske štamparije: od kraja XV do sredine XIX veka|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3QLAAAAMAAJ|year=1959|publisher=Udruženje grafičkih preduzeća Jugoslavije|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dmitrović's death, the printing house was taken over by Trojan Gundulić, who organized publishing of the first and only book of this printing house, the Gospel, printed and edited in 1552 by Hieromonk Mardarije.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5678">A 1996&amp;ndash;2004 research project in the Computer Science Division of the University of California, Berkeley, the '''Berkeley IRAM project''' explored [[computer architecture]] enabled by the wide bandwidth between memory and processor made possible when both are designed on the same [[integrated circuit]] (chip).&lt;ref&gt;[http://iram.cs.berkeley.edu/overview.html Project history.] Retrieved 2011-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was envisioned that such a chip would consist primarily of [[random-access memory]] (RAM), with a smaller part needed for the [[central processing unit]] (CPU), the research team used the term "Intelligent RAM" (or IRAM) to describe a chip with this architecture.&lt;ref name="Micro 1997"&gt;Patterson, et al. (1997) ''IEEE Micro,'' '''17''' (2), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intelligent RAM (IRAM)|url=http://iram.cs.berkeley.edu/slides/japan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the [[J–Machine]] project at MIT, the primary objective of the research was to avoid the [[Von Neumann bottleneck]] which occurs when the connection between memory and CPU is a relatively narrow [[memory bus]] between separate integrated circuits.

==Theory==
{{main|computational RAM}}

With strong competitive pressures, the technology employed for each component of a computer system&amp;mdash;principally CPU, memory, and offline storage&amp;mdash;is typically selected to minimize the cost needed to attain a given level of performance. Though both microprocessor and memory are implemented as integrated circuits, the prevailing technology used for each differs; microprocessor technology optimizes speed and memory technology optimizes density. For this reason, the integration of memory and processor in the same chip has (for the most part) been limited to [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM), which may be implemented using circuit technology optimized for logic performance, rather than the denser and lower-cost [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM), which is not. Microprocessor access to off-chip memory costs time and power, however, significantly limiting processor performance. For this reason computer architecture employing a hierarchy of memory systems has developed, in which static memory is integrated with the microprocessor for temporary, easily accessible storage (or cache) of data which is also retained off-chip in DRAM.&lt;ref&gt;Hennesey &amp; Patterson (2007) Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Since the on-chip cache memory is redundant, its presence adds to cost and power. The purpose of the IRAM research project was to find if (in some computing applications) a better trade-off between cost and performance could be achieved with an architecture in which DRAM was integrated on-chip with the processor, thus eliminating the need for a redundant static memory cache&amp;mdash;even though the technology used was not optimum for DRAM implementation.

== Contribution ==
While it is fair to say that Berkeley IRAM did not achieve the recognition that [[Berkeley RISC]] received, the IRAM project was nevertheless influential. 
Although initial IRAM proposals focused on trade-offs between CPU and DRAM, IRAM research came to concentrate on vector instruction sets.
Its publications were early advocates of the incorporation of vector processing and vector instruction sets into microprocessors, and several commercial microprocessors, such as the Intel [[Advanced Vector Extensions|AVX]], subsequently adopted vector processing instruction set extensions.

The '''X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing''' ('''AAW''') development program is a completed  [[United States|American]] research project that was undertaken jointly by the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] (AFRL), [[Boeing Phantom Works]] and [[NASA]]'s [[Dryden Flight Research Center]], where the technology was flight tested on a modified [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]]. Active Aeroelastic Wing Technology is a technology that integrates wing aerodynamics, controls, and structure to harness and control wing aeroelastic twist at high speeds and dynamic pressures. By using multiple leading and trailing edge controls like "aerodynamic tabs", subtle amounts of aeroelastic twist can be controlled to provide large amounts of wing control power, while minimizing maneuver air loads at high wing strain conditions or aerodynamic drag at low wing strain conditions. The flight program which first proved the use of AAW technology in full scale was the X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing program.

Gerry Miller and Jan Tulinius led the development of the initial concept during wind tunnel testing in the mid 1980s under Air Force contract.&lt;ref name="redesignation"&gt;[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123035661 Active Aeroelastic Wing flight research vehicle receives X-53 designation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605105552/http://www.wpafb.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123035661 |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The designation "X-52" was skipped in sequence to avoid confusion with Boeing's [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bomber. Ed Pendleton served as the Air Force's program manager.
&lt;ref&gt;Pendleton, E., Griffin, K., Kehoe, M., and Perry, B., "A Flight Research Program for Active Aeroelastic Wing Technology ," Paper 96-1574, Proceedings of the 37th AIAA Structures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference, Salt Lake City, Utah, 15–17 April 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==
Active Aeroelastic Wing (AAW) Technology is multidisciplinary in that it integrates air vehicle aerodynamics, active controls, and structural aeroelastic behavior to maximize air vehicle performance. The concept uses wing aeroelastic flexibility for a net benefit and enables the use of high aspect ratio, thin, swept wings that are aeroelastically deformed into shapes for optimum performance. This makes it possible to achieve the multi-point aerodynamic performance required of future fighter, bomber, and transport aircraft.

AAW Technology employs wing aeroelastic flexibility for a net benefit through use of multiple leading and trailing edge control surfaces activated by a digital flight control system. At higher dynamic pressures, AAW control surfaces are used as "tabs" which are deflected into the air stream to produce favorable wing twist instead of the reduced control generally associated with “aileron reversal” caused by trailing edge surfaces. The energy of the air stream is employed to twist the wing with less control surface motion; the wing itself creates the control forces.

AAW's use of favorable wing twist response at high speeds, is viewed as a return to the wing-warping concept used by the [[Wright Brothers]]. Active aeroelastic wing technology enables a higher aspect ratio, more aerodynamically efficient wing which can be used to reduce induced drag at low wing strain conditions and, at higher strain conditions, reduce maneuver air loads. Overall benefits of AAW technology to future systems include substantially increased control power, reduced aerodynamic drag, reduced aircraft structural weight, and increased design latitude in terms of wing span, sweep, and thickness.

The pre-production version of the F/A-18 was an ideal host aircraft for proving AAW technology, a relatively high wing aspect ratio for a fighter, with adequate strength, but no additional stiffness was added for static aeroelastic issues. The X-53 F/A-18 was modified to allow two leading edge control surfaces to work in concert with its two trailing edge surfaces to control wing aeroelastic twist and provide excellent high speed rolling performance.

===Aeroelasticity and controls===
An aircraft maneuvers by deploying [[flight control surfaces]] into the airflow, which changes the air force on the surface. For instance, the [[aileron]]s on the [[wing]]s used to roll an aircraft work by increasing or decreasing the lift of the outer portion of one wing, while doing the opposite on the other wing. This imbalance in lift forces causes the aircraft to rotate around its longitudinal axis.

It is the latter effect that is considered to be detrimental. When the aileron is deployed, the airflow is deflected at a point well behind the [[center of lift]]. This creates a torque around the span axis of the wing, which "flattens" it in relation to the airflow and reduces the effectiveness of the aileron input. Although this effect is quite small at low speeds, at higher speeds the amount of airflow over the surface can be considerable, enough to cause the entire wing to flex, an effect known as [[aeroelasticity]].

Since the control force of the aileron is a function of speed, and an aircraft has to be maneuverable at landing and takeoff speeds, there is a lower limit to the size of the control surfaces that can be used. In some cases, like the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and [[Mitsubishi Zero]], this meant that at faster speeds the forces on the controls were extremely high. In the case of the Spitfire, these forces acted on a very thin wing that was highly elastic, and in dives the wing would twist so much that the lift curve was opposed to the motion of the aileron, reversing the direction of the roll. This problem required several rounds of upgrades to correct.

===Active controls===
[[File:F-18A Active Aeroelastic Wing flight test.ogg|thumb|X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing (AAW) flight test, March 2005]]

The same problems affect modern aircraft as well, but today's wings are engineered with greater stiffness, to reduce the problem. Once the plane is built and flown, the flight control software is then adjusted to correct for the loss of control due to aeroelasticity. However, this simply hides the problem; the aeroelasticity still exists and is affecting the overall control authority. To correct this the flight controller uses more control input to offset any loss of effectiveness, which increases the spanwise torque loads on the aircraft's wing.

AAW developed from the simple observation that the aeroelasticity can be offset by the deployment of other control surfaces on the wing. In particular, almost all modern aircraft use some form of [[Leading edge slats|slat]] along the wing's [[leading edge]] to provide more lift during certain portions of flight. By deploying the slats at the same time as the ailerons, the torque can be equalled out on either side of the spars, eliminating the twisting, which improves the control authority of the ailerons. This means that less aileron input is needed to produce a given motion, which, in turn, will reduce [[aileron drag]] and its associated negative control aspects. Better yet, the wing is already designed to be extremely strong in the lift component, eliminating the torque requires lift, converting the undesired torque into an acceptable lift component.

But if one can use the controls to eliminate the twisting and its negative effects on control input, the next step is to deliberately introduce a twisting component to ''improve'' the control authority. When applied correctly, the wing will twist less and in an opposite direction to a conventional wing during maneuvering.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.afrlhorizons.com/Briefs/0006/VA9901.html Active Aeroelastic Wing]'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618092639/http://www.afrlhorizons.com/Briefs/0006/VA9901.html|date=18 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So this change, which can be accomplished in software, benefits overall performance.

===AAW testing===
To test the AAW theory, NASA and the USAF agreed to fund development of a single demonstrator, based on the F/A-18. Work started by taking an existing F/A-18 airframe modified with a preproduction wing, and added an outboard leading edge flap drive system and an updated flight control computer. Active aeroelastic wing control laws were developed to flex the wing, and flight instrumentation was used to accurately measure the aeroelastic performance of the [[wing planform]]. Flight software was then modified for flight testing, and the aircraft first flew in modified form in November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Boeing F/A-18 with Active Aeroelastic Wing Completes First Flight|publisher=Boeing|date=18 November 2002|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2002/q4/nr_021118m.html|accessdate=30 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106173058/http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2002/q4/nr_021118m.html|archivedate=6 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft successfully proved the viability of the concept in full scale during roll maneuver testing in 2004–2005. The test aircraft was re-designated X-53 on August 16, 2006, per memo by USAF Deputy Chief of Staff, Strategic Plans and Programs.&lt;ref name=redesignation/&gt;

'''Bulk micromachining''' is a process used to produce [[micromachinery]] or [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS).

Unlike [[surface micromachining]], which uses a succession of [[thin film]] deposition and selective etching, bulk micromachining defines structures by selectively etching inside a substrate. Whereas surface micromachining creates structures ''on top'' of a substrate, bulk micromachining produces structures ''inside'' a substrate.

Usually, [[silicon]] [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]s are used as substrates for bulk micromachining, as they can be [[anisotropic]]ally wet etched, forming highly regular structures. Wet etching typically uses [[alkaline]] liquid [[solvent]]s, such as [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) or [[tetramethylammonium hydroxide]] (TMAH) to dissolve silicon which has been left exposed by the photolithography masking step. These alkali solvents dissolve the silicon in a highly anisotropic way, with some crystallographic orientations dissolving up to 1000 times faster than others. Such an approach is often used with very specific crystallographic orientations in the raw silicon to produce V-shaped grooves. The surface of these grooves can be atomically smooth if the etch is carried out correctly, and the dimensions and angles can be precisely defined. Pressure sensors are usually created by bulk micromachining technique.

Bulk micromachining starts with a silicon wafer or other substrates which is selectively etched, using [[photolithography]] to transfer a pattern from a mask to the surface. Like surface micromachining, bulk micromachining can be performed with wet or dry etches, although the most common etch in silicon is the anisotropic wet etch. This etch takes advantage of the fact that silicon has a [[crystal]] structure, which means its atoms are all arranged periodically in lines and planes. Certain planes have weaker bonds and are more susceptible to etching. The etch results in pits that have angled walls, with the angle being a function of the crystal orientation of the substrate. This type of etching is inexpensive and is generally used in early, low-budget research.

'''Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects''' is a process dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from ceramic. Typically this activity of [[conservation-restoration]] is undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]], especially when dealing with object of [[cultural heritage]]. Ceramics are created from a production of coatings of inorganic, nonmetallic materials using heating and cooling to create a glaze. Typically the coatings are permanent and sustainable for utilitarian and decorative purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctioa.org/index.cfm?pi=GL&amp;gaction=list&amp;grp=C Ceramic Tile and Stone Standards]. Ctioa.org. Retrieved on 2012-03-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The cleaning, handling, storage, and in general treatment of ceramics is consistent with that of [[glass]] because they are made of similar [[oxygen]]-rich components such as [[silica]]tes.&lt;ref name=Little&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=Margaret|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection.

Abrams, Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-3174-5|pages=97–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deterioration of ceramics ==
It is in the nature of all the materials used for construction to eventually degrade and deteriorate. Degradation of an object occurs as a result of the interaction between the environment or with the materials that form the object however, in the case of ceramics, environmental factors are the major cause. There are several ways in which ceramics break down physically and chemically.

Additionally the type of ceramic will affect how it will break down. Unfired clay, like [[mud]] and clay [[adobe]], is clay that is fired under 1000&amp;nbsp;°C or 1832&amp;nbsp;°F. This type of clay is water-soluble and unstable. Earthenware is clay that has been fired between 1000-1200&amp;nbsp;°C or 1832°-2192&amp;nbsp;°F. The firing makes the clay water [[insoluble]] but does not allow the formation of an extensive glassy or [[Glass|vitreous]] within the body. Although water-insoluble, the porous body of earthenware allows water to penetrate. A glaze can be applied that will protect the vessel from water. Due to its porosity, earthenware is susceptible to moisture and creates problems including cracks, breaks and mold growth. Porcelain and stoneware is fired at the highest temperatures between 1200-1400&amp;nbsp;°C or 2192-2552&amp;nbsp;°F. Porcelain clay mixtures are fired to create a non-porous and very hard surface.&lt;ref name="Craft"/&gt;{{rp|p.98}} However, the materials also create a very brittle surface which increases the potential for chips, cracks and breaks.

=== Physical degradation ===
Due to their fragility, damage to ceramics typically comes from mishandling and packing. However, other factors such as [[vandalism]], [[frost]], [[mold]], and other similar occurrences can also inflect harm.&lt;ref name="Buys"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buys|first=Susan|title=The Conservation and Restoration of Ceramics|year=1993|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford|isbn=0 7506 0957 5|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manufacturing defects ====
Also known as inherent vice, the intrinsic instability of the fabric and components of an objects can lead to its own physical degradation. This is difficult to prevent because it occurs within the fabric of the material and therefore is a natural occurrence. [[Wear|Deterioration]] of an object can happen even before the object is used. How the piece is created can instil manufacturing defects in the piece.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.61}} This means that objects can be damaged even before they are used. This would include a body that contains inadequate qualities of (filler (materials)). A second typical defect is from poor design and construction. An example of this would be a ceramic piece with a handle that is too thin to support the weight of the cup. A third manufacturing defect includes careless firing. A ceramic piece that has been fired too rapidly or allowed to dry too fast will crack or break.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.20}}

==== Impact and abrasions ====
With its delicate nature, ceramics that have been used over a period of time will sustain cracks, nicks, and blemishes. Additionally in a museum environment, damages can occur from packing storing, and handling of objects.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.22}}

==== Frost ====
Damage can occur when ceramics are exposed to freezing temperatures and frost. The problem occurs when [[ice]] [[crystals]] form inside of the pores of the ceramic piece. The frost inside of the pores will exert pressure onto the fabric of the pottery and cause the material to crack and break.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.24}}

==== Mold growth ====
Opposite of frost is heat and humidity. When the humidity is high [[mold]]s can begin to form on ceramic, particularly ones in which there is no glaze. Spores of molds are found throughout the atmosphere and will attached to any organic residues nearby, such as ceramics. Earthenware ceramics are frequently affected due to their porosity and lack of glaze.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.25}}

=== Chemical degradation ===
{{About||Additional information on chemical degradation|Chemical decomposition}}
Chemical degradation of objects occurs not in the physical structure of the object but rather in at the chemical or compound level. Compounds begin to breakdown into more simpler compounds and is often an undesired reaction. The degradation of the chemical component of an object will hinder or weaken the stability of the object when exposed to environmental factors such as water, air, pollution, heat, humidity, and the like.

==== Water ====
Water can dissolve or deform ceramics that have been low fired, i.e. temperatures around 600&amp;nbsp;°C. Ceramic fired in high temperatures may also be susceptible to water if their mineral particles are soluble in water, for example [[Gypsum]] or [[calcite]]. Additionally the different compounds in water can flux and react in different ways to different ceramics. In naturally occurring water, [[carbon dioxide]] is dissolved and can create a chemical reaction with minerals in clay bodies that may form [[calcium bicarbonate]] which is very soluble. Stagnant water is less damaging because the carbon dioxide is not exhausted.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.27}}

==== Soluble salts ====
A common degradation issue in ceramics involves [[soluble]] [[salts]]. Soluble salts can either enter the [[clay]] body from the environment, for example from being buried underground for decades, or they are already naturally occurring due to the components of the materials or clay used. Non-archaeological objects, such as modern dishware, can acquire salts from normal use such as storing salt. Soluble salts respond to changes in humidity both high and low. In high humidity salts become soluble and in low humidity they [[crystallize]]. The changing from soluble to crystallization and back damages the surface of the ceramic because salt crystals are larger than liquid salt and therefore will shrink and expand the ceramic body. A white haze on the surface is the first indication of soluble salts, which is the salt crystallizing. Over time, the physical component of the body will crumble until it is completely destroyed.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.61}}

== Preventive care of ceramics ==
{{Main|Collections care}}
In the realm of conservation there are two distinct practices: non-interventive and active conservation. Non-interventive types of conservation are used to control the surrounding environment such as light, humidity, and temperature. Active conservation is when a conservator practices treatments to alleviate physical problems in the object such as fading, chipping, or breaks.

=== Display ===
Although ceramics are utilitarian, some pieces are made to be artwork and therefore displayed. Displaying an object improperly can cause damages either physical or chemically from the environment. One of the most common causes for damages is a ceramic piece falling over or off a shelf. To prevent this issue, many historic houses will line storage and display shelves with a thin layer of ethafoam ([[polyethylene]] foam) or [[bubble wrap]].&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.63}}

=== Storage ===
[[File:Ceramic ring housed in blue board box.JPG|right|thumb|300px|This ceramic ring is housed in a blue board box with an acrylic plastic lid. The ring is laid upon a layer of carved ethafoam to prevent it from shifting during handling.]]
Ceramics are very delicate in nature and damages can occur even when they are stored away. The most common way in which ceramics become damaged is when they are stacked one inside the other. Unless this is part of the original design, this will typically cause nicks, cracks, or breaks. Some ceramics, depending on their provenance, survive better in different temperature and [[humidity]] conditions. [[Pottery]] that has been buried, such as from an archaeological site, adheres better to storage at a constant low humidity. Low humidity will help to keep any salts from [[efflorescing]] which can mar the surface as well as remove the surface glaze.&lt;ref name=Bachmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Bachmann|first=Konstanze|title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|year=1992|publisher=Smithonsian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1-56098-174-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general ceramics are typically inert and are not sensitive to elevated light levels. However, extreme changes in temperature and humidity can cause chemical and physical damage. Typically museums strive to store ceramics, as well as many other material types, in a stable temperature of 68&amp;nbsp;°F with ± 3°.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.61}} Additionally relative humidity should be stabilized at 50% also with a ±5%. Storing objects near windows, heaters, fireplaces, and exterior walls can create an unstable environment with temperature and humidity fluctuation and increase potential for damages.

Some storing materials can be harmful to ceramic objects. [[Wool]] [[felt]] attracts and harbors insects including [[moths]] and [[silverfish]] which can be potentially very harmful to other collection material types. [[Polyurethane]] foam deteriorates over time which leaves a by-product that are sticky and acidic.&lt;ref name="Craft"/&gt;{{rp|p.102}}

=== Handling ===
One of the cardinal rules in object handling is to treat every object as if it is fragile and easily breakable. Museum technicians, curators, and conservators are trained to prepare a moving plan before an object is even touched that way minimal damage can occur when handling or moving an object. In the museum field is it a known fact that a vessel, or any object, should be held and handled by its strongest part, such as the base, and with both hands. Areas such as the handle or neck of a vessel tend to be the weakest points and may break if picked up by these components.&lt;ref name="Bachmann"/&gt;{{rp|p.98}}

== Removal of previous conservation actions ==
Damages also occur to ceramics from previous restoration. Although the intent was to repair the object for use or display, some dated practices are now known to increase damages either physically, from rivets or staples, or chemically, from old used adhesives that off-gas.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.61}}

=== Removal of surface coating ===
Overpaint is a technique that is used to cover imperfection on the surface of a ceramic piece. Differences can be seen to the naked eye due to discoloration, being matched poorly, and change in texture or gloss. subtle difference can also been seen by restorers by using lighting and magnification. Overpaint and surface coatings can be removed either mechanically or with the use of solvents.

Mechanical removal of overpaint include physical techniques to remove the coating from the surface. On a glazed surface a sharp needle or scalpel can be used. If mechanical removal is not possible without damaging the surface then solvents can be used instead. The archetype solvents typically used are water, [[white spirit]], industrial methylated spirits ([[denatured alcohol]]), [[acetone]], and [[Dichloromethane]] which is usually found in the form of a commercial [[paint stripper]]. The appropriate solvent works by being applied to the ceramic surface by a cotton wool swab and is rolled on the surface rather than being wiped. Wiping the solvent on the surface will push the paint into the surface rather than lift it off.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.75–77}}

=== Removal of filling materials ===
Fill materials are used to fill in missing parts or breaks in a ceramic piece in order to stabilize the piece. A wide range of materials and techniques have been used to restore losses in ceramics. Today the most common filling materials are made from calcium-sulphate-based fillers or synthetic resins based on epoxy, acrylic, or polyester resin. These new resins are stronger and do not harm the object. Removing previous filling materials, either mechanically or chemically, and replacing them with new fillers can help keep the piece strong and stable.

Fillers can be removed physically by mechanical ways, depending on the filler material type.  Cement mortar can be chiselled away with a hammer and chisel gradually. Plaster is easily removed through mechanical methods such as chiselling and chipping away with sharp implements. Saws, drills, and other mechanical methods can be used to remove the bulk of protruding materials, however scratches, chips, and breaks can occur.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.77–78}}

A second option to removing filler material is chemically. Typically, chemical removal is used once the bulk of filler material is left and only a small portion is left.

Unlike adhesives, fills tend to be easier to remove and dismantle from ceramics. Plaster of Paris is one example of a fill that comes apart easily with warm.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.37}}

=== Removal of adhesives ===
[[Image:Minoan Ceramic 2.jpg|right|thumb|375px|A Minoan ceramic piece from the Archaeological Museum of Herakleion that has gone under restoration]]
The selection for the proper solvent is based on the identification of the adhesive itself. Every adhesive has a particular solvent that work best to break down its chemical composition. Color, hardness, and other physical properties will allow for identification of the adhesive. The adhesive can be soften once exposed, either in a liquid of [[vapor]] form, of the solvent for some time. The length of time depends on the solubility of the adhesive and the thickness of the joint. Porous bodies, low-fired clays, are sometimes pre-soaked in water to prevent the adhesive from being drawn back into the body once it joins with the removal solution. If the adhesive that is being removed is part of the support for the object, then supports, such as tissue paper or propping up the object, will be used to make sure the object does not sustain damages once the adhesive is removed. Sometimes if the adhesive is not softened enough if will remove part of the surface on the ceramic if pressure is applied. The information on solvents for specific adhesives are found below, under each adhesive section.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.78–79}}

== Cleaning ==
Removal of surface dirt and deposits is beneficial for the health and longevity of an object because it will prevent the dirt from becoming drawn into the body. Dust and grease may be held on the surface loosely by electrostatic forces or weak chemical bonds and are easily removed. Some deposits, such as [[calcium salts]], can be strongly attached to a ceramic surface, especially if the surface is unglazed. There are two main methods in which ceramics are cleaned and treated: mechanically and chemically.

Not all ceramic pieces are dry when they need cleaning. Some ceramics, such as those that are excavated archaeologically, will be damp or wet in nature. Conservators tend to remove the surface dirt before the object is completely dry. This is done because it is easier to do before the dirt hardens and because as it dried the dirt may shrink and cause physical damage to the ceramic surface. Some ceramics are kept damp until treatment can be completed.

=== Mechanical methods ===
Mechanical methods include [[dust]]ing, picking and cutting, and abrading. Mechanical cleaning is typically much easier to control than chemical treatments and there is no danger of dirt being drawn into a solution and then absorbed by the ceramic. The danger of mechanical cleaning is the potential for the surface to break or become scratched with a tool. Dusting is used when dirt is not strongly adhered to the surface of the ceramic and is carried out by either a brush or a soft cloth. Large ceramic vessels are cleaned with delicate [[vacuum cleaner]] with a soft, [[muslin]]-covered head. Picking and cutting is used when there are hardened dirt, encrustations, or old restoration materials closely adheres to the surface. Needles, sharp scalpels, other custom made tools, usually made from wood, and electric vibrotools are used. The dangers with these tools are the increase potential for scratches, gouges, cracking, and breaking of the object due to pressure.

Abrading is the process in which surface deposits are removed using [[abrasive]]s. Abrasives come in both solid and [[cream]] forms. Solid forms of abrasives include glass fiber brush or a [[rubber]] [[Dental drill#Dental burr|burr]] on a dental drill. Cream forms are usually attached to paper or film. Polishing creams are commonly used to remove thin layers of [[insoluble]] surface deposits such calcium. These creams can also remove surface dirt and marks made by tools. The best creams of ceramic do not have [[oil]], [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]], or [[bleach]] as additives and are used only on glazed ceramics.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.86–87}}

=== Chemical methods ===
Chemical methods for cleaning ceramics involve water, solvents, acids, and alkalis. Prolonged soaking in water may be used as a conservation method. The goal is to either remove stains from the surface or to remove the soluble salts in the clay body.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.27}}

== Repair and restoration==
The repair and restoration of ceramics has occurred since ceramics were invented including fillings, adhesives, reinforcements, and even patch work. The history of ceramic repair is vast and ranges from different methods and methodologies. For example, in 16th century China, people would repair broken ceramics by using pieces from other objects to disguise the patch. A sixteenth-century manuscript describes the process of patching broken ceramics:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 16th century - "Old pieces of porcelain from any famous kiln such as censers lack ears or feet or if vases have damaged mouth rims one can use old bits to patch the old; and if one adds glaze and then bakes it is just the same as the old. But the colour is weak at the patch. Yet people prefer this to the new stuff. And if one uses the method of blowing the glaze on to the patched parts there is still less of a trace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayer|first=G|title=The Potteries of China|year=1951|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
|}
 
Today there are new advances in ceramic restoration including consolidation, bonding, adhesives, dowels, rivets, and fillers.

=== Consolidation ===
Consolidation is the process in which the fabric of the ceramic is strengthened by introducing a material into the fabric that will bind together. The most common ceramics that need consolidation are excavated pieces because they tend to have lost their bonding fabrics due to leeching or have absorbed soluble salts. A consolidant works in two ways: it either links to the particles in the ceramic chemically or it may form a support system mechanically without reacting with the fabric itself. Chemical consolidants that are used in modern conservation include [[isocyanates]], [[silanes]], siloxnes, and [[methyl methacrylate]]s, however the consolidants that create a mechanical support system are used more frequently.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.106}}

==== Adhesives ====
{{For|Additional information on Adhesives|Adhesive}}
[[File:Cattien ceramic bowl.png|right|thumb|275px|Repaired ceramic bowl from the National Museum of Vietnam History]]
A chemical compound that adheres or bonds items together, such as pieces of ceramic. In ceramic conservation there are several different types that range from natural to man-made adhesives. Conservators characterise the best [[adhesive]] as one which can be undone.

===== Animal glue =====
{{About||Additional information on Animal Glue|Animal glue}}
Animal glue is an adhesive that contains various animal parts such as bone, skin, or fish and is widely used. It is a soft adhesive and can appear white, but usually has a pale yellow or brown appearance. Animal glue is very soft and can easily be broken down and removed with warm water and steam.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Nigel|title=Porcelain: repair and restoration, a handbook|year=2002|publisher=The British Museum Press|location=London|isbn=0 7141 2757 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although easily reversible, the relative ease with which the glue breaks down makes it a less strong bonding method.

===== Shellac =====
{{About||Additional information on Shellac|Shellac}}
A widely used old adhesive that is orange or very dark brown in appearance. Once dried, the adhesive is very hard and becomes increasingly more brittle over time. Shellac does not break down easily with commercially available products. Additionally, the resin has naturally-occurring dyes that can stain ceramic pink or black. The solvent that works best on this resin is [[Industrial methylated spirit]] or (IMA).&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.31}} Shellac is prepared by dissolving flakes of shellac in hot [[alcohol]]. The properties of shellac make it vulnerable to climatic conditions and inclined to deteriorate over time. Damage can even occur to shellac under the hot light of photography.&lt;ref name="Koob 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koob|first=Stephen|title=The Removal of Aged Shellac Adhesive from Ceramics|journal=Studies in Conservation|year=1979|volume=24|pages=134–135|doi=10.1179/sic.1979.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Epoxy resin =====
{{About||Additional information on epoxy Resin|Epoxy}}
This type of resin is typically used post-1930s and is an indication of modern conservation work. Generally epoxy is very hard but unlike shellac is not brittle. The color of epoxy resin can range from yellow/green to a dark yellow/brown. Yellowing of the resin is an indication of aging. Warm to hot water or [[acetone]] are known to be the solvents of this adhesive.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.31}}

===== Rubber adhesives =====
{{About||Additional information on rubber adhesives|Rubber cement}}
Rubber cements are solutions of synthetic or natural rubber products in solvents, with or without resins and gums. Vulcanizers, accelerators, and stabilizers are considered problematic due to the nature of their compounds. One example is the additive of sulfur which is harmful to some types of material, including [[silver]], because it can cause discoloration.&lt;ref name="Hatchfield"/&gt;{{rp|p.99}} Rubber adhesives can be confused with epoxy resins due to their similar appearance. However, unlike epoxy resins, rubber adhesives will stretch when pulled. Nitromors or Polystrippa solvent brands are used as a solvent but warm water can also loosen the bond.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

===== Vinyl acetate polymers =====
{{About||Additional information on Vinyl acetate polymers|Vinyl acetate}}
Vinyl acetate polymers include polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetal; all come from reaction products of vinyl acetate. Some forms of acetates are known to be acidic and will do damage to an object with direct contact. Additionally, polyvinyl acetate mixtures tend to degrade in storage and release acetic acid, which in some cases can corrode lead.&lt;ref name=Hatchfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatchfield|first=Pamela|title=Pollutants in the Museum Environment: Practical Strategies for Problem Solving in Design, Exhibition and Storage|year=2002|publisher=Archetype Publications Ltd|location=London|isbn=1-873132-96-4|pages=98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compound's coloring ranges from clear/white to a soft yellow. As it ages, it will change to a deeper yellow. It can have a similar appearance to rubber adhesives but the difference is that PVA turns white when comes into contact with water. Warm water and acetone are typically used as solvents.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

===== Cellulose nitrate =====
{{About||Additional information on Cellulose nitrate|Nitrocellulose}}
There are early and modern forms of this adhesive. While both tend to tinge with yellow as they age, the early form tends to become more brittle than the modern version, which contains a [[plasticizer]] to make the compound more stable. As with many adhesives, acetone is generally used as a solvent, however IMS can also be used.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

===== Paraloid B-72 =====
{{About||Additional information on Paraloid B-72|Paraloid B-72}}
B-72 is a [[thermoplastic]] resin that was created by Rohm and Haas for use as a surface coating and as a vehicle for [[Flexographic ink]]. However B-72 is now being used more as an adhesive specifically for ceramic and glass. One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidate is that it is stronger and harder than polyvinyl acetate without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically-used adhesives and tolerates stress and strain on a join that most others can not. One major drawback to using B-72 is the difficulty of applying the acrylic resin as an adhesive, as is difficulty in manipulating the substance as a workable agent. The most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone.&lt;ref name=Koob&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koob|first=Stephen|title=The Use of Paraloid B-72 as an adhesive. Its application for archaeological ceramics and other materials|journal=Studies in Conservation|date=30 April 1986|volume=31|pages=7–14|doi=10.1179/sic.1986.31.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike cellulose nitrate, B-72 does not need additives like [[plasticizer]]s to stabilize its durability. Fumed [[colloidal silica]] is a chemical that can be added to help with the workability of the resin. Additionally research shows that the silica will better distribute stress and strain that occurs during evaporation of the solvent and during the setting of the adhesive film.&lt;ref name="Koob"/&gt;{{rp|p.9}}

=== Dowels and rivets ===
[[Dowel]]s and [[rivet]]s are physical ways in which ceramics can be reinforced and strengthen beneath the surface. Dowels are cylindrical rods that consist of [[wood]], [[metal]], or [[plastic]]. They are drilled into the ceramic piece and usually are set in the hole with an adhesive that is used to repair the ceramic piece. Removing dowels can be hard because they lie under the surface and are usually hidden. Conservators will cut through dowels with a [[piercing saw]] and soften the area with a solvent, like acetone to remove two pieces of ceramic from one another.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.40}}

Riveting is a process in which holes are drilled in the surface of the ceramic, but does not go completely through the piece. The rivets are angled toward the joint and provide additional structural support.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.81}} There are two methods to removing rivets: the 'cut' and 'pull'. The 'cut' method consists of cutting the rivets through the middle with a file and then pulled out. The 'pull' method involves placing a thin blade under the rivet and pushing out any [[plaster]] packing. This method uses leverage to pull the rivet from the ceramic piece.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.38}}

=== Fillers ===
Fillers are used to replace gaps and losses from ceramic materials for either aesthetic reasons or for support. There are several different filler materials used in ceramics including [[plaster of Paris]] and other commercially available [[putties]] and fillers.

Plaster of Paris is a material that consists of [[calcium sulphate]] hemihydrate power and is produced by heating [[gypsum]] to 120&amp;nbsp;°C. The chemical formula is as follows: :CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''Heat'' → CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·½H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  +  1½ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (released as steam). When mixed with water, an [[exothermic reaction]] occurs and forms a hard white filling similar to density of fired ceramics. Different grades of plasters are available and vary based on their particle size, setting time, density, expansion, and color.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.198}}

A thermoplastic [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[wax]] resin mixture developed by John W Burke and Steve Colton in 1997 can be used to compensate losses in objects from translucent materials such as [[alabaster]], [[marble]], [[calcite]], [[diorite]], and [[anhydrite]]. The mixture consists of [[polyvinyl acetate]] (PVAC) AYAC, [[ethylene]] [[acrylic acid]] (EAA) [[copolymers]] A-C 540, and 580, [[antioxidants]] Irganox 1076 or 1035, dry [[pigment]]s, marble powder, and other additives which were all melted together. This wax resin is a better substitute to wax-resins because wax collects dust and dirt and make the fill noticeable. Polyester resin and epoxies are [[toxic]] and [[Poison|noxious]]. The wax-resin is fast and easy to use, making it a possible new alternative to fill materials in the conservation field. The wax-resin works best on losses that allow for large contact with the original, primed surface and on losses that are thicker than 1/16in. Shallow losses and small gaps are more difficult due to the ease in which the fill is pulled out.&lt;ref name=Wax&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gansicke|first=Susanne|author2=Hirx, John|title=The Translucent Wax-Resin Fill Material for the Compensation of Losses in Objects|journal=Journal of American Institute for Conservation|year=1997|volume=36|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.1179/019713697806113648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retouching ===

== Education and training ==
In France, conservators specialized in earthenware and glassware are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.

==Early childhood==
Early on in her childhood, Cooper Harris attended an arts-based school system, [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schooling]]. She attended the [[Emerson Waldorf School]] in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Cooper Harris trained at the [[University of North Carolina School of the Arts]]. She was among the six women to matriculate from her graduating class.

==Career==

===As an Actress===
Upon her move to [[New York City]] Harris was cast in the soap opera, [[As the World Turns]]. After her role on the TV  Harris stepped in to play a leading role in an off-Broadway play at the [[Cherry Lane Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cherry Lane Theatre|url=http://www.cherrylanetheatre.org|website=cherrylanetheatre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the show closed, Harris moved to [[Los Angeles]] and into a role in a [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount film]] called [[Dough Boys (film)|Dough Boys]], which was her entrée into the Hollywood entertainment scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 Tips for Your On-Camera Debut|url=http://women2.com/2015/06/23/making-your-camera-debut/|website=women2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cooper Harris|url=http://www.omnilexica.com/?q=cooper+harris|website=omnilexica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cooper Harris Cheery in Floral Dress for Exclusive Lifestyle Shoot|url=http://www.glamcheck.com/entertainment/2012/09/26/cooper-harris-cheery-exclusive-lifestyle-shoot/|website=GlamCheck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eades|first1=Chris|title=Who Is The New Girl?|url=http://cbs.soapsindepth.com/posts/who-is-the-new-girl-82602|website=CBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a Tech Entrepreneur===
During her stint on [[The Young and the Restless|Young and the Restless]], Cooper became interested in entrepreneurship and started attending hackathons. Having grown up with a brother who was a computer engineer and a father who was a serial entrepreneur, Harris stated that she was interested in a field that would allow both creativity and the ability to control her own destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COOPER HARRIS – CEO &amp; FOUNDER OF KLICKLY|url=http://businessrockstars.com/cooper-harris-ceo-founder-of-klickly/|website=businessrockstars|access-date=2016-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202232123/http://businessrockstars.com/cooper-harris-ceo-founder-of-klickly/#|archive-date=2016-02-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitler|first1=Kimberly|title=Former Samsung CMO On Making The Transition To A Start-Up|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2015/04/14/a-big-c-level-challenge-finding-the-right-job-and-boss/#df3d4e41319f|website=forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris won the AT&amp;T Hackathon in [[Los Angeles]], and shortly thereafter build the first Innovation and Tech Summit during the [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance film festival]], called Collective.

In [[materials science]] and [[material fatigue]], a '''crack arrestor''' or '''rip-stop doubler''' is a structurally strong ring or strip of material which serves to contain stress cracking that could lead to catastrophic failure of a device.

The crack arrestor can be as simple as a thickened region of metal, or may be constructed of a [[laminated]] or [[woven]] material that can withstand deformation without failure.

Crack arrestors were used to reinforce the airplane hull of the [[de Havilland Comet]] following a series of catastrophic accidents related to structural design problems that were previously unknown.

==Building==

Digital Beijing is located on the northwest corner of the intersection of Beichen West, Anxiang North and Huizhong roads in the [[Olympic Green]] neighborhood of Beijing's [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]], a generally level area {{convert|10|km}} north of the [[Forbidden City]] on the city's central axis. Guihua Third Street is to the north, and Tianchen West Road is to the west. To the southeast is the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]], colloquially known as the Watercube, the venue for swimming and diving at the Olympics and now an indoor [[water park]]; the distinctive [[Beijing National Stadium]], or Birds' Nest, is to the east of the Aquatics Center. East of the building is the [[Beijing National Indoor Stadium]], where gymnastics and several other events were held. Another important Olympic venue, the [[China National Convention Center]], takes up several [[city block|blocks]] to the northeast.&lt;ref name="ACME Mapper"&gt;{{cite map |publisher=ACME Laboratories|map=8.3 km N of Beijing  |title=ACME Mapper|mapurl=http://mapper.acme.com/?ll=40.003031,116.386669&amp;z=15&amp;t=H |cartography=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directly to the south are several blocks of lightly planted [[urban open space|open space]] buffering the Aquatics Center from Beichen West. On the north a parking lot separates Digital Beijing from National Stadium Road and the [[InterContinental Hotels Group|InterContinental]] Beichen Beijing Hotel [[high-rise]] on the other side. The buildings of Science Park Nanli are across Beichen to the west, and the Pangu Seven-Star Hotel on the southwest corner of the intersection anchors the buildings of Pangu Plaza, which continue to the south along the west side of Beichen West.&lt;ref name="ACME Mapper" /&gt;

Water surrounds the building's {{convert|16000|m2|sqft}}&lt;ref name="HWM magazine" /&gt; on all sides but the east.&lt;ref name="Pei Zhu page" /&gt; It consists of four large narrow slabs 11 stories ({{convert|57|m}}) high&lt;ref name="DCK blog post" /&gt; but of varying thickness, with the easternmost thickest of all, with gaps between them, with the gap between the eastern slab and the others being wider. All are connected by [[pedestrian bridge]]s at various heights; those nearer each other have larger bridges, with the two on the west having a two-story glass [[hyphen (architecture)|hyphen]]. They are faced in a dark stone quarried in northern China,&lt;ref name="Galinsky page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Beijing, Beijing|url=http://www.galinsky.com/buildings/digitalbeijing/|publisher=Galinsky.com|date=2014|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some inserts of [[aluminum]] made to look like stone.&lt;ref name="Guardian article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Glancey|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Glancey|title=Secrets of the Bird's Nest|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/feb/11/architecture.chinaarts2008|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location= London|date=11 February 2008|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Once Beijing was awarded the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in 2001, planning began for the Games, and the [[Olympic Green]] area in the city's [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]] that would host the [[Beijing Olympic Village|Olympic Village]] and many major event venues. One theme of the Olympics was to be the "Digital Olympics", using more new [[information technology]] than had ever before been used in the Olympics. Early in 2002, the city's Municipal Informatization Office called for a "landmark building" to use as the main data center during the Games and for other, related purposes afterwards.&lt;ref name="Beijing MIO presentation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hua|first=Pinglan|title=Digital Beijing and Program of Action for Digital Olympics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pqBwIW5PE6gC&amp;pg=PT14|page=14|publisher=Beijing Municipal Informatization Office|date=10–12 January 2002|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contest was held, and the design by Pei Zhu, then with the Chinese firm Urbanus but in the process of setting up his own Pei Zhu Studio, was chosen from among eight competitors in 2004.&lt;ref name="Peter Rowe book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rowe|first1=Peter G.|title=Emergent Architectural Territories in East Asian Cities|date=2011|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|location=Berlin|isbn=9783034610599|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GeuaUWm7RbAC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DCK blog post" /&gt; It was the only major facility among the 31 new buildings to have been designed by a Chinese architect.&lt;ref name="Paul Goldberger book" /&gt; It was also the only Olympic Green building that was not an Olympic event venue.&lt;ref name="MSA page" /&gt;

"If the industrial revolution resulted in modernism, contemporary architecture needs to explore what will form out of the current revolution of information," Zhu wrote later. "Conceptually, Digital Beijing was developed through reconsideration and reflection on the role of [[Chinese architecture]] in the modern information era. [It] helps to develop a new aesthetic, an architectural language that is thoroughly contemporary, but retains a Chinese texture and sensibility."&lt;ref name="Pei Zhu page" /&gt;
[[File:数字北京大厦.JPG|thumb|left|South elevation, 2011, with "alternation between void and solid" visible|alt=A view of the building from a different angle, with the gaps between the slabs visible]]
To that end, the building he designed echoes the tools it was designed to house. From the ends it resembles a [[bar code]], rising from the water. Zhu explains:
{{quote|The abstracted mass of the building, reflecting [[Binary number|the simple repetition of 0 and 1]] in its alternation between void and solid, recreates on a monumental scale the microscopic underpinnings of life in the digital age to form a potent symbol of the Digital Olympics and the Digital Era ... The three bars that reflect the solid typology are physical manifestations of [[information technology]]. Inside are all of the computers and machines that make up the [[mainframe computer|mainframe]].&lt;ref name="Pei Zhu page" /&gt;}}
The east and west facades offer a contrast between the windowless western side, continuing to emphasize the building's contents and purpose by being decorated to resemble a [[Printed circuit board|circuit board]], and the open, glassy easy. This contrast of extremes, according to Zhu, is what the building draws from Chinese culture, specifically the ''[[hutong]]'', the narrow mazes of alleyways where much of Beijing's traditional street life and community took place. "On the exterior transparency is very rare, where internally the true interaction between nature, open space and building is most evident." He concludes "Through the perspective of Chinese philosophy, everything including the advancement of technology has an intimate connection with the natural realm. Aesthetically this perspective continues a dialogue between the past and the future."&lt;ref name="Pei Zhu page" /&gt;

Construction began in 2005.&lt;ref name="HWM magazine" /&gt; During that time Zhu and the builders were to take advantage of two newly developed materials. The first, a translucent [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber reinforced plastic]], had first been developed for a hotel Zhu was building elsewhere in Beijing as a substitute for [[jade]], which proved too expensive to use in the quantity he had wanted it. Since it held images projected in it well, he also decided to use it for the flooring inside Digital Beijing, where it could become a "digital carpet", similar to the "urban carpet" [[Zaha Hadid]] created for the [[Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. It was also strong enough to support the interior footbridges, so Zhu used it there too. On the exterior, a local maker of beverage cans developed the aluminum sheets for the building's facades that gleam in places yet still look like stone from far away.&lt;ref name="Architectural Record China" /&gt;

The building was completed and opened on 3 November 2007.&lt;ref name="tencent piece opening uuote"&gt;Tencent, "2007 年11月3 日，由中国建筑师朱锫设计的北京奥运控制中心“数字北京”，作为北京奥林匹克公园中心区第一个竣工验收并投入使用的项目，正式竣工投入使用。"&lt;/ref&gt; It served as the main data center during the Summer Games the following year, as intended (a backup was built in an undisclosed location&lt;ref name="HWM magazine" /&gt;). Since then it has served, also as planned, as a museum of the Digital Olympics and exhibition space, both concentrated in the public area of the building on the east, where the interior is visible. "Digital Beijing accepts this transformation with a capacity for constant renovation, sprinting along side the pace of our time," Zhu wrote.&lt;ref name="Pei Zhu page" /&gt;

==Reception==

The first public reaction from an architecture critic was positive. "If China has set out to impress the world with the 2008 Olympics," ''[[The Guardian]]'''s [[Jonathan Glancey]] wrote in February 2008, several months before the Games and two months after the building's completion, "the stadium and its attendant buildings—the Aquatics Centre and Digital Beijing (the Olympics 'command post')—have set a heady precedent." He contrasted them with the tepid reaction to building designs already unveiled for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London.&lt;ref name="Guardian article" /&gt;

Glancey likened the four upright slabs to "upright 1960s IBM computers" and praised Zhu's "creative use of unexpected materials". Unlike most other prominent contemporary Chinese architects, Zhu had, the critic noted, enjoyed the luxury of time in his work. "The result is delightful."&lt;ref name="Guardian article" /&gt;

However, a few months later, [[Tom Dyckhoff]] of ''[[The Times]]'' was not so impressed. He was the first Western journalist allowed to tour [[Olympic Green]], most of which was still under construction and surrounded with a {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} steel fence under military guard to block it from public view. While he had unmitigated praise for the [[Beijing National Stadium|Birds' Nest]], he considered the rest of the buildings "a flop". He described Digital Beijing as "chees[y] ... Four gloomy stone slabs, divided by glass atria, do an excellent [[George Orwell|Orwellian]] [[Ministry of Truth]] impression." He did allow that it was "slightly less spirit-crushing inside".&lt;ref name="Dyckhoff review" /&gt;

Dyckhoff's was the only prominent negative reaction. Two months after the Olympics, at that year's [[World Architecture Festival]], Digital Beijing was shortlisted in its category.&lt;ref name="Pei Zhu page" /&gt; The next year, former ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Paul Goldberger]] wrote in his book ''Building Up and Tearing Down: Reflection on the Age of Architecture'' that while, like the adjacent [[Water Cube]], Digital Beijing "steers dangerously close to a [[kitsch]]y conceit", it, too, succeeds. "The finished building has a dignity that is surprising ... an austerity that is the opposite of kitsch."&lt;ref name="Paul Goldberger book" /&gt;

In 2011 [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Harvard]] professor Peter G. Rowe wrote at length about Digital Beijing in ''Emergent Architectural Territories in East Asian Cities''. "Although hardly the fault of architecture under such a presumption,", he wrote of Zhu's stated aesthetic intentions for the building, "this sort of symbol may seem somewhat at odds with the dispersed and uniquitous character of today's digital media." Nevertheless, he continued, that may have been part of the building's point.
{{quote|[B]y calling such direct attention to this era in what will doubtless be a continuing information age, Studio Pei Zhu have perhaps marked the awkwardness, or uncertainty, many have about rapidly evolving technology today, and in a manner that might otherwise have gone unrecognized. Despite its literalness, the complex can also be seen as socially critical in this regard.&lt;ref name="Peter Rowe book" /&gt;}}

The '''Digital Humanities conference''' is an [[academic conference]] for the field of [[digital humanities]]. It is hosted by [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] and has been held annually since 1989.

==History==
The first joint conference was held in 1989, at the [[University of Toronto]]—but that was the 16th annual meeting of [[ALLC]], and the ninth annual meeting of the [[Association for Computers and the Humanities|ACH]]-sponsored International Conference on Computers and the Humanities (ICCH).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| title = Conference
| work = ADHO
| accessdate = 2012-02-12
| url = http://digitalhumanities.org/conference
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chronicle of Higher Education has called the conference "highly competitive" but "worth the price of admission," praising its participants' focus on best practices, the intellectual community it has fostered, and the tendency of its organizers to sponsor attendance of early-career scholars (important given the relative expense of attending it, as compared to other academic conferences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Eden Project''' ({{lang-kw|Edenva}}) is a popular visitor attraction in [[Cornwall]], England, UK. Inside the two biomes are plants that are collected from many diverse climates and environments. The project is located in a reclaimed [[china clay]] [[clay pit|pit]], located {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} from the town of [[St Blazey]] and {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the larger town of [[St Austell]].&lt;ref name="osexp1"&gt;Ordnance Survey (2005). ''OS Explorer Map 107 – Fowey, Looe &amp; Lostwithiel''. {{ISBN|0-319-23708-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex is dominated by two huge enclosures consisting of adjoining domes that house thousands of plant [[species]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edenproject.com/come-and-visit/whats-here/rainforest-biome/index.php | title = Rainforest Biome | publisher = Eden project | accessdate = 11 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and each enclosure emulates a natural [[biome]]. The biomes consist of hundreds of [[hexagon]]al and [[pentagon]]al, inflated, plastic cells supported by steel frames. The largest of the two biomes simulates a [[rainforest]] environment and the second, a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean environment]]. The attraction also has an outside [[botanical garden]] which is home to many plants and wildlife native to Cornwall and the UK in general; it also has many plants that provide an important and interesting backstory, for example, those with a prehistoric heritage.

== Design and construction ==
The project was conceived by [[Tim Smit]] and designed by architect [[Nicholas Grimshaw]] and engineering firm Anthony Hunt and Associates (now part of [[Sinclair Knight Merz]]). [[Davis Langdon]] carried out the project management, [[Sir Robert McAlpine]] and [[Alfred McAlpine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edenproject.com/whats-it-all-about/behind-the-scenes/our-history/index.php | title = Our history | publisher = Eden project | accessdate = 27 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; did the construction, [[Mero-Schmidlin|MERO]] designed and built the biomes, and [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] was the services engineer, economic consultant, environmental engineer and transportation engineer. [[Land use]] consultants led the masterplan and landscape design. The project took 2½ years to construct and opened to the public on 17 March 2001.

== Site ==

=== Layout ===
[[File:The Bee (Eden Project).JPG|thumb|''The Bee'']]
Once into the attraction, there is a meandering path with views of the two biomes, planted landscapes, including vegetable gardens, and sculptures that include a giant [[bee]] and previously The [[WEEE]] Man (removed in 2016), a towering figure made from old electrical appliances and was meant to represent the average electrical waste used by one person in a lifetime.

=== Biomes ===
At the bottom of the pit are two covered [[biome]]s:

The Tropical Biome, covers {{convert|1.56|ha|acre|1|abbr=on}} and measures {{convert|55|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long. It is used for tropical plants, such as fruiting banana plants, [[Coffea|coffee]], rubber and giant [[bamboo]], and is kept at a tropical temperature and moisture level.
[[File:The Tropical Biome.jpg|thumb|The Tropical Biome]]

The [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] Biome covers {{convert|0.654|ha|acre|1|abbr=on}} and measures {{convert|35|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|65|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|135|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long. It houses familiar warm [[temperate]] and [[arid]] plants such as [[olive]]s and grape [[vine]]s and various sculptures.

The Outdoor Gardens represent the temperate regions of the world with plants such as tea, [[lavender]], [[hops]], [[hemp]] and [[sunflower]]s, as well as local plant species.

The covered biomes are constructed from a tubular steel (hex-tri-hex) with mostly hexagonal external cladding panels made from the thermoplastic [[ETFE]]. Glass was avoided due to its weight and potential dangers. The cladding panels themselves are created from several layers of thin [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-transparent ETFE [[Tensile structure|film]], which are sealed around their [[perimeter]] and inflated to create a large cushion. The resulting cushion acts as a thermal blanket to the structure. The ETFE material is resistant to most stains, which simply wash off in the rain. If required, cleaning can be performed by [[abseil]]ers. Although the ETFE is susceptible to punctures, these can be easily fixed with ETFE tape. The structure is completely self-supporting, with no internal supports, and takes the form of a [[geodesic dome|geodesic]] structure. The panels vary in size up to {{convert|9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} across, with the largest at the top of the structure.

The ETFE technology was supplied and installed by the firm [[Vector Foiltec]], which is also responsible for ongoing maintenance of the cladding. The steel spaceframe and cladding package (with Vector Foiltec as ETFE subcontractor) was designed, supplied and installed by MERO (UK) PLC, who also jointly developed the overall scheme geometry with the architect, Nicholas Grimshaw &amp; Partners.

The entire build project was managed by McAlpine Joint Venture.

=== The Core ===
[[File:The Core, Eden Project.JPG|thumb|The Core]]
The Core is the latest addition to the site and opened in September 2005. It provides the Eden Project with an education facility, incorporating classrooms and exhibition spaces designed to help communicate Eden's central message about the relationship between people and plants. Accordingly, the building has taken its inspiration from plants, most noticeable in the form of the soaring timber roof, which gives the building its distinctive shape.

Grimshaw developed the geometry of the copper-clad roof in collaboration with a sculptor, Peter Randall-Page, and Mike Purvis of structural engineers [[Sinclair Knight Merz|SKM Anthony Hunts]]. It is derived from [[phyllotaxis]], which is the mathematical basis for nearly all plant growth; the "opposing spirals" found in many plants such as the seeds in a sunflower's head, [[pine cone]]s and [[pineapple]]s. The copper was obtained from traceable sources, and the Eden Project is working with [[Rio Tinto Group]] to explore the possibility of encouraging further traceable supply routes for metals, which would enable users to avoid metals mined unethically. The services and [[Acoustics|acoustic]], mechanical and electrical engineering design was carried out by [[Buro Happold]].

==== Art at The Core ====
[[File:The Seed at Eden Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright=0.6|''Seed'' by Peter Randall-Page]]
The Core is also home to art exhibitions throughout the year. A permanent installation entitled ''Seed'', by [[Peter Randall-Page]], occupies the anteroom. ''Seed'' is a large, 70 tonne egg-shaped stone installation standing some {{convert|13|ft}} tall and displaying a complex pattern of protrusions that are based upon the [[Fibonacci number#In nature|geometric and mathematical principles that underlie plant growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Granite seed is 'planted' at Eden | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 2007-06-11 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6738783.stm | access-date = 2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edenproject.com/visit/whats-here/seed-sculpture | title = Seed sculpture by Peter Randall-Page | publisher = Eden Project | access-date = 2018-02-25 | quote = Made out of a single piece of granite, its surface has been carved with 1,800 nodes in the pattern of a Fibonacci spiral – the growth pattern found across the natural world in things like sunflowers, pine cones and ammonites}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental aspects ==
[[File:Cornwall, eden project tropical.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the tropical Biome]]
The domes provide diverse growing conditions, and many plants are on display.

The Eden Project includes [[environmental education]] focusing on the interdependence of plants and people; plants are labelled with their medicinal uses. The massive amounts of water required to create the humid conditions of the Tropical Biome, and to serve the toilet facilities, are all sanitised rain water that would otherwise collect at the bottom of the quarry. The only [[Public utility|mains]] water used is for hand washing and for cooking. The complex also uses Green Tariff Electricity – the energy comes from one of the many [[wind turbine]]s in Cornwall, which were among the first in Europe.

Controversially, one of the companies the Eden Project currently partners with is the British mining company Rio Tinto Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edenproject.com/media/mining-book-pr.php|title=New Eden Project book shows what can be done with disused mines|publisher=Eden project}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}

In December 2010 the Eden Project received permission to build a [[geothermal electricity]] plant which will generate approx 4MWe, enough to supply Eden and about 5000 households.&lt;ref name="BBC Geotherm"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-12026753|title=BBC News – Eden Project geothermal plant plans to go ahead |publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=18 December 2010|date=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial idea for the project dates back to 1996, with construction beginning in 1998. The work was hampered by torrential rain in the first few months of the project, and parts of the pit flooded as it sits {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the water table.&lt;ref name="edenproject.com" /&gt;

The first part of the Eden Project, the visitor centre, opened to the public in May 2000. The first plants began arriving in September of that year,&lt;ref name="edenproject.com" /&gt; and the full site opened on 17 March 2001.

The Eden Project was used as a filming location for the 2002 [[James Bond]] film, ''[[Die Another Day]]''. On 2 July 2005 The Eden Project hosted the [[Live 8 concert, Eden Project|"Africa Calling" concert]] of the [[Live 8]] concert series.  It has also provided some plants for the [[British Museum]]'s Africa garden.

In 2005, the Project launched "A Time of Gifts" for the winter months, November to February. This features an ice rink covering the lake, with a small café/bar attached, as well as a Christmas market. Cornish choirs regularly perform in the biomes.

On 6 December 2007, the Eden Project invited people all over Cornwall to try to break the [[world record]] for the biggest ever [[pub quiz]] as part of its campaign to bring £50 million of [[lottery]] funds to Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edenproject.com/about/3200.html |title=About |publisher=Eden Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226181304/http://www.edenproject.com/about/3200.html |archivedate=26 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, the project failed in its bid for £50 million of funding, after the [[Big Lottery Fund]] popular vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7140621.stm | publisher= BBC News | date= 12 December 2007 | title= Routes scheme tops lottery vote | accessdate= 3 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
when it received just 12.07% of the votes, the lowest for the four projects being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/prog_the_peoples_50_million.htm | publisher= The Big Lottery Fund | title= The People's 50 Million – Sustrans' Connect2 wins £50 million prize | accessdate= 3 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eden wanted the money for Edge, a proposed [[desert]] biome that was going to look at people and plants living on the edge today and the solutions that they have come up with to the challenge of living within limits.&lt;ref name=BigLottery&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/global-content/press-releases/england/south-west/eden-edges-closer-to-winning-lottery-millions | title=Eden edges closer to winning Lottery millions: Big Lottery Fund |accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, much of the project, including both greenhouses, became available to navigate through [[Google Street View]].

The Eden Trust revealed a trading loss of £1.3 million for 2012-13, on a turnover of £25.4 million. The Eden Project had posted a surplus of £136,000 for the previous year. In 2014 Eden accounts showed a surplus of £2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornishguardian.co.uk/St-Austell-8217-s-Eden-Project-black/story-21239280-detail/story.html#ixzz3df3N6sV2|title=St Austell’s Eden Project|date=15 June 2014|publisher=[[Cornish Guardian]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210710/http://www.cornishguardian.co.uk/St-Austell-8217-s-Eden-Project-black/story-21239280-detail/story.html#ixzz3df3N6sV2|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pasty Championships]] have been held at the Eden Project since 2012, an international competition to find the best [[Cornish pasties]] and other pasty-type savoury snacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|World Pasty Championships winners chosen}}

The Eden Project is said to have contributed over £1 billion to the Cornish economy.&lt;ref name=personally&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.personallyspeakingbureau.com/speaker/tim-smit-kbe-sir/ | title=Tim Smit KBE, Sir – Personally Speaking Bureau |accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eden Project received 1,024,156 visitors in 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALVA - Association of Leading Visitor Attractions|url=http://www.alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=423|website=www.alva.org.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EuroFIR''' (European Food Information Resource) is a non-profit international Association, which supports use of existing [[food composition data]] and future resources through cooperation and harmonization of data quality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = S | last2 = Pakkala | first2 = H | last3 = Finglas | first3 = MP | date = Jun 2012 | title = Towards a European food composition data interchange platform | url = | journal = Int J Vitam Nutr Res. | volume = 82 | issue = 3| pages = 209–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; functionality and global standards.

The purpose of the Association is the development, management, publication and exploitation of [[food composition data]], and the promotion of international cooperation and harmonization through improved data quality, [[FCDB|food composition database]] searchability and standards, for example, with the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) on the standard for food data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Becker | first1 = W | date = Nov 2010 | title = CEN/TC387 Food Data (2010) Towards a CEN Standard on food data | url = | journal = Eur J Clin Nutr. | volume = 64 | issue = Suppl 3| pages = S49–52 | doi = 10.1038/ejcn.2010.210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other work includes that on ethnic &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Khokhar | first1 = S | last2 = Garduño-Diaz | first2 = SD | last3 = Marletta | first3 = L | last4 = Shahar | first4 = DR | last5 = Ireland | first5 = JD | last6 = Jansen- | first6 =  | last7 = van der Vliet | first7 = M | last8 = de Henauw | first8 = S | year = 2012 | title = Mineral composition of commonly consumed ethnic foods in Europe | url = | journal = Food Nutr Res. | volume = 56 | issue = | page = | doi = 10.3402/fnr.v56i0.17665 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and traditional foods &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costa | first1 = HS | last2 = Vasilopoulou | first2 = E | last3 = Trichopoulou | first3 = A | last4 = Finglas | first4 = P | last5 = Participants | first5 =  | last6 = EuroFIR Traditional | first6 = Foods Work Package | year = 2010 | title = New nutritional data on traditional foods for European food composition databases | url = | journal = Eur J Clin Nutr. | volume = 64 | issue = Suppl 3| pages = S73–81 | doi = 10.1038/ejcn.2010.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and critical evaluation of data on nutrients &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bouckaert | first1 = KP | last2 = Slimani | first2 = N | last3 = Nicolas | first3 = G | last4 = Vignat | first4 = J | last5 = Wright | first5 = AJ | last6 = Roe | first6 = M | last7 = Witthöft | first7 = CM | last8 = Finglas | first8 = PM | year = 2011 | title = Critical evaluation of folate data in European and international databases: recommendations for standardization in international nutritional studies | url = | journal = Mol Nutr Food Res | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 166–80 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201000391 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2081">In [[mathematics]], in particular [[numerical analysis]], the '''FETI''' method ('''finite element tearing and interconnect''') is an [[iterative substructuring]] method for solving [[systems of linear equations]] from the [[finite element method]] for the solution of [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s, in particular in [[computational mechanics]]&lt;ref&gt;C. Farhat and F. X. Roux, A method of finite element tearing and interconnecting and its parallel solution algorithm, Internat. J. Numer. Meths. Engrg. 32, 1205-1227 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In each iteration, FETI requires the solution of a [[Neumann problem]] in each substructure and the solution of a [[coarse problem]]. The simplest version of FETI with no preconditioner (or only a diagonal preconditioner) in the substructure is scalable with the number of substructures&lt;ref&gt;Charbel Farhat, Jan Mandel, and François-Xavier Roux, Optimal convergence properties of the FETI domain decomposition method, Comput. Meth. Appl. Mech. Engrg. 115(1994)365-385&lt;/ref&gt; but the condition number grows polynomially with the number of elements per [[Substructure (mathematics)|substructure]]. FETI with a (more expensive) preconditioner consisting of the solution of a [[Dirichlet problem]] in each substructure is scalable with the number of substructures and its condition number grows only polylogarithmically with the number of elements per substructure.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mandel and R. Tezaur, On the Convergence of a Substructuring Method with Lagrange multipliers, Numerische Mathematik 73 (1996) 473-487&lt;/ref&gt; The [[coarse problem|coarse space]] in FETI consists of the [[nullspace]] on each substructure.

The '''Franz–Keldysh effect''' is a change in [[optical absorption]] by a [[semiconductor]] when an [[electric field]] is applied.  The effect is named after the German physicist [[Walter Franz]] and Russian physicist [[Leonid Keldysh]] (nephew of [[Mstislav Keldysh]]).

Karl W. Böer observed first the shift of the optical [[absorption edge]] with electric fields &lt;ref&gt;K. W. Böer, H. J. Hänsch, and U. Kümmel, Naturwiss. 19, 460 (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; during the discovery of high-field domains&lt;ref&gt;Karl W. Böer Monatsber. Deutsch.Akad. d.Wissensch. 1,272 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; and named this the Franz-effect.&lt;ref&gt;Karl W. Böer Z. für Physik, 155,184 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, when the English translation of the Keldysh paper became available, he corrected this to the Franz–Keldysh effect.&lt;ref&gt;Karl W. Böer H.J. Hänsch and U. Kümmel Zeitschr. für Physik 155, 170 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

As originally conceived, the Franz–Keldysh effect is the result of [[wavefunction]]s "leaking" into the band gap. When an electric field is applied, the [[electron]] and [[electron hole|hole]] wavefunctions become [[Airy function]]s rather than plane waves. The Airy function includes a "tail" which extends into the classically forbidden band gap. According to [[Fermi's Golden Rule]], the more overlap there is between the wavefunctions of a free electron and a hole, the stronger the optical absorption will be. The Airy tails slightly overlap even if the electron and hole are at slightly different potentials (slightly different physical locations along the field). The absorption spectrum now includes a tail at energies below the band gap and some oscillations above it. This explanation does, however, omit the effects of [[exciton]]s, which may dominate optical properties near the band gap.

The Franz–Keldysh effect occurs in uniform, bulk semiconductors, unlike the [[quantum-confined Stark effect]], which requires a quantum well. Both are used for [[Electro-absorption modulator]]s. The Franz–Keldysh effect usually requires hundreds of [[volt]]s, limiting its usefulness with conventional electronics – although this is not the case for commercially available Franz–Keldysh-effect electro-absorption modulators that use a waveguide geometry to guide the optical carrier.

== Effect on modulation spectroscopy ==
The [[absorption coefficient]] is related to the [[dielectric constant]] (especially the complex term). From Maxwell's equation, we can easily find out the relation,

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{2\omega k_0} {c}={{\omega\kappa_2} \over{n_0c}}.&lt;/math&gt;

We will consider the direct transition of an electron from the valence band to the [[conduction band]] induced by the [[Ray (optics)|incident light]] in a [[perfect crystal]] and try to take into account of the change of absorption coefficient for each Hamiltonian with a probable interaction like electron-photon, electron-hole, external field. These approach follows from.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;C. Hamaguchi, "Basic Semiconductor Physics", Springer (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; We put the 1st purpose on the theoretical background of Franz–Keldysh effect and third-derivative modulation spectroscopy.

===One electron Hamiltonian with EM (electro magnetic) field===
&lt;math&gt;H = {1 \over 2m} (p+eA)^2 + V(r)&lt;/math&gt; (A: [[vector potential]], V(r): periodic potential)

&lt;math&gt;A = {1 \over 2} A_0 e [e^{i(k_p \cdot r - \omega t)}+e^{-i(k_p \cdot r - \omega t)}]&lt;/math&gt;
(k&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and e are the wave vector of em field and [[unit vector]].)

Neglecting the square term &lt;math&gt;A^2&lt;/math&gt; and using the relation &lt;math&gt;A\cdot p  = p \cdot A&lt;/math&gt; within the Coulomb gauge &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot A=0&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain

&lt;math&gt;H \sim {p^2 \over 2m} + V(r) + {e \over m} A \cdot p&lt;/math&gt;

Then using the [[Bloch wave|Bloch function]] &lt;math&gt;|jk\rangle = e^{ik \cdot r} u_{jk}(r)&lt;/math&gt; (j= v, c that mean valence band, conduction band)

the transition probability can be obtained such that

&lt;math&gt;w_{cv} = {2 \pi \over \hbar} |\langle ck'| {e \over m} A \cdot p |vk\rangle|^2\delta[\Epsilon _c (k') - \Epsilon _v (k) - \hbar \omega]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;= {\pi e^2 \over 2 \hbar m^2}A_0 ^2 |\langle ck'|exp(ik_p \cdot r)e \cdot p |vk\rangle |^2 \delta[\Epsilon _c (k') - \Epsilon _v (k) - \hbar \omega]&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;k_p&lt;/math&gt; means [[wave vector]] of light)
&lt;math&gt;e \cdot p_{cv} = {1 \over V} \int_v e^{i(k_p +k-k') \cdot r} {u^*}_{ck'}(r)e \cdot (p+ \hbar k)u_{vk} (r) d^3r&lt;/math&gt;

Power dissipation of the [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] per unit time and unit volume gives rise to following equation

&lt;math&gt;\hbar \omega w_{cv} = {1 \over 2} \omega \kappa_2 \epsilon_0 {E_0}^2&lt;/math&gt;

From the relation between the [[electric field]] and the vector potential, &lt;math&gt;{E} = -{{\partial A} \over {\partial t}}&lt;/math&gt;, we may put &lt;math&gt;E_0 = \omega A_0&lt;/math&gt;

And finally we can get the imaginary part of the dielectric constant and surely the absorption coefficient.
&lt;math&gt;\kappa = {{\pi e^2} \over {\epsilon_0 m^2 \omega^2}}\sum_{k,k'} |e \cdot p_{cv}|^2 \delta[\Epsilon _c (k') - \Epsilon _v (k) - \hbar \omega]\delta_{kk'} &lt;/math&gt;

===2-body(electron-hole) Hamiltonian with EM field===
An electron in the [[valence band]](wave vector k) is excited by photon absorption into the conduction band(the wave vector at the band is &lt;math&gt;k'=k_e&lt;/math&gt;) and leaves a hole in the valence band(the wave vector of the hole is &lt;math&gt;k_h=-k&lt;/math&gt;). In this case, we include the electron-hole interaction.(&lt;math&gt;V(r_e -r_h)&lt;/math&gt;)

Thinking about the direct transition, &lt;math&gt;|k_e|, |k_h|&lt;/math&gt; is almost same. But Assume the slight difference of the momentum due to the photon absorption is not ignored and the bound state- electron-hole pair is very weak and the [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] approximation is valid for the treatment. Then we can make up the following procedure, the wave function and wave vectors of the electron and hole

&lt;math&gt; \Psi_{ij} (r_e, r_h) = \psi_{ik_e}(r_e) \psi_{jk_h} (r_h)&lt;/math&gt; (i, j are the band indices, and r&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; are the coordinates and wave vectors of the electron and hole respectively)

And we can take a total wave vector '''K''' such that

&lt;math&gt;K = k_e + k_h.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;H=H_e + H_h +V(r_e -r_h)&lt;/math&gt;

Then, Bloch functions of the electron and hole can be constructed with the phase term &lt;math&gt;A^{n,K}_{cv}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Psi^{n,K}(r_e,r_h) = \sum_{c,k_e,v,k_h}A^{n,K}_{cv}(k_e,k_h) \psi_{ck_e}(r_e) \psi_{vk_h} (r_h)&lt;/math&gt;

If V slowly over the distance of the integral, the term can be treated like following.

&lt;math&gt;[\Epsilon_c(k_e) + \Epsilon_h(k_h)+V(r_e-r_h)-\epsilon]A^{n,K}_{c,V}(k_e,k_h) =0(*)&lt;/math&gt;

here we assume that the conduction and valence bands are parabolic with scalar masses and that at the top of the valence band &lt;math&gt;\Epsilon_v =0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.
&lt;math&gt;\Epsilon_c(k_e) = {{\hbar^2k_e^2} \over {2m_e}}+\Epsilon_G, \Epsilon_h(k_h)={{\hbar^2k_h^2} \over {2m_h}}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\Epsilon_G&lt;/math&gt; is the energy gap)

Now, The [[Fourier transform]] of &lt;math&gt;A^{n,K}_{cv}(k_e,k_h)&lt;/math&gt; and above (*), the effective mass equation for the exciton may be written as

&lt;math&gt;[(-{\hbar^2 \over 2M}\nabla^2)+(-{\hbar^2 \over 2\mu} \nabla^2-{e^2 \over 4\pi\epsilon r})]\Phi^{n,k}(r,R) = [\Epsilon-\Epsilon_G] \cdot \Phi^{n,K}(r,R)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r=r_e-r_h, R={{m_e r_e + m_h r_h}\over {m_e+m_h}}, {1 \over \mu} = {1\over m_e}+{1 \over m_h}, M= m_e + m_h &lt;/math&gt;

then the solution of eq is given by

&lt;math&gt;\Psi^{n,K} (r,R) = \Psi_K(R)\psi_n(r)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Psi^{n,K} (r,R) = {1 \over \sqrt {V}}exp(iK \cdot R) \phi_n(r)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\phi_n(r)&lt;/math&gt; is called the envelope function of an exciton. The ground state of the exciton is given in analogy to the [[hydrogen atom]].

then, the [[dielectric function]] is

&lt;math&gt;\kappa_2(\omega) = {\pi e^2 \over{\epsilon_0 m^2 \omega^2}} |e \cdot p_{cv}|^2\sum_{\lambda} |\phi_\lambda(0)|^2 \delta(\Epsilon_G + \Epsilon_\lambda - \hbar\omega)(**) &lt;/math&gt;

detailed calculation is in.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Franz–Keldysh effect means an electron in a valence band can be allowed to be excited into a conduction band by absorbing a photon with its energy below the band gap. Now we're thinking about the effective mass equation for the [[Kinematics|relative motion]] of [[electron hole]] pair when the external field is applied to a crystal. But we are not to take a mutual potential of electron-hole pair into the Hamiltonian.

When the Coulomb interaction is neglected, the effective mass equation is

&lt;math&gt;[-{\hbar^2 \over 2\mu} \nabla^2 - eE \cdot r ] \psi(r) = \epsilon \psi(r)&lt;/math&gt;.

And the equation can be expressed,

&lt;math&gt;[-{\hbar^2 \over 2\mu}{d^2 \over {dr_i^2}}-eE_ir_i-\epsilon_i]\psi(r_i) = 0&lt;/math&gt;( where &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; is the value in the direction of the principal axis of the reduced effective mass tensor)

Using change of variables:

&lt;math&gt;\hbar\theta_i = ({{e^2E_i^2\hbar^2} \over {2\mu_i}})^{1/3}, \xi_i={{\epsilon_i+eE_ir_i}\over{\hbar\theta_i}} &lt;/math&gt;

then the solution is

&lt;math&gt;\psi(\xi_x,\xi_y,\xi_z)=C_x C_y C_z Ai(-\xi_x)Ai(-\xi_y)Ai(-\xi_z)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_i = {{\sqrt{e|E_i|}}\over{\hbar\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, &lt;math&gt;E_y=E_z=0, E_x&lt;/math&gt; the solution is given by

&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,y,z)=C \cdot Ai({{-eEx-\epsilon+\hbar^2k_y^2/2\mu_y + \hbar^2k_z^2/2\mu_z} \over {\hbar\theta_x}})&lt;/math&gt;

The dielectric constant can be obtained inserting this equation to the (**) (above block), and changing the summation with respect to λ to &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}d\epsilon_xd\epsilon_yd\epsilon_z&lt;/math&gt;

The integral with respect to &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_x d\epsilon_y&lt;/math&gt; is given by the joint [[density of states]] for the two-D band. (the Joint density of states is nothing but the meaning of DOS of both electron and hole at the same time.)

&lt;math&gt;{\kappa(\omega, E)} = {{\pi^2} \over{\epsilon_0 m^2 \omega^2}}|e \cdot p_cv|^2 {{e|E_x|} \over {\hbar\theta_x^2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{J^{2D}}_{cv}(\hbar\omega - \epsilon_G - \epsilon_x) \cdot|Ai(-{{\epsilon_x} \over {\hbar\theta}})^2 |d\epsilon_x.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J^{2D}_{cv}(\hbar\omega) = {(\mu_y\mu_z)^{1/2} \over \pi\hbar^2}, \hbar\omega &gt; \epsilon_G. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=0, \hbar\omega &lt; \epsilon_G.&lt;/math&gt;

Then we put &lt;math&gt;\eta = {{\hbar\omega - \epsilon_G} \over {\hbar\theta_x}}&lt;/math&gt;

And think about the case we find &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;&lt;0 &lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;\hbar\omega &lt;&lt; \epsilon_G&lt;/math&gt; with the asymptotic solution for the [[Airy function]] in this limit.

Finally,&lt;math&gt;\kappa _2(\omega, E_x) = {1/2}\kappa_2(\omega)exp[{-4 \over 3}({{\epsilon_G-\hbar\omega} \over {\hbar\theta_x}})]&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the dielectric function for the [[Photon|incident photon]] energy below the band gap exist! These results indicate that absorption occurs for an incident photon.

A '''funicular''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|n|ɪ|k|j|ʊ|l|ər}}) is one of the modes of transportation which uses a cable traction for movement on steep [[grade (slope)|inclined slopes]].&lt;ref name=Giessbach&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Who%20We%20Are/Engineering%20History/Landmarks/259-Bro-Standseilbahn.pdf |title=The Giessbach Funicular with the World’s First Abt Switch |edition= |authors= |date=2015 |publisher=The [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]]|place=|isbn= |page=|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A funicular railway employs a pair of passenger vehicles which are pulled on a slope by the same cable which loops over a pulley wheel at the upper end of a track. The vehicles are permanently attached to the ends of the cable and counterbalance each other. They move synchronously: while one vehicle is ascending, the other one is descending the track. These particularities distinguish funiculars from other types of cable railways. For example, a funicular is distinguished from an [[inclined elevator]] by the presence of two vehicles which counterbalance each other.&lt;ref name="TCQSM"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.nap.edu/read/24766/chapter/1 |title=Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual.

The name "funicular" itself is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''{{wikt-lang|la|funiculus}}'', the diminutive of {{wikt-lang|la|funis}}, which translates as "rope".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/funicular|title=funicular|website=Oxford Dictionaries|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
The basic idea of funicular operation is that two cars are always attached to each other by a cable, which runs through a [[pulley]] at the top of the slope. Counterbalancing of the two cars, with one going up and one going down, minimizes the energy needed to lift the car going up. Winching is normally done by an electric drive that turns the [[pulley]]. Sheave wheels guide the cable to and from the drive mechanism and the [[slope car]]s.

=== Track layout ===
[[File:Funicular layouts.svg|thumb|left|Illustration of four-rail, three-rail and two-rail layouts. Rails coloured green are shared by both cars. Note the ''unconventional 'double flanged' wheels'' and the gaps ([[Points (rail)|points]]) in the rails in the two-rail layout.]]

[[File:Cape Point Passing Track.JPG|thumb|right|Passing track with Abt switch on the [[Flying Dutchman Funicular]] at [[Cape Point]], South Africa]]
[[File:Funiculaire, Vieux-Quebec (14808597653).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Quebec City|Québec]] ''funiculaire'', linking the high and low towns (haute-ville and basse-ville), Québec, Canada]]

Early funiculars used two parallel straight tracks, four rails, with separate station platforms for each vehicle. The tracks are laid with sufficient space between them for the two cars to pass at the midpoint. Three-rail arrangement was also used to overcome the half-way passing problem.&lt;ref name=Giessbach /&gt;

The wheels of the cars are usually single-[[flanged]], as on standard railway vehicles. Examples of this type of track layout are the [[Duquesne Incline]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and most cliff railways in the UK.

The Swiss engineer [[Carl Roman Abt]] invented the method that allows cars to be used with a two-rail configuration: the outboard wheels have flanges on both sides, which keeps them aligned with the outer rail, thus holding each car in position, whereas the inboard wheels are unflanged and ride on top of the opposite rail, thereby easily crossing over the rails (and cable) at the passing track.&lt;ref name=Giessbach /&gt;

Two-rail configurations of this type avoid the need for switches and crossings, since the cars have the flanged wheels on opposite sides and will automatically follow different tracks, and in general, significantly reduce costs.

In layouts using three rails, the middle rail is shared by both cars. The three-rail layout is wider than the two-rail layout, but the passing section is simpler to build. If a rack for braking is used, that rack can be mounted higher in a three-rail layout, making it less sensitive to choking in snowy conditions.&lt;ref name="hefti" /&gt;

Some four-rail funiculars have the upper and lower sections interlaced and a single platform at each station. The Hill Train at [[Legoland, Windsor]], is an example of this configuration.

The track layout can also be changed during the renovation of a funicular, and often four-rail layouts have been rebuilt as two- or three-rail layouts; e.g., the [[Wellington Cable Car]] in New Zealand was rebuilt with two rails.

=== Bottom towrope ===
The cars can be attached to a second cable running through a pulley at the bottom of the incline in case the gravity force acting on the vehicles is too low to operate them on the slope. One of the pulleys must be designed as a tensioning wheel to avoid slack in the ropes. In this case, the winching can also be done at the lower end of the incline. This practice is used for funiculars with gradients below 6%, funiculars using sledges instead of cars, or any other case where it is not ensured that the descending car is always able to pull out the cable from the pulley in the station on the top of the incline.&lt;ref name="hefti"&gt;Walter Hefti: ''Schienenseilbahnen in aller Welt. Schiefe Seilebenen, Standseilbahnen, Kabelbahnen.'' Birkhäuser, Basel 1975, {{ISBN|3-7643-0726-9}} (German)&lt;/ref&gt;
Another reason for a bottom cable is that the cable supporting the lower car at the extent of its travel will potentially weigh several tons, whereas that supporting the upper car weighs virtually nothing.  The lower cable adds an equal amount of cable weight to the upper car while deducting the same weight from the lower, thereby keeping the cars in equilibrium.

=== Water counterbalancing ===
[[File:Funiculaire Fribourg 119.JPG|thumb|Waste water – powered funicular ''Neuveville — St-Pierre'' in Fribourg (Switzerland)]]
A few funiculars have been built using water tanks under the floor of each car that are filled or emptied until just sufficient imbalance is achieved to allow movement. The car at the top of the hill is loaded with water until it is heavier than the car at the bottom, causing it to descend the hill and pulling up the other car. The water is drained at the bottom, and the process repeats with the cars exchanging roles. The movement is controlled by a [[brakeman]].

The [[Giessbachbahn]] in the [[Swiss]] [[canton of Berne]], opened in 1879, originally was powered by water ballast. Later on it was converted to electrical power. The [[Bom Jesus funicular]] built in 1882 near [[Braga]], [[Portugal]] is another example.

== History ==
[[File:Vesuvio, funicolare 4.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Vesuvius funicular, year unknown.]]

Funicular railways operating in urban areas date from the 1860s. The first line of the [[Funiculars of Lyon]] (Funiculaires de Lyon) opened in 1862, followed by other lines in 1878, 1891 and 1900. The [[Budapest Castle Hill Funicular]] was built in 1868–69, with the first test run on 23 October 1869. In Istanbul, Turkey, the [[Tünel]] has been in continuous operation since 1875 and is both the first underground funicular and the second-oldest underground railway. The oldest funicular railway operating in Britain dates from 1875 and is in Scarborough, North Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/8017535.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Blunder traps eight on cliff lift | date=24 April 2009 | accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the 1870s, the four-rail parallel-track funicular was the normal configuration. [[Carl Roman Abt]] developed the Abt Switch allowing the two-rail layout, which was used for the first time in 1879 when the [[Giessbach Funicular]] opened in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="hefti" /&gt; 

In the United States, the first funicular to use a two-rail layout was the [[Telegraph Hill Railroad]] in San Francisco, which was in operation from 1884 until 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telegraph Hill Railroad|url=http://www.cable-car-guy.com/html/ccsf.html#thrr|date=1 July 2009|work=The Cable Car Home Page – Cable Car Lines in San Francisco|publisher=Joe Thompson|accessdate=20 September 2009|quote=The Telegraph Hill Railroad was not a cable car line ...; it was a funicular railway}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mount Lowe Railway]] in Altadena, California, was the first [[mountain railway]] in the United States to use the three-rail layout. Three- and two-rail layouts considerably reduced the space required for building a funicular, reducing grading costs on mountain slopes and property costs for urban funiculars. These layouts enabled a funicular boom in the latter half of the 19th century.

In 1880 the funicular of [[Mount Vesuvius]] inspired the song ''[[Funiculì, Funiculà]]'', composed by [[Luigi Denza]] and lyrics by [[Peppino Turco]]. Unfortunately, this funicular was wrecked repeatedly by volcanic eruptions and abandoned after the eruption of 1944.

[[Valparaiso]] in Chile, used to have up to [[Funicular railways of Valparaíso|30 ''funicular elevators'']] ({{lang-es|ascensores}}), the oldest dating from 1883. Only 15 of them have remained in the city. Nearly half of them are in operation, although the authorities are making some efforts to restore the others remained into a working condition.

The [[Carmelit]] in [[Haifa]], Israel, with its 6 stations and a tunnel 1.8&amp;nbsp;km (1.1&amp;nbsp;mi) long is claimed by the [[Guinness World Records]] as the "least extensive [[Rapid transit|metro]]" in the world.

In [[computer science]], '''garbage''' includes [[object (computer science)|object]]s, [[data]], or other regions of the memory of a computer system (or other system resources), which will not be used in any future computation by the system, or by a program running on it. As computer systems all have finite amounts of memory, it is frequently necessary to ''deallocate'' garbage and return it to the [[Dynamic memory allocation|heap]], or memory pool, so the underlying memory can be reused.

== {{Anchor|semantic garbage|syntactic garbage}}Classification ==
Garbage is generally classified into two types: '''semantic garbage''' that is any object or data never accessed by a running program for any combination of program inputs, and '''syntactic garbage''' that refers to objects or data within a program's memory space but unreachable from the program's [[root set]].  Objects and/or data which are not garbage are said to be ''live''.

Casually stated, syntactic garbage is data that ''cannot'' be reached, while semantic garbage is data that ''will not'' be reached. More precisely, syntactic garbage is data that is unreachable due to the reference graph (there is no path to it), which can be determined by many algorithms, as discussed in [[tracing garbage collector]] and only requires analyzing the data, not the code. Semantic garbage is data that will not be accessed, either because it is unreachable (hence also syntactic garbage), or reachable but will not be accessed; this latter requires analysis of the code, and is in general an [[undecidable problem]].

Syntactic garbage is a (usually strict) subset of semantic garbage as it is entirely possible for an object to hold a reference to another object without the latter object being used.

==Example==
In the following simple stack implementation in Java, elements popped from the stack become semantic garbage once there are no outside references to them:{{efn|Simplified from ''[[Effective Java]]'' Item 6 by omitting resizing and explicit exceptions.}}
&lt;source lang="Java"&gt;
public class Stack {
  private Object[] elements;
  private int size;

  public Stack(int capacity) {
    elements = new Object[capacity];
  }
  public void push(Object e) {
    elements[size++] = e;
  }
  public Object pop() {
    return elements[size--];
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This is because there is still a reference to the object from &lt;code&gt;elements&lt;/code&gt;, but the object will never be accessed again through this reference, since &lt;code&gt;elements&lt;/code&gt; is private to the class and the &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; method only returns references to elements it has not already popped (once &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; is decremented, that element will never be accessed again by this class). However, this requires analysis of the code of the class, which is undecidable in general.

If a later &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; call re-grows the stack to the previous size, overwriting this last reference, then the object will become syntactic garbage, since it is unreachable, and will be eligible for garbage collection.

===Automatic garbage collection===
An example of the automatic collection of syntactic garbage, by [[reference counting]] garbage collection, can be produced using the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] command-line [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(object):
...     'This is an empty testing class.'
...     pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar
&lt;__main__.Foo object at 0x54f30&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; del bar
&lt;/source&gt;

In this session, an object is created, its location in the memory is displayed, and the only reference to the object is then destroyed—there is no way to ever use the object again from this point on, as there are no references to it. This becomes apparent when we try to access the original reference:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
NameError: name 'bar' is not defined
&lt;/source&gt;

As it is impossible to refer to the object, it has become useless: the object is garbage. Since Python uses garbage collection, it automatically deallocates the memory that was used for the object so that it may be used again:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar(object):
...     'This is another testing class.'
...     pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; baz = Bar()
&gt;&gt;&gt; baz
&lt;__main__.Bar object at 0x54f30&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt; instance now resides at the memory location &lt;tt&gt;0x54f30&lt;/tt&gt;; at the same place as where our previous object, the &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; instance, was located. Since the &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; instance was destroyed, freeing up the memory used to contain it, the interpreter creates the &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt; object at the same memory location as before, making good use of the available resources.

==Effects==
Garbage consumes heap memory, and thus one wishes to collect it (to minimize memory use, and allow faster memory allocation and prevent out-of-memory errors by reducing heap fragmentation and memory use).

However, collecting garbage takes time, and if done manually, requires coding overhead. Further, collecting garbage destroys objects and thus can cause calls to [[finalizer]]s, executing potentially arbitrary code at an arbitrary point in the program's execution. Incorrect garbage collection (deallocating memory that is not garbage), primarily due to errors in manual garbage collection (rather than errors in garbage collectors), results in [[memory safety]] violations (often security holes) due to use of [[dangling pointer]]s.

Syntactic garbage can be collected automatically, and garbage collectors have been extensively studied and developed. Semantic garbage cannot be automatically collected in general, and thus cause [[memory leak]]s even in garbage-collected languages. Detecting and eliminating semantic garbage is typically done using a specialized debugging tool called a [[heap profiler]], which allows one to see what objects are live and how they are reachable, enabling one to remove the unintended reference.

==Eliminating garbage==
The problem of managing the deallocation of garbage is a well-known one in computer science. Several approaches are taken:

* Many [[operating systems]] will reclaim the memory and resources used by a process or program when it terminates. Simple or short-lived programs which are designed to run in such environments can exit and allow the operating system to perform any necessary reclamation.
* In systems or [[programming language]]s with [[manual memory management]], the programmer must explicitly arrange for memory to be deallocated when it is no longer used. [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] are two well-known languages which support this model.
* [[Garbage collection (computer science)|Garbage collection]] uses various algorithms to automatically analyze the state of a program, identify garbage, and deallocate it without intervention by the programmer. Many modern programming languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] provide automated garbage collection. However, it is not a recent development, as it has also been used in older languages such as [[LISP]].
* There is ongoing research to [[type theory|type theoretic]] approaches (such as [[region inference]]) to identification and removal of garbage from a program. Note that no general type-theoretic solution to the problem has been developed.

During her pre-flight interview, she described her philosophy about human exploration of space:

{{quote|To me exploring space is just a natural progression of, where humans are going. As we become more advanced and we have more technology to go farther. Thousands of years ago people would just go beyond the next hill, go over the mountain, go across the river. Then it led to going across the oceans. And, then it was "OK, let's go into the skies." We now have airplanes. We can fly. We have submarines and submersibles; we can go into the waters. So looking into the skies and looking at the stars and at the planets and thinking, what's out there... We're curious. We, as humans always want to know what's out there. To me it, it just seems natural that we've looked around here and we're just going to go look out farther. We're still developing the means to go out there farther. But that's just where we're going to go next. To me, exploration makes sense because we're always looking at what's the next thing out there -- what else can we learn, and how can we go there. Maybe we can learn something that we can bring back here and help solve some of the problems we have on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts115/interview_piper.html Preflight Interview: Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper], NASA, July 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Lost tool bag during spacewalk====
[[File:STS-126 EVA2 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Stefanyshyn-Piper (left) and Shane Kimbrough, STS-126 mission specialists, in the mission's second scheduled session of EVA on the International Space Station]]
During the first [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] of STS-126 on November 18, 2008, as Stefanyshyn-Piper was preparing to begin work on the [[Solar Alpha Rotary Joint]], she noticed a significant amount of grease in her tool bag. "I think we had a grease gun explode in the large bag, because there's grease in the bag," Stefanyshyn-Piper reported to Kimbrough, who was working inside the shuttle to help coordinate the EVA.&lt;ref name="rsseva1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toolbag"/&gt; Mission Control managers instructed Stefanyshyn-Piper to clean up the grease using a dry wipe, and while she was doing the cleanup, she accidentally pushed aside the bag. "I guess one of my crew lock bags was not transferred and it's loose," Stefanyshyn-Piper told Kimbrough.&lt;ref name="toolbag"/&gt; The bag floated aft and starboard of the station, and did not pose a risk to the station or orbiter. The bag and its contents entered [[Low Earth Orbit]] as [[space debris]], where it eventually burned-up as it entered the Earth's atmosphere west of [[Mexico]] on August 3, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Malik, Managing Editor, Space.com "Tool Bag Lost In Space Meets Fiery End" August 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/news/090803-space-tool-bag-burns-up.html|title=Tool Bag Lost In Space Meets Fiery End|website=space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When in orbit, it was visible from the ground using a telescope.&lt;ref name="vid"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.p2pnet.net/story/17699|title=Kevin Fetter videos astronaut's lost tool bag|accessdate=December 17, 2008|publisher=People to People|year=2008|author=p2pnet news|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130222064832/http://www.p2pnet.net/story/17699|archivedate=February 22, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking an inventory of the items inside the lost bag, managers on the ground determined that Bowen had all those items in his bag, and the two could share equipment.&lt;ref name="toolbag"/&gt; While it extended the EVA duration slightly, the major objectives were not changed.&lt;ref name="rsseva1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toolbag"/&gt; The estimated value of the equipment lost is US$100,000.&lt;ref name="loss_value"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7741582.stm|title=Nothing lost in space - this time|accessdate=November 21, 2008 |publisher=bbc.co.uk|author=bbc.co.uk | date=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Mission Status Briefing, lead [[International Space Station]] Flight Director [[Ginger Kerrick]] said that there was no way to know what caused the bag to come loose.&lt;ref name="kerrick"/&gt; "We don't know that this incident occurred because they forgot to tether something. We don't know if perhaps the hook just came loose inside the bag," Kerrick said. "You've got to remember, we are working with humans here and we are prone to human error. We do the best we can, and we learn from our mistakes."&lt;ref name="kerrick"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/18018286/detail.html?rss=orlc&amp;psp=news|title=Astronaut Who Lost Tool Bag Admits Mistake|accessdate=November 20, 2008|publisher=WFTV|year=2008|agency=Associated Press|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118084042/http://www.wftv.com/news/18018286/detail.html?rss=orlc&amp;psp=news|archivedate=January 18, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Said Stefanyshyn-Piper of the incident, "that definitely was not the high point of the EVA. It was very disheartening to watch it float away."

==Retirement from NASA==
In July 2009, Stefanyshyn-Piper retired from NASA's [[NASA Astronaut Corps|Astronaut Corps]] to return to her Navy duties.&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt;

Fellow astronaut [[Steven Lindsey]], [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]] at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, stated on her retirement: "Heide has been an outstanding astronaut, contributing significantly to the Space Shuttle and Space Station programs. In particular, her superb leadership as lead spacewalker during the STS-126 mission resulted in restoring full power generation capability to the International Space Station. We wish her the best of luck back in the Navy – she will be missed."&lt;ref name="upi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2009/09/09/Astronaut-leaves-NASA-returns-to-the-Navy/UPI-69231252525393/|title=Astronaut leaves NASA, returns to the Navy|last=UPI|publisher=UPI|accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She was awarded two [[NASA Space Flight Medal]]s, and the [[NASA Exceptional Service Medal]].

In August 2009, Stefanyshyn-Piper reported to the [[Naval Sea Systems Command]] as the [[Chief Technology Officer]].

==Further Navy career==
On May 20, 2011 Captain Stefanyshyn-Piper became commander of the [[Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center]] in [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSWCCD Division Commander Press Release|url=http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/carderock/pub/who/leadership/div_cmdr.aspx|publisher=U.S. Navy|accessdate=15 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808114251/http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/carderock/pub/who/leadership/div_cmdr.aspx|archivedate=8 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, Captain Stefanyshyn-Piper assumed command of Southwest Regional Maintenance Center in [[San Diego]], [[California]], responsible for all non-[[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear]] ship maintenance in the San Diego area.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} She retired from the U.S. Navy after 30 years of active duty service on July 1, 2015.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

'''Cycling''' quickly became an activity after [[bicycles]] were introduced in the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;[[Bicycle]]&lt;/ref&gt; and remains popular with more than a billion people worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldometers.info/bicycles/ |title=Bicycles produced in the world&amp;nbsp;— Worldometers |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for recreation, transportation and sport.

==Racing==
[[File:BikeRacer.jpg|thumb|Bicycle Racer posed at [[Salt Palace]] wood track, [[Salt Lake City]], 1911]]

The first documented [[cycling race]] was a 1,200 metre race held on May 31, 1868 at the Park of [[Saint-Cloud]], [[Paris]].  It was won by expatriate Englishman [[James Moore (cyclist)|James Moore]] who rode a bicycle with solid rubber [[tire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Maso, B. (tr. Horn, M.) (2005), ''The Sweat of the Gods'', Mousehold Press, pp. 1-2, {{ISBN|1-874739-37-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[road bicycle racing|cycle race]] covering a distance between two cities was [[Paris–Rouen (cycle race)|Paris–Rouen]], also won by James Moore, who rode the 123 kilometres dividing both cities in 10 hours and 40 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/dossiers/dos_paris_rouen.php |title=memoire-du-cyclisme.net |work=memoire-du-cyclisme.net |accessdate=23 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304212639/http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/dossiers/dos_paris_rouen.php |archivedate=4 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest established bicycle racing club in the United States is the St. Louis Cycling Club.  Operating continuously since 1887, the club has sponsored races and timed distance events since its inception. Its members have included numerous national champions and Olympic team members.

==Recreation==
Cycling as recreation became organized shortly after racing did. In its early days, cycling brought the sexes together in an unchaperoned way, particularly after the 1880s when cycling became more accessible owing to the invention of the Rover Safety bicycle. Public cries of alarm at the prospect of moral chaos arose from this and from the evolution of women’s cycling attire, which grew progressively less enveloping and restrictive.&lt;ref name="Cycling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/147973/cycling/1670/Competition#toc214782%7ctitle=Cycling%7cpublisher=Britannica%7caccessdate=2015-06-03|title=cycling - sport|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 March 1915 the society for the construction of cycle paths in the Gooi and Eemland region in the [[Netherlands]] was founded. It is the last private “Cycle Path Society” that still exists today. Some people thought the increasing amount of motor traffic in the early 20th century was so dangerous for people cycling, especially those who rode as a leisure activity, that they wanted separate cycling infrastructure to be built. The routes would also not be connected to a route for motor traffic and mainly for recreation - so not the shortest routes, but the nicest routes.&lt;ref name="100 Years of cycle path building"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2014/03/13/100-years-of-cycle-path-building/|title=100 Years of cycle path building|publisher=Bicycle Dutch|accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today we see a resurgence of recreational cycling. We can see this with many companies&lt;ref name="Lekker bikes | Retro Bikes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lekkerbikes.com.au|title=Lekker bikes|accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Papillionaire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papillionaire.com.au|title=Papillionaire|accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; meeting the demand for this trend and specialising in retro/vintage style bikes that originated in the Netherlands.

==Commuting==
People have been riding bicycles to work since the initial bicycle heyday of the 1890s. According to the website Bike to Work, this practice continued in the United States until the 1920s, when biking experienced a sharp drop, in part due to the growth of [[suburbs]] and the popularity of the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biketoworkinfo.org/resources/rsc_history.cfm|title=Bike to Work :: About|work=biketoworkinfo.org|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, cycling to work continued to be common until the end of the 1950s.

Today many people ride bikes to work for a variety of reasons including fitness, [[Environmental policy|environmental]] concerns, convenience, [[frugality]], and enjoyment. According to the US Census Bureau’s 2008 [[American Community Survey|American Community Survey(ACS)]], on September 22, 2009, 0.55 percent of Americans use a bicycle as the primary means of getting to work.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.bikeleague.org/blog/2009/10/bicycle-commuting-trends-2000-to-2008/&lt;/ref&gt; Some places of employment offer amenities to bike commuters, such as showers, changing rooms, indoor bike racks and other secure bike parking.

==Touring==
Many cyclists wanted to use their machines to travel; some of them went around the world. [[Annie Londonderry]] did so in the 1880s, taking 15 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zheutlin|first1=Peter|title=Around the world on two wheels : Annie Londonderry's extraordinary ride|date=2007|publisher=Citadel|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8065-2851-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six Indian men cycled 71000&amp;nbsp;km around the world in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=With Cyclists Around the World|author =  Adi B Hakim|publisher = Roli Books|orig-year=First published 1928|date=2008|isbn13=978-8174366184|quotation=Travelling 44,000 miles, at times in 140'F heat - for days without food, at times without water, at times in pirate-infested territories, at times in swamp-lands - they cycled through dense jungles and notched up many 'firsts' while pedalling round the globe. They were the first to cycle the world - six young boys from Bombay Weightlifting Club, who started this journey of adventure on 15 October 1923. Crossing the deserts of Persia, Mesopotamia, Syria and Sinai, they became the first globetrotters to cover the most arduous journey of their lives in four years and five months.

== The cycling craze ==
With four key aspects (steering, safety, comfort and speed) improved over the [[penny-farthing]], bicycles became very popular among elites and the middle classes in Europe and North America in the middle and late 1890s.  It was the first bicycle that was suitable for women, and as such became the "freedom machine" (as American feminist [[Susan B. Anthony]] called it),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nshss.org/media/1455/postolowski.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; giving women "a feeling of freedom and self-reliance".&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=Women's work |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/womens-work|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Svea_Velocipede.jpg|thumb|150px|The [Svea Velocipede]] by [[Fredrik Ljungström]] and [[Birger Ljungström]], exhibitioned at the [[Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology]].]]
The [[Svea Velocipede]] with vertical pedal arrangement and [[locking hubs]] was introduced in 1892 by the Swedish engineers [[Fredrik Ljungström]] and [[Birger Ljungström]]. It attracted attention at the [[World Fair]] and was produced in a few thousand units.

Bicycle historians often call this period the "golden age" or "[[bicycle craze]]." By the start of the 20th century, cycling had become an important means of transportation, and in the United States an increasingly popular form of recreation.  Bicycling clubs for men and women spread across the U.S. and across European countries. [[Chicago]] immigrant [[Adolph Schoeninger]] with his [[Western Wheel Works]] became the "Ford of the Bicycle" (ten years before [[Henry Ford]]) by copying Pope's mass production methods and by introducing [[metal stamping|stamping]] to the production process in place of machining, significantly reducing production costs, and thus prices.&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, Glen. ''The Ride to Modernity: The Bicycle in Canada, 1869-1900'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001), p.107.&lt;/ref&gt; His "Crescent" bicycles thus became affordable for working people, and massive exports from the United States lowered prices in Europe. The [[Panic of 1893]] wiped out many American manufacturers who had not followed the lead of Pope and Schoeninger, in the same way as the [[Great Depression]] would ruin car makers who did not follow [[History of Ford Motor Company#Early developments|Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ellimans-Universal-Embrocation-Slough-1897-Ad.png|thumb|upright|left|1897 ad, showing unskirted garment for women's bicycle riding]]
[[File:Bicycle suit punch 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|Bicycle suit vs conventional clothing]]

The impact of the bicycle on female emancipation should not be underestimated. The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to their larger participation in the lives of Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom they embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolise the [[New Woman]] of the late nineteenth century, especially in Britain and the United States.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; [[Feminist]]s and [[suffragist]]s recognised its transformative power. [[Susan B. Anthony]] said, "Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel...the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood." In 1895 [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]], the tightly laced president of the [[Women’s Christian Temperance Union]], wrote a book called ''How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle'' (described in ''Bicycling'' magazine as "the greatest book ever written on learning to ride"&lt;ref&gt;''Bicycling'',  November 2006, p.78. &lt;!--And ''that'' is how citation is done. Except you've left off the author &amp; title of the article...--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;), in which she praised the bicycle she learned to ride late in life, and which she named "Gladys", for its "gladdening effect" on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action, proclaiming, "I would not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum."&lt;ref&gt;Willard, Frances. ''Glimpses of fifty years: the autobiography of an American woman''. (Woman's Temperance Publication Association, 1889 &lt;!--city?--&gt;p.231.&lt;!--Where did you learn how to do citations?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Robins Pennell]] started cycling in the 1870s in Philadelphia,&lt;ref&gt;Pennell, Elizabeth. ''Over the Alps on  Bicycle'' (1898&lt;!--Publisher &amp; city?--&gt;)., p. 16.&lt;!--Where did you learn to do citations?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and from the 1880s onwards brought out a series of travelogues about her cycling journeys around Europe, from ''A Canterbury Pilgrimage'' to ''Over the Alps on a Bicycle''. In 1895 [[Annie Londonderry]] became the first woman to bicycle around the world.

The backlash against the New (bicycling) Woman was demonstrated when the male undergraduates of [[Cambridge University]] chose to show their opposition to the admission of women as full members of the university by hanging a woman in [[effigy]] in the main town square—tellingly, a woman on a bicycle—as late as 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080513233524/http://www.newn.cam.ac.uk/about/about_history2.shtml Newnham College Cambridge: The History of the College&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since women could not cycle in the then-current fashions for voluminous and restrictive dress, the [[bicycle craze]] fed into a movement for so-called [[rational dress]], which helped liberate women from corsets and ankle-length skirts and other encumbering garments, substituting the then-shocking [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]].

'''Information systems''' ('''IS''') are formal, sociotechnical, organizational systems designed to collect, process, store, and distribute [[information]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Piccoli |first1=Gabriele |last2=Pigni |first2=Federico |title=Information systems for managers : with cases |publisher=Prospect Press |isbn=978-1-943153-50-3 |pages=28 |edition=Edition 4.0 |url=https://prospectpressvt.com/titles/piccoli-information-systems-for-managers/ |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
In a [[sociotechnical]] perspective Information Systems are composed by four components: technology, process, people and organizational structure&lt;ref name="Ohara et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O’Hara |first1=Margaret |last2=Watson |first2=Richard |last3=Cavan |first3=Bruce |title=Managing the three levels of change |journal=Information Systems Management |date=1999 |page=64 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Watson5/publication/220630523_Managing_the_three_Levels_of_Change/links/55ae362f08ae98e661a59b93/Managing-the-three-Levels-of-Change.pdf |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A computer information system is a system that a branch of Science composed of people and computers that processes or interprets information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/information-system.html| title=information system| work=BusinessDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Information Systems| work=Principia Cybernetica Web| url= http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/INFORM_SYSTE.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/287895/information-system |title=Information system| work=Britannica.com| author= Vladimir Zwass |date=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D’Atri A., De Marco M., Casalino N.

The term is also sometimes used in more restricted senses to refer to only the software used to run a computerized database or to refer to only a computer system.

'''Information Systems''' is an academic study of systems with a specific reference to information and the complementary networks of hardware and software that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and also distribute [[data (computing)|data]]. An emphasis is placed on an information system having a definitive boundary, users, processors, storage, inputs, outputs and the aforementioned communication networks.&lt;ref&gt;Jessup, Leonard M.; Joseph S. Valacich (2008). ''Information Systems Today'' (3rd ed.). Pearson Publishing. Pages ??? &amp; Glossary p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

Any specific information system aims to support operations, management and [[decision-making]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2013|year=|title=The first phase of creating a standardised international  technological implementation framework/software application|url=http://www.inderscience.com/info/inarticle.php?artid=55312|journal=Int.

(2008). Experiencing MIS. Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors make a clear distinction between information systems, [[computer system]]s, and [[business process]]es. Information systems typically include an ICT component but are not purely concerned with ICT, focusing instead on the end use of information technology. Information systems are also different from business processes. Information systems help to control the performance of business processes.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J A. (2003). Introduction to information systems: essentials for the e-business enterprise. McGraw-Hill, Boston, MA&lt;/ref&gt;

Alter&lt;ref&gt;Alter, S. (2003) "18 Reasons Why IT-Reliant Work Systems Should Replace 'The IT Artifact' as the Core Subject Matter of the IS Field," ''Communications of the Association for Information Systems'', 12(23), Oct., pp. 365–394, http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol12/iss1/23/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alter | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = Work System Theory: Overview of Core Concepts, Extensions, and Challenges for the Future | url = | journal = Journal of the Association for Information Systems | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 72–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues for advantages of viewing an information system as a special type of [[work system]]. A work system is a system in which humans or machines perform processes and activities using resources to produce specific products or services for customers. An information system is a work system whose activities are devoted to capturing, transmitting, storing, retrieving, manipulating and displaying information.&lt;ref&gt;Alter, S. (2006) The Work System Method: Connecting People, Processes, and IT for Business Results. Works System Press, CA&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, information systems inter-relate with [[data systems]] on the one hand and activity systems on the other. An information system is a form of [[communication]] system in which data represent and are processed as a form of social memory. An information system can also be considered a semi-[[formal language]] which supports human decision making and action.

Information systems are the primary focus of study for [[organizational informatics]].&lt;ref&gt;Beynon-Davies P. (2009). Business Information Systems. Palgrave, Basingstoke&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Silver et al. (1995) provided two views on IS that includes software, hardware, data, people, and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Marc S. Silver, M. Lynne Markus, [[Cynthia Mathis Beath]]|title=The Information Technology Interactive Model: A Foundation for the MBA Core Course|journal=MIS Quarterly|date=Sep 1995|pages=361–390|url=http://misq.org/the-information-technology-interaction-model-a-foundation-for-the-mba-core-course.html?SID=k2fh85s9nd5a2ne85qh5a3art7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zheng provided another [http://www.slideshare.net/jgzheng/information-system-a-system-view system view of information system] which also adds processes and essential [[system]] elements like environment, boundary, purpose, and interactions.
The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] defines "Information systems specialists [as] focus[ing] on integrating information technology solutions and business processes to meet the information needs of businesses and other enterprises."&lt;ref name="curricula"&gt;The Joint Task Force for Computing Curricula 2005. [http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021153204/http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf |date=2014-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various types of information systems, for example: [[transaction processing system]]s, [[decision support system]]s, [[knowledge management system]]s, [[learning management system]]s, [[database management system]]s, and office information systems. Critical to most information systems are information technologies, which are typically designed to enable humans to perform tasks for which the human brain is not well suited, such as: handling large amounts of information, performing complex calculations, and controlling many simultaneous processes.

Information technologies are a very important and malleable resource available to executives.&lt;ref&gt;Rockart et al. (1996) Eight imperatives for the new IT organization Sloan Management review.&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies have created a position of [[chief information officer]] (CIO) that sits on the executive board with the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO), [[chief financial officer]] (CFO), [[chief operating officer]] (COO), and [[chief technical officer]] (CTO). The CTO may also serve as CIO, and vice versa. The [[chief information security officer]] (CISO) focuses on information security management.

The six components that must come together in order to produce an information system are: (Information systems are organizational procedures and do not need a computer or software, this data is erroneous) (IE, an accounting system in the 1400s using ledger and ink utilizes an information system)
# Hardware: The term hardware refers to machinery. This category includes the computer itself, which is often referred to as the central processing unit (CPU), and all of its support equipment. Among the support, equipment are input and output devices, storage devices and communications devices.
# Software: The term software refers to computer programs and the manuals (if any) that support them. Computer programs are machine-readable instructions that direct the circuitry within the hardware parts of the system to function in ways that produce useful information from data. Programs are generally stored on some input/output medium, often a disk or tape.
# Data: Data are facts that are used by programs to produce useful information. Like programs, data are generally stored in machine-readable form on disk or tape until the computer needs them.
# Procedures: Procedures are the policies that govern the operation of a computer system. "Procedures are to people what software is to hardware" is a common analogy that is used to illustrate the role of procedures in a system.
# People: Every system needs people if it is to be useful. Often the most overlooked element of the system are the people, probably the component that most influence the success or failure of information systems. This includes "not only the users, but those who operate and service the computers, those who maintain the data, and those who support the network of computers." &lt;Kroenke, D. M. (2015). MIS Essentials. Pearson Education&gt;';
#Feedback: it is another component of the IS, that defines that an IS may be provided with a feedback (Although this component isn't necessary to function).

Data is the bridge between hardware and people. This means that the data we collect is only data until we involve people. At that point, data is now information.

==Types of information system==
[[File:Four-Level-Pyramid-model.png|thumb|A four level hierarchy |250px]]

The "classic" view of Information systems found in the textbooks&lt;ref&gt;Laudon, K.C. and Laudon, J.P. Management Information Systems, (2nd edition), Macmillan, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1980s was a pyramid of systems that reflected the hierarchy of the organization, usually [[transaction processing systems]] at the bottom of the pyramid, followed by [[management information systems]], [[decision support systems]], and ending with [[executive information systems]] at the top. Although the pyramid model remains useful since it was first formulated, a number of new technologies have been developed and new categories of information systems have emerged, some of which no longer fit easily into the original pyramid model.

Some examples of such systems are:
* [[data warehouses]]
* [[enterprise resource planning]]
* [[enterprise systems]]
* [[expert systems]]
* [[search engines]]
* [[geographic information system]]
* [[global information system]]
* [[office automation]].

A '''computer(-based) information system''' is essentially an IS using computer technology to carry out some or all of its planned tasks. The basic components of computer-based information systems are:
* ''Hardware''- these are the devices like the monitor, processor, printer and keyboard, all of which work together to accept, process, show data and information.
* ''Software''- are the programs that allow the hardware to process the data.
* ''Databases''- are the gathering of associated files or tables containing related data.
* ''Networks''- are a connecting system that allows diverse computers to distribute resources.
* ''Procedures''- are the commands for combining the components above to process information and produce the preferred output.

The first four components (hardware, software, database, and network) make up what is known as the information technology platform.
Information technology workers could then use these components to create information systems that watch over safety measures, risk and the management of data. These actions are known as information technology services.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer, R. Kelly Jr and Casey G. Cegielski. Introduction to Information System: Support and Transforming Business Fourth Edition. New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain information systems support parts of organizations, others support entire organizations, and still others, support groups of organizations. Recall that each department or functional area within an organization has its own collection of application programs or information systems. These functional area information systems (FAIS) are supporting pillars for more general IS namely, [[business intelligence]] systems and [[dashboard]]s {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. As the name suggest, each FAIS support a particular function within the organization, e.g.: accounting IS, finance IS, production-operation management (POM) IS, marketing IS, and human resources IS. In finance and accounting, managers use IT systems to forecast revenues and business activity, to determine the best sources and uses of funds, and to perform audits to ensure that the organization is fundamentally sound and that all financial reports and documents are accurate. Other types of organizational information systems are FAIS, [[Transaction processing system]]s, [[enterprise resource planning]], [[office automation]] system, [[management information system]], [[decision support system]], [[expert system]], executive dashboard, [[supply chain management system]], and [[electronic commerce]] system. Dashboards are a special form of IS that support all managers of the organization. They provide rapid access to timely information and direct access to structured information in the form of reports. Expert systems attempt to duplicate the work of human experts by applying reasoning capabilities, knowledge, and expertise within a specific domain.

==Information system development==
Information technology departments in larger organizations tend to strongly influence the development, use, and application of information technology in the organizations.
A series of methodologies and processes can be used to develop and use an information system. Many developers use a systems engineering approach such as the [[system development life cycle]] (SDLC), to systematically develop an information system in stages.  The stages of the system development lifecycle are planning, system analysis and requirements, system design, development, integration and testing, implementation and operations and maintenance. 
Recent research aims at enabling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neumann|first1=Gustaf|last2=Sobernig|first2=Stefan|last3=Aram|first3=Michael|title=Evolutionary Business Information Systems|journal=Business and Information Systems Engineering|date=February 2014|volume=6|issue=1|pages=33–36|doi=10.1007/s12599-013-0305-1|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12599-013-0305-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and measuring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aram|first1=Michael|last2=Neumann|first2=Gustaf|title=Multilayered analysis of co-development of business information systems|journal=Journal of Internet Services and Applications|date=2015-07-01|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s13174-015-0030-8|url=http://www.jisajournal.com/content/pdf/s13174-015-0030-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ongoing, collective development of such systems within an organization by the entirety of human actors themselves.
An information system can be developed in house (within the organization) or outsourced. This can be accomplished by outsourcing certain components or the entire system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Using MIS|year=2009|publisher=Kroenke|isbn=0-13-713029-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific case is the geographical distribution of the development team ([[offshoring]], [[global information system]]).

A computer-based information system, following a definition of [[Börje Langefors|Langefors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= [[Börje Langefors]]|first=|title=Theoretical Analysis of Information Systems|year=1973|publisher=Auerbach|isbn=0-87769-151-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a technologically implemented medium for:
* recording, storing, and disseminating linguistic expressions,
* as well as for drawing conclusions from such expressions.
&lt;!-- hiding this incomprehensible 5-part compound noun: This can be formulated as a generalized information systems design mathematical program. --&gt;

[[Geographic information systems in geospatial intelligence|Geographic information systems]], land information systems, and disaster information systems are examples of emerging information systems, but they can be broadly considered as spatial information systems.
System development is done in stages which include:
* Problem recognition and specification
* Information gathering
* Requirements specification for the new system
* System design
* System construction
* System implementation

==As an academic discipline==
{{see also|Information science|Information technology|Information management}}

The field of study called ''information systems'' encompasses a variety of topics including systems analysis and design, computer networking, information security, database management and decision support systems. ''[[Information management]]'' deals with the practical and theoretical problems of collecting and analyzing information in a business function area including business productivity tools, applications programming and implementation, electronic commerce, digital media production, data mining, and decision support. ''Communications and networking'' deals with the telecommunication technologies.
Information systems bridges [[business]] and [[computer science]] using the theoretical foundations of [[information]] and [[computation]] to study various business models and related [[algorithm]]ic processes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/courses/units/Computer-and-Logic-Essentials-COS10003/local|title=Computer and Logic Essentials - Units of study - Swinburne University of Technology - Melbourne, Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on building the IT systems &lt;ref&gt;http://www1.rmit.edu.au/courses/049802&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/courses/units/Systems-Development-INF60003/local|title=Systems Development - Units of study - Swinburne University of Technology - Melbourne, Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; within a computer science discipline.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1999 1–27"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Sue |last2=Gibson |first2=Nicola |last3=Holland |first3=Christopher |last4=Light |first4=Ben |date=July 1999 |title=Focus Issue on Legacy Information Systems and Business Process Engineering: a Business Perspective of Legacy Information Systems |journal=Communications of the AIS |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archibald1975"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Archibald |first=J.A. |date=May 1975 |title=Computer Science education for majors of other disciplines |journal=AFIPS Joint Computer Conferences |pages=903–906 |quote=Computer science spreads out over several related disciplines, and shares with these disciplines certain sub-disciplines that traditionally have been located exclusively in the more conventional disciplines}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denning1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Denning |first=Peter |date=July 1999 |title=COMPUTER SCIENCE: THE DISCIPLINE |journal=Encyclopaedia of Computer Science (2000 Edition) |quote=The Domain of Computer Science: Even though computer science addresses both human-made and natural information processes, the main effort in the discipline has been directed toward human-made processes, especially information processing systems and machines}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coy 2004 7–10"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coy |first=Wolfgang |date=June 2004 |title=Between the disciplines |journal=ACM SIGCSE Bulletin |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=7–10 |issn= 0097-8418 |quote=Computer science may be in the core of these processes.

Several IS scholars have debated the nature and foundations of Information Systems which have its roots in other reference disciplines such as [[Computer Science]], [[Engineering]], [[Mathematics]], [[Management Science]], [[Cybernetics]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Culnan, M. J. Mapping the Intellectual Structure of MIS, 1980-1985: A Co-Citation Analysis, ''MIS Quarterly'', 1987, pp. 341-353.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keen, P. G. W.

Information Systems: An Emerging Discipline?, McGraw- Hill, London, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Information systems also can be defined as a collection of hardware, software, data, people and procedures that work together to produce quality information.

===Differentiating IS from related disciplines===
[[File:IS-Relationships-Chart.jpg|thumb|Information Systems relationship to [[Information Technology]], [[Computer Science]], [[Information Science]], and [[Business]].]]

Similar to computer science, other disciplines can be seen as both related and foundation disciplines of IS. The domain of study of IS involves the study of theories and practices related to the social and technological phenomena, which determine the development, use, and effects of information systems in organization and society.&lt;ref&gt;John, W., and Joe, P. (2002) "Strategic Planning for Information System." 3rd Ed. West Sussex. John wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; But, while there may be considerable overlap of the disciplines at the boundaries, the disciplines are still differentiated by the focus, purpose, and orientation of their activities.&lt;ref name="dogpile.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booksbw.com/books/computers/leslie-j/2006/files/informationsystems2006.pdf#page=30|title=Scoping the Discipline of Information Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a broad scope, the term ''Information Systems'' is a scientific field of study that addresses the range of strategic, managerial, and operational activities involved in the gathering, processing, storing, distributing, and use of information and its associated technologies in society and organizations.&lt;ref name="dogpile.com"/&gt; The term information systems is also used to describe an organizational function that applies IS knowledge in industry, government agencies, and not-for-profit organizations.&lt;ref name="dogpile.com"/&gt; ''Information Systems'' often refers to the interaction between algorithmic processes and technology. This interaction can occur within or across organizational boundaries. An information system is the technology an organization uses and also the way in which the organizations interact with the technology and the way in which the technology works with the organization’s business processes. Information systems are distinct from [[information technology]] (IT) in that an information system has an information technology component that interacts with the processes' components.

One problem with that approach is that it prevents the IS field from being interested in non-organizational use of ICT, such as in social networking, computer gaming, mobile personal usage, etc. A different way of differentiating the IS field from its neighbours is to ask, "Which aspects of reality are most meaningful in the IS field and other fields?"&lt;ref name="ref-basden-2010"&gt;[http://aisel.aisnet.org/ukais2009/10 Basden, A. (2010)  On Using Spheres of Meaning to Define and Dignify the IS Discipline.  ''International Journal of Information Management'', 30, 13-20.]  It employs the philosophy of the late [[Herman Dooyeweerd]] to differentiate distinct aspects or 'spheres of meaning'. The paper suggests that while computer science finds the [http://www.dooy.info/formative.html formative] aspect, of shaping, structuring, processing, of central interest, and business and organizational fields find the [http://www.dooy.info//economic.html economic] and [http://www.dooy.info/social.html social] aspects of central interest, the Information Systems field can find the [http://www.dooy.info/lingual.html lingual aspect] of central interest, while making links with the aspects of the neighbouring disciplines.&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach, based on philosophy, helps to define not just the focus, purpose and orientation, but also the dignity, destiny and, responsibility of the field among other fields.

==Career pathways==

Information Systems workers enter a number of different careers:
* [[Information System Strategy]]
* [[Management Information System]]s
* [[Project Management]]
* [[Enterprise Architecture]]
* [[Software development|IS Development]]
* IS Organization
* [[Information technology consulting|IS Consulting]] 
* IS Security
* IS Auditor

There is a wide variety of career paths in the information systems discipline. "Workers with specialized technical knowledge and strong communications skills will have the best prospects. Workers with management skills and an understanding of business practices and principles will have excellent opportunities, as companies are increasingly looking to technology to drive their revenue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Sloan Career Cornerstone Center; Alfred P. Sloan Foundation|year=2008|url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/infosys/infosys.htm|title=Information Systems|accessdate=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information technology is important to the operation of contemporary businesses, it offers many employment opportunities. The information systems field includes the people in organizations who design and build information systems, the people who use those systems, and the people responsible for managing those systems.
The demand for traditional IT staff such as programmers, business analysts, systems analysts, and designer is significant. Many well-paid jobs exist in areas of Information technology. At the top of the list is the chief information officer (CIO).

The CIO is the executive who is in charge of the IS function. In most organizations, the CIO works with the chief executive officer (CEO), the chief financial officer (CFO), and other senior executives. Therefore, he or she actively participates in the organization's strategic planning process.

==Research==
Information systems research is generally interdisciplinary concerned with the study of the effects of information systems on the behaviour of individuals, groups, and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Galliers, R.D., [[M. Lynne Markus|Markus, M.L.]], &amp; Newell, S. (Eds) (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=brOkAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Exploring+information+systems+research+approaches:+readings+and+reflections ''Exploring Information Systems Research Approaches.''] New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudio Ciborra|Ciborra, C.]] (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=jb-vrAHmG0wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Labyrinths+of+Information ''The Labyrinths of Information: Challenging the Wisdom of Systems.''] Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Hevner et al. (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hevner | first1 =  | last2 = March | first2 =  | last3 = Park | first3 =  | last4 = Ram | first4 =  | year = 2004 | title = Design Science in Information Systems Research | url = | journal = MIS Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 75–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; categorized research in IS into two scientific paradigms including ''behavioural science'' which is to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior and'' design science'' which extends the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts.

Salvatore March and Gerald Smith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = March | first1 = S. | last2 = Smith | first2 = G. | year = 1995 | title = Design and natural science in [[Information Technology]] (IT) | url = | journal = Decision Support Systems | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 251–266 | doi=10.1016/0167-9236(94)00041-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework for researching different aspects of Information Technology including outputs of the research (research outputs) and activities to carry out this research (research activities). They identified research outputs as follows:

# ''Constructs'' which are concepts that form the vocabulary of a domain. They constitute a conceptualization used to describe problems within the domain and to specify their solutions.
# A ''model'' which is a set of propositions or statements expressing relationships among constructs.
# A ''method'' which is a set of steps (an algorithm or guideline) used to perform a task. Methods are based on a set of underlying constructs and a representation (model) of the solution space.
# An ''instantiation'' is the realization of an artifact in its environment.

Also research activities including:
# ''Build'' an artifact to perform a specific task.
# ''Evaluate'' the artifact to determine if any progress has been achieved.
# Given an artifact whose performance has been evaluated, it is important to determine why and how the artifact worked or did not work within its environment. Therefore, ''theorize'' and ''justify'' theories about IT artifacts.

Although Information Systems as a discipline has been evolving for over 30 years now,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Avgerou | first1 = C | year = 2000 | title = Information systems: what sort of science is it? | url = | journal = Omega | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 567–579 | doi=10.1016/s0305-0483(99)00072-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the core focus or identity of IS research is still subject to debate among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benbasat | first1 = I. | last2 = Zmud | first2 = R. | year = 2003 | title = The identity crisis within the IS discipline: defining and communicating the discipline's core properties | url = | journal = MIS Quarterly | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 183–194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Agarwal | first1 = R. | last2 = Lucas | first2 = H. | year = 2005 | title = The information systems identity crisis: focusing on high- visibility and high-impact research | url = | journal = MIS Quarterly | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 381–398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = El Sawy | first1 = O | year = 2003 | title = The IS core –IX: The 3 faces of IS identity: connection, immersion, and fusion | url = | journal = Communications of the AIS | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 588–598 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main views around this debate: a narrow view focusing on the IT artifact as the core subject matter of IS research, and a broad view that focuses on the interplay between social and technical aspects of IT that is embedded into a dynamic evolving context.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour, O., Ghazawneh, A. (2009) Research in Information Systems: Implications of the constant changing nature of IT capabilities in the social computing era, in Molka-Danielsen, J. (Ed.):'' Proceedings of the 32nd Information Systems Research Seminar in Scandinavia'', IRIS 32, Inclusive Design, Molde University College, Molde, Norway, August 9–12, 2009. {{ISBN|978-82-7962-120-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A third view&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orlikowski | first1 = W. | last2 = Iacono | first2 = C. | year = 2001 | title = Research commentary: desperately seeking the "IT" in IT research—a call to theorizing about the IT artifact | url = | journal = Information Systems Research | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 121–134 | doi=10.1287/isre.12.2.121.9700}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls on IS scholars to pay balanced attention to both the IT artifact and its context.

Since the study of information systems is an applied field, industry practitioners expect information systems research to generate findings that are immediately applicable in practice. This is not always the case however, as information systems researchers often explore behavioral issues in much more depth than practitioners would expect them to do. This may render information systems research results difficult to understand, and has led to criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kock | first1 = N. | authorlink = Ned Kock | authorlink4 = Heinz Klein | last2 = Gray | first2 = P. | last3 = Hoving | first3 = R. | last4 = Klein | first4 = H. | last5 = Myers | first5 = M. | last6 = Rockart | first6 = J. | year = 2002 | title = Information Systems Research Relevance Revisited: Subtle Accomplishment, Unfulfilled Promise, or Serial Hypocrisy? | url = http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol8/iss1/23/ | journal = Communications of the Association for Information Systems | volume = 8 | issue = 23| pages = 330–346 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last ten years, the business trend is represented by the considerable increasing of Information Systems Function (ISF) role, especially with regard the enterprise strategies and operations supporting. It became a key-factor to increase productivity and to support new value creation.&lt;ref&gt;Casalino, N., Mazzone, G. (2008): Externalization of a banking information systems function. Features, regulatory and critical aspects, ''in Interdisciplinary Aspects of Information Systems Studies'', D’Atri A., De Marco M., Casalino N. (Eds.), Physica-Verlag, Springer, Heidelberg, Germany, pp. 89-96, {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2009-6}}, {{doi|10.1007/978-3-7908-2010-2_12}}&lt;/ref&gt; To study an information system itself, rather than its effects, information systems models are used, such as [[EATPUT]].

The international body of Information Systems researchers, the [[Association for Information Systems]] (AIS), and its Senior Scholars Forum Subcommittee on Journals (23 April 2007), proposed a 'basket' of journals that the AIS deems as 'excellent', and nominated: ''[[Management Information Systems Quarterly]]'' (MISQ), ''[[Information Systems Research]]'' (ISR), ''[[Journal of the Association for Information Systems]]'' (JAIS), ''[[Journal of Management Information Systems]]'' (JMIS), ''[[European Journal of Information Systems]]'' (EJIS), and ''[[Information Systems Journal]]'' (ISJ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Senior Scholars|year=2007|title=AIS Senior Scholars Forum Subcommittee on Journals: A basket of six (or eight) A* journals in Information Systems |url=http://home.aisnet.org/associations/7499/files/Senior%20Scholars%20Letter.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003184529/http://home.aisnet.org/associations/7499/files/Senior%20Scholars%20Letter.pdf|archivedate=October 3, 2007|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Interspiro DCSC''' is a semi-closed circuit nitrox [[rebreather]] manufactured by [[Interspiro]] of Sweden for military applications.
Interspiro was formerly a division of AGA and has been manufacturing self-contained breathing apparatus for diving, firefighting and rescue applications since the 1950s.

==History==
The first Interspiro rebreather was the ACSC - the alternating closed and semi-closed circuit rebreather which was developed and marketed in the 1980s. In the 1990s this design was developed further to become the DCSC, also intended for mine countermeasures.

==Construction==
Gas supply is carried in a 5l 200bar aluminium cylinder mounted horizontally at the bottom of the unit with the valve to the diver's left. The reserve valve and bypass valve are also on the left.

The fairing case holding the components is clipped to the tubular harness frame and can be released by pulling a knob on the lower right.

The scrubber is a radial flow cylindrical design, with inward flow. It carries a 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg charge of absorbent.

The counterlung is a wedge shaped bellows, hinged on the lower edge, and the angle between the top and bottom covers is proportional to the internal volume. The change in top plate angle, as the diver breathes, controls the gas addition mechanism.&lt;ref name="Larsson 2000" /&gt;

The top plate of the bellows is ballasted, so that the lifting force of the air inside is balanced by the weights: when the diver is trimmed horizontally, face down, the weights create a slight positive pressure relative to ambient. This compensates for the depth difference between the counterlung and the diver's lungs, reducing the effort required to breathe. When the diver is upright the effect of the weights is cancelled as the weight is carried by the hinge, and when the diver is horizontal, face up, the weight causes a slight negative pressure in the bellows, which compensates for the increased hydrostatic pressure on the counterlung compared with the lungs.

The dump valve for the loop and also functions as a drain for water. The counterlung is in the exhalation side of the loop. Water from condensate and leakage is trapped in the bellows before it can reach the scrubber, and can be discharged through the exhaust valve for the loop, which is mounted on the lower plate of the bellows.&lt;ref name="Larsson 2000" /&gt;

Volume of the bellows is about 4.5 litres, and total loop volume is about 7 litres.

Gas circulation: Exhalation hose to the right, inhalation from the left.

Approved operating depth range is from 0 to 57m. Nitrox 28% is used for depths below about 30m. and 46% for shallower depths.

;Dimensions:
:Mass approximately 33kg

==Operating principle==
The DCSC is an active addition semi-closed circuit rebreather, but has more in common with the passive addition systems, in that the amount of feed gas supplied is a function of the breathing rate of the diver. Unlike most passive addition rebreathers, the gas feed mass flow rate is independent of depth, and unlike most active addition systems, it is not constant mass flow.

===Demand controlled semi-closed circuit===
The Interspiro DCSC is the only rebreather using this gas mixture control principle that has been marketed. 
The principle of operation is to add a mass of oxygen that is proportional to the volume of each breath. This approach is based on the assumption that the volumetric breathing rate of a diver is directly proportional to metabolic oxygen consumption, which experimental evidence indicates is close enough to work.&lt;ref name="Larsson 2000" /&gt;
The fresh gas addition is made by controlling the pressure in a dosage chamber proportional to the counterlung bellows volume. The dosage chamber is filled with fresh gas to a pressure proportional to bellows volume, with the highest pressure when the bellows is in the empty position. When the bellows fills during exhalation, the gas is released from the dosage chamber into the breathing circuit, proportional to the volume in the bellows during exhalation, and is fully released when the bellows is full. Excess gas is dumped to the environment through the overpressure valve after the bellows is full.&lt;ref name="Larsson 2000" /&gt;

The result is the addition of a mass of gas proportional to ventilation volume.

The volume of the dosage chamber is matched to a specific supply gas mixture, and is changed when the gas is changed. The DCSC uses two standard mixtures of nitrox: 28% and 46%, and has two corresponding dosage chambers.&lt;ref name="Larsson 2000" /&gt;

The DCSC controls the feed gas pressure in the dosage chamber by changes of bellows angle, which is proportional to the change in volume in the loop. A mechanical linkage connects the bellows cover plate to an oscillating cam which controls loading of the diaphragm spring. The spring force controls a diaphragm in the dosage regulator which actuates the inlet and outlet valves.

Exhalation will increase of bellows angle and will increase loading on the control spring, pushing the dosage inlet valve open and allowing gas to flow into the dosage chamber until the increased pressure lifts the diaphragm and closes the valve again.

Inhalation will decrease the bellows angle, which reduces the spring loading, and the internal pressure in the dosage chamber will lift the diaphragm against the spring, opening the dosage outlet valve and allowing the gas to flow into the breathing circuit until the pressure in the dosage chamber is matched by the spring force, and the diaphragm is pushed back against the outlet valve to close it.

The feed gas is supplied by a depth compensated first stage regulator which takes gas from the cylinder and reduces the pressure to 3 bar above ambient pressure.
A linkage connected to the bellows rotates a cam against the control spring in the dosage regulator, to adjust the spring force on the dosage regulator diaphragm.

===Alarms and warnings===
If the gas supply to the dosage mechanism were to fail without warning, the gas addition would stop and the diver would use up the oxygen in the loop gas until it became hypoxic and the diver lost consciousness. To prevent this, there is a controllable flow restriction in the inhalation side of the loop, which is operated by pressure from the supply gas in the dosage mechanism. This is open when there is suitable operating pressure in the dosage mechanism, but if this falls, the flow warning system imposes a restriction to the inhalation gas flow, similar to the effect of a low supply pressure on an open circuit demand valve, which warns the diver that there is a feed gas supply failure. The diver can then activate the reserve mechanism on the cylinder valve, which allows the last 25 bar from the cylinder to be used, which will de-activate the warning restriction. If the gas supply remains inadequate, the diver must take other action, such as bailing out to an independent open circuit gas supply.

==Oxygen partial pressure in the breathing loop==
The gas calculation differs from other semi-closed circuit rebreathers.
A diver with a constant workload during aerobic working conditions will use an approximately constant amount of oxygen &lt;math&gt;V_{O_2}&lt;/math&gt; as a fraction of the respiratory minute volume &lt;math&gt;V_{RM}&lt;/math&gt;. This ratio of minute ventilation and oxygen uptake is the extraction ratio &lt;math&gt;K_E&lt;/math&gt;, and usually falls in the range of 17 to 25 with a normal value of about 20 for healthy humans. Values as low as 10 and as high as 30 have been measured.&lt;ref name="Morrison" /&gt; Variations may be caused by the diet of the diver and the dead space of the diver and equipment, raised levels of carbon dioxide, or raised work of breathing and tolerance to carbon dioxide.
  
:&lt;math&gt;K_E=\frac{V_{RM}}{V_{O_2}}&lt;/math&gt; (approximately 20)

Therefore, the respiratory minute volume may be expressed as a function of the extraction ratio and oxygen uptake:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{RM}=K_E*V_{O_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The volume of gas in the breathing circuit can be described as approximately constant, and the fresh gas addition must balance the sum of the dumped volume, the metabolically removed oxygen, and the volume change due to depth change. (metabolic carbon dioxide added to the mixture is removed by the scrubber and therefore does not affect the equation)

Oxygen partial pressure in the DCSC is controlled by the flow rate of feed gas through the dosage regulator and the oxygen consumption of the diver. Dump rate is equal to feed rate minus oxygen consumption for this case.

The change in the fraction of oxygen &lt;math&gt;dF_{O_2loop}&lt;/math&gt; in the breathing circuit may be described by the following equation:&lt;ref name="CMF" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V_{loop}*dF_{O_2loop}=(Q_{feed}*F_{O_2feed}-V_{O_2}-(Q_{feed}-V_{O_2})*F_{O_2loop})dt&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;V_{loop}&lt;/math&gt; = volume of the breathing circuit
:&lt;math&gt;Q_{feed}&lt;/math&gt; = flow rate of the fresh gas supplied by the orifice
:&lt;math&gt;F_{O_2feed}&lt;/math&gt; = oxygen fraction of the supply gas
:&lt;math&gt;V_{O_2}&lt;/math&gt; = oxygen uptake flow rate of the diver

This leads to the differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dF_{O_2loop}}{dt}=\frac{(Q_{feed}*F_{O_2feed}-V_{O_2}(t)-(Q_{feed}-V_{O_2})*F_{O_2loop}(t))}{V_{loop}}&lt;/math&gt;

With solution:

:&lt;math&gt;F_{O_2loop}(t)=\frac{Q_{feed}*F_{O_2feed}-V_{O_2}}{Q_{feed}-V_{O_2}}+(F_{O_2loop}^{start}-\frac{Q_{feed}*F_{O_2feed}-V_{O_2}}{Q_{feed}-V_{O_2}})*e^{-\frac{Q_{feed}-V_{O_2}}{V_{loop}}t}&lt;/math&gt;

Which comprises a steady state and a transient term.

The steady state term is sufficient for most calculations:

The steady state oxygen fraction in the breathing circuit, &lt;math&gt;F_{O_2loop}&lt;/math&gt;, can be calculated from the formula:&lt;ref name="CMF" &gt;Larsson, A. (2000) ''Åke’s Constant Mass Flow Rebreather Technical Page'' http://www.teknosofen.com/cmf_scr_tech.htm Access date 2 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F_{O_2loop}=\frac{(Q_{feed}*F_{O_2feed}-V_{O_2})}{(Q_{feed}-V_{O_2})}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;Q_{feed}&lt;/math&gt; = Flow rate of fresh gas supplied by the orifice
:&lt;math&gt;V_{O_2}&lt;/math&gt; = Oxygen uptake flow rate of the diver 
:&lt;math&gt;F_{O_2feed}&lt;/math&gt; = Oxygen fraction of the supply gas
in a consistent system of units.

As oxygen consumption is an independent variable, a fixed feed rate will give a range of possible oxygen fractions for any given depth. In the interests of safety, the range can be determined by calculating oxygen fraction for maximum and minimum oxygen consumption as well as the expected rate.

Feed gas flow is a function of respiratory minute volume at surface pressure and the dosage ratio based on the dosage chamber volume. The values for dosage ratio are 60% for the large chamber and 30% for the small chamber.

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{feed}=K_{dosage}*V_{RM}&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of the first equation into this yields:

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{feed}=K_{dosage}*K_E*V_{O_2}&lt;/math&gt;

This may be substituted into the steady state term to give:

:&lt;math&gt;F_{O_2loop}=\frac{(K_{dosage}*K_E*V_{O_2}*F_{O_2feed}-V_{O_2})}{(K_{dosage}*K_E*V_{O_2}-V_{O_2})}&lt;/math&gt;

Which simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt;F_{O_2loop}=\frac{(K_{dosage}*K_E*F_{O_2feed}-1)}{(K_{dosage}*K_E*-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that there is no dependency depth or on oxygen uptake, and since the dosage ratio is constant once the gas has been selected, it is clear that the variations remaining are due to variations in the extraction ratio. This means that the DCSC has theoretically the most stable oxygen fraction of the semi-closed rebreathers and is a reasonable approximation of open circuit for decompression purposes.&lt;ref name="Larsson 2000" /&gt;  The unit has been used by the Swedish armed forces for over 15 years with a good safety record. However a large decompression stress when using air tables for decompression on dives using a 28% nitrox supply gas has been indicated by the presence of high venous gas emboli (VGE) scores post-dive. Oxygen fraction in the loop was not monitored during these tests.&lt;ref name=Gennser2011 /&gt;

==Gas endurance==

The reserve valve is activated at about 25 bar. A 5-litre cylinder at 200 bar will provide about (200-25)*5 litres = 875 free gas at 1 bar available for the dive. A RMV of 30 l/min for a diver working moderately hard,&lt;ref name="NOAA" &gt;''NOAA Diving Manual, 4th Edition'' CD-ROM prepared and distributed by the National Technical Information Service (NTIS)in partnership with NOAA and Best Publishing Company, FIGURE 3.10, Oxygen Consumption and RMV at Different Work Rates&lt;/ref&gt; using the 28% nitrox with a dosage ratio of 0,6 will use the gas in 875/(30*0.6) = 48 min. The 46% nitrox with a dosage ratio of 0.3 will last 875/(30*0.3) = 97 min. A 15 l/min RMV for light work&lt;ref name="NOAA" /&gt; will double these times.

==Scrubber endurance==

The scrubber capacity is 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg of soda lime. If a conservative value of 100 litres CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per kg is used, the capacity of the scrubber will be 2.5*100 = 250 litres CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. At an extraction rate of 1/20 and a dosage rate of 0.3, some 875/0.3*1/20 = 146 litres of carbon dioxide may be produced by the diver, showing that endurance is not limited by the scrubber.&lt;ref name="Larsson 2000" /&gt;

[[File:LN3-2A Platform MVC-876X.JPG|thumb|upright=1.14|LN3-2A Inertial Platform at RNlAF Electronics Museum, Rhenen, The Netherlands.]]

The '''LN-3 inertial navigation system''' is an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS) that was developed in the 1960s by [[Litton Industries]]. It equipped the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] versions used as [[strike aircraft]] in European forces. An inertial navigation system is a system which continually determines the position of a vehicle from measurements made entirely within the vehicle using sensitive instruments. These instruments are [[accelerometer]]s which detect and measure vehicle accelerations, and [[gyroscope]]s which act to hold the accelerometers in proper orientation.

== Background ==
[[File:LN3-2A Platform P3170762.JPG|thumb|LN3-2A Platform in historic environment]]

The development of Litton's first INS was the result of a collusive act by the engineer, Max Lipscomb of the [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright Air Force Base]] in Ohio and Dr. [[Henry Earl Singleton|Henry E. Singleton]], Head of the newly formed Guidance and Control Dept. of Litton Industries at Beverly Hills, California.

Lipscomb's department was not permitted to engage in development of navigation systems, but was permitted to engage in other aircraft [[avionics]] such as pitch, roll, and yaw indicators. Singleton proposed to provide a system that would provide highly accurate pitch, roll, and yaw indicators. The system would be a north seeking stable platform controlled by [[gyroscope]]s and accelerometers. Such a system would automatically provide velocities in the East-West and North-South direction. And later, by providing integrators for these two axes, one would then have a full-fledged Inertial Navigation System.

In about mid-1956 a contract for approximately $300,000 was awarded by Wright Air Force Base to Litton Industries for the development of such "Aircraft Attitude System." Singleton appointed Sidney Shapiro as Project Engineer for this program. The system was completed and ready for flight test by the end of 1958.

Mr. Shapiro selected [[Paul Mantz]], a partner in [[Frank Tallman|Tallmantz]] Aviation, to supply the aircraft, principally because of Mantz's extensive experience with the movie industry. They had done their work on several Cinerama travelogs. Mantz's people had also recently finished work on the picture "North by Northwest" starring Cary Grant in which there was considerable stunt flying. Shapiro's idea was to photograph the ground periodically and at the same instant to photograph the Inertial Navigation System's output. In that way no possibility of finger pointing was possible since none of Shapiro's people were involved in the data taking. So the two extra integrators were installed and the system was ready for test by early 1959.

By 1959 things had gone well enough that Shapiro was able to obtain three successive flights in which the accuracies were substantially better than one mile an hour. On the basis of these results, Litton Industries was awarded a contract to provide 2000 systems for the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F104 NATO Fighter]] Aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Lipscomb and Wilbur (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cold War]] missile race spurred the development of smaller, lighter and more accurate inertial systems. Independent of its environment, the inertial system provides velocity and position information accurately and instantaneously for all manoeuvres, as well as being an accurate attitude and heading reference. The LN3-2A was the first inertial navigation system small and light and accurate enough to be fitted in a high performance fighter.

The early F-104's, model A through F, did not have an Inertial Navigator. It was the development of the F-104G, around 1959, for the European Air Forces with tactical bomber/strike capabilities, that brought the LN-3 into the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (1963), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; The LN-3 gave the F-104G the capability to navigate at low level in adverse weather and to drop a nuclear weapon at a range of 1,000&amp;nbsp;km with the best possible precision; this being vital to the F-104G program.

The LN-3 is a full 3-degrees-of-freedom, 4-gimbal inertial navigator, covering the flight performance envelope of the F-104G which ranged from 0 to 70,000 feet altitude; 0 to Mach 2+ speed, and accelerations from −5 to +9 g.

== Functional description ==
The functional description of the LN3-2A requires some knowledge of some basic principles of inertial navigation to understand their application to the LN3-2A. The principal component of the system is the stable platform to which are mounted three accelerometers and two gyros. This stable platform is mounted in a system of platform gimbals. The acceleration of the airplane in any plane or direction is measured by the accelerometers and integrated in the computer to obtain velocity. Velocities in turn are integrated to obtain distance. With a known reference point representing initial position of the airplane with respect to earth, this data can be converted to distance and heading traveled, and distance and bearing to destination.

=== Platform ===
The following characteristics of the ''platform'' are described:&lt;ref&gt;F-104G Starfighter Maintenance Manual.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Three accelerometers in orthogonal directions provide the basic sensing elements. They measure acceleration along the two grid coordinate axes and the vertical (Z) axis. The Z accelerometer is not used by the LN3-2A itself but provides vertical acceleration data for the automatic flight control system. The east-west and north-south X and Y axes are used for the LN3-2A. The accelerometer outputs torque the gyros in their sensitive axes, while the airplane is in flight, to maintain earth and grid north orientation of the stable platform through the platform gimbals.
# Two gyros stabilize the stable platform and provide for various compensations to be introduced, keeping the stable platform level with respect to earth instead of inertial space, and providing a coordinate reference system of three axes. The gyros each have two degrees of freedom, and are oriented so that the spin axes are 90 degrees apart. The upper gyro has its spin axis oriented along the north-south grid coordinate axis and is sensitive to torques (airplane rotations) about the east-west and vertical coordinate axes. The lower gyro has its spin axis oriented along the east-west grid axis and is sensitive to torques about the north-south and vertical axes. Therefore, the two gyros control all three axes.
# Platform gimbals are the assemblies which actually keep the platform accelerometers stable and enable the airplane to maneuver about the gyro-stabilized earth-oriented platform. The LN3-2A platform is a four-gimbal system (outer roll, pitch, inner roll and azimuth) allowing the airplane 360 degrees of rotation in all directions. The azimuth, pitch and outer roll gimbals use sliprings and brushes for electrical contacts to allow unlimited freedom. The inner roll gimbal provides a built-in redundancy to prevent a [[gimbal lock]] situation when the azimuth and outer roll gimbal axes become aligned at 90 degrees of pitch.

=== Computer ===
The LN3-2A ''computer'' controls the platform, computes navigational information and provides special AC and DC voltages required for equipment operation.

The functions of the computer are:

# to position the azimuth, pitch and roll gimbals of the platform. The basic sequence is that the gyro precession error due to airplane maneuvering is sensed and fed to the platform azimuth synchro resolver. The gyro signals are resolved into pitch and roll error voltages which are amplified in the computer. The computer drives the platform roll and pitch gimbal servo motors. The lower gyro is torqued to precess in azimuth to drive the azimuth gimbal motors. The upper gyro is caged to the lower gyro in azimuth. The gimbal servo motors position the gimbals to compensate for the original deviation.
# to provide the voltages for the starting and running of the gyro spin motors. During the start of the system the gyros are brought up to spin speed by airplane 115 V AC, 400&amp;nbsp;Hz power. After the 1 minute coarse align phase the frequency source for the gyros is an electric tuning fork which provides a 3&amp;nbsp;kHz reference frequency which is divided by 8 to provide an operating frequency of 375&amp;nbsp;Hz and a running voltage of 90 volts.
# to control the heating of the component oven, the platform, the gyros and the accelerometers. Some circuits within the computer, like amplifiers, require a very stable amplification factor which can only be maintained if certain components are kept at a precisely held temperature. These components are placed within the Component Oven at 71&amp;nbsp;°C.  Also the gyros and accelerometers are kept at 71&amp;nbsp;°C ± 1.1&amp;nbsp;°C.  The ambient atmospheric temperature inside the platform is maintained at 51.7&amp;nbsp;°C by a set of heaters and a circulating fan, and a motor driven cooling air valve controlling the flow of pressurized air through the double walled platform cover.
# to compute velocity and distance information from acceleration. These navigational computations are performed with carefully designed electronic circuits in harmony with precision electromechanical components. The electronic parts are the Accelerometer Restoring Amplifier which give a voltage that is proportional to the acceleration. Ranging from micro-G's to units of G they span a very impressive dynamic range. Also the Servo Amplifiers, picking off the tiny Gyro signals and amplifying this to control the platform gimbal motors, have tight specifications. The actual integration of the accelerometer signal to a velocity signal is performed by an electronic amplifier which controls a velocity-motor which drives a capacitance tachometer. This cap-tach feedback provides the basic integrator signal since the speed of the cap-tach is proportional to acceleration input. The feedback nulls the acceleration input to stop the motor. The motor positions the velocity shaft to pick off the appropriate potentiometer signal which represents velocity. A dead zone network drives the velocity motor in steps which are smoothed to provide the integrated acceleration (= velocity) signal. The velocity integrators operate in a similar manner to the acceleration integrators, except that the output signal is not smoothed because the so-called M-transmitters are step-function devices. The M-transmitters send the integrated velocity (= distance) signal to the Position and Homing System PHI-4.
# to sequence and control the coarse- and fine-align phases in conjunction with platform temperature.
# to sense malfunctions to actuate the go, no-go circuitry of the inertial navigator.
# Since the LN-3/PHI-4 navigation system is to be used around the globe of the earth, some systematic corrections for use on this rotating spheroid are implemented in the LN-3: Earth rate, Transport rate, and Coriolis correction.  And to suppress inherent errors the system is [[Schuler tuning|Schuler tuned]].

== Operation of the LN-3 ==
Before starting the Inertial navigator, the pilot has to enter the coordinates of the starting point in the "Align Control" panel in the right-hand console of the F-104G.
The first selection in the starting sequence is to rotate the mode selector switch of the "Inertial Navigation Control" Panel from ''Off'' to ''Standby''.

In this mode the platform and component oven are brought up to [[operating temperature]]; indicated by the "heat" light on the IN Control Panel, which takes several minutes depending on outside and system temperatures.

All at operating temperature the system may be switched to "''Align''", allowing the machine to commence operation. The computer is powered up and nulls its velocity shafts; the gyros are powered by 115 V and 400&amp;nbsp;Hz and revving up; the platform is levelled in pitch, inner and outer roll relative to the aircraft using the gimbal synchrotransmitters; and the azimuth axis is driven to the grid north direction using the magnetic heading sensor. This phase of Alignment takes 1 minute and is called coarse align.

After this 1 minute the system switches to the ''fine align phase'', during which the gyro spin motor power is brought down to 95 V and 375&amp;nbsp;Hz to avoid any magnetic interference with any other aircraft system using 400&amp;nbsp;Hz. The levelling of the platform is taken over by the X and Y accelerometers sensing even the smallest component of gravity which is an indication of not being precisely level. The levelling of the stable element is achieved by torquing the respective gyro torquers which makes the gimbal motors to follow up and level the stable element. The distance shafts are set to zero; the gyros are at operational speed and the computer is continuously feeding the gyros, and thereby the stable element, with corrections for local earth rotation. This is called the ''levelling phase of fine align''.

Leveling ends automatically when the computer decides that the platform stable element is exactly locally level, which may take a few minutes. If level, the final phase of alignment is switched on; ''gyrocompassing''.
The stable element is exactly level and [[Schuler tuning|Schuler-tuned]] but the gyros are not yet aligned with the earth rotation axis. Therefore, the stable element tends to turn off-level, which is sensed by the Y accelerometer which signal is fed to the gyro torquer to rotate the azimuth axis of the stable element. This process continues for a few minutes until the correction signal is getting smaller and can be kept almost zero for 50 seconds, which gives confidence that the system is level and aligned. This is visible for the pilot because the green Nav light flashes.

The system is now ready for use and the pilot selects "''Nav''" on the IN Control Panel, and all circuitry that was involved in the various alignment phases is switched to the ''navigate mode''.

Other possible modes are ''Compass only'' which may be selected after a LN3 in-flight failure, and ''Alert Align'' to shorten the alignment phase. After the last flight but before shutting down aircraft power the precise heading of the running LN3 is stored and can be used at starting up the next time, if the aircraft is not moved.

=== Performance ===
Specified navigation accuracy for the LN-3 is a 50% circular-error probability of two nautical miles after one hour's operation, which is equivalent to a 98% c.e.p. of four nautical miles. Until the −9 version of the LN-3-2A came into service (~1963) results were outside these limits by a fair margin, but since then it has been greatly exceeded in a number of groups of flights.

During manufacturer's development flying at Palmdale, some 1167 flights were made up to October 1961, and the c.e.p. of the LN-3 and PHI-4 combined was a mile or so outside specification. From October 1961 to January 1962 a further 123 flights at Palmdale were assessed, following incorporation of the −9 modifications, and the c.e.p. came almost up to specification.

At Edwards AFB, during Category 2 testing, and at Palmdale during the "avionics marriage" period, mean time between failures of pre-9 systems was considerably below the 200 hr specified, but the target has been exceeded since then.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (1963), p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genealogy ==
Litton Systems Inc., or [[Litton Industries]], the Guidance and Control Systems Division at Beverly Hills CA, were one of the major producers of inertial systems in the USA in the 50's and 60's, and have made a series of systems for a number of American aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (1963), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Genesis of inertial navigation systems is explained in the following reference.

* The '''LN-1''' was a development attitude reference for the XB-70 Valkyrie.&lt;ref&gt;Bertram.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''LN-1A''' was a precision attitude reference for the Grumman E-1A Tracer.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (1963), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parsch (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''LN-2A''' (military designation AN/ASN-31 or −36) was a Doppler-inertial system for the A-6A Intruder
* The '''LN-2B''' was the system for the E-2A Hawkeye,
* and the '''LN-2C''' was the system for the P-3A Orion.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (1963), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parsch (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''LN-3-2A''' (or '''LN3-2A''') was the Inertial Navigation System used in the F-104G Super Starfighter.  (development 195?–195?, production 1960-196?) Improved versions of the LN3-2A were −9, −11 and −13.&lt;ref&gt;F-104G Starfighter Maintenance Manual.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''LN-3-2B''' is the Inertial Navigation System used in the Canadian CF-104.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (1963), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''LN-3-13''' is fitted to the Italian F-104S/CI and F-104S/CB;&lt;ref&gt;Goebel (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; enhanced variants of the F-104G from 1969 and onward. In the early 80's a further upgrade led to the F-104S ASA version which kept the original LN-3; but the ASA-M version of the '90s was equipped with the LN-30A2 inertial navigation system.&lt;ref&gt;Baugher (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''LN-4''' is a miniature inertial system for "a manned orbital vehicle"&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (1963), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''LN-5''' is a (1963)"state of the art experimentation astro-inertial system installed in a Convair 340 R4Y ".&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (1963), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''LN-7''' is an astro-inertial-Doppler system for a classified application.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (1963), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''LN-12A/B''' series are an evolution of the LN-3 and are used in F-4C (AN/ASN-48), the F-4D and F-4E (AN/ASN-63), the RF-4C (AN/ASN-56), all with slight differences.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The gimballed platform of the LN3-2A is the Litton P200 platform; the Gyro is the G200 Gyro; and the accelerometer is the A200 accelerometer.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (1963), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; (and Litton doc)
The G-200 Gyro is commonly used in the LN-2, LN-3 and the LN-12 systems.&lt;ref&gt;Navhouse Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LN3-2A designation ===
Manufacturers designation of the F-104G system is LN3-2A. Mark the difference in notation LN-3 and LN3-2A with the position of the dividing dash "-" .
The designation LN3-2A leaves room for a LN3-1, not known to author. Any additional information about the early Litton's is welcome!

== Other US inertial systems of the early 1960's ==
The Litton LN-3 was one of the first inertial navigators on a production aircraft, but other systems, either inertial navigators or inertial measurement units, of other brands and for various applications with comparable technology existed.

The Autonetics Radar Enhanced Inertial Navigation System (REINS) of the [[North American A-5 Vigilante]] was more or less comparable to the LN-3/PHI-4. This system was derived from the XN-6 system developed for the [[SM-64 Navaho]], the N5G system for the [[AGM-28 Hound Dog]] and the N2C/N2J/N3A/N3B system for the [[XB-70]], and was related to the N6A-1 navigation system used in the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)]] and the N10 inertial guidance system for the [[LGM-30 Minuteman]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boeing.com/history/narrative/n067nar.html&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the Boeing history claims the REINS to be the first inertial navigation in a production airplane.

Nortronics had developed and produced [[Astro-inertial guidance]]/navigation systems for the [[SM-62 Snark]]. The system developed for the [[GAM-87 Skybolt]] was later adapted for use in the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird]] and mostly referred to as NAS-14 and/or NAS-21.

The [[UGM-27 Polaris]] missile was equipped with a MIT-developed inertial system, which later evolved to the Delco produced IMU of the [[Apollo PGNCS]].

The [[Saturn V]] was equipped with a MSFC-developed [[ST-124-M3 inertial platform]] which was a further development of the [[PGM-19 Jupiter]]'s ST-90.

The [[Convair B-58 Hustler]] was equipped by AN/ASQ-42 Dopler-inertial system, made by [[Sperry Corporation]].

== LN-3 maintenance and test equipment ==
The LN-3 system was designed to constantly monitor critical parameters, and warn the pilot in case of a malfunction. Depending on the problem the pilot could switch-off the system, or continue in a [[dead reckoning]] mode. In case of serious self-diagnosed problems the system would auto shut-down.

=== Flight line maintenance ===
Flight line maintenance of the LN-3, like systemchecks and fault isolation, was performed using specific test equipment :
[[File:Vkl navshop STC en pedestal 1980 PBurgers.jpg|thumb|System Test Console with Adapter and Computer, and Platform on pedestal at Volkel, NL]]

* MATS (mobile automated test system) (RNlAF operated the MATS not at flightline but shop level.)
* Line test analyzer
* Gyro bias test set

=== Base level maintenance ===
At base (nav)shop level the platform, computer and adapter units were tested and repaired using the following test equipment :

* System test console (STC).
* Bench test console (BTC).

[[File:DELM PFTC waarschijnlijk foto van DELM-DVD.JPG|thumb|Platform functional test console and platform on pedestal at DELM, Rhenen, NL]]

=== Depot level maintenance ===
For repairs beyond the capabilities of base level, the RNlAF Electronics Depot (DELM, at Rhenen) was equipped with specific testequipment and tooling to handle the (higher) depot level repairs of the LN-3 system.

The main test stations in use were:

* Platform functional test console (PFTC).
* Module test console.

=== Industry support ===
The repair of the system's sensors, gyros and accelerometers, was performed by Litton. The RNlAF had its sensors repaired by Litton Canada, which also provided all necessary spare parts.
Other European users relied on German or Italian subsidiaries/licensees as LITEF at Freiburg and Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (1963), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of ovens'''. An [[oven]] is a thermally insulated chamber used for the [[heating]], [[baking]] or [[drying]] of a substance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oven Oven]. Merriam-webster.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and most commonly used for [[cooking]]. [[Kiln]]s and [[furnace]]s are special-purpose ovens, used in [[pottery]] and [[metalworking]], respectively.

==Ovens==

===Baking ovens===
[[Baking]] is a food [[cooking]] method that uses prolonged dry heat by [[convection]], rather than by [[thermal radiation]], normally in an oven, but also in hot ashes, or on hot stones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Bread is a commonly baked food.

===Earth ovens===
An [[earth oven]], or cooking pit, is one of the most simple and long-used cooking structures. At its simplest, an earth oven is a pit in the ground used to trap heat and bake, smoke, or steam food. Earth ovens have been used in many places and cultures in the past, and the presence of such cooking pits is a key sign of human settlement often sought by [[archaeologists]].  They remain a common tool for cooking large quantities of food where no equipment is available.

===Kilns===
A [[kiln]] is a thermally insulated chamber, a type of oven, that produces temperatures sufficient to complete some process, such as hardening, drying, or chemical changes. Various industries and trades use kilns to harden objects made from [[clay]] into [[pottery]], [[brick]]s etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioenergylists.org/stovesdoc/Goyer/Kilns/Goyer_Kilns_and_Brick_Making.pdf |title=Brick making kilns |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various industries use [[rotary kiln]]s for [[pyroprocessing]]—to calcinate ores, produce [[Cement kiln|cement]], lime, and many other materials.

{{nihongo|'''Nintendo Labo'''|ニンテンドーラボ|Nintendō Rabo}} is a gaming and [[construction toy]] platform developed by [[Nintendo]] and used as an extension for the [[Nintendo Switch]] video game console, which was released in April 2018. The platform uses kits that include cardboard cut-outs and other materials that are to be assembled in combination with the Nintendo Switch console display and [[Joy-Con]] controllers to create "'''Toy-Con'''" that can interact with game software and vice versa. Nintendo designed Labo as a way to teach principles of engineering, physics, and basic programming.

==Construction and gameplay==
[[File:Nintendo Labo fishing rod.jpeg|thumb|right|The fishing rod Toy-Con interacting with the Switch console (encased on the right side of the image). Joy-Con are embedded in both the "reel" on the rod and within the base holding the Switch console.]]
Nintendo Labo is released as individual Labo Kits, each containing a set of pre-made cardboard cut-outs and other materials, used to make one or more "Toy-Con", and a Nintendo Switch game card, which contains interactive instructions on how to assemble the Toy-Con and software that the Toy-Con can interact with. Once each Toy-Con is constructed, players insert the main Nintendo Switch display and/or one or both of the [[Joy-Con]] controllers according to the instructions. Each Toy-Con functions differently in the ways it interacts with either the Joy-Con or the main display. For example, the piano Toy-Con's keystrokes are read by the Right Joy-Con controller's [[infrared]] sensor to identify notes being played, while robotic Toy-Con move using HD Rumble from the Joy-Con controllers, which are controlled via the touchscreen. Players may freely decorate the cardboard parts using coloring pens, tape, and other materials, while more experienced users can invent new ways to play with each Toy-Con.&lt;ref name="verge announce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian announce"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jan/17/nintendo-labo-cardboard-switch-models-interactive-toys|title='Like cardboard Lego': Nintendo Labo turns homemade models into interactive toys|last=McDonald|first=Keza|date=January 17, 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117233126/https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jan/17/nintendo-labo-cardboard-switch-models-interactive-toys|archivedate=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|accessdate=January 17, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game software provides instructions on how the Toy-Con works with the Switch, such as describing the fundamentals of [[infrared sensor|infrared sensing]].&lt;ref name="verge announce" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/nintendo-labo-hands-on-switch-brilliant-barmy-cardboard-toys/|title=Nintendo Labo - Hands-on with the Switch's brilliant and barmy cardboard toys|last=Hoggins|first=Tom|date=January 17, 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117223914/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/nintendo-labo-hands-on-switch-brilliant-barmy-cardboard-toys/|archivedate=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|accessdate=January 17, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toy-Con Garage ===
The Nintendo Labo software comes with a feature called "Toy-Con Garage", which allows users to create and program their own Toy-Con using simple programming commands, either starting with the available Labo kits, or with their own materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/1/16960622/nintendo-labo-toy-con-garage-custom-feature | title = Nintendo Labo Toy-Con Garage lets you make your own custom playthings | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = February 1, 2018 | accessdate = February 1, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180202012815/https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/1/16960622/nintendo-labo-toy-con-garage-custom-feature | archivedate = February 2, 2018 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toy-Con Garage is based upon creating simple commands by connecting input and output nodes. When an input is performed, it will trigger the connected output event. Additional middle nodes can be added to modify the input. For example, an input node can be a specific button press or a controller movement, while the middle node can set a required number of presses in order for the output to occur. Output nodes range from vibrating the Joy-Con to lighting up the Console's display. Toy-Con Garage provides multiple options for customizing each node, such as adjusting the sensitivity and direction of the control stick as an input node. Multiple input-output commands can be used in combination to create more complex creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/new-nintendo-labo-vid-details-toy-con-garage-programming-w517889 | title = New 'Nintendo Labo' Vid Details Toy-Con Garage Programming | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = March 15, 2018 | accessdate = March 15, 2018 | work = [[Glixel]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180315140537/https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/new-nintendo-labo-vid-details-toy-con-garage-programming-w517889 | archivedate = March 15, 2018 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Labo was announced on January 17, 2018. According to [[Nintendo of America]] president [[Reggie Fils-Aimé]], "Labo is unlike anything we've done before", and was developed to extend the age audience for the Switch.&lt;ref name="verge announce"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/17/16900496/nintendo-switch-labo-cardboard-diy-accessories-announced-price-release-date | title = Nintendo is making a bunch of weird DIY cardboard toys for the Switch and they’re awesome | first = Andrew | last = Webster | date = January 17, 2018 | accessdate = January 17, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180117220704/https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/17/16900496/nintendo-switch-labo-cardboard-diy-accessories-announced-price-release-date | archivedate = January 17, 2018 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo said the product was "specifically crafted for kids and those who are kids at heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/17/16900626/nintendo-switch-tease-new-interactive-experience-kids-at-heart|title=What is Nintendo teasing for the Switch?

The product was not originally intended to be educational, though one of its goals was to "explain how the technology behind the Toy-Con creations works".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://labo.nintendo.com/developer-interview/its-fun/|title=Developer Interview: It's fun to "Make, Play, and Discover" - Nintendo Labo Official Site|last=|first=|date=|website=labo.nintendo.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nintendo Labo construction.jpeg|thumb|right|A Toy-Con being constructed from punch-outs from cardboard sheets with instructions via the Switch Labo software]]
The concept of Labo came from Nintendo when they asked their employees to come up with ways that the Switch's Joy-Con could be used; out of many potential ideas, the idea of building cardboard toys around the controllers held promise. According to [[Shinya Takahashi]], the use of cardboard as part of playthings is a common practice among Japanese children, and as they started prototyping ideas, they found the "trial and error" process of putting together the cardboard toys was "extremely fun".&lt;ref name="glixel origins"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/pictures/nintendo-talks-labo-origins-and-switch-proliferation-w516556|title=Nintendo Talks Labo Origins and Wanting "Every Single Person" To Own A Switch|last=Hester|first=Blake|date=February 9, 2018|work=[[Glixel]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210003107/https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/pictures/nintendo-talks-labo-origins-and-switch-proliferation-w516556|archivedate=February 10, 2018|deadurl=no|accessdate=February 9, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Labo concept was developed, they found it fit well within Nintendo's overall philosophy on innovating new ways to have fun, and had potential to introduce the Switch to more than just game enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="glixel origins" /&gt;

Nintendo Labo developers Kawamoto, Sakaguchi, and Ogasawara stated in an interview that their goal was to use the unique features of the Nintendo Switch in such a way that no other system could emulate. The Joy-Con were treated as a "bundle of sensors" that could be used in a multitude of ways by attaching them to different hardware pieces, focusing on the gyro [[Motion sensor (gaming)|motion-sensor]], [[Ir sensor|IR motion]] camera, and [[HD Rumble]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://labo.nintendo.com/developer-interview/|title=Developer Interview - Nintendo Labo Official Site|last=|first=|date=|website=labo.nintendo.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was tasked with exploring Joy-Con attachment and game prototypes during three weeks of brainstorming sessions, called "prototype parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://labo.nintendo.com/developer-interview-part-2/|title=Developer Interview Part 2 - Nintendo Labo Official Site|last=|first=|date=|website=labo.nintendo.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://labo.nintendo.com/developer-interview-part-2/a-crossteam-collaboration/|title=Developer Interview: A cross-team collaboration - Nintendo Labo Official Site|last=|first=|date=|website=labo.nintendo.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about the choice of building material, the developers responded by saying that cardboard was chosen over plastic because the 3D printer they were using for prototyping was unable to keep up with their pace of testing; cardboard would also allow for the player to create, repair, and customize the project themselves.&lt;ref name="devinterview cardboard"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://labo.nintendo.com/developer-interview-part-2/why-we-decided-to-use-cardboard/|title=Developer Interview: Why we decided to use cardboard - Nintendo Labo Official Site|last=|first=|date=|website=labo.nintendo.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial construction designs were first thought as being simple to construct, but later proved to be complex and challenging when it was decided that no cutting or gluing would be required to assemble the kits. Improvements were made to the prototypes based on feedback from consumer and developer testing; this prompted the creation of the interactive instruction software, as well as favoring simplicity over appearance. During development testing—prior to the cardboard designs being finalized—photographs were taken and compiled into booklets to be used as temporary instruction manuals; these booklets ranged from 1,000 pages for simpler models to 3,000 pages for complex ones.&lt;ref name="devinterview test"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://labo.nintendo.com/developer-interview/consumer-test/|title=Developer Interview: An eye-opening consumer test - Nintendo Labo Official Site|last=|first=|date=|website=labo.nintendo.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the cardboard Toy-Con are sturdy, Nintendo recognized that the cardboard can suffer wear and tear with time, and sells replacement sheets for individual Toy-Con through its online store.&lt;ref name="guardian announce" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NEreplacement"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendos-online-store-now-has-replacement-parts-for-nintendo-labo/|title=Nintendo's online store now has replacement parts for Nintendo Labo - Nintendo Everything|last=|first=|date=April 19, 2018|work=Nintendo Everything|access-date=April 20, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LaboFAQ"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://labo.nintendo.com/faq/|title=Nintendo Labo™ for the Nintendo Switch™ home gaming system - Toy-Con Garage|last=|first=|date=|website=labo.nintendo.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about the durability of Labo during an interview with [[CNET]], Yoshiyasu Ogasawara stated, "We tested their resilience to the same action through hundreds and thousands of repetitions, so we expect them to last a long time under normal use."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/nintendo-labo-questions-answered-creators-nintendo-switch/|title=How long will Nintendo Labo's cardboard last?

Starting in October 2018, Nintendo worked with the [[Institute of Play]] to bring Nintendo Labo into elementary schools, with an initial goal to reach 2,000 students by the end of the 2018-2019 school year. Nintendo is providing the Switch and Labo kits, while the Institute is developing the lesson plans for teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18009754/nintendo-labo-teacher-guide-educational-school | title=  Nintendo is bringing Labo to schools across North America this year | first = Andrew | last = Webster | date = October 23, 2018 | accessdate = October 23, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labo Kits==
Two Labo Kits, Variety Kit and Robot Kit, were announced for launch in North America, Australia, and Japan on April 20, 2018, and in Europe on April 27, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/17/16902886/nintendo-switch-labo-cardboard-toy-con-price-release-date-trailer|title=Nintendo reveals Labo, a DIY ‘build-and-play experience’ for Switch|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=January 17, 2018|website=Polygon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118034148/https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/17/16902886/nintendo-switch-labo-cardboard-toy-con-price-release-date-trailer|archive-date=2018-01-18|dead-url=no|access-date=January 17, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An accessory set containing stencils, stickers, and tape are available separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/17/16902888/nintendo-switch-labo-price-release-date-video-trailer-details-cardboard-toy-con-accessories|title=Nintendo Labo: Everything we know|last=Frank|first=Allegra|date=January 17, 2018|website=Polygon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118122619/https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/17/16902888/nintendo-switch-labo-price-release-date-video-trailer-details-cardboard-toy-con-accessories|archive-date=2018-01-18|dead-url=no|access-date=January 17, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replacement packs for individual parts and Toy-Con are available for purchase on Nintendo's online store,&lt;ref name="NEreplacement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LaboFAQ" /&gt; while free templates for the cardboard cut-outs are also available for download.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2018/04/20/yes-you-can-download-replacement-labo-templates-for-free|title=Yes, You Can Download Replacement Labo Templates For Free|last=Dale|first=Laura Kate|date=April 20, 2018|website=Kotaku UK|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Nintendo did not confirm any additional Toy-Con kits at launch, journalists observed that other Toy-Con configurations were shown in the announce trailer, suggesting that additional kits may be announced at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/nintendo-labo-trailer-teases-future-toy-cons | title = Nintendo Labo Trailer Teases Future Toy-Cons | first = Nadia | last = Oxford | date = January 18, 2018 | accessdate = January 18, 2018 | work = [[US Gamer]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180119060646/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/nintendo-labo-trailer-teases-future-toy-cons | archivedate = January 19, 2018 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/18/16905036/nintendo-labo-trailer-new-kit | title = Nintendo Labo reveal teased a lot of unannounced Toy-Cons | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = January 18, 2018 | accessdate = January 18, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180118183811/https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/18/16905036/nintendo-labo-trailer-new-kit | archivedate = January 18, 2018 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variety Kit===
[[File:Nintendo labo rc car.jpeg|thumb|right|The remote-controlled "car" Toy-Con, with the two Joy-Con attached to the sides and controlled by the Switch console (held by the person in the background)]]
The Variety Kit contains kits for five individual Toy-Con:
* Two remote-controlled cars, where the vibrations from the Joy-Con serve to provide momentum and steering to the car. The game software allows the player to control the car like a normal remote-controlled vehicle using the console itself as the controller. The software also allows for the car to follow targets using the IR motion camera of the right Joy-Con. 
* A fishing rod where the Joy-Con sit in the reel and the handle of the rod. The game receives motion input from the Joy-Con to simulate a fishing game.
* A toy piano with a full octave of keys; the console sits atop this to serve as a music stand.
* A motorbike with Joy-Con inserted into the handlebars on either side of the Console for steering. The Toy-Con Motorbike is also compatible as a motion controller in ''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-now-supports-nintendo-labo-1827121784|title=Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Now Supports Nintendo Labo|last=Plunkett|first=Luke|date=June 25, 2018|work=Kotaku|access-date=June 26, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A house containing a slot to insert different components that can interact with the game software on the Console's display.

The kit comes with a game cartridge that contains interactive instructions of how to assemble each Toy-Con, and at least one software package to use the Toy-Con. Some Toy-Con have multiple programs; for example, the motorbike handles allow the player to race along a track in stunt bikes, and gives the player the ability to create new track layouts, or to use any object detected through the IR sensor to create a track based on that object. Similar IR sensing abilities allows the player to create new fish to catch in the fishing rod Toy-Con, or to create new waveforms to use on the piano Toy-Con.&lt;ref name="labo software"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/the-games-behind-the-cardboard-we-finally-know-how-nintendo-labo-will-play/ | title = The games behind the cardboard: We finally know how Nintendo Labo will play | first = Sam | last = Mackovech | date = February 14, 2018 | accessdate = February 15, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180215062658/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/the-games-behind-the-cardboard-we-finally-know-how-nintendo-labo-will-play/ | archivedate = February 15, 2018 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robot Kit===
[[File:Nintendo Lab robot kit.jpeg|thumb|right|A user using the Robot kit to interact with the game on the Switch unit (right)]]
The Robot Kit includes parts to make a [[mecha]] suit that includes a visor which holds the left Joy-Con for motion sensing and a backpack that holds the right Joy-Con to read hand and feet swings. This allows the player to rampage through a virtual world presented on the screen.&lt;ref name="guardian announce"/&gt; The software includes multiple game-modes: Robot, VS, Challenge, Robo-Studio, and the Hangar. Robot mode gives the player the ability to control the giant robot as it attacks targets across a cityscape, to control the robot as it flies over a city, and to transform in a tank. The two-player VS mode allows players to fight with their giant robots, though both players need a separate Robot Toy-Con for this mode.&lt;ref name="labo software"/&gt; In Challenge Mode, the player can complete missions to unlock special abilities that can be used in the game's other modes. The Robo-Studio mode allows the player to insert the Console into the Toy-Con and play sound effects based on the player's movement, while the Hanger allows the player to customize the color and appearance of their virtual robot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/15/17016316/nintendo-labo-variety-kit-robot-kit-videos|title=Nintendo Labo Variety Kit and Robot Kit detailed in new videos|last=Grant|first=Christopher|date=February 15, 2018|website=Polygon|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists noted similarities between this Kit and ''Project Giant Robot'', a software title for the [[Wii U]] that had players use the motion sensing of the [[Wii U GamePad]] to control a robot and rampage through a city. ''Project Giant Robot'' was teased during [[E3 2014]] and believed to be tied to ''[[Star Fox Zero]]'', but was ultimately cancelled by Nintendo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/that-nintendo-labo-robot-game-looks-awfully-familiar-1822176412 | title = That Nintendo Labo Robot Game Looks Awfully Familiar | first = Chris | last = Kohler | date = January 17, 2018 | accessdate = January 17, 2018 | work = [[Kotaku]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180118013109/https://kotaku.com/that-nintendo-labo-robot-game-looks-awfully-familiar-1822176412 | archivedate = January 18, 2018 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/nintendos-labo-playset-slaps-the-switch-into-build-your-own-cardboard-toys/ | title = Nintendo’s Labo playset slaps the Switch into build-your-own cardboard toys | first = Sam | last = Mackovech | date = January 17, 2018 | accessdate = January 17, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180117223346/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/nintendos-labo-playset-slaps-the-switch-into-build-your-own-cardboard-toys/ | archivedate = January 17, 2018 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Labo developers stated in an interview that the original prototype was a ground-based tank with interactive floor pedals, but risked being crushed by the user and did not utilize the potential of the Joy-Con's gyro sensor; to solve these issues, the prototype was modified to be worn as a "Carry-Con" on the user's back.&lt;ref name="devinterview cardboard" /&gt;

===Vehicle Kit===
Nintendo announced its first post-release Labo Kit in July 2018, which was released worldwide on September 14, 2018. The Vehicle Kit includes the cardboard parts to make three steering consoles, one for a car, one for a plane, and one for a submarine, each with a slot for a "key" that is built around a Toy-Con. The associated game allows players to control cars, planes, and submarines in game, switching between these modes by moving their Toy-Con key between units, and supports co-operative play with a second person using another Toy-Con.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/26/17620442/nintendo-labo-vehicle-kit-release-date-switch | title=  New Nintendo Labo kit is all about vehicles | first = Michael | last = McWhertor | date = July 26, 2018 | accessdate = July 26, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The kit also includes cutouts for a pedal Toy-Con to power each of the vehicles, two key Toy-Cons, a spray can Toy-Con, and a stand for the console to sit atop the car Toy-Con. Included with the spray can Toy-Con are several "extra parts" made to aid in the Paint Studio, the mode made for it.

===Interactions with other games===
A free update to ''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]'' in June 2018 allowed players to use the motorbike Toy-Con, from the Variety Kit, to control their racer in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/26/nintendo-labo-now-compatible-with-mario-kart-8-deluxe | title = Nintendo Labo Now Compatible With Mario Kart 8 Deluxe | first=  Adam | last = Bankhurst | date = June 25, 2018 | accessdate = June 25, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, Nintendo announced that the car steering wheel Toy-Con from the upcoming Vehicle Kit will also be compatible with ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe''.&lt;ref name="NL cites Vehicle support for MK8D"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/08/the_nintendo_labo_vehicle_kit_will_work_with_mario_kart_8_deluxe_on_switch |date=August 24, 2018 |accessdate=August 31, 2018 |last=Craddock |first=Ryan |website=[[Nintendo Life]] |title=The Nintendo Labo Vehicle Kit Will Work With Mario Kart 8 Deluxe On Switch}}&lt;/ref&gt; After unveiling a tech demo in April 2018,&lt;ref name="NL cites Deemo demo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/04/video_rayark_shows_off_deemo_tech_demo_with_nintendo_labo_piano_support |date=April 26, 2018 |accessdate=August 31, 2018 |last=Craddock |first=Ryan |website=[[Nintendo Life]] |title=Video: Rayark Shows Off Deemo Tech Demo With Nintendo Labo Piano Support}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rayark Games announced their title ''[[Deemo]]'' will gain limited support for the piano Toy-Con, from the Variety Kit, in October 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.siliconera.com/2018/08/26/deemo-to-receive-nintendo-labo-toy-con-piano-support-in-october/ | title = Deemo To Receive Nintendo Labo Toy-Con Piano Support In October | first =Alistair | last =Wong | date = August 26, 2018 | accessdate = August 26, 2018 | work = [[Siliconera]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; marking as the first third-party title to support Nintendo Labo.&lt;ref name="NL cites Deemo support"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/08/third_party_dev_behind_deemo_jumps_on_nintendo_labo_cardboard_wagon |date=August 25, 2018 |accessdate=August 31, 2018 |last=Doolan |first=Liam |website=[[Nintendo Life]] |title=Third Party Dev Behind Deemo Jumps On Nintendo Labo Cardboard Wagon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
On the day after its announcement in January 2018, Nintendo's stock price jumped around 2.4%, representing about {{USD|1.4 billion}} to their value. Analysis suggested that Labo was the type of unorthodox product that only Nintendo could develop and market, showing a further return to their more financially-successful period about a decade prior, leading to the rising stock price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ft.com/content/acaf28d6-fc50-11e7-a492-2c9be7f3120a | title = Nintendo adds almost $1.4bn in value — thanks to cardboard | first = Leo | last = Lewis | date = January 18, 2018 | accessdate = January 18, 2018 | work = [[Financial Times]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180119034248/https://www.ft.com/content/acaf28d6-fc50-11e7-a492-2c9be7f3120a | archivedate = January 19, 2018 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most '''organisms involved in [[water purification]]''' originate from the waste, [[wastewater]] or water stream itself or arrive as resting spore of some form from the atmosphere. In a very few cases, mostly associated with [[constructed wetlands]], specific organisms are planted to maximise the efficiency of the process.

==Role of biota==
[[Biota (ecology)|Biota]] are an essential component of most [[sewage treatment]] processes and many [[water purification]] systems. Most of the organisms involved are derived from the waste, [[wastewater]] or water stream itself or from the atmosphere or soil water. However some  processes, especially those involved in removing very low concentrations of contaminants, may use engineered eco-systems created by the introduction of specific plants and sometimes animals.  Some full scale sewage treatment plants also use [[constructed wetlands]] to provide treatment

==Pollutants in wastewater==

===Pathogens===
[[Parasite]]s, [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es may be injurious to the health of people or livestock ingesting the [[Water pollution|polluted water]].  These pathogens may have originated from [[sewage]] or from domestic or wild bird or mammal [[feces]].  Pathogens may be killed by ingestion by larger organisms, oxidation, infection by [[phage]]s or irradiation by [[ultraviolet]] sunlight unless that sunlight is blocked by plants or suspended solids.&lt;ref&gt;Fair, Geyer &amp; Okun pp.31-3&amp;31-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspended solids===
Particles of soil or organic matter may be suspended in the water.  Such materials may give the water a cloudy or [[turbidity|turbid]] appearance.  The anoxic decomposition of some organic materials may give rise to obnoxious or unpleasant smells as sulphur containing compounds are released.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer pp.29&amp;35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrients===
Compounds containing [[nitrogen]], [[potassium]] or [[phosphorus]] may encourage growth of aquatic plants and thus increase the available energy in the local food-web. this can lead to increased concentrations of suspended organic material. In some cases specific micro-nutrients may be required to allow the available nutrients to be fully utilised by living organisms. In other cases, the presence of specific chemical species may produce toxic effects limiting growth and abundance of living matter.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy pp.256-258&amp;492&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metals===
Many dissolved or suspended metal salts exert harmful effects in the environment sometimes at very low concentrations. Some aquatic plants are able to remove very low metal concentrations, with the metals ending up bound to clay or other mineral particles.

==Organisms==
[[Saprophytic]] bacteria and [[fungi]] can convert organic matter into living cell mass, carbon dioxide, water and a range of metabolic by-products.  These saprophytic organisms may then be predated upon by [[protozoa]], [[rotifers]] and, in cleaner waters, [[Bryozoa]] which consume suspended organic particles including viruses and pathogenic bacteria.  Clarity of the water may begin to improve as the [[protozoa]] are subsequently consumed by [[rotifer]]s and [[cladocera]].&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy pp.380&amp;381&lt;/ref&gt;  Purifying bacteria, protozoa, and rotifers must either be mixed throughout the water or have the water circulated past them to be effective.  Sewage treatment plants mix these organisms as [[activated sludge]] or circulate water past organisms living on [[trickling filter]]s or [[rotating biological contactor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fair, Geyer &amp; Okun pp.32-12,32-31&amp;34-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquatic vegetation may provide similar surface habitat for purifying bacteria, protozoa, and rotifers in a pond or marsh setting; although water circulation is often less effective.  Plants and algae have the additional advantage of removing nutrients from the water; but some of those nutrients will be returned to the water when the plants die unless the plants are removed from the water.  Because of the complex chemistry of [[Phosphorus]] much of this element is in an unavailable form unless decomposition creates anoxic conditions which render the phosphorus available for re-uptake. Plants also provide [[shade (shadow)|shade]], a refuge for [[fish]], and [[oxygen]] for [[aerobic bacteria]]. In addition, [[fish]] can limit [[Pest (organism)|pests]] such as [[mosquitoes]].  Fish and waterfowl feces return waste to the water, and their feeding habits may increase [[turbidity]].  [[Cyanobacteria]] have the disadvantageous ability to [[nitrogen fixation|add nutrients from the air]] to the water being purified and to generate toxins in some cases.

The choice of [[organism]] depends on the local [[climate]] different [[species]] and other factors. Indigenous species usually tend to be better adapted to the local environment.

===Macrophytes===
[[Image:Irispseudacorus waterpurification.jpg|thumb|right|A water-purifying plant (''Iris pseudacorus'') in growth after winter (leaves die at that time of year)]]
The choice of plants in engineered wet-lands or managed lagoons is dependent on the purification requirements of the system and this may involve plantings of varying plant species at a range of depths to achieve the  required goal.

Plants purify water by consuming excess [[nutrients]] and by providing surfaces upon which a wide range of other purifying organisms can live. They also are effective oxygenators in sunlight. They also have the ability to translocate chemicals between their submerged foliage and their root systems and this is of significance in engineered wet-lands designed to de-toxify waste waters. Plants that have been used in temperate climates include ''[[Nymphaea|Nymphea alba]]'',''[[Phragmites australis]]'', ''[[Sparganium|Sparganium erectum]]'', ''[[Iris pseudacorus]]'', ''[[Schoenoplectus|Schoenoplectus lacustris]]'' and ''[[Carex acutiformis]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Where oxygenation is a critical requirement  ''[[Stratiotes|Stratiotes aloides]]'',  ''[[Hydrocharis|Hydrocharis morsus-ranae]]'', ''[[Acorus calamus]]'', ''[[Myriophyllum]]'' species and ''[[Elodea]]'' have been used.
''[[Hydrocharis|Hydrocharis morsus-ranae]]'' and ''[[Nuphar |Nuphar lutea]]'' have been used where shade and cover are required

===Fish===
Fish are frequently the top level predators in a managed treatment eco-system and in some case may simply be a mono-culture of herbivorous species. Management of multi-species fisheries requires careful management and may involve a range of fish species including bottom-feeders and predatory species to limit population growth of the herbivorous fish

===Rotifers===
[[Rotifer]]s are microscopic complex organisms and are filter feeders removing fine particulate matter from water. They occur naturally in aerobic lagoons, activated sludge processes, in trickling filters and in final settlement tanks and are a significant factor in removing suspended bacterial cells and algae from the water column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23552245|title=The use of rotifers for limiting filamentous bacteria Type 021N a bacteria causing activated sludge bulking.| doi=10.2166/wst.2013.028|volume=67|year=2013|journal=Water Sci Technol|pages=1557–63|author=Kocerba-Soroka W, Fiałkowska E, Pajdak-Stós A, Klimek B, Kowalska E, Drzewicki A, Salvadó H, Fyda J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projektor.uj.edu.pl/en/sp/naturescope/rotifers|title=Rotifers – the allies from the invisible world|publisher=Projektor Jagielloński|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annelids===
[[Annelid]] worms are essential to the effective operation of trickling filters &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=
Earthworms and Trickling Filters|publisher= Water Environment Federation|jstor=25042220|author1=Hartenstein R|author2=Kaplan D L|author3= Neuhauser E F |volume=56, No. 3, Part I|date = March 1984|pages= 294–298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; helping to remove excess bio-mass and enhancing natural sloughing of the bio-film. Supernumerary worms are very commonly found in the drainage troughs around trickling filters and in the final settlement sludge. Annelids also play a key role in lagoon treatment systems and in the effective working or engineered wet-lands. In this environment worms are a principal force in mixing in the upper few centimetres of the sediment layer exposing organic material to both oxidative and anoxic environments aiding the complete breakdown of most organics. They are also a key ingredient in the food-chain transferring energy upwards to fish and aquatic birds.

===Protozoa===
The range of protozoan species found is very wide but may include species of the following genera:
* [[Amoeba (genus)|Amoeba]]&lt;ref name="fgo"&gt;Fair, Geyer &amp; Okun p.34-8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arcella]]&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Blepharisma]]&lt;ref name="ham"&gt;Hammer pp.54&amp;61&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Didinium]]&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Euglena]]&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Hypotrich]]&lt;ref name="ham"/&gt;
* [[Paramecium]]&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Suctoria]]&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy p.381&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stylonychia]]&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Vorticella]]&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;

===Insects===
* [[Chironomidae]] bloodworm larva&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Podura aquatica]] water springtail&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Psychodidae]] drain fly or filter fly larva&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;

'''Peek Freans''' is the name of a former [[biscuit]] making company based in [[Bermondsey]], [[London]], which is now a global brand of biscuits and related confectionery owned by various food businesses. Owned but not marketed in the UK and Europe by [[United Biscuits]], in the United States and Canada the brand is owned by [[Mondelēz International]], whilst in [[Pakistan]] the brand is owned by [[English Biscuit Manufacturers]].

==Background==
James Peek (1800&amp;ndash;1879) was one of three brothers born in [[Kingsbridge|Dodbrooke, Devon]], to a well-off family.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; In 1821 the three brothers founded a [[tea]] importation company, established as Peek Brothers and Co., in the [[East End of London]].&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; By the 1840s, the company was importing £5M of tea per annum.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

In 1824, Peek married Elizabeth Masters (1799&amp;ndash;1867). The couple had eight children.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; By 1857, two of his late-teenage sons had announced that they were not going to join the family tea import business. Peek wanted them in a complementary trade and proposed that they start a biscuit business. After founding the business, the two sons quickly decided on a different course (one died in his early 20s; the other emigrated to North America). As a consequence Peek needed someone to run the biscuit business. One of his nieces, Hannah Peek, had recently married George Hender Frean, a [[miller]] and [[ship biscuit]] maker in Devon, so Peek wrote to Frean asking him to manage the new biscuit business.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

==History==
The partners registered their business in 1857 as Peek, Frean &amp; Co. Ltd, based in a disused [[sugar refinery]] on Mill Street in Dockhead, South East 
London,&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; in the west of [[Bermondsey]].&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; With a quickly expanding business, in 1860 Peek engaged his friend James Carr, the apprenticed son of the [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]-based Scottish milling and biscuit making family, [[Carr's]].&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

From 1861, the company started exporting biscuits to [[Australia]],&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; but outgrew their premises from 1870 after agreeing to fulfil an order from the [[French Army]] for {{convert|460|LT}} of biscuits for the ration packs supplied to soldiers fighting the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; After hostilities ended, the French Government ordered a further {{convert|16000|LT}}/11 million sweet Pearl biscuits in celebration of the end of the [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)|Siege of Paris]], and further flour supplies for Paris in 1871 and 1872, with financing undertaken by their bankers the [[Rothschild banking family of France|Rothschilds]].&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; The consequential consumer demands of emigrating French expatriate soldiers, allowed the company to start exporting directly to [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] from the mid-1870s.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

===Biscuit Town===
In 1865 Peek agreed with Carr that the business needed bigger premises. In exchange for a stake in the business, Carr gave the company {{convert|10|acre}} of [[market garden]]s he had recently bought on Clements Road and Drummond Road, Bermondsey.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; Commissioning a new integrated factory, its resultant scale and sweet-emanating smell resulted in Bermondsey gaining the nickname "Biscuit Town".&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shadyoldlady.com/location.php?loc=764|title= Peek Frean's Biscuit Factory in Bermondsey, London|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4213787.stm |title=Biscuit Factory Makes 'Comeback' |date=8 February 2005 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of the factory coincided in 1866 with James Peek stepping down from the business, installing his son-in-law Thomas Stone in his place.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; 

On 23 April 1873 the old Dockhead factory burnt down in a spectacular fire,&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; which brought the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]] out on a [[London Fire Brigade]] horse-drawn water pump to view the resulting explosions.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

James Peek died aged 79 at his home in Watcome near [[Torquay]], Devon.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; After George Frean's son James Frean retired in 1887, his family had nothing more to do with running the business. Peek's nephew Francis Hedley Peek became the first [[chairman]] of the now publicly listed company in 1901, but on his death in 1904 again the Peek family had nothing more to do with managing the business. James Carr's family remained actively associated with the business for several more generations.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

In 1906, the Peek, Frean and Co. factory in Bermondsey was the subject of one of the earliest [[documentary film]]s shot by Cricks and Sharp.&lt;ref name="Film"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/711535/index.html | title=A Visit to Peek Frean and Co.'s Biscuit Works | publisher=Cricks and Sharp | year=1906 | accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in part to celebrate an expansion of the company's cake business, which later made the [[wedding cake]]s for both [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and the [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer]]. In 1949, when James Carr's relative Rupert Carr established a new biscuit factory in [[York]], he named the new street on which it stood "Bermondsey Road".&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

In 1924, the company established their first factory outside the UK, in [[Dum Dum]], [[India]].&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; In 1949 they establishment their first bakery in [[Canada]], located on Bermondsey Road in [[East York, Ontario]], which still today produces Peek Freans branded products..

After 126 years, the London factory was closed by then owner BSN on Wednesday 26 May 1989.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; Left derelict for a long period, the former premises were eventually redeveloped into what today is called the Tower Bridge Business Complex.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{cite book|title=London's Industrial Heritage|author=Geoff Marshall|publisher=The History Press|date=1 May 2013|ISBN=9780752487281}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011, a tinned [[Christmas pudding]] was discovered at the back of a kitchen cupboard in [[Poole, Dorset]]. Donated to the museum at [[Portsmouth Historic Dockyard]], it was a "Peek, Frean &amp; Co's Teetotal Plum Pudding—London, High Class Ingredients Only" from the 1900s. It was one of a thousand puddings sent on behalf of [[Agnes Weston|Agnes "Aggie" Weston]], superintendent of the Royal Naval Temperance Society – hence its recipe being [[teetotal]]),{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} (alcohol-free) – to British troops during the [[Boer War]].

===Innovation===
From the outset of its establishment, the company produced what were then the established form of biscuits in the [[Commonwealth]] countries, a hard, square, pin-pricked (known as "docker-holes", introduced by the baker to stop the biscuit expanding like a bread) dry style, suitable for storage on ships in passage due to its longevity.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; However, Carr brought his knowledge of both the Scottish cake-like tradition (i.e.: shortbread), and experience during his apprenticeship of Dutch sweet and soft [[cookie]]s. With James Peek still viewing the business as a complementary and co-marketing opportunity to the families tea company, they began introducing sweetened product lines:&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;
*1861: sweet fruit-filled biscuit, the [[Garibaldi biscuit|Garibaldi]], named after Italian general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] who toured the UK in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/7944512/The-Kitchen-Thinker-Garibaldi-biscuits.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*1865: a soft biscuit, the "Pearl". This was the first soft-biscuit introduced by a UK-based manufacturer
*1875: the "Marie", an Anglicised version of the [[Maria (biscuit)|Galletas Marías]]
*1899: the first chocolate covered sweet [[digestive biscuit]], marketed as the "Chocolate Table"
*1902: "Pat-a-Cake" shortbread
*1909: the "Golden Puff"
*1910: a biscuit with crème filling, launched as the "Creola", now known as the [[Bourbon biscuit]]
*1912: the "Shortcake"

Like many good employers of the Victorian age, the company developed an enlightened matriarch-like approach, giving many innovative benefits to its employees.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; At its Biscuit Town factory, much like a mini-town, as well as having: an on-site bank, post office and fire station; employees and their families had free-to-use access to on-site medical, dental and optical services.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; The original contracted hours were 68 across a Monday-Saturday double-shift pattern, but these were reduced from 1868 without a reduction in pay, noted as highly beneficial by [[Henry Mayhew]].&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; The directors wanted to ensure that the workers didn't indulge in "virtuous pursuits",{{vague|date=April 2018}}{{what?|date=April 2018}} and so formed the first of the company paid-for societies, included: a cricket club (1868); musical society (1907); and athletic and dramatic societies (both 1908).&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; Post-[[World War I]], the company set up a tribunal, through which workers could freely express and debate their concerns. This resulted in the company giving its employees a pension plan, plus a week's paid holiday per year.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

===Associated Biscuit Manufacturers===
In 1921, Peek Frean entered into an amalgamation agreement with rival biscuit firm [[Huntley and Palmers]], resulting in the creation of a holding company, Associated Biscuit Manufacturers Ltd (ABM).&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; However, both biscuit firms retained their own brands and premises. [[Jacob's]] joined the conglomerate from 1961. [[English Biscuit Manufacturers]] (EBM) was established in [[Pakistan]] as a local joint-venture production company from 1965, which still owns the various brand rights in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebm.com.pk/about-ebm.aspx English Biscuit Manufacturers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810085009/http://www.ebm.com.pk/about-ebm.aspx |date=2010-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of its life, the firm's brand name changed from Peek, Frean and Co. to Peek Frean (in the early twentieth century) and then to Peek Freans (by the 1970s, the name having been used in the possessive case on products for many years).

==Present==
The company was broken apart from 1982, after [[Nabisco]] bought ABM. In 1985, Nabisco was acquired by the foods division of [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]], resulting in the creation of conglomerate [[RJR Nabisco]]. After RJR Nabisco was bought in a [[leveraged buyout]] by [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]], to pay down the resultant debt pile, various assets were sold off. This included dividing the former Peek Freans company; the North America division was sold to [[Kraft Foods]], the European mainly-UK division was sold to the European food conglomerate BSN (now known as [[Groupe Danone]]), and many of the international subsidiaries were sold off locally to in-country investors, e.g. EBM. As part of its cost cutting, BSN ended use and marketing of the brand in the UK, which allowed it to shut the factory in Bermondsey. In September 2004 [[United Biscuits]] bought what was by then known as the [[Jacob's|Jacob's Biscuit Group]] for £240M from Groupe Danone. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040724/ai_n12801313| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227175451/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040724/ai_n12801313| dead-url=yes| archive-date=27 December 2007|publisher = [[The Independent]] |date = 24 July 2004 |title = Danone sells its UK biscuits to United |accessdate = 12 April 2007 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Peek Frean trademark was acquired by the great-great-great-grandson of Francis Peek, the first Chairman of Peek Frean and the son of James Peek.{{CN|date=April 2018}}

Between them they produced two experimental prototypes, the PKZ-1 and PKZ-2, intended to replace the dangerous [[hydrogen]]-filled [[observation balloon]]s then in use. As such, these craft were tethered on long cables and were not intended to fly freely. After the war other engineers, notably [[Oszkár Asboth|Oszkár von Asboth]], further developed the design.&lt;ref name="Grosz"&gt;Grosz (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1916, the aviator Oberstlt István Petróczy proposed an electrically driven rotorcraft to replace the dangerously flammable observation balloon. His original concept was for the electric motor to be supplied by a dynamo driven by an internal combustion engine.&lt;ref name="Grosz" /&gt;

Austro-Daimler were at that time developing a lightweight electric motor for aircraft use, but would take several years to develop one able to handle the electrical power required. A major problem was in providing high-quality insulation for the motor windings, which could get very hot in use.&lt;ref name="Grosz" /&gt;

Meanwhile, tests on the large propellers then available showed them to be too inefficient and so a research programme into efficient large propellers, for use as rotors, was begun at Fischamend airfield. Dr. [[Theodore von Kármán]] was the director of the research group at Fischamend and Ensign Vilém Žurovec was an engineer there.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar, N. and Kennedy, F.; ''Military helicopters of the world: military rotary-wing aircraft since 1917'', Arms and Armour, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Model tests showed that proposed designs with a single tether were unstable. Initially four tethers were used to provide stability, but this was later reduced to three.&lt;ref name="Grosz" /&gt;

By 1917 the technology appeared ready and two rotary-wing aircraft, the PKZ-1 and PKZ-2, were built under separate projects. Both types hovered briefly while tethered, though even with the tethers they were barely controllable and required skilful handling of the tethers. At the time these were referred to as ''schraubenfesselflieger'' or SFF (propeller-driven captive aircraft). The PKZ designations were applied later in a postwar article by Karman.&lt;ref name="Grosz" /&gt;

A third design, for a small unmanned version powered by a single Gnome rotary piston engine, was constructed in 1918. It was intended to carry meteorological (weather) instruments or radio antennas aloft, but it is not known whether it ever flew.&lt;ref name="Grosz" /&gt;

==PKZ-1==
The PKZ-1 was designed by Karman and Žurovec, and built by MAG in [[Budapest]] under Karman's direction.&lt;ref name="Grosz" /&gt; It had four radiating arms with a 3.9 m four-bladed rotor or propeller on top of each, geared in pairs such that each pair spun in the opposite direction. The rotors were driven from a single [[Austro-Daimler]] electric motor located centrally, beneath the observer's cockpit. The 195&amp;nbsp;kg motor produced {{convert|190|hp|kW|order=flip}} at 6,000 rpm, limited by the heat resistance of the insulation around the windings – in other respects it was capable of producing {{convert|250|hp|kW|order=flip|abbr=on}}. to A ground-based generator fed [[direct current]] (DC) through the tethering cables to the motor. Landing gear comprised four inflated rubber-fabric cushions, one under the end of each arm.&lt;ref name="Grosz" /&gt;

The finished craft was taken to Fischamend for flight testing. In a short series of four test flights in March 1918 the craft was able to lift three men. The wiring insulation in the motor burned out on the fourth flight and was not repaired.&lt;ref name="Grosz" /&gt;

==PKZ-2==
[[File:PKZ-2helikopter.gif|thumb|The PKZ-2 with a single observer on board]]
The PKZ-2 was developed by Žurovec in parallel with the PKZ-1, but wholly independently. Zurovec acknowledged the support only of Petróczy, although later reports have mistakenly attributed the entire design to Kármán. The aircraft was built by Dr Liptak &amp; Co AG under Žurovek's direction. It had three radiating arms, each housing a rotary piston engine. These engines were coupled together to drive a central pair of co-axial, contra-rotating two-bladed wooden propellers or rotors, of 6&amp;nbsp;m diameter, mounted above the airframe. A round cockpit for the aircrew was fixed centrally, on top of the rotor mast. Landing gear again comprised rubber-fabric cushions, one large central one and three smaller ones at the end of each arm.&lt;ref name="Grosz" /&gt;

The PKZ-2 began flight trials on 2 April 1918. Initially fitted with three Gnome rotary engines of {{convert|100|hp|kW|order=flip|abbr=on}}, these were found insufficient to maintain safety at any altitude and were replaced by le Rhone rotary engines of {{convert|120|hp|kW|order=flip|abbr=on}}. In this form the PKZ-2 could rise to a height of over 50&amp;nbsp;m and hover for up to half an hour, although it was unstable and remained tethered on long cables. To maintain stability and control, the tethers had to remain in tension, as if the engines faltered the tethers could slacken and control would be lost.&lt;ref name="Grosz" /&gt;

On 10 June the aircraft was demonstrated to Air Service officials. The le Rhone engines were not reliable and Žurovec had misgivings about the demonstration. These turned out to be justified when the engines faltered. The tether handlers panicked and this resulted in a crash-landing, damaging the craft and breaking the rotors.&lt;ref name="Grosz" /&gt;
After the war the Italians confiscated the aircraft and took it back to Italy.&lt;ref name="Grosz" /&gt;

==Von Asboth==
{{Main|Oszkár Asboth}}
[[File:Vígh Mihály bemutató repülése az AH 4-gyel az angol Ministry bizottsága előtt.jpg|thumb|The AH-4 in flight]]
[[Oszkár Asboth|Oszkár von Asboth]] was one of the researchers at Fischamend. In 1917 he commissioned Ufag to make a full-scale prototype to his own design, but it was destroyed in a fire before completion. After the war he went on to build and fly several more helicopters. One was constructed in 1920 but later destroyed on the order of the [[Allied Control Commission]]. Subsequent examples based on the PKZ-2 design were designated AH-1 to AH-4 and made over 150 successful flights between 1928 and 1930.&lt;ref name="Grosz" /&gt; Von Asboth later set up companies in Britain and France to promote his twin-rotor designs, and at least one machine was built by the French company.{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=appears not widely known today}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1151">A '''pilot direction indicator''', or '''PDI''', is an aircraft instrument used by [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardiers]] to indicate heading changes to the pilot in order to direct them to the proper location to drop [[bomb]]s. The PDI is used in aircraft where the pilot and bombardier are physically separated and cannot easily see each other.

PDI's typically consist of a dial that is installed in the pilot's instrument set on the main console, with an arrow pointer than can be moved to indicate how far and in what direction to correct the heading. The bombardier typically has a switch to move the pointer to the right or left, and a repeater dial so he can see the setting.

The [[Norden bombsight]] was originally designed with the idea of automatically directing a PDI and thereby simplifying the bombardier's task.

A '''production packer'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=W.T Bell, L.E.Buzarde, C.L.DePriester and R.L. Kastor|title=PRODUCTION OPERATIONS COURSE 1 - WELL COMPLETIONS|year=1972|publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers AIME|location=Dallas Texas 75206}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a standard component of the completion hardware of [[Oil well|oil or gas wells]] used to provide a seal between the outside of the [[production tubing]] and the inside of the casing, liner, or wellbore wall.

Based on their primary use, packers can be divided into two main categories: production packers and service packers. Production packers are those that remain in the well during well production. Service packers are used temporarily during well service activities such as cement squeezing, acidizing, fracturing and well testing.

It is usually run in close to the bottom end of the production tubing and set at a point above the top [[Perforation (oil well)|perforations]] or sand screens.  In wells with multiple [[Oil reservoir|reservoir]] zones, packers are used to isolate the perforations for each zone. In these situations, a [[sliding sleeve]] would be used to select which zone to produce. Packers may also be used to protect the casing from pressure and produced fluids, isolate sections of corroded casing, casing leaks or squeezed perforations, and isolate or temporarily abandon producing zones. In water-flooding developments in which water is injected into the reservoir, packers are used in injection wells to isolate the zones into which the water must be injected.

There are occasions in which running a packer may not be desirable. For example, high volume wells that are produced both up the tubing and annulus will not include a packer. Rod pumped wells are not normally run with packers because the associated gas is produced up the annulus. In general, well completions may not incorporate a packer when the annular space is used as a production conduit.

A production packer is designed to grip and seal against the [[Casing (oil well)|casing]] ID. Gripping is accomplished with metal wedges called "slips." These components have sharpened, [[Carburization|carburized]] teeth that dig into the metal of the casing. Sealing is accomplished with large, cylindrical rubber elements. In situations where the sealed pressure is very high (above 5,000 psi), metal rings are used on either side of the elements to prevent the rubber from extruding.

A packer is run in the casing on production tubing or [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]]. Once the desired depth is reached, the slips and element must be expanded out to contact the casing. Axial loads are applied to push the slips up a ramp and to compress the element, causing it to expand outward. The axial loads are applied either hydraulically, mechanically, or with a slow burning chemical charge.

Most packers are "permanent" and require milling in order to remove them from the casing. The main advantages of permanent packers are lower cost and greater sealing and gripping capabilities.

In situations where a packer must be easily removed from the well, such as secondary recoveries, re-completions, or to change out the production tubing, a retrievable packer must be used. To unset the tool, either a metal ring is sheared or a sleeve is shifted to disengage connecting components. Retrievable packers have a more complicated design and generally lower sealing and gripping capabilities, but after removal and subsequent servicing, they can be reused.

==Applications==
* Casing protection
* Separation of multiple zones
* Isolation packers
* Elimination of surging and heading
* Sub-surface safety control
* Artificial/gas lift

There are three types of packers: mechanical and hydraulic set and permanent. All packers fall into one or a combination of these.

'''Mechanical set packers''' are set by some form of tubing movement, usually a rotation or upward /downward motion.

Others can be weight set—the tubing weight can be used to compress and expand the sealing element. By a simple up string pull the packer is released. It is used best in shallow low pressure wells that are straight. It is not designed to withstand pressure differences unless a hydraulic hold down is incorporated.

'''Tension-set packers''' are set by pulling a tension on the tubing, slacking off releases the packer. Good for shallow wells with moderate pressure differences.  The lower pressure helps to increase the setting force on the packer. Used in a stimulation well.

'''Rotation-set packer''' – Tubing rotation is used to set the packer to mechanically lock it in; a left-hand turn engages and a right-hand turn retrieves it.

'''Hydraulic-set packers''' use fluid pressure to drive the cone behind the slips. Once set they remain set by the use of either entrapped pressure or a mechanical lock. They are released by picking up the tubing. They are good for used in deviated or crooked holes where tubing movement is restricted or unwanted. The tubing can be hung in neutral tension.

'''Inflatable packers'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giacomel|first=A.|author2=Rowe, C. |title=Inflatable Packer Fundamentals|journal=Proceedings of International Drill '92 Conference Perth Western Australia|date=Oct 1992|url=http://www.inflatable-packers.com/images/documents/drill92_inflate_basics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; - use fluid pressure to inflate a long cylindrical tube of reinforced rubber to set the packer. Frequently used for open hole testing in exploration wells and for cement assurance in production wells. Also used in wells where the packer must pass through a restriction and then set at a much larger diameter in casing or open holes. Many variations for specific applications are available including those capable of withstanding high pressure differentials.

'''Permanent packers''' are run and set on an electric wireline, drill pipe or tubing. Opposed slips are positioned to lock it in compression. Once set this packer is resistant to motion for either direction. Wireline uses an electric current to detonate an explosive charge to set the packer. A release stud then frees the assembly form the packer. Tubing can be used by applying rotation or a pull or a combination of both. They are good in wells that have high pressure differentials or large tubing load variations and can be set precisely. They can be set the deepest.

'''Cement packers''' – In this case the tubing is cemented in place inside the casing or open hole. This type of packer is cheap.

==Factors affecting packers==
Temperature and pressure can affect how the tubing and the packer behave as this could cause changes in the packer and tubing expansion rates. If the packer allows free motion then the tubing can elongate or shorten. If not the tensile and compressive forces can develop within.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/view/74831 Dorohov M., Kostryba I, Biletskyi V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5065">'''Proto-industrialization''' (also spelled '''proto-industrialisation''') was a possible phase in the development of modern industrial economies that preceded, and created conditions for, the establishment of fully industrial societies. Proto-industrialisation generally refers to the phase before industrialisation. Proto-industrialization was marked by the increasing involvement of agrarian families in market-oriented craft production, mainly through the [[putting-out system]] organized by [[merchant capitalists]]. It was an effective method of production which was controlled by merchants and had links to developing European consumerism. However, the phase was not observed across Europe, and nor did it always smoothly transition into the Industrial Revolution proper.

The term was coined by F. F. Mendels in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendels|first=Frank. F.|title=Proto-industrialization: The First Phase of the Industrialization Process|journal=Economic History Review|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;
though a UNESCO colloquium on the 10th anniversary of the deaths of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Teilhard de Chardin]] and published in 1971 discusses "the basis for proto-industrialization".&lt;ref&gt;

The applicability of proto-industrialization in Europe has since been challenged. M.J. Daunton, for example, argues that proto-industrialisation "excludes too much" to fully explain the expansion of industry: not only do proponents of proto-industrialisation ignore the vital town-based industries in pre-industrial economies, but also ignores "rural and urban industry based upon non-domestic organisation", referring to how mines, mills, forges and furnaces fit into the agrarian economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daunton|first1=Martin|title=Progress and Poverty: An Economic and Social History of Britain 1700-1850|date=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-19-822281-5|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially using surplus labor available during slow periods of the agricultural seasons, proto-industrialization led to specialization - not only in industrial production but also in commercial agricultural production. This allowed reciprocal trade favored by regional [[economies of scale]]. It resulted in accumulation of capital and in the acquisition of entrepreneurial skills by merchant capitalists, which facilitated the development of large-scale, and capital-intensive production methods in the full industrialization phase that followed.

Proto-industrialization sparked social changes in traditional agrarian societies that would become more marked during full industrialization, such as greater independence of women and children, who gained a means of income separate from the family [[subsistence farm]]. During this phase of [[industrialisation]], [[machines]] were not used. They were not even invented at that time. People could only use their hands or any hand-made material to produce required goods.{{citation needed|date=July 2016|reason=Odd claim, because mills used water and wind power in the middle ages, later water power was for example used to drive bellows in early blast furnaces etc before the industrial revolution proper started}}

The term proto-industrialization has also been used in reference to [[Mughal India]] during the 17th–18th centuries, when the [[Indian subcontinent]] experienced a growth in manufacturing industries and its economy had similar conditions to 18th-century [[Western Europe]] prior to the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="voss"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ashgate Companion to the History of Textile Workers, 1650-2000|author=Lex Heerma van Voss, Els Hiemstra-Kuperus, Elise van Nederveen Meerkerk|chapter=The Long Globalization and Textile Producers in India|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2010|page=255|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f95ljbhfjxIC&amp;pg=PA255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychological warfare''' ('''PSYWAR'''), or the basic aspects of modern '''psychological operations''' ('''PSYOP'''), have been known by many other names or terms, including [[Psychological Operations (United States)|MISO]], Psy Ops, [[political warfare]], "Hearts and Minds", and [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo9/no1/05-clow-eng.asp |title=Forces.gc.ca |publisher=Journal.forces.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used "to denote any action which is practiced mainly by psychological methods with the aim of evoking a planned psychological reaction in other people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Szunyogh |first=Béla |date=1955 |title=Psychological warfare; an introduction to ideological propaganda and the techniques of psychological warfare |url= http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?sid=11483538-24de-49b9-a526-8708fa45e67e%40sessioGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=edshtl&amp;AN=mdp.39015002229154 |location=United States |publisher=William-Frederick Press |page=13 |accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various techniques are used, and are aimed at influencing a target audience's [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]] system, [[belief]] system, [[emotion]]s, [[Base motive|motives]], [[reasoning]], or [[behavior]].

In ''[[Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes]]'', [[Jacques Ellul]] discusses psychological warfare as a common peace policy practice between nations as a form of indirect aggression. This type of propaganda drains the public opinion of an opposing regime by stripping away its power on public opinion. This form of aggression is hard to defend against because no international court of justice is capable of protecting against psychological aggression since it cannot be legally adjudicated. "Here the propagandists is [sic] dealing with a foreign adversary whose morale he seeks to destroy by psychological means so that the opponent begins to doubt the validity of his beliefs and actions."&lt;ref&gt;Ellul, Jacques (1973).

==History==

===Early===
[[File:Napoli BW 2013-05-16 16-24-01 DxO.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of [[Alexander the Great]] on his campaign against the [[Persian Empire]].]]
Since prehistoric times, warlords and chiefs have recognised the importance of weakening morale of  opponents.

In the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)]] between the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] and [[ancient Egypt]], the Persian forces used cats and other animals as a psychological tactic against the Egyptians, who avoided harming cats due to religious belief and spells.

Currying favour with supporters was the other side of psychological warfare, and an early practitioner of such this was [[Alexander the Great]], who [[Wars of Alexander the Great|successfully conquered]] large parts of [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] and held on to his territorial gains by co-opting local elites into the Greek administration and culture. Alexander left some of his men behind in each conquered city to introduce Greek culture and oppress dissident views. His soldiers were paid dowries to marry locals&lt;ref&gt;Lance B. Curke Ph.D., ''The Wisdom of Alexander the Great: Enduring Leadership Lessons From the Man Who Created an Empire'' (2004) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to encourage [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]].

[[Genghis Khan]], leader of the [[Mongolian Empire]] in the 13th century AD employed less subtle techniques. Defeating the will of the enemy before having to attack and reaching a consented settlement was preferable to facing his wrath. The Mongol generals demanded submission to the Khan, and threatened the initially captured villages with complete destruction if they refused to surrender. If they had to fight to take the settlement, the Mongol generals fulfilled their threats and massacred the survivors. Tales of the encroaching horde spread to the next villages and created an aura of insecurity that undermined the possibility of future resistance.&lt;ref&gt;David Nicolle, ''The Mongol Warlords: Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan, Hulegu, Tamerlane'' (2004) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Khan (title)|Khan]] also employed tactics that made his numbers seem greater than they actually were. During night operations he ordered each soldier to light three torches at dusk to give the illusion of an overwhelming army and deceive and intimidate enemy scouts. He also sometimes had objects tied to the tails of his horses, so that riding on open and dry fields raised a cloud of dust that gave the enemy the impression of great numbers. His soldiers used arrows specially notched to whistle as they flew through the air, creating a terrifying noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George H. Quester|title=Offense and Defense in the International System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GVyuYeBGKHcC&amp;pg=PA43|year=2003|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=43|accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tactic favoured by the Mongols was catapulting severed human heads over city walls to frighten the inhabitants and spread disease in the besieged city's closed confines. This was especially used by the later Turko-Mongol chieftain.

The Muslim caliph [[Umar|Omar]], in his battles against the [[Byzantine Empire]], sent small reinforcements in the form of a continuous stream, giving the impression that a large force would accumulate eventually if not swiftly dealt with.

In the 6th century BCE Greek [[Bias of Priene]] successfully resisted the [[Lydia]]n king [[Alyattes of Lydia|Alyattes]] by fattening up a pair of mules and driving them out of the besieged city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diogenes Laertius|title=Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlbias.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Alyattes' envoy was then sent to Priene, Bias had piles of sand covered with corn to give the impression of plentiful resources.

This ruse appears to have been well known in medieval Europe: defenders in castles or towns under siege would throw food from the walls to show besiegers that provisions were plentiful.  A famous example occurs in the 8th-century legend of [[Lady Carcas]], who supposedly persuaded the Franks to abandon a five-year siege by this means and gave her name to [[Carcassonne]] as a result.

===Modern===

====World War I====
[[File:James Bryce.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lord Bryce]] led the [[The Bryce Report|commission]] of 1915 to document German [[Rape of Belgium|atrocities committed against Belgian civilians]].]]
The start of modern psychological operations in war is generally dated to the [[World War I]]. By that point, Western societies were increasingly educated and urbanized, and mass media was available in the form of large circulation [[newspaper]]s and posters. It was also possible to transmit propaganda to the enemy via the use of [[Airborne leaflet propaganda|airborne leaflets]] or through explosive delivery systems like modified artillery or [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds.&lt;ref name="PSYOP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/WWIAllies.html|title=ALLIED PSYOP OF WWI|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the war, the belligerents, especially the British and Germans, began distributing propaganda, both domestically and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western front]]. The British had several advantages that allowed them to succeed in the battle for [[world opinion]]; they had one of the world's most reputable news systems, with much experience in international and cross-cultural communication, and they controlled much of the [[undersea cable]] system then in operation. These capabilities were easily transitioned to the task of warfare.

The British also had a [[diplomatic service]] that kept up good relations with many nations around the world, in contrast to the reputation of the German services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMRBAAAAIAAJ|title=Psychological Warfare|author=Linebarger, Paul Myron Anthony|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; While German attempts to foment revolution in parts of the [[British Empire]], such as [[Ireland]] and [[India]], were ineffective, extensive experience in the [[Middle East]] allowed the British to successfully induce the Arabs to [[Arab revolt|revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].

In August 1914, [[David Lloyd George]] appointed [[Charles Masterman]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]], to head a [[Wellington House|Propaganda Agency]] at Wellington House. A distinguished body of literary talent was enlisted for the task, with its members including [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Ford Madox Ford]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Rudyard Kipling]] and [[H. G. Wells]]. Over 1,160 pamphlets were published during the war and distributed to neutral countries, and eventually, to Germany. One of the first significant publications, the ''[[The Bryce Report|Report on Alleged German Outrages]]'' of 1915, had a great effect on general opinion across the world. The pamphlet documented [[Rape of Belgium|atrocities]], both actual and alleged, committed by the German army against Belgian civilians. A Dutch illustrator, [[Louis Raemaekers]], provided the highly emotional drawings which appeared in the pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Battle for the Mind: German and British Propaganda in the First World War|url=http://quadri.wordpress.com/2008/04/25/the-battle-for-the-mind-german-and-british-propaganda-in-the-first-world-war/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, the bureau was subsumed into the new [[Department of Information (United Kingdom)|Department of Information]] and branched out into [[telegraph]] communications, [[radio]], newspapers, magazines and the cinema. In 1918, [[Viscount Northcliffe]] was appointed Director of Propaganda in Enemy Countries. The department was split between propaganda against Germany organized by H.G Wells and against the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] supervised by [[Wickham Steed]] and [[Robert William Seton-Watson]]; the attempts of the latter focused on the lack of ethnic cohesion in the Empire and stoked the grievances of minorities such as the [[Croatia|Croats]] and [[Slovenia|Slovenes]]. It had a significant effect on the final collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] at the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]].&lt;ref name="PSYOP" /&gt;

Aerial leaflets were dropped over German trenches containing postcards from [[prisoners of war]] detailing their humane conditions, surrender notices and general propaganda against the [[Wilhelm II|Kaiser]] and the German [[general]]s. By the end of the war, [[MI7b]] had distributed almost 26 million leaflets. The Germans began shooting the leaflet-dropping pilots, prompting the British to develop unmanned leaflet balloons that drifted across [[no-man's land]]. At least one in seven of these leaflets were not handed in by the soldiers to their superiors, despite severe penalties for that offence. Even General [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] admitted that "Unsuspectingly, many thousands consumed the poison", and [[Prisoner of War|POWs]] admitted to being disillusioned by the propaganda leaflets that depicted the use of German troops as mere [[cannon fodder]]. In 1915, the British began airdropping a regular leaflet newspaper ''Le Courrier de l'Air'' for civilians in German-occupied France and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmC1mS35ROcC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=British Propaganda in the Twentieth Century: Selling Democracy|author=Taylor, Philip M.|year=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;


At the start of the war, the French government took control of the media to suppress negative coverage. Only in 1916, with the establishment of the Maison de la Presse, did they begin to use similar tactics for the purpose of psychological warfare. One of its sections was the "Service de la Propagande aérienne" (Aerial Propaganda Service), headed by Professor Tonnelat and [[Jean-Jacques Waltz]], an Alsatian artist code-named "''Hansi''". The French tended to distribute leaflets of images only, although the full publication of [[US President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]], which had been heavily edited in the German newspapers, was distributed via airborne leaflets by the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/WWIAlliescont.html |title=ALLIED PSYOP OF WWI|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Central Powers]] were slow to use these techniques; however, at the start of the war the Germans succeeded in inducing the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] to declare 'holy war', or [[Jihad]], against the Western [[infidel]]s. They also attempted to foment rebellion against the [[British Empire]] in places as far afield as [[Ireland]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[India]]. The Germans' greatest success was in giving the Russian revolutionary, [[Lenin]], free transit on a sealed train from [[Switzerland]] to [[Finland]] after the overthrow of the [[Tsar Nicholas II|Tsar]]. This soon paid off when the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] took [[Russia]] out of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/GermanWWIPSYOP.html|title=GERMAN WWI PSYOP|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World War II====
[[File:8th Air Force psychological warfare leaflet.jpg|thumb|An example of a [[World War II]] era leaflet meant to be dropped from an [[B-17 Flying Fortress|American B-17]] over a German city. See the [[:Image:8th Air Force psychological warfare leaflet.jpg|file description page]] for a translation.]]

[[Adolf Hitler]] was greatly influenced by the psychological tactics of warfare the British had employed during WWI, and attributed the defeat of Germany to the effects this propaganda had on the soldiers. He became committed to the use of mass propaganda to influence the minds of the German population in the decades to come. By calling his movement The Third Reich, he was able to convince many civilians that his cause was not just a fad, but the way of their future. [[Joseph Goebbels]] was appointed as [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] when Hitler came to power in 1933, and he portrayed Hitler as a [[messiah|messianic]] figure for the redemption of Germany. Hitler also coupled this with the resonating projections of his orations for effect.

Germany's ''[[Fall Grün (Czechoslovakia)|Fall Grün]]'' plan of invasion of Czechoslovakia had a large part dealing with psychological warfare aimed both at the Czechoslovak civilians and government as well as, crucially, at Czechoslovak allies.&lt;ref name="Hruška"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became successful to the point that Germany gained support of UK and France through [[appeasement]] to occupy Czechoslovakia without having to fight an all-out war, sustaining only minimum losses in [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps#Terrorism|covert war]] before the [[Munich Agreement]].

At the start of the [[Second World War]], the British set up the [[Political Warfare Executive]] to produce and distribute propaganda. Through the use of [[Aspidistra (transmitter)|powerful transmitters]], broadcasts could be made across Europe. [[Sefton Delmer]] managed a successful [[black propaganda]] campaign through several radio stations which were designed to be popular with German troops while at the same time introducing news material that would weaken their morale under a veneer of authenticity. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] made use of radio broadcasts for [[propaganda]] against the Germans.

[[File:Map of Operation Bodyguard subordinate plans.png|thumb|left|Map depicting the targets of all the subordinate plans of [[Operation Bodyguard]].]]
During World War II, the British made extensive use of deception – developing many new techniques and theories. The main protagonists at this time were 'A' Force, set up in 1940 under [[Dudley Clarke]], and the London Controlling Section, chartered in 1942 under the control of John Bevan.&lt;ref name=LatimerBG&gt;Latimer (2004), pg. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Cruickshank (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke pioneered many of the strategies of [[military deception]]. His ideas for combining fictional orders of battle, visual deception and [[double agent]]s helped define Allied deception strategy during the war, for which he has been referred to as "the greatest British deceiver of WW2".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rankin, Nicholas|title=Churchill's Wizards: The British Genius for Deception, 1914–1945|authorlink=Nicholas Rankin|date=1 October 2008|publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]|isbn=0-571-22195-5|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the lead up to the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]], many new tactics in psychological warfare were devised. The plan for [[Operation Bodyguard]] set out a general strategy to mislead German high command as to the exact date and location of the invasion. Planning began in 1943 under the auspices of the [[London Controlling Section]] (LCS). A draft strategy, referred to as Plan Jael, was presented to Allied high command at the [[Tehran Conference]]. [[Operation Fortitude]] was intended to convince the Germans of a greater Allied military strength than existed, through fictional [[field army|field armies]], faked operations to prepare the ground for invasion and leaked information about the Allied order of battle and war plans.

Elaborate [[D-Day naval deceptions|naval deceptions]] (Operations ''Glimmer'', ''Taxable'' and ''Big Drum'') were undertaken in the English Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbier, Mary|title=D-Day Deception: Operation Fortitude and the Normandy Invasion|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date=30 Oct 2007|url={{google books|GXLFo4_2PC8C|page=70|plainurl=y}}|isbn=0275994791|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small ships and aircraft simulated invasion fleets lying off Pas de Calais, Cap d'Antifer and the western flank of the real invasion force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbier, Mary|title=D-Day Deception: Operation Fortitude and the Normandy Invasion|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date=30 Oct 2007|url={{google books|GXLFo4_2PC8C|page=108|plainurl=y}}|isbn=0275994791|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time [[Operation Titanic|Operation ''Titanic'']] involved the [[RAF]] dropping fake paratroopers to the east and west of the Normandy landings.

[[File:DummyShermanTank.jpg|thumb|A dummy [[Sherman tank]], used to deceive the Germans.]]
The deceptions were implemented with the use of [[double agent]]s, radio traffic and visual deception. The British "[[Double-Cross System|Double Cross]]" anti-espionage operation had proven very successful from the outset of the war,&lt;ref name=Masterman&gt;{{cite book |author=Masterman, John C|authorlink=John Cecil Masterman |title=The Double-Cross System in the War of 1939 to 1945 |publisher=Australian National University Press |isbn=978-0-7081-0459-0 |year=1972|origyear=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the LCS was able to use double agents to send back misleading information about Allied invasion plans.&lt;ref name=Ambrose&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Ambrose, Stephen E.|title=Eisenhower, the Intelligence Community, and the D-Day Invasion|authorlink=Stephen E. Ambrose|magazine=The Wisconsin Magazine of History|volume=64|number=4|page=269|ISSN=0043-6534|year = 1981|publisher = Wisconsin Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of visual deception, including mock tanks and other military hardware had been developed during the [[North Africa campaign]]. Mock hardware was created for ''Bodyguard''; in particular, dummy landing craft were stockpiled to give the impression that the invasion would take place near [[Calais]].

The Operation was a strategic success and the [[Normandy landing]]s caught German defences unaware. Subsequent deception led Hitler into delaying reinforcement from the Calais region for nearly seven weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Latimer, John|author-link=Jon Latimer|title=Deception in War|publisher=New York: Overlook Press|year=2001|isbn=978-1-58567-381-0|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vietnam War====
[[File:Vietnampropaganda.png|thumb|left|upright|"Viet Cong, beware!" – [[South Vietnam]] leaflets urging the defection of [[Viet Cong]].]]

The United States ran an extensive program of psychological warfare during the [[Vietnam War]]. The [[Phoenix Program]] had the dual aim of assassinating National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF or [[Viet Cong]]) personnel and terrorizing any potential sympathizers or passive supporters. [[Chieu Hoi]] program of the [[South Vietnam]] government promoted NLF defections.

When members of the PRG were assassinated, [[CIA]] and [[Special Forces]] operatives placed [[playing cards]] in the mouth of the deceased as a calling card.  During the Phoenix Program, over 19,000 NLF supporters were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Janq Designs |url=http://www.specialoperations.com/History/Vietnam/phoenix.html |title=Special operation - Phoenix |publisher=Specialoperations.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512063242/http://www.specialoperations.com/History/Vietnam/phoenix.html |archivedate=May 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States also used tapes of distorted human sounds and played them during the night making the Vietnamese soldiers think that the dead were back for revenge.

====Recent operations====

The [[CIA]] made extensive use of [[Contras|Contra]] soldiers to destabilize the [[Sandinista]] government in [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2005/1/10/is_the_u_s_organizing_salvador|accessdate=2008-12-16|title=Is the U.S. Organizing Salvador-Style Death Squads in Iraq?|work=[[Democracy Now!]]|date=2005-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA used psychological warfare techniques against the [[Panama]]nians by delivering unlicensed TV broadcasts. The United States government has used propaganda broadcasts against the [[Cuba]]n government through [[TV Marti]], based in [[Miami, Florida]]. However, the Cuban government has been successful at jamming the signal of TV Marti.

In the [[Iraq War]], the United States used the [[shock and awe]] campaign to psychologically maim and break the will of the [[Iraqi Army]] to fight.

In cyberspace, [[social media]] has enabled the use of [[disinformation]] on a wide scale. Analysts have found evidence of doctored or misleading photographs spread by social media in the [[Syrian Civil War]] and [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], possibly with state involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://jsis.washington.edu/news/russia-disinformation-ukraine/|accessdate=2017-10-25|title=Countering Disinformation: Russia’s Infowar in Ukraine|work=[[University of Washington]]|date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military and governments have engaged in psychological operations (PSYOPS) and informational warfare on social networking platforms to regulate foreign propaganda, which includes countries like the [[Ntrepid|US]], [[Internet Research Agency|Russia]], and [[50 Cent Party|China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-facebook-trump-and-russia/|accessdate=2017-10-25|title=Countering Disinformation: Russia’s Infowar in Ukraine|work=Wired|date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks|accessdate=2011-03-17|title=Revealed: US spy operation that manipulates social media|work=The Guardian|date=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern uses of the term psychological warfare, refers to the following military methods:
* [[Demoralization (warfare)|Demoralization]]:
** Distributing [[pamphlet]]s that encourage [[desertion]] or supply instructions on how to surrender 
** [[Shock and awe]] military strategy
** Projecting repetitive and annoying sounds and music for long periods at high volume towards groups under siege like during [[Operation Nifty Package]]
** Tolerance indoctrination, so that the totems and culture of a defeated enemy can be removed or replaced without conflict.
* Propaganda radio stations, such as [[Lord Haw-Haw]] in World War II on the "Germany calling" station
* Renaming cities and other places when captured, such as the renaming of Saigon to [[Ho Chi Minh City]] after Vietnamese victory in the [[Vietnam War]]
* [[False flag]] events
* Use of loudspeaker systems to communicate with enemy soldiers
* Terrorism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Boaz | first = Gaynor | title = Terrorism as a strategy of psychological warfare | journal = [[Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment &amp; Trauma]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 33–4 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1300/J146v09n01_03 | date = April 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J146v09n01_03 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The threat of chemical weapons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Romano Jr. | first1 = James A. | last2 = King | first2 = James M. | title = Chemical warfare and chemical terrorism: psychological and performance outcomes | journal = [[Military Psychology (journal)|Military Psychology]] | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 85–92 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1207/S15327876MP1402_2 | date = 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327876MP1402_2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these techniques were developed during World War II or earlier, and have been used to some degree in every conflict since. Daniel Lerner was in the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] (the predecessor to the American CIA) and in his book, attempts to analyze how effective the various strategies were. He concludes that there is little evidence that any of them were dramatically successful, except perhaps surrender instructions over loudspeakers when victory was imminent. It should be noted, though, that measuring the success or failure of psychological warfare is very hard, as the conditions are very far from being a controlled experiment.

Lerner also divides psychological warfare operations into three categories:&lt;ref name=lerner&gt;{{cite book | last = Lerner | first = Daniel | title = Psychological warfare against Nazi Germany: the Sykewar Campaign, D-Day to VE-Day | publisher =  [[MIT Press]] | location = Boston, Mass | year = 1971 | origyear = 1949 | isbn = 0-262-12045-3 }} Originally printed by George W. Stewart of New York. Alternative {{ISBN|0-262-62019-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}
* [[White propaganda]] (Omissions and Emphasis): Truthful and not strongly biased, where the source of information is acknowledged.
* [[Grey propaganda]] (Omissions, Emphasis and Racial/Ethnic/Religious Bias): Largely truthful, containing no information that can be proven wrong; the source is not identified.
* [[Black propaganda]] (Commissions of falsification): Inherently deceitful, information given in the product is attributed to a source that was not responsible for its creation.

Lerner points out that grey and black operations ultimately have a heavy cost, in that the target population sooner or later recognizes them as propaganda and discredits the source. He writes, "This is one of the few dogmas advanced by Sykewarriors that is likely to endure as an axiom of propaganda: Credibility is a condition of persuasion. Before you can make a man do as you say, you must make him believe what you say."&lt;ref name=lerner/&gt;{{Rp|28|date=May 2009}} Consistent with this idea, the Allied strategy in [[World War II]] was predominantly one of truth (with certain exceptions).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

=== Soviet Union ===
{{Main article|Zersetzung|Russian military deception|Active measures}}

===China===
According to [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] analysts, attacking the enemy’s mind is an important element  of the [[People's Republic of China]]'s military strategy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cero11.cise.ufl.edu/~webmaster/Learning_Modules/MIL/content/MIL_psychologica.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415101011/http://cero11.cise.ufl.edu/~webmaster/Learning_Modules/MIL/content/MIL_psychologica.html|title=Chinese Military - Psychological Warfare|archivedate=15 April 2011|work=ufl.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of warfare is rooted in the Chinese Stratagems outlined by [[Sun Tzu]] in ''[[The Art of War]]'' and ''[[Thirty-Six Stratagems]]''. In its dealings with its rivals, China is expected to utilize [[Marxism]] to mobilize [[communism|communist]] loyalists, as well as flex its economic and military muscle to persuade other nations to act in China's interests. The Chinese government also tries to control the media to keep a tight hold on [[propaganda]] efforts for its people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Germany===
In the [[Germany|German]] [[Bundeswehr]], the '''Zentrum Operative Information''' and its subordinate '''Batallion für Operative Information 950''' are responsible for the PSYOP efforts (called '''Operative Information''' in [[German language|German]]). Both the center and the [[battalion]] are subordinate to the new ''[[Streitkräftebasis]]'' (Joint Services Support Command, SKB) and together consist of about 1,200 soldiers specialising in modern communication and media technologies. One project of the German PSYOP forces is the radio station ''[[Stimme der Freiheit]]'' (Sada-e Azadi, Voice of Freedom),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sada-e-azadi.net/Joomla/index.php?lang=en |title=Sada-e-azadi.net |publisher=Sada-e-azadi.net |date= |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512063231/http://www.sada-e-azadi.net/Joomla/index.php?lang=en |archivedate=May 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; heard by thousands of [[Afghanistan|Afghans]]. Another is the publication of various newspapers and magazines in [[Kosovo]] and [[Afghanistan]], where German soldiers serve with [[NATO]].

===United Kingdom===
The British were one of the first major military powers to use psychological warfare in the First and Second World Wars. In current the [[British Armed Forces]], PSYOPS are handled by the tri-service [[Defence Intelligence and Security Centre|15 Psychological Operations Group]]. (See also [[MI5]] and [[Secret Intelligence Service]]). The Psychological Operations Group comprises over 150 personnel, approximately 75 from the regular Armed Services and 75 from the Reserves. The Group supports deployed commanders in the provision of psychological operations in operational and tactical environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/15psyops/index.htm  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620154544/http://www.army.mod.uk/15psyops/index.htm  |archivedate=2006-06-20  |title=15 (UK) Psychological Operations Group |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/psychological-ops-group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702002020/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/psychological-ops-group |archivedate=2010-07-02 |title=Psychological Ops Group |publisher=Royal Navy |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term psychological warfare is believed to have migrated from Germany to the United States in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;WALL, TYLER. "U.S. Psychological Warfare And Civilian Targeting." Peace Review 22.3 (2010): 288-294. SocINDEX with Full Text. Web. 20 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], the United States [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] defined psychological warfare broadly, stating "Psychological warfare employs ''any'' weapon to influence the mind of the enemy. The weapons are psychological only in the effect they produce and not because of the weapons themselves."&lt;ref&gt;From "Overall Strategic Plan for the United States' Psychological Warfare, " 1 March 1943, JCS Records, Strategic Issues, Reel 11.  Quoted in {{Cite book|title=Austria in World War II|author=Robert H. Keyserlingk|page=131|date=July 1990|isbn=0-7735-0800-7|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] currently defines psychological warfare as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The planned use of [[propaganda]] and other [[psychological]] actions having the primary purpose of influencing the opinions, emotions, attitudes, and behavior of hostile foreign groups in such a way as to support the achievement of national objectives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/vp01.cfm?outfit=pmt&amp;folder=64&amp;paper=665 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HZfxMLKn?url=http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/vp01.cfm?outfit=pmt&amp;folder=64&amp;paper=665 |archivedate=2013-06-22 |title=Glossary of Relevant Terms &amp; Acronyms Propaganda and Psychological Warfare Studies University of Leeds UK |accessdate=2008-04-19 |author=Phil Taylor |year=1987 |work= |publisher=University of Leeds UK |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition indicates that a critical element of the U.S. psychological operations capabilities includes [[propaganda]] and by extension [[counterpropaganda]]. Joint Publication 3-53 establishes specific policy to use public affairs mediums to counterpropaganda from foreign origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Garrison |first= WC |year=1999 |title=Information Operations and Counter-Propaganda: Making a Weapon of Public Affairs |work=Strategy Research Project, U.S. Army War College |page= 12 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a363892.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= April 4, 2012}}&lt;!-- 12 ? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of [[United States]] psychological operations is to induce or reinforce attitudes and behaviors favorable to US objectives.  The [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) is a division of the Central Intelligence Agency's [[National Clandestine Service]], responsible for Covert Action and "Special Activities". These special activities include covert political influence (which includes psychological operations) and paramilitary operations.&lt;ref name="Executive Secrets 2004"&gt;Executive Secrets: Covert Action and the Presidency, William J. Daugherty, University of Kentucky Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  SAD's political influence group is the only US unit allowed to conduct these operations covertly and is considered the primary unit in this area.&lt;ref name="Executive Secrets 2004"/&gt;

Dedicated psychological operations units exist in the [[United States Army]]. The [[United States Navy]] also plans and executes limited PSYOP missions. United States PSYOP units and soldiers of all branches of the military are prohibited by law from targeting U.S. citizens with PSYOP within the borders of the United States (Executive Order S-1233, DOD Directive S-3321.1, and National Security Decision Directive 130). While United States Army PSYOP units may offer non-PSYOP support to domestic military missions, they can only target foreign audiences.

A U.S. Army field manual released in January 2013 states that "Inform and Influence Activities" are critical for describing, directing, and leading military operations. Several Army Division leadership staff are assigned to “planning, integration and synchronization of designated information-related capabilities."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-gearing-up-to-fight-the-pr-war/2013/02/06/b3a9a582-6ef0-11e2-aa58-243de81040ba_story.html "Pentagon gearing up to fight the PR war"] ''Washington Post'', February 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RESOL''' – Elektronische Regelungen GmbH is a German solar thermal technology company based in Hattingen. It is, according to a market survey of Sun &amp; Wind Energy magazine (issue 2/2007), the worldwide market leader in solar thermal control technology with a market share of almost 50%. Among the products are solar thermal controllers, pump stations and a range of additional modules and accessories. 100% of the company is owned by its founder and General Manager, Mr. Rudolf Pfeil.

== History ==

RESOL was founded in Hattingen in 1977, where the founder produced the first solar controllers in his own private flat. A few years later, the enterprise moved to the neighbouring town of Sprockhövel, but moved back to Hattingen into a new building in 1998. In 2007, another new building was added, and currently (April 2009) an annexe to the first plant is being built. It will be inaugurated in summer, increasing the total plant and office space to 6,600 m².

Today (2009), RESOL employs 160 people; in 2008, a 29 Mio. Euro turnover was generated.

== Growth through process management ==

In the 32 years since its founding, RESOL has grown from a one-man-company into a market leading enterprise which is active all over the world. Especially during the last few years, the growth rate increased enormously, leading to a record growth rate of nearly 80% in 2008.

Crucial for this development was the implementation of an intensive process management, which was started in 2005. With the help of a consultancy that specialises in the implementation of synchronous production systems on the basis of the Toyota Production System, the assembly lines were turned from a manufactory into a flexible, efficient industrial production. Process chains have been streamlined, workplace layouts changed radically and the cycle times have been shortened considerably.

The investment and the effort paid off – since the implementation of the synchronous production, the turnover generated by RESOL increased by more than 400%.

== Locations ==

Research and development, production as well as administration take place in the RESOL headquarters in Hattingen, Germany.

RESOL has subsidiaries in France and in Spain as well as agencies in the UK, Sweden and Bulgaria. Authorised distributors sell RESOL products in Poland, the Czech Republic, Russia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Jordan, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, the US, Canada and Japan.

Due to several strategic partnerships with companies that distribute RESOL products under their own brands as OEM clients, controllers made by RESOL can be found in more than 50 countries worldwide.

== Awards ==

For outstanding commitment to the generation and usage of solar energy, RESOL was awarded with the title „Solar-Unternehmen 2000” (solar company 2000) by the „Solar-Unternehmen 2001+” initiative.

In 2001, the FlowCon Pro pump station was presented with the [[IF Design Award]], awarded by the iF International Forum Design GmbH. In the year 2008, the award again came to Hattingen, this time for the FlowCon D pump station.

The FlowCon Pro pump station also won the ISH [http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Design_Plus_Award&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1 Design Plus Award].

Several RESOL products have been presented with the [[Red dot design award]] of the Design Zentrum Nordrhein Westfalen, for example the solar controllers RS600 MIDI and DeltaSol A as well as the FlowCon S pump station.

At [[Intersolar]] trade fair in Munich, May 2009, the newly developed RESOL FlowCon Sensor pump station was presented with the Intersolar Award in the solar thermal category.

'''Racetrack memory''' or '''domain-wall memory''' ('''DWM''') is an experimental [[non-volatile memory]] device under development at [[IBM]]'s [[Almaden Research Center]] by a team led by physicist [[Stuart Parkin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almaden.ibm.com/spinaps/research/sd/?racetrack Spintronics Devices Research, Magnetic Racetrack Memory Project]&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2008, a 3-bit version was successfully demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Masamitsu Hayashi |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/320/5873/209 |title=Current-Controlled Magnetic Domain-Wall Nanowire Shift Register |journal=Science |volume=320|issue=5873|pages=209–211|date=April 2008|doi=10.1126/science.1154587|display-authors=etal |pmid=18403706}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it were to be developed successfully, racetrack would offer [[computer storage density|storage density]] higher than comparable solid-state memory devices like [[flash memory]] and similar to conventional [[disk drive]]s, with higher read/write performance.&lt;ref name="stap16dwm" /&gt;

==Description==
Racetrack memory uses a [[spin (physics)|spin]]-coherent [[electric current]] to move [[magnetic domain]]s along a nanoscopic [[permalloy]] wire about 200&amp;nbsp;nm across and 100&amp;nbsp;nm thick. As current is passed through the wire, the domains pass by magnetic [[read/write head]]s positioned near the wire, which alter the domains to record patterns of bits. A racetrack memory device is made up of many such wires and read/write elements. In general operational concept, racetrack memory is similar to the earlier [[bubble memory]] of the 1960s and 1970s. [[Delay line memory]], such as mercury delay lines of the 1940s and 1950s, are a still-earlier form of similar technology, as used in the [[UNIVAC]] and [[EDSAC]] computers. Like bubble memory, racetrack memory uses electrical currents to "push" a sequence of magnetic domains through a substrate and past read/write elements. Improvements in magnetic detection capabilities, based on the development of [[spintronic]] [[magnetoresistive]] sensors, allow the use of much smaller magnetic domains to provide far higher bit densities.

In production, it was expected{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} that the wires could be scaled down to around 50&amp;nbsp;nm. There were two arrangements considered for racetrack memory. The simplest was a series of flat wires arranged in a grid with read and write heads arranged nearby. A more widely studied arrangement used U-shaped wires arranged vertically over a grid of read/write heads on an underlying substrate. This would allow the wires to be much longer without increasing its 2D area, although the need to move individual domains further along the wires before they reach the read/write heads results in slower random access times. Both arrangements offered about the same throughput performance. The primary concern in terms of construction was practical; whether or not the three dimensional vertical arrangement would be feasible to mass-produce.

==Comparison to other memory devices==
&lt;!--{{cleanup|section|date=September 2016|reason=Descriptions of Flash and memory cost make the section verbose}}--&gt;
Projections in 2008 suggested that racetrack memory would offer performance on the order of 20-32&amp;nbsp;ns to read or write a random bit. This compared to about 10,000,000&amp;nbsp;ns for a [[Hard disk drive|hard drive]], or 20-30&amp;nbsp;ns for conventional [[DRAM]]. The primary authors discussed ways to improve the access times with the use of a "reservoir" to about 9.5&amp;nbsp;ns. Aggregate throughput, with or without the reservoir, would be on the order of 250-670&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s for racetrack memory, compared to 12800 Mbit/s for a single DDR3 DRAM, 1000 Mbit/s for high-performance hard drives, and 1000 to 4000&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s for flash memory devices. The only current technology that offered a clear latency benefit over racetrack memory was [[Static random access memory|SRAM]], on the order of 0.2&amp;nbsp;ns, but at a higher cost. larger feature size "F" of about 45&amp;nbsp;nm (as of 2011) with a cell area of about 140 F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ITRS 2011 |url=http://www.itrs.net/Links/2011ITRS/2011Tables/ERD_2011Tables.xlsx |accessdate=8 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parsci&gt;{{cite journal |author=Parkin |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/320/5873/190 |title=Magnetic Domain-Wall Racetrack Memory |journal=Science |volume=320|issue=5873 |pages=190–4 |date=11 April 2008 |doi=10.1126/science.1145799 |pmid=18403702 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Flash memory is asymmetrical. Read performance is faster than writing. Flash memory works by "trapping" [[electron]]s in the chip surface. It requires a burst of high voltage to remove this charge and reset the cell. In order to do this, charge is accumulated in a [[charge pump]], which takes time. In the case of [[NOR flash]] memory, which allows bit-wise random access like racetrack memory, read times were on the order of 70&amp;nbsp;ns, while write times were much slower, about 2,500&amp;nbsp;ns. To address this concern, [[NAND flash]] memory allows reading and writing only in blocks, but this means that the time to access any random ''bit'' is increased to about 1,000&amp;nbsp;ns. In addition, the use of the burst of high voltage physically degrades the cell, so most flash devices allow on the order of 100,000 writes to any particular bit before their operation becomes unpredictable. [[Wear leveling]] and other techniques can spread this out if the underlying data can be re-arranged.--&gt;
&lt;!--The key determinant of the cost of any memory device is the physical size of the storage medium. This is due to the way memory devices are fabricated. In the case of solid-state devices like flash memory or DRAM, a large "wafer" of silicon is processed into many individual devices, which are then cut apart and packaged. The cost of packaging is about $1 per device, so, as the density increases and the number of bits per devices increases with it, the ''cost per bit'' falls by an equal amount. In hard drives, data is stored on rotating platters, and the cost of the drive is strongly related to the number of platters. Increasing the density allows the number of platters to be reduced for any given amount of storage. --&gt;

Racetrack memory is one among several emerging technologies that aim to replace conventional memories such as DRAM and Flash, and potentially offer a [[universal memory]] device applicable to a wide variety of roles.&lt;ref name="stap16dwm"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/28267727 |doi=10.1145/0000000.0000000|title=A Survey of Techniques for Architecting Processor Components Using Domain-Wall Memory|journal=ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems|volume=13|issue=2|pages=1–25|last1=Mittal|first1=Sparsh|doi-broken-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contenders included [[magnetoresistive random-access memory]] (MRAM), [[phase-change memory]] (PCRAM) and [[ferroelectric RAM]] (FeRAM). Most of these technologies offer densities similar to flash memory, in most cases worse, and their primary advantage is the lack of write-endurance limits like those in flash memory. Field-MRAM offers excellent performance as high as 3&amp;nbsp;ns access time, but requires a large 25-40&amp;nbsp;F² cell size. It might see use as an SRAM replacement, but not as a mass storage device. The highest densities from any of these devices is offered by PCRAM, with a cell size of about 5.8&amp;nbsp;F², similar to flash memory, as well as fairly good performance around 50&amp;nbsp;ns. Nevertheless, none of these can come close to competing with racetrack memory in overall terms, especially density. For example, 50&amp;nbsp;ns allows about five bits to be operated in a racetrack memory device, resulting in an effective cell size of 20/5=4&amp;nbsp;F², easily exceeding the performance-density product of PCM. On the other hand, without sacrificing bit density, the same 20&amp;nbsp;F² area could fit 2.5 2-bit 8&amp;nbsp;F² alternative memory cells (such as [[resistive RAM]] (RRAM) or [[MRAM|spin-torque transfer MRAM]]), each of which individually operating much faster (~10&amp;nbsp;ns).

In most cases, memory devices store one bit in any given location, so they are typically compared in terms of "cell size", a cell storing one bit. Cell size itself is given in units of F², where "F" is the feature size [[design rule checking|design rule]], representing usually the metal line width. Flash and racetrack both store multiple bits per cell, but the comparison can still be made. For instance, hard drives appeared to be reaching theoretical limits around 650&amp;nbsp;nm²/bit,&lt;ref&gt;1&amp;nbsp;Tbit/in² is approx. 650nm²/bit.&lt;/ref&gt; defined primarily by the capability to read and write to specific areas of the magnetic surface. DRAM has a cell size of about 6&amp;nbsp;F², SRAM is much less dense at 120&amp;nbsp;F². NAND flash memory is currently the densest form of non-volatile memory in widespread use, with a cell size of about 4.5&amp;nbsp;F², but storing three bits per cell for an effective size of 1.5&amp;nbsp;F². NOR flash memory is slightly less dense, at an effective 4.75&amp;nbsp;F², accounting for 2-bit operation on a 9.5&amp;nbsp;F² cell size.&lt;ref name=parsci/&gt; In the vertical orientation (U-shaped) racetrack, nearly 10-20 bits are stored per cell, which itself would have a physical size of at least about 20&amp;nbsp;F². In addition, bits at different positions on the "track" would take different times (from ~10 to ~1000&amp;nbsp;ns, or 10&amp;nbsp;ns/bit) to be accessed by the read/write sensor, because the "track" would move the domains at a fixed rate of ~100&amp;nbsp;m/s past the read/write sensor. There are software utilities for modeling single and multi-bit racetrack memory designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3390/jlpea7030023 | volume=7 | issue=3 | title=DESTINY: A Comprehensive Tool with 3D and Multi-Level Cell Memory Modeling Capability | year=2017 | journal=Journal of Low Power Electronics and Applications | page=23 | author=Mittal Sparsh, Wang Rujia, Vetter Jeffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development challenges==
One limitation of the early experimental devices was that the magnetic domains could be pushed only slowly through the wires, requiring current pulses on the orders of microseconds to move them successfully. This was unexpected, and led to performance equal roughly to that of [[hard drive]]s, as much as 1000 times slower than predicted. Recent research has traced this problem to microscopic imperfections in the crystal structure of the wires which led to the domains becoming "stuck" at these imperfections. Using an [[X-ray microscope]] to directly image the boundaries between the domains, their research found that domain walls would be moved by pulses as short as a few nanoseconds when these imperfections were absent. This corresponds to a macroscopic performance of about 110&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11837-racetrack-memory-could-gallop-past-the-hard-disk.html 'Racetrack' memory could gallop past the hard disk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The voltage required to drive the domains along the racetrack would be proportional to the length of the wire. The current density must be sufficiently high to push the domain walls (as in [[electromigration]]). A difficulty for racetrack technology arises from the need for high [[current density]] (&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; A/cm²); a 30&amp;nbsp;nm x 100&amp;nbsp;nm cross-section would require &gt;3&amp;nbsp;mA. The resulting power draw becomes higher than that required for other memories, e.g., spin-transfer torque memory (STT-RAM) or flash memory.

Another challenge associated with Racetrack memory is the stochastic nature in which the domain walls move, i.e., they move and stop at random positions. There have been attempts to overcome this challenge by producing notches at the edges of the nanowire &lt;ref&gt;M. Hayashi, L. Thomas, R. Moriya, C. Rettner, and S. S. Parkin, "Current-controlled magnetic domain-wall nanowire shift register," Sci., vol. 320, pp. 209-211, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;. Researchers have also proposed stepped nanowires to pin the domain walls precisely. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/srep28590| pmid=27334038| pmc=4917858|title = Geometrically pinned magnetic domain wall for multi-bit per cell storage memory| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=6| pages=28590|year = 2016|last1 = Bahri|first1 = M.

[[Image:Rice-planting-machine 2,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|A riding type rice transplanter in Japan]]
A '''rice transplanter''' is a specialized [[Farm equipment|transplanter]] fitted to transplant [[rice]] [[Germination|seedlings]] onto [[paddy field]]. Mainly two types of rice transplanter i.e., riding type and walking type. Riding type is power driven and can usually transplant six lines in one pass. On the other hand, walking type is manually driven and can usually transplant four lines in one pass.

Although rice is grown in areas other than [[Asia]], rice transplanters are used mainly in East, Southeast, and South Asia.  This is because rice can be grown without transplanting, by simply sowing seeds on field, and farmers outside Asia prefer this fuss-free way at the expense of reduced yield.

A common rice transplanter comprises:
* a seedling tray like a shed roof on which mat type rice nursery is set;
* a seedling tray shifter that shifts the seedling tray like a carriage of typewriters; and
*[[File:Rice transplanter.JPG|thumb|A Korea made walking type rice transplanter]]plural pickup forks that pick up a [[seedling]] from mat type nursery on the seedling tray and put the seedling into the earth, as if the seedling were taken between human fingers.

Machine transplanting using rice transplanters requires considerably less time and labor than manual transplanting.  It increases the approximate area that a person can plant from 700 to 10,000 square metres per day.

However, rice transplanters are considerably expensive for almost all Asian small-hold farmers.  Rice transplanters are popular in industrialized countries where labor cost is high, for example in [[South Korea]]. It is now also becoming more popular in South Asian countries because, at transplanting time, labour shortage is at peak levels.

Rice transplanters were first developed in [[Japan]] in the 1960s, whereas the earliest attempt to mechanize rice transplanting dates back to late 19th century. In Japan, development and spread of rice transplanters progressed rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5920">'''Software diagnosis''' (also: ''software diagnostics'') refers to concepts, techniques, and tools that allow for obtaining findings, conclusions, and evaluations about [[software system]]s and their implementation, composition, behavior, and evolution. It serves as means to monitor, steer, observe and optimize software development, software maintenance, and software re-engineering in the sense of a [[business intelligence]] approach specific to software systems. It is generally based on the automatic extraction, analysis, and visualization of corresponding information sources of the software system. It can also be manually done and not automatic.

== Applications ==
Software diagnosis supports all branches of [[software engineering]], in particular project management, quality management, risk management as well as implementation and test. Its main strength is to support all stakeholders of software projects (in particular during [[software maintenance]] and for software re-engineering tasks&lt;ref&gt;Martin Beck, Jonas Trümper, Jürgen Döllner: "A Visual Analysis and Design Tool for Planning Software Reengineerings". Proceedings of the 6th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 54-61, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) and to provide effective communication means for [[software development]] projects. For example, software diagnosis facilitates "bridging an essential information gap between management and development, improve awareness, and serve as early risk detection instrument".&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bohnet, Jürgen Döllner: "Monitoring Code Quality and Development Activity by Software Maps". Proceedings of the IEEE ACM ICSE Workshop on Managing Technical Debt, pp. 9-16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Software diagnosis includes assessment methods for "perfective maintenance" that, for example, apply "visual analysis techniques to combine multiple indicators for low maintainability, including code complexity and entanglement with other parts of the system, and recent changes applied to the code".&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Trümper et al.: "A Visual Analysis Approach to Support Perfective Software Maintenance". Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 308-315, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
In contrast to manifold approaches and techniques in [[software engineering]], software diagnosis does not depend on programming languages, modeling techniques, software development processes or the specific techniques used in the various stages of the software development process. Instead, software diagnosis aims at analyzing and evaluating the software system in its as-is state and based on system-generated information to bybass any subjective or potentially outdated information sources (e.g., initial software models). For it, software diagnosis combines and relates sources of information that are typically not directly linked. Examples: 
* Source-code metrics are related with software developer activity to gain insight into developer-specific effects on software code quality.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Limberger et al.: "Interactive Software Maps for Web-Based Source Code Analysis". Proceedings of the International Web3D Conference, ACM, pp. 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* System structure and run-time execution traces are correlated to facilitate program comprehension through dynamic analysis in software maintenance tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Trümper et al.: "ViewFusion: Correlating Structure and Activity Views for Execution Traces". Proceedings of the 10th Theory and Practice of Computer Graphics Conference, European Association for Computer Graphics, pp. 45-52, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
The core principle of software diagnosis is to automatically extract information from all available information sources of a given software projects such as source code base, project repository, code metrics, execution traces,&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bohnet: "Visualization of Execution Traces and its Application to Software Maintenance". PhD thesis, Hasso-Plattner-Institut, University of Potsdam, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; test results, etc. To combine information, software-specific data mining, analysis, and visualization techniques are applied. Its strength results, among various reasons, from integrating decoupled information spaces in the scope of a typical software project, for example development and developer activities (recorded by the repository) and code and quality metrics (derived by analyzing source code) or key performance indicators (KPIs).

== Examples ==
Examples of software diagnosis tools include [[software map]]s and [[software metrics]].

== Critics ==
Software diagnosis—in contrast to many approaches in software engineering—does not assume that developer capabilities, development methods, programming or modeling languages are right or wrong (or better or worse compared to each other): Software diagnosis aims at giving insight into a given software system and its status ''regardless of the methods, languages, or models'' used to create and maintain the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5429">'''Staged detonation''' is an overall principle used for many explosive devices. A general description of the principle is that one explosive '''[[Chemical compound|compound]]''' with one set of properties is detonated, and the '''[[detonation wave]]''' from this is transfers into another explosive compound with different set of properties.

The principle is most often used for detonating insensitive explosive compounds by using stages of less and less sensitive explosive compounds. A simple example is the common industrial detonator, where a very small amount of a sensitive explosive detonates, causing the less sensitive main charge of the detonator to detonate. It may involve additional steps where successively less sensitive compounds trigger a detonation wave in each other, with stages including various types of [[booster charge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SoldR Mtrl Vapen : Spräng- och Tändmedel|date=2002|publisher=Swedish Defence, Department of Books and Forms|location=Sweden|page=15 and forward|edition="Edition of 2002"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Staged detonation''' may be used to initiate cheap and insensitive mining explosives, but the principle has other uses. In certain applications there is a need to modify the shape of a detonation wave travelling through an explosive material. One example of this can be found in [[explosive lens]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fritz|first1=J.

It does not necessarily involve different explosive compounds. Because the properties of an explosive compound is in some degree related to its density,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fidler|first1=Baron|title=Explosive Characteristics and Performance|url=http://www.quarryacademy.com/cmsMats/Day3_302_ExpCharPerformance_Fidler.pdf|website=Quarry Academy|publisher=Quarry Academy, Dyno Nobel, Sandvik Mining|accessdate=14 April 2015|pages=4–7, 11, 17–19, 22, 27–28, 29, 34, 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a result of with what pressure it is compressed during manufacture, the stages in a staged detonation may also come from each section having been pressed to a different density, giving it varying properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Renpu|first1=Wan|title=Advanced Well Completion Engineering|date=23 Aug 2011|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|isbn=9780123858689|page=192|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''Staged detonation''' may also refer to a method where several explosive charges are set to detonate in series with a given delay between them.

==History and Development of the Principle==
The use of a primary and secondary explosive was the first practical use of the staged detonation principle, and was revolutionary to the safety of the mining industry. After this staged detonation is used in everything from explosive lenses in nuclear weapons (where the different properties of each explosive create a perfectly spherical detonation wave moving in towards origo) to mining where each blasting operation requires several stages to detonate each main charge, not only the primary and secondary explosive used in the simplest staged detonation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SoldR Mtrl Vapen : Spräng- och Tändmedel|date=2002|publisher=Swedish Defence, Department of Books and Forms|location=Sweden|page=15 and forward|edition="Edition of 2002"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Superadobe''' is a form of [[earthbag construction]] that was developed by Iranian architect [[Nader Khalili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calearth.org/building-designs/what-is-superadobe.html |title=Superadobe - What is Superadobe? |publisher=Calearth.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique uses layered long fabric tubes or bags filled with [[adobe]] to form a compression structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhomebuilding.com/weblog/2007/08/short-history-of-earthbag-building.htm |title=Green Home Building and Sustainable Architecture: A Short History of Earthbag Building |publisher=Greenhomebuilding.com |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[Beehive house|beehive]] shaped structures employs [[corbelled arch]]es, [[Dome#Corbel dome|corbelled domes]], and vaults to create sturdy single and double-curved shells. It has received growing interest for the past two decades in the [[natural building]] and [[sustainability]] movements.

==History==
Although it is not known exactly how long, Earth bag shelters have been used for decades, primarily as implements of refuge in times of war.  Military infantrymen have used sand filled sacks to create bunkers and barriers for protection prior to [[World War I]].  In the last century other earthbag buildings have undergone extensive research and are slowly beginning to gain worldwide recognition as a plausible solution to provide affordable housing. 
German architect [[Frei Otto]] is said to have experimented with earth bags, as is more recently Gernot Minke. It was [[Nader Khalili]] who popularized earthbag construction. Initially in 1984 in response to a [[NASA]] call for housing designs for future human settlements on the Moon and on Mars he proposed to use moon dust to fill the plastic Superadobe tubes and [[velcro]] together the layers (instead of barbed wire). He came to term his particular technique of earthbag construction "Superadobe".  Some projects have been done using bags as low-tech foundations for [[straw-bale construction]]. They can be covered in a waterproof membrane to keep the straw dry.
In 1995 15 refugee shelters were built in Iran, by Nader Khalili and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) in response to refugees from the Persian Gulf War. According to Khalili the cluster of 15 domes that was built could have been repeated by the thousands. The government dismantled the camp a few years later.
Since then, the Superadobe Method has been put to use in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Belize, Costa Rica, Chile, Iran, India, Russia, Mali, and Thailand, as well as in the U.S.
While Superadobe constructions have generally been limited to approximately 4 meters in diameter, larger structures have been created by grouping several "beehives" together to form a network of domes. There is a 32' (10m) dome being constructed{{When|date=February 2010}} in the St. Ignacio area of Belize, which when finished will be the centre dome of an eco-resort complex.

==Methodology==

Superadobe's earthbag technique lends itself to a wide range of materials. [[Polypropylene]] tubing is ideal, although [[burlap]] is also sufficient.  Likewise, while sand, cement or lime are preferred, virtually any fill material (e.g. gravel, crushed volcanic rock or rice hulls) will work. 

After materials are gathered and the dimensions of the building are decided upon, a circular foundation trench is dug, approximately 1 foot deep and 8-14 feet in diameter, giving room for at least two layers of earthbags to be laid down underground.  A chain is anchored to the ground in the center of the circle and used like a pair of compasses to trace the shape of the base.  Another chain is fastened just outside the dome wall: this is the fixed or height guide and provides an interior measurement for the layers as they corbel higher, ensuring the accuracy of each new layer as it is laid and tamped. 

Between layers of tamped, filled tubes, loop of barbed wire functions as mortar and holds the structure together.  Window voids can be placed in several ways: either by rolling the filled tube back on itself around a circular plug (forming an arched header) or by sawing out a Gothic or pointed arch void after the filler material has set.  

Once the corbelled dome is complete, it can be covered in several different kinds of exterior treatments, both for aesthetic reasons and to protect the structure from environmental damage such as that from ultraviolet radiation.  Like the materials for the construction itself, there are multiple choices.  While CalEarth names plaster as the most common finishing option, soil and living grass have also been used. Khalili has also used a mix of earth and plaster, further covered by a "reptile" layer of cement and earth balls that strengthen the finish by redirecting stress.

==Emergency shelters==
According to Khalili's website, in an emergency, impermanent shelters can be built with unskilled labor, using only dirt with no cement or lime, and for the sake of speed of construction windows can be punched out later due to the strength of the compressive nature of the dome/beehive.  Superadobe is not an exact art and similar materials may be substituted if the most ideal ones are not readily available. Ordinary sand bags can also be used to form the dome if no Superadobe tubes can be procured; this in fact was how the original design was developed.  

In an interview with an AIA (American Institute of Architects) representative, Nader Khalili, super adobe’s founder and figurehead, said this about the emergency shelter aspects of Superadobe: {{Quote|A {{convert|400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} house, with bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and entry — I call it the Eco-Dome — can be put up in about four weeks, by one skilled and four unskilled people. Emergency shelters can go up much more quickly. After the Gulf War, the United Nations sent an architect here. We trained him, and he went to the Persian Gulf and put them up with refugees as they arrived at the camps. Every five incoming refugees put up a simple structure in five days. It's emergency shelter, but if you cover it with waterproofing and stucco, it will last for 30 or more years.}}

An '''upholstery regulator''' is an [[upholstery]] [[tool]] which smooths irregularities in the stuffing beneath the coverings. 

Whilst it looks similar to a needle it is heavier; like needles the regulator comes in various gauges and lengths. It is used to poke through the various layers to adjust the stuffing before the final cover is put in place. 

A related tool is the [[stuffing iron]], which is used to push the stuffing into the curves and corners of a piece of furniture; it has a narrow piece of steel with one toothed edge to grab loose stuffing and place it in the hard to reach spots.

'''Vermiponics''' is a soil-less growing technique that combines [[hydroponics]] with [[vermiculture]] by utilizing diluted wormbin leachate ("worm tea") as the nutrient solution&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal=Journal of Sustainability Science and Management |volume=9 |issue=1 |year=2014 |pages=49–55
|title=Growth Impact, Photosynthetic Pigments and Heavy Metals Content of ''Coleus aromaticus'': A Vermiponic Approach

In 2008, [[Saginaw Valley State University]] in Michigan was using vermiponics as part of its efforts to reduce waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.mlive.com/bctimes/2008/05/svsu_reducing_its_food_paper_w.html|title=SVSU reducing its food, paper waste with garbage-eating, compost-making  worms|author=Jeff Kart |date=May 8, 2008| work=[[Booth Newspapers]]|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aquaponics]] growers have noted previously that redworms can be added to aquaponic grow beds successfully and serve useful functions in aquaponic systems. This has led several people to experiment with nutrient solutions that are based on wormbin leachate alone, for instance in a Central Queensland University trial.&lt;ref name=Roe&amp;Midmore&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hydroponics.com.au/issue103-sustainable-aquaponics/ |journal=Practical Hydroponics &amp; Greenhouses |author1=Brett R. Roe  |author2=David J. Midmore  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Sustainable Aquaponics |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effectiveness of vermiponics compared to hydroponics and aquaponics has not been thoroughly studied however a paper from the University of Arizona has found that using wormtea has beneficial effects on root protrusion in lettuce seedlings when compared to inorganic fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Haug‐Baltzell"&gt;{{citation |url=https://arboretum.arizona.edu/sites/arboretum.arizona.edu/files/Haug-Baltzell%202011%20Research.pdf |title=The Suitability of Worm Castings &amp; Compost Tea in Organic Hydroponic Lettuce Propagation |author=Asher Haug‐Baltzell |accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As hydroponics is based on feeding plants inorganic fertilizer and as many aquaponic growers use commercial fish feed, it has been suggested that vermiponics is a more sustainable method of food production as worm castings can be used from local food waste rather than mined fertilizer or sea caught fish.&lt;ref name=Roe&amp;Midmore/&gt;
