      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6355">'''''Agimat''''' or '''''bertud''''' or '''''anting-anting''''', is a [[Filipino language|Filipino]] word for "[[amulet]]" or "[[Touch pieces|charm]]".&lt;ref name="TE"&gt;"Tagalog-English Dictionary by Leo James English, Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, Manila, distributed by National Book Store, 1583 pages, {{ISBN|971-91055-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anting-anting'' is also a Filipino system of magic and sorcery with special use of the above-mentioned talismans, amulets, and charms.  It is part of a wider South-East Asian tradition of tribal jewelry, as "''gantung''" (meaning "''hanging''") in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian/Malay]] and "''anting-anting''" (meaning "ear pendant") in [[Javanese language|Javanese]].

==Types of Agimat==
In the Philippine occult tradition, there is usually a corresponding ''agimat'' to deal with in a particular area in a person's life. The most frequent types of ''agimat'' are used for removing hexes and exorcism of evil spirits. An ''agimat'' also called a ''gayuma'' serves as a love [[Amulet|charm]] which makes the owner more attractive to the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Agimat and the Anting-Anting: Amulet and Talisman of the Philippinesn |url=http://www.amuletandtalisman.com/2012/08/the-agimat-and-anting-anting-amulet-and_8.html |accessdate=2012-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924001852/http://www.amuletandtalisman.com/2012/08/the-agimat-and-anting-anting-amulet-and_8.html |archivedate=2016-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although stereotyped as a cross, a flat, round or triangular golden pendant accompanying a necklace or a necklace-like item, it is also depicted as an enchanted stone that came from the sky or a fang left by a lightning strike (''pangil ng kidlat'') or even a drop of liquid from the heart of a banana tree at midnight (''mutya''). In relation to the latter, it is usually ingested. An ''agimat'' is usually accompanied by a small book of magic incantations which must be read during Good Friday or a certain special date to attain the amulet's full power and benefit. An ''agimat'' could also be in the form of a clothing with magic words inscribed on it, or even in the form of edible enchanted mud (''putik'' in Tagalog).&lt;ref name=Bakbakan&gt;[http://www.bakbakan.com/anting.html Galang, Reynaldo S. "Anting anting, the Filipino Warrior's Amulet"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730051548/http://www.bakbakan.com/anting.html |date=July 30, 2008 }}, Bakbakan International, Bakbakan.com (1994, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods of obtaining an ''agimat'' is by getting the liquid that is drained from an exhumed body of an unbaptized child or aborted fetus or offering food and drinks to the spirits in a cemetery during midnight of Holy Wednesday or Holy Thursday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ileto|first=Reynaldo Clemeña|title=Pasyon and revolution|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|date=1997|pages=22–23|isbn=978-971-550-232-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UuMthgJ1KH4C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=anting-anting#PPA22,M1|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the amulets bear Latin inscriptions into it. Like those in [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]] district in [[Manila]], most of the ''agimat'' merchants are near churches (like in its courtyard or in the marketplace just nearby). Filipino freedom fighters also wore ''anting-anting'' to battle against the Spaniards and the Americans. Filipino hero [[Macario Sakay]] wore a vest that has religious images and Latin phrases to protect him from bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/online/index.cfm?P=6382 |title=Reading 1 - Macario Sakay: Tulisán or Patriot? |last=Flores |first=Paul |date=1996 |publisher=The University of Auckland |accessdate=2008-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040711080349/http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/online/index.cfm?P=6382 |archivedate=July 11, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Philippine-[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], was given an ''anting-anting'' by [[Gregorio Aglipay]] that could supposedly make Marcos invisible.&lt;ref name="Karnow"&gt;[[Stanley Karnow|Karnow, Stanley]]. ''[[In Our Image: America’s Empire in the Philippines]]'', Ballantine Books, Random House, Inc., March 3, 1990, 536 pages, {{ISBN|0-345-32816-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcos said that the ''agimat'' is a sliver of wood that was inserted into his back before the [[Battle of Bataan|Bataan campaign]] on 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=David Joel|title=The Philippines: a singular and a plural place|publisher=Basic Books|date=2000|pages=89|isbn=978-0-8133-3755-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mf8YUky_mMC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=anting-anting|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earliest reports of ''anting-anting'' are from the records of Spanish priests in the early colonial period. [[Pardo de Tavera]] defines the ''anting-anting'' as "an amulet, of super natural power, that saves lives." With the Christianization of the Philippines, ''anting-anting'' appropriated the forms of the new religion, and incorporated as well the esoteric symbolisms of Freemasonry. An Islamic version of ''anting-anting'' exists in the Southern Muslim islands.&lt;ref name="Bakbakan"/&gt; In Filipino films, the wearer of the ''agimat'' gains superhuman strength, invisibility, heightened senses, self-healing, and elemental powers. With it, the person can also be able to shoot or fire lightning via hands, or generate electricity throughout one's body. The person can also perform telekinesis, stop a live bullet, can have premonitions, invisibility, flight, morphing abilities, camouflage abilities like a chameleon, can have extreme good luck, possess invincibility, or perform miracle curative powers. In his Filipino films, actor [[Ramon Revilla, Sr.]], as ''[[Nardong Putik]]'', was depicted to have protection from bullets and slash wounds, provided he eats a certain special mud.&lt;ref name=IMDB&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359735/ IMDB Information: ''Nardong Putik'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1396">[[File:Arabic maqam jins ajam.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Characteristic [[trichord]] of maqam ajam on B flat]] 
'''‘Ajam''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: '''Acem''') is the name of a [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] (musical mode) in [[Arabic music|Arabic]], [[Turkish music|Turkish]], and related systems of music. Ajam ('''عجم''') in this usage means "Persian."

The maqam Ajam is constructed of two Ajam trichords with "whole step-whole step" pitch intervals and spacing similar to the 1-2-3 (or 5-6-7) scale degrees found in an [[12 tone equal temperament|equal-tempered]] Western [[major scale]] (although the Ajam trichord's third scale degree may be tuned just slightly flat of an equal-tempered third).  Because most uses of these Ajam trichords place the next (fourth) scale step a halfstep above the last (third) scale step of the Ajam trichord, the result is essentially the same as the "whole step—whole step—half step" tetrachord construction of the Western major scale, and thus the maqam Ajam sounds generally the same as the major scale in Western music ({{audio|Diatonic scale on C.mid|Play}}).

On F (notated C in Turkish music), Ajam is known as ''Jaharkah'' (in Turkish: [[Çârgâh]], see also [[Chahargah (mode)]]).

==Overview==
The Bloc was co-founded by [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]],&lt;ref name=eohom&gt;[http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?&amp;I21DBN=EIU&amp;P21DBN=EIU&amp;S21STN=1&amp;S21REF=10&amp;S21FMT=eiu_all&amp;C21COM=S&amp;S21CNR=20&amp;S21P01=0&amp;S21P02=0&amp;S21P03=TRN=&amp;S21COLORTERMS=0&amp;S21STR=Blok_natsionalnykh Block of National Minorities]. Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine&lt;/ref&gt; a Polish-Jewish politician. It was formed on 17 August 1922 at a conference in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=eohom&gt;[http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?&amp;I21DBN=EIU&amp;P21DBN=EIU&amp;S21STN=1&amp;S21REF=10&amp;S21FMT=eiu_all&amp;C21COM=S&amp;S21CNR=20&amp;S21P01=0&amp;S21P02=0&amp;S21P03=TRN=&amp;S21COLORTERMS=0&amp;S21STR=Blok_natsionalnykh Block of National Minorities]. Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine&lt;/ref&gt; Its united electoral committee consisted of three representatives each from Belarusians, Jews, Germans and Ukrainians (except for natives of Eastern Galicia who boycotted the elections).&lt;ref name=eohom/&gt;

BMN took part in the [[Polish legislative election, 1922]], [[Polish legislative election, 1928]] and [[Polish legislative election, 1930]], doing very well in the 1922 elections (19.5% and the second largest party) and 1928 elections (14% and the third largest party). In 1922 the bloc received the most votes in Volhynia, Polesia, and Chelm lands.&lt;ref name=eohom/&gt; On its party list there were elected 66 sejm representatives and 22 senators.&lt;ref name=eohom/&gt; In 1928 the bloc consisted of the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance]] (UNDO), Ukrainian Peasant Union, Zionist organizations "Mizrahi" and "Hitachdut" (Unity) and few Belarusian and German groups.&lt;ref name=eohom/&gt; During the 1928 elections, the bloc earned 55 mandates to the Sejm and 21 to the Senate.&lt;ref name=eohom/&gt;

In 1930 elections which were considered not free, it fared poorly (3% and the ninth largest party). In the political shakedown following the 1930 elections, the Bloc was dissolved.

In the Second Polish Republic, ethnic minorities constituted 1/3 of total population.

'''Carving''' is the act of using [[tool]]s to shape something from a material by scraping away portions of that material. The technique can be applied to any material that is solid enough to hold a form even when pieces have been removed from it, and yet soft enough for portions to be scraped away with available tools. Carving, as a means for making [[sculpture]], is distinct from methods using soft and malleable materials like [[clay]], [[fruit]], and melted [[glass]], which may be shaped into the desired forms while soft and then harden into that form. Carving tends to require much more work than methods using malleable materials.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Marcus Mendelowitz, ''Children Are Artists: An Introduction to Children's Art for Teachers and Parents'' (1953), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinds of carving include:
* [[Bone carving]]
* [[Chip carving]]
* [[Fruit carving]]
* Gourd carving or [[gourd art]]
* Ice carving or [[ice sculpture]]
* [[Ivory carving]]
* [[Stone carving]]
** [[Petroglyph]]
* [[Vegetable carving]]
**[[Thaeng yuak]] (Banana stalk carving)
* [[Wood carving]]
* [[Hobo nickel]]
* Tree carving
** [[Arborglyph]]

Left to right Abstract / Bougouni / Southern region style, Vertical/ Segu/ Northern region style, the Horizontal / Bamako / Northern region style, and the Abstract / Sikasso region style.]]
[[File:Chiwara Chicago sculpture.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Two Chiwara at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. Female (left) and male Vertical styles.]]

A '''Chiwara''' (also '''Chi wara''', '''Ci Wara''', or '''Tyi Wara'''; {{lang-bm|ciwara}}; {{lang-fr|tchiwara}}) is a ritual object representing an [[antelope]], used by the [[Bambara people|Bambara]] ethnic group in [[Mali]]. The Chiwara initiation society uses Chiwara masks, as well as dances and rituals associated primarily with agriculture, to teach young Bamana men social values as well as agricultural techniques.

== Stylistic variations ==
Chiwara masks are categorized in three ways: [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]], [[vertical direction|vertical]], or abstract. In addition, Chiwara can be either male or female. Female Chiwara masks are denoted by the presence of a baby antelope and straight horns. Male Chiwara masks have bent horns and a [[phallus]]. The sex of a Chiwara mask is much clearer on horizontal and vertical masks while abstract masks tend to be difficult to classify.

The appearance of the Chiwara form varies greatly both by region and time produced. Specific master wood carvers also subtly modified the accepted (or even religiously mandated) local forms, forming a distinct "signature" or "school" of Chiwara figures.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Wardwell (November 1984) A Bambara Master Carver, ''African Arts'', '''18'''(1):pp83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;   These regional variations have been roughly assigned the stylistic categories above. Thus ''the [[Bougouni]] / Southern region style'' are an amalgam of several animal motifs combined in the same work, in an abstract style; ''the [[Bamako]] / Northern region style'' is usually of the horizontal style; ''the [[Ségou|Segu]]/ Northern region style'' (the heartland of the [[Bambara Empire]]) matches the vertical style with the unique "cut out" triangular body motif of the males. Other regional styles have been proposed, including ''the [[Sikasso]] region style'', with a thin, delicate, vertical form within almost human, snoutless face.&lt;ref&gt;See descriptions at  [http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/programmation/exhibitions/last-exhibitions/ciwara-african-chimeras/index.html Ciwara, African chimeras. Exhibition, Musée du quai Branly, Paris. 23 June – 17 December 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235258/http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/programmation/exhibitions/last-exhibitions/ciwara-african-chimeras/index.html |date=26 September 2007 }}. and see the galleries at [http://www.hamillgallery.com/BAMANA/BamanaChiWara/BamanaChiWara.html Hamill Gallery:Bamana Chi Wara].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonial usage==
In [[Bambara language|Bambara]], ''chi'' ''wara'' means ''laboring'' ''wild animal'',&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Salzhauer Axel, Nina Sobol Levent (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and is a representation of Bambara [[Mythology|mythos]] about the creation of farming.

=== Mousso Koroni ===
While there are several versions of the story, the discovery of agriculture is credited to the hero Chi Wara, a half antelope, half human figure born from the union of the sky goddess Mousso Koroni and an earth spirit in the shape of a cobra. The Chi Wara came to earth to teach humans to sow crops, and thus is honored at both sowing and harvest festivals.

=== The Chi Wara figure ===
The Chi Wara itself is usually represented as a [[Roan Antelope]] with an almost human face, but also takes shapes of other creatures and emblems of farming. The hero descends from the sky goddess, and thus represents the sun, its body is often elongated and short legged to represent the [[aardvark]] who burrows into the earth like a farmer. Its high horns echo the stalks of [[millet]], and it stands on a dancer clad in a mass of [[raffia]] stalks to represent both flowing water and a bountiful harvest. The zig-zag patterns echo the movement of the sun across the sky, and the penis of the male figure stands low to the ground, fertilizing the earth.
The Chi Wara figures always appear as a male/female pair, combining the elements of fertility of humans with fertility of the earth. The female figure usually carries a young antelope on her back, and is said to represent human beings carried by the Chi Wara hero, as well as a newborn human carried on a mother's back.

===''chi wara ton''===
As farmers of the upper [[Niger river]] [[savanna]], the blessing of agriculture is of central importance to Bambara society. These traditions survive in part because the Bambara were one of the last cultures in the area to embrace [[Islam]], after the fall of the [[Bambara Empire]] in the late 19th century.
Bambara culture has traditionally had a strict set of age and caste cofraternities (''ton''/''jo''/''jow''), and the ''chi wara ton'' society is one of the more important. It gathers all young adult males of the ''Soli'' age group to work the fields at clearing, sowing and harvest, when the greatest number of laborers is needed. Secret teachings of the ''chi wara ton'' pass the needed skills for this work, upon which the very survival of the community depends.

The ''chi wara ton'' is also the only major Bambara society which includes both sexes. Women's labor is needed for agriculture, just as both sexes are needed for human reproduction.

=== Dance ===
The Chi Wara is always danced with each wooden figure attached to a basket on the dancer's head, and the body covered in a huge pile of raffia. Often the face is obscured with raffia that has been colored or decorated, and the dancer carries a long staff. The figures are always in one or more male/female pairs, with the female usually dancing behind the male, fanning him and spreading his powers into the gathered community. The Male figures leap to represent the antelope, and then scratch the earth with their staves or horns as the Chi Wara teaches humans to cultivate crops. In some communities the Mousso Koroni figure also appears. Initiated children wear a "Sogono Kuni" ("Little antelope head"), which is quite rare to find in museums. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/chiwara.htm princetonol.com: Chi Wara Headdress of the Bamana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024353/http://www.princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/chiwara.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}.

== World influence ==
African sculptural forms became fashionable amongst European artists and collectors at the beginning of the Twentieth century, and the Chiwara, especially in its more abstract forms, became one of the icons of what Europeans called ''Primitive Art''. The artist [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and collector [[Paul Guillaume]] published images of the Chiwara in their ''Sculptures nègres'' in 1917, while [[Picasso]], [[Braque]], and [[Les Fauves]] became fascinated with African sculpture and masks in general, and the Chiwara figure in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of French studies of African sculpture among the artists, critics, and collectors of Modern Art include: ''À propos d'art nègre'' by Guillaume Apollinaire; ''Opinions sur l'art nègre'' with contributions by Braque, [[Matisse]], and Picasso; ''Rencontre avec l'art nègre'' by [[Jean Laude]]; ''La Sculpture nègre et l'art moderne'' by Paul Guillaume; and  ''L'art nègre'' by [[Henri Clouzot]] and [[André Level]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A vertical, male, semi-abstracted Chiwara figure was included in the 1935 [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] exhibit ''African Negro Art'', and the ''Masterpieces of African Art'' at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in 1954, (as well as shows in London&lt;ref&gt;The Sculptor [[Henry Moore]] singles out the Chiwara in a review of a 1951 London show.

{{More footnotes|date=February 2015}}
In modern [[literary criticism]], in particular of [[genre fiction]], '''conceit''' frequently means an extended [[rhetorical device]], summed up in a short phrase, that refers to a situation which either does not exist or exists very infrequently but which is necessary to the plot. "Faster than light travel" and "superior alien science" are examples from [[science fiction]]; the "hardboiled private gumshoe" is an example from [[detective stories]].

The word conceit was originally coined in the context of [[poetry]], deriving from the root ''concept, conceive''. It has subsequently been extended to other forms of literature, the [[performing arts]], [[painting]], [[photography]], and even [[architecture]].

== Use as praise versus criticism ==

The term '''conceit''' can be used positively or derogatorily.

* In the positive sense, a conceit originally referred to an [[extended metaphor]] with a complex [[logic]] that governs a poetic passage or entire [[poem]]. By juxtaposing, [[:wikt:usurp|usurping]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulating]] images and ideas in surprising ways, a conceit invites the reader into a more sophisticated understanding of an object of comparison. Conceits in English are part of the poetic idiom of [[Mannerism]], during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century. This has been extended to describe presentation of any material whose creator uses one or more techniques to effectively induce a desired effect on the reader or viewer, such as setting a mood. In movie-making, examples include deliberately filming in black and white, emphasizing shadows, using panoramic views or employing extended zoom for a scene.
* In a derogatory sense, "conceit" refers to an excessively elaborate, contrived or unconvincing approach to the material being presented, such as a fundamentally flawed idea, preposterous plot device, or pretentious dialog or phrasing. Again, this was originally applied to poetry that someone disliked, and the areas of application later broadened. An example of derogatory use is in the title of economist [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s book, "The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism" &lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Hayek. The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism.. https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0226321150&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern writing (e.g., reviews of movies or books, or descriptions of others' inventions or ideas), the word "conceit", when used by itself without preceding adjectives (such as "brilliant" or "unpersuasive"), tends to be used more often as criticism than as praise. Such use is especially common when writing for a broad audience rather than specialists in poetry or literary criticism. Which sense is actually intended, however, must be inferred from the overall content and tone of the passage containing the phrase.

== In poetry ==
===Metaphysical===
[[File:Jonquil Masquerade.jpg|thumb|The flowers are beginning their masquerade as people. [[Narcissus jonquilla|Sir Jonquil]] begins the fun. ([[Walter Crane]], 1899)]]
In [[English literature]] the term is generally associated with the 17th century [[metaphysical poets]], an extension of contemporary usage. The [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] conceit differs from an extended analogy in the sense that it does not have a clear-cut relationship between the things being compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Cushman|author2=Clare Cavanagh|author3=Jahan Ramazani|author4=Paul Rouzer|title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics: Fourth Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKiC6IeFR2UC&amp;pg=PA290|date=26 August 2012|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=1-4008-4142-9|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Gardner (critic)|Helen Gardner]]&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner (1961) ''The Metaphysical Poets'' ([[Oxford University Press]]) "Introduction" p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; observed that "a conceit is a comparison whose ingenuity is more striking than its justness" and that "a comparison becomes a conceit when we are made to concede likeness while being strongly conscious of unlikeness." An example of the latter occurs in [[John Donne]]'s "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning", in which a couple faced with absence from each other is likened to a compass.

&lt;poem&gt;
Dull sublunary lovers' love
   (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit
Absence, because it doth remove
   Those things which elemented it.

But we by a love so much refined,
   That our selves know not what it is,
Inter-assured of the mind,
   Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.

Our two souls therefore, which are one,
   Though I must go, endure not yet
A breach, but an expansion,
   Like gold to airy thinness beat.

If they be two, they are two so
   As stiff twin compasses are two;
Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show
   To move, but doth, if the other do.

And though it in the center sit,
   Yet when the other far doth roam,
It leans and hearkens after it,
   And grows erect, as that comes home.

Such wilt thou be to me, who must,
   Like th' other foot, obliquely run;
Thy firmness makes my circle just,
   And makes me end where I begun. &lt;/poem&gt;

The metaphysical conceit is often imaginative, exploring specific parts of an experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert H. Ray|title=An Andrew Marvell Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_buTeQdwnKsC&amp;pg=PA106|year=1998|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=978-0-8240-6248-4|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Donne]]'s "[[s:The Flea|''The Flea'']]" is a poem seemingly about fleas in a bed. When [[Philip Sydney|Sir Philip Sidney]] begins a [[sonnet]] with the conventional idiomatic expression "My true-love hath my heart and I have his",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/truelove.htm |title=Sir Philip Sidney. "My true love hath my heart, and I have his." Love sonnet from "Arcadia." |publisher=Luminarium.org |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; he takes the metaphor literally and teases out a number of literal possibilities in the exchange of hearts. The result is a fully formed conceit.

===Petrarchan===
The [[Petrarch]]an conceit is a form of love poetry wherein a man's love interest is referred to in [[hyperbole]]. For instance, the lover is a ship on a stormy sea, and his mistress is either "a cloud of dark disdain" or the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Najat Ismaeel Sayakhan|title=THE TEACHING PROBLEMS OF ENGLISH POETRY IN THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENTS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhlBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|date=8 July 2014|publisher=[[Author House]]|isbn=978-1-4969-8399-2|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paradoxical pain and pleasure of lovesickness is often described using [[oxymoron]], for instance uniting peace and war, burning and freezing, and so forth. But images which were novel in the sonnets of [[Petrarch]], in his innovative exploration of human feelings, became clichés in the poetry of later imitators. Romeo uses hackneyed Petrarchan conceits when describing his love for Rosaline as "bright smoke, cold fire, sick health".

== Etymology ==
In the [[Renaissance]], the term (which is related to the word [[concept]]) indicated any particularly fanciful expression of [[wit]], and was later used pejoratively of outlandish poetic metaphors.

Recent [[literary criticism|literary critics]] have used the term to mean simply the style of extended and heightened metaphor common in the Renaissance and particularly in the 17th century, without any particular indication of value. Within this critical sense, the Princeton Encyclopedia makes a distinction between two kinds of conceits: the Metaphysical conceit, described above, and the [[Petrarch]]an conceit. In the latter, human experiences are described in terms of an outsized metaphor (a kind of metaphorical [[hyperbole]]), like the stock comparison of eyes to the sun, which [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] makes light of in his [[Sonnet 130]]: "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun."

A '''counterword''' (also spelled '''counter word''' and '''counter-word''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordsmyth.net/?level=3&amp;ent=counterword+|title=Wordsmyth Dictionary|website=wordsmyth.net}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/counterword?r=66|title=the definition of counterword|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a word such as ''"so"'' that is frequently used to answer ("counter") in a reflex-like manner and that has due to this frequent use quickly taken on a new, much less specific or much looser meaning or is even almost meaningless or performs a completely new function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/counterword|title=Meaning of counterword |website=InfoPlease}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/counterword|title=Counterword definition and meaning |website=Collins English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "so", for example, is frequently used to begin an answer in the sense of "Well,..." or to function as an indirect way of saying "Before answering that, I'd like to..." or even instead of saying "On the contrary,..." or "No, I...".

In a more general sense, the term is used for such words also when they are not used as a reflex-like answer and even for any widely used words that (due to a similar change) now have a broad and vague range of meanings in many very different situations (e.g. case, awfully, fix, job, payoff).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.word.com/idictionary/counterword+|title=Definition of COUNTERWORD|website=i.word.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since such change due to very frequent use occurs much more rapidly than the change in meaning all words go through, and since such words are even sometimes still simultaneously used in their original sense, the new usage is often considered incorrect by some speakers. Other examples include ''nice'', ''terrific'', ''terrible'', ''awful'', ''tremendous'', ''swell'', ''hopefully'' and ''very fine'' (degrading the meaning of ''fine'' to "OK").

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' does not support this and defines counter-word as "countersign", noting that its usage is military and obsolete with a single quotation from 1678.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/43064?redirectedFrom=counterword#eid "counter-word"], ''Oxford English Dictionary''.

A '''cultural universal''' (also called an '''anthropological universal''' or '''human universal'''), as discussed by [[Emile Durkheim]], [[George Murdock]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]] and others, is an element, pattern, trait, or institution that is common to all [[human culture]]s worldwide. Taken together, the whole body of cultural universals is known as the [[human condition]]. [[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations.&lt;ref name="Psychology"&gt;Schacter, Daniel L, Daniel Wegner and Daniel Gilbert. 2007. ''Psychology''. Worth Publishers. pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Some anthropological and sociological theorists that take a [[cultural relativist]] perspective may deny the existence of cultural universals: the extent to which these universals are "cultural" in the narrow sense, or in fact biologically inherited [[ethology|behavior]] is an issue of "[[nature versus nurture]]".

==General==
The emergence of these universals dates to the [[Upper Paleolithic]], with the first evidence of full [[behavioral modernity]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Bold claim, no source...|date=July 2018}}

==Non-nativist explanations==
The observation of the same or similar behavior in different cultures does not prove that they are the results of a common underlying psychological mechanism. One possibility is that they may have been invented independently due to a common practical problem.&lt;ref&gt;Language: The cultural tool DL Everett - 2012 - Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;

Since any cultures that have been [[anthropology|studied by anthropologists]] have had contact with at least the anthropologists that studied it, and anthropological [[research ethics]] slows the studies down so that other groups unbound by such ethics, often at least locally represented by people of the same skin color as the supposedly isolated tribe but significantly culturally globalized, reach the tribe before the anthropologists do, no truly uncontacted culture has ever been scientifically studied.&lt;ref&gt;Fam Med. 2008 Jan;40(1) Continuing professional development in sensitive cultures. Huntington MK1.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows outside influence to be an explanation for cultural universals as well.&lt;ref&gt;Equal Recognition: The Moral Foundations of Minority Rights, Alan Patten 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This does not preclude multiple independent inventions of [[civilization]] and is therefore not the same thing as [[hyperdiffusionism]], it merely means that cultural universals are not proof of [[innateness]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultures and Globalization: Cultural Expression, Creativity and Innovation, Helmut K Anheier, Yudhishthir Raj Isar 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication bias in population level universals==
Anthropology's application of one ordinary evidence standard for data that agrees with its theories of cultural universals and one extraordinary standard of evidence for data that disagree with it raises issues with population level [[publication bias]]. While it is possible with strong enough evidence for the validity of one case study that disagree to pass [[peer review]], those that agree will statistically do so more often than those that disagree even if the level of evidence is the same. Since multiple field studies regarding the same culture are combined when statistical prevalences of behaviors are assessed, the result may cause appearances of behaviors having a supposedly universal statistical demographic even if it does not. Some anthropologists suggest that this may give an appearance of statistics such as more men than women hunting large prey being universal without actually being universal, for example that field studies in which more men than women hunted passed peer review while field studies for the same culture in which the genders were equal or inverted for hunting were not published. &lt;ref&gt;"Epidemiology and Culture: Anthropology, Anthropology", CTI Reviews, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Evaluating Scientific Research: Separating Fact from Fiction", Fred Leavitt, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian philosophy==
{{Main|Indian philosophy}}
{{Further|Hinduism|Hindu philosophy}}
[[Indian philosophy]] refers to [[Ancient India|ancient]] philosophical traditions ({{lang-sa|{{IAST|dárśana}}}}; 'world views', 'teachings')&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=darzana&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 Spoken Sanskrit, ''darzana'']&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

In: Joseph Kitagawa, "The Religious Traditions of Asia: Religion, History, and Culture", Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu thought also spread east to the Indonesian [[Srivijaya empire]] and the Cambodian [[Khmer Empire]]. These religio-philosophical traditions were later grouped under the label [[Hinduism]]. Hinduism is the dominant religion, or way of life,{{refn|group=note|name="definition"|Hinduism is variously defined as a "religion", "set of religious beliefs and practices", "religious tradition", "a way of life" ({{sfn|Sharma|2003|pp=12–13}}) etc. For a discussion on the topic, see: "Establishing the boundaries" in {{sfn|Flood|2008|pp=1–17}}}} in [[South Asia]]. It includes [[Shaivism]], [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaktism]]{{sfn|Nath|2001|p=31}} among numerous [[Hindu denominations|other traditions]], and a wide spectrum of [[Dharmaśāstra|laws and prescriptions]] of "daily morality" based on [[karma]], [[dharma]], and societal norms.

Some of the earliest surviving philosophical texts are the [[Upanishads]] of the [[Vedic period#Later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE)|later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE)]]. Important Indian philosophical concepts include [[dharma]], [[karma]], [[samsara]], [[moksha]] and [[ahimsa]]. Indian philosophers developed a system of epistemological reasoning ([[pramana]]) and logic and investigated topics such as [[Ontology]] ([[metaphysics]], [[Brahman]]-[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], [[Sunyata]]-[[Anatta]]), reliable means of knowledge ([[epistemology]], [[Pramana]]s), value system ([[axiology]]) and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy W.

The [[Tirukkural|Kural literature]] of c. 1st century BCE, written by the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poet-philosopher [[Valluvar]], is believed by many scholars to be based on [[Jain]] philosophies.{{sfn|Mohan Lal|1992|pp=4333–4334}}{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=156-171}}

Later developments include the development of [[Tantra]] and Iranian-Islamic influences. Buddhism mostly disappeared from India after the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]], surviving in the Himalayan regions and south India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Randall Collins|title=he Sociology of Philosophies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2HS1DOZ35EgC |year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02977-4 |pages=184–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early modern period saw the flourishing of [[Navya-Nyāya]] (the 'new reason') under philosophers such as [[Raghunatha Siromani]] (c. 1460–1540) who founded the tradition, [[Jayarama Pancanana]], [[Mahadeva Punatamakara]] and [[Yashovijaya]] (who formulated a Jain response).&lt;ref&gt;Ganeri, Jonardon. ''The Lost Age of Reason Philosophy In Early Modern India 1450–1700'', Oxford U. press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodox schools===
The principal Indian philosophical schools are classified as either orthodox or heterodox – [[Āstika and nāstika|āstika or nāstika]] – depending on one of three alternate criteria: whether it believes the [[Vedas]] are a valid source of knowledge; whether the school believes in the premises of [[Brahman]] and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]; and whether the school believes in afterlife and [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]].&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger |title=On Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8vRAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-936008-6|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six major schools of orthodox Indian [[Hindu philosophy]]—[[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]] and [[Vedanta]], and five major heterodox schools—[[Jainism|Jain]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Ajivika]], [[Ajñana]], and [[Cārvāka]]. However, there are other methods of classification; [[Vidyaranya]] for instance identifies sixteen schools of Hindu Indian philosophy by including those that belong to the [[Shaivism|Śaiva]] and [[Raseśvara]] traditions.&lt;ref name="cowell"&gt;Cowell, E.B.; Gough, A.E. (1882). Sarva-Darsana Sangraha of Madhava Acharya: Review of Different Systems of Hindu Philosophy. New Delhi: Indian Books Centre/Sri Satguru Publications. {{ISBN|81-703-0875-5}}, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nicholson"&gt;Nicholson, pp. 158-162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each school of Hindu philosophy has extensive [[Epistemology|epistemological]] literature called ''[[Pramana]]-sastras''.&lt;ref name=kp&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}, pages 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbil&gt;[[Purushottama Bilimoria|P Bilimoria]] (1993), Pramāṇa epistemology: Some recent developments, in Asian philosophy - Volume 7 (Editor: G Floistad), Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-5107-1}}, pages 137-154&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[History of Hinduism|Hindu history]], the distinction of the six orthodox schools was current in the [[Gupta period]] "golden age" of Hinduism. With the disappearance of Vaisheshika and Mīmāṃsā, it became obsolete by the later Middle Ages, when the various sub-schools of Vedanta ([[Dvaita]] "dualism", Advaita Vedanta "non-dualism" and others) began to rise to prominence as the main divisions of religious philosophy. Nyaya survived into the 17th century as ''Navya Nyaya'' "Neo-Nyaya", while Samkhya gradually lost its status as an independent school, its tenets absorbed into Yoga and Vedanta.

====Sāmkhya and Yoga====
[[File:Amsuman and Kapila.jpg|thumb|x216px|King Amsuman and the yogic sage [[Kapila]]. The [[Samkhya]] school traditionally traces itself back to sage Kapila.]]
[[Samkhya|Sāmkhya]] is a [[Mind–body dualism|dualist]] philosophical tradition based on the [[Samkhyakarika]] (circa 320-540 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, pages 146-147&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga school]] was a closely related tradition emphasizing [[Dhyana in Hinduism|meditation]] and [[Kaivalya|liberation]] whose major text is the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga sutras]] (c. 400 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Maas, Philipp A. (2006). ''Samādhipāda: das erste Kapitel des Pātañjalayogaśāstra zum ersten Mal kritisch ediert''. Aachen: Shaker. {{ISBN|3832249877}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of proto-Samkhya ideas can however be traced back all the way to the period of the early [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref&gt;GJ Larson, RS Bhattacharya and K Potter (2014), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691604411}}, pages 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main differences between the two closely related schools was that Yoga allowed for the existence of a God, while most [[Samkhya|Sāmkhya]] thinkers criticized this idea.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Perrett (2007), Samkhya-Yoga Ethics, Indian Ethics: Classical Traditions and Contemporary Challenges (Editors: Purusottama Bilimoria et al), Volume 1, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3301-3}}, page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Sāmkhya [[epistemology]] accepts three of six [[pramana]]s (proofs) as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge; ''pratyakṣa'' ([[perception]]), ''anumāṇa'' ([[inference]]) and ''śabda'' (word/testimony of reliable sources).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; The school developed a complex theoretical exposition of the evolution of [[Purusha|consciousness]] and [[Prakṛti|matter]]. Sāmkhya sources argue that the universe consists of two realities, [[Purusha|puruṣa]] ([[consciousness]]) and [[prakṛti]] ([[matter]]).

As shown by the ''[[Samkhyapravachana Sutra|Sāṁkhyapravacana Sūtra]]'' (c. 14th century CE), Sāmkhya continued to develop throughout the medieval period.

====Nyāya====
[[Nyaya|The Nyāya]] school of [[epistemology]], explores [[Pramāṇa|sources of knowledge]] (''Pramāṇa'') and is based on the ''[[Nyāya Sūtras]]'' (circa 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE).&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723943}}, page 129&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nyaya|Nyāya]] holds that human suffering arises out of ignorance and liberation arises through correct knowledge. Therefore, they sought to investigate the sources of correct knowledge or epistemology.

[[Nyaya|Nyāya]] traditionally accepts four ''[[Pramana]]s'' as reliable means of gaining knowledge – ''Pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''Anumāṇa'' (inference), ''Upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy) and ''Śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Nyaya|Nyāya]] also traditionally defended a form of philosophical [[Realism (philosophical)|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman (2006), Nyaya, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, pages 405-407&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Nyāya Sūtras]]'' was a very influential text in Indian philosophy, laying the foundations for classical Indian epistemological debates between the different philosophical schools. It includes, for example, the classic Hindu rejoinders against Buddhist not-self ([[anatta]]) arguments.&lt;ref&gt;P Bilimoria and JN Mohanty (2003), Relativism, Suffering and Beyond, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195662078}}, pages i–ix with Introduction and Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; The work also famously argues against a creator God ([[Ishvara]]),&lt;ref&gt;John Clayton (2010), Religions, Reasons and Gods: Essays in Cross-cultural Philosophy of Religion, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521126274}}, page 150&lt;/ref&gt; a debate which became central to Hinduism in the medieval period.

====Vaiśeṣika====
[[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]] is a naturalist school of [[atomism]], which accepts only two sources of knowledge, perception and inference.&lt;ref&gt;DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 172&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy held that the universe was reducible to ''paramāṇu'' ([[atom]]s), which are indestructible (''anitya''), indivisible, and have a special kind of dimension, called “small” (''aṇu''). Whatever we experience is a composite of these atoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/early-modern-india/#VaiAto Analytical philosophy in early modern India] J Ganeri, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaiśeṣika organized all objects of experience into what they called ''padārtha''s (literally: 'the meaning of a word') which included six categories; ''dravya'' (substance), ''guṇa'' (quality), ''karma'' (activity), ''sāmānya'' (generality), ''viśeṣa'' (particularity) and ''samavāya'' (inherence). Later ''Vaiśeṣika''s (''Śrīdhara'' and Udayana and ''Śivāditya'') added one more category ''[[abhava]]'' (non-existence). The first three categories are defined as ''artha'' (which can perceived) and they have real objective existence. The last three categories are defined as ''budhyapekṣam'' (product of intellectual discrimination) and they are logical categories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vaisheshika#CITEREFRadhakrishnan2006|Radhakrishnan 2006]], pp. 183–86&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mīmāṃsā====
[[Mīmāṃsā]] is a school of ritual [[orthopraxy]] and is known for its [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] study and interpretation of the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name="Oliver Leaman 2006"&gt;Oliver Leaman (2006), Shruti, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, page 503&lt;/ref&gt; For this tradition, the study of ''[[dharma]]'' as rituals and social duties was paramount. They also held that the Vedas were "eternal, authorless, [and] infallible" and that Vedic injunctions and [[mantra]]s in rituals are prescriptive actions of primary importance.&lt;ref name="Oliver Leaman 2006"/&gt; Because of their focus on textual study and interpretation, Mīmāṃsā also developed theories of [[philology]] and the [[philosophy of language]] which influenced other Indian schools.&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Scharf, ''The Denotation of Generic Terms in Ancient Indian Philosophy'' (1996), Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; They primarily held that the purpose of language was to clearly ''prescribe'' proper actions, rituals and correct [[dharma]] (duty or virtue).&lt;ref&gt;Chris Bartley (2013), Purva Mimamsa, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'' (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, 978-0415862530, page 443-445&lt;/ref&gt; Mīmāṃsā is also mainly atheistic, holding that the evidence for the existence of God is insufficient and that the Gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the names, mantras and their power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward|Coward, Harold]] (2008-02-07). [https://books.google.com/books?id=LkE_8uch5P0C ''The perfectibility of human nature in eastern and western thought'']. p. 114. {{ISBN|9780791473368}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key text of the Mīmāṃsā school is the [[Purva Mimamsa Sutras|Mīmāṃsā Sūtra]] of [[Jaimini]] and major Mīmāṃsā cholars include [[Prabhākara]] (c. 7th century) and [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] roughly 700). The Mīmāṃsā school strongly influenced [[Vedanta|Vedānta]] which was also known as ''Uttara-Mīmāṃsā,'' however while Mīmāṃsā emphasized ''karmakāṇḍa'', or the study of ritual actions, using the four early [[Vedas]], the Vedānta schools emphasized ''jñanakāṇḍa'', the study of knowledge, using the later parts of Vedas like the [[Upaniṣads]].&lt;ref name="Oliver Leaman 2006"/&gt;

====Vedānta====
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|right|x216px|[[Adi Shankara]] (8th century CE) the main exponent of [[Advaita]] Vedānta]]
[[Vedānta]] (meaning "end of the [[Vedas]]") or ''Uttara-Mīmāṃsā'', are a group of traditions which focus on the philosophical issues found in the [[Prasthanatrayi]] (the three sources), which are the ''[[Principal Upanishads]]'', the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'' and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]].''&lt;ref&gt;[[Vedanta#CITEREFRanganathan|Ranganathan]]; [[Vedanta#CITEREFHiriyanna1948|Hiriyanna 1948]], pp. 19,21–25,150–152; [[Vedanta#CITEREFGrimes1990|Grimes 1990]], pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vedānta]] sees the Vedas, particularly the [[Upanishads]], as a reliable source of knowledge.

The central concern for these schools is the nature of and relationship between ''[[Brahman]] (''ultimate reality, universal consciousness''),'' ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] (''individual soul'')'' and ''[[Prakriti]]'' (empirical world)''.''

The sub-traditions of [[Vedānta]] include [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] (non-dualism), [[Vishishtadvaita]] (qualified non-dualism), [[Dvaita]] (dualism) and [[Bhedabheda]] (difference and non-difference).&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/Colloquium03%E2%80%93DiffVedantas.pdf Prem Pahlajrai, Asian Languages and Literature, University of Washington, ''Vedanta: A Comparative Analysis of Diverse Schools'']{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due the popularity of the [[bhakti movement]], [[Vedānta]] came to be the dominant current of [[Hinduism]] in the post-medieval period.

====Other====
While the classical enumeration of Indian philosophies lists six orthodox schools, there are other schools which are sometimes seen as orthodox. These include:&lt;ref name="cowell"/&gt;

* [[Pasupata|Paśupata]], an [[Asceticism|ascetic]] school of Shaivism founded by [[Lakulisha]] (~2nd century CE).
* [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Śaiva Siddhānta]], a school of dualistic [[Shaivism]] which was strongly influenced by Samkhya.
* [[Pratyabhijna|Pratyabhijña]] (recognition) school of [[Utpaladeva]] (10th century) and [[Abhinavagupta]] (975–1025 CE), a form of non-dual Shaiva [[tantra]].
* [[Raseśvara]], the mercurial school
* [[Pāṇini]] Darśana, the grammarian school (which clarifies the theory of [[Sphoṭa]])

===Heterodox or Śramaṇic schools===
{{Main|Śramaṇa}}
The nāstika or heterodox schools are associated with the non-vedic [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇic]] traditions that existed in India since before the 6th century BCE.&lt;ref name="reginaldray247"&gt;Reginald Ray (1999), Buddhist Saints in India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195134834}}, pages 237-240, 247-249&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇa movement]] gave rise to diverse range of non-vedic ideas, ranging from accepting or denying the concepts of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]], atomism, materialism, atheism, agnosticism, fatalism to free will, extreme asceticism, strict [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) and [[vegetarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Padmanabh S Jaini (2001), Collected papers on Buddhist Studies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120817760}}, pages 57-77&lt;/ref&gt; Notable philosophies that arose from [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇic]] movement were [[Jainism]], [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism|early Buddhism]], [[Cārvāka]], [[Ajñana]] and [[Ājīvika]].&lt;ref&gt;AL Basham (1951), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas - a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812048}}, pages 94-103&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jain philosophy====
[[Jain philosophy]] deals extensively with the problems of [[metaphysics]], [[reality]], [[cosmology]], [[ontology]], [[epistemology]] and [[divinity]]. [[Jainism]] is essentially a [[transtheistic]] religion of ancient India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Zimmer | first =Heinrich | editor =Joseph Campbell | title =Philosophies of India | publisher =Princeton University Press | year =1969 | location =New York | isbn =0-691-01758-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|182}} It continues the ancient [[Sramana|{{IAST|Śramaṇa}}]] tradition, which co-existed with the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic tradition]] since ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sangave | first =Dr. Vilas A. | title =Facets of Jainology: Selected Research Papers on Jain Society, Religion, and Culture | publisher =Popular Prakashan | year =2001 | location =Mumbai | isbn =81-7154-839-3 }}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Oldmeadow | first =Harry |authorlink =Harry Oldmeadow | title =Light from the East: Eastern Wisdom for the Modern West | publisher =World Wisdom Inc | year =2007 | location =Indiana | isbn =1-933316-22-5 }},p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The distinguishing features of Jain philosophy includes a [[Mind–body dualism|mind-body dualism]], denial of a [[Creator god|creative]] and [[omnipotent]] God, [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], an [[Jainism and non-creationism|eternal and uncreated universe]], [[Ahimsa in Jainism|non-violence]], the theory of the [[Anekantavada|multiple facets of truth]], and a morality based on [[Moksa (Jainism)|liberation]] of the soul. Jain philosophy attempts to explain the rationale of being and existence, the nature of the Universe and its constituents, the nature of bondage and the means to achieve liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Warren  | first =Herbert  | title =Jainism  | publisher =Crest Publishing House  | year =2001  | location =Delhi  | url =http://www.ibiblio.org/jainism/database/BOOK/hwarren.doc  | isbn =81-242-0037-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has often been described as an [[Asceticism|ascetic]] movement for its strong emphasis on self-control, austerities and renunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Brodd  | first =Jeffery  |author2=Gregory Sobolewski  | title =World Religions: A Voyage of Discovery   | publisher =Saint Mary's Press  | year =2003  | isbn =0-88489-725-7 }} pp.95-96&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been called a model of philosophical [[liberalism]] for its insistence that truth is relative and multifaceted and for its willingness to accommodate all possible view-points of the rival philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Mohanty  | first =Jitendranath   | title =Classical Indian Philosophy  | publisher =Rowman &amp; Littlefield  | year =2000  | location =Lanham  | isbn =0-8476-8933-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jainism strongly upholds the individualistic nature of [[soul]] and personal responsibility for one's decisions; and that self-reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for one's liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Carrithers  | first =Michael  | title =Naked Ascetics in Southern Digambar Jainism  | journal =Man, New Series  | volume =24  | issue =2  | pages =219–235  | publisher =Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland  | location =UK  |date=June 1989  | jstor =2803303}}p.220&lt;/ref&gt;

The contribution of the Jains in the development of Indian philosophy has been significant. Jain philosophical concepts like [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]], [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksa]], [[Samsara (Jainism)|Samsara]] and the like are common with other [[Indian religions]] like [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] in various forms.&lt;ref name="Zydenbos"&gt;{{cite book | last =Zydenbos | first =Robert J. | authorlink =Robert_J._Zydenbos | title =Jainism Today and Its Future | publisher =Manya Verlag | year =2006 | location =München | url =http://www.manyaverlag.de/jtaif.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Jainism traces its philosophy from teachings of [[Mahavira]] and other [[Tirthankara]]s, various Jain philosophers from [[Kundakunda]] and [[Umasvati]] in ancient times to [[Yashovijaya|Yasovijaya]] and [[Shrimad Rajchandra]] in recent times have contributed to Indian philosophical discourse in uniquely Jain ways.

====Cārvāka====
[[Charvaka|Cārvāka]] or Lokāyata was an [[Atheism|atheistic]] philosophy of [[Philosophical skepticism|scepticism]] and [[materialism]], who rejected the [[Vedas]] and all associated supernatural doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;KN Tiwari (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816077}}, page 67;&lt;/ref&gt; Cārvāka philosophers like Brihaspati were extremely critical of other schools of philosophy of the time. Cārvāka deemed the Vedas to be tainted by the three faults of untruth, self-contradiction, and tautology.&lt;ref name="page4"&gt;Cowell, E.B.; Gough, A.E. (1882). Sarva-Darsana Sangraha of Madhava Acharya: Review of Different Systems of Hindu Philosophy. New Delhi: Indian Books Centre/Sri Satguru Publications. {{ISBN|81-703-0875-5}}, p. xii., p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; They declared the Vedas to be incoherent rhapsodies invented by man whose only usefulness was to provide livelihood to priests.&lt;ref&gt;Original Sanskrit version:[https://archive.org/stream/Sarva-Darsana-Samgraha.by.Madhavacharya-Vidyaranya.Hindi#page/n11/mode/2up Sarva-darsana-sangraha], pages 3-7; English version: [https://archive.org/stream/thesarvadarsanas00madhuoft#page/4/mode/2up The Charvaka System] with commentary by Madhava Acharya, Translators: Cowell and Gough (1882), pages 5-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise they faulted Buddhists and Jains, mocking the concept of [[Nirvana|liberation]], [[reincarnation]] and accumulation of [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] or demerit through karma.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, Ramkrishna. [http://www.carvaka4india.com/2011/08/materialism-in-india-synoptic-view.html Materialism in India: A Synoptic View].

====Ājīvika====
[[Ājīvika]] was founded by [[Makkhali Gosala]], it was a [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇa movement]] and a major rival of [[early Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey D Long (2009), Jainism: An Introduction, Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-1845116255}}, page 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Original scriptures of the Ājīvika school of philosophy may once have existed, but these are currently unavailable and probably lost. Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ajivikas in the secondary sources of ancient Hindu Indian literature, particularly those of Jainism and Buddhism which polemically criticized the Ajivikas.&lt;ref name="Basham, A.L. 1951"&gt;Basham, A.L. (1951). History and Doctrines of the Ājīvikas (2nd ed.). Chapter 1.

====Ajñana====
[[Ajñana]] was a Śramaṇa school of radical Indian skepticism and a rival of early Buddhism and Jainism. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions;&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K.N. (1963). Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge (PDF) (1st ed.). London: George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd. p. 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation. They were seen as sophists who specialized in refutation without propagating any positive doctrine of their own. [[Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa]] (fl. c. 800), author of the skeptical work entitled ''Tattvopaplavasiṃha'' ("The Lion that Devours All Categories"/"The Upsetting of All Principles"), has been seen as an important Ajñana philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Salunkhe, AH (2009). Astikshiromani Charvaka (in Marathi). Satara: Lokayat Prakashan. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikh philosophy===
{{Main|Sikh religious philosophy}}
[[Sikhism]] is an Indian religion developed by [[Guru Nanak]] (1469–1539) in the [[Punjab (region)|Punjab region]] during the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Era]]. Their main sacred text is the ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]].'' The fundamental beliefs include constant spiritual meditation of [[God in Sikhism|God]]'s name, being guided by the Guru instead of yielding to capriciousness, living a householder's life instead of monasticism, truthful action to dharam (righteousness, moral duty), equality of all human beings, and believing in God's grace.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind-pal Singh Mandair (2014).

===Modern Indian philosophy===
[[File:Swami_Vivekananda_at_Parliament_of_Religions.jpg|thumb|From left to right: [[Virchand Gandhi]], [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], [[Swami Vivekananda]], (possibly) [[G. Bonet Maury]]. [[Parliament of the World's Religions|Parliament of World Religions]], 1893]]
In response to [[colonialism]] and their contact with [[Western philosophy]], 19th century Indians developed new ways of thinking now termed [[Neo-Vedanta]] and Hindu modernism. Their ideas focused on the universality of Indian philosophy (particularly Vedanta) and the unity of different religions. It was during this period that Hindu modernists presented a single idealized and united "[[Hinduism]]." exemplified by the philosophy of [[Advaita Vedanta]].&lt;ref&gt;Yelle, Robert A. (2012), "Comparative Religion as Cultural Combat: Occidentalism and Relativism in Rajiv Malhotra's Being Different", International Journal of Hindu Studies, 16 (3): 335–348, doi:10.1007/s11407-012-9133-z&lt;/ref&gt; They were also influenced by Western ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Halbfass, Wilhelm (2007a), "Research and reflection: Responses to my respondents. III. Issues of comparative philosophy (pp. 297-314)", in Franco, Eli; Preisendanz, Karin, Beyond Orientalism: the work of Wilhelm Halbfass and its impact on Indian and cross-cultural studies (1st Indian ed.), Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, {{ISBN|8120831101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these movements was that of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] of [[Ram Mohan Roy]] (1772-1833).&lt;ref&gt;Michelis, Elizabeth De (2005), A History of Modern Yoga: Patanjali and Western Esotericism, Continuum, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-8772-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swami Vivekananda]] (1863-1902) was very influential in developing the [[Hindu reform movements]] and in bringing the worldview to the West.&lt;ref&gt;Georg, Feuerstein (2002), The Yoga Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass&lt;/ref&gt; Through the work of Indians like Vivekananda as well as westerners such as the proponents of the [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical society]], modern Hindu thought also had an [[Hinduism in the West|influence on western culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Renard, Philip (2010), Non-Dualisme. p. 185-188. De directe bevrijdingsweg, Cothen: Uitgeverij Juwelenschip&lt;/ref&gt;

The political thought of [[Hindu nationalism]] is also another important current in modern Indian thought. The work of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Sri Aurobindo|Aurobindo]], [[Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] have had a large impact on modern Indian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Modern Indian Thought. By V. S. Naravane. (New York: Asia Publishing House, 1964. Pp. xiii + 310. Foreword by ttumayun Kabir.) https://muse.jhu.edu/article/229758/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jainism]] also had its modern interpreters and defenders, such as [[Virchand Gandhi]], [[Champat Rai Jain]], and [[Shrimad Rajchandra]] (well known as a spiritual guide of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]).

==Buddhist philosophies==

[[File:Nalanda_university.jpg|thumb|The Buddhist [[Nalanda]] university and monastery was a major center of learning in India from the 5th century AD to c. 1200.]]
[[File:Monks debating at Sera monastery, 2013.webm|thumb|Monks debating at [[Sera monastery]], Tibet, 2013]]

[[Buddhist philosophy]] begins with the thought of [[Gautama Buddha]] (fl. between sixth and fourth centuries BCE) and is preserved in the [[Buddhist texts#Texts of the Early schools|early Buddhist texts]]. It generally refers to the philosophical investigations that developed among various [[Buddhist schools]] in India and later spread throughout Asia through the [[silk road]]. Buddhist thought is trans-regional and trans-cultural. It is the dominant philosophical tradition in [[Tibet]] and Southeast Asian countries like [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Burma]].

[[Buddhism]]'s main concern is soteriological, defined as freedom from [[dukkha]] (unease).&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Skirbekk, Nils Gilje, ''A history of Western thought: from ancient Greece to the twentieth century.'' 7th edition published by Routledge, 2001, page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]] to the true nature of things is considered one of the roots of suffering, Buddhist thinkers concerned themselves with philosophical questions related to epistemology and the use of reason.&lt;ref name="Siderits, Mark 2007, page 6"&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Key Buddhist concepts include the [[Four Noble Truths]], [[Anatta]] (not-self) a critique of a fixed [[personal identity]], the transience of all things ([[Anicca]]), and a certain [[The unanswered questions|skepticism about metaphysical questions]]. Buddhist thinkers in India and subsequently in [[East Asia]] have covered topics as varied as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[ethics]], [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]] and [[philosophy of time]].

Later Buddhist philosophical traditions developed complex phenomenological psychologies termed '[[Abhidharma]]'. [[Mahayana]] philosophers such as [[Nagarjuna]] and [[Vasubandhu]] developed the theories of [[Shunyata]] (emptiness of all phenomena) and Vijnapti-matra (appearance only), a form of phenomenology or [[transcendental idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Sean (2011) "Idealism in Yogācāra Buddhism," The Hilltop Review: Vol. 4: Iss. 1, Article 6. Available at: http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/hilltopreview/vol4/iss1/6&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dignāga]] (c. 480–540) school of [[Pramāṇa]] promoted a complex form of [[epistemology]] and [[Buddhist logic]]. This tradition contributed to what has been called an "epistemological turn" in Indian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence J. McCrea, and Parimal G. Patil. Buddhist Philosophy of Language in India: Jnanasrimitra on Exclusion. New York: Columbia University Press, 2010. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the work of [[Dharmakirti]], this tradition of Buddhist logic has become the major epistemological system used in [[Tibetan Buddhist]] philosophy and debate.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Georges B. J. Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti's Philosophy and Its Tibetan Interpretations. page 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the disappearance of Buddhism from India, these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the [[Tibetan Buddhist]], [[East Asian Buddhist]] and [[Theravada Buddhist]] traditions. In Tibet, the Indian tradition continued to be developed under the work of thinkers like [[Sakya Pandita]], [[Tsongkhapa]] and [[Ju Mipham]]. In China, new developments were led by thinkers such as [[Xuangzang]] who authored new works on [[Yogacara]], [[Zhiyi]] who founded the [[Tiantai]] school and developed a new theory of [[Madhyamaka]] and [[Guifeng Zongmi]] who wrote on [[Huayan]] and [[Zen]].

===Buddhist modernism===
{{Main|Buddhist philosophy#Modern philosophy|Buddhist modernism}}
[[File:Hu Shih and D. T. Suzuki.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hu Shi]] and [[DT Suzuki]] during his visit to China in 1934]]
The modern period saw the rise of [[Buddhist modernism]] and [[Humanistic Buddhism]] under Western influences and the development of a [[Buddhism in the West|Western Buddhism]] with influences from modern psychology and Western philosophy. Important exponents of Buddhist modernism include [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] (1864-1933) and the American convert [[Henry Steel Olcott]], the Chinese modernists [[Taixu]] (1890-1947) and [[Yin Shun]] (1906–2005), Zen scholar [[D. T. Suzuki|DT Suzuki]], and the Tibetan [[Gendün Chöphel]] (1903–1951). Buddhist modernism refers to "forms of Buddhism that have emerged out of an engagement with the dominant cultural and intellectual forces of modernity."&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, David L. (2008). The Making of Buddhist Modernism. Oxford University Press. page 6&lt;/ref&gt; Forces which influenced modernists like [[Anagarika Dhammapala|Dhammapala]], and Yin Shun included Enlightenment values, and Western Science. A [[Neo-Buddhist movement]] was founded by the influential Indian [[Dalit]] leader [[B. R. Ambedkar]] in the 1950s who emphasized social and political reform.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Tartakov (2003). Rowena Robinson, ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=eNsoAAAAYAAJ ''Religious Conversion in India: Modes, Motivations, and Meanings'']. Oxford University Press. pp. 192–213. {{ISBN|978-0-19-566329-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist modernism includes various movements like [[Humanistic Buddhism]], [[Secular Buddhism]], the [[Vipassana movement]], and [[Engaged Buddhism]]. Chinese [[humanistic Buddhism]] or "Buddhism for Human Life" (Chinese: 人生佛教; pinyin: rénshēng fójiào) which was to be free of supernatural beliefs has also been an influential form of modern Buddhism in Asia.&lt;ref name="mbingenheimer.net"&gt;Bingenheimer, Marcus (2007).

East Asian philosophical thought began in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Chinese philosophy]] begins during the [[Western Zhou]] Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the "[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]" flourished (6th century to 221 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Garfield  (Editor), Edelglass (Editor); ''The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy'', Chinese philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pe"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ebrey |first=Patricia|year=2010 |page= 42|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major Chinese philosophical schools ([[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Daoism]]) as well as numerous less influential schools ([[Mohism]], [[School of Names]], [[School of Yin Yang]]). These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories which, along with [[Chinese Buddhism]], had a direct influence on the rest of [[East Asian cultural sphere|the East Asian cultural sphere]]. Buddhism began arriving in China during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE), through a [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|gradual Silk road transmission]] and gradually developed distinct Chinese forms (such as Chan/[[Zen]]).

====Confucianism====
{{Main|Confucianism}}
[[File:Konfuzius-1770.jpg|thumb|x230px|[[Confucius]]]]
[[Confucianism]] (''Kǒngjiào'' — "Confucius' doctrine"), also known as "Ruism" (''Rújiào'' — "doctrine of the scholars"), is a Chinese philosophical system with ritual, moral, and religious applications.&lt;ref&gt;Yao, Xinzhong (2000). An Introduction to Confucianism. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521643120}}. pp. 38-47.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition developed around the teachings of [[Confucius]] (''Kǒng Fūzǐ'', 孔夫子, "Master Kong", 551–479 BCE) who saw himself as transmitting the values and theology of the ancestors before him.&lt;ref&gt;Fung, Yiu-ming (2008), "Problematizing Contemporary Confucianism in East Asia", in Richey, Jeffrey, Teaching Confucianism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0198042566}}. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Other influential classical Confucian philosophers include [[Mencius]] and [[Xun Kuang]] who famously disagreed on the innate moral nature of humans.

Confucianism focuses on humanistic values like familial and social harmony, [[filial piety]] (孝, ''xiào''), ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|Rén]]'' (仁, "benevolence" or "humaneness") and ''[[Li (Confucianism)|Lǐ]]'' (禮/礼) which is a system of ritual norms that determines how a person should act to be in harmony with the law of Heaven. Confucianism traditionally holds that these values are based on the transcendent principle known as [[Tian|Heaven]] (''Tiān'' 天), and also includes the belief in spirits or gods (''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shén]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, Ronnie (2010), Confucianism: An Introduction, I. B. Tauris, {{ISBN|184885174X}}. pp. 34-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism was a major ideology of the imperial state during the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE) and was revived as [[Neo-Confucianism]] during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907). During later Chinese dynasties like [[Song dynasty|Song Dynasty]] (960-1297) and the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644) as well as in the Korean [[Joseon dynasty]] (1392–1897) a resurgent [[Neo-Confucianism]] led by thinkers such as [[Zhu Xi]] (1130–1200) and [[Wang Yangming]] (1472–1529) became the dominant school of thought, and was promoted by the imperial state. Beginning in the [[Song dynasty]], [[confucian classics]] were the basis of the [[imperial exams]] and became the core philosophy of the [[Scholar-officials|scholar official class]]. Confucianism suffered setbacks during the 20th century, but is recently undergoing a revival, which is termed [[New Confucianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Elman, John Duncan and Herman Ooms ed. ''Rethinking Confucianism: Past and Present in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam''(Los Angeles: UCLA Asian Pacific Monograph Series, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, East Asian cultures and countries in the [[East Asian cultural sphere|cultural sphere]] are strongly influenced by Confucianism, including [[Culture of China|Mainland China]], [[Culture of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Culture of Macau|Macau]], [[Culture of Japan|Japan]], [[Culture of Korea|Korea]], and [[Culture of Taiwan|Taiwan]], as well as various overseas territories settled predominantly by [[Overseas Chinese]], such as [[Culture of Singapore|Singapore]].

====Legalism====
[[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] ([[pinyin]]: ''Fǎjiā;'' school of "methods" or "standards")&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Goldin, Persistent Misconceptions about Chinese Legalism. p.6,7 https://www.academia.edu/24999390/Persistent_Misconceptions_about_Chinese_Legalism_&lt;/ref&gt; was a philosophical tradition which focused on laws, realpolitik and bureaucratic management.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Terril 2003 p.68. The New Chinese Empire. https://books.google.com/books?id=TKowRrrz5BIC&amp;pg=PA68&lt;/ref&gt; Largely ignoring [[morality]] or idealized views of how society should be, they focused on pragmatic [[government]] through the power of the [[Autocracy|autocrat]] and [[State (polity)|state]]. Their goal was achieving increased order, security and stability.&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), 2. Philosophical Foundations. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-legalism/&lt;/ref&gt; They were initially influenced by Mohist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad. Philosophy East &amp; West. Jul94, Vol. 44 Issue 3, p435. 54p. Fa (standards: laws) and meaning changes in Chinese philosophy.

Chad Hansen, Shen Buhai http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/Shen%20Bu%20Hai.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A key figure of this school was administrator and political philosopher [[Shen Buhai]] (c. 400–337 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Creel, 1974 p.4, 119 Shen Pu-hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Another central figure, [[Shang Yang]] (390–338 BC), was a leading statesman and reformer who transformed the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] into the dominant power that conquered the rest of China in 221 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen, University of Hong Kong. Lord Shang. http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/Lord%20Shang.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Shen's successor [[Han Fei]] (c. 280 – 233 BC) synthesized the thought of the other Legalists in his [[eponym]]ous text, the ''[[Han Feizi]],'' one of the most influential Legalist texts which was used by successive Chinese statesmen and rulers as a guide for statesmanship and bureaucratic organization of the imperial state.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Goldin, Persistent Misconceptions about Chinese Legalism. p.15 https://www.academia.edu/24999390/Persistent_Misconceptions_about_Chinese_Legalism_&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hengy Chye Kiang 1999. p.44. Cities of Aristocrats and Bureaucrats. https://books.google.com/books?id=BIgS4p8NykYC&amp;pg=PA44&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mohism====
[[Mohism]] (''Mòjiā''; "School of Mo"), was founded by [[Mozi]] (c. 470 BC–c. 391 BC) and his students. It was a major school of thought and rival of Confucianism and Taoism during the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States period|Warring States]] periods (c. 770–221 BC). The main text of the school is the [[Mozi (book)|''Mozi'' (book)]]. The administrative thought of Mohism was later absorbed by Legalism, their ethics absorbed into Confucianism and its books were also merged into the [[Taoist canon]], as Mohism all but disappeared as independent school after the [[Qin dynasty]] era.

Mohism is best known for the idea of "impartial care" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 兼愛; [[pinyin]]: ''jiān ài''; literally: "inclusive love/care").&lt;ref&gt;The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Edited by Edward Craig. Routledge Publishing. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Master Mo, persons should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to them. Mo also advocated impartial [[meritocracy]] in government which should be based on talent, not blood relations. Mozi was against Confucian ritualism, instead emphasizing [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] survival through farming, [[fortification]], and [[Public administration|statecraft]]. Tradition is inconsistent, and human beings need an extra-traditional guide to identify which traditions are acceptable. The moral guide must then promote and encourage social behaviors that maximize general benefit. As motivation for his theory, Mozi brought in the ''Will of Heaven'', but rather than being religious his philosophy parallels [[utilitarianism]].

Mohism was also associated with and influenced by a separate philosophical school known as the [[School of Names]] (''Míngjiā''; also known as 'Logicians'), which focused on [[philosophy of language]], [[definition]] and [[logic]].

====Taoism====
[[File:WLA vanda The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove.jpg|thumb|x160px|The [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]], embroidery, 1860-1880]]
{{Main|Taoist philosophy}}
Taoism (or Daoism) is a term for various philosophies and religious systems which emphasize harmony with the ''[[Tao]]'' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 道; [[pinyin]]: ''Dào''; literally: "the Way") which is seen as the principle which is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard; Rosenberg; Tignor, Elizabeth; Clifford; Robert (2011). ''Worlds Together Worlds Apart''. New York, New York: Norton. p. 164. {{ISBN|9780393918472}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taoism tends to emphasize virtues such as ''[[wu wei]]'' (effortless action), ''[[ziran]]'' (naturalness), [[Pu (Daoism)|''pu'']] (simplicity), and spontaneity while placing less emphasis on norms and ritual (as opposed to Confucianism). The [[Taoism and death|attainment of immortality]] through external alchemy ([[waidan]]) and internal alchemy ([[neidan]]) was an important goal for many taoists historically.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Maspero, ''Taoism and Chinese Religion'', translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. (University of Massachusetts Press, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

Early forms of Taoism developed in the 4th century BCE, influenced by the cosmological theories of the [[School of Naturalists]] and the ''[[I Ching]].'' The School of Naturalists or Yin-yang was another philosophical school that synthesized the concepts of [[yin-yang]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]]; [[Zou Yan]] is considered the founder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan "Zou Yan"]. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 1 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Dao De Jing]]'' (''Tao-Te-Ching,'' ca. 4th century BCE), traditionally attributed to [[Laozi]], and the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Nan Hua Jing]]'' (''Zhuang Zi'') are considered the key texts of the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Livia, ed. ''Daoism Handbook'' (Leiden: Brill, 2000). p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The first organized form of Taoism, the [[Tianshi Dao|Tianshi]] (Celestial Masters') school arose in the 2nd century CE. [[Xuanxue]] ("deep learning", also "Neo-Taoism") was a major philosophical movement influenced by Confucian scholarship, which focused on the interpretation of the ''[[Yijing]],'' ''[[Daodejing]],'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' and which flourished during the third to sixth centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Alan, "Neo-Daoism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/neo-daoism/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important philosophers of this movement were [[He Yan]], [[Wang Bi]], the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]], [[Ge Hong]] and [[Guo Xiang]].&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers like He Yan and Wang Bi focused on the deep nature of Tao, which they saw as being best exemplified by the term "Wu" (nothingness, non-being, negativity).&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Alan, "Neo-Daoism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/neo-daoism/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other schools rose to prominence throughout Chinese history, such as the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing school]] during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), the [[Lingbao School|Lingbao school]] during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) and the [[Quanzhen School]] which develop during the 13th-14th centuries and during the [[Yuan dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The later Taoist traditions were also influenced by [[Chinese Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern East Asian philosophy===
====Chinese====
[[File:熊十力 1960s.jpg|thumb|right|[[Xiong Shili]] circa 1960]]

Modern Chinese thought is generally seen as being rooted in Classical Confucianism (''Jingxue''), Neo-Confucianism (''Lixue''), Buddhism, Daoism, and ''Xixue'' (“Western Learning” which arose during the late [[Ming dynasty|Ming Dynasty]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Chinese Philosophy," by Yih-Hsien Yu, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Opium war|Opium war of 1839-42]] saw the beginning of Western and Japanese invasions and exploitation of China which was humiliating to Chinese thinkers. The late 19th and early 20th century saw Chinese thinkers such as [[Zhang Zhidong]] looking to Western practical knowledge as a way to preserve traditional Chinese culture, a doctrine that he defined as “Chinese Learning as Substance and Western Learning as Function” (''Zhongti Xiyong'').&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Chinese Philosophy," by Yih-Hsien Yu, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911 and the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]], the [[May Fourth Movement]] sought to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China (such as the old civil service system). There were two major philosophical trends during this period. One was anti-traditional and promoted Western learning and ideas. A key figure of this anti-traditional current was [[Yan Fu]] (1853-1921) who translated various Western philosophical works including Smith's The [[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]] and Mill's [[On Liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Chinese Philosophy," by Yih-Hsien Yu, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also attempts to incorporate Western ideas of [[democracy]], and [[republicanism]] into Chinese political philosophy, notably by [[Sun Yat-Sen]] (1866-1925) at the beginning of the 20th century. Another influential modern Chinese philosopher was [[Hu Shih|Hu Shi]], who was a student of [[John Dewey]] at Columbia University and who promoted a form of pragmatism.

The traditionalists meanwhile sought to revive and fortify traditional Chinese philosophical schools. Chinese Buddhist thought was promoted by thinkers like Yang Rensan and Ou-Yang Jingwu&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Chinese Philosophy," by Yih-Hsien Yu, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; while another influential movement is [[New Confucianism]] (Chinese: 新儒家; [[pinyin]]: ''xīn rú jiā''). New Confucianism is a traditionalist revival of Confucian thought in China beginning in 20th century [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican China]] which is also associated with [[New Conservatism (China)|New Conservatism]]. Key New Confucians of the first generation are [[Xiong Shili]] and [[Feng Youlan|Fung Youlan]].&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Chinese Philosophy," by Yih-Hsien Yu, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The second generation (1950–1979) include individuals like [[Tang Junyi]], [[Mou Zongsan]], and [[Xu Fuguan]], all three students of Xiong Shili. Together with [[Zhang Junmai]], the second generation published the [[A Manifesto for a Re-appraisal of Sinology and Reconstruction of Chinese Culture|New Confucian Manifesto]] in 1958.

The influence of [[Marxism]] on modern Chinese political thought is vast, especially through the work of [[Mao Zedong]], the most famous thinker of [[Chinese Marxist Philosophy]]. Maoism is a [[Chinese Marxist philosophy]] based on the teachings of 20th-century [[Communist Party of China]] revolutionary leader [[Mao Zedong]]. It is based partially on earlier theories by Marx and Lenin, but rejects the urban [[proletariat]] and [[Leninism|Leninist]] emphasis on heavy industrialization in favor of a revolution supported by the peasantry, and a decentralized agrarian economy based on many collectively worked farms. The current government of the [[People's Republic of China]] continues to espouse a pragmatic form of [[socialism]] as [[Ideology of the Communist Party of China|its official party ideology]] which it calls [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]. When the [[Communist Party of China]] [[Chinese Civil War|took over]] the reign, previous schools of thought such as Taoism and Confucianism (except [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]) were denounced as backward, and later purged during the violence of the [[Cultural Revolution]] which saw many Taoist and Buddhist temples and institutions destroyed.

====Japanese====
[[File:FukuzawaYukichi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] (1862) a key civil rights activist and liberal thinker]]
Modern Japanese thought is strongly influenced by Western science and philosophy. Japan's rapid modernization was partly aided by the early study of western science (known as [[Rangaku]]) during the [[Edo period|Edo Period]] (1603 – 1868). Another intellectual movement during the Edo period was [[Kokugaku]] (national study), which sought to focus on the study of ancient Japanese thought, classic texts and culture over and against foreign Chinese and Buddhist cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Earl, David Margarey, Emperor and Nation in Japan, Political Thinkers of the Tokugawa Period, University of Washington Press, 1964, pp. 66 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A key figure of this movement is [[Motoori Norinaga]] (1730 – 1801), who argued that the essence of classic Japanese literature and culture was a sense called [[mono no aware]] ("sorrow at evanescence").&lt;ref&gt;Motoori, Norinaga (2007-01-01).

University of Hawaii Press. {{ISBN|9780824830786}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Meiji period]] (1868 – 1912), the modernist [[Meirokusha]] (Meiji 6, formed in 1874) intellectual society promoted [[Age of Enlightenment|European enlightenment]] thought. Meirokusha philosophers like [[Mori Arinori]], [[Nishi Amane]], and Fukuzawa [[Fukuzawa Yukichi|Yukichi]] sought ways to combine Western ideas with [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]] and values. The [[Shōwa period]] (1926–1989) saw the rise of [[State Shinto]] and [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|Japanese nationalism]].

Japanese Buddhist philosophy was influenced by the work of the [[Kyoto School]] which drew from western philosophers (especially German philosophy) and Buddhist thought and included [[Kitaro Nishida]], [[Keiji Nishitani]], [[Hajime Tanabe]] and [[Masao Abe]]. The most important trend in Japanese Buddhist thought after the formation of the Kyoto school is [[Critical Buddhism]], which argues against several Mahayana concepts such as [[Buddha nature]] and [[Hongaku|original enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="mbingenheimer.net"/&gt;

==Syntheses of Eastern and Western philosophy==
{{Details|Buddhism and Western Philosophy|Perennial philosophy|New Age}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}

There have been many modern attempts to integrate Western and Eastern philosophical traditions.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] developed a philosophy that was essentially a synthesis of [[Hinduism]] with Western thought. He anticipated that the ''[[Upanishad]]s'' (primary [[Hindu]] scriptures) would have a much greater influence in the West than they have had. However, Schopenhauer was working with heavily flawed early translations (and sometimes second-degree translations), and many feel that he may not necessarily have accurately grasped the Eastern philosophies which interested him.

Recent attempts to incorporate Western philosophy into Eastern thought include the [[Kyoto School]] of philosophers, who combined the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Husserl]] with the insights of [[Zen Buddhism]]. [[Watsuji Tetsuro|Watsuji Tetsurô]], a 20th-century [[Japan]]ese philosopher attempted to combine the works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], Nietzsche, and Heidegger with Eastern philosophies. Some have claimed that there is also a definite eastern element within [[Heidegger]]'s philosophy. For the most part this is not made explicit within Heidegger's philosophy, apart from in the dialogue between a Japanese and inquirer. Heidegger did spend time attempting to translate the Tao Te Ching into German, working with his Chinese student Paul Hsaio. It has also been claimed that much of Heidegger's later philosophy, particularly the sacredness of Being, bears a distinct similarity to Taoist ideas. There are clear parallels between Heidegger and the work of Kyoto School, and ultimately, it may be read that Heidegger's philosophy is an attempt to 'turn eastwards' in response to the crisis in Western civilization. However, this is only an interpretation.

The 20th century [[Hindu]] [[guru]] [[Sri Aurobindo]] was influenced by [[German Idealism]] and his [[integral yoga]] is regarded as a synthesis of Eastern and Western thought. The German [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Jean Gebser]]'s writings on the history of [[consciousness]] referred to a new planetary consciousness that would bridge this gap. Followers of these two authors are often grouped together under the term [[Integral thought]].

Swiss psychologist [[Carl Jung]] was deeply influenced by the [[I Ching]]. The I Ching (Book of Changes) is an ancient Chinese text from the Shang Dynasty (Bronze Age 1700BC-1050BC), and uses a system of Yin and Yang, which it places into hexagrams for the purposes of divination. Carl Jung's idea of [[synchronicity]] moves towards an Oriental view of [[causality]], as he states in the [http://www.iging.com/intro/foreword.htm foreword] to Richard Wilhelm's translation of the [[I Ching#Influence on Western culture|I Ching]] (Book of Changes). He explains that this Chinese view of the world is based not on science as the West knows it, but on chance.

==Criticism==
Some Western thinkers claim that philosophy as such is only characteristic of Western cultures. The German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] is even reported to have said that only Greek and German languages are suitable for philosophizing.&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{cite news |first1=Rudolf |last1=Augstein |first2=Georg |last2=Wolff |first3=Martin |last3=Heidegger |title=''Nur noch ein Gott kann uns retten'' |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41238349.html |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=31 May 1976 |pages=193–219 |accessdate=14 June 2013}} [http://www.ditext.com/heidegger/interview.html English translation] by [[William J. Richardson]] in {{cite book |title=Heidegger: the Man and the Thinker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIrWZajVZuwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |editor-first=Thomas |editor-last=Sheehan |orig-year=1981 |year=2010 |version=reprint; [https://books.google.com/books?id=XVnePQAACAAJ 1st edition] |publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]] |location=[[Piscataway, New Jersey]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qIrWZajVZuwC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=%22Only+a+God+Can+Save+Us%22%22:+The+Spiegel+Interview+(1966)+Martin+Heidegger%22 45–67] |ISBN=978-14-1281-537-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still commonplace in Western universities to teach only Western philosophy and to ignore Asian philosophy altogether, or consider only newer Western-influenced Asian thought proper "philosophy". Carine Defoort, herself a specialist in Chinese thought, has offered support for such a "family" view of philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Defoort, Carine. (2001). "Is There Such a Thing as Chinese Philosophy? Arguments of an Implicit Debate",
''Philosophy East and West'' 
51 (3) 393–413.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Rein Raud]] has presented an argument&lt;ref&gt;[[Rein Raud|Raud, Rein]]. (2006) "Philosophies versus Philosophy: In Defense of a Flexible Definition". ''Philosophy East &amp; West'' 56 (4) 618–625. [https://www.academia.edu/217793/Philosophies_vs_Philosophy_In_Defense_of_A_Flexible_Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; against it and offered a more flexible definition of philosophy that would include both Western and Asian thought on equal terms. In response, Ouyang Min argues that philosophy proper is a Western cultural practice and essentially different from ''zhexue'', which is what the Chinese have,&lt;ref&gt;Ouyang Min. (2012). "There is No Need for ''Zhongguo Zhexue'' to be Philosophy" Asian Philosophy 22 (3) 199-223.&lt;/ref&gt; even though ''zhexue'' (originally ''tetsugaku'') is actually a neologism coined in 1873 by [[Nishi Amane]] for describing Western philosophy as opposed to traditional Asian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Havens, Thomas R.H. (1970).''Nishi Amane and Modern Japanese Thought'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the British philosopher Victoria S. Harrison, the category of "Eastern philosophy", and similarly "Asian philosophy" and "Oriental philosophy" is a product of 19th-century Western scholarship and did not exist in East Asia or India. This is because in Asia there is no single unified philosophical tradition with a single root, but various autochthonous traditions which have come into contact with each other over time.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Victoria S; "Eastern Philosophy: The Basics, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Emile, or On Education'''''&lt;!--[sic] (edition: Appleton &amp; Company, 1908); all with the exception of three (1892/1908, 1899, 1983) translations to English use the unaccented form of the name.--&gt; ({{lang-fr|Émile, ou De l’éducation}}) is a treatise on the nature of [[education]] and on the nature of [[man]] written by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who considered it to be the "best and most important" of all his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, Jean-Jacques. ''The Confessions''. Trans. J.M. Cohen. New York: Penguin (1953), 529-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a section of the book entitled "Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar", ''Emile'' was banned in [[Paris]] and [[Geneva]] and was publicly burned in 1762, the year of its first publication.&lt;ref&gt;E. Montin, "Introduction to J. Rousseau's Émile: or, Treatise on education by Jean-Jacques Rousseau", William Harold Payne, transl. (D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1908) [https://books.google.com/books?id=15acAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA316&amp;dq=Emile+burned&amp;ei=sPL6SrHPDIzIyQSXw4CUDw&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=Emile%20burned&amp;f=false p. 316].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[French Revolution]], ''Emile'' served as the inspiration for what became a new national system of education.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Bloch traces the reception of ''Emile'' in France, particularly amongst the revolutionaries, in his book ''Rousseauism and Education in Eighteenth-century France'' Oxford: Voltaire Foundation (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and philosophy==
The work tackles fundamental [[political philosophy|political]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions about the relationship between the [[individual]] and [[society]]—how, in particular, the individual might retain what Rousseau saw as [[noble savage|innate human goodness]] while remaining part of a corrupting collectivity. Its opening sentence: "Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things; everything degenerates in the hands of man".

Rousseau seeks to describe a system of education that would enable the ''natural man'' he identifies in ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762) to survive corrupt society.&lt;ref name="Boyd1963"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Boyd|title=The Educational Theory of Jean Jacques Rousseau|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CKRJNAEACAAJ|year=1963|publisher=Russell|isbn=978-0-8462-0359-9|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; He employs the [[novelist]]ic device of Emile and his [[tutor]] to illustrate how such an ideal [[citizen]] might be educated. ''Emile'' is scarcely a detailed [[parenting]] guide but it does contain some specific advice on raising [[children]].&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, responding in frustration to what he perceived as a gross misunderstanding of his text, wrote in ''Lettres de la montagne'': "Il s'sagit d'un nouveau système d'èducation dont j'offre le plan à l'examen des sages, et non pas d'une méthode pour les pères et les mères, à laquelle je n'ai jamais songé". [It is about a new system of education, whose outline I offer up for learned scrutiny, and not a method for fathers and mothers,  which I've never contemplated.] Qtd. in Peter Jimack, ''Rousseau: Émile''. London: Grant and Cutler, Ltd. (1983), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded by some as the first [[philosophy of education]] in [[Western culture]] to have a serious claim to completeness, as well as being one of the first ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' novels.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, Jean-Jacques. ''Emile.'' Trans. Allan Bloom. New York: Basic Books (1979), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book divisions==
The text is divided into five ''books'': the first three are dedicated to the child Emile, the fourth to an exploration of the [[adolescent]], and the fifth to outlining the education of his female counterpart Sophie, as well as to Emile's domestic and civic life.

===Book I===
[[Image:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]]]
In Book I, Rousseau discusses not only his fundamental philosophy but also begins to outline how one would have to raise a child to conform with that philosophy. He begins with the early physical and emotional development of the infant and the child.

''Emile'' attempts to "find a way of resolving the contradictions between the natural man who is 'all for himself' and the implications of life in society".&lt;ref&gt;Jimack, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous opening line does not bode well for the educational project—"Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things; everything degenerates in the hands of man".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. ''Emile, or On Education''. Trans. Allan Bloom. New York: Basic Books (1979), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; But Rousseau acknowledges that every society "must choose between making a man or a citizen"&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the best "social institutions are those that best know how to denature man, to take his absolute existence from him in order to give him a relative one and transport the I into the common unity".&lt;ref&gt;Roussesau, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; To "denature man" for Rousseau is to suppress some of the "natural" instincts that he extols in ''[[The Social Contract]]'', published the same year as ''Emile'', but while it might seem that for Rousseau such a process would be entirely negative, this is not so. ''Emile'' is not a panegyric for the loss of the noble savage, a term Rousseau never actually used. Instead, it is an effort to explain how natural man can live within society.

Many of Rousseau's suggestions in this book are restatements of the ideas of other educational reformers. For example, he endorses [[John Locke|Locke]]'s program of "harden[ing children's] bodies against the intemperance of season, climates, elements; against hunger, thirst, fatigue".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; He also emphasizes the perils of swaddling and the benefits of mothers nursing their own infants. Rousseau's enthusiasm for [[breastfeeding]] led to him to argue: "[B]ut let mothers deign to nurse their children, morals will reform themselves, nature's sentiments will be awakened in every heart, the state will be repeopled"&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;—a hyperbole that demonstrates Rousseau's commitment to grandiose rhetoric. As Peter Jimack, the noted Rousseau scholar, argues: "Rousseau consciously sought to find the striking, lapidary phrase which would compel the attention of his readers and move their hearts, even when it meant, as it often did, an exaggeration of his thought". And, in fact, Rousseau's pronouncements, although not original, effected a revolution in [[swaddling]] and breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;Jimack, 46-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book II===
The second book concerns the initial interactions of the child with the world. Rousseau believed that at this phase the education of children should be derived less from books and more from the child's interactions with the world, with an emphasis on developing the senses, and the ability to draw [[inference|inferences]] from them. Rousseau concludes the chapter with an example of a boy who has been successfully educated through this phase. The father takes the boy out flying kites, and asks the child to infer the position of the kite by looking only at the shadow. This is a task that the child has never specifically been taught, but through inference and understanding of the physical world, the child is able to succeed in his task. In some ways, this approach is the precursor of the [[Montessori education|Montessori method]].

===Book III===
The third book concerns the selection of a [[Tradesman|trade]]. Rousseau believed it necessary that the child must be taught a manual skill appropriate to his gender and age, and suitable to his inclinations, by worthy role models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rousseau|first=Jean-Jacques|title=Emile or On Education|year=1979|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465-01931-1|pages=202–207|url=https://archive.org/stream/RousseausemileOrOnEducationbloom/Rousseau-Emile#page/n201/mode/2up/search/trade|editor=translation and notes by Allan Bloom|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book IV===
[[Image:EmileFrontispiece.jpeg|thumb|Frontispiece to Rousseau's ''Émile'' by De Launay for the 1782 edition. The original caption reads: "L'éducation de l'homme commence à sa naissance" ("A man's education begins at birth").&lt;ref&gt;Trouille, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Once Emile is physically strong and learns to carefully observe the world around him, he is ready for the last part of his education—sentiment: "We have made an active and thinking being. It remains for us, in order to complete the man, only to make a loving and feeling being—that is to say, to perfect reason by sentiment".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Emile is a teenager at this point and it is only now that Rousseau believes he is capable of understanding complex human emotions, particularly sympathy. Rousseau argues that the child cannot put himself in the place of others but once adolescence has been reached and he is able do so, Emile can finally be brought into the world and socialized.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to introducing a newly passionate Emile to society during his adolescent years, the tutor also introduces him to religion.  According to Rousseau, children cannot understand abstract concepts such as the soul before the age of about fifteen or sixteen, so to introduce religion to them is dangerous. He writes: "It is a lesser evil to be unaware of the divinity than to offend it".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, because children are incapable of understanding the difficult concepts that are part of religion, he points out that children will only recite what is told to them—they are unable to believe.

Book IV also contains the famous "Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar", the section that was largely responsible for the condemnation of ''Emile'' and the one most frequently excerpted and published independently of its parent tome. Rousseau writes at the end of the "Profession": "I have transcribed this writing not as a rule for the sentiments that one ought to follow in religious matters, but as an example of the way one can reason with one’s pupil in order not to diverge from the method I have tried to establish".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau, through the priest, leads his readers through an argument which concludes only to belief in "[[natural religion]]": "If he must have another religion", Rousseau writes (that is, beyond a basic "natural religion"), "I no longer have the right to be his guide in that".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book V===
In Book V, Rousseau turns to the education of Sophie, Emile's wife-to-be. This brief description of female education sparked an immense contemporary response, perhaps even more so than ''Emile'' itself. [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], for example, dedicated a substantial portion of her chapter "Animadversions on Some of the Writers who have Rendered Women Objects of Pity, Bordering on Contempt" in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) to attacking Rousseau and his arguments. 

When responding to Rousseau’s argument in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft directly quotes Émile, ou De l’éducation in Chapter IV of her piece:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Educate women like men,' says Rousseau [in Émile, ou De l’éducation], 'and the more they resemble our sex the less power will they have over us.' This is the very point I aim at. I do not wish them to have power over men; but over themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wollstonecraft|first1=Mary|title=A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|date=1988|publisher=Norton|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

French writer [[Louise d'Épinay]]'s Conversations d'Emilie made her disagreement with Rousseau’s take on female education clear as well. Indeed, she believes that females’ education affects their role in society, not natural differences as Rousseau claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hageman|first1=Jeanne Kathryn|title="Les Conversations d'Emilie": The education of women by women in eighteenth century France|journal=he University of Wisconsin - Madison|date=1991|page=28|oclc=25301342}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Rousseau begins his description of Sophie, the ideal woman, by describing the inherent differences between men and women in a famous passage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In what they have in common, they are equal. Where they differ, they are not comparable. A perfect woman and a perfect man ought not to resemble each other in mind any more than in looks, and perfection is not susceptible of more or less. In the union of the sexes each contributes equally to the common aim, but not in the same way. From this diversity arises the first assignable difference in the moral relations of the two sexes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Rousseau, "everything man and woman have in common belongs to the species, and ... everything which distinguishes them belongs to the sex".&lt;ref name="Rousseau, 358"&gt;Rousseau, 358.&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau states that women should be "passive and weak", "put up little resistance" and are "made specially to please man"; he adds, however, that "man ought to please her in turn", and he explains the dominance of man as a function of "the sole fact of his strength", that is, as a strictly "natural" law, prior to the introduction of "the law of love".&lt;ref name="Rousseau, 358"/&gt;

Rousseau also touches on the political upbringing of Emile in book V by including a concise version of his ''[[The Social Contract|Social Contract]]'' in the book. His political treatise ''The Social Contract'' was published in the same year as ''Emile'' and was likewise soon banned by the government for its controversial theories on [[general will]]. The version of this work in ''Emile'', however, does not go into detail concerning the tension between the Sovereign and the Executive, but instead refer the reader to the original work.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Deneen, ''The Odyssey of Political Theory, pp. 145. [https://books.google.com/books?id=X02TzN09yHYC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=social+contract+book+v+emile&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l2eG1F27Jg&amp;sig=6BDil5zFfJyKO6j45NWNHyDJP9Q&amp;hl=da&amp;ei=J5BMStKFKuCOjAfB4f28BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau’s stance on female education, much like the other ideas explored in Émile, ou De l’éducation, “crystallize existing feelings” of the time period. During the eighteenth century, women’s education was traditionally focused on domestic skills—including sewing, housekeeping, and cooking—as they were encouraged to stay within their suitable spheres, which Rousseau advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Todd|first1=Christopher|title=The Modern Language Review|journal=The Modern Language Review|date=1998|volume=93|issue=4|page=1111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Émile et Sophie'' ==
In the incomplete sequel to ''Emile'', ''Émile et Sophie'' (English: ''Emilius and Sophia''), published after Rousseau's death, Sophie is unfaithful (in what is hinted at might be a drugged rape), and Emile, initially furious with her betrayal, remarks "the adulteries of the women of the world are not more than gallantries; but Sophia an adulteress is the most odious of all monsters; the distance between what she was, and what she is, is immense. No! there is no disgrace, no crime equal to hers".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. ''Emilius and Sophia; or, The Solitaries''. London: Printed by H. Baldwin. (1783), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; He later relents somewhat, blaming himself for taking her to a city full of temptation, but he still abandons her and their children. Throughout the agonized internal monologue, represented through letters to his old tutor, he repeatedly comments on all of the affective ties that he has formed in his domestic life—"the chains [his heart] forged for itself".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''Émile et Sophie'', 46.&lt;/ref&gt; As he begins to recover from the shock, the reader is led to believe that these "chains" are not worth the price of possible pain—"By renouncing my attachments to a single spot, I extended them to the whole earth, and, while I ceased to be a citizen, became truly a man".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''Émile et Sophie'', 58.&lt;/ref&gt; While in ''La Nouvelle Héloïse'' the ideal is domestic, rural happiness (if not bliss), in ''Emile'' and its sequel the ideal is "emotional self-sufficiency which was the natural state of primitive, pre-social man, but which for modern man can be attained only by the suppression of his natural inclinations".&lt;ref&gt;Jimack, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Wilson Paiva, member of the Rousseau Association, "[L]eft unfinished, ''Émile et Sophie'' reminds us of Rousseau's incomparable talent for producing a brilliant conjugation of literature and philosophy, as well as a productive approach of sentiment and reason through education".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/3753090/_Re_visiting_Emile_after_marriage_the_importance_of_an_appendix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
Rousseau's contemporary and philosophical rival [[Voltaire]] was critical of ''Emile'' as a whole, but admired the section in the book which had led to it being banned (the section titled "Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar"). According to Voltaire, ''Emile'' is {{Quote|a hodgepodge of a silly wet nurse in four volumes, with forty pages against Christianity, among the boldest ever known...He says as many hurtful things against the philosophers as against Jesus Christ, but the philosophers will be more indulgent than the priests.}}

However, Voltaire went on to endorse the ''Profession of Faith'' section and called it "fifty good pages... it is regrettable that they should have been written by... such a knave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author=Will Durant|pages=190–191|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German scholar [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] wrote in 1787 that "Emile and its sentiments had a universal influence on the cultivated mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author=Will Durant|pages=889|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnogeology''' is the study of how [[geological]] features were understood by ancient peoples around the globe from a "place-based" perspective, in specific reference to [[traditional knowledge]] and to the stories and ideas about the Earth that were passed down through traditions and the wisdom of elders.  The focus in past research tended to be on the unique ideas and knowledge of [[minorities]] and distinct cultural groups, and how this relates to universal and cross cultural knowledge discovered by humanity as a whole.  Knowledge claims that are based more on universal discoveries and natural science can be found in the subjects of [[philosophy]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[mathematics]], and [[geology]]. The term "ethnogeology" first enters the geological literature through the work of John Murray of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada in the mid-1990s by virtue of his studies of the Northern Cree First Nation geological worldviews in the Province of Manitoba in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, J., 1996, Of pipestone, thunderbird nests, and ilmenite: ethnogeology, myth, and the renaming of a world: Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs, v. 28, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, J., 1997, Ethnogeology and its implications for the aboriginal geoscience curriculum: Journal of Geoscience Education, v. 45, p. 117-121.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, a cadre of geologists and geoscience educators - particularly Dr. Steven Semken of Navajo Community College in Shiprock, New Mexico and colleagues - were examining the interesting connections among Native American traditional knowledge, geoscience concepts, and the unique vision of planet Earth's history as articulated by indigenous ethnogeological wisdom (see references below).

One global example of geological knowledge over thousands of years is the making of rock tools and [[arrowhead]]s.  Worldwide, humans have shaped specific kinds of rock into various tools.  These artifacts are evidence that there was some basic knowledge of which rocks were hard enough and easy enough to chip into various useful forms.  Ancient humans discovered certain rock formations that provided them with materials to work with.  [[Flint]], [[obsidian]], [[chert]], [[copper]] and [[quartz]] were some examples of useful rocks or minerals for thousands of years.

In addition, humans have always used natural, high, and dry ridges for land transportation.  Natural water ways were used for boats, travel, exploration, and trade.  Various types of natural elements were used around the Earth for centuries.  Gold and silver are prized for jewelry and trade.  Good soil is needed for agriculture.  Mountains and rivers provided natural boundaries, defence, and borders for various political groups.

'''''Flora Londinensis''''' is a book that described the [[flora]] found in the [[London]] region of the mid 18th century.  The ''Flora'' was published by [[William Curtis]] in six large volumes. The descriptions of the plants included hand-coloured [[intaglio printing|copperplate]] plates by [[botanical artist]]s such as [[James Sowerby]], [[Sydenham Edwards]] and [[William Kilburn]].

The full title of the book is ''Flora Londinensis, or, Plates and descriptions of such plants as grow wild in the environs of London''.  The first volume was produced in 1777 and the final one, containing a title and an index, was published in 1798. A binary name is given for each species in the survey; common and other names are also ascribed for the general reader.  The remarkable aspect of the volumes was their accessibility.  Previous works on the flora of Britain had been intended for the audience of scientists, apothecaries, and the earlier herbalists. The appealing plates also provided a careful botanical detail which could assist in the identification of a species.

Curtis was ''praefectus horti'' (Director, Society of Apothecaries) at the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]] and a botanist with a broad knowledge of exotic species. However, ''Flora Londinensis'' was to cover the most familiar territory of its author.  Curtis intended documenting the flowering species within a 10-mile radius of London, commissioning several painters cum illustrators to produce hand-coloured copper engravings to accompany the pages.  He undertook writing descriptions, publishing, and sales of the volumes, producing six [[fascicle (book)|fascicle]]s of twelve issues, each containing six plates.  The final survey eventually came to include many species found in southern [[England]] and a few more besides.

Despite praise for the importance of the volumes, the work was not produced beyond 300 copies. Many other works were to be issued; the economics of producing a more affordable volume were yet to be refined. The publication by Curtis, ''[[The Botanical Magazine]]'', was to be a greater financial success.  Sowerby, who helped to publish the volumes and give over seventy of the plates, went on to produce natural history publications in a similar format.

The work was enlarged by [[William Jackson Hooker|William J. Hooker]], who published an edition with his own text in 1817 and 1828.  This enlargement was even more comprehensive, by including species from the other [[British Isles]].

{{Culture of Mexico}}

'''Mexico''' has a variety of cultures which came from European and Mesoamerican cultures. This mix of cultures leads to the creation of traditional tales and narrations better known as myths and legends.

==Myths==

Myths are narrations that tell us about the origin of gods, of the creation of our world and space. The importance of both types of tales is that they are created inside the context of a group and as a result they can be used to see the different characteristics of the group's culture. They usually show us religion, beliefs or try to explain natural phenomena.

===Origin of the Sun and the Moon===

All of the other gods formed two lines around the fire, and then the Tecuciztecatl and Nanahuatzin were placed in front of the fire.  All the gods said to Tecuciztécatl: “Tecuciztécatl enter the fire”, he tried to enter, but he could not.  He tried 4 times but he did not succeed.  It was established that he could not try more than four times. So the gods said to Nanahuatzin: “Try” and, making a big effort and closing his eyes, he entered the fire.

When Tecuciztécatl saw that Nanahuatzin had entered the fire, he ran and entered the fire too... After both gods entered the fire, all the other gods sat and waited to see how Nanahuatzin was going to get out.  After a while the sky started to change its color, it was red and the light of dawn appeared.  It is said that after this, all the gods knelt to wait Nanahuatzin as the sun form.  Some of them thought that Nanahuatzin would rise from the north part.  Others said he would rise at the midday. The gods thought he could rise from everywhere because there was light everywhere.

Some gods looked at the east and said: “Here, the sun will rise from this part”, this phrase was true. One of these gods were [[Quetzalcoatl]] (also known as the god of the wind) and Tótec (lord of the coast lands or red Tezcatlipoca).

When the sun rose it was red and nobody could see it because it was very bright. Then the moon appeared from the same part, they rose in the same order they entered the fire. Those who narrate fables say that they had the same intensity of light so the gods met again and said: “It is not possible that both have the same intensity”. So the gods decided

After the gods got out of the fire, they stood immobile. So the gods had to die to make the sun move. It is said that the sun did not move after the gods died, then the wind started to blow and he made the sun move. That is why they work at different times: the sun lights during the day and the moon works during the night.

===Two loving Volcanoes===

[[Image:MountainIztaccihuatlMexico01.jpg|thumb|A princess whose beauty is ethernal.... Iztaccíhuatl volcano is located in the borders of Puebla and Mexico State... "She" is near her brave lover Popocatepetl]]
[[Image:Mexico-Popocatepetl.jpg|thumb|A north view of Popocatepetl volcano (an inmortal and brave warrior...) which is located on the frontiers of Puebla and Mexico State.]]

Before leaving for war, Popocatépetl asked Iztaccíhuatl's father for permission to marry her. Shortly after, a rival of Popocatépetl falsely told Iztaccíhuatl that her love had been killed in battle. The princess died of grief after she heard this news. Popocatépetl returned victorious but was shocked by the princess's death. To honor her, he ordered a tomb to be built close to the sun. Ten hills were united to create a mountain. Popocatépetl laid the princess's body at the mountaintop, and the whole mountain took on the form of a sleeping woman. Then as the warrior kneeled before his lost love, snow covered them, and they both transformed into volcanoes.

==Legends==

Legends are stories created by anonymous authors with some basis in history but with many embellishments. They talk about facts that occurred in the near past and which characters can or cannot be human. Legends show us the vision of the world and the life that people had with, historical, political, philosophical, and cultural value.

===Colonial Mexico Tales===

During [[Colonialism|Colonial]] era in [[Mexico]], new narrations began to appear. Many of them created from the mix of religion and past belief tried to mix indigenous and [[Christian]]-[[catholic]] beliefs.

====La Calle de la Quemada (The Burnt Woman’s Street)====
[[Image:Salvatierraview.jpg|thumb|A view of Tetilla Guanajuato, where the “Burnt’s girl street” (La Quemada) is said to be located.]]

When Don Luis de Velasco I came to replace the [[Viceroy]] Don Antonio de Mendoza, Don Gonzalo Espinosa de Guevara and his daughter Beatriz lived in a big mansion. She had a beautiful face, lovely eyes, with skin as white as lilies. Her lustrous, silky hair fell from her shoulders and cascaded like a waterfall down her fine back. She was also gentle: she used to care for the sick and the injured and to help poor people.

With such a noble, generous soul, beauty, and a large fortune, it was easy to understand that she had plenty of handsome lovers. Many gentlemen and noblemen fought in front of Beatriz's mansion, but she did not accept anyone.

Finally a gentleman arrived to the mansion—a man whose destiny chose him to be Beatriz's husband. His name was Don Martín de Scópoli, Marquis of Piamonte and Franteschelo, a handsome Italian gentleman who loved Beatriz since the first time he saw her, and his love for her grew with passion.

He fought bravely with every gentleman that wanted to marry Beatriz, showing his strong and eternal love for her. For this reason many gentleman proved themselves fighting for Beatriz trying to defeat the impertinent Italian man. Don Martín fought days and nights under the moonlight, and he always won.

When the sun rose, the police passing through Beatriz's street would always find a dead or injured gentlemen, caused by the sword of the Italian suitor.

Beatriz loved Don Martin immensely because of his demeanor and handsomeness and because of his lovely words. One night, after she had prayed to Santa Lucia (a martyr virgin took out her eyes so as to not be a temptation), she made a terrible decision that would make Don Martin Scúpoli love her no more. The next day, after completing many tasks, such as helping poor people with medicines and food, she confirmed that her father had left and carried to her room a brazier, in which she put charcoal and lit a fire. Suddenly the flames filled the room, and the heat became intense. She prayed to Santa Lucía, and saying Don Martin's name, she knelt down and put her beautiful face over the brazier.

A smell of burning flesh spread throughout the room, taking out the fresh smell of jasmine and almonds. After a few minutes later, Beatriz screamed and fainted next to the brazier. Father Marcos de Jesus and Gracia, who was a confidant of Beatriz, heard Beatriz's scream and ran into the house. He found Beatriz on the floor, he lifted her with care and tried to put some herbs and vinegar on her burnt face, asking her why she had done it.

She explained to him that with this event, Don Martin would finish with the fights and he would stop loving her. After she told him the reasons, Father Marcos explained to Don Martin what had happened. The Italian gentleman hurried to be where his lover was. He found her sitting on an armchair with a black veil that covered her face. The veil was spotted with blood and burnt flesh.

Very carefully he took off the veil from his lover's face, but he did not jump back terrified when he saw her. He was worried, looking at her beautiful white face burnt by the cruel flames. Under the firmly arched eyebrows, there were two holes with burnt eyelids. Her cheeks were open craters where blood drained and her lips which had been so sumptous, worthy of a passionate kiss, were now a hole which formed a horrible grin. After he saw this, the Marquis of Piamonte knelt down and said with tenderness:

"Ah, Beatriz, I love you not for your beauty, but for your goodness.  You are a noble, generous lady, and your soul is pure."

Tears fell with these words, and both cried with love and tenderness.

The Marquis continued, "When your father comes back, I will ask for your hand in marriage."

The wedding of Beatriz and the Marquis de Piedmont was held at the [[Temple of San Felipe Neri "La Profesa"|temple “The Profesa”]] and was the most sensational event of those times. Don Gonzalo Guevara Espinosa spent his fortune on the celebrations and the Marquis of Piedmont gave the bride dresses, jewelry and furniture brought from Italy.

Beatriz arrived to the altar with a white veil on her face in order to avoid the mad curiosity of the people. After this she only went outside to go to the nearby church to hear mass, accompanied by her husband.

Since that day, the street where Beatriz house was once located is now called the Burnt Girl's Street.

====El Callejon Del Beso (The Alley of the Kiss)====
&lt;!-- [[File:View of Guantanamo from hill.jpg|thumb|Guangzhou: heroic, cultural and colonial city from Mexico. In one of its narrow streets was the legend of “El Callean led best” written.]] --&gt;

This is a sad love story of two young people who lived and died in Guanajuato,Mexico: Carmen and Luis. She was as beautiful and pure as an angel, about 20, lovely and single. He was handsome, about 28, tan and tall with an arrogant demeanor, adorned with the best moral qualities, hard-working, honest. With those conditions Luis met Carmen, and as soon as they saw each other, they fell in love. From that moment Luis, went frequently in the evening to Carmen's house after work. And she, with the same feelings, stood on her balcony, beautiful as [[Dulcinea]], white, with big and expressive eyes, in a beautiful and unique [[manila]] dress that her father gave her, so when Luis passed by her house she gave him a beautiful smile.

So the weeks passed by, until Luis dared to greet her and the young lady accepted his greeting with a gentle smile. The next day he started a conversation, shy at the beginning, but polite, as any courtship, after that like any couple of lovers with, love phrases and promises. They quickly started to think of a big wedding, blessed by her mother Madame Matilde, a virtuous and dignified mother that had accepted the relationship between her daughter Carmen and Luis. But Carmen's father did not approve it, because he had already planned marry Ana to a friend of his, which was rich and lived on backing Spain. So Madame Matilde thought that the relationship between Carmen and Luis would probably end, and she decided to tell her husband about the casual meetings that Carmen and Luis had on Carmen's balcony.

One day Carmen's father saw the two lovers talking, and he forbade Luis from seeing his daughter, also threatening to send Carmen to a convent if she continued seeing Luis.

Neither Carmen nor Luis accepted the attitude that Carmen's father took, so Luis decided to reestablish their relationship behind Carmen's father's back. Luis planned to rent a room in the house next door where there was a balcony in front of her balcony in which they could talk without being seen, so they could plan a way to escape and be happy.

So the weeks passed by, hiding their courtship from the sun. They only looked at each other in the moonlight from their balconies while Carmen's father slept. Unfortunately the tragedy came. One night Carmen's father woke up and took a knife from his bureau and in blind fury walked to the balcony of his daughter, he surprised his daughter and he buried the knife into her chest. She died in her lover's arms in the white moonlight. Luis took his lover's white hand and two tears fell down. With a big kiss Luis said good bye to his eternal love: Carmen who died on the Alley of the kiss.

====The Powder of the Viceroy====

In the offices of the Viceroy of [[New Spain]] was an officer named Don Bonifacio. He was a very lazy guy. His payment was the necessary to sustain his wife, his sons and his house. He was always angry, bored, resting in his armchair, and waiting for his meals.

There was no game of the Royal [[Lottery]] in which he wasn't participating. However he never won anything. One day he decided to send a letter to the Viceroy, but what was this letter about?

After sending that letter, every Friday Don Bonifacio walked to the Central Palace and waited in a corner where shadow covered him from the intense sun. The Viceroy, ridding in his white horse, approached every Saturday to Don Bonifacio and gave him a box covered with a little of silver. Usually Marteseo.  Wilkins took the box back to

 Bonifacio was a powerful friend of the Virrey... people gave Don Bonifacio money and gifts to be his friend.

What they didn't know is that Don Bonifacio was not friend of the Viceroy... he was a lazy worker with the great idea of writing to the Viceroy what follows:

“Dear Viceroy… It would be a pleasure if you were able to give me a little of your soil that is inside your palace. I have seen that in your soil everything is green and profitable.  Would you give me the honor of having my crops as beautiful as yours?”

The golden box contained only soil from the [[Viceroy]]'s palace.

It's said that Bonifacio became a very rich and powerful person just because of the magic powder of the [[Viceroy]]

====Pregnant woman and the Eclipse====
In Mexico it is believed that exposure of a pregnant woman to an eclipse will cause her infant to have a cleft lip or palate.

The belief originated with the Aztecs, who thought that an eclipse occurred because a bite had been taken out of the moon. If the pregnant woman viewed the eclipse, her infant would have a bite taken out of its mouth.

An obsidian knife was placed on the woman's abdomen before going out at night to protect her.

This belief remains intact hundreds of years later, the only difference being that today a metal key or safety pin is used for protection.

== Background ==
The word '''embolalia''' comes from the Greek word ''embolos'' which means 'something thrown in', from the word ''emballo-'' meaning 'to throw in',&lt;ref name="Etymology of embolia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?embolalia|title=embolalia - Definition|first=|last=mondofacto|website=www.mondofacto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''-lalia'' meaning 'speech, chattering and babbling; abnormal or disordered form of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordinfo.info/unit/1140|title=lalo-, lallo-, lalio-, lal-, -lalia, -lalic + - Word Information|website=wordinfo.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern linguists led by [[Leonard Bloomfield]] in 1933 call these "hesitation forms", the sounds of stammering (uh), stuttering (um, um), throat-clearing (ahem!), stalling (well, um, that is), interjected when the speaker is groping for words or at a loss for the next thought.&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite news|last=Safire|first=William|title=On Language; Impregnating the Pause|work=The New York Times|page=8|date=16 June 1991|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/16/magazine/on-language-impregnating-the-pause.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French psychiatrist [[Jules Séglas]], on the other hand, referred to the term embolalia, as "the regular addition of prefixes or suffixes to words" and mentioned that the behavior is sometimes used by normal individuals to demonstrate to their interlocutor that they are paying attention to the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Harry Levin and Irene Silverman called formulaic language ''"vocal segregates"'' in their 1965 paper on '''hesitation phenomena''' and found out from their experiments on children that these segregates seem to be less voluntary hesitation phenomena and may be signs of uncontrolled emotionality under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Characteristics ==

===Linguistic features===

====Definition of formulaic sequences====

According to ''The Canadian Modern Language Review'', formulaic sequences are "fixed combinations of [[word]]s that ... can facilitate [[fluency]] in speech by making pauses shorter and less frequent, and allowing longer runs of speech between pauses".&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/canadian_modern_language_review/v063/63.1wood.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A formulaic sequence is "a sequence, continuous or discontinuous, of words or other elements, which is, or appears to be, prefabricated: that is, stored and retrieved whole from memory at the time of use, rather than being subject to generation or analysis by the language grammar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wray|first=Alison|authorlink=Alison Wray|title=Formulaic Language and the Lexicon|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521022126|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They can be found everywhere in language use and "make up a large proportion of any discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt (Ed.)|first=Norbert|title=Formulaic Sequences in Action: An Introduction. In: Schmitt, Norbert (Ed.) Formulaic Sequences: Acquisition, Processing and Use|year=2004|publisher=Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formulaic sequences can be of any length and can be used to express messages, functions, social solidarity and process information very fast without communication misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt (Ed.)|first=Norbert|title=Formulaic Sequences in Action: An Introduction. In: Schmitt, Norbert (Ed.) Formulaic Sequences: Acquisition, Processing and Use|year=2004|publisher=Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Morphology and phonology====

''Filled pauses''

Filled pauses consist of repetitions of syllables and words, reformulation or false starts where speakers rephrase their speech to fit the representation they best perceive, grammatical repairs, and partial repeats that often involve searching for the right words in one's lexicon to carry across an intended meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freed|first=B.|title=Second Language Acquisition in a Study Abroad Context|year=1995|publisher=Amsterdam /Philadelphia: John Benjamins  Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are basically three distinct forms for filled pauses: (i) an elongated central vowel only; (ii) a nasal murmur only; and (iii) a central vowel followed by a nasal murmur.&lt;ref name=Moniz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moniz|first=H. |author2=Mata, A. I. |author3=Viana, M. C.|title=On Filled Pauses and Prolongations in European Portuguese.|journal=Interspeech|year=2007|pages=2645–2648|url=http://www.inesc-id.pt/pt/indicadores/Ficheiros/4060.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a schwa-like quality [ə:], appears to be the most commonly used, some speakers consistently using the neutral vowel [ɨ:] instead, and others use both vowels in the same sentence, depending on the quality of the previous word last vowel.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; Filled pauses vocalizations may be built around central vowels and speakers may differ in their preferences, but that they do not appear to behave as other words in the language.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; The lengthening of words ending in a coronal fricative, for instance, could be obtained by prolonging the entire rhyme and/or the fricative only.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; Most of the time, however, the neutral vowel [ɨ:] is appended to achieve the desired effect.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt;

''Prolonged pauses''

Similarly to filled pauses, single occurrences of prolonged pauses occurring between stretches of fluent speech, may be preceded and followed by silent pauses, as they most often occur on function words with a CV or V structure.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; Even though they are not always central, the vowels of such syllables may be as long as the ones observed for filled pauses.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt;

''Retraced and unretraced restarts''

Riggenbach's 1991 study of fluency development in Chinese learners of English had an analysis of repair phenomena, which included retraced restarts and unretraced restarts.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach&gt;Riggenbach, H. (1991). Towards an understanding of fluency: A microanalysis of nonnative speaker conversations. Discourse Processes, 14: 423–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Retraced restarts refer to the reformulations whereby a portion of the original utterance is duplicated.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt; They can either involve repetition, that is, the precise adjacent duplication of a sound, syllable, word or phrase, or insertion, which refers to a retraced restart with the addition of new unretraced lexical items.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt; Conversely, unretraced restarts refer to reformulations that reject the original utterance, similarly known as false starts.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt;

====Semantics and pragmatics====
The semantics of formulaic language have often been debated on, and to date, there lacks a consensus on whether or not [[filler words]] are intentional in speech and whether or not they should be considered as words or if they are simply side effects of difficulties in the planning process of speech by speakers. Bailey &amp; Ferriera's (2007) paper&lt;ref name=bailey&gt;{{Citation
 | title = The processing of filled pause disfluencies in the visual world

Filler words consist of "Non-lexical fillers" and "Lexical fillers".&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt; "Non-lexical fillers" are recognized as fillers that are not words and "Lexical fillers" are recognized as fillers that are words and both types of fillers are thought to contain little or no semantic information.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt; However, some filler words are used to express certain speech acts. "Yeah", a "Lexical filler", is used to give affirmation, introduce a new topic, shows speaker's perception and understanding, and occurs after a speech management problem when the speakers does not how to continue their speech.&lt;ref name=fischer&gt;{{Citation

Research has shown that people were less likely to use formulaic language in general topics and domains they were more well-versed in, because they were more adept at selecting the appropriate terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schachter|first=S. |author2=F.

====Syntax====
Formulaic language is more likely to occur at the beginning of utterance or phrase and the reason is because it is presumed that there is a greater demand on planning processes at these junctures.&lt;ref name=schnadt&gt;Schnadt, M. J., and M. Corley. submitted. Buying time in spontaneous speech: How speakers accommodate lexical difficulty.&lt;/ref&gt; Features of formulaic language, like filled pauses or repetitions, are most likely to occur immediately prior to the onset of a complex syntactic constituent.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=H. H.|author2=Wasow, T.|title=Repeating words in spontaneous speech.|journal=Cognitive Psychology |year=1998|pages=201–242|url=http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~herb/1990s/Clark.Wasow.98.pdf |format=PDF| doi = 10.1006/cogp.1998.0693|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filled pauses are also likely after the initial word in a complex constituent, especially after function words.&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt; Therefore, listeners might be able to use the presence of a recent filled pause to predict that an ambiguous structure, and this trait is in favor of a more complex analysis .&lt;ref name=bailey /&gt;

There are several different types of formulaic language. One type is relatively universal, often transcending differences in language and to some degree culture. Simple fillers like "Uhm", "Uh", or "Er" are used by many different people in many different settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com.ezlibproxy1.ntu.edu.sg/public/tocnode?query=embolalia&amp;widen=1&amp;result_number=1&amp;from=search&amp;id=g9781405135221_chunk_g978140513522113&amp;type=fuzzy&amp;fuzzy=0&amp;slop=1|title=Blackwell Reference Online - Formulaic Sequences and Language Disorders.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, these types of fillers are considered innocuous, and are often overlooked by listeners, as long as they are not utilized so often that they overshadow the remainder of the conversation.&lt;ref name=Kuniper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuniper|first=K.|title=On the Linguistic Properties of Formulaic Speech.|journal=Oral Tradition |year=2000|pages=279–305|url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/15ii/6_kuiper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of formulaic language are ingrained within specific cultures, and in fact are sometimes considered an identifying characteristic of people who share a particular religion, or live in a specific geographical region.&lt;ref name=Kuniper /&gt; Along with accents, formulaic language of this type is sometimes considered colorful and somewhat entertaining. Writers often make use of this type of speech to give the characters in their writings additional personality, helping to make them unique.&lt;ref name=wisegeek /&gt;

''Fluency''

The study conducted by Dechert (1980) that investigated the speech performance of a German student of English revealed that there is a tendency for speech pauses to be situated at breaks that are consistent with "episodic units".&lt;ref name=Dechert&gt;[Dechert, HW. (1980). Pauses and intonation as indicators of verbal planning in second-language speech productions: Two examples from a case study. In Dechert, HW &amp; Raupach, M. (Eds.), Temporal variables in speech (pp. 271-285).]&lt;/ref&gt; Dechert (1980) found that the more fluent utterances exhibited more pauses at those junctures and lesser within the "episodic units", leading him to posit that the study subject was able to use the narrative structure to pace his own speech with natural breaks in order for him to scout for the words and phrases that are to follow subsequently.&lt;ref name=Dechert /&gt;

Through the comparison of the story retelling utterances collated of second language learners, Lennon (1984) discovered notable disparities in the distribution of pauses between recounting  in the research subjects' first and second languages respectively.&lt;ref name=Lennon&gt;[Lennon, P. (1984). Retelling a story in English. In HW, Dechert, D. Mehle, 8c M. Raupauch (Eds.), Second Language Productions (pp. 50-68). Turbingen: Gunter Narr Verlag.]&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that all of the pauses were found to be located either at clause breaks or following nonintegral components of the clause, without pauses within the clauses.&lt;ref name=Lennon /&gt; On the other hand, the narrators who spoke using their second language exhibited different patterns, with a higher frequency of pauses occurring within the clauses, leading to the conclusion posited by Lennon to be that the speakers seem to be "planning within clauses as well as in suprasegmental units", and hence, the occurrence of pauses within clauses and not at the intersection of clauses could well be an indicator distinguishing fluent and confluent speech.&lt;ref name=Lennon /&gt;

===Discourse features===

====Cognitive load====
[[Cognitive load]] is an important predictor of formulaic language.&lt;ref name=corley /&gt; More [[Speech disfluency|disfluency]] is found in longer utterances&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

====Speech rate====
Formulaic phrases are uttered more quickly than comparable non-formulaic phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexicallab.com/2015/02/words-are-difficult-to-define/|title=2  Words are difficult to define|work=Lexical Lab|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech rate is closely related to cognitive load.&lt;ref name=O&gt;{{Citation

In fast conditions, cognitive processes that result in a phonetic plan, fail to keep up with articulation, and thus, the articulation of the existing plan is restarted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

====Frequency of words====
In Beattie and Butterworth's (1979) study, low frequency content words and those rated as contextually improbable were preceded by hesitations such as fillers.&lt;ref name=beattie&gt;{{Citation

====Domain (addressor vs. addressee)====
Humans are found to be more disfluent overall when addressing other humans as compared to when addressing machines.&lt;ref name=oviatt /&gt; More instances of formulaic language is found in dialogues than in monologues.&lt;ref name=oviatt&gt;{{Citation

==Functions==

===Comprehension cues===

There is a common agreement that [[disfluencies]] are accompanied by important modifications both at the segmental and prosodic levels and that speakers and listeners use such cues systematically and meaningfully. Thus they appear as linguistic universal devices that are similar to other devices and are controlled by the speaker and regulated by language specific constraints.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; In addition, speech disfluencies such as fillers can help listeners to identify upcoming words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | last2 = Schober       | first2 =  M. F.
 | doi=10.1006/jmla.2000.2753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While formulaic language can serve as a useful cue that more is to come, some people do develop an unconscious dependence on these filler words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Visualizing Spoken Discourse: Prosodic Form and Discourse Functions of Interruptions

 | doi=10.3115/1118078.1118106}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this is the case, it is necessary to correct the problem by making the speaker be aware of their over-reliance on formulaic language production and by training the person to make more efficient use of other verbal strategies. As the individual gains confidence and is less apt to have a need for filler words, the predilection toward formulaic language is then able to gradually diminish.&lt;ref name=wisegeek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-automatic-speech.htm|title=What is Automatic Speech?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done by Foxtree (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fox Tree | first1 = J. E. | year = 2001 | title = Listeners' uses of um and uh in speech comprehension | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 320–326 | doi=10.3758/bf03194926}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that both English and Dutch listeners were faster to identify words in a carrier sentence when it was preceded with an "Uh" instead of without an "Uh", which suggested that different fillers have different effects as they might be conveying different information.&lt;ref name=corley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corley|first=M.|author2=Stewart, O. W.|title=Hesitation Disfluencies in Spontaneous Speech: The Meaning of ''um''.|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|year=2008|pages=589–602|url=http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/martinc/offprints/cs_llc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer and Brandt-Pook also found out that discourse particles mark thematic breaks, signal the relatedness between the preceding and following utterance, indicate if the speaker has understood the content communicated, and support the formulation process by signalling possible problems in speech management.&lt;ref name=fischer /&gt;

While fillers might give listeners cues about the information being conveyed, Bailey &amp; Ferreira's study&lt;ref name=Disfluencies&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Disfluencies influence syntactic parsing

A "Good Cue" leads the listener to correctly predict the onset of a new constituent (Noun Phrase, Verb Phrase), whereas a "Bad Cue" leads the listener to incorrectly predict the onset of a new constituent.&lt;ref name=Disfluencies /&gt; "Good Cue" make it easier for listeners to process the information they have been presented while "Bad Cue" make it harder for listeners process the relevant information.&lt;ref name=Disfluencies /&gt;

There is strong empirical evidence that speakers use formulaic language in similar ways across languages and that formulaic language plays a fundamental role in the structuring of spontaneous speech, as they are used to achieve a better synchronization between interlocutors by announcing upcoming topic changes, delays related to planning load or preparedness problems, as well as speaker's intentions to take/give the floor or to revise/abandon an expression he/she had already presented.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt;

===Communicative goals===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that parts of formulaic language, such as fillers, serve a communicative function and are considered integral to the information the speaker tries to convey, although they do not add to the propositional content or the primary message.&lt;ref name=foxtree /&gt; Instead, they are considered part of a collateral message where the speaker is commenting on her performance.&lt;ref name=foxtree /&gt; Speakers produce filled pauses (e.g. "Uh" or "Um") for a variety of reasons, including the intention to discourage interruptions or to gain additional time to plan utterances.&lt;ref name=bailey /&gt;

Another communicative goal includes the attention-impelling function,&lt;ref name="Safire" /&gt; which explores another purpose of hesitation forms as being to dissociate oneself slightly from the harsh reality of what is to follow.&lt;ref name="Safire" /&gt; With the use of a beat of time filled with a meaningless interjection, uncommitted people who are "into distancing" make use of such formulaic language to create a little distance between themselves and their words, as if it might lessen the impact of their words.&lt;ref name="Safire" /&gt;

However, not all forms of formulaic language are considered appropriate or harmless.There are examples of formulaic language production that lean towards being offensive, for instance, the use of anything considered to be [[profanity]] within a given culture.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"/&gt;

In this form, the speech is usually the insertion of [[swear words]] within the sentence structure used to convey various ideas. At times, this use of formulaic language comes about due to the individual being greatly distressed or angry.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"/&gt; However, there are situations where swear words are inserted unconsciously even if the individual is extremely happy.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"/&gt; When the use of swear words is called to the attention of the individual, he or she may not even have been aware of the usage of such formulaic language.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"/&gt;

==Neurological basis==

===Medical cases===

====Aphasia====
{{Main article|Aphasia}}
Many patients who suffer from [[aphasia]] retain the ability to produce formulaic language, including conversational speech formulas and swear words—in some cases, patients are unable to create words or sentences, but they are able to swear. Also, the ability to pronounce other words can change and evolve during the process of recovery, while pronunciation and use of swear words remain unchanged.&lt;ref name="journal.frontiersin.org"/&gt;

Patients who are affected by [[transcortical sensory aphasia]], a rare form of aphasia, have been found to exhibit formulaic language that is characterised by "lengthy chunks of memorized material".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csuchico.edu/~pmccaffrey/syllabi/SPPA336/336unit8.html McCaffrey, Patrick. Transcortical Sensory Aphasia. ''The Neuroscience on the Web Series: Neuropathologies of Language and Cognition'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apraxia of speech====

[[Apraxia of speech]] can also occur in conjunction with [[dysarthria]] (muscle weakness affecting speech production) or aphasia (language difficulties related to neurological damage).&lt;ref name=apraxia&gt;[http://speakeffectively.com/apraxia.shtml Britchkow, Ela.

The characteristics of apraxia of speech include difficulties in imitating speech sounds, imitating no-speech movements, such as sticking out the tongue, groping for sounds, and in severe cases, the inability to produce any sounds, inconsistent errors and a slow rate of speech. However, patients who suffer from apraxia of speech may retain the ability to produce formulaic language, such as "thank you" or "how are you?".&lt;ref name=apraxia /&gt; Apraxia of speech can also occur in conjunction with dysarthria, an illness which inflicts muscle weakness affecting [[speech production]]), or aphasia, which causes language difficulties related to neurological damage.&lt;ref name=apraxia /&gt;

[[File:François Coty and Paul Dubonnet in 1918 with their wives.jpg|thumb|Coty and Paul Dubonnet in 1918 with their wives]]
'''François Coty''' (born '''Joseph Marie François Spoturno'''; 3 May 1874 – 25 July 1934) was a [[French people|French]] [[perfumer]] and businessman. He was a founder of the [[fascist]] [[far-right league|league]] ''[[Solidarité Française]]''. The company he founded in 1904 is now [[Coty, Inc.]], based in New York City.

== Early life and family ==

Joseph Marie François Spoturno was born on 3 May 1874 in [[Ajaccio]], [[Corsica]]. He was a descendant of Isabelle Bonaparte, an aunt of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref name='visionary'/&gt;{{rp|9}} His parents were Jean-Baptiste Spoturno and Marie-Adolphine-Françoise Coti, both descendants of [[Genoa|Genoese]] settlers who founded Ajaccio in the 15th century. His parents died when he was a child and the young François was raised by his great-grandmother, Marie Josephe Spoturno, and after her death, by his grandmother, Anna Maria Belone Spoturno, who lived in [[Marseille]].&lt;ref name="cotybio" /&gt;{{rp|39}}

After spending some years in military service, François met a fellow Corsican named [[Emmanuel Arène]]. A politician, writer, and future senator, Arène became François's mentor, offering him a job in [[Paris]] as his secretary. In Paris, François married Yvonne Alexandrine Le Baron and took the more [[French name|French]]-looking name ''Coty'', a variation on his mother's maiden name. He also met Raymond Goery, a pharmacist who made and sold perfume at his Paris shop. Coty began to learn about perfumery from Goery and created his first fragrance, ''Cologne Coty.''&lt;ref name="cotybio" /&gt;{{rp|49}}

==Perfumer==

Through Arène, Coty met Antoine Chiris, a senator and member of the Chiris family, longtime manufacturers and distributors of [[perfume]]. At the Chiris factories in [[Grasse]], Coty studied perfumery and began work on a fragrance, ''La Rose Jacqueminot.''&lt;ref name="cotybio" /&gt;{{rp|61}} On his return to Paris in 1904, Coty set off to sell his scents to [[department store]]s, boutiques, and barbershops, but initially met with little success. His luck changed when he dropped a bottle of ''La Rose Jacqueminot'' on a countertop at the [[Grands Magasins du Louvre]], the Parisian department store. Attracted by the scent, customers swarmed the area, demanding to buy the perfume. Coty's entire stock was gone in a few minutes and the store offered him a place on the selling floor for his products.&lt;ref name='visionary'&gt;{{cite book | last = Healy | first = Orla | authorlink = | title = Coty: the Brand of Visionary | publisher=Assouline | date = 15 September 2004 | location = New York, New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 2-84323-622-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} The success of ''La Rose'' made Coty a millionaire and established him as a major player in the perfume world.

Coty recognized that an attractive bottle was essential to a perfume's success. Though ''La Rose'' came in a [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat]] bottle, Coty's most famous collaboration was with the great ceramist and jeweler [[René Lalique]]. Lalique designed the bottles for Coty's early scents, such as ''Ambre Antique'' and ''L'Origan'', which became bestsellers. He also designed the labels for Coty perfume, which were printed on a gold background with raised lettering.&lt;ref name='cotylorigan'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.BH1654/ |title=L'origan the golden (advertisement) |accessdate=9 November 2009 |year=1950 |format=JPEG |work=Ad*Access On-Line Project – Ad #BH1654 |publisher=John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising &amp; Marketing History, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lalique's designs for Coty were in the [[Art Nouveau]] style that was prevalent in the period, and incorporated classic Art Nouveau themes such as nature, flowers, and female figures.&lt;ref name='frenchmarket'/&gt;{{rp|261}}

Besides pioneering the concept of bottle design, Coty was responsible for making perfume available to a mass market. Before Coty, perfume was considered a luxury item, affordable only to the very rich. Coty was the first to offer perfumes at many price points. His expensive perfumes, in their Lalique and Baccarat bottles, were aimed at the luxury market, but he also sold perfume in smaller, plainer bottles affordable to middle and working-class women.&lt;ref name='newyorker'&gt;{{cite news | first=Janet | last=Flanner |authorlink= | title=Perfume and Politics | date=3 May 1930 | publisher=| url =http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1930/05/03/1930_05_03_022_TNY_CARDS_000200397 | work=The New Yorker | pages = | accessdate = 20 October 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coty perfume bottles, though mass-produced, were carefully designed to convey an image of luxury and prestige.&lt;ref name='frenchmarket'&gt;{{Citation| first=Helen | last=Caldwell| contribution=1920–1929: The Decade of the French Mystique in the American Perfume Market| title=Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Historical Research in Marketing and Marketing Thought| editor-first=| editor-last=| coeditors=| publisher=| place=| pages=259–272| year=1988| id= | contribution-url=http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%204%201989/259%20caldwell.pdf | accessdate=9 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coty also invented the idea of a fragrance set, a gift box containing identically scented items, such as a perfume and matching powder, soap, cream, and cosmetics.&lt;ref name='cotybio'&gt;{{cite book | last = Toledano | first = Roulhac B. | authorlink = |author2=Elizabeth Z.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:cotyloriganadvertisement.jpeg|thumb|alt=a 1950 advertisement for Coty's L'origan fragrance]] --&gt;
Coty summed up his approach to business when he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Give a woman the best product to be made, market it in the perfect flask, beautiful in its simplicity yet impeccable in its taste, ask a reasonable price for it, and you will witness the birth of a business the size of which the world has never seen.&lt;ref name="cotybio" /&gt;{{rp|100}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1908, Coty relocated his manufacturing headquarters to [[Suresnes]], just outside Paris. He acquired property in the area and began to build what would become "La cité des Parfums", a large complex of laboratories and factories that manufactured his products. "La cité" had 9,000 employees and was able to manufacture up to 100,000 bottles a day.&lt;ref name=visionary/&gt; This allowed Coty to meet the burgeoning demand for his products in France and abroad.

After World War I, demand for French perfume grew at a rapid pace. Many American soldiers had been stationed in France during the war and they brought back Coty perfumes to their wives and relatives. Coty realized the importance of the lucrative American market and began to distribute his products in the United States.&lt;ref name=frenchmarket/&gt;{{rp|260,261}}

In 1921, with the help of executive [[Jean Despres]], Coty created an American subsidiary in New York to handle the assembly and distribution of its products in the American market.&lt;ref name='jeandespres'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=Jean Despres, 84; Ex-Coty Executive Ran U.S. Operation | date=11 September 1988 | publisher=| url =https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/11/obituaries/jean-despres-84-ex-coty-executive-ran-us-operation.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 27 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American offices assembled their own Coty products from raw materials sent by the Parisian factories, thus avoiding the high tariffs on luxury products in the United States. This allowed Coty to offer more competitive prices on its products.&lt;ref name="frenchmarket" /&gt;{{rp|261}} Later, additional subsidiaries were established in the United Kingdom and [[Romania]].&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt;

Coty soon expanded his product line to include cosmetics and skin care, and expanded his distribution network to Europe, Asia, and Latin America. By 1925, 36&amp;nbsp;million women worldwide used Coty face powders.&lt;ref name=visionary/&gt;{{rp|24}} His most popular product was his ''Air-spun'' face powder, launched in 1934. Coty collaborated with famous costume designer [[Léon Bakst]] to create the look of the Air-spun powder box.&lt;ref name="cotybio" /&gt;{{rp|83}} It became so popular that soon afterwards Coty launched the Air-spun powder scented with his most popular perfumes, such as ''L'origan'' and ''Emeraude''.&lt;ref name='cotyairspun'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.BH1634/ |title=Coty Airspun powder: shade-matched for flattery (advertisement) |accessdate=9 November 2009 |year=1941 |format=JPEG |work=Ad*Access On-Line Project – Ad #BH1634 |publisher=John W.

== Involvement in politics ==

Coty was one of the wealthiest men in France; in 1929, his fortune was estimated at US$34&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name='obit'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=Milestones, Aug.6, 1934 | date=6 August 1934 | publisher=| url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747621,00.html | work=Time Magazine | pages = | accessdate = 23 November 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, he was determined to use his wealth to gain a foothold in politics and to influence public opinion. In 1923, after a close race, he was elected senator of Corsica, but his victory proved short-lived. The French Senate annulled his election in 1924 after accusations of bribery surfaced. The loss of his senate seat galled Coty and turned him against the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].&lt;ref name='cotybio'/&gt; {{rp|117}}

In 1922, Coty bought ''[[Le Figaro]]'', a prestigious conservative newspaper with an upper-class readership. Against the will of its staff, Coty changed the newspaper's name to ''Figaro'' and moved its headquarters to the Rond-Point des Champs-Elysées.&lt;ref name='cotybio'/&gt;{{rp|147}} Under Coty's ownership, the journal, once moderately conservative, adopted an [[antisemitic]] extreme right-wing stance on politics and the economy. ''Figaro'' printed many fierce [[antisemitic]] and anti-Communist articles, and was notorious for its strong opposition to the government. Coty's extreme opinions soon alienated his readers and ''Figaro'''s circulation went into free fall.&lt;ref name='cotybio'/&gt;{{rp|148}}

In 1926, Coty worked with Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincaré]] to create a fund to stabilize the French currency. He lent 100&amp;nbsp;million francs to the French government, but never collected on the debt. Despite his largesse, Coty was left out of the group appointed to oversee the fund, possibly because of his controversial political views. Disappointed once again by the French government, Coty pursued its downfall.&lt;ref name='cotybio'/&gt; {{rp|178}}

In 1928, Coty launched ''L'Ami du peuple'', a newspaper aimed at the working class. Priced much lower than other competing newspapers, it soon gained a huge readership.&lt;ref name='newyorker'/&gt; In ''L'Ami du peuple'', Coty, an admirer of [[Benito Mussolini]], argued for the overthrow of the French Republic and the establishment of a [[Bonapartist]] or fascist government in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lazareff | first = Pierre | authorlink = | title = Deadline: the Behind-The-Scenes Story of the Last Decade in France | publisher=Random House | year = 1942 | location = New York, New York | pages = 41–45 | url = https://archive.org/details/deadlinethebehin006492mbp | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coty was also a fierce anti-Semite. In a long series of articles in ''L'Ami du peuple'', he accused Jewish bankers and financiers of enacting "bloody, rapacious, inhuman, tyrannical policies" that had ruined the world. He blamed Jews for establishing communism, for robbing France of its pre-war wealth and glory, and for creating a worldwide economic depression. According to Coty, Jews had allied themselves with Germany and were responsible for its increasing militarization. His incendiary writings did not go unnoticed; on 1 July 1933, he was found guilty in court for libel against Jewish war veterans' groups in France.&lt;ref name='americanjewish'&gt;{{cite journal|title=France 1933|journal=The American Jewish Yearbook 5695|year=1934|editor-last=Schneiderman|editor-first=Harry|volume=36|issue=|pages=167|place=Philadelphia|publisher=The Jewish Publication Society of America|id= |url=http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/Vol_36__1934_1935.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=6 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coty gave financial support to numerous far-right organizations, such as the ''[[Faisceau]]'', the French fascist party, and ''[[Croix-de-Feu]]'', a World War I veterans organization; however, he ended his support after a few years. In 1933, he founded ''Solidarité Française'', a fascist, paramilitary organization headed by himself and his friend [[Maurice d'Hartoy]]. The group peaked during the [[6 February 1934 crisis]] where there was a huge demonstration and later a major riot in front of the [[Palais Bourbon]], when it attempted, in alliance with other far right leagues, to topple the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. The group was outlawed in 1936 by the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government.

The [[Stade François Coty]] in Ajaccio was named after him.

==Personal life==
Coty and Yvonne had two children, Roland and Christiane. Despite his marriage, Coty was well known for his numerous mistresses and illegitimate children.&lt;ref name=visionary/&gt;{{rp|23}} He was known to house his lovers in Paris' Hotel Astoria, and to lavish money and gifts on them. His first mistress then second wife was Henriette Dieudé, a former Coty shopgirl who bore him five children. Coty's love life was widely publicized in the French liberal newspapers, to the detriment of his public image.&lt;ref name=cotybio/&gt;

Coty had a penchant for acquiring and remodeling property. His first major purchase was the Château de Longchamp in 1906, near the [[Bois de Boulogne]], once the property of the famous French civic planner, [[Georges Haussmann]]. Coty used it as a laboratory in which to design his fragrances, bottles, packaging, and advertisements. The renovated Longchamp included a glass dome by Lalique and a stone tower designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]].&lt;ref name=cotybio/&gt;{{rp|67}}

In 1912, he bought the [[Château d'Artigny]] near [[Tours]] and set out to rebuild it. Over a period of 20 years, Coty rebuilt d'Artigny in a grandiose fashion, installing custom-built kitchens, ballrooms, and a large fresco depicting himself, his family, friends, and even his mistresses.&lt;ref name=cotybio/&gt;{{rp|77}} During the 1920s, he resided with his family in a mansion at Avenue Raphael in the Bois de Boulogne, which Coty had rebuilt with etched-glass panels, a stair rail, and a glass ceiling designed by Lalique.&lt;ref name=cotybio/&gt;{{rp|207}}

Coty's most famous acquisition was the hunting pavilion of [[Louveciennes]] near [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], designed by [[Claude Nicholas Ledoux]] for [[Madame du Barry]], mistress of Louis XV. Coty had Louveciennes rebuilt to match Ledoux's original plan, but enlarged it to include a perfume laboratory and a third story.&lt;ref name=cotybio/&gt;{{rp|127}} He also bought the Château Saint-Hélène in [[Nice]], the Villa Namouna in Beaulieu-sur-Mer, and Le Scudo in Ajaccio, Corsica. Though he owned multiple large residences, Coty often lived in a hotel on the [[Champs-Élysées]]. He was something of a recluse, disliking crowds of any kind, and hiding behind his public image.

After 1929, Coty's fortunes began to diminish considerably. Both ''Figaro'' and ''L'Ami du peuple'' had been losing money for years and his perfume business had been affected by the 1929 Wall Street crash.&lt;ref name='timemag'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=France: Catastrophic Coty | date=14 December 1931 | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930035,00.html | work=Time Magazine | pages = | accessdate = 30 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was his divorce that most contributed to his financial ruin.

In 1929, Yvonne divorced Coty and married Leon Cotnareanu. Their divorce settlement stipulated that Coty would pay his ex-wife several millions of francs in three installments, but in 1931 Coty defaulted on the last payment, citing financial hardship.&lt;ref name=cotybio/&gt; Over the next few years, divorce courts ruled in favor of Yvonne, and granted her ownership of most of Coty's fortune and his newspapers.&lt;ref name=cotybio/&gt;{{rp|207}}

He died in 1934 at his home in Louveciennes, of pneumonia and complications after an aneurysm.&lt;ref name=cotybio/&gt;{{rp|216}}

In 1963, Yvonne sold Coty Inc. to pharmaceutical giant [[Pfizer]], with the stipulation that no member of the Coty family would be involved in the company.&lt;ref name=cotybio/&gt;{{rp|276}} Under Pfizer, the company began to distribute its perfumes almost exclusively through drugstores, instead of in department stores as it had previously done. In 1992, Pfizer sold Coty to the German company [[Reckitt Benckiser|Joh. A. Benckiser GmbH]], which owns it today.&lt;ref name=cotybio/&gt;{{rp|284}}

'''Graff''' is a British multinational jeweller based in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graff.com|title=Graff|work=Graff|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vertically integrated company, Graff operations comprise the design, manufacture and retail distribution of jewellery and watches.

==History==
Graff was founded in London in 1960 by [[Laurence Graff]].

==Sourcing==
Graff adheres to the [[Kimberly process]], never knowingly buying or trading rough diamonds from areas where this would encourage conflict or human suffering. The majority of Graff diamonds are laser engraved with unique [[Gemological Institute of America]] tracking numbers, which whilst invisible to the naked eye, allow for their origin to be traced.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Graff’s cutting and polishing processes are carried out in Johannesburg by the South African Diamond Corporation, a division of Graff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sheng |first1=Ellen |title=Graff Executives Tout Jeweler's $1 Billion IPO |url=https://wwd.com/business-news/financial/graff-executives-tout-jewelers-1-billion-ipo-5929302/ |work=WWD |date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Notable diamonds==
'''The Windsor Yellows''' were acquired by Laurence Graff in 1987 in Geneva during the auction of the jewels belonging to [[Wallis Simpson]], Duchess of Windsor. The Duchess was often photographed wearing the Windsor Yellows, a pair of clips of fancy yellow pear shaped diamonds of 51.01 and 40.22 [[Carat (unit)|carat]]s respectively. "I also bought another pair of clips the Duchess had owned," Laurence Graff explains.

'''Universal Century technology''' are technologies from the [[Universal Century]] timeline of the ''[[Gundam]]'' [[anime]] [[metaseries]].  Although they are only fictional technologies, they form the basics of the [[Real Robot]] [[genre]] of anime and are influencing real life academic research &lt;ref name="times"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article5058011.ece ''The Times''], 1 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and different anime series.

== History ==
The Universal Century technologies debuted in '''''Gundam Century''''', written by editors, academy and studios hired by ''OUT'' magazine at that time,&lt;ref&gt;Gundam Century Renewal Version Afterword&lt;/ref&gt; later part of the book was endorsed by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] and [[Bandai]], and some of the authors of the articles within ''Gundam Century'' became official editors and writers of Gundam mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Gundam Officials Acknowledgement&lt;/ref&gt;  A main part of the book surrounds the discussion on real-life technologies including [[space habitat]]s and [[mass driver]].  Later, following the trend of militaristic and technological interest in the community, ''[[Gundam Sentinel]] Special Edition'' included a section called '''imidam 0093''' ('''I'''nnovative '''M'''obile Suit '''I'''nformation '''D'''ictionary, '''A'''nnual Series, intentionally using an '''m''' at the end to reference Gunda''m''), subtitled "''Basic Knowledge of Gundam Mechanics''".  Written by mechanical designer [[Katoki Hajime]], summarized both in- and out-of-universe technologies of the Universal Century, sourcing from ''Gundam Century'', ''Gun Sight'', ''[[VF-1 Valkyrie]]'', ''MS Graphical Guide 1~3'', ''MSV Technical &amp; History 1~3''.&lt;ref&gt;Gundam Sentinel Special Edition&lt;/ref&gt;  Gundam Officials has collected this information and has presented it along with plot history and character summaries in an encyclopedic form, and ''MS Encyclopedia 2003'' has a short technical summary of these technologies in its first section before going into the lists of [[mobile weapons]] in different series, which earlier editions only have.&lt;ref&gt;MS Encyclopedia 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural significance ==
Although fictional technologies seems to carry no real-life significance, these technologies are referred to in almost all of the series of Universal Century.  They became a normal reference of the serial story and attracted publishers to publish books on them.  These technological settings have also since influenced a lot of anime and manga to have their own technological background to a certain degree.&lt;ref&gt;Gundam Officials afterword&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it could be viewed as following the ''[[Star Wars]]'' trend, nothing similar has started before the 1981 publishing of Gundam Century.&lt;ref&gt;Gundam Century renewal version acknowledgment&lt;/ref&gt;  Bandai (with its branch Sunrise) noticed the tradition and has hired writers to write articles for other Gundam series too.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4757722729 G20]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Cosmic Era time line, one of the authors of Gundam Century articles (while still a high school student at that time), Shigeru Morita, who had become a regular employee of Bandai, was assigned to write these kinds of technological articles, possibly a method used by the company to attract Universal Century techno fans to watch the new series.&lt;ref&gt;From the G Field, ''[[Newtype]]'' magazine special edition&lt;/ref&gt;  The series' technology is now serving as the inspiration for academic research in different fields, which could include [[colonization of the moon|moon settlements]] and mega-particle cannon.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

The latest robot technology in Japan is also influenced by Gundam, due to its fictional technologies' being highly adapted from real-world science,&lt;ref&gt;巨大ロボット誕生―最新ロボット工学がガンダムを生む (Birth of Giant Robot - Latest Robotics Engineering birth from Gundam), {{ISBN|4-87966-801-X}}, Shuwa system co., Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Universal Century technologies including [[space colonies]] and [[mobile suit]]s are also viewed academically as to what they can do in real life.&lt;ref&gt;宇宙世紀科学読本―スペース・コロニーとガンダムのできるまで (Universal Century Science digest - From Space colonies to what Gundam can do), {{ISBN|4-04-853155-7}}, Kadokawa Shoten Publishing Co., Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Tokyo International Film Festival 2015, Director Tomino first saw Minovsky Particles as a dramatic device, "Because destroying enemies on the other side of Earth with missiles would not be dramatic, to make people meet and fight in space, ranged weapons have to be rendered useless." and claimed that he did not think of Engineering and Electronics at all.  While researcher(Associate Professor in University of Tsukuba) and media artist Yoichi Ochiai viewed this in the science angle and said that even currently, if computers are not working right, things will get really weak, mixing in analogue in the machine is a correct choice and the setting is excellent.  Ochiai also mentioned the idea in his book "The Age of Magic" saying "The people using computers has a greater power of understanding", and admitted that this view is influenced by [[#Newtypes and related technologies|Newtype]] in Gundam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gundam.info/topic/14158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space colony==

The space colony technology in Universal Century is referenced from the real world projects proposed by [[Gerard K. O'Neill]].

In the [[Universal Century]] (U.C.) timeline, space colonies are placed at the five Earth-Moon [[Lagrangian point]]s. In most cases, a Lagrangian point is home to more than one group of space colonies. Individual colony pairs are known as '''Bunches''', and a group of colonies that occupy a Lagrangian point are known collectively as a '''Side'''. Because Sides sometimes share a single Lagrangian point, it is possible to have two Sides in close orbit to one another. Most colonies in the Universal Century are [[O'Neill cylinder|O'Neill "Island 3" type colony cylinders]], yet a few early built [[Bernal sphere]] (Island 1) and [[Stanford torus]] colonies are still in function, but most are changed to space stations or discarded.&lt;ref&gt;The Day when Science will overtake Science Fiction, {{ISBN|978-4-86146-164-4}}, Eagle Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;  Side 3's colonies are identical in size and shape to the Island 3 design, but doubled the habitable area by removing the large window strips of the Island 3.&lt;ref&gt;Gundam Science, Gundam Century Renewal Version, ISBN / 4-87777-028-3, Kisousha, 15th Mar, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SFW"&gt;Robot &amp; Rockets &amp; Futuropolis, Gundam SF World, Shonen Magazine Deluxe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Epoch1"&gt;The Mobile Suit Epoch Vol. 1, Cities in the sky, Kofu Culture Imagine Publish, Inc., {{ISBN|957-2075-19-5}} (Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobile suit technology ==
These technologies are the basic reasoning for the Universal Century's having mobile suits as the main battle units, replacing [[List of fictional spacecraft#Space fighters|space fighters]].  This has influenced later series to include their own reasoning to rationalize the existence of humanoid fighting vehicles.

=== AMBAC ===
One of the most famous rationale being used is the '''AMBAC''' system, it is referenced in various other series including [[Macross]].&lt;ref&gt;Hobby Japan Feb, 2005 issue, Ball special&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Gundam series, the AMBAC system term is also used in ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam 00]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Special report, Gundam Kyrios section&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Active Mass Balance Auto-Control''' (AMBAC) is a fundamental technology that allows for thrusterless manoeuvring in the zero-G environment of space by mobile suits by means of precise movement control of their limbs in the Gundam universe.&lt;ref&gt;Gundam Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gundam Officials&lt;/ref&gt; AMBAC works by leveraging [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion|Third Law of Motion]] (when there's an action there is an equal and opposite reaction) with regard to [[inertia]] to effect changes in direction.  Mobile suits performing AMBAC motions would presumably move similarly to present-day [[astronauts]] performing [[extra-vehicular activity]]: both typically having roughly similar body structure, their use of that mass to control their rotation would presumably be similar, even if calculated by different means.  AMBAC is by its nature limited to re-orienting the unit about its center of mass, and is not a substitute for propulsion.  It is often used in conjunction with the propulsion system to quickly turn the unit and shorten aiming speed as well as directing the main thrusters.  The system is similar in principle to the [[momentum wheel]] system used in present-day satellites, though obviously more complex and allows the [[centre of mass]] move outside of the unit.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"&gt;Gundam Sentinel special edition Gundam Wars III, ASIN: 4499205301, 大日本絵画 (Dai Nippon Kaiga Co. Ltd.), Sept, 1989. (May, 2006, 11th edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tail Binder and Wing Binder ====
'''Binders''' are technological instruments that provide extra control for the AMBAC systems. The idea is simple: "If four limbs can manoeuvre the unit better than none, why not equip them with 5 or more?"  The resulting advancement is the '''tail binder'''.

A cousin to the tail binder is the '''wing binder''', equipped on most transformable mobile suits with [[waverider]] mode as wings. The system made use of the wings' mobility for the transformation during mobile suit mode as AMBAC limbs and further increasing the number of '''limbs''' for the AMBAC system. The tail binder is also seen on later models of military aircraft and space fighters in U.C.0088, on the FF-08 Wyvern.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"/&gt;

== Minovsky physics ==
{{Distinguish|Minkowski space}}
The Minovsky physics is the fundamental technological advancement in the Universal Century series, as all [[Particle beam|Beam weaponry]], [[Nuclear fusion|nuclear]] technology and [[Force shield|defensive measures]] are based upon this fictional physics.  According to the ''Gundam Century'', ''MS encyclopedia 2003'' and Gundam Officials, the '''Minovsky Physics''' all started from the invention of the then seemingly impossible idea of a nuclear fusion reactor that has a higher theoretical efficiency than classical physics, due to the Minovsky particle.

The Minovsky-Ionesco reactor was named after its fictional inventors, Dr. Y.T. Minovsky and Dr. Ionesco. This reactor was "radical" because it was the first "clean" nuclear reactor, emitting zero neutron radiation. The nuclear equation was:

: &lt;math&gt;{}^3_2\mathrm{He} + {}^2_1\mathrm H \to {}^4_2\mathrm{He} + \mathrm p&lt;/math&gt; (energy released: 18.35 [[Electron volt|MeV]])

This is essentially the same equation as used in classical physics&lt;!--which equation?--&gt;, with the addition of the fictional Minovsky particle as a catalyst, instead of a [[muon]].

=== The Minovsky particle ===
According to the official guide of Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam Century and Gundam Officials, the Minovsky Physics Society, while working on the reactor, encountered a strange [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] wave effect in U.C.0065 within the Minovsky-Ionesco reactor that could not be explained by conventional physics. Within the next few years, they identified the cause: a new elementary particle generated by the helium-3 reaction on the inner wall of the reactor, which was named the {{nihongo|'''Minovsky particle'''|ミノフスキー粒子|Minofusukī ryūshi}} or '''"M" particle'''. The Minovsky particle has near-zero rest mass - though, like any particle, its mass increases to reflect its [[potential energy|potential]] or [[kinetic energy]] - and can carry either a positive or negative electrical charge. When scattered in open space or in the air, the repulsive forces between charged Minovsky particles cause them to spontaneously align into a regular cubic lattice structure called an '''I-field'''. An I-field lattice will slowly expand and scatter into space; however, after dense interference it will take approximately 29 days before the region can support normal electromagnetic communication again.

The main use of the Minovsky particle was in combat and communication. When the Minovsky particle is spread in large numbers in the open air or in open space, the particles disrupt low-frequency electromagnetic radiation, such as microwaves and radio waves. The Minovsky particle also interferes with the operations of electronic circuitry and destroys unprotected circuits due to the particles' high electrical charge which act like a continuous [[electromagnetic pulse]] on metal objects. Because of the way Minovsky particles react with other types of radiation, radar systems and long-range wireless communication systems become useless, infra-red signals are defracted and their accuracy decreases, and visible light is fogged. This became known as the "Minovsky Effect".

The disruption of electromagnetic radiation is due to the small lattice of the I-field creating fringes that long wavelengths cannot penetrate, and that diffract wavelengths that have similar distance with the fringes. This [[diffraction]] and [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] process disrupts the electromagnetic waves.&lt;ref&gt;科学．謎？なぜ？読本, Science, Mystery? Why? Digest, 宝島社, Takarajima sha, {{ISBN|978-4-7966-7118-7}}, P166, What is the Minovsky Particle in Gundam?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Introduction to particle physics, source attribute above 3 sections--&gt;

The only counter measure to the "M" particle in the series was to install bulky and expensive shielding on all electronic equipment, but only to counteract the effect it had on electronic circuitry. While this could be done for space ships and naval ships, this ruled out the use of precision guided weapons, such as [[guided missiles]]. Due to this, the military use of Minovsky particles ushered in a new era of close-range combat. This is the primary reason for the birth of the Zeon close-combat weapon: the mobile suit.&lt;ref name="GnWWII"&gt;Gundam and World War II, Doitsu Suzuki, Kosaido Shuppan, {{ISBN|4-331-50999-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minovsky ultracompact fusion reactor ===
According to the timeline deduced by the Gundam Officials, in UC 0071, Zeon researchers created the '''Minovsky ultracompact fusion reactor'''. Instead of the conventional magnetic field, this improved version of the Minovsky-Ionesco reactor used an I-field to confine and compress the reactor fuel, triggering a fusion reaction. The Minovsky particles produced as a byproduct of the helium-3 fusion reaction were recycled to keep that reaction going. The Minovsky particles that form the I-field lattice also helped catalyze the fusion reaction, in a process similar to the [[muon-catalyzed fusion]] investigated by real-world scientists during the 1950s. This super-efficient design was only a fifth as large as an equivalently powerful Minovsky-Ionesco reactor; for this reason, it was adopted for use on mobile suits as the standard power plant.&lt;ref name="GnWWII"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epoch2"&gt;The Mobile Suit Epoch Vol. 2, Sun in a box, Kofu Culture Imagine Publish, Inc., {{ISBN|957-2075-21-7}} (Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mega-particle cannon ===
The fictional weapons of the Universal Century were described to be utilizing the [[degenerate matter|degeneracy]] of the Minovsky Particle by compressing Minovsky particles in high pressure chambers and firing out the degenerated Minovsky particles (from the fusing of a positively charged and a negatively charged one) which carries high energy and mass from the degeneration of the matter.&lt;ref name="GnWWII"/&gt;

Smaller versions of the mega particle cannon are presented in the series, the most famous being the Beam rifle used by the titular mobile suit [[Gundam (mobile suit)|RX-78 Gundam]], which utilizes a technology called E-cap. The mobile suit does not need to spend lots of energy in compressing the Minovsky particles; instead, most of the compression was done by the mother-ship and the mobile suit only needed to provide minimum energy for triggering the final degeneration energy.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epoch1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WDbio"&gt;ガンダム「武器．防具」伝, Gundam "Weapons, Defensive measures" biography, PHP publication&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that E-cap technology appears outside of UC continuity in ''[[MS Saga: A New Dawn]]''.

==== Beam smart gun ====

According to ''Gundam Sentinel Special Edition'', the '''beam [[Smartgun|smart gun]]''' is designed to bend the output beam by up to 20 degrees.  In the original ''Mobile Suit Gundam'' series, [[Char Aznable]] commented that the way to avoid a beam rifle is to avoid its being pointed at you.  As such, a gun that does not need to be pointed directly at the target is more dangerous.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sentinel"/&gt;

=== Funnels ===
'''Funnels''' are essentially funnel-shaped drone units that are designed to be remotely controlled by a Newtype pilot.  They are equipped with a small beam cannon and an energy cell to propel the funnel when it is operating.  A Newtype pilot is able to control these funnels with great precision via a '''psycommu system''', allowing him/her to conduct [[beyond visual range|BVR]] attacks on a target from almost all directions without having to establish visual contact, making a funnel-equipped mobile suit extremely deadly.  When the funnels are not in use, they are attached to the mother suit's surface hardpoints for recharging.  All Zeon funnel-equipped units have the ability to recharge funnels, but the Earth Federation Forces were very slow in adopting the technology.

Later variants include '''Funnel missiles''' that are [[guided missile]]s using funnel-like remote control designs employed in the story ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway's Flash]]''.

==== Cultural influence ====

The new DACS (Divert &amp; Attitude Control System) created by the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] in December, 2006 was quoted as an attempt to create a funnel system in real life by Gizmodo Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmodo.jp/2007/10/post_2477.html Gizmodo Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Newtypes and related technologies ==
The word '''Newtype''' first came into being when Zeon Zum Deikun, the fictional character, founder of the space colony-based Principality of Zeon, created his philosophy: mankind was destined to leave the Earth for space, where they would evolve into a new stage of evolution, called the Newtype.

As Newtypes began to grow in number during and following the One Year War, the '''psycommu''' ('''psy'''chic '''commu'''nicator) system was invented, which allowed these Newtypes to control wireless weapons known as bits and funnels, and even mobile suits, through thought alone. The device detects and amplifies the user's [[Neural oscillation|brainwave]]s, and a sophisticated computer system enables the user to manipulate weapons by using his/her mind.

The '''Psycoframe''' is a later technology that builds the psycommu into the [[nanomachine]]s within the metal frame of a mobile suit. This allows a Newtype pilot to control the mobile suit as if it were his/her own body. A ''Psychoframe'' can project a '''Psychofield''', which can happen when two ''Psychoframes'' are near, this ''Psychofield'' is a space where the human consciousness can manipulate the world regardless of the laws of psychics.

Other Newtype technologies are the '''Bio-Sensor''' system, the '''Quasi-psycommu''' system, the '''Neo-psycommu''' system, the '''Bio-computer''', the '''EXAM System''', the '''Angel Halo''' fortress, and the ''NT-D'' system.

'''''Hansel &amp; Gretel''''' is a 2013  [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[horror film]] produced by [[The Asylum]] and directed by [[Anthony C. Ferrante]]. A modern take of the [[Brothers Grimm]] [[Hansel and Gretel|fairytale of the same name]], the film stars [[Dee Wallace]], Brent Lydic and Stephanie Greco. The film is a [[mockbuster]] of the [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]] film ''[[Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters]]''.

== Plot ==
Teen siblings Hansel and Gretel Grimm are abducted by an elderly recluse named Lilith and witness the horrors of her home in the woods. Lilith and her moronic sons are involved in a conspiracy to fatten up children before she eats them and the local population to serve in meat pies in her local shop "the Gingerbread House". The plot revolves around their attempts to escape the clutches of this old age pensioner, and her mute sons.

== Cast ==
* [[Dee Wallace]] as Lilith
* [[Brent Lydic]] as Hansel Grimm
* [[Stephanie Greco]] as Gretel Grimm
* [[Steve Hanks]] as Brandon Grimm
* [[Sara Fletcher]] as Jane
* [[Clark Perry]] as Kevin
* M. Steven Felty as Sheriff Woody Meckes
* [[Adrian Bustamante]] as Deputy Gerry Carter
* [[Jasper Cole]] as John

== Production ==
Director Anthony C. Ferrante personally asked Dee Wallace to join the production. Wallace was drawn to her character because it was more than just a stereotypical witch. Wallace found the shooting grueling; besides issues with the budget and time limitations, temperatures rose to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and there was no air conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interview/exclusive-dee-wallace-talks-hansel-and-gretel-and-lords-salem|title=Exclusive: Dee Wallace Talks 'Hansel and Gretel' and 'Lords of Salem'|last=Wax|first=Alyse|work=[[Fearnet]]|date=2013-02-07|accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wallace performed her own stunts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailydead.com/exclusive-interview-dee-wallace-talks-hansel-gretel-the-lords-of-salem/|title=Exclusive Interview: Dee Wallace talks Hansel &amp; Gretel, The Lords of Salem|last=James|first=Jonathan|work=DailyDead.com|date=2013-02-16|accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
The film was released [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] on January 8, 2013. In the tradition of The Asylum's catalog, ''Hansel &amp; Gretel'' is a [[mockbuster]] of the [[Paramount Pictures]]/[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]/[[MTV Films|MTV]] film ''[[Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters]]'', which it preceded by five days.&lt;ref name="Dread Central"/&gt;

== Reception ==
Scott Foy of [[Dread Central]] rated it 3/5 stars and called it "a perfectly okay horror movie" after seeing a misleading pull quote of his comments in a previous article used as ad copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/hansel-gretel-blu-ray-dvd|title=Hansel &amp; Gretel (Blu-ray / DVD)|last=Foy|first=Scott|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2013-01-25|accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark L. Miller of [[AICN]] wrote that the film has "a few worthwhile and creative scenes of grue and gore" but frequently descends into tedious [[torture porn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/60579#7|title=HANSEL &amp; GRETEL (2012)|last=Miller|first=Mark L.|work=[[AICN]]|date=2013-01-28|accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dave Pace of ''[[Fangoria]]'' rated it 2/4 stars and called it "a good evening of entertainment" that, outside of one shocking and imaginative hallucinatory scene, lacks ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/hansel-gretel-movie-review/|title="HANSEL &amp; GRETEL" (Movie Review)|last=Pace|first=Dave|work=[[Fangoria]]|date=2013-01-02|accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rod Lott of the ''[[Oklahoma Gazette]]'' wrote that it is "still technically a bad movie, but leagues above the label's usual level of dreck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.okgazette.com/oklahoma/article-17315-hansel-gretel.html|title=Hansel &amp; Gretel|last=Lott|first=Rod|work=[[Oklahoma Gazette]]|date=2013-01-07|accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7274">'''Hayandose''' is a cultural category used to express membership and belonging among Zapotec migrants, described by cultural anthropologist [[Lourdes Gutiérrez-Nájera]]. Hayandose entails a process of creating ethnically-marked spaces among migrants in an effort to combat feelings of [[marginalization]] and [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]] in a host country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Gutiérrez-Nájera, Lourdes. “Hayandose”, in ''Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America''. Ed. Peréz,Gina M., Frank A. Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 211-232.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept may be compared to the notion of Native Hubs developed by anthropologist Renya Ramirez to describe how urban Native Americans negotiate a transnational existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramirez|first=Renya|title=Native Hubs: Culture, Community, and Belonging in Silicon Valley and Beyond|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press Books|isbn=0822340305|pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
== Beyond el Barrio ==
“Hayandose”, in ''Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America'',&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Peréz,Gina M., Frank A. Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 211-232.&lt;/ref&gt; examines the place of indigenous people within the broader scope of Latino Studies and also within the national political landscape. As argued in the text, indigenous subjects do not easily fit the category of "Latino" used to describe national identities; for example, Guatemalan, Mexican, Ecuadorian. At the same time, indigenous migrants often are targets of racism and prejudice directed towards them. The essay is in conversation with other essays in the volume that interrogate the ways that Latinos carve out niches for themselves and thrive in urban spaces within the United States. As the essay Hayandose argues, such established spaces allow migrants, struggling with separation from their home country and racist stigmatization in their host country, to engage in a “meaningful practice of belonging” in which they are able to express their cultural membership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Hayandose marks the point at which people finally feel as though they belong through the discovery of themselves in a foreign place.

== Zapotecs/Gutiérrez-Nájera ==
Gutiérrez-Nájera uses [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] as an example of migrants who originate from [[Oaxaca]], [[México]] and form their own spaces of belonging in the [[United States]], specifically in [[Los Angeles]]. The Zapotecs that Gutiérrez-Najera writes about are from Yalálag, a small rural town in the heart of Oaxaca. The community of Yalaltecos in Los Angeles comes together collectively and participates in festivals, ceremonies, ''tandas'' and other small gatherings where they can gossip in Zapotec, share food, dance, financially and emotionally support one another, and engage in other [[customs]] and [[traditions]] from their place of origin. The existence and practice of customs and traditions that were once thought to be exclusive to Yalálag, but that have now permeated American society, demonstrates the [[International|transnational]] character of Yalaltecos [[indigeneity]] that makes possible the process of Hayandose through the seizure and declaration of these ethnically-marked spaces.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Yalaltecos living in Los Angeles have invoked their [[cultural identity]] hundreds of miles from home and have used it as a tool to resist the push for [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and marginalization within the United States. Therefore, the transmission and continuity of [[culture]] across national borders are essential for Yalaltecos to mark their own space and ultimately find themselves in a hostile environment far from their home country. With this new-found sense of belonging, the opportunity for “rally[ing] for indigenous rights and the development of hometown communities in Oaxaca, as well as to organize in the United States around immigrant legislation” no longer remains out of reach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This claim is reaffirmed by another scholar, Annice Jacoby, who argues that the affirmation of transnational identities allows “borders of ownership, space, and social agency” to be challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby, Annice. "With and Without Permission: Mission Muralismo", in ''Street Art San Francisco: Mission Muralismo''. Ed. Jacoby, Annice. New York: Abrams, 2009. 29-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Once a migrant ''se hayan'', or finds themselves, they have gained a sense of belonging by affirming their cultural membership and confronting their marginalization and displacement within a space collectively or individually marked as their own in the host country. This phenomenon then acts as a bridge for migrants to gain social ascendancy and acknowledgment that has the potential to improve lives in the home and host country alike.

== De/territorialization ==
Hayandose is also reflective of a contemporary cultural process known as de/territorialization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Inda, Johnathan Xavier and Renato Rosaldo. "Introduction: A World in Motion", in ''The Anthropology of Globalization: A Reader''. Ed. Inda, J.X. and R. Rosaldo. Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2002. 1-34.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[emigrants]] moved to the United States they and their culture became deterritorialized.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Once they moved, however, they are simultaneously reterritorialized as they begin to form a space for themselves and practice their customs and traditions as they did in their home country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The theory of de/territorialization can be seen in the Yalalteco community in Los Angeles through the perseverance of their cultural solidarity from Oaxaca to California, and the maintenance of community ties that traverse national boundaries. The theories of de/territorialization and Hayandose entail the movement of culture from one place to another, and thus reveal the “multiple centers” culture can obtain, as opposed to just a single "center" being the place of origin.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Because [[human migration|migration]] causes displacement among emigrants who are forced to adapt to a new environment, culture, and way of living, bringing the culture and customs that they practiced in their places of origin to their new location helps to combat these negative feelings and also adds an additional “center” to their particular culture. In regards to Gutiérrez-Nájera’s example, Yalaltecos adopted Los Angeles as an additional “center” where their customs and traditions could be expressed as they would have been in Yalálag. This sharing of cultures creates a cultural flow between the United States and Oaxacan communities that have allowed emigrants not to lose their culture and sense of who they are, but to maintain it and ultimately use it as a powerful tool to engage in practices of belonging that resist sentiments of marginalization and displacement in new locations.

{{Christian mysticism}}
'''Henosis''' ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:ἕνωσις|ἕνωσις]]}}) is the classical Greek word for mystical "oneness", "union" or "unity." In [[Platonism]], and especially [[Neoplatonism]], the goal of henosis is union with what is fundamental in reality: the One ([[wikt:εἷς|Τὸ  Ἕν]]), the Source, or [[Monism|Monad]].{{sfn|Stamatellos|2007|p=37}} The Neoplatonic concept has precedents in the Greek [[mystery religions]]{{sfn|Angus|1975|p=52}} as well as parallels in [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Gregorios|2002}} It is further developed in the [[Corpus Hermeticum]], in [[Christian theology]], [[Alevism]], [[soteriology]] and [[mysticism]], and is an important factor in the historical development of [[monotheism]] during [[Late Antiquity]].

==Etymology==
The term is relatively common in classical texts, and has the meaning of "union" or "unity".{{refn|group=note|LSJ entry for enosis: ἕνωσις, -εως, ἡ, (from ἑνόω "Ι unite") A. combination into one, union, Philol.10, Archyt. ap.Stob.1.41.2, Arist.Ph.222a20, GC328b22, Phld.Po.2.17, Ph.1.45, al.; “τοῦ συμφραζομένου” A.D.Synt.175.16, cf.

==Process of unification==
{{see also|Nepsis|Theoria}}

Henosis, or [[primordial unity]], is rational and deterministic, emanating from [[indeterminism]] an uncaused cause. Each individual as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] reflects the gradual ordering of the universe referred to as the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]]. In mimicking the demiurge ([[Nous|divine mind]]), one unites with The One or Monad. Thus the process of unification, of "The Being" and "The One," is called henosis, the culmination of which is [[Apotheosis|deification]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Plotinus==
{{Main|Plotinus}}

Henosis for Plotinus (204/5–270 CE) was defined in his works as a reversing of the ontological process of consciousness via [[meditation]] (in the Western mind to un[[Contemplation|contemplate]]) toward no thought ([[nous]] or [[demiurge]]) and no division ([[Dyad (symbol)|dyad]]) within the individual (being). As is specified in the writings of [[Plotinus]] on [[Henology]],{{refn|group=note|Plotinus:&lt;br&gt;* "Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul. To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One. [6.9.7]&lt;br&gt;* "If he remembers who he became when he merged with the One, he will bear its image in himself. He was himself one, with no diversity in himself or his outward relations; for no movement was in him, no passion, no desire for another, once the ascent was accomplished. Nor indeed was there any reason or though, nor, if we dare say it, any trace of himself." [6.9.11.]}} one can reach a [[tabula rasa]], a blank state where the individual may grasp or merge with The One. This absolute simplicity means that the nous or the person is then dissolved, completely absorbed back into the Monad. 

Within the [[Enneads]] of Plotinus the Monad can be referred to as the Good above the demiurge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]] By Richard T. Wallis, Jay Bregman, [[International Society for Neoplatonic Studies]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Anti-Gnostic+Polemic+Francisco+Garcia+Bazan+translated+from+Spanish+by+Winifred+T.+Slater+Nous+as+a+%22Second+God%22+According+to+Plotinus+In+Enneads&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rSxQIFc5YE&amp;sig=EgX8IOF26MK-n7CoWUpDONI1sFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA55,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M.

All division is reconciled in the one, the final stage before reaching singularity, called duality (dyad), is completely reconciled in the Monad, Source or One (see [[monism]]). As the one, source or substance of all things the Monad is all encompassing. As infinite and indeterminate all is reconciled in the dunamis or one. It is the demiurge or second emanation that is the nous in Plotinus. It is the demiurge (creator, action, energy) or nous that "perceives" and therefore causes the force (potential or One) to manifest as energy, or the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]] called the material world. Nous as being, being and perception (intellect) manifest what is called soul ([[Anima mundi|World Soul]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]] By Richard T. Wallis, Jay Bregman, [[International Society for Neoplatonic Studies]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Anti-Gnostic+Polemic+Francisco+Garcia+Bazan+translated+from+Spanish+by+Winifred+T.+Slater+Nous+as+a+%22Second+God%22+According+to+Plotinus+In+Enneads&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rSxQIFc5YE&amp;sig=EgX8IOF26MK-n7CoWUpDONI1sFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA55,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with Aristotle but also various World religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels. Plotinus' works have an [[ascetic]] character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as [[immanent]], with matter as essential to its being, having no true or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendential]] character or essence, substance or ousia. This approach is called philosophical [[Idealism]].{{refn|group=note|[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher: "With [[Plotinus]] there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], ''idealism'' that had long been current in the [[East]] even at that time, for it taught ([[Enneads]], iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the [[soul]] has made the [[world]] by stepping from [[eternity]] into [[time]], with the explanation: 'For there is for this [[universe]] no other place than the soul or [[mind]]' (neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere)."&lt;ref&gt;(''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy," § 7)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Iamblichus of Chalcis==
{{see also|Greek hero cult}}

Within the works of [[Iamblichus of Chalcis]] (c. 245 – c. 325 AD), The One and reconciliation of division can be obtained through the process of [[theurgy]]. By mimicking the demiurge, the individual is returned to the cosmos to implement the will of the divine mind. One goes through a series of theurgy or [[ritual]]s that unites the initiate to the Monad. These rituals mimic the ordering of the chaos of the Universe into the material world or [[cosmos]]. They also mimic the actions of the [[demiurge]] as the creator of the material world. Iamblichus used the rituals of the mystery religions to perform rituals on the individual to unite their outer and inner person. Thus one without conflict internal or external is united (henosis) and is The One (hen).

==Eastern Orthodox Christianity==
In [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]], but also in western mysticism, ''henosis''  can be acquired by [[theoria]], [[hesychasm]] and [[Christian contemplation|contemplative prayer]]. Yet, the concept of [[Theosis (Eastern Christian theology)|theosis]], or deification, differs from henosis, since created beings cannot become God in His transcendent essence, or [[ousia]].

==Plot==
The story is about Himeko Nonohara (野々原姫子 ''Nonohara Himeko''), also known as Hime-chan (姫ちゃん),  an aloof, childlike, yet boasty thirteen-year-old girl who frets over the fact that she is the biggest tomboy in the school.  Himeko would like nothing more than to be a proper, feminine young lady, like her older sister Aiko, so that she could approach her secret crush, Hasekura.

One night, Himeko is unexpectedly approached by a girl, who is a near-mirror image of herself, floating outside of her bedroom window.  She discovers that the girl is Princess Erika of the Magical Kingdom.  Erika explains that people in the Magical Kingdom have an exact counterpart in the Human World and that, in order to prove herself worthy as a princess, she must give Himeko a magical item that she has created.  Himeko is allowed the use of this item, a red hair ribbon, for one year to determine whether it is useful, and consequently, if Erika will inherit the crown.

The ribbon allows Himeko to transform into anyone in the Human World for one hour.  If Himeko is unable to recite the magic incantation in reverse before the hour is up, she will be trapped in that person’s form for the rest of her life. She is unable to reveal the secret of the ribbon and the existence of the Magical Kingdom to anyone. If she does, her memory will be erased as punishment. Assisting her with this is her stuffed lion, Pokota, whom the ribbon brought to life.  Erika will watch her in the Magic Kingdom through her crystal ball for one year, at which point the ribbon will be returned.

==Themes==
In authoring Hime-chan's Ribbon, Megumi Mizusawa used themes common to [[magical girl]] manga. The concept of being able to transform into other people had been a feature of [[Himitsu no Akko-chan]] (1962).

==Characters==

They provide Hime-chan new powers through new accessories other than the ribbon. Hiroshi is a fox-like sprite who has the ability to fly. Masshi does not have a fox-like tail, but looks similar and is lifted from place to place by his partner.

==Incantations==
To perform magic several different incantations are recited. When Hime-chan first receives the ribbon she is told to recite "Parallel, Parallel, ''(person's name)'' ni nare". After the excitement of transformation Hime-chan dismisses Erika's important instruction to recite this incantation saying ''Parallel'' backwards, "Rurerapa rurerapa motono sugatani nare." which causes her to almost be caught as the Principal of the school forever. Pokota had to remind her of the correct way of pronouncing ''Rurerapa'' to avoid this.

|ShortSummary    = A very cute girl named Erika, with long blonde hair and a red ribbon, is having fun flying on a broom, among the clouds high in the night sky. When she emerges from the clouds, a large city far below her comes to view. The girl says that the view from here is great, and she can't see that from the Land of Magic. Then she asks her broom, named Chappy, to fly down closer. Her broom retorts that it's no game and she, the Princess, should go back soon or her father the King will be very mad at her. But the girl says that she has two days to find her look-a-like. After school, a middle-schooler named Himeko is seen walking home with her friend Manami, soon they hear the sound of roller skates getting closer at full speed. A boy with short brown hair is visibly trying to run away from a very mad teacher who calls him Kobayashi and is chasing him for skating in the hallway. When Kobayashi gets cornered in front of a closed door, he throws his school bag at a very surprised Hime-chan, takes a run at the teacher, and impressively jumps over him. Then he picks up his school bag and heads for the playground, with the teacher still after him. Manami says that this boy was the very cool Kobayashi Daichi. Icchan teases her for finding just every boy very cool, but Manami retorts that it's true: Kobayashi is very good at sports and really good-looking. But Hime-chan says he's not her type as she prefers much quieter and intellectual boys."Just like Hasekura-senpai then?" Manami adds, startling Hime-chan. She wonders out loud if Hasekura-senpai, a member of Hime-chan's theater club, is Hime-chan's secret love. As Hime-chan retorts that he's not, Hasekura-senpai, a tall guy with short light brown hair, comes into view and asks her what she was saying about him, making her blush and look down, when she got home Hime-chan remembers that the next day is Hasekura's birthday. A few days later Hime-chan meets Princess Erika-(a look a like version of Himeko) in her room Erika says she is the Princess from the Land of Magic. Hime-chan obviously doesn't believe her at all, and gets up to call her mother. But then she spots Erika's broom Chappy flying around her, so she sits down quietly. Erika continues to tell her story. In the Land of Magic, everybody's duty (such as her father the King) is to prepare/invent magical items. In fact, Chappy herself was invented by Erika's great-great-great-grandfather, and Erika has invented the ribbon she is now holding out to Hime-chan. She adds that it could transform Hime-chan into any other living person on Earth. Hime-chan, as expected, doesn't believe a word of what she said, and Chappy gets mad, yelling that it's the truth. Erika would give her ribbon to Hime-chan for one year, in return for the permission to let her observe Hime-chan for her training. Hime-chan retorts with an angry look that she is NOT a guinea pig. Erika replies that she can't help it because she had to find her copy on Earth to make the experiment with.
She also advises her to take great care of herself when using the magic ribbon.

|ShortSummary    = The next day, Hime-chan wakes up getting ready for school, Hime-chan gets up and grabs Pokota to wish him a good morning. But Pokota doesn't reply, and she realizes that isn't wearing the ribbon,  Then her younger sister Yumeko sneaks in and spots the cute ribbon on Hime-chan's desk. Hime-chan rushes and grabs the ribbon before her sister, and throws her out, saying she will get dressed and go very soon. Hime-chan, realizing that it was not a dream, quickly puts on the bracelet and the ribbon, and Pokota starts talking immediately. He scolds her for not remembering that she must wear the ribbon for him to be able to talk. But she hugs him hard, with tears of joy, because she was thinking she couldn't speak to him any more. Suddenly Hime-chan spots Hasekura-senpai in the bus passing by. She is really worried because his birthday is today and she has lost the amulet that she had gotten for him. With a resolute look, she dashes after the bus, as we see her sister Aiko getting into the bus. Hime-chan wishes she could take the bus with her sister, because that way she would be with Hasekura-senpai. Since she arrives at the school gate late, Hime-chan spots Gori-sensei (the teacher who was after Daichi in the first episode) on guard. But she has an idea to get rid of him, and uses a car mirror to turn herself into the principal. Then she confidently walks to the gate and Gori-sensei lets her in, even bowing at her with respect. But at the very last instant he tells her he thinks he has already seen her go in. Hime-chan/principal scolds him, saying she is the only principal out there.At home, Pokota is still worried about Hime-chan, thinking she could get into trouble if she uses the ribbon for fun. In her crystal ball, Erika and Chappy are looking at Hime-chan as the school principal, Chappy wondering if it's okay to use the ribbon for such things but then Hime-chan spots the real principal coming downstairs, so she rushes to the men's restroom and hides inside. After that she stands in front of a mirror to turn back to her own self. She makes the correct gestures but it doesn't work at all. Doing it three times makes no better. Hime-chan starts panicking. Erika says if she and chappy don't do anything about it Hime-chan will be stuck in the principal's body for the rest of her life; in the men's restroom, Hime-chan is thinking that Erika told her the wrong magic words. But then Pokota, out of breath, sneaks in, carrying a large roll of paper on his back. Hime-chan/principal, in tears, cries out that no matter how many times she says rerurapa, nothing happens. Then Pokota tells her that the reverse of parareru isn't rerurapa but rurerapa. He tells Hime-chan to transform back soon because the bell for the break is ringing and some people might come over. This time the magic words work fine, and Hime-chan, with a quick glance, sneaks out of the restroom. Walking to the theater club's meeting room, Hime-chan thinks to herself that even if she has no present to give Hasekura-senpai, she should at least wish him a happy birthday. But as she goes in, she spots 3 girls giving birthday presents to him. So Hime-chan leaves, deciding to give him a present by all means. She decides that she will go to a nearby shrine to buy another amulet. At the shrine, she throws 100 yen as an offering to Gods, asking them to let her give the amulet to him at least. She wonders why she's the only one who doesn't have the guts to give Hasekura a birthday present, unlike the other girls; She heads for the ladies' restroom and turns herself into her sister Aiko, Walking in the streets, Hime-chan feels much better now, thanks to her sister's body's strength. Everybody (boys and girls) stares at her with envy, saying she is very cute. She even spots some nice dresses in a shop window, but leaves as the sales woman comes to ask her if she'd like to try some on. Now Hime-chan/Aiko is at Hasekura's school gate, waiting for him, but a pushy guy comes to bother her. Hime-chan can't get rid of him, but then Hasekura unexpectedly shows up, saying he's sorry for having made her wait, and takes her hand and leaves. Hime-chan/Aiko is so stunned that he took her sister's hand this naturally that she doesn't say a word. She blushes and gently follows him, her heart beating very fast. After a while, they arrive at the nearby park, Hasekura saying the pushy guy should be far enough now. Realizing he still has her hand in his, Hime-chan/Aiko shyly takes hers back, thanking him nevertheless for what he did, with a cheerful voice. Hasekura says that's nothing, besides he doesn't like those kind of guys at all. Hime-chan/Aiko replies, in the Hime-chan's tomboy-ish style, that she'll beat the tar out of him next time. Hasekura is very surprised to hear her speaking that way, so Hime-chan realizes she has given in to her natural self and laughs more girl-ish-ly with embarrassment, saying that's what she'd like to do. She still can't believe she is talking that casually to Hasekura, and remembers she must give him the amulet this time.

{{Anthropology }}

'''History of anthropology'scientific word during the [[Renaissance]], has always meant "the study (or science) of man". The topics to be included and the terminology have varied historically. At present they are more elaborate than they were during the development of anthropology. For a presentation of modern social and cultural anthropology as they have developed in Britain, France, and North America since approximately 1900, see the relevant sections under [[Anthropology]].

==Etymology==
The term ''[[wiktionary:anthropology|anthropology]]'' ostensibly is a produced compound of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄνθρωπος}} ''anthrōpos'', "human being" (understood to mean "humankind" or "humanity"), and a supposed -λογία ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'', "study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=-logy | work=Online Etymological Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-logy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound, however, is unknown in ancient Greek or Latin, whether classical or mediaeval. It first appears sporadically in the scholarly Latin ''anthropologia'' of Renaissance France, where it spawns the French word ''anthropologie'', transferred into English as anthropology. It does belong to a class of words produced with the [[-logy]] suffix, such as archeo-logy, bio-logy, etc., "the study (or science) of".

The mixed character of Greek ''anthropos'' and Latin ''-logia'' marks it as [[New Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=-logy | encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary Unabridged and Seven Language Dictionary | volume=II H to R | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no independent noun, logia, however, of that meaning in classical Greek. The word λόγος ([[logos]]) has that meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos logos]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] attempted to rescue the etymology in his first address to the [[Anthropological Society of London]] as president and founder, 1863. He did find an ''anthropologos'' from Aristotle in the standard [[A Greek–English Lexicon|ancient Greek Lexicon]], which he says defines the word as "speaking or treating of man".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is entirely wishful thinking, as Liddell and Scott go on to explain the meaning: "i.e. fond of personal conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*a%3Aentry+group%3D178%3Aentry%3Da%29nqrwpolo%2Fgos anthropologos]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Aristotle, the very philosopher of the logos, could produce such a word without serious intent, there probably was at that time no anthropology identifiable under that name.

The lack of any ancient denotation of anthropology, however, is not an etymological problem. Liddell and Scott list 170 Greek compounds ending in ''–logia'', enough to justify its later use as a productive suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=end&amp;lookup=logia&amp;lang=greek logia]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks often used suffixes in forming compounds that had no independent variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buck|1933|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymological dictionaries are united in attributing ''–logia'' to ''logos'', from ''legein'', "to collect". The thing collected is primarily ideas, especially in speech. The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=leg- | encyclopedia=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] | edition=4th | chapter=Appendix I: Indo-European Roots | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "(It is one of) derivatives independently built to logos." Its morphological type is that of an abstract noun: log-os &gt; log-ia (a "qualitative abstract")&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buck|1933|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] origin of the name of anthropology does not exclude the possibility that ancient authors presented anthropogical material under another name (see below). Such an identification is speculative, depending on the theorist's view of anthropology; nevertheless, speculations have been formulated by credible anthropologists, especially those that consider themselves [[Structural functionalism|functionalists]] and others in history so classified now.

==The science of history==
[[Marvin Harris]], a historian of anthropology, begins ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'' with the statement that anthropology is "the science of history".&lt;ref name=Harris1&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is not suggesting that [[history]] be renamed to anthropology, or that there is no distinction between history and [[prehistory]], or that anthropology excludes current social practices, as the general meaning of history, which it has in "history of anthropology", would seem to imply. He is using "history" in a special sense, as the founders of [[cultural anthropology]] used it:&lt;ref&gt;There is currently some regional and traditional equivocation about whether it should be called culture history, as in [[cultural anthropology]]; i.e., [[Culture-historical archaeology]], or [[social history]], as in [[social anthropology]], or the compromise, [[sociocultural anthropology]]. Different theorists have different practices, the distinctions being mainly verbal.&lt;/ref&gt; "the natural history of society", in the words of [[Herbert Spencer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "universal history of mankind", the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]] objective.&lt;ref name=Harris1/&gt; Just as [[natural history]] comprises the characteristics of organisms past and present, so cultural or social history comprises the characteristics of society past and present. It includes both documented history and prehistory, but its slant is toward institutional development rather than particular non-repeatable historical events.

According to Harris, the 19th-century anthropologists were theorizing under the presumption that the development of society followed some sort of laws. He decries the loss of that view in the 20th century by the denial that any laws are discernable or that current institutions have any bearing on ancient. He coins the term ideographic for them. The 19th-century views, on the other hand, are [[nomothetic]]; that is, they provide laws. He intends "to reassert the methodological priority of the search for the laws of history in the science of man".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is looking for "a general theory of history".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His perception of the laws: "I believe that the analogue of the Darwinian strategy in the realm of sociocultural phenomena is the principle of techno-environmental and techno-economic determinism", he calls [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]], which he also details in ''Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture.''

Elsewhere he refers to "my theories of historical determinism", defining the latter: "By a deterministic relationship among cultural phenomena, I mean merely that similar variables under similar conditions tend to give rise to similar consequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1991|pp=xii-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "tends to" implies some degree of freedom to happen or not happen, but in strict [[determinism]], given certain causes, the result and only that result must occur. Different philosophers, however, use determinism in different senses. The deterministic element that Harris sees is lack of human social engineering: "free will and moral choice have had virtually no significant effect upon the direction taken thus far by evolving systems of social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1991|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris agrees with the 19th-century view that laws are [[abstraction]]s from [[empirical evidence]]: "...sociocultural entities are constructed from the direct or indirect observation of the behavior and thought of specific individuals&amp;nbsp;...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions are not a physical reality; only people are. When they act in society, they do so according to the laws of history, of which they are not aware; hence, there is no historical element of free will. Like the 20th-century anthropologists in general, Harris places a high value on the empiricism, or collection of data. This function must be performed by trained observers.

He borrows terms from linguistics: just as a [[phonetics|phon-'''etic''' system]] is a description of sounds developed without regard to the meaning and structure of the language, while a [[phoneme|phon-'''emic''']] system describes the meaningful sounds actually used within the language, so anthropological data can be [[emic and etic]]. Only trained observers can avoid eticism, or description without regard to the meaning in the culture: "...&amp;nbsp;etics are in part observers' emics incorrectly applied to a foreign system...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He makes a further distinction between [[Synchrony and diachrony|synchronic and diachronic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synchronic ("same time") with reference to anthropological data is contemporaneous and cross-cultural. Diachronic ("through time") data shows the development of lines through time. Cultural materialism, being a "processually holistic and globally comparative scientific research strategy" must depend for accuracy on all four types of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural materialism differs from the others by the insertion of culture as the effect. Different material factors produce different cultures.

Harris, like many other anthropologists, in looking for anthropological method and data before the use of the term anthropology, had little difficulty finding them among the ancient authors. The ancients tended to see players on the stage of history as ethnic groups characterized by the same or similar languages and customs: the Persians, the Germans, the Scythians, etc. Thus the term history meant to a large degree the "story" of the fortunes of these players through time. The ancient authors never formulated laws. Apart from a rudimentary [[three-age system]], the stages of history, such as are found in Lubbock, Tylor, Morgan, Marx and others, are yet unformulated.

==Proto-anthropology==
Eriksen and Nielsen use the term proto-anthropology to refer to near-anthropological writings, which contain some of the criteria for being anthropology, but not all. They classify proto-anthropology as being "travel writing or social philosophy", going on to assert "It is only when these aspects&amp;nbsp;... are fused, that is, when data and theory are brought together, that anthropology appears."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Thomas Hylland | last1=Eriksen | first2=Finn Sivert | last2=Nielsen | title=A History of Anthropology | edition=2nd | series=Anthropology, Culture and Society Series | location=London | publisher=Pluto Press | year=1013 | pages=10–12 | url=http://hyllanderiksen.net/History2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process began to occur in the 18th century of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

===Classical Age===
Many anthropological writers find anthropological-quality theorizing in the works of [[Classical Greece]] and [[Classical Rome]]; for example, [[John Myres]] in ''Herodotus and Anthropology'' (1908); E. E. Sikes in ''The Anthropology of the Greeks'' (1914); [[Clyde Kluckhohn]] in ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1961), and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jonathan Z. | last=Smith | title=Map is Not Territory: Studies in the History of Religions | location=Chicage | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=1993 | page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equally long list may be found in French and German as well as other languages.

====Herodotus====
[[Herodotus]] was a 5th-century BC Greek historian who set about to chronicle and explain the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] that transpired early in that century. He did so in a surviving work conventionally termed ''the History'' or ''the Histories''. His first line begins: "These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus&amp;nbsp;...."

The [[Achaemenid Empire]], deciding to bring Greece into its domain, conducted a massive invasion across the [[Bosphorus]] using multi-cultural troops raised from many different locations. They were decisively defeated by the Greek city-states. Herodotus was far from interested in only the non-repeatable events. He provides ethnic details and histories of the peoples within the empire and to the north of it, in most cases being the first to do so. His methods were reading accounts, interviewing witnesses, and in some cases taking notes for himself.

These "researches" have been considered anthropological since at least as early as the late 19th century. The title, "Father of History" (''pater historiae''), had been conferred on him probably by [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=François | last=Hartog | title=The mirror of Herodotus : the representation of the other in the writing of history | series=New historicism, 5. | year=1988 | location=Berkeley | publisher=University of California Press | page=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pointing out that [[John Myres]] in 1908 had believed that Herodotus was an anthropologist on a par with those of his own day, [[James M. Redfield]] asserts: "Herodotus, as we know, was both Father of History and Father of Anthropology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=James M. | last=Redfield | title=Herodotus the Tourist | journal=Classical Philology | year=1985 | volume=80 | pages=97–118 | url=https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/class3676/secure/Redfield.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus calls his method of travelling around taking notes "theorizing". Redfield translates it as "tourism" with a scientific intent. He identifies three terms of Herodotus as overlapping on culture: ''diaitia'', material goods such as houses and consumables; ''[[Ethos|ethea]]'', the mores or customs; and ''nomoi'', the authoritative precedents or [[law]]s.

====Tacitus====
The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian, [[Tacitus]], wrote many of our only surviving contemporary accounts of several ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples]].

===Middle Ages===

Another candidate for one of the first scholars to carry out comparative ethnographic-type studies in person was the medieval [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] in the eleventh century, who wrote about the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. According to Akbar S. Ahmed, like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive [[participant observation]] with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, and presented his findings with [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]] using [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]].&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ahmed | first1 = Akbar S. | year = 1984 | title = Al-Beruni: The First Anthropologist | url = | journal = RAIN | volume = 60 | issue = 60| pages = 9–10 | doi = 10.2307/3033407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue, however, that he hardly can be considered an anthropologist in the conventional sense.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tapper (1995). "Islamic Anthropology" and the "Anthropology of Islam", ''Anthropological Quarterly'' '''68''' (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote detailed comparative studies on the religions and cultures in the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], and especially [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1353/jhi.1998.0030 | last1 = Walbridge | first1 = J.

"Islamic Anthropology" and the "Anthropology of Islam", ''Anthropological Quarterly'' 68 (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt; Biruni's tradition of comparative cross-cultural study continued in the [[Muslim world]] through to [[Ibn Khaldun]]'s work in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=Ahmed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorq.org/Articles/article.aspx?d=2002&amp;x=arabviews West Asian views on black Africans during the medieval era]&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval scholars may be considered forerunners of modern anthropology as well, insofar as they conducted or wrote detailed studies of the customs of peoples considered "different" from themselves in terms of geography. [[John of Plano Carpini]] reported of his stay among the [[Mongols]]. His report was unusual in its detailed depiction of a non-European culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/Publications/Source_pages/AnthroHist.htm Resources for a History of Anthropology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231041925/http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/Publications/Source_pages/AnthroHist.htm |date=2012-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marco Polo]]'s systematic observations of nature, anthropology, and geography are another example of studying human variation across space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tk421.net/essays/polo.html Marco Polo's Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; Polo's travels took him across such a diverse human landscape and his accounts of the peoples he met as he journeyed were so detailed that they earned for Polo the name "the father of modern anthropology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/011rowe.pdf The Renaissance Foundations of Anthropology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904194548/http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/011rowe.pdf |date=2012-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{See also|Bernardino de Sahagún}}
The first use of the term "anthropology" in English to refer to a natural science of humanity was apparently in [[Richard Harvey (astrologer)|Richard Harvey's]] 1593 ''Philadelphus, a defense of the legend of Brutus in British history'', which, includes the passage: "Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did. This part of History is named Anthropology."

==The Enlightenment roots of the discipline==
[[File: Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|left|220px|Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)]]

Many scholars consider modern anthropology as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] (1715–89),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=8407 http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=8407]&lt;/ref&gt; a period when Europeans attempted to study human behavior systematically, the known varieties of which had been increasing since the fifteenth century as a result of the [[first European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|first European colonization wave]]. The traditions of [[jurisprudence]], history, [[philology]], and [[sociology]] then evolved into something more closely resembling the modern views of these disciplines and informed the development of the [[social sciences]], of which anthropology was a part.

It took [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724-1804) 25 years to write one of the first major treatises on anthropology, ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' (1798), which treats it as a branch of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "Introduction" to his 1961 translation of Kant's work, reprinted, [http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpfoucault1.htm Generation-online.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant is not generally considered to be a modern anthropologist, as he never left his region of Germany, nor did he study any cultures besides his own.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Brian, and Kain, Patrick (eds.), Essays on Kant's Anthropology, Cambridge University Press, 2003, 278pp., {{ISBN|0-521-79038-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, begin teaching an annual course in anthropology in 1772.
Developments in the systematic study of ancient civilizations through the disciplines of [[Classics]] and [[Egyptology]] informed both archaeology and eventually social anthropology, as did the study of East and South Asian languages and cultures. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers, such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/sstopics/slovaklawsonlanguage/Herder_on_Language.pdf | title = Herder on Language | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], whose work formed the basis for the "culture concept", which is central to the discipline.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Institutionally, anthropology emerged from the development of [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]) that occurred during the European colonization of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Programs of ethnographic study originated in this era as the study of the "human primitives" overseen by colonial administrations.

There was a tendency in late eighteenth century Enlightenment thought to understand human society as natural phenomena that behaved according to certain principles and that could be observed empirically. In some ways, studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was not unlike studying the flora and fauna of those places.

Early anthropology was divided between proponents of [[unilineal evolution|unilinealism]], who argued that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process, from the most primitive to the most advanced, and various forms of non-lineal theorists, who tended to subscribe to ideas such as [[diffusionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Most nineteenth-century social theorists, including anthropologists, viewed non-European societies as windows onto the pre-industrial human past.

==Overview of the modern discipline==
Marxist anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] once characterized anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the social sciences". Understanding how [[anthropology]] developed contributes to understanding how it fits into other academic disciplines.
Scholarly traditions of [[jurisprudence]], history, [[philology]] and [[sociology]] developed during this time and informed the development of the [[social sciences]] of which anthropology was a part. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as [[Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] whose work formed the basis for the culture concept which is central to the discipline.

These intellectual movements in part grappled with one of the greatest paradoxes of [[modernity]]: as the world is becoming smaller and more integrated, people's experience of the world is increasingly atomized and dispersed. As [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] observed in the 1840s:

{{Quotation|All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilized nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal interdependence of nations.}}

Ironically, this universal interdependence, rather than leading to greater human solidarity, has coincided with increasing racial, ethnic, religious, and class divisions, and new—and to some confusing or disturbing—cultural expressions. These are the conditions of life with which people today must contend, but they have their origins in processes that began in the 16th century and accelerated in the 19th century.

Institutionally anthropology emerged from [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]). This was the study of human beings—typically people living in European colonies. Thus studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was more or less equivalent to studying the flora and fauna of those places. It was for this reason, for instance, that [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] could write monographs on both ''The League of the Iroquois'' and ''The American Beaver and His Works''. This is also why the material culture of 'civilized' nations such as China have historically been displayed in fine arts museums alongside European art while artifacts from Africa or Native North American cultures were displayed in [[natural history museum]]s with dinosaur bones and nature dioramas. Curatorial practice has changed dramatically in recent years, and it would be wrong to see anthropology as merely an extension of colonial rule and European [[chauvinism]], since its relationship to [[imperialism]] was and is complex.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Drawing on the methods of the [[natural science]]s as well as developing new techniques involving not only structured interviews but unstructured "participant-observation"—and drawing on the new [[theory of evolution]] through [[natural selection]], they proposed the scientific study of a new object: "humankind", conceived of as a whole. Crucial to this study is the concept "culture", which anthropologists defined both as a universal capacity and propensity for social learning, thinking, and acting (which they see as a product of human evolution and something that distinguishes Homo sapiens—and perhaps all species of genus ''[[Hominoid|Homo]]''—from other species), and as a particular adaptation to local conditions that takes the form of highly variable beliefs and practices. Thus, "culture" not only transcends the opposition between nature and nurture; it transcends and absorbs the peculiarly European distinction between politics, religion, kinship, and the economy as autonomous domains. Anthropology thus transcends the divisions between the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to explore the biological, linguistic, material, and symbolic dimensions of humankind in all forms.

==National anthropological traditions==
{{Main|History of anthropology by country}}

As academic disciplines began to differentiate over the course of the nineteenth century, anthropology grew increasingly distinct from the biological approach of natural history, on the one hand, and from purely historical or literary fields such as Classics, on the other. A common criticism was that many social sciences (such as economists, sociologists, and psychologists) in Western countries focused disproportionately on Western subjects, while anthropology focuseed disproportionately on the "other".&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
Museums such as the [[British Museum]] weren't the only site of anthropological studies: with the [[New Imperialism]] period, starting in the 1870s, [[zoo]]s became unattended "laboratories", especially the so-called "ethnological exhibitions" or "Negro villages". Thus, "savages" from the colonies were displayed, often nudes, in cages, in what has been called "[[human zoos]]". For example, in 1906, Congolese [[pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] was put by anthropologist [[Madison Grant]] in a cage in the [[Bronx Zoo]], labelled "the missing link" between an orangutan and the "white race"—Grant, a renowned [[eugenicist]], was also the author of ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916). Such exhibitions were attempts to illustrate and prove in the same movement the validity of [[scientific racism]], which first formulation may be found in [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of Human Races]]'' (1853–55). In 1931, the [[Colonial Exhibition]] in Paris still displayed [[Kanaks]] from [[New Caledonia]] in the "indigenous village"; it received 24&amp;nbsp;million visitors in six months, thus demonstrating the popularity of such "human zoos".

Anthropology grew increasingly distinct from natural history and by the end of the nineteenth century the discipline began to crystallize into its modern form—by 1935, for example, it was possible for T.K. Penniman to write a history of the discipline entitled ''A Hundred Years of Anthropology''. At the time, the field was dominated by 'the comparative method'. It was assumed that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process from the most primitive to most advanced. Non-European societies were thus seen as evolutionary 'living fossils' that could be studied in order to understand the European past. Scholars wrote histories of prehistoric migrations which were sometimes valuable but often also fanciful. It was during this time that Europeans first accurately traced [[Polynesia]]n migrations across the [[Pacific Ocean]] for instance—although some of them believed it originated in [[Egypt]]. Finally, the concept of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] was actively discussed as a way to classify—and rank—human beings based on difference.

==== E.B. Tylor and James Frazer====
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|left|Sir E. B. Tylor (1832-1917), nineteenth-century British anthropologist]]
[[File:JamesGeorgeFrazer.jpg|thumb|right|Sir James George Frazer (1854-1941)]]

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (2 October 1832&amp;nbsp;– 2 January 1917) and [[James Frazer|James George Frazer]] (1 January 1854&amp;nbsp;– 7 May 1941) are generally considered the antecedents to modern [[social anthropology]] in Britain. Although Tylor undertook a field trip to [[Mexico]], both he and Frazer derived most of the material for their comparative studies through extensive reading, not [[fieldwork]], mainly the Classics (literature and history of Greece and Rome), the work of the early European folklorists, and reports from missionaries, travelers, and contemporaneous ethnologists.

Tylor advocated strongly for unilinealism and a form of "uniformity of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf Stocking, George Jr. (1963) "Matthew Arnold, E. B. Tylor, and the Uses of Invention", ''American Anthropologist'', 65:783-799, 1963] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202133549/http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf |date=2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tylor in particular laid the groundwork for theories of [[cultural diffusionism]], stating that there are three ways that different groups can have similar cultural forms or technologies: "independent invention, inheritance from ancestors in a distant region, transmission from one race {{sic}} to another".&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1865) ''Researches into the early history of mankind the development of civilization.'' London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor formulated one of the early and influential anthropological conceptions of [[culture]] as "that complex whole, which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by [humans] as [members] of society".&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1871) ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom''. 2 vols. London, John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Stocking notes, Tylor mainly concerned himself with describing and mapping the distribution of particular elements of culture, rather than with the larger function, and he generally seemed to assume a Victorian idea of progress rather than the idea of non-directional, multilineal cultural development proposed by later anthropologists.

Tylor also theorized about the origins of religious beliefs in human beings, proposing a theory of [[animism]] as the earliest stage, and noting that "religion" has many components, of which he believed the most important to be belief in supernatural beings (as opposed to moral systems, cosmology, etc.). Frazer, a Scottish scholar with a broad knowledge of Classics, also concerned himself with religion, myth, and magic. His comparative studies, most influentially in the numerous editions of ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', analyzed similarities in religious belief and symbolism globally. Neither Tylor nor Frazer, however, was particularly interested in [[fieldwork]], nor were they interested in examining how the cultural elements and institutions fit together. The Golden Bough was abridged drastically in subsequent editions after his first.

==== Bronislaw Malinowski and the British School ====
Toward the turn of the twentieth century, a number of anthropologists became dissatisfied with this categorization of cultural elements; historical reconstructions also came to seem increasingly speculative to them. Under the influence of several younger scholars, a new approach came to predominate among British anthropologists, concerned with analyzing how societies held together in the present ([[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] analysis, rather than [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] or historical analysis), and emphasizing long-term (one to several years) immersion fieldwork. [[Cambridge University]] financed a [[William Rivers#Torres Straits Expedition|multidisciplinary expedition]] to the [[Torres Strait Islands]] in 1898, organized by [[Alfred Cort Haddon]] and including a physician-anthropologist, [[William Rivers]], as well as a linguist, a botanist, and other specialists. The findings of the expedition set new standards for ethnographic description.

A decade and a half later, Polish anthropology student [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942) was beginning what he expected to be a brief period of [[fieldwork]] in the old model, collecting lists of cultural items, when the outbreak of the First World War stranded him in [[New Guinea]]. As a subject of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] resident on a British colonial possession, he was effectively confined to New Guinea for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronisław (1967) ''A diary in the strict sense of the term''. New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; World [1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

He made use of the time by undertaking far more intensive fieldwork than had been done by ''British'' anthropologists, and his classic ethnography, ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922) advocated an approach to [[fieldwork]] that became standard in the field: getting "the native's point of view" through [[participant observation]]. Theoretically, he advocated a [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] interpretation, which examined how social institutions functioned to satisfy individual needs.

British social anthropology had an expansive moment in the [[Interwar period]], with key contributions coming from the Polish-British [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Meyer Fortes]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (1995) ''[http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 The Expansive Moment: The Rise of Social Anthropology in Britain and Africa, 1918-1970] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106055917/http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 |date=2007-11-06 }}'' review at {{jstor|646577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] also published a seminal work in 1922. He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the [[Andaman Islands]] in the old style of historical reconstruction. However, after reading the work of French sociologists [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], Radcliffe-Brown published an account of his research (entitled simply ''The Andaman Islanders'') that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths. Over time, he developed an approach known as [[structural functionalism]], which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. (This contrasted with Malinowski's functionalism, and was quite different from the later French [[Structuralism#Structuralism in anthropology and sociology|structuralism]], which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism.)

Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown's influence stemmed from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions that furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for "Social Anthropology" by teaching at universities across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. From the late 1930s until the postwar period appeared a string of monographs and edited volumes that cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology (BSA). Famous ethnographies include ''The Nuer,'' by [[Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]], and ''The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi,'' by [[Meyer Fortes]]; well-known edited volumes include ''African Systems of Kinship and Marriage'' and ''African Political Systems.''

==== Post WW II trends ====
[[Max Gluckman]], together with many of his colleagues at the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] and students at [[Manchester University]], collectively known as the [[Manchester School (anthropology)|Manchester School]], took BSA in new directions through their introduction of explicitly Marxist-informed theory, their emphasis on conflicts and conflict resolution, and their attention to the ways in which individuals negotiate and make use of the social structural possibilities.

In Britain, anthropology had a great intellectual impact, it "contributed to the erosion of [[Christianity]], the growth of [[cultural relativism]], an awareness of the survival of the primitive in modern life, and the replacement of [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] modes of analysis with [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]], all of which are central to modern culture."&lt;ref name="Heyck1997"&gt;Heyck, Thomas William (1997) at The American Historical Review, Vol. 102, No. 5 (December, 1997), pp. 1486–1488 {{doi|10.2307/2171126}} {{jstor|2171126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 1960s and 1970s, [[Edmund Leach]] and his students [[Mary Douglas]] and [[Nur Yalman]], among others, introduced French structuralism in the style of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]; while British anthropology has continued to emphasize social organization and economics over purely symbolic or literary topics, differences among British, French, and American sociocultural anthropologies have diminished with increasing dialogue and borrowing of both theory and methods. Today, social anthropology in Britain engages internationally with many other social theories and has branched in many directions.

In countries of the British Commonwealth, social anthropology has often been institutionally separate from [[physical anthropology]] and [[primatology]], which may be connected with departments of biology or zoology; and from archaeology, which may be connected with departments of [[Classics]], [[Egyptology]], and the like. In other countries (and in some, particularly smaller, British and North American universities), anthropologists have also found themselves institutionally linked with scholars of [[folklore]], [[Museology|museum studies]], [[human geography]], [[sociology]], [[social relations]], [[ethnic studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[social work]].

Anthropology has been used in Britain to provide an alternative explanation for the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]] to the technical explanations rooted in economic and political theory. Dr. [[Gillian Tett]], a [[Cambridge University]] trained anthropologist who went on to become a senior editor at the [[Financial Times]] is one of the leaders in this use of anthropology.

===Canada===
Canadian anthropology began, as in other parts of the Colonial world, as ethnological data in the records of travellers and missionaries. In Canada, [[Jesuit]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] such as Fathers LeClercq, Le Jeune and Sagard, in the 17th century, provide the oldest ethnographic records of native tribes in what was then the Dominion of Canada. The academic discipline has drawn strongly on both the British Social Anthropology and the American Cultural Anthropology traditions, producing a hybrid "Socio-cultural" anthropology.

==== George Mercer Dawson ====
True anthropology began with a [[Government agency|Government department]]: the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], and [[George Mercer Dawson]] (director in 1895). Dawson's support for anthropology created impetus for the profession in Canada. This was expanded upon by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who established a Division of Anthropology within the Geological Survey in 1910.

==== Edward Sapir ====
Anthropologists were recruited from England and the USA, setting the foundation for the unique Canadian style of anthropology. Scholars include the linguist and Boasian [[Edward Sapir]].

===France===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
Anthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions, in part because many French writers influential in anthropology have been trained or held faculty positions in sociology, philosophy, or other fields rather than in anthropology.

==== Marcel Mauss ====
Most commentators consider [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872–1950), nephew of the influential sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss belonged to Durkheim's ''[[Année Sociologique]]'' group. While Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Robert Hertz]]) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies that were not as 'differentiated' as European nation states.

Two works by Mauss in particular proved to have enduring relevance: ''[[The Gift (book)|Essay on the Gift]],'' a seminal analysis of [[trade|exchange]] and [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], and his Huxley lecture on the notion of the person, the first comparative study of notions of person and selfhood cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;Mauss, Marcel (1938) "A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self", in M. Carrithers, S. Collins, and S. Lukes, eds. ''The Category of the Person: anthropology, philosophy, history''. Pp. 1-25. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press. Originally given as "Une categorie de l'Esprit Humain: La Notion de Personne, Celle de 'Moi'", for the Huxley Memorial Lecture and appeared in the ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as [[surrealism]] and [[primitivism (art movement)|primitivism]], which drew on ethnography for inspiration. [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Michel Leiris]] are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as ''ethnologie'' was restricted to museums, such as the [[Musée de l'Homme]] founded by [[Paul Rivet]], and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of [[folklore]].

==== Claude Lévi-Strauss ====
Above all, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] helped institutionalize anthropology in France. Along with the enormous influence that his theory of [[structuralism]] exerted across multiple disciplines, Lévi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time, he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology, while training influential students such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Françoise Héritier]]. They proved influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France's anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally funded research laboratories ([[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]) rather than academic departments in universities

Other influential writers in the 1970s include [[Pierre Clastres]], who explains in his books on the [[Guayakis|Guayaki]] tribe in [[Paraguay]] that "primitive societies" actively oppose the institution of the [[state (polity)|state]]. These stateless societies are not less evolved than societies with states, but chose to conjure the institution of [[authority]] as a separate function from society. The [[Leadership|leader]] is only a spokesperson for the group when it has to deal with other groups ("international relations") but has no inside authority, and may be violently removed if he attempts to abuse this position.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew Dean "Critical Re-vision: Clastres' Chronicle and the optic of [[primitivism]]", 2002 In ''Best of Anthropology Today, 1974–2000'', ed. J. Benthall, with a preface by M. Sahlins. London: Routledge. [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0415262550 Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important French social theorist since [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and Lévi-Strauss is [[Pierre Bourdieu]], who trained formally in philosophy and sociology and eventually held the Chair of Sociology at the Collège de France. Like Mauss and others before him, he worked on topics both in sociology and anthropology. His fieldwork among the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] of Algeria places him solidly in anthropology, while his analysis of the function and reproduction of fashion and cultural capital in European societies places him as solidly in sociology.

===United States===
From its beginnings in the early 19th century through the early 20th century, anthropology in the United States was influenced by the presence of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] societies. [[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franz Boas]], one of the pioneers of modern anthropology, often called the "Father of American Anthropology"]]
[[Cultural anthropology]] in the United States was influenced greatly by the ready availability of Native American societies as ethnographic subjects. The field was pioneered by staff of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the Smithsonian Institution's [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], men such as [[John Wesley Powell]] and [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]].

Late-eighteenth-century ethnology established the scientific foundation for the field, which began to mature in the United States during the presidency of [[Andrew Jackson]] (1829–1837). Jackson was responsible for implementing the Indian Removal Act, the coerced and forced removal of an estimated 100,000 American Indians during the 1830s to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma; for insuring that the franchise was extended to all white men, irrespective of financial means while denying virtually all black men the right to vote; and, for suppressing abolitionists' efforts to end slavery while vigorously defending that institution. Finally, he was responsible for appointing Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] who would decide, in Scott v. Sandford (1857), that Negroes were "beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race&amp;nbsp;... and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect". As a result of this decision, black people, whether free or enslaved, could never become citizens of the United States.

It was in this context that the so-called American School of Anthropology thrived as the champion of polygenism or the doctrine of multiple origins—sparking a debate between those influenced by the Bible who believed in the unity of humanity and those who argued from a scientific standpoint for the plurality of origins and the antiquity of distinct types. Like the monogenists, these theories were not monolithic and often used words like races, species, hybrid, and mongrel interchangeably. A scientific consensus began to emerge during this period "that there exists a Genus Homo, embracing many primordial types of 'species'". [[Charles Caldwell (physician)|Charles Caldwell]], [[Samuel George Morton]], [[Samuel A. Cartwright]], [[George Gliddon]], [[Josiah C. Nott]], and [[Louis Agassiz]], and even South Carolina Governor [[James Henry Hammond]] were all influential proponents of this school. While some were disinterested scientists, others were passionate advocates who used science to promote slavery in a period of increasing sectional strife. All were complicit in establishing the putative science that justified slavery, informed the Dred Scott decision, underpinned miscegenation laws, and eventually fueled Jim Crow. Samuel G. Morton, for example, claimed to be just a scientist but he did not hesitate to provide evidence of Negro inferiority to John C. Calhoun, the prominent pro-slavery Secretary of State to help him negotiate the annexation of Texas as a slave state.

The high-water mark of polygenic theories was Josiah Nott and Gliddon's voluminous eight-hundred page tome titled ''Types of Mankind'', published in 1854. Reproducing the work of Louis Agassiz and Samuel Morton, the authors spread the virulent and explicitly racist views to a wider, more popular audience. The first printing sold out quickly and by the end of the century it had undergone nine editions. Although many Southerners felt that all the justification for slavery they needed was found in the Bible, others used the new science to defend slavery and the repression of American Indians. Abolitionists, however, felt they had to take this science on its own terms. And for the first time, African American intellectuals waded into the contentious debate. In the immediate wake of Types of Mankind and during the pitched political battles that led to Civil War, [[Frederick Douglass]] (1818–1895), the statesman and persuasive abolitionist, directly attacked the leading theorists of the American School of Anthropology. In an 1854 address, entitled "The Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered", Douglass argued that "by making the enslaved a character fit only for slavery, [slaveowners] excuse themselves for refusing to make the slave a freeman.... For let it be once granted that the human race are of multitudinous origin, naturally different in their moral, physical, and intellectual capacities&amp;nbsp;... a chance is left for slavery, as a necessary institution.... There is no doubt that Messrs. Nott, Glidden, Morton, Smith and Agassiz were duly consulted by our slavery propagating statesmen" (p.&amp;nbsp;287).

==== Lewis Henry Morgan in the United States====
[[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881), a lawyer from [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], became an advocate for and ethnological scholar of the [[Iroquois]]. His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology. Like other scholars of his day (such as [[Edward Tylor]]), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from ''savagery'', to ''barbarism'', to ''civilization''. He focused on understanding how cultures integrated and systematized, and how the various features of one culture indicate an evolutionary status in comparison with other cultures. Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale.

==== Franz Boas ====
[[Franz Boas]] established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to this sort of evolutionary perspective. His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws. For example, Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature.

Influenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct ''cultures,'' rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little "civilization" they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the [[natural science]]s, were not possible.

In doing so, he fought discrimination against immigrants, blacks, and indigenous peoples of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) ''Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology''. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many American anthropologists adopted his agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular subjects for anthropologists today. The so-called "Four Field Approach" has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and archaic anthropology (e.g. archaeology). Anthropology in the United States continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture.
[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|[[Ruth Benedict]] in 1937]]

Boas used his positions at [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages helped establish [[linguistics]] as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on [[Indo-European languages]].

The publication of [[Alfred Kroeber]]'s textbook, ''Anthropology,'' marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists including [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up.

Though such works as ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' and ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by [[Ralph Linton]], and Mead was limited to her offices at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]].

===Other countries===
Anthropology as it emerged amongst the Western colonial powers (mentioned above) has generally taken a different path than that in the countries of southern and central Europe ([[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the successors to the [[Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman empire]]s). In the former, the encounter with multiple, distinct cultures, often very different in organization and language from those of Europe, has led to a continuing emphasis on [[cross-cultural comparison]] and a receptiveness to certain kinds of cultural relativism.&lt;ref name="Spiro1987"&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) "Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason", in ''Culture and Human Nature: theoretical papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp. 32–58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the successor states of continental Europe, on the other hand, anthropologists often joined with folklorists and linguists in building cultural perspectives on nationalism. Ethnologists in these countries tended to focus on differentiating among local ethnolinguistic groups, documenting local folk culture, and representing the prehistory of what has become a nation through various forms of public education (e.g., museums of several kinds).&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest. (1998) ''Language and solitude: Wittgenstein, Malinowski, and the Habsburg dilemma''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scheme, Russia occupied a middle position. On the one hand, it had a large region (largely east of the Urals) of highly distinct, pre-industrial, often non-literate peoples, similar to the situation in the Americas. On the other hand, Russia also participated to some degree in the nationalist (cultural and political) movements of Central and Eastern Europe. After the Revolution of 1917, views expressed by anthropologists in the USSR, and later the Soviet Bloc countries, were highly shaped by the requirement to conform to Marxist theories of social evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest, ed. (1980) ''Soviet and Western anthropology''. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece, there was since the 19th century a science of the [[folklore]] called ''laographia'' (laography), in the form of "a science of the interior", although theoretically weak; but the connotation of the field deeply changed after World War II, when a wave of Anglo-American anthropologists introduced a science "of the outside".&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Zoïa, "L'anthropologie en Grèce", Terrain, Numéro 14—L'incroyable et ses preuves (mars 1990), [En ligne], mis en ligne le 7 octobre 2005, [http://terrain.revues.org/document3641.html Terrain.revues.org], Consulté le 15 juin 2007. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Italy, the development of [[ethnology]] and related studies did not receive as much attention as other branches of learning&lt;ref&gt;Grottanelli, Vinigi ''Ethnology and/or Cultural Anthropology in Italy: Traditions and Developments (and Comments and Reply)''. Other authors: Giorgio Ausenda, Bernardo Bernardi, Ugo Bianchi, [[Y. Michal Bodemann]], Jack Goody, Allison Jablonko, David I. Kertzer, Vittorio Lanternari, Antonio Marazzi, Roy A. Miller, Jr., Laura Laurencich Minelli, David M. Moss, Leonard W. Moss, H. R. H. Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark, Diana Pinto, Pietro Scotti, Tullio Tentori. ''[[Current Anthropology]]'', Vol. 18, No. 4 (December, 1977), pp. 593–614 {{jstor|2741501}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but nonetheless included important researchers and thinkers like [[Ernesto De Martino]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bookrags.com/research/de-martino-ernesto-eorl-04/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] and [[Norway]] are the countries that showed the most division and conflict between scholars focusing on domestic socio-cultural issues and scholars focusing on "other" societies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. Some German and Austrian scholars have increased cultural anthropology as both legal anthropology regarding "other" societies and anthropology of Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Fikentscher: "Law and Anthropology: Outlines, Issues, and Suggestions", Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, C.H.

The development of [[World Anthropologies|world anthropologies]] has followed different trajectories.

==20th-century developments==
In the mid-20th century, American anthropology began to study its own history more systematically. In 1967 [[Marvin Harris]] published his ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'', presenting argumentative examinations of anthropology's historical developments, and [[George W. Stocking, Jr.]], established the historicist school, examining the historical contexts of anthropological movements.

A '''hoax''' is a falsehood deliberately fabricated to masquerade as the truth. It is distinguishable from errors in observation or judgment,&lt;ref name=MacDougall_6&gt;{{cite book | title = Hoaxes | first = Curtis D. | last = MacDougall | isbn = 0-486-20465-0 | publisher = Dover | page = 6 | year = 1958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[rumor]]s, [[urban legend]]s, [[pseudoscience]]s, and [[April Fools' Day]] events that are passed along in [[good faith]] by believers or as jokes.&lt;ref name=Brunvand_194&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Urban Legends | first = Jan H. | last = Brunvand | authorlink = Jan Harold Brunvand | isbn = 1-57607-076-X | page = 194 | publisher = W.

==History==
{{see also|History of propaganda}} 
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}

Although [[practical joke]]s have likely existed for thousands of years, one of the earliest recorded hoaxes in history was the [[drummer of Tedworth]] in 1661.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WaT5XC9BptIC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=earliest%20historical%20recorded%20hoax&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=%22earliest%20known%20hoaxes%22&amp;f=false|title=Paranormal Nation: Why America Needs Ghosts, UFOs, and Bigfoot|first=Marc E.|last=Fitch|date=21 March 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The communication of hoaxes can be accomplished in almost any manner that a fictional story can be communicated:  in person, via [[word of mouth]], via words printed on paper, and so on.  As the [[communications technology|technology of communication]] has advanced, the speed at which hoaxes spread has also advanced:  a rumor about a ghostly drummer, spread by word of mouth, will impact a relatively small area at first, then grow gradually.  However, hoaxes could also be spread via [[chain letters]], which became easier as the cost of mailing a letter dropped.  The invention of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century brought down the cost of a mass-produced books and pamphlets, and the [[rotary printing press]] of the 19th century reduced the price even further (see [[yellow journalism]]).  During the 20th century, the hoax found a mass market in the form of [[supermarket tabloid]]s, and by the 21st century there were [[fake news website]]s which spread hoaxes via [[social networking]] websites (in addition to the use of email for a modern type of [[chain letter]]).

==Etymology==
The English [[philologist]] [[Robert Nares]] (1753–1829) says that the word ''hoax'' was coined in the late 18th century as a contraction of the verb ''[[wiktionary:hocus|hocus]]'', which means "to cheat," "to impose upon"&lt;ref name="Nares1822"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nares|first=Robert |title=A glossary; or, Collection of words ... which have been thought to require illustration, in the works of English authors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjITAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=235|year=1822|publisher=R. Triphook|location=London|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; or (according to Merrian-Webster) "to befuddle often with drugged liquor."&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{cite web | title = Merriam-Webster Dictionary: Hocus | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hocus?show=0&amp;t=1288021817 | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | year = 2010 | accessdate = 25 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hocus'' is a shortening of the [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] [[incantation]] ''[[Hocus Pocus (magic)|hocus pocus]]'',&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; whose origin is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Hocus Pocus (magic)|Hocus Pocus]] article for more detail.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2017}}

==Definition==
[[File:Candle in the Dark by Thomas Ady.gif|thumb|[[Thomas Ady]]'s ''A candle in the dark ...'' (1656) contains one of the earliest mentions of ''[[Hocus Pocus (magic)|hocus pocus]]'', the origin of the word ''hoax''.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite book | title = More Word Histories and Mysteries: From Aardvark to Zombie | author = Editors of the American Heritage Dictionaries | page = 110 | isbn = 0-618-71681-5 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Feejee mermaid.jpg|thumb|upright|[[P. T. Barnum]]'s [[Fiji mermaid]] (1842)]]

[[Robert Nares]] defined the word ''hoax'' as meaning "to cheat," dating from [[Thomas Ady]]'s 1656 book ''A candle in the dark, or a treatise on the nature of witches and [[witchcraft]]''.&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt;

The term ''hoax'' is occasionally used in reference to urban legends and rumors, but the [[folklorist]] [[Jan Harold Brunvand]] argues that most of them lack evidence of deliberate creations of falsehood and are passed along in good faith by believers or as jokes, so the term should be used for only those with a probable conscious attempt to deceive.&lt;ref name=Brunvand_194/&gt; As for the closely related terms ''[[practical joke]]'' and ''prank'', Brunvand states that although there are instances where they overlap, ''hoax'' tends to indicate "relatively complex and large-scale fabrications" and includes deceptions that go beyond the merely playful and "cause material loss or harm to the victim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = American Folklore: An Encyclopedia | first = Jan H. | last = Brunvand | authorlink = Jan Harold Brunvand | isbn = 0-8153-3350-1 | page = 587 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor Lynda Walsh of the [[University of Nevada, Reno]], some hoaxes—such as the [[Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814]], labeled as a hoax by contemporary commentators—are financial in nature, and successful hoaxers—such as [[P. T. Barnum]], whose [[Fiji mermaid]] contributed to his wealth—often acquire monetary gain or fame through their fabrications, so the distinction between ''hoax'' and ''[[fraud]]'' is not necessarily clear.&lt;ref name=Walsh_24&gt;{{cite book | title = Sins Against Science: The Scientific Media Hoaxes of Poe, Twain, And Others | first = Lynda | last = Walsh | publisher = State University of New York Press | isbn = 0-7914-6877-1 | pages = 24–25 | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Boese, the creator of the [[Museum of Hoaxes]], states that the only distinction between them is the reaction of the public, because a fraud can be classified as a hoax when its method of acquiring financial gain creates a broad public impact or captures the imagination of the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What Is A Hoax? | first = Alex | last = Boese | year = 2008 | url = http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Hoaxipedia/What_is_a_hoax/ | accessdate = 25 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest recorded media hoaxes is a fake [[almanac]] published by [[Jonathan Swift]] under the pseudonym of [[Isaac Bickerstaff]] in 1708.&lt;ref name=Walsh_17&gt;{{cite book | title = Sins Against Science: The Scientific Media Hoaxes of Poe, Twain, And Others | first = Lynda | last = Walsh | publisher = State University of New York Press | isbn = 0-7914-6877-1 | pages = 17–18 | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swift predicted the death of [[John Partridge (astrologer)|John Partridge]], one of the leading astrologers in England at that time, in the almanac and later issued an [[elegy]] on the day Partridge was supposed to have died. Partridge's reputation was damaged as a result and his astrological almanac was not published for the next six years.&lt;ref name=Walsh_17/&gt;

It is possible to perpetrate a hoax by making only true statements using unfamiliar wording or context, such as in the [[Dihydrogen monoxide hoax]]. Political hoaxes are sometimes motivated by the desire to ridicule or besmirch opposing politicians or [[political institution]]s, often before elections.

A hoax differs from a [[magic (illusion)|magic]] trick or from [[fiction]] (books, [[movies]], [[theatre]], [[radio]], [[television]], etc.) in that the audience is unaware of being deceived, whereas in watching a magician perform an illusion the audience expects to be tricked.

A hoax is often intended as a practical joke or to cause embarrassment, or to provoke social or political change by raising people's awareness of something. It can also emerge from a marketing or advertising purpose. For example, to market a [[romantic comedy]] movie, a director staged a phony "incident" during a supposed [[wedding]], which showed a bride and preacher getting knocked into a pool by a clumsy fall from a best man.&lt;ref name=twsMarE28/&gt; A resulting video clip of ''Chloe and Keith's Wedding'' was uploaded to [[YouTube]] and was viewed by over 30 million people and the couple was interviewed by numerous talk shows.&lt;ref name=twsMarE28/&gt; Viewers were deluded into thinking that it was an authentic clip of a real accident at a real wedding; but a story in ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2009 revealed it was a hoax.&lt;ref name=twsMarE28&gt;{{cite news
 |author= Oldenburg, Ann
 |title= Director: 'Chloe and Keith's Wedding' video is a hoax
 |publisher= ''USA Today''
 |quote= But today, we can tell you: it's definitely a hoax. Chloe and Keith are actors named Josh Covitt and Charissa Wheeler. They're not married.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments sometimes spread false information to facilitate their objectives, such as going to war.  These often come under the heading of black propaganda. There is often a mixture of outright hoax and [[Censorship|suppression and management of information]] to give the desired impression. In wartime and times of international tension rumors abound, some of which may be deliberate hoaxes.

Examples of politics-related hoaxes:
* [[Belgium]] is a country with a [[Flemish]]-speaking region and a [[French language|French]]-speaking region. In 2006 French-speaking television channel [[RTBF]] interrupted programming with [[Flemish Secession hoax|a spoof report]] claiming that the country had split in two and the [[Monarchy of Belgium|royal family]] had fled.
* On Saturday 13 March 2010 the [[Imedi]] television station in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] broadcast [[Imedi Media Holding#2010 Russian invasion hoax|a false announcement]] that [[Russia]] had invaded Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Ivan|title=Fake Russian invasion broadcast sparks Georgian panic|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/03/14/georgia.invasion.scare/|accessdate=12 December 2016|publisher=CNN|date=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Peter Hancock has identified six steps which characterise a truly successful hoax:&lt;ref name=hancock15&gt;{{cite book | title = Hoax Springs Eternal: The Psychology of Cognitive Deception | first = Peter | last = Hancock | publisher = Cambridge U.P. | isbn = 9781107417687 | pages = 182–195 | year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify a constituency- a person or group of people who, for reasons such as piety or patriotism, or greed, will truly care about your creation.
* Identify a particular dream which will make your hoax appeal to your constituency.
* Create an appealing but "under-specified" hoax, with ambiguities
* Have your creation discovered.
* Find at least one champion who will actively support your hoax.
* Make people care, either positively or negatively – the ambiguities encourage interest and debate

==Types==
[[File:Disinformation vs Misinformation.jpg|thumb|300px|Graphic showing differences between [[misinformation]], [[disinformation]], and hoax, presented for [[mw:Wikimedia Research/Showcase#November 2015|Wikimedia Research]] (2015)]]

Hoaxes vary widely in their processes of creation, propagation, and entrenchment over time. Examples include:
*[[List of scholarly publishing hoaxes|Academic hoaxes]]
*[[List of religious hoaxes|Religious hoaxes]]
*Hoaxes perpetrated on occasions when their initiation is considered socially appropriate, such as [[April Fools' Day]]
*Criminal Hoaxing, such as the case of John Samuel Humble, aka [[Wearside Jack]]. Criminal hoaxing diverts time and money of police investigations with communications purporting to come from the actual criminal. Once caught, hoaxers are charged under criminal codes such as [[Perverting the course of justice]].
*Anthropologists were taken in by the "[[Piltdown Man]] discovery" that was widely believed from 1913 to 1953
*[[Apocryphal]] claims that originate as a hoax gain widespread belief among members of a culture or organization, become entrenched as persons who believe it repeat it in [[good faith]] to others, and continue to command that belief after the hoax's originators have died or departed
*Hoaxes formed by making minor or gradually increasing changes to a warning or other claim widely circulated for legitimate purposes
*Hoaxes perpetrated by "scare tactics" appealing to the audience's subjectively rational belief that the expected cost of not believing the hoax (the cost if its assertions are true times the likelihood of their truth) outweighs the expected cost of believing the hoax (cost if false times likelihood of falsity), such as claims that a non-malicious but unfamiliar program on one's computer is [[malware]]
*Some [[urban legend]]s and rumors with a probable conscious attempt to deceive&lt;ref name=Brunvand_194/&gt;
*[[Humbug]]s
*Computer [[virus hoax]]es became widespread as [[Computer virus|viruses]] themselves began to spread. A typical hoax is an [[email]] message warning recipients of a non-existent threat, usually forging quotes supposedly from authorities such as [[Microsoft]] and [[IBM]]. In most cases the [[payload (software)|payload]] is an exhortation to distribute the message to everyone in the recipient's [[Software address book|address book]]. Thus the e-mail "warning" is itself the "virus." Sometimes the hoax is more harmful, e.g., telling the recipient to seek a particular [[computer file|file]] (usually in a [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]); if the file is found, the computer is deemed to be infected unless it is deleted. In reality the file is one required by the operating system for correct functioning of the computer.
*[[Internet]] hoaxes became more common after the start of [[social media]]. Some websites have been used to hoax millions of people on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/24/how-serial-hoaxers-duped-the-internet-with-fake-4chan-threats-against-emma-watson/ |title=How serial hoaxers duped the Internet |publisher=Washington Post |date=2014-09-24 |accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[List of hoaxes#Proven hoaxes of exposure|hoax of exposure]] is a semi-comical or private [[sting operation]]. It usually encourages people to act foolishly or credulously by falling for patent nonsense that the hoaxer deliberately presents as reality. A related activity is [[culture jamming]].
*Art-world hoaxes:
**The "Bruno Hat" art hoax, arranged in [[London]] in July 1929, involved staging a convincing public exhibition of [[paintings]] by an imaginary reclusive artist, Bruno Hat. All the perpetrators were well-educated and did not intend a fraud, as the newspapers were informed the next day. Those involved included [[Brian Howard (poet)|Brian Howard]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne|Bryan Guinness]], [[John Banting]] and [[Thomas David Freeman-Mitford|Tom Mitford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leicestergalleries.com/19th-20th-century-paintings/d/still-life-with-pears/10464 |title=Leicester Galleries website on '&amp;#39;Bruno Hat'&amp;#39;, accessed 28th May 2011 |publisher=Leicestergalleries.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''[[Nat Tate: An American Artist 1928-1960]]'': a 1998 art world hoax, by [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]]
** [[Disumbrationism]]: a modern art hoax
** [[Pierre Brassau]]: exposing art critics to "modern paintings" made by a chimpanzee
** ''[[Spectra (book)|Spectra: A Book of Poetic Experiments]]'': a modernist poetry hoax
** [[Ern Malley]], the popular but fictitious [[Australian]] poet.

The '''International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion''' ('''IACSR'''), founded in 2006, is a scholarly association dedicated to the promotion of the [[Cognitive Science of Religion]]. The IACSR is an interdisciplinary association, including scholars from a wide variety of disciplines in the human, social, natural and health sciences that are interested in the academic, scientific study of religious phenomena. The IACSR seeks to advance the naturalistic study of religion. It is strictly scientific and does not encourage or welcome those who are interested in dialogue between science and religion, attempt to find religion in science and science in religion, or attempt to validate religious or spiritual doctrines through cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;[[IACSR]] as cited in {{cite web |url=http://www.iacsr.com/Home.html |title=IACSR-Home |accessdate=2008-08-08 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IACSR supports the ''Electronic Archive for Religion &amp; Cognition'' at the ''Centre for Religion &amp; Cognition'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religionandcognition.com/crc/|title=Centre for Religion &amp; Cognition|last=|first=|date=|website=www.religionandcognition.com/crc|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groningen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csr-arc.com|title=Archive for Religion &amp; Cognition|date=|website=www.csr-arc.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Journal of Cognition &amp; Culture'' ([[Brill Publishers]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brill.nl/jocc|title=Journal of Cognition and Culture {{!}} Brill|website=www.brill.nl|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two book series, ''Scientific Studies of Religion: Inquiry and Explanation'' ([http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/series/scientific-studies-of-religion-inquiry-and-explanation/ Bloomsbury Academic]), which was formerly the series ''Cognitive Science of Religion'' ([[AltaMira Press]]), and ''Religion, Cognition and Culture'' (Equinox Press).

Erich Kahler, a scholar, author, and lecturer, arrived in Princeton in 1939 as a financially destitute Jewish refugee from the Nazi regime. One Evelyn Place welcomed Jewish intellectual refugees from Europe and was filled with visitors, boarders, and cultural conversation. The Einstein family, the Thomas Mann family, and [[Hermann Broch]] were close friends of the Kahlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=F.

'''Kazakh clothing''', worn by the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] people, is often made of materials suited to the region's extreme climate and the people's nomadic lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Coming of Age"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jAu9ttUqiJoC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=clothing+kazakhstan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=37nZUdv_EKWPyAGcsoGYAQ&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBDgK#v=snippet&amp;q=clothing%20&amp;f=false] Fergus, Michael and Jandosova, Janar, "Kazakhstan: Coming of Age," Stacey International, 2003, page 216. {{ISBN|978-1900988612}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly decorated with elaborate ornaments made from bird beaks, animal horns, hooves and feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kazakhembus.com/content/kazakh-traditional-clothing-past-and-present|title=Loading site please wait...|website=www.kazakhembus.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although contemporary Kazakhs usually wear Western dress, the [[Turkic people]] wear more traditional clothing for holidays and special occasions.&lt;ref name=Pictures&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8rd4LRKrdUC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=clothing+kazakhstan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1MbZUcv7F6OWyAGCtYHgAg&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=clothing%20&amp;f=false] Waters, Bella "Kazakhstan in Pictures,"  Twenty First Century Books; 2nd edition, 2007, page 37. {{ISBN|978-0822565888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials and production methods==
Traditional materials used in Kazakh clothing include [[cloth]], [[hide (skin)|skin]], [[felt]], and [[fur clothing|fur]]. [[Embroidery]], fur, [[jewelry]], and ornamentation may also be used for decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://astanatimes.com/2016/05/kazakh-traditional-clothing-past-and-present/|title=Kazakh Traditional Clothing: Past and Present|last=|first=|date=17 May 2016|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imported materials such as [[silk]], [[brocade]], and [[velvet]] can also be used for clothing, but are more expensive than traditional materials.

[[File:Camel shedding hair.jpg|thumb|alt=A man shears a camel, surrounded by other camels|A Bactrian camel has its hair sheared for clothing.]]
Traditional materials, such as [[horsehair]], [[List of types of fur#Fox|fox fur]], sheep's wool and rabbit hides, are used in the production of clothing. Preparation of the materials includes skinning, drying, and greasing the hides with a mixture of sour milk and flour. After four days, the skins are washed and soaked in a concentrated [[brine]]. After more drying, the underside of the hide is scraped with a skinning knife before being heated; this gives the skin its whitish color. The fur is then ready for dyeing in a variety of colors. Yellow dye is made from the crushed root of the Taranovy plant. Red dye is made from the root of ''Uiran Boyau,'' and orange dye is often made from dried [[pomegranate]] crusts.

Kazakhs often use white wool, and consider wool from the neck of a sheep valuable. The hair of the [[Bactrian camel]] is also used for more luxurious clothing. An [[Fur#Composition|undercoat]], collected after the camel has [[Moulting|molted]], it is considered particularly valuable.
 
Imported [[cotton]], silk, and woolen fabrics were used by Kazakh [[nomad]]s. The feudal nobility used imported fabrics to make their clothing; less-affluent Kazakhs wore more easily accessible materials, such as furs, leather, and homemade wool. Fabrics were home-spun on a primitive, horizontal [[loom]].

Women wear a shirt-like garment known as a ''koylek''. Different fabrics are used, with more-expensive fabrics for festive wear and common fabrics for everyday use. The ''koylek'' is made by folding a piece of fabric in half and sewing the sides from the armpits to the bottom hem.

A ''koylek'' usually worn by unmarried Kazakh girls is typically made from a light, soft fabric which accentuates the waist. ''Kunikey'' means "sun-like" in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], and the word is used to describe this type of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bukhara-carpets.com/kazakh_traditional_costumes.html|title=Kazakhstan Traditional Costumes and Clothing - Garments, Dress, Headgear, Footwear|website=www.bukhara-carpets.com|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kazakh girls wear trousers made of sheepskin, homespun cloth, and heavy cotton fabrics. They may be short (''shalbar'') or long (''dalbar'').

A ''kupe'' is a coat worn by women and men which is typically made of fox fur or, occasionally, [[goatskin (material)|goatskin]]. It is usually lined with camel or sheep wool and hemmed with otter fur on the sleeves for warmth during early spring and fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bukhara-carpets.com/kazakh_traditional_costumes.html|title=Kazakhstan Traditional Costumes and Clothing - Garments, Dress, Headgear, Footwear|website=www.bukhara-carpets.com|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman's ''kupe'' is distinguishable from a man's by its embroidered collar.

A staple article of Kazakh clothing is the [[chapan]] or ''shapan'', a long, loose robe.&lt;ref name="CentralAsia"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7qEgs9ZL7LgC&amp;pg=PT252&amp;dq=clothing+kazakhstan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fMnZUcDiEYLJywGV8oGADQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAjgo] Hanks, Reuel R., "Central Asia: a global studies handbook," ABC-CLIO,  2005, page 232. {{ISBN|978-1851096565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other clothing, it is not gender-specific and is worn by men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/543|title=Shapan (the dressing gown)|date=August 8, 2014|website=National Digital History of Kazakhstan|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapans are made from various fabrics and are available in a range of colors (most often monochrome or dark). They are lined with a layer of wool or cotton. Festive velvet chapans are decorated with [[appliqué]], brushing, and gold embroidery. This type of robe was worn by wealthy Kazakhs.

A ''syrmaly'' is a hapan which is quilted and strengthened with denser fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bukhara-carpets.com/kazakh_traditional_costumes.html|title=Kazakhstan Traditional Costumes and Clothing - Garments, Dress, Headgear, Footwear|website=www.bukhara-carpets.com|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''kaptal'' is a lined chapan, and a ''shabu'' is a chapan trimmed with fur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bukhara-carpets.com/kazakh_traditional_costumes.html|title=Kazakhstan Traditional Costumes and Clothing - Garments, Dress, Headgear, Footwear|website=www.bukhara-carpets.com|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Female headgear|Brides|Childbirth}}Headgear===

[[Headgear]] indicate a woman's relationship status. Unmarried girls wear a skullcap scarf and a warm, fur-edged cap. Wealthier girls' hats are made of bright velvet fabric and embroidered with golden thread.

Bridal headgear of a bride is a ''saukele.'' These headdresses, often over a foot tall, are embedded with valuable ornaments such as pearls, coral, and pressed silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakh Saukele (female wedding headdress: from Sakas to Kazakhs through millenniums)|url=http://www.kunstkamera.ru/en/temporary_exhibitions/in_house_exhibitions/archive_2/kazakh_saukele/|website=Kunstkamera|publisher=Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long suspension brackets, ''zhaktau'', are fastened to the sides of the ''saukele'' and frame the bride's face. They sometimes reach the bride's waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Kazakh Wear|url=http://visitkazakhstan.kz/en/about/77/|website=Visit Kazakhstan|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less prosperous women make the ''saukele'' from cloth or satin and decorate it with glass beads; the ''zhaktau'' are added later.

After the birth of her first child, a woman wears a hat made of white fabric (often for the rest of her life). The details of the hat vary by region to region. It has two parts; the bottom (''kimeshka'') is placed on the head and the top is twisted to form a [[turban]].

=={{anchor|Male apparel|Shalbar|Camisole|-Zhargak shapa|Ton}}Men's clothing==
[[File:Kazakh Clothing (10368357).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Embroidered vests and hats|Traditional Kazakh men's clothing]]
Men wear two types of skin shirts (without an [[undershirt]]), inner and outer trousers and loose-fitting robes made from various materials and belted with leather or cloth. During the 18th century, the top trousers (''shalbar'') were sewn from homespun [[camel hair]] fabric and skin. They had embroidered silk patterns in vegetable shapes, the ends often sheathed by an ornate band and [[lace]] and edged with fur.

Jackets were sewn from monochrome dark (occasionally multicolored) fabrics. They had a cloth lining, often insulated with a thin layer of wool. Popular among young Kazakh men, the ''zhargak shapa'' is decorated with traditional patterns and worn on important occasions.

A coat (''ton'') is often made of sheepskin, but may be made from the skin of raccoons (''janat ishik'') or silver foxes (''kara tulki''). Nobles often wear ''kok ton'', fur coats made from blue cloth covered (and trimmed) with beaver skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kazakh national costume reflects the ancient traditions associated with their ethnic history, economic, social and climatic conditions|url=http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/347|website=National Digital History of Kazakhstan|accessdate=24 February 2017|date=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tons'' are often made by sewing together tanned sheepskins with wool on the inside; more prosperous Kazakhs wear ''tons'' made from the wool of four- to five-month-old lambs.

=== {{anchor|Male headgear|Aiyr Kalpak|Borik|Tymak|Kulapara|Takiya}}Headgear ===
[[File:Kazakh Eagle Hunters.JPG|thumb|alt=Mounted hunters in traditional dress|Kazakh hunters with eagles]]
An ''aiyr kalpak'' is a pointed, upturned cap, usually worn by the upper class.&lt;ref name=costumes&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bukhara-carpets.com/kazakh_traditional_costumes.html|title=Kazakhstan Traditional Costumes and Clothing - Garments, Dress, Headgear, Footwear|website=www.bukhara-carpets.com|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fabric cap is decorated with unique, ornamental patterns to indicate wealth, power and social status.

{{Feminism sidebar |Variants (general)}}

'''Lipstick feminism''' is a variety of [[third-wave feminism]] that seeks to embrace traditional concepts of femininity, including the [[Sexual attraction|sexual power]] of women, alongside feminist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Lankford, ''Women Singer-Songwriters in Rock'' (2010) p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike early feminist campaigns that focused on the basic fundamental [[rights of women]], starting with the [[Women's Suffrage]] Movement, lipstick feminism seeks to ascertain that women could still be feminist without ignoring or negating their femininity, particularly in terms of sexuality. During the [[second wave of feminism]], feminists had focused solely on legal and social equality of women and refused to 'embrace' their sexuality; some even abhorred the idea of men and would often take on physical characteristics and persona that was far from what the average woman looked like, thus creating stereotypes of what feminism and feminists looked like. Lipstick feminism, on the other hand, embraces the concepts of womanhood and the female sexuality emitted from a woman's body and the need to embrace sex. Lipstick feminism also seeks to reclaim certain derogatory words and turn them into powerful tools for their cause such as the word 'slut' as seen in the [[SlutWalk]] movement. It developed in part as a response to the [[Ideology|ideological]] backlash against radical varieties of [[second-wave feminism]], with the negative stereotypes it generated of the “ugly feminist” or the “anti-sex feminist”; in part the result of the belief that the successes of second-wave feminism had made it possible to reclaim aspects of femininity that had earlier been seen as disempowering, like make-up or stilettos.&lt;ref&gt;Natasha Walters, ''Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism'' (2010) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==

Linguistically, lipstick feminism proposed to [[semantics|semantically]] reclaim, for feminist usage, double-standard insult words, such as “slut”,&lt;ref name=wisegeek&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-lipstick-feminism.htm What is Lipstick Feminism]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to eliminate the [[social stigma]] applied to a woman whose sexual behaviour was "[[Patriarchy|patriarchically]]" interpreted to denote “immoral woman” and [[libertine]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Hollows/R. Mosely eds., ''Feminism in Popular Culture'' (2006) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Philosophically, lipstick feminism proposes that a woman can be [[Power (philosophy)|empowered]] — psychologically, socially, politically – by the wearing of [[make up|cosmetic make up]], sensually-appealing clothes, and the embrace of sexual allure for her own self-image as a confidently sexual being. The rhetoric of choice and empowerment is used to validate such overt sexual practices,&lt;ref&gt;Walters, p. 28 and p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; because they no longer represent coerced acquiescence to societally established [[gender role]]s, such as “the good girl”, “the decent woman”, “the abnegated mother”, “the virtuous sister”, ''et aliæ''.

Other feminists object that the so-called empowerment of lipstick feminism is a philosophic contradiction wherein a woman chooses to sexually objectify herself, and so ceases to be her own woman, in control neither of her self nor of her person.&lt;ref name=wisegeek/&gt; In an ongoing debate, lipstick feminism counter-proposes that the practice of sexual allure is a form of social [[Power (sociology)|power]] in the [[interpersonal relations]] between a man and a woman, which may occur in the realms of cultural, social, and gender equality.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Stiletto feminism===
Stiletto feminism, a more ideologically radical variety of lipstick feminism, sees the [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] use of [[fetish fashion]] as empowering;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruthpadel.com/uncategorized/helmut-newton-and-stiletto-feminism/ Helmut Newton and Stiletto Feminism]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and extends the argument from the acceptance of makeup, to the validity of women practicing occupations specifically predicated upon female [[Beauty|physical beauty]], such as working as a [[Striptease|striptease dancer]] or as a [[pole dancing|pole dancer]], as well as [[Exhibitionism|flashing]] or lesbian (girl-on-girl) exhibitionism.

== In popular culture ==
* In the U.S. television series, ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', the 57th episode, “[[Night Five]]”, features a scene wherein the characters debate the merits of lipstick feminism. The female protagonist decides it is empowering, while determining that sex-negativism distracts from important issues like pay equity and "honest-to-God sexual harassment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The West Wing Continuity Guide|title=#313 (57) "Night Five"

==History==
{{Expand section|date=March 2017 }}
A [[Global spread of the printing press#North America|printing press]] began operating in [[Rogersville, Tennessee|Rogersville]] in 1791.&lt;ref name=wroth1938&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/colonialprinter00wrot#page/15/mode/1up |chapter=Diffusion of Printing |title=The Colonial Printer |publisher=Southworth-Anthoensen Press |first=Lawrence C. |last=Wroth |author-link=Lawrence C.

In 1854 the [[Southern Methodist Publishing House|Methodist Publishing House]] relocated to Nashville from Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-28/business/fi-7970_1_publishing-house |title=Nashville: Publishing Bibles Is Big Business |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Charles |last=Hillinger |date=May 28, 1986 |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blodgett1997"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZLb2YQ4NCkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1 |title=Protestant Evangelical Literary Culture and Contemporary Society |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |location=Westport, Connecticut |first=Jan |last=Blodgett |series=Contributions to the Study of Religion |issue=51 |date=1997 |isbn=0-313-30395-9 |oclc=36147250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Noalles Murfree (1850–1922) published under the pseudonym "Charles Egbert Craddock". Her ''In the Tennessee Mountains'' (1884) became a bestseller, featuring "stories of the Tennessee hill country".&lt;ref name=Campbell2006&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Regionalism and Local Color Fiction |title=American History Through Literature, 1870-1920 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |location=Detroit, Michigan |first=Donna M. |last=Campbell |editor1-first=Tom |editor1-last=Quirk |editor2-first=Gary |editor2-last=Scharnhorst |volume=3 |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-684-31493-8 |oclc=62778245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo||メタルギアソリッド2　サンズ・オブ・リバティ|extra="Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty"}}}} is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[stealth game]] developed and published by [[Konami]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] in 13 November 2001. It is the fourth [[Metal Gear|''Metal Gear'' game]] written and directed by [[Hideo Kojima]] and serves as the direct sequel to the original ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]''. An expanded edition, titled '''''Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance''''', was released the following year for [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in addition to the PlayStation 2.

The story revolves around the "Big Shell", a massive offshore clean-up facility that has been seized by a group of terrorists who call themselves the "Sons of Liberty". They demand a massive ransom in exchange for the life of the President of the United States and threaten to destroy the facility and create a cataclysmic environmental disaster if their demands are not met. The motives and identities of many of the antagonists and allies change throughout the course of the game, as the protagonists discover a world-shaking conspiracy constructed by a powerful organization known as the Patriots.

While the game received acclaim for its gameplay, graphics, and its attention to detail, critics were initially divided on the protagonist and the philosophical nature and execution of the game's storyline, which explores themes such as [[memetics]], [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]], [[Conspiracy theory|political conspiracies]], [[censorship]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[existentialism]], [[postmodernism]] and [[post-truth politics]]. ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' has since been considered to be one of the [[greatest video games of all time]], as well as a leading example of [[Art game|artistic expression in video games]]. By 2003, the game had sold over seven million copies worldwide.

==Gameplay==
[[File:MetalGearSolid2-Substance screenshot1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Solid Snake]] takes [[Cover system|cover]] and peeks around a corner in the Tanker chapter]]

''Metal Gear Solid 2'' carries the subtitle of "Tactical Espionage Action", and most of the game involves the protagonist sneaking around avoiding being seen by the enemies. Most fundamental is the wider range of skills offered to the player. The [[First-person shooter|first-person aiming]] mode allows players to target specific points in the game, greatly expanding tactical options; guards can be blinded by steam, distracted by a flying piece of fruit or hit in weak spots. Players can walk slowly, allowing them to sneak over noisy flooring without making a sound, or hang off walkways to slip past below guards' feet.

===Story===
{{Metal Gear chronology}}

====Prologue - Tanker chapter====
The game opens with a flashback, two years after the Shadow Moses incident in the original ''Metal Gear Solid''. On August 8, 2007, Solid Snake and Otacon, now members of the [[non-governmental organization]] Philanthropy, are investigating the development of a new Metal Gear by the [[United States Marine Corps]]. Snake arrives on the tanker transporting the weapon in the middle of an attack by Russian mercenaries, led by Colonel Gurlukovich, his daughter Olga and Snake's enemy Ocelot, who has transplanted the right arm of Liquid Snake following the loss of his own in ''Metal Gear Solid''.  After Snake knocks Olga unconscious, he sneaks down to the hold in order to record pictures of the new [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Metal Gear RAY|Metal Gear RAY]]. As the mercenaries take control below, Ocelot betrays his allies and shoots both Colonel Gurlukovich and the Marine commander. Just before Ocelot can commandeer Metal Gear RAY, Snake emerges and confronts him. Upon seeing Snake, Ocelot becomes possessed by Liquid Snake and escapes with RAY, leaving the ship to sink. In the aftermath, Snake is blamed for the disaster and is believed to have perished. The Big Shell clean-up facility is later constructed, ostensibly to help clean the [[Lower New York Bay]] after the major oil spill that occurred due to the tanker sinking.

====Plant chapter====
On April 29, 2009, Raiden (who operates briefly under the code name Snake) is tasked under a reformed [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#FOXHOUND|FOXHOUND]]. He has orders to infiltrate the Big Shell to rescue hostages, including the US president, from the terrorist group Sons of Liberty (whose leader claims to be Solid Snake), backed up by the rogue anti-terror training unit Dead Cell, who are also threatening to destroy the facility. All members of SEAL Team 10 are killed by Dead Cell members Vamp and Fortune, and the Big Shell is patrolled by the surviving Russian mercenaries from the Tanker chapter, led now by Olga, who is unaware of the extent of Ocelot's betrayal, and believes Snake was responsible for her father's murder. The remaining members of the SEAL assault team, Iroquois Pliskin and Peter Stillman join Raiden to disable explosives planted on the Shell by Stillman's former pupil, Fatman, now a terrorist. Stillman is killed by Fatman's booby trap in Shell 2, though he manages to warn Raiden in time, who successfully disables the respective bomb in Shell 1, preventing the sinking of the facility. Raiden then survives a direct confrontation with Fortune and Vamp, and kills Fatman on the heliport.

As Raiden searches for the President, he begins to doubt Pliskin's identity but agrees to the plan of transporting hostages off the Big Shell with a helicopter. However, they are attacked by the leader of the Sons of Liberty, who identifies himself as Solid Snake. Pliskin, however, shouts that the man is not Snake, and assists Raiden in fending off the leader when he attacks with a Harrier Jet piloted by Vamp. The battle ends with the Harrier being shot down, though it is seized by the Metal Gear RAY seen in the Tanker chapter, and the two terrorists escape. Pliskin reveals himself to be the real Solid Snake, who, along with Otacon, helps Raiden locate the President. When Raiden finally contacts President Johnson, he is informed that the Big Shell is a facade to hide a new Metal Gear. Known as Arsenal Gear, it houses a powerful [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] called "GW", which is capable of controlling the transmission of digital information. The President also claims that the democratic process is a sham, and the true rulers of the United States are a secret organization called the [[Patriots (Metal Gear)|Patriots]]. The President then reveals the leader of the Sons of Liberty is his predecessor George Sears, a perfect clone of [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]] known as [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Solidus Snake|Solidus Snake]], who fell out of the Patriots' favor following Shadow Moses and has now gone rogue with Dead Cell to escape the Patriots' control. Ocelot kills the President soon after this revelation. Raiden moves on to disabling Arsenal Gear, going to rescue an engineer, Emma Emmerich (Otacon's step-sister). After fighting Vamp, who seemingly drowns after being shot, Raiden rescues Emma, who agrees to help upload a virus into the "GW" mainframe. However, the upload is halted partway when Emma is attacked by Vamp. Raiden then defeats Vamp by shooting him again, although the injuries Emma suffers prove fatal. Otacon escapes with the surviving hostages, while Raiden is captured by Olga when Solid Snake seemingly betrays him.

Raiden awakens in a torture chamber where Solidus Snake reveals that he once adopted Raiden, a former child soldier, as his son during the [[First Liberian Civil War|Liberian civil war]] and that Raiden is now a Patriot agent. Solidus then leaves the chamber, and Olga steps in and frees Raiden, telling him that she is also a Patriot double-agent and that she was blackmailed to aid Raiden in order to protect her child. Olga also tells Raiden to find Solid Snake, who only allowed Raiden to be captured so he could gain access to Arsenal Gear. While Raiden makes his way through the bowels of the facility to rendezvous with Snake, his commanding officer, the Colonel, begins to act very erratically. Upon investigation, Otacon reveals that the "Colonel" is actually a construct of the GW supercomputer and that the partially uploaded virus is beginning to damage its systems. Raiden receives a call from Rose, whose voice begins to deepen and slow down as the conversation is cut off, but not before she reveals she is pregnant with his child. Raiden reunites with Snake and his gear, and the two then encounter Fortune, who fights Snake while Raiden searches for Solidus. He is then forced into a battle with twenty-five Metal Gear RAY units in Arsenal Gear. Olga protects him, before Solidus kills her, and captures Snake and Raiden. Ocelot reveals that he too is a Patriot agent and that the entire Big Shell mission was a carefully coordinated attempt to reenact the events of the Shadow Moses incident, for the purpose of creating a soldier (Raiden) on par with Solid Snake. Ocelot kills Fortune, before being possessed by Liquid again, who announces his plan to hunt down the Patriots using his host's knowledge and the first Metal Gear RAY. Snake escapes to pursue Liquid, as Arsenal Gear goes out of control.

The next morning on April 30, 2009, Arsenal crashes into downtown Manhattan, launching Raiden and Solidus onto the roof of [[Federal Hall National Memorial]]. Solidus attempts to kill Raiden, intending to use his nanomachines to lead him to the Patriots, eliminate them, and form a nation of "Sons of Liberty". At this point, Raiden is contacted by AI's of the Colonel and Rosemary, introducing themselves as representatives of the Patriots, who reveal that the true purpose of the simulation was to see how they could simulate and control human behavior in order to prevent society from dumbing down due to trivial information drowning valuable knowledge and inconvenient truths. They order Raiden to eliminate Solidus, threatening to kill Rose and Olga's child if he refuses to cooperate. After Solidus's death, Snake reveals he planted a tracking device on Liquid's Metal Gear. Snake and Otacon plan to follow him, rescue Olga's child, and hunt down the Patriots, whose details were hidden in the GW computer virus disc. Raiden is finally reunited with Rose for the anniversary of their first meeting.

In a brief epilogue, Otacon and Snake discuss the decoding of the virus disc, which contains the personal data on all twelve members of the Patriots' high council. However, it is revealed that not only is one of the Wisemen's Committee one of Philantropy's biggest contributors, but all of them have been dead for about one hundred years.

==Development==
The creator [[Hideo Kojima]]'s original design document for the game was completed in January 1999; it was made publicly available several years later and translated into English in 2006.&lt;ref name="joystiq_mgs2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Orland|first=Kyle|title=MGS2 design secrets translated|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/08/15/mgs2-design-secrets-translated/|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=21 December 2011|date=August 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It mentioned that the game was originally going to be called ''Metal Gear Solid III'' to symbolize [[Manhattan]]'s three tallest skyscrapers."&lt;ref name="joystiq_mgs2"/&gt; The document outlines new [[game mechanic]]s and features, such as bodies that need to be hidden, enemies being able to detect shadows, lights in an area that can be destroyed to affect enemy vision, realistic enemy [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] that relies on squad tactics rather than working individually, and multi-level environments that add an element of "vertical tension" to the stealth gameplay. It also outlines themes, such as passing on memories, [[environmentalism|environmental]] issues, and particularly social themes regarding the "digitization of the military," digital simulations, the "digitization of operational planning," the "digitization of everyday life," and the "effects of digitization on personality." The document stated that the "aim of the story" involves "a series of betrayals and sudden reversals, to the point where the player is unable to tell fact from fiction" (departing from the "very clear and understandable story" of its predecessor), that "every character lies to (betrays) someone once," blurring the line between "what is real, and what is fantasy," and "ironies aimed at the digital society and [[Video game culture|gaming culture]]."

The game's production budget was $10 million.&lt;ref name=final_hours&gt;{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-final-hours-of-metal-gear-solid-2-sons-of-liberty/1100-6376810/|author=Keighley, Geoff|website=Gamespot|accessdate=August 29, 2016|date=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kojima states that when he "heard about the hardware for the [[PlayStation 2]]," he "wanted to try something new. Up to that point, all [[cutscene]]s had focused more on details like facial expressions, but I wanted to pay more attention to the surroundings, to see how much I could change them in [[real-time game|real time]]."&lt;ref name="kojima25"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/07/23/hideo-kojima-reflects-on-25-years-of-metal-gear/ | title=Hideo Kojima Reflects on 25 Years of Metal Gear | publisher=[[PlayStation Blog]] | date=2012-07-23 | accessdate=September 14, 2012 | author=Grajales, Lorenzo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protagonist switch===
For ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', the established protagonist of [[Solid Snake]] was only made playable for the prologue portion of the game. A new protagonist named [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]] would substitute him as the player character for the main portion. The decision to introduce a new protagonist came from the idea of portraying Solid Snake from another character's perspective, but also to get around the dilemma of having to write gameplay tutorials directed at Snake, as Kojima felt that having to explain mission procedures and weapon handling to a veteran soldier like Snake would've felt unnatural after three games. The character of Raiden was created in order to appeal to female players after Kojima overheard female debuggers working on the first ''Metal Gear Solid'' remark that "games like that only have old men as protagonists."&lt;ref name=final_hours/&gt; Raiden's presence in the game was kept a secret prior to release, with preview trailers showing Snake in situations and battles that actually occurred to Raiden in the published game, such as a battle against a Harrier on [[George Washington Bridge]] and an encounter with the new Cyborg Ninja inside the tanker.

===Plot changes===
According to Kojima in the documentary ''Metal Gear Saga Vol. 1'', the original plot of the game revolved around nuclear weapon inspections in Iraq and Iran and had Solid Snake trying to stop the Metal Gear while it was located on an aircraft carrier, in a certain time limit, while trying to stop Liquid Snake and his group. However, about six months into the project the political situation in the Middle East became a concern and they decided that they could not make a game with such a plot. The tanker in the released game is based on this original plot.

''MGS2'' was also intended to reference the novel ''[[The New York Trilogy|City of Glass]]'', notably in the naming of its characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/metal-gear-solid-2-sons-of-liberty |title=Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raiden's support team originally featured a different field commander named Colonel Daniel Quinn; Maxine "Max" Work, an Asian woman who saves game data and quotes [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and William "Doc" Wilson, the creator of GW. All take their names from key characters in the book, and all three would have turned out to be [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. None of these characters survived to the final edition, their roles being absorbed by other characters, namely the "Colonel Campbell" simulation, Rose, and Emma Emmerich. Peter Stillman, however, takes his name from another ''City of Glass'' character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Metal Gear Solid 2: Grand Game Plan Page 26 | url=http://www.kojimaproductions.net/docs/ | format=PDF | work=The Kojima Productions Network | accessdate=14 September 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723172855/http://www.kojimaproductions.net/docs/ | archivedate=23 July 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A character named Chinaman, originally planned to be included as a villain, was later on omitted and his abilities incorporated in Vamp, namely the ability to walk on water and walls. Chinaman would have movements modeled after [[Jet Li]] and have a body tattoo of a dragon that would come alive as soon as he dove into the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOcxiyuT2YE&amp;feature=related |title=6:20, Retrieved: Feb 17, 2010 |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2009-06-28 |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant changes to the game's ending were made late in development following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]] in New York, where the finale occurs. A sequence depicting Arsenal Gear's displacement of the [[Statue of Liberty]] and crashing through half of Manhattan was removed, as was a short coda to appear after the credits, a breaking newscast showing the Statue of Liberty's new resting place, [[Ellis Island]]. At the point where Solidus dies, Raiden was supposed to have cut the rope on Federal Hall's flagpole, causing an American flag to fall over Solidus' body, and American flags that were supposed to be on all the flagpoles in New York were removed from the title.&lt;ref name="doco"&gt;{{cite video | people=Hideo Kojima |date=2002| title=The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2 | medium=DVD | location=New Zealand | publisher=Konami}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese spelling of the name "Raiden" was changed from [[katakana]] (ライデン) to [[kanji]] (雷電) due to the former form of the name resembling "[[Osama bin Laden|Bin Laden]]" in Japanese.{{efn|See the [[:ja:ウサーマ・ビン・ラーディン#.E8.A1.A8.E8.A8.98|Japanese language Wikipedia]] for information about spelling variations of Osama bin Laden.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leone|first=Matt|title=Patchwork Fixes|url=http://www.1up.com/features/how-japans-earthquake-changed-developers?pager.offset=1|work=How Japan's Earthquake Changed its Developers|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=30 November 2011|page=2|date=November 21, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69iuhkqcE?url=http://www.1up.com/features/how-japans-earthquake-changed-developers?pager.offset=1|archivedate=6 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|description=30-second sample from the main [[theme (music)|theme]] of ''Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty'', composed by [[Tappi Iwase|TAPPY]] and [[Harry Gregson-Williams]].
|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Kojima's choice of composer for ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was highly publicized in the run-up to the game's release, with him deciding upon [[Harry Gregson-Williams]], a film composer from [[Hans Zimmer]]'s studio, after watching ''[[The Replacement Killers]]'' with sound director Kazuki Muraoka. A [[Mixtape|mix CD]] containing 18 tracks of Gregson-Williams' work was sent to his office. Flattered by the research put into creating the CD (as some of the tracks were unreleased, and that what tracks he'd worked on for some films were undocumented), he joined the project soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gregson-Williams' interview in The Making of Documentary in the Bonus Making Of DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to bypass the language barrier and allow the score to be developed before the cutscenes were finalized, Gregson-Williams was sent short phrases or descriptions of the intended action. The resultant themes then shaped the action sequences in return. Gregson-Williams also arranged and re-orchestrated the original "''Metal Gear Solid'' Main Theme" for use in the game's opening title sequence.

[[Norihiko Hibino]], who had worked on previous Konami games such as ''[[Metal Gear Solid (Game Boy)|Metal Gear: Ghost Babel]]'', was responsible for the in-game music. He also worked on the majority of the game's [[cutscene]]s, re-orchestrating Gregson-Williams' "Main Theme" remix for use in several sequences.

As with ''Metal Gear Solid'', the cutscene music includes orchestral and choir pieces, while the in-game soundtrack is scored with [[ambient music]]. However, the score as a whole incorporates more electronic elements (particularly [[breakbeat]]) than its predecessor, in order to reflect the plot's thematic thrust of a machine-dominated society. [[Rika Muranaka]] again provided a vocal ending theme, a jazz track entitled "Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday", sung by [[Carla White]]. The game's music was released via four CDs: ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Original Soundtrack]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Soundtrack 2: The Other Side]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Limited Soundtrack Ultimate Sorter Edition|Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Limited Sorter (Black Edition)]]'' and ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Limited Soundtrack Ultimate Sorter Edition|Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Ultimate Sorter (White Edition)]]''.

The game's main theme was chosen by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] for their ''Greatest Video Game Music'' compilation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/10/london-philharmonic-orchestra-to-release-video-gam.html|title=London Philharmonic Orchestra To Release Video Game-Themed Album|accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the theme is a key regular in the ''[[Video Games Live]]'' concert when the ''Metal Gear Solid'' segment is introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videogameslive.com/index.php?s=losangeles10 |title=Video Games live &amp;#124; http |publisher=Video games live|date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A segment of the song's main chorus is included in the closing sequence of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIHci5x2R58|title=4:40 Mark and 6:53 Mark; the MGS2 theme creeps in upon Big Boss' praise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Solid-Original-Soundtrack/dp/tracks/B000666VRY/ref=dp_tracks_all_1#disc_1|title=Track 37 "Debreifing"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Releases==
In contrast to the original ''Metal Gear Solid'', ''Sons of Liberty'' was released in North America first, on November 13, 2001. Because of the later release in the region, the protagonist switch was not kept a secret in the Japanese version in the weeks prior to its release. A preview event was held in [[Zepp|Zepp Tokyo]] on the day of the game's North American release in which the character of Raiden was unveiled to the Japanese public.&lt;ref name=itmedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itmedia.co.jp/games/gsnews/0111/13/news10.html|title=SBG:MGS2完成披露パーティ開催！新キャラも発表|trans-title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Completion Announcement Event! New Character Unveilment|website=IT Media|date=November 13, 2001|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Japanese packaging artwork depicts Raiden standing prominently next to Solid Snake, as opposed to only having Snake like on the cover artwork used for the American (and later European) version. A questionnaire was also added in the Japanese version, in which players are asked about their experience with the original ''Metal Gear Solid'' and action games in general; the answers to the questionnaire determines the difficulty level of the game and whether the player starts the game on the Tanker chapter or skips directly to the Plant chapter (an option that is only available after clearing the game once in the American version). The Japanese version has a few other additional features over the American version, including two extra game modes unlocked after completing the main game: Boss Survival, in which the player replays through the boss battles from the main game as either, Snake or Raiden; and Casting Theater, in which the player can view certain cutscenes from the main game and replace the character models.

The Japanese version was released on November 29, two weeks after the American version. As with the original ''Metal Gear Solid'', ''Sons of Liberty'' was sold in a limited "Premium Package" edition in addition to the standard release, which was packaged in a black box containing the game itself with a reversible cover art on the DVD case (with Snake on one side and Raiden on the other), a video DVD known as the ''Premium Disc'', which features a collection of ''Metal Gear Solid''-related commercials and trailers, a metallic Solid Snake figurine, and an 80-page booklet titled ''Metal Gear Chronicle'' featuring artwork and commentary about the series.

The European version, which was initially scheduled for February 22, 2002, was released on March 8, nearly four months after the other regions. The added features from the Japanese release were carried over to the European version, along with a new difficulty setting (European Extreme). The European version came packaged with a video DVD titled ''The Making of Metal Gear Solid 2''. As well as collating all of the game's promotional trailers and a [[GameSpot]] feature on the game's final days of development, it features a titular documentary produced by French television production house FunTV, which was filmed at KCE Japan West's Japanese studio. The DVD was included as an apology to European consumers for the several month delay that had occurred since the original November release in North America and Japan, which saw numerous European gaming magazines detail the various twists in the game.

===''The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2''===
Released on September 12, 2002, in Japan and September 24 in North America, ''The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2'' is an interactive database for the PlayStation 2 that documents the development of ''Metal Gear Solid 2''. It contains a gallery of all the 3D models of characters, scenery, and objects that were used in the game (as well as unused assets), along with corresponding concept art when available. All the real-time cutscenes (or polygon demos) are also available to view (without audio), with the option to pause them at any point, change the camera angle and move them frame by frame. Other content includes storyboards, behind-the-scenes footage, preview trailers, music tracks (with the option to play alternate patterns when applicable), the finalized screenplay, Hideo Kojima's original draft (available in Japanese only), a development timeline, and a gallery of ''Metal Gear Solid'' related products and merchandise. The disc also includes a sampler selection of VR training missions that were later featured in ''Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance''. In Europe, the disc was bundled as a bonus with the PlayStation 2 version of ''Substance'' instead of having a stand-alone release. It was also included in the Japanese 20th Anniversary re-release of ''Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty'' in July 2007.

===''Substance''===

''Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance'', the expanded edition of the game, was released on the original Xbox and Microsoft Windows in addition to the PlayStation 2.{{efn|Except in Japan, where ''Substance'' was exclusive to the PlayStation 2 as well. This version features Japanese text and English voice acting, similar to the earlier ''[[Metal Gear Solid#Integral|Metal Gear Solid: Integral]]'' (the expanded edition of the original ''Metal Gear Solid'').}} The Xbox version was initially released in North America as a timed exclusive for the console on November 5, 2002. This was followed by the PlayStation 2 version, released in Japan on December 19 of the same year. ''Substance'' was eventually released on PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows in North America and on all three platforms in Europe in March 2003. The console versions were developed internally by KCE Japan, whereas the Windows port was outsourced to [[Success (company)|Success]].

''Substance'' contains several supplemental game modes in addition to the main story mode from the original ''Sons of Liberty'' releases. The main game contains all the changes and additions that were made in the Japanese and European versions of the original release (e.g. Boss Survival, Casting Theater, European Extreme), along with further additional changes. Players can now start the main story mode at the Tanker or Plant chapters without the need to answer a questionnaire first and a new set of collectible dog tags have been added (exclusively on the PlayStation 2 version) based on names submitted from a second contest in addition to the original (2001) set. The visual effect for the [[Thermography|thermal goggles]] was also changed in ''Substance'' and the ''[[FHM]]''-licensed posters that adorned several locations in the original ''Sons of Liberty'' version have been replaced with public domain images (these were also replaced in ''The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2''). The Xbox and Windows versions feature slight dialogue changes during certain control explanations in which the term "analog stick" was substituted with "thumbstick" (Microsoft's preferred term). The controls were also slightly altered for the Xbox version, due to its fewer shoulder buttons (clicking on the left thumbstick switches between normal and first-person view, while the Y button serves as a lock-on for the player's aim). The Xbox version has support for [[5.1 surround sound]].

The primary addition of ''Substance'' is the inclusion of an extra missions mode with 350 VR missions set in a computer-constructed environment and 150 "Alternative" missions set in areas from the main story. The player can choose to play these missions as Solid Snake or Raiden, with alternate versions of both characters (in different outfits) becoming available as the player progresses. These missions are divided into eight categories (although not all of them are available to every character): Sneaking, Weapon, First Person View (which simulates a [[first-person shooter]]), Variety, Hold Up, Bomb Disposal, Elimination, and Photograph.

The other new addition is "Snake Tales", which is a set of five story-based missions featuring Solid Snake as the player character. These missions are primarily set in the Big Shell and involve characters from the main story in new roles such as Fatman, Emma, Vamp and Solidus Snake, while one mission set in the Tanker has [[Meryl Silverburgh]] (from the original ''Metal Gear Solid'') as the main antagonist. These missions, which are unrelated to the main story, have no voice acted cutscenes - instead, the story is told through text in interludes.

Exclusive to the PlayStation 2 version is a skateboarding minigame in which the player control Snake or Raiden in a pair of Big Shell-themed levels. The player has to complete a set of objectives before time runs out, which range from collecting dog tags scattered throughout the level to blowing up parts of Big Shell. The minigame uses the same engine from ''[[Evolution Skateboarding]]'', which was developed by [[Konami#Former subsidiaries|Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Greg Kasavin | title=Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance (PlayStation 2) | url=http://reviews.cnet.com/playstation-2-games/metal-gear-solid-2/4505-9581_7-30984449.html | accessdate = 2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the additional content from ''Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance'' has also been ported in this version, such as the Missions and Snake Tales modes, although the Skateboarding minigame that was present in the PlayStation 2 version of ''Substance'' is absent. The PS3 and Vita versions have a "transfarring" option that allows players to transfer save data between both versions through a [[wi-fi]] connection or a [[cloud computing|cloud network]]. The Vita version has [[touchscreen]] and [[touchpad]] support for certain gameplay functions such as switching between items and weapons or zooming into cutscenes.

[[IDW Publishing]] published a 12-issue comic book adaptation from 2006 to 2007, titled ''Metal Gear Solid: Sons of Liberty'', illustrated by [[Ashley Wood]] (who also worked on the comic book adaptation of the previous game) and written by Alex Garner. This version deviates from the game, where many scenes involving Raiden are substituted with Snake.

A digital version of the comic, titled ''Metal Gear Solid 2: Bande Dessinée'', was released on June 12, 2008, in Japan. Originally announced as a [[PlayStation Portable]] game, similar to the ''[[Metal Gear Solid#Related media|Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel]]'', the digital comic was released as a [[DVD]] film instead.

===Retrospective analysis===
''Metal Gear Solid 2'' is often considered the first example of a [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] video game&lt;ref name=Konkle/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sallee/&gt;&lt;ref name=Howell/&gt; and has often been cited as a primary example of [[Video games as an art form|artistic expression in video games]].&lt;ref name=Konkle/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weise/&gt;&lt;ref name=Howell/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; In his paper ''How Videogames Express Ideas'', Matthew Weise of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] described '' Sons of Liberty'' as "perhaps the most vivid example of a game that uses tension between different levels of player [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] to fuel a multi-faceted ideological argument," noting Solidus Snake's suggestion of the United States being a "[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime of [[Mind control|thought control]]" and pointing to the "very [[Metafiction|meta concept]]" of "how the designer’s imposed plan or path for the player maps to the [[Tyrant|tyrannical]] nature of the [[government]]", where, "like the player, [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Jack]] has no agency other than what his puppet masters give him."&lt;ref name=Weise/&gt; In the book ''Joystick Soldiers: The Politics of Play in Military Video Games'', Tanner Higgin examined the game's "resistant and subversive counter-history of military engagement," describing its "convoluted narrative and unconventional gameplay logics" as a "critique" of "the very networks of [[Biopolitics|biopolitical]] and informational control that comprise the postmodern military, and [[posthuman]]ity generally," and noting that it "purposefully manufactures frustration and negative affect" to "highlight the typically unexamined codes, conventions, and hidden pleasures of the military game genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Higgin|first=Tanner|title=Joystick Soldiers: The Politics of Play in Military Video Games|year=2010|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|isbn=0-415-99659-7|pages=15–6 &amp; 252–71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GGq86_6HWgC&amp;pg=PA15|editor=Nina B.

Jeremy Parish of [[1UP.com]] notes that "''Metal Gear Solid 2'' is a game built on [[misinformation]]" and that it "was simply too [[avant-garde]]&amp;mdash;too clever&amp;mdash;for its own good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parish|first=Jeremy|title=Metal Gear Solid 2: Gaming's Greatest Con Job|url=http://www.1up.com/features/metal-gear-solid-2-gamings-greatest-con-job|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=December 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69ivC0Gad?url=http://www.1up.com/features/metal-gear-solid-2-gamings-greatest-con-job|archivedate=6 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Poole]] commented in a 2012 ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' column, "the story of ''MGS2'', with its mythic wit and sweep, is still in a different league from the vast majority of videogame yarns. ... [H]owever, the fact that ''MGS2'' still seems so avant-garde today might well prompt a worry: does it represent the pinnacle of a now-vanished era, the age of the experimental mainstream?

Fifteen years after its original release, Alex Wiltshire of ''[[Rolling Stone|Glixel]]'' found the game to be "strangely prescient of not only its own time but also today", noting how it dodged "[[truth]] at every turn" and comparing it to [[post-truth politics]], [[Facebook]]'s curated [[News Feed]], and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref name="glixel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wiltshire|first1=Alex|title=Flashback: How 'Metal Gear Solid 2' Foretold Our Post-Truth Future|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119172715/www.glixel.com/news/how-metal-gear-solid-2-foretold-our-post-truth-future-w450225|website=Glixel|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Montegriffo of [[Moviepilot]] further draws comparisons to contemporary concepts such as [[fake news]], [[Echo chamber (media)|echo chambers]] and [[alternative facts]].&lt;ref&gt;https://nowloading.co/posts/4199069/amp&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cameron Kunzelman of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' is still politically relevant in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/the-scary-political-relevance-of-metal-gear-solid-2&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, [[GamesRadar]] drew comparisons to recent political events including the [[Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal]] and the investigations involving [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How Metal Gear Solid manipulated its players, warning us of an age of Fake News, Cambridge Analytica and data surveillance |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/how-metal-gear-solid-manipulated-its-players-warning-us-of-an-age-of-fake-news-cambridge-analytica-and-data-surveillance/ |work=[[GamesRadar]] |date=March 30, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' included the game in its list of "The 15 Most Influential Games of the Decade" at #13, concluding that every "videogame story that subverts a player’s expectations owes a debt to the ground broken by ''Metal Gear Solid 2''."&lt;ref name="wired_influential"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohler|first=Chris|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/12/the-15-most-influential-games-of-the-decade/all/1|title=The 15 Most Influential Games of the Decade|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=10 September 2011|date=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic influence of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' can be seen in later video games such as [[Goichi Suda]]'s similarly postmodern game ''[[Killer7]]'',&lt;ref name=Sallee/&gt; the similarly [[metanarrative]] game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|title=The Meta-Narrative That Pulls Back The Curtain For All Games|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/11/the-meta-narrative-that-pulls-back-the-curtain-for-all-games/|work=Kotaku Australia|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=1 June 2012|location=Australia|date=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[survival horror]] title ''[[Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem]]'', and particularly the [[first-person shooter]] ''[[BioShock]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GameSpy's Top MGS Moments: Metal Gear Solid 2 (Day Two)|page=3|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=May 16, 2008|url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/874/874851p3.html|accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured a similar plot twist to ''Metal Gear Solid 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kessler|first=Matthew|title=The End of Metal Gear Solid 4 makes me Crazy|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MatthewKessler/20090415/1168/The_End_of_Metal_Gear_Solid_4_makes_me_Crazy.php|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[game mechanics]] developed in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', such as the [[cover system]] and [[laser sight]] mechanic, have since become staples of stealth games as well as [[Shooter game|shooters]], including ''[[Kill Switch (video game)|Kill Switch]]'' (2003), ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005) and ''[[Gears of War]]'' (2006).&lt;ref name="Did Gears of War Innovate the Cover System"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gameinformer_retro"/&gt; According to Kojima, ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' paid more "attention to the surroundings" in real-time and later "games like ''[[Call of Duty]]'' have followed this trend of making your surroundings more realistic."&lt;ref name="kojima25"/&gt;

The early anticipation that surrounded ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' since its [[E3 2000]] demo has also been credited as a key factor in the PlayStation 2's [[List of million-selling game consoles|best-selling]] success and dominance during the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth console generation]], as well as the demise of [[Sega]]'s [[Dreamcast]].&lt;ref name="1up_dc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parish|first=Jeremy|title=Enter PS2|url=http://www.1up.com/features/9999-dreamcast-memorial?pager.offset=2|work=9.9.99, A Dreamcast Memorial: A decade later, what is the Dreamcast's legacy?|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=16 September 2011|page=3|date=September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69ivGc0x2?url=http://www.1up.com/features/9999-dreamcast-memorial?pager.offset=2|archivedate=6 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Szczepaniak, "''MGS2'' was the game which single-handedly sold Sony's new PlayStation 2 to the masses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/metalgear/agnesskaku.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102014318/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/metalgear/agnesskaku.htm|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|archivedate=January 2, 2014 |title=Metal Gear}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reveal of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' also led to the development of ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (video game)|Splinter Cell]]'', which [[Ubisoft]] originally intended to be "a ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' killer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dyer |first=Mitch |title=House of Dreams: The Ubisoft Montreal Story |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/03/house-of-dreams-the-ubisoft-montreal-story |website=[[IGN]] |date=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hocking"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Clint Hocking |url=https://gamecritics.com/thom-moyles/3651/ |website=GameCritics |accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''MGS2'', along with its [[Metal Gear Solid|predecessor]], has been featured in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]'s exhibition The Art of Video Games in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/|title=Exhibitions: The Art of Video Games / American Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''WhatCulture'' noted a number of striking similarities between ''Sons of Liberty'' and the 2014 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', including a similar opening tanker mission, shady cyborg-like antagonist, and organization covertly attempting to shape the world's future, as well as a close-quarters combat fight scene similar to later ''Metal Gear Solid'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=12 Movies You Didn't Realise Were Just Ripping Off Video Games |url=http://whatculture.com/gaming/12-movies-you-didnt-realise-were-just-ripping-off-video-games?page=6 |website=WhatCulture |date=March 2, 2015 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' also noted that the film's opening tanker mission was "rendered as a ''Metal Gear Solid'' stealth mission".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The real, subversive politics of 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' |url=https://ew.com/article/2014/04/06/captain-america-the-winter-soldier-hydra-shield-paranoia/ |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mingrelian''' or '''Megrelian''' ({{lang|xmf|მარგალური ნინა}} ''margaluri nina'') is a [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian language]] spoken in Western [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (regions of [[Samegrelo]] and [[Abkhazia]]), primarily by [[Mingrelians]]. The language was also called '''Iverian''' (Georgian ''iveriuli ena'') in the early 20th century. Since Mingrelian has historically been only a regional language within boundaries of both historical Georgian states and modern Georgia, the number of younger people speaking it has decreased substantially, with [[UNESCO]] designating it as a "definitely [[endangered language]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1057.html|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|author=|date=|website=www.unesco.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and status==
No reliable figures exist for the number of Mingrelian native speakers, but it is estimated to be between 300,000 and 500,000. Most speakers live in the [[Samegrelo]] (Mingrelia) region of Georgia, which comprises the [[Odishi Hills]] and the Kolkheti Lowlands, from the [[Black Sea]] coast to the [[Svan Mountains]] and the [[Tskhenistskali River]]. Smaller enclaves existed in [[Abkhazia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5253.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=9 April 2016|location=First paragraph, third sentence|quote=The United States supports Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, and does not recognize the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions of Georgia, currently occupied by Russia, as independent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ongoing civil unrest there has displaced many Mingrelian speakers to other regions of Georgia. Their geographical distribution is relatively compact, which has helped to promote the transmission of the language between generations.

Mingrelian is generally written with the [[Georgian alphabet]], but has no written standard or official status. Almost all speakers are bilingual; they use Mingrelian mainly for familiar and informal conversation, and [[Georgian language|Georgian]] (or, for expatriate speakers, the local official language) for other purposes.

In the summer of 1999, books of the Georgian poet Murman Lebanidze were burned in the Mingrelian capital, [[Zugdidi]], after he made disparaging remarks about the Mingrelian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMZm0w0k1c4C&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA1899#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Sociolinguistics: an international handbook of the science of language and society | page=1899 | isbn=978-3-11-018418-1 | year=2006 | publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH | editor1-first=Ulrich | editor1-last=Ammon | editor2-first=Norbert | editor2-last=Dittmar | editor3-first=Klaus J. | editor3-last=Mattheier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mingrelian is one of the [[Kartvelian languages]]. It is closely related to [[Laz language|Laz]], from which it has differentiated mostly in the last 500 years, after the northern (Mingrelian) and southern (Laz) communities were separated by Turkic invasions. It is somewhat less closely related to Georgian (the two branches having separated in the first millennium BC or earlier) and even more distantly related to [[Svan language|Svan]] (which is believed to have branched off in the 2nd millennium BC or earlier).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~wschulze/lgxcauc.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610082958/http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~wschulze/lgxcauc.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-10 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Mingrelian is not [[mutually intelligible]] with any of those other languages, although it is said that its speakers can recognize many Laz words.

Some linguists refer to Mingrelian and Laz as grouped within the [[Zan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icgl.org/articles/ReviewofColchian.doc K2olxuri Ena (Colchian Language)]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301071254/http://www.icgl.org/articles/ReviewofColchian.doc |date=March 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zan had already split into Mingrelian and Laz variants by early modern times, however, and it is not customary to speak of a unified Zan language today.

The oldest surviving texts in Mingrelian date from the 19th century, and are mainly ethnographical literature. The earliest linguistic studies of Mingrelian include a phonetic analysis by [[Aleksandre Tsagareli]] (1880), and grammars by [[Ioseb Kipshidze]] (1914) and [[Shalva Beridze]] (1920). From 1930 to 1938 several newspapers were published in Mingrelian, such as ''[[Kazakhishi Gazeti]]'', ''[[Komuna (Megrelian newspaper)|Komuna]]'', ''[[Samargalosh Chai]]'', ''[[Narazenish Chai]]'', and ''[[Samargalosh Tutumi]]''. More recently, there has been some revival of the language, with the publication of dictionaries—Mingrelian–Georgian by [[Otar Kajaia]], and Mingrelian-German by Otar Kajaia and [[Heinz Fähnrich]]—and poetry books by [[Lasha Gakharia]], [[Edem Izoria]], [[Lasha Gvasalia]], [[Guri Otobaia]], [[Giorgi Sichinava]], [[Jumber Kukava]], and [[Vakhtang Kharchilava]], as well as books and magazines published by Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jw.org/xmf/%E1%83%9E%E1%83%A3%E1%83%91%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%E1%83%99%E1%83%90%E1%83%AA%E1%83%98%E1%83%94%E1%83%A4%E1%83%98/|title=იეჰოვაშ მოწმეეფიშ გიშაშკუმალირი ბიბლიური წიგნეფი დო ჟურნალეფი|author=|date=|website=jw.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Mingrelian has five primary vowels ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u''. The Zugdidi-Samurzaqano dialect has a sixth, ''ə'', which is the result of reduction of ''i'' and ''u''.

===Phonetic processes===

====Vowel reduction====
Certain pairs of vowels reduce to single vowels:{{clarify|reason=are "ee aa uu" supposed to be historical forms, underlying forms or what?|date=April 2013}}
*''ae'' and ''ai'' → ''ee'' → ''e''
*''ao'', ''oa'' and ''oo'' → ''aa'' → ''a''
*''ou → uu → u''

In Zugdidi-Samurzaqano dialect the vowels ''i'' and ''u'' also often reduce to ''ə''.

====Pre-consonant change of velar ''g''====
Before consonants, ''g'' → ''r''.

====Positional change of uvular ''q''' sound====
In word-initial prevocalic and intervocalic positions, ''q' → ʔ''. Before the consonant ''v'', ''q' → ʔ/ḳ''.

====Regressive assimilation of consonants====
The common types are:
*voicing/devoicing of voiceless/voiced consonants before voiced/voiceless ones (respectively).
*glottalization of consonants before the glottalized ones and the glottal stop.

====Progressive dissimilation====
If the stem contains ''r'' then the suffixes ''-ar'' and ''-ur'' transform to ''-al'' and ''-ul'', e.g. ''xorga ([[Khorga]], the village)→ xorg-ul-i'' ("Khorgan").
The rule is not valid if in the stem with ''r'' an ''l'' appears later, e.g. ''marṭvili ("[[Martvili]]", the town) → marṭvil-ur-i (adj. "Martvilian")''

In a stem with voiceless affricates or voiceless sibilants, a later ''ǯ'' is [[Deaffrication|deaffricated]] to ''d'', e.g. ''orcxonǯi → orcxondi'' "comb", ''č'anǯi → č'andi'' "fly (insect)", ''isinǯi → isindi'' "arrow", etc.

====The transformation of ''l''====
*in all dialects of Mingrelian, before consonants ''l'' → ''r''.
*in the Martvili subdialect in word-initial prevocalic position, ''l  → y  → ∅'' and in intervocalic position ''l → ∅'' {{elucidate|reason=how do these differ?|date=February 2011}}

====Intervocalic deletion of ''v''====
Between the vowels the organic{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} ''v'' disappears, e.g. ''xvavi (Geo. "abundance, plenty") → *xvai → xvee'' (id.), ''mṭevani (Geo. "raceme") → ṭiani'' (id.), etc.

====Phonetic augmentation ''n''====
Before the stops and affricates, an inorganic{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} augmentation ''n'' may appear (before labials ''n → m'').

{{redirect|Narrator}}
'''Narration''' is the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a [[narrative|story]] to an [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narration in Poetry and Drama|author-last1=Hühn|author-first1=Peter|author-last2=Sommer|author-first2=Roy|work=The Living Handbook of Narratology|year=2012|publisher=Interdisciplinary Center for Narratology, University of Hamburg|url=http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narration-poetry-and-drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narration encompasses a set of techniques through which the [[author|creator of the story]] presents their story, including:
* '''Narrative point of view'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ezproxy.dacc.edu:4443/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.dacc.edu:4048/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ers&amp;AN=98402287&amp;site=eds-live|title=Narration|last=Woltag|first=Laura|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative voice'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;: the format through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative time''': the [[grammatical tense|grammatical placement]] of the story's time-frame in the past, the present, or the future.

A ''narrator'' is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator (author) of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. In the case of most written narratives (novels, short stories, poems, etc.), the narrator typically functions to convey the story in its entirety. The narrator may be a voice devised by the author as an anonymous, non-personal, or stand-alone entity; as the author as a character; or as some other fictional or non-fictional character appearing and participating within their own story. The narrator is considered ''participant'' if he/she is a character within the story, and  ''non-participant'' if he/she is an implied character or an omniscient or semi-omniscient being or voice that merely relates the story to the audience without being involved in the actual events. Some stories have [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]] to illustrate the storylines of various characters at the same, similar, or different times, thus allowing a more complex, non-singular point of view.

Narration encompasses not only ''who'' tells the story, but also ''how'' the story is told (for example, by using [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] or [[unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]]). In traditional literary narratives (such as [[novels]], [[short stories]], and [[memoir]]s), narration is a required [[literary element|story element]]; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.

== Narrative point of view ==
Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be thought of as a camera mounted on the narrator's shoulder that can also look back inside the narrator's mind.

=== First-person ===
{{Main article|First-person narrative}}
With the ''first-person'' point of view, a story is revealed through a narrator who is also explicitly a [[Character (arts)|character]] within his or her own story. In a first person narrative, the narrator can create a close relationship between the reader and the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyile|first=Andrea Schwenke|date=1999|title=Expanding the View of First-Person Narration|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|pages=185–202|doi=10.1023/a:1022433202145|issn=0045-6713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the narrator reveals the plot by referring to this viewpoint character with forms of "I" (that is, the narrator is a person who openly acknowledges his or her own existence) or, when part of a larger group, "we". Frequently, the narrator is the [[protagonist]], whose inner thoughts are expressed to the audience, even if not to any of the other characters. A conscious narrator, as a human participant of past events, is an incomplete witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. Forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the [[focal character]].

=== Second-person ===

The ''second-person'' point of view is a point of view where the audience is made a character. This is done with the use of the pronouns "you", "your", and "yours." The narrator is trying to address the audience, not necessarily directly, but rather to administer more of a connection. Stories and novels in second person are comparatively rare.  Examples include the short fiction of [[Lorrie Moore]] and [[Junot Díaz]]. An example in contemporary literature is [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]],'' in which the second-person narrator is observing his life from a distance as a way to cope with a trauma he keeps hidden from readers for most of the book.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy."—Opening lines of [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1984)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== {{anchor|third}}Third-person&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ===
In the ''third-person'' narrative mode, characters are referred to by the narrator as "he", "she", or "they", but never as "I" or "we" (first-person), or "you" (second-person). This makes it clear that the narrator is an unspecified [[entity]] or uninvolved person who conveys the story and is not a character of any kind within the story, or at least is not referred to as such.&lt;ref name="Ricoeur1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Ricoeur|title=Time and Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vjBw9NuSkuEC&amp;pg=PA89|date=15 September 1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-71334-2|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, third-person narration is the most commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require that the narrator's existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about the teller (narrator) of the story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied "commentary" or "voice", rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the  "he/she" perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid.  ''The Narrator'', Iran: Baqney 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third-person modes are usually categorized along two axes. The first is the subjectivity/objectivity axis, with ''third person subjective'' narration describing one or more character's personal feelings and thoughts, and ''third person objective'' narration not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story. The second axis is the omniscient/limited axis, a distinction that refers to the knowledge held by the narrator. A ''third person omniscient'' narrator has, or seems to have, access to knowledge of all characters, places, and events of the story, including any given characters' thoughts; however, a ''third person limited '' narrator, in contrast, knows information about, and within the minds of, only a limited number of characters (often just one character). A limited narrator cannot describe anything outside of a focal character's particular knowledge and experiences.

=== Alternating person ===
While the tendency for novels (or other narrative works) is to adopt a single point of view throughout the entire novel, some authors have experimented with other points of view that, for example, alternate between different narrators who are all first-person, or alternate between a first- and a third-person narrative perspective. The ten books of the ''[[Pendragon: Journal of an Adventure through Time and Space|Pendragon]]'' adventure series, by [[D. J. MacHale]], switch back and forth between a first-person perspective (handwritten journal entries) of the main character along his journey and the disembodied third-person perspective of his friends back home.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Claire E (2004). "[http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/oct04/a-conversation-with-d-j-machale-10041 A Conversation With D.J. MacHale]." ''The Internet Writing Journal''. Writer Write, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Alias Grace]]'' provides one character's viewpoint from first-person as well as another character's from third-person limited. Often, a narrator using the first person will try to be more objective by also employing the third person for important action scenes, especially those in which they are not directly involved or in scenes where they are not present to have viewed the events in firsthand. This mode is found in [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s ''[[The Poisonwood Bible]]''.

[[Audrey Niffenegger]]'s ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife]]'' is a love story, told in alternating first person. This novel alternates between an art student named Clare, and a librarian named Henry. Henry’s disorder called Chronic-Displacement causes him to be put in the wrong time. He is then put in emotional parts from his past and future, going back and forth in time. [[John Green (author)|John Green]] &amp; [[David Levithan]]'s novel ''[[Will Grayson, Will Grayson]]'' rotates between two boys both named Will Grayson. It alternates between both boys telling their part of the story, how they meet and how their lives then come together. [[Nick Hornby]]'s ''[[A Long Way Down]]'' has four narrators who also, are its main characters. These four characters meet at the top of a tall building known as “the suicide spot” and begin to talk instead of jumping. They then form a group, and continue to meet up.

== Narrative voice ==
The narrative voice is essential for story telling, because it's setting up the story for the reader, for example, by "viewing" a character's thought processes, reading a letter written for someone, retelling a character's experiences, etc.

=== Stream-of-consciousness voice ===
{{Main article|Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)}}
A ''stream of consciousness'' gives the (typically first-person) narrator's perspective by attempting to replicate the thought processes—as opposed to simply the actions and spoken words—of the narrative character. Often, interior monologues and inner desires or motivations, as well as pieces of incomplete thoughts, are expressed to the audience but not necessarily to other characters. Examples include the multiple narrators' feelings in William Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' and ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'', and the character Offred's often fragmented thoughts in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]''. Irish writer [[James Joyce]] exemplifies this style in his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

=== Character voice ===
One of the most common narrative voices, used especially with first- and third-person viewpoints, is the ''character voice'', in which a conscious "person" (in most cases, a living human being) is presented as the narrator; this character is called a ''viewpoint character''. In this situation, the narrator is no longer an unspecified entity; rather, the narrator is a more relatable, realistic character who may or may not be involved in the actions of the story and who may or may not take a biased approach in the [[storytelling]]. If the character is directly involved in the plot, this narrator is also called the viewpoint character. The viewpoint character is not necessarily the focal character: examples of supporting viewpoint characters include [[Doctor Watson]], Scout in ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and Nick Carraway of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''.

==== Unreliable voice ====
{{Main article|Unreliable narrator}}
The unreliable narrative voice involves the use of an untrustworthy narrator. This mode may be employed to give the audience a deliberate sense of disbelief in the story or a level of suspicion or mystery as to what information is meant to be true and what is meant to be false. The narrator of Poe's "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]," for example, is significantly biased, unknowledgeable, ignorant, childish, or is perhaps purposefully trying to deceive the audience.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators; however, a third-person narrator may be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jlse.2017.46.issue-1/jls-2017-0005/jls-2017-0005.xml Unreliable Third Person Narration? The Case of Katherine Mansfield], ''Journal of Literary Semantics,'' Vol. 46, Issue 1, April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistolary voice ===
{{Main article|Epistolary novel}}

The ''epistolary narrative voice'' uses a (usually fictional) series of letters and other documents to convey the plot of the story. Although epistolary works can be considered multiple-person narratives, they also can be classified separately, as they arguably have no narrator at all—just an author who has gathered the documents together in one place. One example is [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]],'' which is a story written in a sequence of letters. Another is [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', which tells the story in a series of diary entries, letters and newspaper clippings. ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]] (Dangerous Liaisons), ''by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]], is again made up of the correspondence between the main characters, most notably the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. Langston Hughes does the same thing in a shorter form in his story "Passing", which consists of a young man's letter to his mother.

=== Third-person voices ===
The third-person narrative voices are narrative-voice techniques employed solely under the category of the third-person view.

==== {{anchor|omni3}}Third-person, omniscient&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ====
Historically, the ''third-person omniscient'' (or simply ''omniscient'') perspective has been the most commonly used in narrative writing; it is seen in countless classic novels, including works by [[Charles Dickens]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Eliot]]. A story in this narrative mode is presented by a narrator with an overarching point of view, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Herman |first1=David |last2=Jahn |first2=Manfred |last3=Ryan |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory |year=2005 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-28259-8 |page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sometimes even takes a subjective approach. One advantage of omniscience is that this mode enhances the sense of objective reliability (that is, truthfulness) of the plot. The third-person omniscient narrator is the least capable of being unreliable – although the character of omniscient narrator can have its own personality, offering judgments and opinions on the behavior of the story characters.

In addition to reinforcing the sense of the narrator as reliable (and thus of the story as true), the main advantage of this mode is that it is eminently suited to telling huge, sweeping, epic stories, and/or complicated stories involving numerous characters. The disadvantage of this mode is the increased distance between the audience and the story, and the fact that – when used in conjunction with a sweeping, epic "cast-of-thousands" story – characterization tends to be limited, thus reducing the reader's ability to identify with or sympathize with the characters. A classic example of both the advantages and disadvantages of this mode is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==== Third-person, subjective ====
The ''third-person subjective'' is when the narrator conveys the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of one or more characters. If there is just one character, it can be termed ''third-person limited'', in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character (often the [[protagonist]]) as in the first-person mode, except still giving personal descriptions using "he", "she", "it", and "they", but not "I". This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]'', [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]'', or Santiago in [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''). Certain third-person omniscient modes are also classifiable as "third person, subjective" modes that switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters.

This style, in both its limited and omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective during the 20th century. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th-century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the "over the shoulder" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in-depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'', or [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.

The [[focal character]], [[protagonist]], [[antagonist]], or some other character's thoughts are revealed through the narrator. The reader learns the events of the narrative through the perceptions of the chosen character.

==== Third-person, objective ====
The ''third-person objective'' employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode, outside of fiction, is often employed by newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a "fly-on-the-wall" or "camera lens" approach that can only record the observable actions but does not interpret these actions or relay what thoughts are going through the minds of the characters. Works of fiction that use this style emphasize characters acting out their feelings observably. Internal thoughts, if expressed, are given voice through an aside or soliloquy. While this approach does not allow the author to reveal the unexpressed thoughts and feelings of the characters, it does allow the author to reveal information that not all or any of the characters may be aware of. A typical example of this so-called ''camera-eye perspective'' is ''[[Hills Like White Elephants]]'' by [[Ernest Hemingway]].

This narrative mode is also called the ''third-person dramatic'' because the narrator, like the audience of a drama, is neutral and ineffective toward the progression of the plot—merely an uninvolved onlooker. It was also used around the mid-20th century by French novelists writing in the ''nouveau roman'' tradition.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

==== Third-person, free/indirect ====
{{main|Free indirect speech}}
The third person indirect style or [[Free indirect speech|free indirect style]] is a method of presenting a character's voice freely and spontaneously in the middle of an otherwise third-person non-personal narrator.

==== Third-person, alternating ====

Many stories, especially in literature, alternate between the third person limited and third person omniscient. In this case, an author will move back and forth between a more [[omniscient]] third-person narrator to a more personal third-person limited narrator. Typically, like the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series and the books by [[George R. R. Martin]], a switch of third-person limited viewpoint on some character is done only at chapter boundaries. ''[[The Home and the World]]'', written in 1916 by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], is another example of a book switching among just three characters at chapter boundaries. In ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' series the point of view changes between characters at intervals.The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series is told in "third person limited" (in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character) for much of the seven novels. However, it deviates to omniscient on occasions, particularly during the opening chapters of later novels in the series, which switch from the limited view of the eponymous Harry to other characters (for example, Snape).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7475-8108-6|location=London|pages=6–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''narrative tense'' or ''narrative time'' determines the [[grammatical tense]] of the story, meaning whether it is presented as occurring before, during, or after the time of narration, that is, in the past, present, or future. In narration using the past tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring before the time at which the narrative was constructed or expressed to an audience or before the present moment; this is by far the most common tense in which stories are expressed. In the present tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring now—at the current moment—in [[present|real time]]. In English, this tense, also known as the "[[historical present]]", is more common in spontaneous conversational narratives than in written literature, though it is sometimes used in literature to give a sense of immediacy of the actions. A recent example of novels narrated in the present tense are those of the ''[[Hunger Games]]'' trilogy by [[Suzanne Collins]]. The future tense is the most rare, portraying the events of the plot as occurring some time after the present moment, in a time-period yet to come. Often, these upcoming events are described such that the narrator has foreknowledge (or supposed foreknowledge) of the future, so many future-tense stories have a [[prophecy|prophetic]] tone.

== Other narrative modes ==

=== Fiction-writing mode ===
''Narration'' has more than one meaning. In its broadest sense, narration encompasses all forms of storytelling, fictional or not: personal anecdotes, "true crime", and historical narratives all fit here, along with many other non-fiction forms. More narrowly, however, the term ''narration'' refers to all written fiction. In its most restricted sense, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator communicates directly to the reader.

Along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[description]], narration (broadly defined) is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. In the context of rhetorical modes, the purpose of narration is to tell a story or to narrate an event or series of events. Narrative may exist in a variety of forms: biographies, anecdotes, short stories, or novels. In this context, all written fiction may be viewed as narration.

Narrowly defined, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. But if the broad definition of narration includes all written fiction, and the narrow definition is limited merely to that which is directly communicated to the reader, then what comprises the rest of written fiction? The remainder of written fiction would be in the form of any of the other fiction-writing modes. Narration, as a fiction-writing mode, is a matter for discussion among fiction writers and writing coaches.

The ability to use the different points of view is one measure of a person's writing skill. The writing [[Marking scheme|mark schemes]] used for [[National Curriculum assessment]]s in [[England]] reflect this: they encourage the awarding of marks for the use of viewpoint as part of a wider judgment.

=== Other types and uses ===
In literature, ''person'' is used to describe the viewpoint from which the [[narrative]] is presented. Although second-person perspectives are occasionally used, the most commonly encountered are first and third person. ''Third person omniscient'' specifies a viewpoint in which readers are provided with information not available to characters within the story; without this qualifier, readers may or may not have such information.

In [[film|movies]] and [[video game]]s first- and third-person describe [[virtual camera system|camera viewpoints]]. The first-person is from a character's own perspective, and the third-person is the more familiar, "general" camera showing a scene. A so-called second-person may also be used to show a main character from a secondary character's perspective.

For example, in a [[horror film]], the first-person perspective of an [[antagonist]] could become a second-person perspective on a potential victim's actions. A third-person shot of the two characters could be used to show the narrowing distance between them.

In video games, a first-person perspective is used most often in the [[first-person shooter]] genre, such as in ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', or in simulations (racing games, flight [[Simulation video game|simulation games]], and such). Third-person perspectives on characters are typically used in all other games. Since the arrival of [[3D computer graphics]] in games it is often possible for the player to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at will; this is usually done to improve spatial awareness, but can also improve the accuracy of weapons use in generally third-person games such as the ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' franchise.

Text-based [[interactive fiction]] conventionally has descriptions written in the second person (though exceptions exist), telling the character what they are seeing and doing, such as [[Zork]]. This practice is also encountered occasionally in text-based segments of graphical games, such as those from [[Spiderweb Software]] which make ample use of second person flavor text in pop up text boxes with character and location descriptions.  [[Charles Stross]]'s novel [[Halting State]] was written in second person as an allusion to this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-441-01498-9|title=Halting State, Review|work=Publishers Weekly|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/05/and-another-thing.html|title=And another thing|author=Charles Stross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Correggio-(antonio-allegri)-madonna-del-latte-36018-p.jpg|thumb|300px|''Nursing Madonna with an Angel'']]
'''''Nursing Madonna with an Angel''''' is an oil on panel painting by [[Correggio]], painted around 1524 and now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Giuseppe Adani, ''Correggio pittore universale'', Silvana Editoriale, Correggio 2007. {{ISBN|9788836609772}}&lt;/ref&gt; It measures 68.5 by 87 cm and belongs to the [[Nursing Madonna]] or 'Madonna Lactans' genre.

==History==
The painting's style places it around the same time as the commission of paintings for the Del Bono Chapel in [[San Giovanni Evangelista (Parma)|San Giovanni Evangelista]] abbey church, that is at the start of the 1530s. Nothing more is known about who commissioned it or when and the first documentary evidence for it is a 1603 inventory of the [[Aldobrandini]] collection in Rome, where it was probably admired by [[Federico Barocci]] and later by the young [[Antony van Dyck]] and [[Pietro da Cortona]]. It was praised by father Ottonelli in his ''Trattato della Pittura e della Scultura, uso et abuso loro'' as a model to explain how a religious subject could succeed unlike a secular one. According to Ottonelli, the main Roman cardinals of the 17th century competed to possess the ''Nursing Madonna''. There is an engraving of it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correggioarthome.it/Sezione.jsp?idSezione=173&amp;idSezioneRif=54|title=Lelio Orsi, Madonna col Bambino e i Santi Andrea e Giuda, XVI sec. - Correggio ART HOME|first=Netribe|last=srl|website=www.correggioarthome.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a drawing of it by [[Lelio Orsi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correggioarthome.it/Sezione.jsp?idSezione=106&amp;idSezioneRif=54|title=Anonimo, Madonna del latte, da Correggio, XVI sec. - Correggio ART HOME|first=Netribe|last=srl|website=www.correggioarthome.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Greek myth (personified)}}
In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Oneiroi''' (/ˈɒniːɾi/) or '''Oneiri''' ({{lang|grc|Ὄνειροι}}, "Dreams") were dreams persomified.

== Family ==
According to [[Hesiod]], they were the sons of [[Nyx]] (Night) and the brothers of [[Hypnos]] (Sleep), [[Thanatos]] (Death), [[Geras]] (Old Age), the [[Moirai]], three goddesses of destiny, and other beings, all produced via [[parthenogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%98%CE%B5%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%B1][[Theogony]], 211–225&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Cicero]] follows this tradition, but describes the sons of Nyx as fathered by [[Erebus]] (Darkness).&lt;ref&gt;[[De natura deorum]], 3,17&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Euripides]] calls them instead sons of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Earth) and pictures them as black-winged [[daemon (mythology)|daemons]].{{clarify|date=January 2010|In which of his works does Euripides say this?}}

== Mythology ==

===In the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey''===
In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', an Oneiros is pictured as summoned by [[Zeus]], receiving from him spoken instructions, and then going to the camp of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] and entering the tent of [[Agamemnon]] to urge him to warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%99%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%AC%CF%82/%CE%92 ''Iliad'', II, 1-35]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Odyssey]]'' speaks of the land of dreams as past the streams of [[Oceanus]], close to where the spirits of the dead are led ([[Hades]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'', [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0135:book=24:card=1 XXIV, 11-14]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Statius]] pictures the Dreams as attending on slumbering Hypnos (Somnus in Latin) in a cave in that region.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thebaid]], [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/statius/theb10.shtml X, 84-117]&lt;/ref&gt;

In another passage of the ''Odyssey'', dreams (not personified) are spoken of, by a double play on words, as coming through a gate of horn if true (a play on the Greek words for "horn" and "fulfil") or a gate of ivory if false (a play on the Greek words for "ivory" and "deceive"). For this image and its echoes in later literature, see [[Gates of horn and ivory]].

===In the ''Metamorphoses''===
Related figures are the thousand sons, that the [[Latin]] poet [[Ovid]] gave to [[Somnus]] the Roman god of sleep. Ovid named three of the sons of Somnus: [[Morpheus]], who appears in human guise, [[Phobetor|Icelos / Phobetor]], who appears as beasts, and [[Phantasos]], who appears as inanimate objects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.633&amp;ndash;643].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Whatitmeans wsf2008.jpg|thumb|right|Panel discussion "What it Means to Be Human" at the 2008 [[World Science Festival]] in [[New York City]]]]
A '''science festival''' is a [[festival]] that showcases [[science]] and [[technology]] with the same freshness and flair that would be expected from an [[art festival|arts]] or [[music festival]]. Events can be varied, including [[lectures]], [[exhibition]]s, [[workshop]]s, live demonstrations of [[experiment]]s, [[guided tour]]s, and [[panel discussion]]s.  There may also be events linking science to the arts or history, such as plays, dramatised readings, and musical productions. The core content is that of science and technology, but the style comes from the world of the arts.

==History==
The modern concept of a science festival comes from the city of [[Edinburgh]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Background to science festivals | work=Orkney International Science Festival website | url=http://www.oisf.org/info/about-oisf/background| accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of [[Glasgow]] as European Capital of Culture for 1990 took Edinburgh by surprise and stimulated it to rebrand itself as a city of science, building on the success of a series of big urban developments led by its Economic Development Department. A senior member of the development team, Ian Wall, proposed that Edinburgh should highlight its new image by complementing its world-famous autumn arts festival with a new type of spring event for which he coined the phrase 'science festival'. Reaction was mixed, with some organisations doubting whether science could be packaged in an arts format. Even so, the city put resources behind the idea, appointing a director and project team, and in April 1989 the first [[Edinburgh International Science Festival]] took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Science festival gets ready to reveal Big Ideas | work=The Scotsman (online edition) | url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1049&amp;id=75902007 | accessdate=2007-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edinburgh's success led to the development of science festivals in many other parts of the world. The [[British Science Association]] restructured its annual meeting, originally established in 1831 as a discussion forum for scientists, to turn it into the British Science Festival of today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The history of the BA Festival of Science | url=http://www.the-ba.net/the-ba/Events/FestivalofScience/AboutFOS/HistoryoftheFestival/index.html | work=BA website | accessdate=2007-02-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070220100717/http://www.the-ba.net/the-ba/Events/FestivalofScience/AboutFOS/HistoryoftheFestival/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The town of [[Cheltenham]]—famous for its jazz, music, and literature festivals— added science to its portfolio with the creation of the [[Cheltenham Science Festival]] in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

As science organizations and funding bodies put ever more emphasis on [[outreach (science)|outreach]] to foster public understanding both of the results and the wider relevance of science, recent years have seen the creation of a number of new science festivals. An umbrella organization for European science festivals and other science communication events, the European Science Events Association (EUSEA), was formed in 2001 and now has approximately 100 member organizations from 36 different countries.

The concept spread to [[Sweden]] in 1997 with [[The International Science Festival in Gothenburg]] which is an annual [[festival]] in central [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]] with thought provoking science activities for the public. The festival is visited by about {{nowrap|{{formatnum:100000}} people}} each year.&lt;ref name=vgforsok&gt;[http://www.vartgoteborg.se/prod/sk/vargotnu.nsf/1/utbildning,varldsrekordforsok_inleder_goteborgs_tolfte_vetenskapsfestival vartgoteborg.se - Världsrekordförsök inleder Göteborgs tolfte vetenskapsfestival], Vårt Göteborg, 11 april 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the largest popular science event in [[Sweden]]&lt;ref name=festhome&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061101015134/http://www.goteborg.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=1601 goteborg.com - Festivalens hemsida] (archivelink 2006-11-01)&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the largest popular science events in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=fof08&gt;[http://www.fof.se/index.lasso?id=08364c Forskning och framsteg, 3/08 sid 64] (dead link 2012-04-24)&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of science festivals within the United States is relatively recent. One of the earliest examples is [[Wonderfest]], an annual [[Bay Area]] science festival that began in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Archive of Wonderfest Dialogues | url=http://wonderfest.org/wonderfest-dialogue-archive/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the annual meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] includes a number of public events. Focusing on one particular science, the physics festival "Mastering the Mysteries of the Universe", was held in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, in 1999 in association with the centennial of the [[American Physical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Mcdonald|first=Kim A.|url=http://www.entersci.com/che.html|newspaper= The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=2 April 1999|title=Science Entertainment: APS Centennial Celebration|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}; details of the festival programs and speakers can be found [http://web.gc.cuny.edu/sciart/festival/index.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2004, there has been a science festival in Pittsburgh (the SciTech festival; from 2005 on known as the SciTech Spectacular), and new science festivals have been held in Cambridge, Massachusetts (the [[MIT Museum#Cambridge Science Festival|Cambridge Science Festival]], first held in April 2007);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Shapiro | first=Gary | title=New York, Cambridge To Host Citywide Science Festivals | work=New York Sun | url=http://www.nysun.com/article/40004 | accessdate=2007-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in New York City (the [[World Science Festival]] held at the end of May 2008);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/arts/03fest.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=3 April 2008|title=Coming to New York, a Science Event for the Masses|pages=E2|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2009, San Diego hosted the first west coast science festival, the San Diego Science Festival founded by Larry Bock.

{{As of|2009}} the Science Festival Alliance, a consortium of major festivals formed with a 3-year NSF grant, has supported the growth of independent regional science festivals, with an initial emphasis on celebration in communities throughout the US.

In September 2010, the [[North Carolina Science Festival]] became the first statewide science festival in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=N.C. Science Festival kicks off this weekend|url=http://wraltechwire.com/business/tech_wire/biotech/blogpost/8261459/|publisher=WRAL Tech Wire|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; presenting more than 400 events across the state over a two-week span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NC Science Festival 2010 Final Report|url=http://moreheadplanetarium.org/files/NCSF_2010_Final_Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second NC Science Festival was held April 13–29, 2012, and the festival is now an annual event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NC Science Festival|url=http://www.ncsciencefestival.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morehead Planetarium and Science Center]] at [[UNC-Chapel Hill]] founded the North Carolina Science Festival and continues to administer it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Carolina Science Festival is gearing up for spring|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCnk4K1zuSY&amp;feature=youtu.be|publisher=WRAL Tech Wire|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2010, the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival]] was the "country’s first national science festival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=USA Science &amp; Engineering Festival | work=USA Science and Engineering Festival website | url=http://usasciencefestival.org | accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This national emphasis was based partly on encouraging local events to coincide with the major event in Washington DC.

Festivals can vary greatly in size and scope.  A university might stage a small festival in its hometown. On the other end of the scale, the 2006 [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] Festival of Science held on September 2–9 in [[Norwich]], England, was attended by more than 174,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;

==Typical festival events==
Science festivals feature a wide variety of events. A typical format for a science festival is to have a series of lectures, with topics ranging from cutting-edge research to unusual perspectives on science. For instance, the 2007 Edinburgh festival "Big Ideas" series included talks on what makes [[racing car]]s fast, the [[molecule|molecular]] basis of food preparation, the [[neurobiology]] of [[love]] and [[beauty]], and the properties of [[quark]]s. Most science festivals include hands-on activities similar to those found in [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]]s. Another popular theme is the interaction of science and culture, including the arts.

Science festivals are also aimed at playing an important, if informal part in [[secondary education|secondary]] [[science education]].  Many have events specifically aimed at students and/or teachers, such as workshops or offering curriculum-linked workshops, and science shows to regional schools throughout the year.

'''Stellar engineering''' is a type of [[engineering]] (currently a form of [[exploratory engineering]]) concerned with creating or modifying [[star]]s through artificial means.

While humanity does not yet possess the technological ability to perform stellar engineering of any kind, stellar manipulation (or husbandry), requiring substantially less technological advancement than would be needed to create a new star, could eventually be performed in order to stabilize or prolong the lifetime of a star, mine it for useful material (known as [[star lifting]]) or use it as a direct energy source. Since a civilization advanced enough to be capable of manufacturing a new star would likely have vast material and energy resources at its disposal, it almost certainly wouldn't ''need'' to do so.

==In science fiction==
Many [[science fiction]] authors have explored the possible applications of stellar engineering, among them [[Iain Banks|Iain M Banks]], [[Larry Niven]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]].

In the novel series Star Carrier by [[Ian Douglas (author)|Ian Douglas]] the Sh’daar species merge many stars to make blue giants, which then explode to become black holes. These perfectly synchronized black holes form a [[Tippler Cyclinder]] called the Texagu Resh gravitational anamoly. 

In the novel series ''[[The Book of the New Sun|The Book of The New Sun]]'' by [[Gene Wolfe]]'','' the brightness of Urth's sun seems to have been reduced by artificial means.

In the season 3 (1989) episode "Take Me to Your Leader" of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' cartoon]], [[Krang]], [[Shredder (TMNT)|Shredder]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] use a ''Solar Siphon'' to aim towards the [[Sun]], and store the solar energy into compact batteries, freezing the [[Earth]] making it too cold for people to resist them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart033.htm Ninjaturtles - ''Take Me to Your Leader'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In episode 12 of [[Stargate Universe]], Destiny was dropped prematurely out of FTL by an uncharted star that the crew determines to be artificially created and younger than 200 million years old with an [[Earth]]-sized planet containing a biosphere exactly like Earth's being the only planet in the system.

In [[Doctor Who]], there is an advanced race of being known as Time Lords, who through the use of advanced stellar manipulation, convert a nearby star into a black hole usable for powering their planet. The Tardis, the ship The Doctor (a renegade Time Lord) flies is actually built around and thus contains an artificially created star, providing the power needed to travel through time and space. "It's bigger on the inside"

In [[Firefly (TV series)]], set 500 years in the future, several [[gas giant]]s are "Helioformed" to create viable suns for the surrounding planets and moons.

In the ''[[Space Empires]]'' series the last available technology for research is called Stellar Manipulation. In addition to the ability to create and destroy stars, this branch also gives a race the ability to create and destroy [[black hole]]s, [[wormhole]]s, [[nebula]]e, [[planet]]s, [[ringworld]]s and [[Dyson sphere|sphereworlds]]. Just as described above, this technology is so advanced that once the player has the ability to use them, they usually don't need them anymore. This is even more the case with the last two; once one of these megastructures is complete, the race controlling the ringworld or sphereworld has almost unlimited resources, usually leading to defeat of the others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.spaceempires.net/index.php/Stellar_Manipulation_%28SEIV%29 Stellar Manipulation (SEIV)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The saga of the seven suns|The Saga of the Seven Suns]]'', by Kevin J. Anderson, humans are able to convert gas giant planets into stars through the use of a "Klikiss Torch". This device creates a wormhole between two points in space, allowing a neutron star to be dropped into the planet and ignite stellar nuclear fusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5473">'''Student Approaches to Learning''' is a theory that students will take a different approach to how they study, depending upon the perceived objectives of the [[Course (education)|course]] they are studying.

The theory was developed from the clinical studies of two educational psychologists, [[Ference Marton]] and [[Roger Säljö]], who found that students, in relation to any given learning task, can be divided into two distinct groups:

* those who took an [[understanding]]&lt;ref&gt;Also called [[intellection]].&lt;/ref&gt; approach to learning,
* and those who took a reproduction approach to learning.

These are commonly referred to as the "deep" and "surface" approaches.

In a study conducted by Marton and Säljö,&lt;ref&gt;Marton F. and Säljö R. (1976) On qualitative differences in learning. I – Outcome and Process’ British Journal of Educational Psychology 46, pp. 4-11.&lt;/ref&gt; students read a 1500-word article, about which they were later questioned by an interviewer. In the interviews, students were asked about what they remembered, how they felt about the task, and how they had approached the task. Analysis of the interviews showed that the students could be divided into two distinct groups:

* those who adopted a "deep" approach to learning engaged in an active process to reflect and integrate information in order to understand material being taught.
*"deep" approach recognized by a sub-scale which involves “(1) seeking meaning, (2) relating ideas, (3) using evidence, and having (4) an interest in ideas”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tait|first=H.|last2=Entwistle|first2=N.|date=January 1996|title=Identifying students at risk through ineffective study strategies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00129109|journal=Higher Education|language=en|volume=31|issue=1|pages=97–116|doi=10.1007/bf00129109|issn=0018-1560}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* those who adopted a "surface" approach to learning focused on trying to cope with the task assigned, and visualizes the course as burden, therefore uses memorization of information which then leads to a limited learning understanding.
*"surface" approach recognized to have sub-scale which involve “1) unrelated memorizing of information, (2) confining learning of the subject to the syllabus (syllabus-boundless), and (3) a fear of failing” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.
 
These findings were corroborated by the laboratory studies of [[G. Pask]] and co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;Pask G.(1976) Styles and Strategies of Learning British Journal of Educational Psychology 46, pp. 128-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Pask referred to the two groups of students as "holists" and "serialists." Holists have a broad focus and see their task in [[Context (language use)|context]], using analogies and illustrations. Serialists look at details and at steps in an argument. 

Researchers later proposed the “strategic approach or achievement approach” those individuals who try to attain the maximum grade by studying in an organized fashion utilizing time-management skill &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Entwistle|first=Noel|last2=Hanley|first2=Maureen|last3=Hounsell|first3=Dai|date=July 1979|title=Identifying distinctive approaches to studying|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01680525|journal=Higher Education|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=365–380|doi=10.1007/bf01680525|issn=0018-1560}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   

Using the following sub-scale: “(1) organized study, (2) time management, (3) being alert to assessment demands, (4) achieving high grades, and (5) monitoring effectiveness” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

Later, Entwistle and McCune (2004) suggest that the strategic approach is an approach to studying rather than an approach to learning but when combined with the deep approach, students seem to show successful academic performance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Entwistle|first=Noel|last2=McCune|first2=Velda|date=December 2004|title=The Conceptual Bases of Study Strategy Inventories|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10648-004-0003-0|journal=Educational Psychology Review|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=325–345|doi=10.1007/s10648-004-0003-0|issn=1040-726X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Learning approaches and phenomenography==
Marton has also been involved in the development of [[phenomenography]], a qualitative research methodology.  Phenomenography seeks to create a detailed understanding of people's experiences and thoughts.

==Learning approaches vs. learning styles==
Learning approaches are not the same as [[learning styles]]. Students will use different learning approaches for different tasks.

Learning approaches are not inherent personality traits; they are produced by the interaction of the student with specific learning tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Laurillard D. (1979) The Process of Student Learning Higher Education 8, pp. 395-409.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurillard D. (1997) Ch. 11 in F. Marton, D. Hounsell, and N. Entwistle, The Experience of Learning: Implications for Teaching and Studying in Higher Education (Edinburgh, Scottish Academic Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taiwanese units of measurement''' ({{zh|t=臺制|p=Táizhì|poj=Tâi-chè}}) are the customary and traditional [[Units of measurement|units of measure]] used in [[Taiwan]].  Many of the units derive from [[Japanese units of measurement]] and have similar names as [[Chinese units of measurement]] but different conversions than in [[mainland China]] or [[Hong Kong]].  In some cases these units are used exclusively, in some cases alongside official [[International System of Units|metric (SI)]] units, and in other cases they have been supplanted by metric units.  [[Linguistics|Linguistically]], practically all Taiwanese units of measure are [[Chinese classifier]]s used to [[classifier (linguistics)|classify]] [[nouns]].

==Length==
Linear measure in Taiwan is largely metric but some units derived from traditional Japanese units of measurement remain in use as a legacy of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]].

{|  class="wikitable"
! Unit || Definition || Basis
|-
| 1 Taiwanese inch ({{zh|c={{linktext|寸}}|p=cùn|poj=chhùn|labels=no}}) || 3.030{{nbsp}}cm || Japanese ''[[Cun (unit)|sun]]''
|-
| 1 Taiwanese foot ({{zh|c={{linktext|尺}}|p=chǐ|poj=chhioh|labels=no}}) || 30.30{{nbsp}}cm || Japanese ''[[Shaku (unit)|shaku]]''
|}

==Area==
[[File:10-Phêng Apartment.JPG|thumb|200px|An advertisement from [[IKEA]] for a 10-''ping'' apartment]]

Unlike with other measures, area continues to be almost commonly measured with traditional units. The principal unit for measuring the floorspace of an office or apartment, the ''ping'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|坪}}|p=píng|poj=pêⁿ / pîⁿ / phêⁿ / phîⁿ / phiâⁿ / phêng|labels=no}}) derives from the Japanese ''[[Japanese units of measurement#Area|tsubo]]'', the base unit of the Japanese area. Taiwanese units of [[land measurement]] derive from both traditional [[Dutch units of measurement|Dutch]] and Japanese measurements.  The principal unit of land measure, the ''jia'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|甲}}|p=jiǎ|poj=kah|labels=no}}), derives from the obsolete Dutch ''[[morgen]]'', which was introduced during Taiwan's [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch era]]. The ''li'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|犁}}|p=lí|poj=lê|labels=no}}) represented the area that could be farmed by one man with one ox and one plow in one day.

*1&amp;nbsp;''ping'' = 36&amp;nbsp;square ''chi'' = {{convert|3.306|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}
*1&amp;nbsp;''mu'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|畝}}|p=mǔ|poj=bó͘|labels=no}}) = 30&amp;nbsp;''ping'' = {{convert|99.2|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}
*1&amp;nbsp;''jia'' = 2,934&amp;nbsp;''ping'' = {{convert|0.9699|hectare|acre}}{{sfnp|MOE|2011|loc=#1857}}
*1&amp;nbsp;''li'' = 5&amp;nbsp;''jia''  = {{convert|4.8496|hectare|acre}}

Officially, land area is measured in [[hectare]]s and [[square kilometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=zh:《中華民國統計資訊網》縣市重要統計指標查詢系統網|url=http://statdb.dgbas.gov.tw/pxweb/Dialog/statfile9.asp|accessdate=25 July 2016|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volume==
Volume measure in Taiwan is largely metric, with common units such as liter and milliliter.

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

==Mass==
[[Image:Sam-ho-chhi.jpg|thumb|Fruit sold in [[catty|catties]] in a Taiwanese market]]
Packaged goods in Taiwan largely use metric measurements but bulk foodstuffs sold in [[wet market]]s and [[supermarket]]s are typically measured with units derived from traditional [[Japanese_units_of_measurement#Mass|Japanese units of mass]], which are similar but not equivalent to corresponding [[Chinese_units_of_measurement#Mass|Chinese units of mass]]. 

*1&amp;nbsp;[[Cash (unit)|cash]] ({{zh|c=釐|p=lí|poj=lî|labels=no}}) = 37.5&amp;nbsp;[[milligram|mg]]
*1&amp;nbsp;[[candareen]] ({{zh|c=分|p=fēn|poj=hun|labels=no}}) = 10&amp;nbsp;cash = 375&amp;nbsp;mg

'''Technogaianism''' (a [[portmanteau]] word combining "techno-" for [[technology]] and "gaian" for [[Gaia philosophy]]) is a [[bright green environmentalist]] stance of active support for the research, development and use of [[emerging technologies|emerging and future technologies]] to help restore [[Earth]]'s [[Natural environment|environment]]. Technogaians argue that developing safe, [[clean technology|clean]], [[alternative technology]] should be an important goal of [[environmentalist]]s.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"&gt;{{cite book| author = Hughes, James| title = [[Citizen Cyborg]]: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future| publisher = Westview Press| year = 2004| isbn = 0-8133-4198-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

This point of view is different from the default position of [[Radical environmentalism|radical environmentalists]] and a common opinion that all technology necessarily degrades the environment, and that [[environmental restoration]] can therefore occur only with [[neo-luddism|reduced reliance on technology]]. Technogaians argue that technology gets cleaner and more efficient with time. They would also point to such things as [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]]s to demonstrate that developments do not have to come at the environment's expense. More directly, they argue that such things as [[nanotechnology]] and [[biotechnology]] can directly reverse [[environmental degradation]]. [[Molecular nanotechnology]], for example, could [[List of solid waste treatment technologies|convert garbage in landfills into useful materials and products]], while biotechnology could lead to novel [[List of nuclear waste treatment technologies|microbes that devour hazardous waste]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

While many environmentalists{{Who|date=January 2015}} still contend that ''most'' technology is detrimental to the environment, technogaians point out that it has been in humanity's best interests to exploit the environment mercilessly until fairly recently. This sort of behaviour follows accurately to current understandings of [[punctuated equilibrium|evolutionary systems]], in that when new factors (such as foreign [[species]] or [[mutant]] [[subspecies]]) are introduced into an [[ecosystem]], they tend to maximise their own [[resource consumption]] until either, ''a)'' they reach an equilibrium beyond which they cannot continue unmitigated growth, or ''b)'' they become extinct. In these models, it is ''completely impossible'' for such a factor to totally destroy its host environment, though they may precipitate [[ecological crisis|major ecological transformation]] before their ultimate eradication.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Technogaians believe humanity has currently reached just such a threshold, and that the only way for human civilization to continue advancing is to accept the tenets of technogaianism and limit future exploitive exhaustion of [[natural resource]]s and minimize further [[sustainable development|unsustainable development]] or face the widespread, ongoing [[Holocene extinction event|mass extinction of species]].&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Michael Rosenzweig|Rosenzweig, Michael]]| title = Win-Win Ecology: How The Earth's Species Can Survive In The Midst of Human Enterprise| publisher = Clarendon Press| year = 2005| isbn = 0-19-515604-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destructive effects of modern civilization can be mitigated by technological solutions, such as using nuclear power. Furthermore, technogaians argue that only science and technology can help humanity be aware of, and possibly develop counter-measures for, [[risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth]] such as a possible [[Asteroid impact avoidance|impact event]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; 

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] mentions Walter Truett Anderson, author of ''To Govern Evolution: Further Adventures of the Political Animal'', as an example of a technogaian political philosopher;&lt;ref name="Anderson 1987"&gt;{{cite book| author = Anderson, Walter Truett| title = To Govern Evolution: Further Adventures of the Political Animal| publisher = Harcourt| year = 1987| isbn = 0-15-190483-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that technogaianism applied to [[environmental management]] is found in the [[reconciliation ecology]] writings such as [[Michael Rosenzweig]]'s ''Win-Win Ecology: How The Earth's Species Can Survive In The Midst of Human Enterprise'';&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005"/&gt; and considers [[Bruce Sterling]]'s [[Viridian design movement]] to be an exemplary technogaian initiative.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterling 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = [[Bruce Sterling|Sterling, Bruce]] | title = Viridian: The Manifesto of January 3, 2000|    year = 2001 | url = http://www.viridiandesign.org/manifesto.html| accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theories of English writer Fraser Clark may be broadly categorised as technogaian.{{according to whom|date=December 2014}} Clark advocated "balancing the hippie right brain with the techno left brain". The idea of combining technology and ecology were extrapolated at length by a South African eco-anarchist project in the 1990s. The [[Kagenna Magazine]] project aimed to combine technology, art and ecology in an emerging movement that could restore the balance between human and nature.

[[George Dvorsky]] suggests the sentiment of technogaianism is to heal the Earth, use [[sustainable technology]], and create ecologically diverse environments.&lt;ref name = dvorsky&gt;[http://www.sentientdevelopments.com/2013/02/7-best-case-scenarios-for-future-of.html?spref=tw George Dvorsky, 7 Best-Case Scenarios for the Future of Humanity, Sentient Developments, (Feb. 2, 2013).]&lt;/ref&gt; Dvorsky argues that defensive counter measures could be designed to counter the harmful effects of asteroid impacts, [[earthquakes]], and  [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]].&lt;ref name = dvorsky/&gt; Dvorksky also suggest that genetic engineering could be used to reduce the environmental impact humans have on the earth.&lt;ref name = dvorsky/&gt;

Technology facilities the sampling, testing and monitoring of various environments and ecosystems.  NASA uses space-based observations to conduct research on solar activity, sea level rise, the temperature of the atmosphere and the oceans, the state of the ozone layer, air pollution, and changes in sea ice and land ice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://climate.nasa.gov/nasa_role/ Global Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet: NASA's Role, Taking a global perspective on Earth's climate]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoengineering===
{{See also|Climate engineering}}

Climate engineering is a technogaian method that uses two categories of technologies- [[carbon dioxide removal]] and [[solar radiation management]]. Carbon dioxide removal addresses a cause of climate change by removing one of the [[greenhouse gases]] from the [[atmosphere]]. Solar radiation management attempts to offset effects of greenhouse gases by causing the [[Earth]] to absorb less [[solar radiation]].

[[Earthquake engineering]] is a technogaian method concerned with protecting society and the natural and man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to acceptable levels.&lt;ref name=Bozorgnia2004&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another example of a technogaian practice is an artificial [[closed ecological system]] used to test if and how people could live and work in a closed [[biosphere]], while carrying out [[scientific experiment]]s. It is in some cases used to explore the possible use of closed biospheres in [[space colonization]], and also allows the study and manipulation of a biosphere without harming Earth's.&lt;ref name="Gitelson, Livovsky &amp; MacElroy 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gitelson, I.

S. Matthew Liao, professor of philosophy and bioethics at [[New York University]], claims that the [[human impact on the environment]] could be reduced by [[Gene therapy|genetically engineering humans]] to have, a smaller stature, an intolerance to eating meat, and an increased ability to see in the dark, thereby using less lighting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/how-engineering-the-human-body-could-combat-climate-change/253981/ Ross Anderson, How Engineering the Human Body Could Combat Climate Change, The Atlantic, (March 12, 2012).]&lt;/ref&gt; Liao argues that human engineering is less risky than [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smatthewliao.com/2012/02/09/human-engineering-and-climate-change/ S.

[[Genetically modified food]]s have reduced the amount of [[herbicide]] and [[insecticide]] needed for cultivation. The development of glyphosate-resistant ([[Roundup Ready]]) plants has changed the herbicide use profile away from more environmentally persistent herbicides with higher toxicity, such as [[atrazine]], [[metribuzin]] and [[alachlor]], and reduced the volume and danger of herbicide runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18268303 | doi=10.2134/jeq2006.0540 | volume=37 | issue=2 | year=2008 | pages=401–8 |vauthors=Shipitalo MJ, Malone RW, Owens LB | title = Impact of Glyphosate-Tolerant Soybean and Glufosinate-Tolerant Corn Production on Herbicide Losses in Surface Runoff | journal = Journal of Environment Quality| url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=21799&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Beginnings===
Tere was raised in [[Los Angeles, California]], where  her perspective was shaped and influenced by the city itself, along with the music, imagery and pop culture of the late 1960s. She spent her teen years going to clubs on the [[Sunset Strip]] to see musicians like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Mike Bloomfield|Michael Bloomfield]] and [[Jim Morrison]] perform. &lt;!-- By the 1970s, she had made her own mark on pop culture. --&gt;

===Career===
Rocker [[Jim Morrison|Jim Morrison's]] girlfriend, [[Pamela Courson]], discovered Tere and recruited her to design for her  [[La Cienega Boulevard]] boutique, [[Themis]]. Simultaneously, Tere was hired as an apprentice by [[Young Edwardian]], then the most important junior fashion label in the country, to sketch designs in the back room. Six months later, she proved herself by designing a collection which sold tens of millions of dollars at retail stores such as [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], [[Bloomingdale's]], and [[Neiman-Marcus]]. Before reaching voting age, Tere herself had become a force in the [[fashion]] industry.

Tere caught the attention of [[Andy Warhol]] in Los Angeles. They invited her to visit the [[The Factory|Factory]], then at 33 Union Square West, when she came to New York. Soon she was writing for and being written about in [[Andy Warhol|Andy Warhol's]] ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview Magazine]]''. Warhol once described Tere as "looking like [[Hedy Lamarr]] and acting like [[Lucille Ball]]." Her passion for rock music segued into film, which resulted in her interviewing many prominent filmmakers for the magazine, such as [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Martin Scorsese]].

Next, she was cast in the [[black comedy]], ''[[Andy Warhol's Bad]]'' (1977), directed by Jed Johnson. She played the mother of an autistic child, which was a ground-breaking subject for film at the time.

Tere continued creating fashion trends (her designs garnered 24 covers of ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'') and setting trends in her personal life with her idiosyncratic apartment, which was featured in ''[[Architectural Digest]]'' and as an early collector of artist, [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]. [[Golden Age of Hollywood]] photographer, [[George Hurrell]], was brought out of retirement to photograph her.

She emerged from a hiatus to design cutting-edge fashions for the twenty-somethings of the 21st Century.  [[Paris Hilton]] was soon seen wearing Tere Tereba's latest designs for [[bebe stores]].

No longer active in the fashion world, Tereba has written a biography of the notorious Hollywood mob boss [[Mickey Cohen]] that delves into the Los Angeles underworld, titled ''Mickey Cohen: The Life and Crimes of L.A.'s Notorious Mobster.'' The book was released on May 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mickeycohenbook.com/ Mickey Cohen: The Life and Crimes of L.A.'s Notorious Mobster]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TheJoyOfMusic.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''The Joy of Music''''' is [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s first book, originally published in 1959 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. A highly acclaimed, bestselling work, it is still in print today.

In the book, Bernstein completely abandons the traditional academic style of books on classical music. Some of the chapters are cast in the style of conversations about music between Bernstein and several imaginary people. (One of these conversations contains Bernstein's thoughts on [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', a work he never conducted or recorded.) Other chapters of the book are made up of complete transcribed scripts of Bernstein's television music lectures of the 1950s, taken from the TV show ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]''. They include his famous dissection of the first movement of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]. But the published scripts rely heavily on printed musical illustrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKRLstZDYLMC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=The+Joy+of+Music#v=onepage&amp;q=Beethoven's+Fifth+Symphony&amp;f=false|title=The Joy of Music|date=27 August 2018|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|accessdate=27 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; so readers unfamiliar with music notation were once unable to appreciate them fully. However, all of Bernstein's ''Omnibus'' lectures have recently been released on DVD, so readers of ''The Joy of Music'' are now able to hear the musical examples they may have been unable to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002OVB9Z8|title=Omnibus: Leonard Bernstein|date=1 July 2016|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program on jazz was also recorded on an LP and has been released on CD. The Beethoven's Fifth lecture has also been released on CD, but in an unfortunate format making it impossible to listen without hearing "feedback" in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000027O9|title=Beethoven: Symphony No. 5|date=16 June 1992|accessdate=27 August 2018|website=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yangju byeolsandae nori''' is [[Korea]]'s traditional mask drama which is the second most [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea]] after [[Jongmyo jerye]]. It is performed primarily in April (chopail), May (danoh), July (Basin) and August (Thanksgiving) and also sometimes in a ceremony which prays for rain. The name originates from the place where mask-playing started, [[Yangju]] province in Korea. It was the first mask play to be designated as an "Important Intangible Cultural Property".

==History==
According to the [[Culture of Korea|Korean official culture]] information service, Yangju byeolsandae nori was started by government officials working in Yangju province. In Yangju, a group of entertainers called Ttakttakyipae from [[Seoul|Hanyang]] came to perform every April and May but they frequently broke their promise and failed to put on a show. As a result, the officials in Yangju started to make their own mask drama and hold performances. Lee Eul-chuk was the main organiser of the show and the first to produce mask dramas in Yangju. At that time, Yangju was both a big town and transport hub, and also a city with many officials. So the Yangju byeolsandae nori become the special play that was performed by people living near the Yangju office.  Sandae nori is also called "sandi nori", "sanji nori" or "sandu nori" and originated from "sandae gabhee", a welcoming ceremony for Chinese [[diplomat]]s. It spread mainly from Seoul and [[Gyeonggi Province]] to Aeohgae (now [[Ahyeon-dong]]), [[Manrijae]], Gameundol (now [[Heukseokdong]]), [[Nokbeon]], [[Sajikgol]], [[Gupabal]], Nodes (now [[Noryangjin]]), [[Toegyewon]] and [[Uijeongbu]] but it is not performed in these regions any more. &lt;!--Byeolsandae nori named on this byeolsandae aeohgae, sajikgol, which in places nokbeon sandaenolyi words and it is not same because Byeolsandae is a improved style from the origin one.--Incomprehensible--&gt;

==Procedures==
Before the mask drama starts, a ceremony takes place praying for a good performance and traditional foods are served. These include jora, [[tteok]] and fruits organized in three colors, head of beef and leg of pork. Usually rich people and merchants in town paid the cost of the show and the performers were unpaid. The performance took place at Sagikgol, which is to the north of [[Bulgoksan (Seongnam)|Mount Bulgok]] in the town. There had been a [[Shamanism|shaman]] house there and props needed for the show were placed inside. There were no rules as to the exact times of performances but they usually started in the evening and ended at dawn the following day. Occasionally, it was shortened to three or four hours. The main instruments used in the performance were two [[piri]] (flute), one jeotdae, one [[haegeum]], one [[janggu]] and one buk which are all traditional Korean instruments. Kkwaenggari was added when it was needed and sometimes players danced with only piri and janggu. They used the rhythms of taryong or gutgurigok and the dance style was divided into geodeureumsik and kkaekkisik. Yangju byeolsandae nori is organized with mainly dancing to music like other [[talchum]], and it is divided into dance performance, miming and drama where the actors have set lines. The traditional characters include Sangjwa, lotus and nunkkeumjjeokyi, waejangnyeo, aesadang, somu, veteran, monkeys, haesanmo, podo Director and miyal grandma. Some roles do not have any words so only dancing and gesture are required but other roles have lines as well as dance and gesture. The typical [[Bongsan Talchum]] is in verse but in Yangju byeolsandae nori, the lines are in prose.

==Characters==
Yangju byeolsandae nori is organized with 32 characters but as some masks are used in two or three ways, only 22 masks are used during the performance. The 22 characters are two Sangjwa, scabies, four mokjung, yeonip, nunkkeumjjeokyi, wanbo, sinjubu, waejangnyeo, nojang, two Somu, maltuki, monkeys, Chwibari, one sanim, podo Director, sinhalahbi and miyal grandma.

'''Òmnium Cultural''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈɔmni.um kultuˈɾal}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omnium.cat|title=Òmnium Cultural|work=Òmnium Cultural|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Catalan association based in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. It was originally created in the 1960s to promote the [[Catalan language]] and spread Catalan culture.

Over the years it has increased its involvement in broader social issues; in 2012 it committed itself to [[Catalan independence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2012/10/30/catalunya/1351555256_662849.html|title=Òmnium adapta su ideario al secesionismo|author=Ediciones El País|work=EL PAÍS|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically demanding the right of [[self-determination]] for Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omnium.cat/whats-going-catalonia|title=What's going on in Catalonia?|work=Òmnium Cultural|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Òmnium Cultural was created on 11 July 1961 in the context of [[Francoist Spain]] when the institutional use of Catalan was forbidden. In 1963 the Francoist authorities closed down the association. Òmnium had to continue to exist as a clandestine association between 1963–1967. In 1967, after a long [[legal case]] before the Francoist courts, the association won its right to exist and was once again authorised.

In order to promote Catalan culture within the many limits of Francoism, Òmnium was the main creator and sponsor of various [[award]]s and [[literary award|literary contests]] for works published in Catalan, such as the ''Premi d'Honor de les Lletres Catalanes'' (1969). In the early 1970s it established the ''Nit de Santa Llúcia'' a festival of [[Catalan literature]] where three prizes are awarded: the ''Premi Sant Jordi'' ([[novel]]), the ''Premi [[Mercè Rodoreda]]'' ([[short story]]) and the ''Premi Carles Riba'' (poetry).

After the Francoist dictatorship ended in 1975, Òmnium continued its work promoting Catalan language and culture. Once democracy was restored, Òmnium supported and defended Catalan self-government, especially from the Spanish Constitutional Court's rejection of the new ''[[Estatut]]'' onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/the-constitutional-court-rejects-the-exclusion-of-its-president-requested-by-the-catalan-government|title=Catalan News Agency - The Constitutional Court rejects the exclusion of its President requested by the Catalan Government|author=Gaspar Pericay Coll|work=catalannewsagency.com|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One million people marched on 10 July 2010 in Barcelona calling for national self-determination in a [[2010 Catalan autonomy protest]] organised by Òmnium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0_J48VVurw&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PL5u49XPks3PkEXpEB32tKn4GYBDbVGGjY&amp;index=6|title=Catalan citizens protest for greater self-government (10-J)|date=13 July 2010|work=YouTube|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of the main organisations pressing for Catalan politicians to hold a [[Catalan self-determination referendum]] in 2017.

==Structure and funding==
Òmnium reached a membership of 115,000 in 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catalannews.com/society-science/item/viggo-mortensen-joins-catalonia-s-omnium-cultural|title=Viggo Mortensen joins Catalonia's Òmnium Cultural|last=Terol|first=Alan Ruiz|website=www.catalannews.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has nearly 40 regional offices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.omnium.cat/qui-som/seus-territorials|title=Òmnium Cultural - Seus territorials|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; besides the headquarters in Barcelona. In December 2015, [[Jordi Cuixart]] was elected president, by a large majority,  in elections in which 5,719 members participated, over 10% of the then membership of 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jordi Cuixart és proclamat nou president d'Òmnium | url = https://www.omnium.cat/noticia/jordi-cuixart-es-proclamat-nou-president-domnium|accessdate = 2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005–2012 the association received different grants from the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan government]] (Generalitat), including €1.4 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20120221/54258137724/govern-subvencion-omnium-cultural.html|title=El Govern hace pública una subvención de 1,4 millones a Òmnium Cultural|date=21 February 2012|work=LA VANGUARDIA|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the association announced that it would no longer receive funding from the Catalan government. In 2016, different local authorities gave grants to Òmnium, basically for local cultural activities, for a value of €144,404.12, out of a total income in 2016 of €4.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.omnium.cat/sites/default/files/gestio/02_qui_som/04_entitat/05_balanc/6672_omnium_cultural_20161.pdf
|title=Audited accounts of Òmnium Cultural 2016|author=Faura Casas, Auditors Consultors|date=16 June 2017|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the Generalitat officially named Omnium as a [[public interest]] body, thus automatically conferring a more favourable tax regime for the association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Muriel Casals releva a Jordi Porta al frente de Òmnium|url = http://elpais.com/diario/2010/03/21/catalunya/1269137245_850215.html|accessdate = 2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Òmnium Cultural cooperates with other organizations that share similar goals in other [[Catalan Countries|Catalan-speaking territories]]: [[Acció Cultural del País Valencià]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpv.cat/web/|title=Portada - Acció Cultural del País Valencià - ACPV|work=acpv.cat|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;(in the [[Valencian Community]]) and [[Obra Cultural Balear]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocb.cat/|title=OCB.CAT|work=ocb.cat|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in the [[Balearic Islands]]).

It was awarded the [[Creu de Sant Jordi]] by the Generalitat in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dogc.gencat.cat/ca/pdogc_canals_interns/pdogc_resultats_fitxa/?action=fitxa&amp;documentId=242713|title=Resultats i fitxa|website=Diari Oficial de la Generalitat de Catalunya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 Òmnium was condemned by the [[Audiencia Nacional (Spain)|Audiencia Nacional]], an exceptional high court, for the unauthorised use and deficient custody of [[personal data]], after its data had been stolen by a hacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ara.cat/politica/Assemblea_Nacional_Catalana-ANC-Omnium_Cultural-atac-Estat-multa-sancio-9-N-gigaenquesta_0_1471053079.html|title=Cop de l'Estat també a l'ANC i Òmnium: multa de 440.000 euros per la 'gigaenquesta'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a €200,000 sanction imposed by the Spanish agency responsible for [[data protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2015/11/20/564eedcc268e3e8b058b45f3.html|title=Protección de Datos sanciona a la ANC y a Òmnium por la 'gigaencuesta'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Òmnium Cultural had more than 128,000 members in October 2018.&lt;ref name="members_counter" /&gt;
