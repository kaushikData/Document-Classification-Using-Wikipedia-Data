'''Abdelaziz of Morocco''' (24 February 1878{{snd}}10 June 1943;&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Abd al-Aziz|edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There is a dispute on the exact date of birth with two dates given: Feb 24, 1878 or Feb 18, 1881, while Chisholm (1911) states 1880.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ar|عبد العزيز الرابع}}), also known as '''Mulai Abd al-Aziz IV''', succeeded his father [[Hassan I of Morocco]] as the [[Sultan of Morocco]] in 1894 at the age of sixteen and served in that position until he was deposed in 1908. He was a member of the [[Alaouite dynasty]].

==Accession to the throne==
By the action of [[Ba Ahmad bin Musa]], the [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] of [[Hassan I of Morocco]], Abd al-Aziz's accession to the [[sultanate]] was ensured with little fighting. Ba Ahmad became [[regent]] and for six years showed himself a capable ruler.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abd-el-Aziz IV|volume=1|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were strong rumors that he was poisoned.{{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

On his death in 1900 the regency ended, and Abd al-Aziz took the reins of government into his own hands and chose an [[Arabs|Arab]] from the south, [[El Menebhi]], as his chief adviser.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==Rule==
[[File:Abdulaziz - Sultan of Morocco.jpg|thumb|Sultan Abdelaziz]]
As urged by his [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]]&lt;ref&gt;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/01/02/101963574.pdf FIGHT EXPECTED AT FEZ.; Rebels Only Four Hours from Capital at Last Report. LONDON TIMES -- NEW YORK TIMES Special Cablegram. January 02, 1903,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Annual Cyclopaedia and Register of Important Events, Volume 19; Volume 34, D. Appleton, 1895, p.501&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Circassians|Circassian]] mother, the sultan sought advice and counsel from [[Europe]] and endeavored to act on it, but advice not motivated by a conflict of interest was difficult to obtain, and in spite of the unquestionable desire of the young ruler to do what was best for the country, wild extravagance both in action and expenditure resulted, leaving the sultan with a depleted exchequer and the confidence of his people impaired. His intimacy with foreigners and his imitation of their ways were sufficient to rouse strong popular opposition.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His attempt to reorganize the country's finances by the systematic levy of taxes was hailed with delight, but the government was not strong enough to carry the measures through, and the money which should have been used to pay the taxes was employed to purchase firearms instead. And so the benign intentions of Mulai Abd el-Aziz were interpreted as weakness, and Europeans were accused of having spoiled the sultan and of being desirous of spoiling the country.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

When [[United Kingdom|British]] engineers were employed to survey the route for a railway between [[Meknes]] and [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], this was reported as indicating the sale of the country outright. The strong opposition of the people was aroused, and a revolt broke out near the [[Algeria]]n frontier. Such was the state of things when the news of the [[Entente Cordiale|Anglo-French Agreement of 1904]] came as a blow to Abd-el-Aziz, who had relied on England for support and protection against the inroads of [[France]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; See also the [[Ion Perdicaris]] affair.

===Algeciras Conference===
{{Main|Algeciras Conference}}
[[File:Abdelaziz ben hassan.jpg|thumb|Sultan Abdelaziz in aristocratic regalia]]
On the advice of [[Germany]], Abdelaziz proposed an international conference at [[Algeciras]] in 1906 to consult upon methods of reform, the sultan's desire being to ensure a state of affairs which would leave foreigners with no excuse to interfere in the control of the country and thereby promote its welfare, which he had earnestly desired from his accession to power. This was not, however, the result achieved (see main article), and while on June 18 the sultan nonetheless ratified the resulting Act of the conference, which the country's delegates had found themselves unable to sign, the anarchic state  into which [[Morocco]] fell during the latter half of 1906 and the beginning of 1907 revealed the young ruler as lacking sufficient strength to command the respect of his turbulent subjects.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Rebellions===
In May 1907 the southern aristocrats, led by the head of the [[Glaoua]] tribe [[Si Elmadani El Glaoui]], invited [[Abdelhafid of Morocco|Abdelhafid]], an elder brother of Abdelaziz, and viceroy at [[Marrakech]], to become sultan, and the following August Abdelhafid was proclaimed sovereign there with all the usual formalities.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the meantime, the deaths of Europeans in [[Casablanca]] during a riot incited by European engineers' construction of a railroad over a Moroccan cemetery that June&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42954024|title=Morocco since 1830 : a history|last=R.|first=Pennell, C.|date=2000|publisher=Hurst &amp; Co.|isbn=1850654263|location=London|oclc=42954024|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; had led to the port's occupation by France. In September Abd-el-Aziz arrived at [[Rabat]] from Fez and endeavored to secure the support of the European powers against his brother. From [[France]] he accepted the grand cordon of the [[Légion d’honneur|Legion of Honour]], and was later enabled to negotiate a loan. This was seen as leaning to [[Christianity]] and aroused further opposition to his rule, and in January 1908 he was declared deposed by the [[ulema]] of Fez, who offered the throne to Hafid.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===End of rule===
After months of inactivity Abdelaziz made an effort to restore his authority, and quitting Rabat in July he marched on [[Marrakech]]. His force, largely owing to treachery, was completely overthrown on August 19 when nearing that city,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; and Abdelaziz fled to [[Settat]], within the [[France|French]] lines around Casablanca. In November he came to terms with his brother, and thereafter took up his residence in [[Tangier]] as a pensioner of the new sultan.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; However the exercise of Moroccan law and order continued to deteriorate under [[Abd al-Hafid of Morocco|Abdelhafid]], leading to the humiliating [[Treaty of Fez]] in 1912, in which European nations assumed many responsibilities for the sultanate, which was divided into three zones of influence.

==Exile and death==
Sultan Abdelaziz led a very active social but only semipolitical life in exile. During the Spanish annexation of Tangier in 1940, he acquiesced insofar as the Moroccan palace authorities called the "makhzen" played a significant role therein.

Abdelaziz died in Tangier in 1943.

==Legacy==
After the ex-sultan's sudden death in 1943, his body was transferred to French Morocco as desired by the [[Sultan Mohammed V]].

He was portrayed by [[Marc Zuber]] in the film ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'' (1975), a fictional version of the [[Ion Perdicaris]] affair.

'''Abdul-Halim Salamovich Sadulayev''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Abdul Khalim Saidullayev from Chechnya pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg|ˈ|ɑː|b|d|uː|l|_|k|ə|ˈ|l|iː|m|_|s|aɪ|d|ʊ|ˈ|l|aɪ|ɛ|v}} {{respell|AHB|dool|_|kə|LEEM|_|sy|duu|LY|ev}}; [[Chechen language|Chechen]]: Сайд-Iелийн Абусаламин кІант  Iабдул-Хьалим ''Sadulin Abusalamin-Kant Abdulhalim'', [[Russian language|Russian]]: Абдул-Халим Саламович Сайдулаев ''Abdul-Khalim Salamovich Saydulayev'') (2 June 1966 – 17 June 2006) was the fourth [[President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]]. Sadulayev served little more than a full year as President before being killed in a gun battle with [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] and [[Kadyrovtsy|pro-Russian Chechen forces]].

Sadulayev was the first [[Chechen people|Chechen]] rebel leader effectively attempting to unify the Islamic rebel forces outside Chechnya, as he had won pledges of loyalty not only from Chechen separatists, but also from [[Islamism|Islamist]] groups seeking the overthrow of the [[Kremlin]]'s authority across the [[North Caucasus]]; this formation became known as the [[Caucasian Front (Chechen War)|Caucasian Front]]. He was also credited with persuading radical [[warlord]] [[Shamil Basayev]] not to carry out any major terrorist attacks since [[Beslan school hostage crisis|Beslan]].

==Name==
There is considerable variation in writing his name in both English and Russian sources. His surname is variously written '''Sadulaev''', '''Sadulayev''', '''Saidulaev''', '''Saidulayev''', '''Saidullaev''', '''Saidullayev''' or '''Saydullayev'''; the first two of these seem to be favored by [[Insurgency|insurgent]] sources, while the others are favored by [[Russia]]n sources and Western media. His first name is also written '''Abdul-Khalim''', and is sometimes written with or without a hyphen. In Russian his name with surname is written Абдул-Халим Сайдуллаев or Абдул-Халим Сайдулаев or Абдул-Халим Садулаев, with or without the hyphen.

His full name given by the separatist [[website]] [[Kavkaz Center]] appears to be '''Abdul-Halim Abu-Salamovich Sadulayev''' (Абдул-Халим Абу-Саламович Садулаев).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Sadulayev was born into the Biltoy branch of the Ustradoi [[teip]], an influential clan in the town of [[Argun, Chechen Republic|Argun]] on the plains of central Chechnya to the east of [[Grozny]].http://www.waynakh.com/eng/2008/05/abdul-khalim-salamovich-sadullayev/  After growing up in Argun, he entered Grozny's [[university]] to study Chechen and Russian [[philology]], but had to break off his studies as the [[First Chechen War]] with the [[Russian Federation]] broke out in 1994. He joined an Argun [[militia]] to fight against the Russians as a volunteer fighter.

Sadulayev also studied Islam under local Islamic [[theologian]]s, and from 1996 began appearing regularly on Chechen television speaking about Islam. He lectured across Chechnya, and eventually ended up leading Argun's Muslim community as the town's [[Imam]]. Sadulayev made the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], the only time he is known to have left his homeland.

Sadulayev became the leader of the only Argun ''[[Jamia|jamaat]]'' in his city, which was known to carry out [[missionary]] activities, as well as policing the neighborhoods. Apart from their religious &amp; civil functions, most of the jamaats in Chechnya also represented military detachments formed to guard villages and towns against the Russian Military and bandits alike. During a standoff between a group of foreign radicals and Chechen authorities in 1998, Sadulayev sided against Khabib Abdurrakhman, a Jordanian leader of a small Foreign/Chechen jamaat who was amassing a militia &amp; advocating extreme violence against Russian and Non-Islamic Chechen peoples alike. After these events, Abdurrakhman was stripped of his Chechen citizenship and declared [[persona non grata]] in Chechnya; he died in 2001 while fighting in one of the jamaats as a regular soldier.

In 1999, [[Aslan Maskhadov]] appointed Sadulayev to a commission for constitutional [[Sharia]] reform, a commission then headed by [[Akhmad Kadyrov]], who would later reject the rebels and embrace [[Moscow]]. Maskhadov offered Sadulaev the position of the head of the Supreme Sharia Court of Chechnya, but Sadulaev turned down the offer, explaining that he did not have sufficient clerical knowledge to judge other people.

When the [[Second Chechen War]] started Sadulayev again returned to fighting, commanding the popular militia from [[Argun, Chechen Republic|Argun]]. Since 1999, Sadulaev had been one of Maskhadov's most loyal field commanders. In 2002, he was designated by Maskhadov to be his successor as president of [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]].

===Presidency===
Shortly following Maskhadov's death on 8 March 2005, the Chechen rebel council announced that Sadulayev had assumed Maskhadov's position, a move that was quickly endorsed by [[Shamil Basayev]], the Chechens' highest-profile [[guerrilla]] commander. After assuming power, Sadulayev called for expanding the Chechnya conflict into a "[[decolonization]]" of Muslim-dominated adjoining regions and adoption of a [[constitution]] based on Islamic law, or Sharia. He also strongly condemned [[hostage taking]]s and said that after the end of the war the new president should be [[democracy|democratically]] elected.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/06/c9ed22dd-6bb9-464b-85bf-37fbcb02140b.html Russia: New Chechen Resistance Leader Vows No More Hostage Takings] RFE/RL {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615160001/http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/06/c9ed22dd-6bb9-464b-85bf-37fbcb02140b.html |date=15 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadulayev had not only an ideological commitment to maintaining the conflict, but perhaps a personal one as well. Chechen insurgent sources claim that his wife was kidnapped in 2003 by Russian [[spetsnaz]] forces and killed by the [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] when attempts to buy her back failed. He had worked to eliminate terrorist violence and urged Basayev and other warlords to direct attacks on "legitimate targets" (including law enforcement [[officials]], [[Russian Federation|federal]] troops and local [[civil servants]] and their offices),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kavkaz.org.uk/eng/content/2005/09/16/4074.shtml Russia's tactics make Chechen war spread across Caucasus] Kavkaz Center {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101173754/http://www.kavkaz.org.uk/eng/content/2005/09/16/4074.shtml |date=1 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stressed that attacks on such targets should avoid injuring [[civilian]]s.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt; He appeared to have convinced Basayev, who was enlisted in the formation of the [[Caucasian Front (Chechen War)|Caucasian Front]], that giving up on civilian targets would help spread the insurgency across the North Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/chechnya_weekly/article.php?articleid=2373424 No Terrorist Acts in Russia Since Beslan: Whom to Thank?] Jamestown Foundation {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918223149/http://www.jamestown.org/chechnya_weekly/article.php?articleid=2373424 |date=18 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, Sadulayev announced a [[cabinet reshuffle]] targeting several top rebel representatives living abroad, including [[Akhmed Zakayev]], who was dismissed as deputy prime minister. Sadulayev also signed a decree ordering all his ministers to be based in Chechnya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/02/b49d528b-97b1-41a3-9c43-21b424de4849.html Russia: Chechen Rebel Leader Reshuffles Ministers] RFE/RL {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724121900/http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/02/b49d528b-97b1-41a3-9c43-21b424de4849.html |date=24 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On 17 June 2006, Sadulayev was killed in a gun battle with the FSB and pro-Moscow militiamen in Argun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/06/17/chechnya.rebel/index.html Report: Chechen Rebel chief killed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218161629/http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/06/17/chechnya.rebel/index.html |date=18 December 2007 }} CNN &lt;/ref&gt; According to the FSB chief [[Nikolai Patrushev]], two members of the federal forces were killed and five were wounded in a firefight in which Sadulayev and his [[bodyguard]] were killed, and two other rebels escaped. In August 2006, rebel commander [[Isa Muskiev]] said the federals and the ''[[kadyrovtsy]]'' lost five men killed in the shootout, one of them shot by Sadulayev personally, and three fighters escaped.

The body was later moved to [[Ramzan Kadyrov]]'s hometown of [[Tsentoroi]]. Kadyrov said an informant had tipped off police for drug money. Kadyrov said that his [[paramilitary]] police had wanted to capture Sadulayev but were forced to kill him when he resisted arrest, and also stated Sadulayev was in Argun organizing "a big terrorist attack" to coincide with the [[Group of Eight]] summit in [[St. Petersburg]] to take place in July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/news/hotspots/terror/18-06-2006/82150-Sadulayev-0 Terrorist leader Sadulayev killed in Chechnya was planning big terrorist act] ''Pravda'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420210636/http://english.pravda.ru/news/hotspots/terror/18-06-2006/82150-Sadulayev-0 |date=20 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The killing of Sheikh Abdul Halim was mentioned by leaders of the Moscow-backed official government of the province, claiming that the separatist forces there had been dealt a "[[decapitation|decapitating]]" blow "from which they will never recover."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/world/europe/18chechnya.html?ex=1308283200&amp;en=8912e421eef42532&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss Russian Troops Kill Leader of Chechen Separatists] ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, 18 June, Sadulayev was succeeded as head of the Chechen [[Resistance movement|resistance]] by the rebel vice-president and an active guerrilla commander [[Dokka Umarov]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/19/chechnya.nickpatonwalsh Chechnya rebels appoint new leader after killing] ''The Guardian'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111203430/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jun/19/chechnya.nickpatonwalsh |date=11 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 2006, the Russian [[human rights]] organization [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]] posted the findings of its investigation on the ''Kavkazky Uzel'' website. According to Memorial's version, Sadulayev's death was accidental; security officials did not know that he was in the house. Memorial reports that on 17 June, about 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., a group of 12 FSB officers and local policemen approached a possible rebel [[safe house]]. They immediately came under gunfire as they entered the yard. Two of the servicemen were killed, and the group retreated after throwing a [[hand grenade]] into a window of the house. The grenade blast killed Abdul-Halim.  This version is contradicted by the official account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=414&amp;issue_id=3774&amp;article_id=2371208 SADULAEV DEATH RESULT OF GOOD LUCK, NOT GOOD PLANNING] Jamestown Foundation {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918223211/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=414&amp;issue_id=3774&amp;article_id=2371208 |date=18 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Gonzalo Zulaica''' (10 January 1886 in [[San Sebastián]], Spain – 30 August 1956), better known by his [[pen name]] '''Aita Donostia''' (Father [[Donostia]] or Father San Sebastian, because he was a priest born in [[San Sebastián|San Sebastian]], Donostia in the [[Basque language]]), was a [[Basque music]]ologist and composer.&lt;ref&gt;[[New Grove]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known as '''José Antonio de Donostia.'''&lt;ref&gt;Obras musicales del Padre Donostia: Piano José Antonio de Donostia, Jorge de Riezu - 1972 -&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1936 to 1943 he was in exile in France.
 
His most popular work is the ''Basque Preludes'', a set of fifteen piano pieces inspired by Basque traditional music, arranged in a very romantic way, that reminds Robert Schumann's and Edvard Grieg's styles.

'''Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani''' ({{lang-fa|اکبر هاشمی رفسنجانی|Akbar Hāshemī Rafsanjānī}} {{Audio|Fa-ir-hashemi.ogg|pronunciation}} or '''Hashemi Bahramani''', often mistakenly known as ''Ali Akbar'' Hashemi Rafsanjani &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/world/middleeast/ayatollah-rafsanjani-dead.html?_r=0 |title=Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Ex-President of Iran, Dies at 82 |website=nytimes.com |date=2017-01-08 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;; 25 August 1934 – 8 January 2017) was an influential [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] politician, writer and one of the founding fathers of the [[Islamic Republic]] who was the fourth [[President of Iran]] from 3 August 1989 until 3 August 1997. He was the head of the [[Assembly of Experts]] from 2007 until 2011, when he decided not to nominate himself for the post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/story/214628.html In Rafsanjani’s election to key post, Iran moderates see victory] Indian Express, 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/iran_rafsanjani_assembly_of_experts/2331272.html Iran's Rafsanjani Loses Key Post On Assembly Of Experts] Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 8 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the chairman of the [[Expediency Discernment Council]].

During the final years of the [[Iran–Iraq War]], Rafsanjani was the ''de facto'' commander-in-chief of the Iranian military. He was elected chairman of the [[Iranian parliament]] in 1980, serving until 1989. He played an important role in the choice of [[Ali Khamenei]] as Supreme Leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/16/iran-election-rafsanjani-defends-decision-stand|title=Iran election: Rafsanjani defends decision to stand as his 'national duty'|author=Ian Black|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rafsanjani became president of Iran after winning the [[Iranian presidential election, 1989|1989 election]]. He served another term by winning the election in [[Iranian presidential election, 1993|1993]]. In the [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|2005 election]] he ran for a third term in office, placing first in the first round of elections but ultimately losing to rival [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in the run-off. He and his family faced political isolation for their support of the opposition [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests|in 2009]].

He left at the age of 14 to study theology in [[Qom]]. There he became acquainted with the ideas of Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], the most senior dissident cleric who later became the founder of the [[Islamic Republic]], on the political rule of the clergy. He studied theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22494982|title=Profile: Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other teachers were [[Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi]], [[Mohammad-Reza Golpaygani]], [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]], [[Abdul-Karim Ha'eri Yazdi]], [[Shahab al-Din Mar'ashi Najafi]], [[Nematollah Salehi Najafabadi]], [[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i]], and [[Hussein-Ali Montazeri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hamshahrionline.ir/news-32244.aspx|title=زندگینامه اکبرهاشمی رفسنجانی|date=9 January 2017|access-date=10 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614142241/http://hamshahrionline.ir/news-32244.aspx|archive-date=14 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==

=== Pre-Revolution struggles ===
When he was studying at [[Qom Seminary]], he became interested in politics under [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]. He was one of the opposition of [[Mohammad Reza Shah]]'s [[White Revolution]] and accompanied with Khomeini. With Khomeini's exile, Hashemi's role in the fight against the Shah and representing Khomeini in the country was highlighted. This opposition eventually led to his arrest and imprisonment. He was arrested for 7 times from 1960 until 1979 and was in jail for four years and 5 months in total due to his clandestine activities against Pahlavi regime. Despite the anti-Western attitude of revolutionaries, he had traveled to 20 states of the [[United States]]. Although individual major pre-revolutionary speeches against Shah regime, But Khomeini acted him as financial manager of revolutionary struggle as well as connector with other revolutionary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/influential-former-iranian-president-hospitalized-162420955.html|title=Rafsanjani, Iran leader whose life mirrored nation's, dies|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the groups that had a deep bond with Hashemi, was the [[Islamic Coalition Party]], which is known as responsible for the assassination of former [[Prime Minister of Iran|Prime Minister]] [[Hassan Ali Mansur]]. This communication was another reason for his arrest. In prison, he found the opportunity to become familiar with other groups opposed to the Shah.

=== After the revolution ===
After the victory of [[Iranian Revolution]], Hashemi became one of the members of [[Council of Islamic Revolution]]. He was one of the powerful members of the council from its establishment. He was also deputy interior minister at that time and later became the acting interior minister.

He was one of the 28 founders of Traditional right-wing [[Combatant Clergy Association]] and also one of the members of the central committee of [[Islamic Republican Party]] at the first years of the revolution. Years later, it was him that requested IRP's dissolution. His political acumen and Khomeini's full trust helped Rafsanjani as one of the most powerful politicians in Iran at that time. At the time, he was the closest person to the Khomeini and ruled as his  "eyes and ears". According to the ''Gold'', [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] was established with the help of Hashemi.

At [[Iranian hostage crisis]] in 1980, Hashemi Rafsanjani mentioned it as "one of the largest manufacturer in the history". However, on the tenth anniversary of the revolution, he said in an interview that according to the experiences of these years, the hostage was "wrong".

Hashemi served as one of the [[List of Tehran's Friday Prayer Imams|Tehran's Friday Prayer Imams]] (for next thirty years), Representative of Khomeini at Defence High Council (after death of [[Mostafa Chamran]]) and Second-in-Command of Iran's Joint Chiefs of Staff in the last year of [[Iran–Iraq War]]. He forced Khomeini to accept to end the war. Only three months after his appointment as Iran's deputy commander-in-chief, Iran accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 598]] and eight-year war was ended.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-rafsanjani-death-idUSKBN14S0V9|title=Rafsanjani, dead at 82, was one of the titans of post-revolutionary Iran|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chairmanship of the Parliament ==
[[File:President Rajaei Inauguration at Majlis.jpg|thumb|left|Hashemi as parliament chairman in the inauguration of [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai]]]]
Iran's first [[Election Law]] was developed with Hashemi's partnership. He nominated as one of the [[Islamic Republican Party]]'s candidates in the [[Iranian legislative election, 1980|1980 legislative election]] in [[Tehran]]. He gained 1,151,514 (54%) votes and ranked 15. Rafsanjani was the Speaker of [[Parliament of Iran]] for 9 years. He was elected as the speaker in 1980 in the first season of Parliament after the [[Iranian Revolution]]. He was also chairman in the second season and first year of the third parliament. After the death of [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], founder of the [[Islamic Republic]] and election of then-President [[Ali Khamenei]] as new supreme leader, he joined the [[Iranian presidential election, 1989|1989 presidential race]] and became the [[President of Iran|President]], leaving Parliament.

He had a determining role in the dismissal of [[Abulhassan Banisadr]] as commander-in-chief of Iranian military and then his impeachment in the parliament as Iran's first president in June 1981. In the summer of 1981, he protested to the veto of the parliament's plan by the [[Guardian Council]] and informed it to Ruhollah Khomeini. This led to the establishment of [[Expediency Discernment Council]], which later he chaired the council. He had an active role in [[Iran–Contra affair]], which was divulged by [[Mehdi Hashemi]] and failed. Mehdi Hashemi was executed but Rafsanjani was the loser at internal dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/akbar-hashemi-rafsanjani-influential-former-iranian-president-dies-age-82/|title=Influential former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani dies age 82|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KhatamiRafsanjani.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Rafsanjani as the chairman of the parliament with future President [[Mohammad Khatami]]]]
In [[Iranian presidential election, October 1981|October 1981 presidential election]], when he voted to [[Ali Khamenei]], he said it's vote of "Imam (Khomeini), clerics and the parliament". During differences between Prime Minister [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]] and Khamenei, Hashemi cleverly managed to keep the position favor or against these two perspectives and take the middle position. According to Bahman Bakhtiari, at that time Mousavi was the leader of the [[Iranian reform movement|left-wing]], and Khamenei the [[Iranian Principlists|right-wing]]. With the death of Khomeini (one of the supporters of leftists), leftists were weakened. In such circumstances, Hashemi leaped for a powerful presidency.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-08/hashemi-rafsanjani-former-iranian-president-dies-at-age-82|title=Rouhani Loses Key Ally as Former Iran Leader Rafsanjani Dies|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presidency ==
[[File:Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani 02.jpg|thumb|left|Rafsanjani with newly elected Supreme Leader, [[Ali Khamenei]], 1989]]
Rafsanjani adopted an "economy-first" policy, supporting a privatization policy against more state-owned economic tendencies in the Islamic Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Pasri, Trita, ''Treacherous Alliance: The Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran and the United States'', Yale University Press, 2007, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; Another source describes his administration as "[[economic liberalism|economically liberal]], politically [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]], and philosophically traditional" which put him in confrontation with more radical deputies in the majority in the [[Majles of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.153&lt;/ref&gt;

As president, Rafsanjani was credited with spurring Iran's reconstruction following the 1980–88 [[Iran–Iraq War|war with Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/rafsanjani.htm|title=Hojjatoleslam Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|publisher=Globalsecurity.org|date=|accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reforms, despite attempting to curb the powers of the ultra-conservatives, failed to do so, and the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guards]] received increasing power from Khamenei during his presidency.

=== Domestic policy ===
Rafsanjani advocated a free market economy. With the state's coffers full, Rafsanjani pursued an economic liberalization policy.&lt;ref name="r" /&gt; Rafsanjani's support for a deal with the United States over Iran's nuclear program and his free-market economic policies contrasted with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his allies, who advocate maintaining a hard line against Western intervention in the Middle East while pursuing a policy of economic redistribution to Iran's poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,,1804628,00.html|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Voice of ambition|date=23 June 2006|accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By espousing World Bank inspired structural adjustment policies, Rafsanjani desired a modern industrial-based economy integrated into the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;Book: Factional politics in post-Khomeini Iran By Mehdi Moslem&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Some Iranian commanders of Iran-Iraq War.jpg|thumb|Hashemi with some Iranian commanders of [[Iran–Iraq War]]]]
During his presidency, a period in which Rafsanjani is described by western media sources as having been the most powerful figure in Iran, people ordered executed by the [[judicial system of Iran]] included political dissidents, drug offenders, Communists, Kurds, Bahais, and even Islamic clerics.&lt;ref name="critic" /&gt;

The Iranian [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|Mojahedin]] were recognized as a terrorist organization by both the Iranian government as well as the United States CIA. Regarding the Mojahedin, Rafsanjani said (''Ettela'at'', 31 October 1981):

{{quote|God's law prescribes four punishments for them (the Mojahedin). 1-Kill them. 2-Hang them, 3-Cut off their hands and feet 4-Banish them. If we had killed two hundred of them right after the Revolution, their numbers would not have mounted this way. I repeat that according to the Quran, we are determined to destroy all [Mojahedin] who display enmity against Islam.}}

Rafsanjani also worked with Khamenei to maintain the stability of government after the death of Khomeini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Menashri|title=post revolutionary politics In iran|page=62|year=2001|publisher=Frank Cass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign policy ===
[[File:Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Kofi Annan in Tehran.jpg|thumb|left|Hashemi meeting with former [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]]]]
Following years of deterioration in foreign relations under Khomeini during the Iran–Iraq War, Rafsanjani sought to rebuild ties with Arab states&lt;ref&gt;Mafinezam, Alidad and Aria Mehrabi, ''Iran and its Place Among Nations'', Greenwood, 2008, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with countries in [[Central Asia]] and the Caucasus, including [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohaddessin, Mohammad, ''Islamic Fundamentalism'', Anmol, 2003, pp.70–72&lt;/ref&gt; However, relations with European countries and the United States remained poor, even though Rafsanjani had a track record of handling difficult situations and defusing crises.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/748/re1.htm Al-Ahram Weekly|Region|Showdown in Tehran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112173351/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/748/re1.htm |date=12 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He condemned both the [[United States]] and [[Iraq]] during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] in 1991. After the war he strove to renew close ties with the West, although he refused to lift [[Khomeini]]'s fatwa against the British author [[Salman Rushdie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9450584 Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani Biography – Biography.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rafsanjani said that Iran is ready to assist Iraq, "expecting nothing in return", he also said that "peace and stability" is a function of the "evacuation of the occupiers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-24/0612281096010001.htm Iran ready for comprehensive assistance to the Iraqi nation – Rafsanjani – Irna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114004735/http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-24/0612281096010001.htm |date=14 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran gave humanitarian help to the victims of the conflict. Iran sent truckloads of food and medicine to Iraq, and thousands of Kuwaiti refugees were given shelter in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;''Iran's Persian Gulf Policy: From Khomeini to Khatami'', by Christin Marschall&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2016}}

Rafsanjani voiced support to Prince Abdullah's peace initiative and to "everything the Palestinians agree to". He also stated that what he called "Iran's international interests" must take precedence over those of Iranian allies in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Ayatollah Rafsanjani is a supporter of Iran's nuclear program. In 2007 Rafsanjani reiterated that the use of weapons of mass destruction was not part of the Islamic Republic culture. Rafsanjani said: "You [US and allies] are saying that you cannot trust Iran would not use its nuclear achievements in the military industries, but we are ready to give you full assurances in this respect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2007/iran-070223-irna03.htm|title=Rafsanjani reassures West Iran not after A-bomb|author=John Pike|publisher=globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Economist]]'', he is regarded by many Iranians "as the only person with the guile and clout to strike a deal with the West to end economic sanctions" imposed upon the country due to its nuclear program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21578110-two-last-ditch-presidential-contenders-may-rattle-ruling-clerics-candidacy|title=A candidacy conundrum|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== After presidency ==
[[File:IRAN election.jpg|thumb|left|Hashemi supporters in the [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|2005 election]]]]
Post-presidency, Rafsanjani delivered a sermon at [[Tehran University]] in the summer of 1999 praising government use of force to suppress student demonstrations.&lt;ref name="critic"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sciolino|first=Elaine|date=19 July 2009|title=Iranian Critic Quotes Khomeini Principles|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/world/middleeast/19assess.html?_r=1&amp;hp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, in the first election after the end of his presidency, Rafsanjani ran again for Parliament. In the [[Tehran]] contest, Rafsanjani came in 30th, or last, place. At first, he was not among the 30 representatives of Tehran elected, as announced by the [[Iranian Ministry of the Interior]], but the [[Council of Guardians]] then ruled numerous ballots void, leading to accusations of ballot fraud in Rafsanjani's favor.&lt;ref name="critic" /&gt;

[[File:Golpaygani-Rafsanjani-Ahmadinejad.jpg|thumb|Rafsanjani in [[Eid al-Fitr]] prayer, while [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] is sitting at his side]]

Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani was chairman of the [[Assembly of Experts]], which is responsible for appointing or removing the Supreme Leader, who has been rumored to not be in the best of health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Iran_Sources_Dismiss_Buzz_Over_Khamenei_Health/1852718.html Iran Sources Dismiss Buzz Over Khamenei Health] RFEFL, 15 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After the disputed results of the election were certified by the Supreme Leader, Rafsanjani was reported to have called a meeting of the Assembly of Experts, but it is unknown what the outcome or disposition of this meeting actually was.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/14/iran-ahmadinejad-mousavi-elections-result World leaders urged by Iran's opposition party to reject Ahmadinejad's alleged victory] Julian Borger and Ian Black, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Rafsanjani relocated from Tehran to [[Qom]], where the country's religious leaders sit. However, for the most part, Rafsanjani was silent about the controversial 12 June election and its aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Iran/idUSTRE55P3WI20090626|publisher=Reuters|title=Rafsanjani's future at stake in Iran turmoil|date=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikinews|Former Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani leads Friday prayers}}
On 17 July 2009, Rafsanjani publicly addressed the election crisis, mass arrests and the issue of freedom of expression during [[Friday prayers]]. The prayers witnessed an extremely large crowd that resembled the Friday prayers early after the revolution. Supporters of both reformist and conservative parties took part in the event. During prayers, Rafsanjani argued the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobile.chicagotribune.com/inf/infomo?view=nationworld_article&amp;feed:a=chi_trib_5min&amp;feed:c=nationworld&amp;feed:i=48120341&amp;nopaging=1 "Rafsanjani backs tolerance, dialogue"] ''Los Angeles Times'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

We should let our media write within the framework of the law and we should not impose restrictions on them. ... We should let our media even criticize us. Our security forces, our police and other organs have to guarantee such a climate for criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iran-prayers17-2009jul17,0,2003066.story|work=The Los Angeles Times|title=In Iran, tensions build ahead of Rafsanjani's Friday sermon|first1=Borzou|last1=Daragahi|first2=Ramin|last2=Mostaghim|date=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His support for the [[Iranian Green Movement|Green Movement]] reinvigorated his image among the urban middle-class segments of Iranian society who made up the bulk of the movement and solidified Rafsanjani's role as a backer of factions within Iran that advocated the reform of the system to ensure its survival.

=== Assembly of Experts election ===
On 8 March 2011 Rafsanjani lost his post as chairman of the powerful [[Assembly of Experts]], replaced by Ayatollah [[Mohammad-Reza Mahdavi Kani]]. Rafsanjani stated that he withdrew from the election for chairman to "avoid division." The loss was said to be the result of intensive lobbying "in recent weeks" by "hardliners and supporters" of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], and part of Rafsanjani's gradual loss of power over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2057794,00.html Iran: Ex-Leader Rafsanjani Loses Role] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311144422/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2057794,00.html |date=11 March 2011 }}, by AP / Ali Akbar Dareini, 8 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013 presidential elections ===

[[File:Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani announcing his candidacy in 2013 election.jpg|thumb|Hashemi announcing his candidacy with his daughter, Fatemeh accompanied him.]]

=== Later years ===
Reformers had enjoyed his support in recent years, helping to tilt the balance of power towards more moderate forces who managed to win the presidential poll in 2013 with the victory of [[Hassan Rouhani]] and parliamentary elections in [[Iranian legislative election, 2016|2016]].

Rafsanjani could not act as a political horse trader—for example, he could not prevent reformist candidates from being disqualified—but his role in guiding reformist politicians was a crucial one and, up to a point, he was able to influence Khamenei by preventing him from making one-sided decisions. Hardliners now have a chance to completely surround the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] and block moderate influences. Rafsanjani played politics the way it was played during the time of Ayatollah Khomeini—or at least, that is what he wanted you to believe—but with his death the so-called "Imam's Line," key figures from the beginning of the [[Iranian Revolution|Revolution]], who were close to [[Khomeini]]—is near its end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/08/how-akbar-hashemi-rafsanjani-s-death-will-empower-the-ayatollah.html|title=How Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's Death Will Empower the Ayatollah|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also kept his traditional connections with the clergy in the holy city of [[Qom]] and with conservative forces within the political establishment, which made it difficult for hardliners to form a strong front against moderate forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/44b5fcda-d5ed-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e|title=Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iranian politician, 1934–2017|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning reelection to his seat at [[Assembly of Experts]] as Tehran district's first person, Rafsanjani announced that it was the last time that he joined an election as a candidate and will be retired from politics at the end of the current term. He also said "Now I can die with peace of mind" after seeing election of a moderate parliament in the [[Iranian legislative election, 2016|2016 legislative election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/01/iran-reformists-stand-lose-rafsanjani-death-170109100325733.html|title=Iran's reformists stand to lose from Rafsanjani's death|date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rafsanjani died on 8 January 2017, at 19:30 ([[UTC+03:30]]) following a [[heart attack]] in [[Tajrish]]'s ''Shohada-ye Tajrish'' Hospital in north Tehran, as reported by Iranian state-run media.&lt;ref&gt;Torbat, Akbar (2017), The Legacy Of Iran's Powerful Cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-38547027 |publisher=BBC Persian Service |script-title=fa:اکبر هاشمی رفسنجانی درگذشت}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY-death"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erdbrink|first1=Thomas|title=Death of Iran's Rafsanjani Removes Influential Voice Against Hard-Liners|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/world/middleeast/iran-ali-akbar-hashemi-rafsanjani-dies.html?_r=0|accessdate=8 January 2017|work=The New York Times|date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 82 years old at the time of his death. The government announced three days of [[National day of mourning|national mourning]] and a public holiday on his funeral day. Black banners were raised in Tehran and other cities and some posters showed the Supreme Leader and Rafsanjani together smiling. Five days of mourning also observed in the southern province of [[Kerman]], where Ayatollah Rafsanjani's hometown of [[Rafsanjan]] is located.

Two months after his death, a street in [[Tehran]]'s [[Sa'adat Abad]] was renamed in his honour. Many streets in other cities also named Hashemi Rafsanjani. The central building of [[Azad University]] also named as Hashemi Building and a statue of him was installed outside of the building. Kerman International Airport was also renamed to [[Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani Airport]].

== Controversies ==

=== Accusations ===
[[File:Mykonos restaurant plaque.jpg|thumb|The names of the victims appear in the commemorative plaque in front of Mykonos restaurant in [[Berlin]]]]

Rafsanjani was sought by the Argentinian government for ordering the [[1994 AMIA bombing]] in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/world/middleeast/ayatollah-rafsanjani-dead.html Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Ex-President of Iran, Dies at 82]&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the allegation that senior Iranian officials planned the attack in an August 1993 meeting, including Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, [[Mohammad Hejazi]], Khamenei's intelligence and security advisor, Rafsanjani, then president, [[Ali Fallahian]], then intelligence minister, and [[Ali Akbar Velayati]], then foreign minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barsky|first=Yehudit|title=Hizballah|url=http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/Hizballah_052003.pdf|work=The American Jewish Committee|accessdate=5 August 2013|format=Terrorism Briefing|date=May 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184824/http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/Hizballah_052003.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 during the [[Mykonos restaurant assassinations|Mykonos trial]] in Germany, it was declared that Rafsanjani, the then president of Iran, alongside Ayatollah Khamenei, Velayati and Fallahian had a role in the assassination of Iran's opposition activists in Europe.

=== Tension with Ahmadinejad ===
After his loss at the presidential elections in 2005, a growing tension between him and President Ahmadinejad arose. Rafsanjani has criticized Ahmadinejad's administration several times for conducting a purge of government officials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4443856.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Rafsanjani slams Iran president|date=17 November 2005|accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; slow move towards [[Privatization in Iran|privatization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6290101.stm|work=BBC News|title=Criticism of Ahmadinejad mounts|date=23 January 2007|accessdate=23 April 2010|first=Frances|last=Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recently hostile foreign policy in particular the atomic energy policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/11/rafsanjani_ahmadinejad_engage.html Rafsanjani, Ahmadinejad Engage in New War of Words (ROOZ: English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116061350/http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/11/rafsanjani_ahmadinejad_engage.html |date=16 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In return Ahmadinejad fought back that Rafsanjani failed to differentiate privatization with the corrupt takeover of government-owned companies and of foreign policies which led to [[sanctions against Iran]] in 1995 and 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rajanews.com/News/?6881 حمله به دولت در اولين كنفرانس خبري پس از 9 سال Raja News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308092523/http://www.rajanews.com/News/?6881 |date=8 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rajanews.com/News/?5081 نمی‌پذیریم عده ای حرف خود را به نام سند چشم انداز مطرح کنند Raja News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129055653/http://www.rajanews.com/News/?5081 |date=29 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also implicitly denounced Rafsanjani and his followers by calling those who criticize his nuclear program as "traitors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7090901.stm|work=BBC News|title=Iran president attacks 'traitors'|date=12 November 2007|accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a debate with [[Mir-Hossein Moussavi]] in [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]], Ahmadinejad accused Hashemi of corruption. Hashemi released an open letter in which he complained about what he called the president's "insults, lies and false allegations" and asked the country's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/world/middleeast/11iran.html?ref=aliakbarhashemirafsanjani&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|first=Robert F. |last=Worth|title=In Iran Race, Ex-Leader Works to Oust President|date=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tension with Khamenei ===
In his latter years, Rafsanjani had disagreements with [[Ali Khamenei]] who has the last say in everything in [[Iran]]. Khamenei even indirectly called Rafsanjani a traitor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/03/khamenei-rafsanjani-treason-mohammadi-tweet-missiles.html&lt;/ref&gt; Khamenei acknowledged that he and Rafsanjani had differences after Rafsanjani's death,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2017/01/08/505384/Iran-Leader-Ayatollah-Seyyed-Ali-Khamenei-Expediency-Council-Ayatollah-Akbar-Hashemi-Rafsanjani&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to Rafsanjani as [[Hujjat al-Islam]] (lower clerical rank than [[Ayatollah]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://eaworldview.com/2017/01/iran-daily-regime-buries-former-president-rafsanjani/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=khamenei_ir|author=Khamenei.ir|number=818193262469120001|date=8 January 2017|title=Sorrowfully I received news of sudden demise of my old friend esteemed Hojjat al-Islam wal-Moslemin Sheikh Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.mehrnews.com/news/122580/Leader-pays-tribute-to-old-friend-Hashemi-Rafsanjani&lt;/ref&gt; even though in reality Rafsanjani was of higher clerical rank, as Rafsanjani was an [[Ayatollah]].

According to him, the problem of having political party undertook by common sense and people. In other word [[Islam]] has not definite opinion on parties. [[Islam]] placed the duty of having party on the shoulders of peoples themselves. Islam has not any disagreement with partition.

=== Political parties ===
Before Iranian Revolution, Rafsanjani was active in the anti-Shah activities and reportedly associated with the [[Motalefeh|Islamic Coalition]]'s ''shura-ye ruhaniyat'' ({{literal translation|Council of the
Clergy}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Buchta|first1=Wilfried|title= Who rules Iran?: the structure of power in the Islamic Republic|publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, The Konrad Adenauer Stiftung| place=Washington DC|year=2000|isbn=0-944029-39-6|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|People's Mujahedin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Thomas M.|title=Encyclopedia of the Developing World|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-415-97663-4|page=1343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was regarded as flip-flopping between conservative and reformist camps since the election of [[Mohammad Khatami]], supporting reformers in that election, but going back to the conservative camp in the [[Iranian parliamentary elections, 2000|2000 parliamentary elections]] as a result of the reformist party severely criticizing and refusing to accept him as their candidate. Reformists, including [[Akbar Ganji]], accused him of involvement in murdering dissidents and writers during his presidency. In the end, the major differences between the Kargozaran and the reformists party weakened both and eventually resulted in their loss at [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|the presidential elections in 2005]]. However, Rafsanjani regained close ties with the reformers since he lost the 2005 presidential elections to [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].&lt;ref name="r"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2006/10/061003_mv-az-rafsanjani-ahmadinejad.shtml Rafsanjani's political life reviewed] — in Persian.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Islamic Republican Party ====
{{Main|Islamic Republican Party}}
Hashemi refers to the point that the [[Islamic Republican Party]] established in the early years of revolution in Iran. [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], at first step, was disagree with establishment of Party because he known the establishment of party as something gradually. But After consultation of Hashemi with Khomeini, the opinion of Khomeini has changed. There were many negotiations and consultations on the instructions of Party .somebodies like [[Yadollah Sahabi]] and [[Habibollah Peyman]] were to communicate but after a while there were no communication with them. Although [[Mortaza Motahhari]] had not any disagreement to establishing party but at the same time he hadn't any communication with party. In fact, the idea of establishment of republic party was necessary in order to give the Mullahs an organization and political collection. The party has established formally on 17 February 1979, namely two weeks after the victory of [[Islamic Revolution]]. The members of the party even determined their members in Kanoon Touhid in early days. The financial expenses of party originated from the voluntary aids of people. At first, religious scholars or clerics took part in the party. In early days there were no financial problem but after a while the problem appeared. Khomeini tried to give financial aid to the party with giving money. The members primarily chose from revolutionary individuals and believed persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/349400/%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D9%88-%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%86%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%A2%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-(%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%B5%DB%8C-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%88?q=%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C%20%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%A8%D8%B1%20%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%85%DB%8C%20%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C&amp;score=1241.0408&amp;rownumber=10|title=polotical party from Ayatollah Rafsanjani|year=2000|pages=275–286|magazine=methodology of oral history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assets ===
The Rafsanjani family took their name from his great grandfather, whose last name was Hashem. When Akbar Hashemi was born, his father was a rich businessman with a valuable pistachio business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/04/the-middle-road-of-hashemi-rafsanjani.html |title=The Middle Road of Hashemi Rafsanjani |website=pbs.org |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assassination attempts ===
[[File:Hashemi Rafsanjani after assassination attempt.jpg|thumb|Rafsanjani speaking with the media after the first assassination attempt]]
Only months after the revolution, Rafsanjani was shot once in the stomach by gunmen&lt;ref&gt;''Hardline Ayatollah Shot in Tehran''. Andrew Whitley. The Financial Times (London, England), Saturday, May 26, 1979; pg. 2; Edition 27,874.&lt;/ref&gt; from one of the groups vying for power amid the political turmoil. He was not seriously wounded—and neither was his wife, who jumped in front to shield him from the attack. "Great men of history do not die," [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]] said in announcing that Rafsanjani had survived.

== Analysis ==
Although he was a close follower of Ayatollah Khomeini and considered as a central elite during Islamic revolution, at the same time he was fan of reconstruction of shattered country after war and according to this fact, he selected his cabinets from western-educated technocrats and social reformers. His cabinet largely was a reformist one. Rafsanjani acquired both the support of Imam Khomeini in one hand and Majlis in other hand. In fact, he tried to transfer the economy towards the free-market system. There was a gap among Rafsanjani and Khatami and reform agenda because of his partnership with those who were conservative. The first face of reformist movements began by Rafsanjani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anoushiravan Enteshami &amp; Mahjoob Zweiri|title=Iran and the rise of Neoconservatives, the politics of Tehran's silent Revolution|year=2007|pages=4–5|publisher=I.B.Tauris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amadou Hampâté Bâ''' (1900/1901 &amp;ndash; 15 May 1991) was a [[Mali]]an writer and [[ethnology|ethnologist]].

==Biography==
[https://www.webpulaaku.net/defte/ahb/index.html Amadou Hampâté Bâ] was born to an aristocratic [[Fula people|Fula]] family in [[Bandiagara]], the largest city in [[Dogon people|Dogon]] territory and the capital of the precolonial [[Masina Empire]]. At the time of his birth, the area was known as [[French Sudan]] as part of colonial [[French West Africa]], which was formally established a few years before his birth. After his father's death, he was adopted by his mother's second husband, Tidjani Amadou Ali Thiam of the [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] ethnic group. He first attended the [[Qur'an]]ic school run by [https://www.webpulaaku.net/defte/cerno_bokar_salif/index.html Tierno Bokar], a dignitary of the [[Tijaniyyah]] brotherhood, then transferred to a [[France|French]] school at Bandiagara, then to one at [[Djenné]]. In 1915, he ran away from school and rejoined his mother at [[Kati]], where he resumed his studies.

In 1921, he turned down entry into the ''école normale'' in [[Gorée]]. As a punishment, the governor appointed him to [[Ouagadougou]] with the role he later described as that of "an essentially precarious and revocable temporary writer". From 1922 to 1932, he held several posts in the colonial administration in [[French Upper Volta|Upper Volta]], now [[Burkina Faso]], and from 1932 to 1942 in [[Bamako]]. In 1933, he took six months' leave to visit [[Tierno Bokar]], his spiritual leader. (See also:[[Sufi studies]])

In 1942, he was appointed to the [[Institut Français d’Afrique Noire]] (IFAN — the French Institute of Black Africa) in [[Dakar]], thanks to the benevolence of [[Théodore Monod]], its director. At IFAN, he made [[ethnology|ethnological]] surveys and collected traditions. For 15 years he devoted himself to research, which would later lead to the publication of his work ''L'Empire peul de Macina'' (''The Fula Empire of Macina''). In 1951, he obtained a [[UNESCO]] grant, enabling him to travel to [[Paris]] and meet with intellectuals from Africanist circles, notably [[Marcel Griaule]].

With Mali's independence in 1960, Bâ founded the Institute of Human Sciences in Bamako, and represented his country at the [[UNESCO]] general conferences. In 1962, he was elected to UNESCO's executive council, and in 1966 he helped establish a unified system for the transcription of African languages.

His term in the executive council ended in 1970, and he devoted the remaining years of his life to research and writing. In 1971, he moved to the [[Marcory]] suburb of [[Abidjan]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hawkins | first =Peter | title =Amadou Hampaté Ba | work =French Literature Companion | publisher =Answers.com | url =http://www.answers.com/topic/amadou-hampate-ba | accessdate =2009-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked on classifying the archives of West African oral tradition that he had accumulated throughout his lifetime, as well as writing his memoirs (''Amkoullel l'enfant peul'' and ''Oui mon commandant!'', both published posthumously).  He died in Abidjan in 1991.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1580">'''Andy Hartley Payne''' (November 17, 1907 – December 3, 1977) was the winner of the International Trans-Continental Footrace in 1928. He ran the {{cvt|3423.5|mi}} route from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]], much of it along [[U.S. Route 66]], in 573 hours, 4 minutes, 34 seconds, (23 days) averaging {{convert|6|mph}} over an 84-day staged run.

Payne, a member of the [[Cherokee]] tribe, grew up in [[Foyil, Oklahoma]] which was one of the check point towns along the route of the race. His father was a friend of [[Will Rogers]] and had worked on the ranch of the latter's family during his youth.

The footrace was organized to promote [[U.S. Route 66]] which had recently been built as a simple, well-paved route across the country, and dubbed "the main street of America". First prize was $25,000 which Payne used to pay off the mortgage on his father's farm.

Andy Payne was elected clerk to the supreme court in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and was reelected 5 times afterwards.  {PBS documentary on the Great American Race of 1928}

He died in December 1977 at the age of 70.

[[File:Brer Rabbit dream, 1881.jpg|thumb|200px|Br'er Rabbit's dream, from ''Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings: The Folk-Lore of the Old Plantation'', 1881]]

'''Br'er Rabbit''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɛər}} (Brother Rabbit), also spelled '''Bre'r Rabbit''' or '''Brer Rabbit''' or '''Bruh Rabbit''', is a central figure as [[Uncle Remus]] tells stories of the [[Southern United States]]. Br'er Rabbit is a [[trickster]] who succeeds by his [[wit]]s rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social [[mores]] as he sees fit. [[The Walt Disney Company]] later adapted this character for its 1946 [[animation|animated]] [[motion picture]] ''[[Song of the South]]''.

== Tar-Baby story ==
In one tale, [[Br'er Fox]] constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the [[Tar-Baby]] amiably, but receives no response. Br'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby's lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br'er Fox, don't fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' by [[Robert Roosevelt]]; years later [[Joel Chandler Harris]] included his version of the tale in his [[Uncle Remus]] stories.

== African origins ==
[[File:Smit.Lepus crawshayi.jpg|thumb|The [[African savanna hare]] (''Lepus microtis'') found all over [[sub-Saharan Africa]]: the original Br'er Rabbit.]]
The Br'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to [[trickster]] figures in Africa, particularly the [[African savanna hare|hare]] that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in [[West Africa|West]], [[Central Africa|Central]], and [[Southern Africa]]. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the [[Akan people|Akan tradition]]s of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider [[Anansi]], though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br'er Rabbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joseph A. |last=Opala |authorlink=Joseph Opala |date= |title=Gullah Customs and Traditions |url=http://www.yale.edu/glc/gullah/05.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517040916/http://www.yale.edu/glc/gullah/05.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-05-17 |work=The Gullah: Rice, Slavery, and the Sierra Leone-American Connection }}{{self-published inline|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anansistories.com/African_Ja_Charact.html|title=African_Ja_Charact|author=|date=|website=anansistories.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br'er Rabbit represented the [[slavery|enslaved]] Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the white slave owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Lawrence |title=Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Folk Thought from Slavery to Freedom |year=1977 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not always successful, the efforts of Br'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multidimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.&lt;ref name="Arnold 1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Albert |title=Monsters, Tricksters, and Sacred Cows: Animal Tales and American Identities |year=1996 |publisher=University of Virginia Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster's behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It's trouble that makes the monkey chew on [[hot pepper]]s." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewarticle.asp?id=1030 |title=Brer Rabbit and Ananse Stories from Africa (article) by Peter E Adotey Addo on AuthorsDen |publisher=Authorsden.com |accessdate=July 3, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.&lt;ref name="Smith 1989"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Alexander McCall |title=The Girl Who Married A Lion and Other Tales from Africa |year=1989 |publisher=Pantheon Books, NY |pages=185–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br'er Rabbit and ''Leuk'', a rabbit trickster in [[Senegalese]] folklore.&lt;ref name="Arnold 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=M'Baye |first=Babacar |title=The Trickster Comes West: Pan-African Influence in Early Black Diasporan Narratives |year=2009 |publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories of Br'er Rabbit were written down by [[Robert Roosevelt]], an uncle of US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the [[State of Georgia]], that "She knew all the 'Br'er Rabbit' stories, and I was brought up on them. One of my uncles, Robert Roosevelt, was much struck with them, and took them down from her dictation, publishing them in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', where they fell flat. This was a good many years before a genius arose who, in 'Uncle Remus', made the stories immortal."

These stories were popularized for the mainstream audience in the late 19th century by [[Joel Chandler Harris]] (1845–1908), who wrote down and published many such stories that had been passed down by oral tradition. Harris also attributed the birth name ''Riley'' to Br'er Rabbit. Harris heard these tales in Georgia. Very similar versions of the same stories were recorded independently at the same time by the folklorist [[Alcée Fortier]] in southern [[Louisiana]], where the Rabbit character was known as ''Compair Lapin'' in [[Louisiana Creole|Creole]]. [[Enid Blyton]], the English writer of children's fiction, retold the stories for children.

== Cherokee origins ==
Although [[Joel Chandler Harris]] collected materials for his famous series of books featuring the character Br'er Rabbit in the 1870s, the Br'er Rabbit cycle had been recorded earlier among the [[Cherokee]]s: The "[[tar baby]]" story was printed in an 1845 edition of the ''Cherokee Advocate'', the same year Joel Chandler Harris was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powersource.com/cocinc/featured/tales.htm |title=Cherokee Tales and Disney Films Explored |publisher=Powersource.com |date=June 15, 1996 |accessdate=July 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524063615/http://www.powersource.com/cocinc/featured/tales.htm |archivedate=May 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbit and Hare myths abound among Algonquin Indians in Eastern North America, particularly under the name [[Nanabozho]]. The Great Hare is generally worshipped among tribes in eastern Canada.

In "That the People Might Live: Native American Literatures and Native American Community" by Jace Weaver, the origins of Br'er Rabbit and other literature are discussed. To say that a story only originates from one culture and not another can only be true when a group of people exist in complete isolation from others. Although the Cherokee had lived in isolation from Europeans in the remote past, a substantial amount of interaction was to occur among North American tribes, Europeans, and those from the enslaved population during the 18th and 19th centuries. It is impossible to ascertain whether the Cherokee story independently predated the African American story.

In a Cherokee tale about the briar patch, "the fox and the wolf throw the trickster rabbit into a thicket from which the rabbit quickly escapes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1990|journal=Latin American Indian literatures journal|publisher=Dept. of Foreign Languages at Geneva College|volume=6|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a "melding of the Cherokee rabbit-trickster&amp;nbsp;... into the culture of African slaves."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=08SkJw26qoMC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=%22brer+rabbit%22+cherokee&amp;source=web&amp;ots=RMF5bsVquT&amp;sig=jAm12HBXucpKmOoPhka2WcphA3M#PPA3,M1 ''That the People Might Live: Native American Literatures and Native American Community''], p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brat Pack''' is a nickname given to a group of young actors who frequently appeared together in teen-oriented [[:Category:Coming-of-age films|coming-of-age films]] in the 1980s. First mentioned in a 1985 [[New York (magazine)|''New York'']] magazine article, it is now usually defined as the cast members of two specific films released in 1985—''[[The Breakfast Club]]'' and ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]''—although other actors are sometimes included. The "core" members are considered to be [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Andrew McCarthy]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Judd Nelson]], [[Molly Ringwald]], and [[Ally Sheedy]].

==Membership==
The term "Brat Pack", a play on the [[Rat Pack]] from the 1950s and 1960s, was first popularized in a 1985 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine cover story, which described a group of highly successful film stars in their early twenties.&lt;ref name="New York"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://nymag.com/movies/features/49902/ | last=Blum |first=David |authorlink=David Blum |date=June 10, 1985|title=Hollywood's Brat Pack |journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |volume= |issue= |pages=40–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Blum]] wrote the article after witnessing several young actors (Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, and Judd Nelson) being mobbed by groupies at Los Angeles' [[Hard Rock Cafe]].&lt;ref name="Mansour"&gt;Mansour, David. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hK0rPUF85loC&amp;printsec=frontcover From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century]'' (Andrews McMeel Publishing, 2005), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The group has been characterized by the partying of members such as [[Robert Downey Jr.]], Estevez, Lowe, and Nelson.&lt;ref name="Year of the brat"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pulver |first=Andrew |author2=Steven Paul Davies |date=December 15, 2000 |title=The year of the brat |journal=[[The Guardian]]|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,411528,00.html |accessdate= 2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, an appearance in one or both of the ensemble casts of [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]' ''The Breakfast Club'' and [[Joel Schumacher]]'s ''St. Elmo's Fire'' is often considered the prerequisite for being a core Brat Pack member.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fine |first=Marshall |title=Remember the Brat Pack?

Absent from most lists is [[Mare Winningham]], the only principal member of either cast who never starred in any other films with any other cast members.&lt;ref name="The Players"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bratpackconfidential.com/brat-pack.html |title=Brat Pack Confidential: The Players |publisher=Brat Pack Confidential|accessdate=2008-03-19 |last=Pulver |first=Andrew |author2=Davies, Steven Paul|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409133511/http://www.bratpackconfidential.com/brat-pack.html|archivedate=April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estevez was cited as the "unofficial president" of the Brat Pack.&lt;ref name="New York" /&gt; He and Demi Moore were once engaged. In 1999, McCarthy said he was never a member of the group: "The media made up this sort of tribe. I don't think I've seen any of these people since we finished ''St. Elmo's Fire''."&lt;ref name="People"&gt;Miller, Samantha and Jewel, Dan. [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20127981,00.html "Brat Race"]. ''People''. April 19, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial ''New York'' article covered a group of actors larger, or more inclusive, than the currently understood meaning of the term "Brat Pack". For example, most of the cast members of ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'' were mentioned, including [[Tom Cruise]], [[C. Thomas Howell]], [[Matt Dillon]], [[Patrick Swayze]], and [[Ralph Macchio]], none of whom starred in any other 1980s movies with any "core" Brat Packers, besides [[Patrick Swayze]].&lt;ref name="New York" /&gt; [[Charlie Sheen]] appears in several lists&amp;nbsp;– more for his family relationship to Brat Pack leader Emilio Estevez and his partying than for his collaborative film work with other members.&lt;ref name="The Players" /&gt;

[[James Spader]] and [[Robert Downey, Jr.]] have also been considered members, and performed alongside other Brat Packers: both of them with Andrew McCarthy in ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]'';&lt;ref name="Eighties" /&gt; Spader with McCarthy in ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'' and with McCarthy and Molly Ringwald in ''[[Pretty in Pink]]''; and Downey with Anthony Michael Hall (''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'' and ''[[Johnny Be Good]]''; and the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'') and with Molly Ringwald (''[[The Pick-up Artist (film)|The Pick-up Artist]]''). Other actors who have been linked with the group include [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Jon Cryer]], [[John Cusack]], [[Jami Gertz]], [[Mary Stuart Masterson]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], and [[Lea Thompson]].&lt;ref name="Mansour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brat Pack" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brat Pack Site" /&gt; In her autobiography, [[Melissa Gilbert]] connects herself with the Brat Pack, as her social life centered on Estevez and Lowe (both of whom she was engaged to). Through frequent collaborative work, the actor [[Harry Dean Stanton]], then in his late 50s, became a mentor for the group of young actors.&lt;ref name="Year of the brat" /&gt;

==Article==
David Blum's ''New York'' story, titled "Hollywood's Brat Pack", ran on June 10, 1985. It was originally supposed to be just about Emilio Estevez, but one night, Estevez invited Blum to hang out with him, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, and others at the Hard Rock Cafe. It was a typical night out for the group, who had gotten close while filming ''St. Elmo's Fire''. That night, Blum decided to change the article's focus to an entire group of young actors at the time. The ''St. Elmo's Fire'' crew members did not like Blum and sensed that he was jealous of the actors' success.&lt;ref&gt;Gora, Susannah (2010). ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried: The Brat Pack, John Hughes, And Their Impact on a Generation''. Three Rivers Press. pp. 106–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the piece ran, the actors all felt betrayed, especially Estevez. The article mentioned people in several films but focused on Estevez, Lowe, and Nelson, and portrayed those three negatively. The "Brat Pack" label, which the actors disliked, stuck for years afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://observer.com/1999/08/actor-andrew-mccarthy-is-bitter-about-brat-pack-past/|title=Actor Andrew McCarthy Is Bitter About Brat Pack Past|date=August 30, 1999|website=Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Reason-Judd-Nelson-Hated-Brat-Pack-Label-86667.html|title=The Reason Judd Nelson Hated The Brat Pack Label|date=October 6, 2015|website=Cinemablend.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the article ran, they had been regarded as talented individuals; after the article, all of them were grouped together and regarded as unprofessional. Interviewed for Susannah Gora's 2010 book ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried: The Brat Pack, John Hughes, And Their Impact on a Generation'', Blum admitted that he should not have written the article.&lt;ref&gt;Gora, Susannah (2010). ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried''. Three Rivers Press. pp. 117–128, 289–291, 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increased negative attention to them, the actors soon stopped socializing with one another. On the group's camaraderie, Ally Sheedy later said, "[The article] just destroyed it. I had felt truly a part of something, and that guy just blew it to pieces."&lt;ref&gt;Gora, Susannah (2010). ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried''. Three Rivers Press. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
During the late 1980s, several of the Brat Pack actors had their careers mildly derailed by problems relating to drugs, alcohol, and in Lowe's case, a sex tape.&lt;ref name="People"/&gt; According to Gora, "Many believe they could have gone on to more serious roles if not for that article. They were talented. But they had professional difficulties, personal difficulties after that."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Craig. [https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2010-02-08-bratpack08_ST_N.htm "John Hughes and the Brat Pack, revisited"]. ''usatoday.com''. February 16, 2010. Retrieved 2011-01-24.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 21st century, the term "Brat Pack" had lost its negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Gora, Susannah (2010). ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried''. Three Rivers Press. p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

The films themselves have been described as representative of "the socially apathetic, cynical, money-possessed and ideologically barren eighties generation."&lt;ref name="Eighties"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id299.htm |title=13.

They are considered "among the most influential pop cultural contributions of their time."&lt;ref&gt;Gora, Susannah. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XawD2yexM_kC&amp;printsec=frontcover You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried: The Brat Pack, John Hughes, and Their Impact on a Generation]'' (Random House, Inc., 2010), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' listed ''The Breakfast Club'' as the best high school movie ever made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20483133_20632183_21215570,00.html "50 Best High School Movies"]. ew.com.

'''Brian Cant''' (12 July 1933 – 19 June 2017) was an English [[actor]] of stage, television and film, [[television presenter]], voice artist and writer best known for his work in [[BBC]] television programmes for children from 1964 onward, most notably ''[[Play School (UK TV series)|Play School]]''.

==Early life and education==
Cant was born in [[Ipswich]] and educated at Northgate Grammar School for Boys, a state grammar school, since renamed [[Northgate High School, Ipswich|Northgate High School]].&lt;ref name="Brian Cant obituary " /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suffolksociety.org/moderator/uploads/SV%20121%20Spring.pdf|title=Suffolk View|work=The Suffolk Society|date=Spring 2013|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He trained with [[Ipswich Town F.C.]] youth team.&lt;ref name="Brian Cant obituary " /&gt; He worked as a printer before starting to act in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Brian Cant obituary " /&gt;

==Television and film==
Cant was performing in [[BBC Schools]] drama television programmes about the Romans for the corporation when he heard that auditions were being held for a new pre-school children's programme which was to be shown on the new [[BBC 2]] channel. This was ''[[Play School (UK TV series)|Play School]]''. At his audition he was asked by programme creator and the series' first producer [[Joy Whitby]] to get in a cardboard box and pretend to 'row out to sea'.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite web|author=Interviews by Sarah Williams |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/oct/15/how-we-made-play-school |title=How we made: Joy Whitby and Phyllida Law on Play School &amp;#124; Culture |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pretended to fish from his 'boat' and caught a [[wellington boot]] full of custard. He was cast as a presenter and first appeared on the third week in May 1964, and stayed with the programme for 21 of its 24-year run and becoming, according to Whitby, 'Mr Play School'.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; In an interview, he defended ''Play School'' and similar children's programmes as being designed to encourage children to try out the ideas presented.&lt;ref name="Brian Cant obituary " /&gt;

His involvement in ''Play School'' directly led to his work on three linked [[Gordon Murray (puppeteer)|Gordon Murray]] puppet series: ''[[Camberwick Green]]'' (1966), ''[[Trumpton]]'' (1967), and ''[[Chigley]]'' (1969).&lt;ref name="Brian Cant obituary "&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/20/brian-cant-obituary |title=Brian Cant obituary  |last=Jeffries |first=Stuart  |access-date=21 June 2017 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publication-date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he hosted or co-hosted the programmes ''[[Play Away]]'' (1971–84), and ''[[Bric-a-Brac]]'' (1980–82) for slightly older children.&lt;ref name="Brian Cant obituary " /&gt; From 1990 to 1999, Cant starred as Brian the farmer in the children's television puppet programme ''[[Dappledown Farm]]'', as well as providing the voice for one of the characters, Harry the Heron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.handsuppuppets.com/html/DappledownFarm.html |title=Dappledown Farm children's TV Series Puppetry information |publisher=Handsuppuppets.com |date= |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cant was also the storyteller of the UK version of ''[[Jay Jay the Jet Plane]]'', and the narrator for the popular Canadian children's show ''Bruno''.&lt;ref name="doyouremember"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.doyouremember.co.uk/memory/brian-cant |title=Brian Cant |website=Do You Remember?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cant also appeared in television series for adults. In the 1960s he appeared in two ''[[Doctor Who]]'' stories, in 1965 as Kert Gantry in ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/daleksmasterplan/detail.shtml#cast |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide – The Daleks' Master Plan – Details |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1968 as Tensa in ''[[The Dominators]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/dominators/detail.shtml#cast |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide – The Dominators – Details |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 he presented the BBC programme ''[[The Great Egg Race]]'',&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0146705 |title=The Great Egg Race |website= BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the guest presenters featured in the 1982 series of the game show ''[[It's a Knockout]]'' after [[Eddie Waring]] retired.&lt;ref name="It's A Knockout - The BBC Series."&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.its-a-knockout.tv/bbc.htm |title=It's A Knockout - The BBC Series. |website=It's A Knockout}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 Cant parodied his previous contributions as a narrator in 'The Organ Gang', a weekly segment in [[Lee and Herring]]'s ''[[This Morning with Richard Not Judy]]'', a BBC TV Sunday afternoon comedy show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thismorningwithrichardnotjudy/ |title=Comedy – This Morning With Richard Not Judy |publisher=BBC |date=4 October 2007 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made three appearances in the BBC1 daytime drama ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'', each time as a different character, the last in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0134454/|title=Brian Cant|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His film appearances were few but included brief roles in ''[[The Pleasure Girls]]'' (1965), ''[[The Sandwich Man (1966 film)|The Sandwich Man]]'' (1966), and ''[[A Feast at Midnight]]'' (1995), starring [[Christopher Lee]].&lt;ref name="heraldscotland"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15359486.Obituary___Brian_Cant__popular_children_s_broadcaster_and_the_voice_of_Trumpton/?ref=arc |title=Obituary - Brian Cant, popular children's broadcaster and the voice of Trumpton |access-date=22 June 2017 |work=HeraldScotland |publication-date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also the narrator of the UK dub of ''[[Jay  Jay the Jet Plane]]''.

In April 2007, Cant was named as the best-loved voice from UK children's television, in a poll of over 1,200 people for ''[[Underground Ernie]]'' magazine. Cant came ahead of ''[[Bagpuss]]'' and ''[[Ivor the Engine]]'' narrator [[Oliver Postgate]] in second place, with [[David Jason]] (''[[Danger Mouse (1981 TV series)|Danger Mouse]]'') polling third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6525593.stm |title=Cant 'best children's TV voice' |publisher=BBC News |date=5 April 2007 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 November 2010, he received the special award at the [[British Academy Children's Awards|Children's BAFTAs]] for his work in children's television.&lt;ref name="Beebafta"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11860702|title=Three Children's Baftas for Horrible Histories|date=29 November 2010|work=BBC News|publisher=BC|accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBafta"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11809226|title=Brian Cant to be honoured at children's Baftas|date=22 November 2010|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his acceptance speech he said, "When I was a child I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child.

'''Etterlene "Bunny" DeBarge''' (born March 15, 1955) is an [[Americans|American]] [[soul music|soul]] singer–songwriter, best known as the lone female sibling of the Motown [[DeBarge family|family group]] [[DeBarge]]. She is also best known as the lead vocalist behind the classic R&amp;B ballad, "[[A Dream (DeBarge song)|A Dream]]" from the group's ''[[In a Special Way]]'' album and is also the co-writer of the group's 1982 breakthrough hit, "[[I Like It (DeBarge song)|I Like It]]" and the number-one hit, "[[Time Will Reveal (song)|Time Will Reveal]]".

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Etterlene DeBarge was the eldest of ten children, born to [[Etterlene DeBarge|Etterlene (née) Abney]] and Robert DeBarge, Sr. While spending her initial childhood in [[Detroit]], her family moved to [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] when she was sixteen. Bunny would later recall years of [[child abuse|physical and sexual abuse]] at the hands of her father, stating that he had started [[molesting]] her when she was seven and this carried on until she was thirteen. Bunny also detailed troubles in public school where she and her brothers were constantly bullied and taunted by black schoolmates for their [[multiracial]] ethnicity.

Bunny found solace in music, singing in her uncle's church as a child. She and her brothers soon participated in several groups together in various times. In 1972, DeBarge dropped out of school and married her first husband, for whom she'd be the mother of two children (they later divorced). Since she wasn't into instruments like her brothers were, Bunny taught herself how to write songs and compose melodies, which later paid off as she got older.

===Music career===
In 1979, after a couple years watching her brothers [[Bobby DeBarge|Bobby]] and Tommy ride to musical stardom as members of the band [[Switch (band)|Switch]], Bunny teamed up with her three brothers [[Randy DeBarge|Randy]], [[Mark DeBarge|Mark]] and [[El DeBarge|El]] and became the DeBarges. They signed with [[Motown Records|Motown]] after their demo tape was passed off by Switch's Gregory Williams to Motown CEO [[Berry Gordy]], who was left impressed by the siblings and soon put the band on a salary.

Between 1979 and 1981, Bunny and her brothers worked behind the scenes mainly on the works of Switch, with Bunny in particular collaborating with her brother Bobby on songs such as "Hold On to My Love",&lt;ref name='Hold'&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Hold On |titlelink= |others=High Inergy|year=1980 |chapter= |url= |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |page= |pages= |type= |publisher=Gordy Records |id= |location=Hollywood, California |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Love Over and Over Again" and "My Friend in the Sky". In 1981, Bunny co-produced the DeBarges' [[The DeBarges|self-titled debut album]] and was featured on lead vocals alongside brother El on "Share My World" which they wrote. A year later, in 1982, the group brought along their teenage brother [[James DeBarge|James]], and shortened their name to just '''DeBarge'''. That year, they released their second album, ''[[All This Love (album)|All This Love]]'', with which the siblings found musical success, particularly with "[[I Like It (DeBarge song)|I Like It]]", for which Bunny wrote parts of the lyrics, alongside her brothers Randy and El.

The group followed up this success with their third album, ''[[In A Special Way]]'', in 1983. The album yielded another hit with Bunny as a lyricist, with the gospel-influenced "[[Time Will Reveal]]". The album also included several more highlights including two more Bunny-composed ballads, "[[Stay with Me (DeBarge song)|Stay with Me]]" and "[[A Dream (DeBarge song)|A Dream]]", the last song Bunny took lead vocals on. Like ''All This Love'' before it, ''In a Special Way'' went gold, paving the way for the group's biggest success in 1985 with the ''[[Rhythm of the Night (album)|Rhythm of the Night]]'' album, with the [[Rhythm of the Night (song)|title track]] becoming a top five crossover hit. However, the album marked the beginning of the end of Bunny's tenure with the group.

Pressured to go solo after numerous arguments with her brothers, Bunny followed brother El out of the group in 1986 and the following year, Bunny put out her debut album, ''[[In Love (Bunny DeBarge album)|In Love]]'', releasing one single, "Save the Best for Me". The album failed to deliver any hits or stay on the charts long and Bunny soon left the label. Besieged by a growing drug addiction that had started during her heyday with DeBarge, she quietly exited from the music business at the end of the 1980s and with the exception of projects involving gospel music, including an album featuring some of her brothers, herself and their mother, Bunny hasn't released any more solo work.

===Personal life===
Bunny DeBarge has been married twice. In several of DeBarge's albums, she is listed as Etterlene Jordan and is sometimes referred to as either Etterlene Jordan-Knight or Etterlene DeBarge Knight. Bunny is the mother of four children and a grandmother of fifteen and still lives in Michigan, having moved back to Grand Rapids after years living in California. Much like her brothers, Bunny DeBarge has dealt with drug issues, going back to her teen years, which started with [[marijuana]] and moving up to [[prescription medication]] during her heyday with DeBarge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p16916|label=Bunny DeBarge}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon escalated to usage of [[cocaine]].

Bunny entered rehab several times to kick her habit. In 2008, she broke her silence issuing her autobiography, ''The Kept Ones'', in which she talked about her father's abuse towards her and her siblings and her dealings with substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0974613665 The Kept Ones] on Amazon.com&lt;/ref&gt; That year she appeared on the debut episode of the [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]] series, ''[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]'', in which she talked about her childhood and her time with DeBarge, along with brothers Randy and James. The trio again appeared on TV three years later in September 2011, on the show ''[[Lifechangers]]'' alongside Bunny's daughter Janae. James entered the rehabilitation program but left a few hours later. Randy left a few days later. Bunny entered the rehabilitation program and completed her entire experience. After leaving the rehabilitation program in West Hollywood, California, Bunny has been touring and focusing on her new album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2011/09/debarge_family_featured_today.html |title=DeBarge family featured today on 'Dr. Drew's Lifechangers' |publisher=MLive.com |date=2011-09-21 |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Chemist===
As a chemist and a scientist, Mitchell's work covered a wide range of topics. He became a fellow of the [[Royal Institute of Chemistry]] in 1897 and of the [[Chemical Society]] in 1916.&lt;ref name=Cox1948/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMJ1948&gt;{{cite journal|title=C. A.

His reasoning was that copper would better be able to alert the drinker to an excess of poisonous sulphates in the water.&lt;ref&gt;Copper Water Pipes, Duluth News-Tribune (Duluth, Minnesota), Saturday, October 7, 1911, Volume: 43 Issue: 155 Page: 13&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he became editor of ''[[The Analyst (journal)|The Analyst]]'', a journal of the Chemical Society, and under 25 years of his editorship the journal expanded in scope and increased in reputation.&lt;ref name=Nature1945&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dr. C.

===Criminologist===
In 1911 he was head of the inspection bureau of [[Scotland Yard]].&lt;ref&gt;Expert Testimony, The Rock Island Daily Union (Rock Island, Illinois) October 16, 1911, page 6, accessed October 24, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7159618/expert_testimony_the_rock_island_daily/&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently served as an expert witness. In 1915, he gave testimony about the invisible ink used in the case of German spy, Anton Kuepferle.&lt;ref name="Times1915"&gt;Alleged Spy on Trial, The Times (London, England) May 19, 1915, page 22, column 4 accessed October 24, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7159685/alleged_spy_on_trial_the_times/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 he analyzed documents and seals of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and claimed to show that Mary was innocent of conspiracy to assassinate Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]]. He said that [[William Maitland of Lethington|William Maitland]], Mary's secretary, forged Mary's hand in the documents which led to Mary's execution.&lt;ref&gt;Recent Tests Show Mary, Queen of Scots, Innocent, Brown County Democrat (Nashville, Indiana) June 23, 1925, page 4, accessed October 24, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7159730//&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, he was an advocate of the use of [[fingerprints]] to determine identity, a method which he traced to [[Sir William Herschel, 2nd Baronet|Sir William Herschell]] in 1853, who saw the method used in to document an individuals identity in [[India]], where he was a commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;The Use of Finger Prints, The Age (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, December 14, 1929, page 5, accessed October 24, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7159796/the_use_of_finger_prints_the_age/&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that monkeys may be identified by fingerprints and that the same could be done with the markings on a cow's nose.&lt;ref&gt;Monkey's identified, Lincoln Evening Journal (Lincoln, Nebraska), November 22, 1929, page 13, accessed October 24, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7159753/monkeys_identified_lincoln_evening/&lt;/ref&gt;

He was hired by [[Ruth White (Bahá'í author)|Ruth White]] to analyze the ''[[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá]]''. White opposed parts of the will that suggested the establishment of a hierarchy in the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. His report concluded in agreement with White, that the document was a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Momen, Moojan. Studies in Honor of the Late Hasan M. Balyuzi. Vol. 5. Kalimát Press, 1988. p273-274&lt;/ref&gt; White placed Mitchell's signed report on the writing shown on the photographs of the document with the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] in 1930.{{clarify|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fglaysher.com/bahaicensorship/CAMitchell_Report.htm|title=Dr. C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7890">'''Casto Jurado Alejandrino''' (November 18, 1911&lt;ref name="Pomeroy"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Les huks: dans la forêt des Philippines |last=Pomeroy |first=Wiliam |publisher=François Maspéro |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|161}} - July 12, 2005) was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] peasant leader and commander of the [[Hukbalahap]]. He was the Hukbalahap's vice-commander, second only to its ''Supremo'', [[Luis Taruc]]. Alejandrino was one of the few supporters of the Hukbalahap that were also [[landlord]]s, coming from the Alejandrino family which included former revolutionary general [[Jose Alejandrino]].

==Biography==
Alejandrino was born on November 18, 1911 in [[Arayat, Pampanga]]. His family included [[Jose Alejandrino]], the former revolutionary general and Senator. In the 1930s, Alejandrino managed to inherit 68 hectares of land in Arayat with fourteen tenants. He also became an active spokesperson for the peasant group ''[[Aguman ding Maldang Talapagobra]]'' and the Socialist Party of the Philippines. In 1938, when the PSP merged with the ''Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas'', Alejandrino held a position in the party's central committee. During the 1940 elections, Alejandrino ran under the AMT-endorsed Popular Front ticket and won a seat as mayor of Arayat.&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Huk Rebellion: A Study of Peasant Revolt in the Philippines |last=Kerkvliet |first=Bejamin |publisher=University of California Press |year=1977 |location=Los Angeles, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}

During the [[Second World War]], members of the PKP along with peasant groups such as the AMT and the ''[[Kalipunang Pambansa ng Magbubukid sa Pilipinas]]'' convened in [[Cabiao, Nueva Ecija]] to discuss organization, strategy, and tactics. A Central Luzon Bureau was formed and Alejandrino was elected as second-in-command of its Military committee, under [[Luis Taruc]]. A month later on March 29, 1942, peasant guerrillas and members of the AMT and the KPMP met again in Cabiao to form the [[Hukbalahap]]. It was headed by Taruc, Alejandrino, who also served as its vice-commander, Felipa Culala, and Bernardo Poblete.&lt;ref name="Saulo"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/969406494 |title=Communism in the Philippines : an introduction |last=Saulo |first=Alfredo |date=2002 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press |isbn=9715504035 |edition=Enlarged |location=Manila, Philippines |oclc=969406494}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30–31}}

During this time, Alejandrino adopted multiple aliases, such as Guan Yek (GY), Torres, GI, and Tatang.&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=The People of the Philippine Islands v. Casto Alejandrino |vol=GR L-23465 |reporter=SCRA  |court=Phil. |date=October 31, 1979 |url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1979/oct1979/gr_l_23465_1979.html#rnt1 |accessdate=12/31/2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alejandrino participated in guerrilla activity at this time, commanding Reco 3 in addition to his duties as General HQ vice-commander. The Huks also set up "provisional governments" in its liberated areas, and Alejandrino was appointed the governor of Pampanga.&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

At the close of the Second World War, American officials began arresting members of the Hukbalahap on charges of sedition. Alejandrino was arrested along with other leaders on February 1945 in [[San Fernando, Pampanga]]. A CIC report stated that their arrest was "the only way to end Huk domination in the area". They were freed on September 1945.&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt;{{rp|112–113}} The Hukbalahap was officially disbanded and a Huk Veterans' League, with Alejandrino as its nominal chairman.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|35}} The purpose of the Veterans' League was to help get the Hukbalahap recognized as a legitimate guerrilla movement. During this time, the relationship between the American forces and the Hukbalahap deteriorated further, owing to its antagonistic relationship with the [[USAFFE]] guerrillas.&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt;{{rp|114–116}} Huk veterans were persecuted and charged with sedition and rebellion, and some veterans chose to not go down from the mountains. This lack of recognition, combined with peasant abuses by the landowning class, and the results of the 1946 elections, added to the growing unrest in Central Luzon. This led to former Huk veterans going back to the mountains, a situation described as a "spontaneous peasant revolution".&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt;{{rp|168}}

In June 1946, veterans of the Hukbalahap met in [[Candaba, Pampanga]] to form a contingency plan. The Central Luzon Command and the South Luzon Command were both established. Alejandrino was again elected vice-commander.&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt;{{rp|169}} Two months later, [[Juan Feleo]], a noted peasant activist, was taken and killed by armed men. As a result of this, the peasantry took to arms against the government in [[Hukbalahap rebellion|open rebellion]], reforming the Hukbalahap as the ''Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan''. Alejandrino would resume his guerrilla activities, commanding Reco 4 from 1949-1951.&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt;{{rp|213}}

On February 15, 1954, Alejandrino went into talks with the Magsaysay administration, which failed.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|53;181}} That April, he arrived in the Bulacan area of the Sierra Madre, carrying an order from the PKP secretariat to arrest Taruc on charges of deviating from the party line, leading to Taruc's surrender to the government.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|53}} Alejandrino continued the struggle for three more years. In 1957, Alejandrino met up with remnants of the HMB in Zambales and gradually implement the strategy of legal struggle, ending the armed rebellion of the Hukbalahap.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|181–182}}

On October 21, 1960, Alejandrino was arrested in Malabon on charges of violating RA 1700, known as the Anti-Subversion Law, and was imprisoned.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|55}} He died on July 12, 2005.

==Personal life==
Alejandrino was a member of the well-to-do Alejandrino family, who were landowners in Pampanga. Members include General [[Jose Alejandrino]], [[Pio Valenzuela]] (through Valenzuela's mother's side), Arayat mayor Bonifacio Emmanuel "Bon" Alejandrino, and president of the Hukvets foundation, Carlos Alejandrino. Bon and Carlos are both Casto's nephews.&lt;ref name="Inq"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/624758/neglected-huk-vets-seek-recognition |title=Neglected, Huk vets seek recognition |last=Orejas |first=Tonette |access-date=2017-12-31 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in the guerrilla movement, Alejandrino had a wife and children living in the barrio. He also had two "forest wives" while in the field, Teofista Valerio and Belen Bagul-Bagul. Valerio (alias "Estrella") was the head of Huk communications in Manila.&lt;ref name="Lanzona"/&gt;{{rp|5}} Valerio and Alejandrino were married in a Huk ceremony on May 26, 1948. Alejandrino and Valerio were separated on August 4, 1949, and would not meet until exactly twenty years later in 1970. They had one daughter.&lt;ref name="Lanzona"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/256765845 |title=Amazons of the Huk rebellion : gender, sex, and revolution in the Philippines |last=Lanzona |first=Vina |date=2009 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=9789715506236 |location=Madison, Wis. |oclc=256765845}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|197–201}} After Valerio's arrest and their separation, Alejandrino met Belen Bagul-Bagul.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2523">'''Charley R. Lockhart''' (August 1876 - 1954) was Texas State Treasurer from 1931 - 1941. He was the shortest Texas elected official at 3'9" (114&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.

==Early life==
Lockhart born in [[Dallas County, Texas]] in August 1876 to John C. R. and Lucretia Lockhart.  They moved to [[Snyder, Texas]] in 1898.

==Career==
Lockhart was elected [[Scurry County, Texas|Scurry County]] treasurer in 1900. He was re-elected to the county office eight times. In 1919 he went to Austin to work with the [[sergeant-at-arms]] of the [[Texas House of Representatives]].

In 1930 he was elected state treasurer. In 1931, ''Ripley's Believe It Or Not'' featured a drawing of Lockhart under the caption "Texas, the largest state in the Union, has the smallest treasurer, Charley Lockhart, 45 inches tall." The ''[[Houston Post]]'' interviewed Lockhart when he entered the race for the state treasurer's office, and he is quoted as saying, "I want you to make it perfectly clear that I am fighting this battle on manhood alone," he said. "I don't want the votes that are given me through a feeling that life has not handed me a square deal. Life has been good to me. I have filled public office, earned the confidence and friendship of my fellows and educated my children. . . . I'm simply a little man with big ideas and sufficient experience and ability to carry my ideas out..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snydertex.com/history/cemetery.htm Historic Snyder Cemetery|] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717233828/http://www.snydertex.com/history/cemetery.htm |date=July 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He resigned his office on October 24, 1941 and was replaced by his hand-picked Deputy [[Jesse James (Texas Treasurer)|Jesse James]].

The monks supporting the shield in the coat of arms allude to the conquest of Monaco in 1297, when [[François Grimaldi]] entered the city with soldiers dressed as monks, with swords hidden under their cassocks.

==Collar==
The collar surrounding the shield represents the [[Order of Saint-Charles]].

==Motto==
The Grimaldi family's motto, ''Deo Juvante'', is [[Latin]] for "With God's Help".

== Crime ==

Holton, a [[Gulf War]] Veteran, was 36 years old when he shot his three young sons and their half-sister (Stephen Edward Holton (12), Brent Holton (10), Eric Holton (6), and Kayla Marie Holton (4)) with a Chinese-made semi-automatic rifle on November 30, 1997, at the garage where he worked in [[Shelbyville, Tennessee]].  Holton was divorced, and his ex-wife had custody of the children.  About an hour later, Holton turned himself in to the Shelbyville police; he told investigators that he had killed the children because "families should stay together; a father should be with his children."  He said he had also planned to kill his ex-wife and then himself, but had changed his mind.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=49000|title=WBIR.com - Knoxville, TN - Convicted child killer Daryl Holton dies in Tenn. electric chair&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IHT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/10/america/NA-GEN-US-Death-Penalty-Electrocution.php|title=Tennessee plans for first electrocution in nearly 47 years|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=2007-09-10|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial ==

At his June 1999 trial, Holton declined to testify on his own behalf, although his attorney sought to convince the jury that Holton was mentally incompetent at the time of the killings. Witnesses for the defense testified that Holton showed signs of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], although they could not definitively conclude that he had been exposed to carbon monoxide. Psychiatrists for the state and the defense also testified that Holton had [[major depressive disorder]] and [[passive-aggressive personality disorder]] at the time of the murders. The jury rejected the insanity defense; Holton was found guilty and sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/tn-supreme-court/1476832.html|title=FindLaw's Supreme Court of Tennessee case and opinions.|website=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his imprisonment, Holton became an amateur legal expert, and he took steps to ignore the automatic and voluntary appeals process afforded to all condemned men and women under state and U.S. law.  He also declined to cooperate with the federally or state-appointed capital defenders who sought to offer him legal assistance and counsel.  For this reason, he is often included among the group described as death row "volunteers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=1666|title=DPIC - Death Penalty Information Center|website=www.deathpenaltyinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
Holton chose to die in the [[electric chair]], rather than by [[lethal injection]], which is now the standard method of execution in Tennessee.  Death-row inmates who committed their capital crime when the electric chair was still the official execution method are permitted to choose between the two methods.&lt;ref name="IHT" /&gt;  Holton was the first person to be executed by electrocution in Tennessee in 47 years. Moments before his execution, prison warden Ricky Bell asked Holton if he had any final words.  He replied: "Two words: I do".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Raybin|first=David |title=Lawyer for the Condemned: I Witnessed What Should be the Last Electric Chair Execution|url=http://www.hollinslegal.com/2014/06/23/the-last-electric-chair-execution/|publisher=Hollins, Raybin &amp; Weissman, LLC|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He decided against the traditional special last meal before his execution and instead, ate the regular prison meal which consisted of riblets on a bun, mixed vegetables, baked beans, white cake with white icing and iced tea.

Holton's was the fourth execution in Tennessee since 2000 and first by the electric chair since 1960 (the last Pre-[[Furman v. Georgia|Furman]] execution). It was also the first use of Tennessee's electric chair after it was retrofitted by [[Fred A. Leuchter]] and moved to Riverbend from the former [[Tennessee State Prison]].  Holton was the third [[death row]] inmate executed under administration of [[Governor of Tennessee|Governor]] [[Phil Bredesen]]. He was also the first American put to death by electrocution since July 20, 2006. The last was [[Brandon Wayne Hedrick]] in [[Virginia]], who also chose electrocution over injection. His dead body was cremated after his execution. A [https://www.nashvilletnlaw.com/blog/the-last-electric-chair-execution/ first hand account] of the execution was documented by Holton's attorney, David Raybin.

== Controversy ==

His case raised some controversy because of rumors about his history of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcask.org/cases/holton/holton.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While execution of the mentally retarded was prohibited by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'' of 2002, the execution of the mentally ill has never been held to be in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]].{{clarify|reason=Atkins v. Virginia appears to exactly say it's in violation of the Eighth Amendment|date=August 2013}}

Holton, his motives, and the ethics of his execution are examined in the documentary film ''[[Robert Blecker Wants Me Dead]]''.

A '''demon''' is a supernatural and often malevolent being prevalent in [[religion]], [[occultism]], [[literature]], [[fiction]], [[mythology]] and [[folklore]].

The original Greek word ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimon]]'' does not carry negative connotations.&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddaimo%2Fnion |chapter=δαιμόνιον |last1=Liddell |first1= Henry George |authorlink1=Henry Liddell |last2=Scott |first2=Robert |authorlink2=Robert Scott (philologist) |title=[[A Greek–English Lexicon]] |publisher=Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc| δαίμων}} ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimōn]]'' denotes a spirit or divine power, much like the [[Latin]] ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' or ''[[numen]]''.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"&gt;{{cite web|title=Demon|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demon|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek conception of a ''daimōn'' notably appears in the works of [[Plato]], where it describes the divine inspiration of [[Socrates]]. 

In [[Ancient Near Eastern religions]] and in the [[Abrahamic traditions]], including ancient and medieval [[Christian demonology]], a demon is considered a harmful spiritual entity which may cause [[demonic possession]], calling for an [[exorcism]]. 
In Western [[occultism]] and [[Renaissance magic]], which grew out of an amalgamation of [[Greco-Roman magic]], Jewish [[Aggadah]] and [[Christian demonology]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the course synopsis and bibliography for [http://medievalstudies.ceu.hu/courses/20102011/magic-science-religion-the-development-of-the-western-esoteric-traditions "Magic, Science, Religion: The Development of the Western Esoteric Traditions"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129021925/http://medievalstudies.ceu.hu/courses/20102011/magic-science-religion-the-development-of-the-western-esoteric-traditions |date=November 29, 2014 }}, at Central European University, Budapest&lt;/ref&gt; a demon is believed to be a spiritual entity that may be [[conjuration|conjured]] and controlled.

== Etymology ==
{{Further information|Daemon (classical mythology)|Agathodaemon|Cacodemon|Daimonic|Eudaimonia}}
[[File:Ill dict infernal p0139-123 buer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Buer (demon)|Buer]], the 10th spirit, who teaches "Moral and Natural Philosophy" (illustration by Louis Breton from ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'').]]
The [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc| δαίμων}} ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimōn]]'' denotes a spirit or divine power, much like the [[Latin]] ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' or ''[[numen]]''. ''Daimōn'' most likely came from the Greek verb ''daiesthai'' (to divide, distribute).&lt;ref name="merriam-webster" /&gt; The Greek conception of a ''daimōn'' notably appears in the works of [[Plato]], where it describes the divine inspiration of [[Socrates]]. To distinguish the classical Greek concept from its later [[Christian]] interpretation, the former is anglicized as either ''daemon'' or ''daimon'' rather than ''demon''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The original Greek word ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimon]]'' does not carry the negative connotation initially understood by implementation of the [[Koine Greek|Koine]] {{lang|grc|δαιμόνιον}} (''daimonion''),&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott" /&gt; and later ascribed to any cognate words sharing the root.

The Greek terms do not have any connotations of evil or malevolence. In fact, {{lang|grc|εὐδαιμονία}} ''[[eudaimonia]]'', (literally good-spiritedness) means [[happiness]]. By the early [[Roman Empire]], [[cult image|cult statues]] were seen, by [[Paganism|pagans]] and their Christian neighbors alike, as inhabited by the numinous presence of the gods: "Like pagans, Christians still sensed and saw the gods and their power, and as something, they had to assume, lay behind it, by an easy traditional shift of opinion they turned these pagan ''daimones'' into malevolent 'demons', the troupe of [[Satan]]..... Far into the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]] Christians eyed their cities' old pagan statuary as a seat of the demons' presence. It was no longer beautiful, it was infested."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robin Lane |last=Fox |title=Pagans and Christians |year=1989 |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term had first acquired its negative connotations in the [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into Greek, which drew on the mythology of [[ancient Semitic religions]]. This was then inherited by the Koine text of the [[New Testament]]. The Western medieval and neo-medieval conception of a ''demon''&lt;ref&gt;See the Medieval [[grimoire]] called the ''[[Ars Goetia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; derives seamlessly from the ambient [[popular culture]] of [[Late Antiquity]]. The [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] "daemon" eventually came to include many Semitic and Near Eastern gods as evaluated by Christianity.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The supposed existence of demons remains an important concept in many modern religions and occultist traditions. Demons are still feared largely due to their alleged power to [[demonic possession|possess]] living creatures. In the contemporary Western occultist tradition (perhaps epitomized by the work of [[Aleister Crowley]]), a demon (such as [[Choronzon]], which is Crowley's interpretation of the so-called 'Demon of the Abyss') is a useful metaphor for certain inner psychological processes (inner demons), though some may also regard it as an objectively real phenomenon. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, 1987; Black and Rowley, 1987; Duchesne-Guillemin, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; believe that large portions of the [[demonology]] (see [[Asmodai]]) of [[Judaism]], a key influence on [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], originated from a later form of [[Zoroastrianism]], and were transferred to Judaism during the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian era]].

=== Egypt ===
Both deities and demons can act as intermediaries to deliver messages to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Lucarelli ''Demons (Benevolent and Malevolent'' Ucla Encyclpedia of egyptology 2010 p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Thus they share some resemblance to the Greek daimonion. The exact definition of "demon" in Egyptology posed a major problem for modern scholarship, since the borders between a deity and a demon are sometimes blurred and the ancient Egyptian language lacks a term for the modern English "demon".&lt;ref&gt;Rita Lucarelli ''Demons (Benevolent and Malevolent'' Ucla Encyclpedia of egyptology 2010 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siam Bhayro, Catherine Rider ''Demons and Illness from Antiquity to the Early-Modern Period'' BRILL 2017 {{ISBN|978-9-004-33854-8}} p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; However, magical writings indicate that ancient Egyptians acknowledged the existence of malevolent demons by highlighting the demon names with red ink.&lt;ref&gt;Siam Bhayro, Catherine Rider ''Demons and Illness from Antiquity to the Early-Modern Period'' BRILL 2017 {{ISBN|978-9-004-33854-8}} p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Demons in this culture appeared to be subordinative and related to a specific deity, yet they may have occasionally acted independent from the divine will. The existence of demons can be related to the realm of chaos, beyond the created world.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Lucarelli ''Demons (Benevolent and Malevolent'' Ucla Encyclpedia of egyptology 2010 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; But even this negative connotation cannot be denied in light of the magical texts. The role of demons in relation to the human world remains ambivalent and largely depends on context.

Ancient Egyptian demons can be divided into two classes: "guardians" and "wanderers."&lt;ref&gt;Rita Lucarelli ''Demons (Benevolent and Malevolent'' Ucla Encyclpedia of egyptology 2010 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siam Bhayro, Catherine Rider ''Demons and Illness from Antiquity to the Early-Modern Period'' BRILL 2017 {{ISBN|978-9-004-33854-8}} p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; "Guardians" are tied to a specific place; their demonic activity is topographically defined and their function can be benevolent towards those who have the secret knowledge to face them.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Lucarelli ''Demons (Benevolent and Malevolent'' Ucla Encyclpedia of egyptology 2010 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Demons protecting the underworld may prevent human souls from entering paradise. Only by knowing right charms is the deceased able to enter the ''[[Halls of Osiris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dorian Gieseler Greenbaum ''The Daimon in Hellenistic Astrology: Origins and Influence'' BRILL 2015 {{ISBN|9789004306219}} p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the aggressive nature of the guardian demons is motivated by the need to protect their abodes and not by their evil essence. Accordingly, demons guarded sacred places or the gates to the netherworld. During the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] and [[Roman period]], the guardians shifted towards the role of [[Genius loci]] and they were the focus of local and private cults. 

The "wanderers" are associated with possession, mental illness, death and plagues. Many of them serve as executioners for the major deities, such as [[Ra]] or [[Osiris]], when ordered to punish humans on earth or in the netherworld.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Lucarelli ''Demons (Benevolent and Malevolent'' Ucla Encyclpedia of egyptology 2010 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Wanderers can also be agents of chaos, arising from the world beyond creation to bring about misfortune and suffering without any divine instructions, led only by evil motivations. The influences of the wanderers can be warded off and kept at the borders on the human world by the use of magic, but they can never be destroyed. A sub-category of "wanderers" are nightmare demons, which were believed to cause nightmares by entering a human body.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Lucarelli ''Demons (Benevolent and Malevolent'' Ucla Encyclpedia of egyptology 2010 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mesopotamia ===
According to the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], "In [[Chaldea]]n mythology the seven evil deities were known as ''[[shedu]]'', storm-demons, represented in ox-like form."&lt;ref name="JE-shedim"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5085-demonology |chapter=Demonology |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |year=1906 |first1=Emil G. |last1=Hirsch |first2=Richard |last2=Gottheil |first3=Kaufmann |last3=Kohler |first4=Isaac |last4=Broydé}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were represented as [[Sacred bull|winged bulls]], derived from the colossal bulls used as protective jinn of royal palaces.&lt;ref&gt;See Delitzsch, ''Assyrisches Handwörterbuch''. pp. 60, 253, 261, 646; Jensen, ''Assyr.-Babyl. Mythen und Epen'', 1900, p. 453; [[Archibald Sayce]], l.c. pp. 441, 450, 463; [[François Lenormant|Lenormant]], l.c. pp. 48–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Chaldea, the term ''shedu'' traveled to the Israelites. The writers of the Tanach applied the word as a [[dialogism]] to Canaanite deities.

There are indications that demons in popular Hebrew mythology were believed to come from the nether world.&lt;ref&gt;compare {{bibleverse||Isaiah|38:11}} with {{bibleverse||Job|14:13}}; {{bibleverse||Psalms|16:10}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalms|49:16}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Psalms|139:8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various diseases and ailments were ascribed to them, particularly those affecting the brain and those of internal nature. Examples include catalepsy, headache, epilepsy and nightmares. There also existed a demon of blindness, "Shabriri" (lit. "dazzling glare") who rested on uncovered water at night and blinded those who drank from it.&lt;ref name=Isaacs1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isaacs|first1=Ronald H.|title=Ascending Jacob's Ladder: Jewish Views of Angels, Demons, and Evil Spirits|date=1998|publisher=Jason Aronson|isbn=978-0-7657-5965-8|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iLqceVe7S0C&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=shabriri+demon+blindness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=quVL5HVZOY&amp;sig=6LBivAJ52pR9Xp8EGrosJcp9g9A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lNQPVNytE7HsiwKtnIDIDw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=shabriri%20demon%20blindness&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demons supposedly entered the body and caused the disease while overwhelming or "seizing" the victim. To cure such diseases, it was necessary to draw out the evil demons by certain incantations and talismanic performances, at which the [[Essenes]] excelled.&lt;ref name="JE-shedim"/&gt; [[Josephus]], who spoke of demons as "spirits of the wicked which enter into men that are alive and kill them", but which could be driven out by a certain root,&lt;ref&gt;''Bellum Judaeorum'' vii. 6, §&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt; witnessed such a performance in the presence of the Emperor Vespasian&lt;ref&gt;"Antiquities" viii. 2, §&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; and ascribed its origin to [[King Solomon]]. In mythology, there were few defences against Babylonian demons. The mythical mace [[Sharur (mythological weapon)|Sharur]] had the power to slay demons such as [[Asag]], a legendary [[gallu]] or [[edimmu]] of hideous strength.

== Judaism ==
{{See also|Shedim|Dybbuk|Samael}}
[[File:Lilith (John Collier painting).jpg|thumb|upright|In ''[[Lilith (painting)|Lilith]]'' by [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]] (1892), the female demon [[Lilith]] is shown personified within the [[Garden of Eden]]]]
As referring to the existence or non-existence of demons (''[[shedim]]'' or ''[[Se'irim]]'') there are converse opinions in Judaism.&lt;ref name="JE-shedim"/&gt; There are "practically nil" roles assigned to demons in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name="JVL-Demons"&gt;{{cite web|title=Demons &amp; Demonology|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/demons.html|website=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|publisher=The Gale Group|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Judaism today, beliefs in "demons" or "evil spirits" are either ''midot [[hasidic philosophy|hasidut]]'' (Hebr. for "customs of the pious"), and therefore not [[halachah]], or notions based on a [[superstition]] that are non-essential, non-binding parts of Judaism, and therefore not normative Jewish practice. In conclusion, Jews are not obligated to believe in the existence of ''[[shedim]]'', as [[posek]] rabbi [[David Bar-Hayim]] points out.&lt;ref name="YT-eng-source"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bar-Hayim|first1=David|title=Do Jews Believe in Demons and Evil Spirits?-Interview with Rabbi David Bar-Hayim|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iia41D_OLSA|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=Tora Nation Machon Shilo|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tanach ===
The Tanakh mentions two classes of demonic spirits, the ''se'irim'' and the ''shedim''. The word ''shedim'' appears only in two places in the [[Tanakh]] ({{bibleverse||Psalm|106:37}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|32:17}}). The ''se'irim'' are mentioned once in {{bibleverse||Leviticus|17:7}},&lt;ref&gt;www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5085-demonology&lt;/ref&gt; probably a re-calling of [[Assyria]]n demons in shape of goats.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin W. McCraw, Robert Arp ''Philosophical Approaches to Demonology'' Routledge 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-315-46675-0}} page 9&lt;/ref&gt; The ''shedim'' in return are not pagan demigods, but the foreign gods themselves. Both entities appear in a [[Context (language use)#Verbal context|scriptural context]] of animal or [[child sacrifice]] to "non-existent" [[false god]]s.&lt;ref name="JE-shedim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JVL-Demons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Plaut-Shedoim"&gt;{{cite book |first=W. Gunther |last=Plaut |title=The Torah: A Modern Commentary |publisher=Union for Reform Judaism |year=2005 |page=1403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Talmudic tradition ===
{{See also|Talmud|Jerusalem Talmud}}
In the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] notions of ''shedim'' ("demons" or "spirits") are almost unknown or occur only very rarely, whereas in the Babylon Talmud there are many references to ''shedim''  and magical incantations. The existence of ''shedim'' in general was not questioned by most of the Babylonian [[Talmudist]]s. As a consequence of the rise of influence of the Babylonian Talmud over that of the Jerusalem Talmud, late rabbis in general took as fact the existence of ''shedim'', nor did most of the medieval thinkers question their reality. However, rationalists like [[Maimonides]], [[Saadia Gaon]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] and others explicitly denied their existence, and completely rejected concepts of demons, evil spirits, negative spiritual influences, attaching and possessing spirits. Their point of view eventually became mainstream Jewish understanding.&lt;ref name="JE-shedim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D-BH-Shedim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://machonshilo.org/en/eng/component/content/article/34-featured/830-do-jews-believe-in-demons-and-evil-spirits-interview-with-rabbi-david-bar-hayim|title=Do Jews Believe in Demons and Evil Spirits?|publisher=Machon Shilo|last1=Bar-Hayim|first1=David (HaRav)|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kabbalah ===

In [[Kabbalah]] demons are regarded a necessary part of the divine emanation in the material world and a byproduct of human sin ([[Qliphoth]]).&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey W. Dennis ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Myth, Magic and Mysticism: Second Edition'' Llewellyn Worldwide 2016 {{ISBN|978-0-738-74814-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However spirits such as the ''shedim'' may also be benevolent and were used in kabbalistic ceremonies (as with the ''[[golem]]'' of Rabbi Yehuda Loevy) and malevolent ''shedim'' (''mazikin'', from the root meaning "to damage") were often credited with possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0S9CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=Some+benevolent+shedim+were+used+in+kabbalistic+ceremonies+(as+with+the+golem+of+Rabbi+Yehuda+Loevy)+and+malevolent+shedim+(mazikin,+from+the+root+meaning+%22to+damage%22)+were+often+credited+with+possession&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9MWufwWnd_&amp;sig=RseZI6pPfaUOT6cYhqDVTsfsRCU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixtKHv-MbRAhUDMyYKHRLlAbQQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Some%20benevolent%20shedim%20were%20used%20in%20kabbalistic%20ceremonies%20(as%20with%20the%20golem%20of%20Rabbi%20Yehuda%20Loevy)%20and%20malevolent%20shedim%20(mazikin,%20from%20the%20root%20meaning%20%22to%20damage%22)%20were%20often%20credited%20with%20possession&amp;f=false|title=The Esoteric Codex: Supernatural Legends|last=Pettigrove|first=Cedrick|date=2017-01-16|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329053090|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aggadah ===
{{See also|Aggadah|Angels in Judaism}}
Aggadic tales from the Persian tradition describe the ''shedim'', the '' mazziḳim'' ("harmers"), and the '' ruḥin'' ("spirits"). There were also ''[[lilin]]'' ("night spirits"), '' ṭelane'' ("shade", or "evening spirits"), '' ṭiharire'' ("midday spirits"), and '' ẓafrire'' ("morning spirits"), as well as the "demons that bring famine" and "such as cause storm and earthquake".&lt;ref&gt;(Targ. Yer. to Deuteronomy xxxii. 24 and Numbers vi. 24; Targ. to Cant. iii. 8, iv. 6; Eccl. ii. 5; Ps. xci. 5, 6.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JE-shedim"/&gt; According to some [[Aggadah|aggadic]] stories, demons were under the dominion of a king or chief, either [[Asmodai]]&lt;ref&gt;Targ. to Eccl. i. 13; Pes. 110a; Yer. Shek. 49b&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the older Aggadah, [[Samael]] ("the angel of death"), who killed via poison.  Stories in the fashion of this kind of folklore never became an essential feature of Jewish theology.&lt;ref name="D-BH-Shedim" /&gt; Although occasionally an [[Angels in Judaism|angel]] is called ''[[satan]]'' in the Babylon Talmud, this does not refer to a demon: "Stand not in the way of an ox when coming from the pasture, for Satan dances between his horns".&lt;ref&gt;Pes. 112b; compare B. Ḳ. 21a&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second Temple period texts ===
{{See also|Apotropaic magic|Angels in Judaism}}
To the [[Qumran]] community during the [[Second Temple period]] this apotropaic prayer was assigned, stating: "And, I the Sage, declare the grandeur of his radiance in order to frighten and terri[fy] all the spirits of the ravaging angels and the bastard spirits, demons, Liliths, owls" (''Dead Sea Scrolls'', "Songs of the Sage," Lines 4–5).&lt;ref&gt;García, Martínez Florentino. The Dead Sea Scrolls Translated: The Qumran Texts in English. Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florentino Martinez Garcia, ''Magic in the Dead Sea Scrolls: The Metamorphosis of Magic: From Late Antiquity to the Early Modern Period'', compilers Jan Bremmer and Jan R. Veenstra (Leuven: Peeters, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], there exists a fragment entitled "Curses of Belial" (''Curses of Belial (Dead Sea Scrolls, 394, 4Q286(4Q287, fr. 6)=4QBerakhot)''). This fragment holds much rich language that reflects the sentiment shared between the [[Qumran]] towards [[Belial]]. In many ways this text shows how these people thought Belial influenced sin through the way they address him and speak of him. By addressing "Belial and all his guilty lot," (4Q286:2) they make it clear that he is not only impious, but also guilty of sins. Informing this state of uncleanliness are both his "hostile" and "wicked design" (4Q286:3,4). Through this design, Belial poisons the thoughts of those who are not necessarily sinners. Thus a dualism is born from those inclined to be wicked and those who aren't.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frey |first=J. |chapter=Different patterns of dualistic thought in the Qumran library |title=Legal Texts And Legal Issues |year=1984 |page=287 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Belial directly influences sin by the mention of "abominable plots" and "guilty inclination" (4Q286:8,9). These are both mechanisms by which Belial advances his evil agenda that the Qumran have exposed and are calling upon God to protect them from. There is a deep sense of fear that Belial will "establish in their heart their evil devices" (4Q286:11,12). This sense of fear is the stimulus for this prayer in the first place. Without the worry and potential of falling victim to Belial's demonic sway, the Qumran people would never feel impelled to craft a curse. This very fact illuminates the power Belial was believed to hold over mortals, and the fact that sin proved to be a temptation that must stem from an impure origin.

In [[Jubilees]] 1:20, Belial's appearance continues to support the notion that sin is a direct product of his influence. Moreover, Belial's presence acts as a placeholder for all negative influences or those that would potentially interfere with God's will and a pious existence. Similarly to the "gentiles ... [who] cause them to sin against you" (Jubilees 1:19), Belial is associated with a force that drives one away from God. Coupled in this plea for protection against foreign rule, in this case the Egyptians, is a plea for protection from "the spirit of Belial" (Jubilees 1:19). Belial's tendency is to "ensnare [you] from every path of righteousness" (Jubilees 1:19). This phrase is intentionally vague, allowing room for interpretation. Everyone, in one way or another, finds themselves straying from the path of righteousness and by pawning this transgression off on Belial, he becomes a scapegoat for all misguidance, no matter what the cause. By associating Belial with all sorts of misfortune and negative external influence, the Qumran people are henceforth allowed to be let off for the sins they commit.

Belial's presence is found throughout the War Scrolls, located in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and is established as the force occupying the opposite end of the spectrum of God. In Col. I, verse 1, the very first line of the document, it is stated that "the first attack of the Sons of Light shall be undertaken against the forces of the Sons of Darkness, the army of Belial" (1Q33;1:1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nickelsburg |first=George |title=Jewish Literature between the Bible and the Mishna |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dichotomy sheds light on the negative connotations that Belial held at the time.{{sfnp|Frey|1984|p=278}} Where God and his Sons of Light are forces that protect and promote piety, Belial and his Sons of Darkness cater to the opposite, instilling the desire to sin and encouraging destruction. This opposition is only reinforced later in the document; it continues to read that the "holy ones" will "strike a blow at wickedness", ultimately resulting in the "annihilation of the Sons of Darkness" (1Q33:1:13). This epic battle between good and evil described in such abstract terms, however it is also applicable to everyday life and serves as a lens through which the Qumran see the world. Every day is the Sons of Light battle evil and call upon God to help them overcome evil in ways small and large.

Belial's influence is not taken lightly. In Col. XI, verse 8, the text depicts God conquering the "hordes of Belial" (1Q33;11:8). This defeat is indicative of God's power over Belial and his forces of temptation. However the fact that Belial is the leader of hordes is a testament to how persuasive he can be. If Belial was obviously an arbiter of wrongdoing and was blatantly in the wrong, he wouldn't be able to amass an army. This fact serves as a warning message, reasserting God's strength, while also making it extremely clear the breadth of Belial's prowess. Belial's "council is to condemn and convict", so the Qumran feel strongly that their people are not only aware of his purpose, but also equipped to combat his influence (1Q33;13:11).

In the [[Damascus Document]], Belial also makes a prominent appearance, being established as a source of evil and an origin of several types of sin. In Column 4, the first mention of Belial reads: "Belial shall be unleashed against Israel" (4Q266). This phrase is able to be interpreted myriad different ways. Belial is characterized in a wild and uncontrollable fashion, making him seem more dangerous and unpredictable. The notion of being unleashed is such that once he is free to roam; he is unstoppable and able to carry out his agenda uninhibited. The passage then goes to enumerate the "three nets" (4Q266;4:16) by which Belial captures his prey and forces them to sin. "Fornication ..., riches ..., [and] the profanation of the temple" (4Q266;4:17,18) make up the three nets. These three temptations were three agents by which people were driven to sin, so subsequently, the Qumran people crafted the nets of Belial to rationalize why these specific temptations were so toxic. Later in Column 5, Belial is mentioned again as one of "the removers of bound who led Israel astray" (4Q266;5:20). This statement is a clear display of Belial's influence over man regarding sin. The passage goes on to state: "they preached rebellion against ... God" (4Q266;5:21,22). Belial's purpose is to undermine the teachings of God, and he achieves this by imparting his nets on humans, or the incentive to sin.{{sfnp|Nickelsburg|p=147}}

In the ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', Belial controls scores of demons, which are specifically allotted to him by God for the purpose of performing evil.&lt;ref&gt;Dead Sea Scrolls 1QS III 20–25&lt;/ref&gt; Belial, despite his malevolent disposition, is considered an [[Angels in Judaism|angel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Dale Basil |last=Martin |authorlink=Dale Basil Martin |title=When did Angels Become Demons? |journal=[[Journal of Biblical Literature]] |year=2010 |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=657–677 |doi=10.2307/25765960 |jstor=25765960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[shedim]]'', and [[Greek Old Testament|Koine Greek]] δαιμόνιον ''daimonion''; {{bibleverse-nb||Psalms|106:35–39|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|32:17|KJV}}).

==== Pseudepigrapha and Deuterocanonical books ====
{{Main article|Pseudepigrapha|Deuterocanonical books}}{{See also|Book of Tobit|Book of Enoch|Book of Jubilees}}
Demons are sometimes included into biblical interpretation. In the story of Passover, the Bible tells the story as "the Lord struck down all the firstborn in Egypt" (Exodus 12:21–29). In the [[Book of Jubilees]], which is considered canonical only by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref name ="Harris"&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], ''Understanding the Bible''. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. It is considered one of the [[pseudepigrapha]] by [[Protestant]], [[Roman Catholic]], and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches&lt;/ref&gt; this same event is told slightly differently: "All the powers of [the demon] Mastema had been let loose to slay all the first-born in the land of Egypt...And the powers of the Lord did everything according as the Lord commanded them" (Jubilees 49:2–4).

In the [[Genesis flood narrative]] the author explains how God was noticing "how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways" (Genesis 6:12). In Jubilees the sins of man are attributed to "the unclean demons [who] began to lead astray the children of the sons of Noah, and to make to err and destroy them" (Jubilees 10:1). In Jubilees Mastema questions the loyalty of Abraham and tells God to "bid him offer him as a burnt offering on the altar, and Thou wilt see if he will do this command" (Jubilees 17:16). The discrepancy between the story in Jubilees and the story in Genesis 22 exists with the presence of [[Mastema]]. In Genesis, God tests the will of Abraham merely to determine whether he is a true follower, however; in Jubilees Mastema has an agenda behind promoting the sacrifice of Abraham's son, "an even more demonic act than that of the Satan in Job."&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Berstein, ''Angels at the Aqedah: A Study in the Development of a Midrashic Motif'', (Dead Sea Discoveries, 7, 2000), 267.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jubilees, where Mastema, an angel tasked with the tempting of mortals into sin and iniquity, requests that God give him a tenth of the spirits of the children of the watchers, demons, in order to aid the process.&lt;ref&gt;Jubilees 10:7–9&lt;/ref&gt; These demons are passed into Mastema’s authority, where once again, an angel is in charge of demonic spirits.

[[File:Vrubel Demon.jpg|thumb|''Demon Seated'' by [[Mikhail Vrubel]] (1890), an illustration to the Russian romantic poem ''[[Demon (poem)|demon]]'' by [[Mikhail Lermontov]]. Vrubel views this demon as "a spirit, not so much evil as suffering and sorrowing, but in all that a powerful spirit... a majestic spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Sara Elizabeth Hecker.

The sources of demonic influence were thought to originate from the [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]] or [[Nephilim]], who are first mentioned in Genesis 6 and are the focus of 1 Enoch Chapters 1–16, and also in Jubilees 10. The Nephilim were seen as the source of the sin and evil on earth because they are referenced in Genesis 6:4 before the story of the Flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanneken Henoch|first=T. R.|title=ANGELS AND DEMONS IN THE BOOK OF JUBILEES AND CONTEMPORARY APOCALYPSES|year=2006|pages=11–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Genesis 6:5, God sees evil in the hearts of men. The passage states, "the wickedness of humankind on earth was great", and that "Every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only continually evil" (Genesis 5). The mention of the Nephilim in the preceding sentence connects the spread of evil to the Nephilim. Enoch is a very similar story to Genesis 6:4–5, and provides further description of the story connecting the Nephilim to the corruption of humans. In Enoch, sin originates when angels descend from heaven and fornicate with women, birthing giants as tall as 300 cubits. The giants and the angels' departure of Heaven and mating with human women are also seen as the source of sorrow and sadness on Earth. The book of Enoch shows that these fallen angels can lead humans to sin through direct interaction or through providing forbidden knowledge. In Enoch, Semyaz leads the angels to mate with women. Angels mating with humans is against God's commands and is a cursed action, resulting in the wrath of God coming upon Earth. Azazel indirectly influences humans to sin by teaching them divine knowledge not meant for humans. Asael brings down the "stolen mysteries" (Enoch 16:3). Asael gives the humans weapons, which they use to kill each other. Humans are also taught other sinful actions such as beautification techniques, alchemy, astrology and how to make medicine (considered forbidden knowledge at the time). Demons originate from the evil spirits of the giants that are cursed by God to wander the earth. These spirits are stated in Enoch to "corrupt, fall, be excited, and fall upon the earth, and cause sorrow" (Enoch 15:11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=VanderKam|first=James C.|title=THE ANGEL STORY IN THE BOOK OF JUBILEES IN: Pseudepigraphic Perspectives : The Apocrypha And Pseudepigrapha In Light Of The Dead Sea Scrolls|year=1999|pages=151–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Jubilees conveys that sin occurs when Cainan accidentally transcribes astrological knowledge used by the Watchers (Jubilees 8). This differs from Enoch in that it does not place blame on the Angels. However, in Jubilees 10:4 the evil spirits of the Watchers are discussed as evil and still remain on earth to corrupt the humans. God binds only 90 percent of the Watchers and destroys them, leaving 10 percent to be ruled by Mastema. Because the evil in humans is great, only 10 percent would be needed to corrupt and lead humans astray. These spirits of the giants also referred to as "the bastards" in the Apotropaic prayer Songs of the Sage, which lists the names of demons the narrator hopes to expel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vermes|first=Geza|title=The complete Dead Sea scrolls in English|year=2011|publisher=Penguin|location=London|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christian demonology ===
{{Main article|Christian demonology|Exorcism in Christianity|Exorcism in the Catholic Church|Demonic possession#Christianity}}
[[File:Jheronimus Bosch 050 detail 01.jpg|thumb|''[[Death and the Miser]]'' (detail), a [[Hieronymus Bosch]] painting, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
In Christianity, demons are corrupted spirits carrying the execution of Satan's desires. They are generally regarded as three different types of spirits:
* Souls of the wicked deceased, which roam the earth to torment the living.&lt;ref&gt;Victor I. Ezigbo ''Re-imagining African Christologies: Conversing with the Interpretations and Appropriations of Jesus in Contemporary African Christianity'' Wipf and Stock Publishers 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-630-87803-0}} page 235&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nephilim]], who came into being by union between angels and human, but their bodily part were wiped out during the [[Flood myth|Great flood]]. Their spiritual part now desires reembodiment.&lt;ref&gt;Juanita Feros Ruys ''Demons in the Middle Ages'' ISD LLC 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-942-40136-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maijastina Kahlos ''Debate and Dialogue: Christian and Pagan Cultures C. 360–430'' Routledge 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-317-15436-5}} page 174&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fallen angel]]s, who sided with [[Lucifer]] and were cast out of heaven by [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] after battle.

Often deities of other [[religion]]s are interpreted or identified as such "demons" (from the [[Greek Old Testament]] δαιμόνιον ''daimonion'').&lt;ref name="DDD"&gt;van der Toorn, K.; Becking, B.; van der Horst, P. W. (1999), "Demon". In ''Dictionary of Deities and Demons in The Bible'', Second Extensively Revised Edition, pp. 235–240, William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0-8028-2491-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of the [[Devil in Christianity|Christian Devil]] and [[pentagram]] are examples of early rituals and images that showcase evil qualities, as seen by the Christian churches.

Since [[Early Christianity]], demonology has developed from a simple acceptance of demons to a complex study that has grown from the original ideas taken from Jewish demonology and Christian scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orlov|first1=Andrei A.|title=Divine Scapegoats: Demonic Mimesis in Early Jewish Mysticism|date=2015|publisher=SUNY Press|location=New York|isbn=9781438455846|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian demonology is studied in depth within the [[Roman Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/EN/resources/books-1962/rituale-romanum/57-exorcism-introduction.html Exorcism], ''Sancta Missa – Rituale Romanum'', 1962, at [http://www.sanctamissa.org/ sanctamissa.org], Copyright 2007. Canons Regular of St. John Cantius&lt;/ref&gt; although many other Christian churches affirm and discuss the existence of demons.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chadwick (1970), ''Witchcraft at Salem'', p. 132, Signet Classics, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 69-15825&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Modica, Terry Ann (1996), ''Overcoming The Power of The Occult'', p. 31, Faith Publishing Company, {{ISBN|1-880033-24-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building upon the few references to ''daemons'' in the New Testament, especially the poetry of the Book of Revelation, Christian writers of [[apocrypha]] from the 2nd century onwards created a more complicated tapestry of beliefs about "demons" that was largely independent of Christian scripture.

[[File:Schongauer Anthony.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]] plagued by demons, [[The Temptation of St Anthony (Schongauer)|engraving]] by [[Martin Schongauer]] in the 1480s.]]

The contemporary Roman Catholic Church unequivocally teaches that angels and demons are real beings rather than just symbolic devices. The Catholic Church has a cadre of officially sanctioned exorcists which perform many [[exorcism]]s each year. The exorcists of the Catholic Church teach that demons attack humans continually but that afflicted persons can be effectively healed and protected either by the formal rite of exorcism, authorized to be performed only by bishops and those they designate, or by prayers of deliverance, which any Christian can offer for themselves or others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fathercorapi.com/articledet.asp?articleID=1928275639 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405135007/http://www.fathercorapi.com/articledet.asp?articleID=1928275639 |archivedate=2004-04-05 |title=Angels and Demons – Facts not Fiction |website=fathercorapi.com |first=John |last=Corapi |date=February 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times in Christian history, attempts have been made to classify demons according to various proposed [[demonic hierarchy|demonic hierarchies]].

In the Gospels, particularly the [[Gospel of Mark]], Jesus cast out many demons from those afflicted with various ailments. He also lent this power to some of his disciples ({{bibleref2|Luke|10:17}}).

[[Apuleius]], by [[Augustine of Hippo]], is ambiguous as to whether ''daemons'' had become "demonized" by the early 5th century:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Apulieus] also states that the blessed are called in Greek ''eudaimones'', because they are good souls, that is to say, good demons, confirming his opinion that the souls of men are demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |authorlink=Augustine of Hippo |title=City of God |chapter= Chapter 11: Of the Opinion of the Platonists, that the Souls of Men Become Demons When Disembodied |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.IX.11.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Islam ==
[[File:Kitab al-Bulhan -- devil.jpg|thumb|upright|Demons depicted in the [[Book of Wonders]], a late 14th century Arabic manuscript]]
[[File:Muhammad and "shameless women" in Hell.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of a member of the Zabaniyya]]
[[Islam]] and Islam-related beliefs acknowledges the concept of evil spirits known as malevolent [[Jinn]], [[Ifrit|Afarit]] and [[Shaitan|Shayatin]]. Unlike the belief in [[Angels in Islam|angels]], belief in demons is not obligated by [[the six articles of Islamic faith]].&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p.&amp;nbsp;48 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the existence of several demonic spirits is generally assumed by [[Islamic theology]] and further elaborated beliefs persist in Islamic folklore. Furthermore the Quran mentions the ''[[Zabaniyya]]'', who torture the damned in hell, who may originated from a class of Arabian demons.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lange ''Paradise and Hell in Islamic Traditions'' Cambridge University Press 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-316-41205-3}} page 52&lt;/ref&gt; However, their execution of punishment is in accordance with Gods order, therefore they are not equalized with Shayatin, who in turn are rebellious against the divine will.
 
===Jinn and Shayatin===
Rather than demonic, Jinn are depicted as close to humans regarded as living in societies, in need of dwelling places, eating and drinking, and although their lifespan exceeds those of humans over centuries, they die and also need to procreate, but because they are created from ''smokeless fire'' in contrast to humans made from ''solid earth'', the latter can not see them. As for humans, Jinn are also subject to temptations of the Shayatin and [[Satan]] therefore may either be good or evil.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Muhaimin ''The Islamic Traditions of Cirebon: Ibadat and Adat Among Javanese Muslims'' AnU E Press 2006 {{ISBN|978-1-920-94231-1}} page 46&lt;/ref&gt; Evil Jinn are comparable to demons, scaring or possessing humans. In folklore some [[Ghoul|Jinn]] may also lurk on lonely travelers to dissuade them from their paths and eat their corpses. Although not evil, a Jinni may haunt a person, because it feels offended by him. Islam has no binding origin story of Jinn, but Islamic beliefs commonly assume that the Jinn were created on a Thursday thousands of years before mankind. Therefore Islamic medieval narratives often called them ''[[Pre-Adamite]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-815-65070-6}} page 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherweise the Shayatin are the Islamic equivalent of "demons" in western usage.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Mathewes ''Understanding Religious Ethics'' John Wiley &amp; Sons {{ISBN|978-1-405-13351-7}}. p.&amp;nbsp;249&lt;/ref&gt;
Islam differs in regard of the origin of demons. They may either be a class of heavenly creatures cast out of [[Jannah|heaven]] or the descendants of [[Iblis]].&lt;ref name="Robert Lebling"&gt;Robert Lebling ''Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar'' I.B.Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}} page 141&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Jinn and humans, Shayatin are immortal and will just die, then the world perishes, however prayers could dissolve or banish them.&lt;ref&gt;Hajjah Amina Adil ''Muhammad the Messenger of Islam: His Life &amp; Prophecy'' BookBaby 2012 {{ISBN|978-1-618-42913-1}} chapter Ezra&lt;/ref&gt; However unlike Jinn and human, Shayatin can not attain salvation. Further they are thought to attempt to reach to heaven, but are chased away from the Angels or shooting stars. The Shayatin do not possess people, but "whisper" to their minds and seduce them into falsehood and sin. These are called ''waswās'' and may enter the [[Qalb|hearts]] of humans to support negative feelings, especially in states of strong emotion like depression or anger.&lt;ref&gt;ʻUmar Sulaymān Ashqar''The World of the Jinn and Devils'' Islamic Books 1998 page 203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ifrit===
Another demonic spirit is called [[Ifrit]] and although there are no descriptions regarding an Iftrits behavior found in Islamic canonical texts, [[Folk Islam]] often depicts them with traits of malevolent [[ghost]], returning after death or a subcategory of Shayatin drawn the life-force of those who were murdered. However they are not exactly Shayatin since they differ in their origin.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Muhaimin ''The Islamic Traditions of Cirebon: Ibadat and Adat Among Javanese Muslims'' ANU E Press 2006 {{ISBN|978-1-920-94231-1}} page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hinduism ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
{{Original research|date=May 2018}}
[[Hinduism|Hindu]] beliefs include numerous varieties of spirits that might be classified as demigods, including [[Vetala]]s, [[Bhoot (ghost)|Bhutas]] and [[Pishachas]]. [[Rakshasas]] and [[Asuras]] are often misunderstood to be as demons. There are no demons in Hinduism as hinduism is not based on good and evil and is not constructed by the principle of duality. 

=== Asuras ===
[[File:The Army of Super Creatures.jpg|thumb|The Army of Super Creatures – from The Saugandhika Parinaya Manuscript (1821 CE)]]
Originally, ''Asura'', in the earliest hymns of the [[Rig Veda]], meant any supernatural spirit, either good or bad. Since the /s/ of the Indic linguistic branch is cognate with the /h/ of the Early Iranian languages, the word ''Asura'', representing a category of celestial beings, became the word ''Ahura'' (Mazda), the Supreme God of the monotheistic [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]]. Ancient Hinduism tells that [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] (also called ''suras'') and [[Asura]]s are half-brothers, sons of the same father [[Kashyapa]]; although some of the Devas, such as [[Varuna]], are also called Asuras. Later, during [[Puranic]] age, [[Asura]] and [[Rakshasa]] came to exclusively mean any of a race of anthropomorphic, powerful, possibly evil beings. Daitya (lit. sons of the mother "Diti"), Rakshasa (lit. from "harm to be guarded against"), and Asura are incorrectly translated into English as "demon".

Post Vedic, Hindu scriptures, pious, highly enlightened Asuras, such as [[Prahlada]] and [[Vibhishana]], are not uncommon. The Asura are not fundamentally against the gods, nor do they tempt humans to fall. Many people metaphorically interpret the Asura as manifestations of the ignoble passions in the human mind and as a symbolic devices. There were also cases of power-hungry Asuras challenging various aspects of the Gods, but only to be defeated eventually and seek forgiveness—see [[Surapadman]] and [[Narakasura]].

=== Evil spirits ===
Hinduism advocates the reincarnation and transmigration of souls according to one's [[karma]]. Souls ([[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) of the dead are adjudged by the [[Yama]] and are accorded various purging punishments before being reborn. Humans that have committed extraordinary wrongs are condemned to roam as lonely, often mischief mongers, spirits for a length of time before being reborn. Many kinds of such spirits ([[Vetala]]s, [[Pishacha]]s, [[Bhoot (ghost)|Bhūta]]) are recognized in the later Hindu texts.

== Bahá'í Faith ==
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], demons are not regarded as independent evil spirits as they are in some faiths. Rather, evil spirits described in various faiths' traditions, such as Satan, fallen angels, demons and jinn, are metaphors for the base character traits a human being may acquire and manifest when he turns away from God and follows his lower nature. Belief in the existence of ghosts and earthbound spirits is rejected and considered to be the product of superstition.&lt;ref name="Psmith112"&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Peter | year = 2008 | title = An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = Cambridge | isbn=978-0-521-86251-6 | ref = harv | page = 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ceremonial magic ==
While some people fear demons, or attempt to exorcise them, others willfully attempt to summon them for knowledge, assistance, or power. The ceremonial magician usually consults a [[grimoire]], which gives the names and abilities of demons as well as detailed instructions for conjuring and controlling them. Grimoires are not limited to demons – some give the names of angels or spirits which can be called, a process called [[theurgy]]. The use of ceremonial magic to call demons is also known as [[goetia]], the name taken from a section in the famous grimoire known as the ''[[Lesser Key of Solomon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Waite, ''The Book of Black Magic'', (Weiser Books, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wicca ==
According to [[Rosemary Ellen Guiley]], "Demons are not courted or worshipped in contemporary [[Wicca]] and [[Paganism]]. The existence of negative energies is acknowledged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca |page=95 |first=Rosemary |last=Guiley |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern interpretations ==
[[File:Japanese demon mask.jpg|thumb|upright|The classic [[Oni|Japanese demon]], an ogre-like creature which often has horns.]]
Psychologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]] remarked that "among the activities attributed by myths all over the world to demons, the harmful predominate, so that in popular belief bad demons are clearly older than good ones."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freud|1950|p=65}}, quoting Wundt (1906, 129).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] developed this idea and claimed that the concept of demons was derived from the important relation of the living to the dead: "The fact that demons are always regarded as the spirits of those who have died ''recently'' shows better than anything the influence of mourning on the origin of the belief in demons."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freud|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[M. Scott Peck]], an American psychiatrist, wrote two books on the subject, ''People of the Lie: The Hope For Healing Human Evil''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peck |first=M. S. |authorlink=M. Scott Peck |year=1983 |title=People of the Lie: The Hope For Healing Human Evil}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Glimpses of the Devil: A Psychiatrist's Personal Accounts of Possession, Exorcism, and Redemption''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peck |first=M. S. |authorlink=M. Scott Peck |year=2005 |title=Glimpses of the Devil: A Psychiatrist's Personal Accounts of Possession, Exorcism, and Redemption}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peck describes in some detail several cases involving his patients. In ''People of the Lie'' he provides identifying characteristics of an evil person, whom he classified as having a character disorder. In ''Glimpses of the Devil'' Peck goes into significant detail describing how he became interested in [[exorcism]] in order to debunk the ''myth'' of [[Demonic possession|possession]] by evil spirits – only to be convinced otherwise after encountering two cases which did not fit into any category known to [[psychology]] or [[psychiatry]]. Peck came to the conclusion that possession was a rare phenomenon related to evil and that possessed people are not actually evil; rather, they are doing battle with the forces of evil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2005/01/18/peck_5/ The exorcist], an interview with M. Scott Peck by Rebecca Traister published in [http://www.salon.com/index.html Salon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219102002/http://www.salon.com/news/col/horo/1999/12/13/betty/index.html |date=2005-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Peck's earlier work was met with widespread popular acceptance, his work on the topics of evil and possession has generated significant debate and derision. Much was made of his association with (and admiration for) the controversial [[Malachi Martin]], a [[Roman Catholic]] priest and a former [[Jesuit]], despite the fact that Peck consistently called Martin a liar and a manipulator.&lt;ref name="Woods" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/159/story_15928.html The Patient Is the Exorcist], an interview with M. Scott Peck by Laura Sheahen&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Woods, a Roman Catholic priest and theologian, has claimed that Dr. Peck misdiagnosed patients based upon a lack of knowledge regarding [[dissociative identity disorder]] (formerly known as multiple personality disorder) and had apparently transgressed the boundaries of [[professional ethics]] by attempting to persuade his patients into accepting Christianity.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;[http://www.natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2005b/042905/042905m.htm The devil you know], ''National Catholic Reporter, April 29, 2005, a commentary on ''Glimpses of the Devil'' by Richard Woods&lt;/ref&gt; Father Woods admitted that he has never witnessed a genuine case of demonic possession in all his years.&lt;ref name="WoodsInfo"&gt;[http://www.dom.edu/newsroom/experts/faculty/faculty_w.html#woods Dominican Newsroom] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829121523/http://www.dom.edu/newsroom/experts/faculty/faculty_w.html#woods |date=August 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodsBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richardwoodsop.net/site/Bio.php |title=RichardWoodsOP.net |publisher=RichardWoodsOP.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228051312/http://richardwoodsop.net/site/Bio.php |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bustedhalo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Haarman |first=Susan |url=http://bustedhalo.com/features/the-devil-and-the-details/2 |title=BustedHalo.com |publisher=BustedHalo.com |date=2005-10-25 |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to S. N. Chiu, God is shown sending a demon against Saul in 1 Samuel 16 and 18 in order to punish him for the failure to follow God's instructions, showing God as having the power to use demons for his own purposes, putting the demon under his divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S. N. |last=Chiu |title=Historical, Religious, and Medical Perspectives of Possession Phenomenon |journal=Hong Kong Journal of Psychiatry |year=2000 |volume=10 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Britannica Concise Encyclopedia'', demons, despite being typically associated with evil, are often shown to be under divine control, and not acting of their own devices.&lt;ref&gt;"Demon" in Britannica Concise Encyclopedia,&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4476">[[File:Beato, Felice A. - Beim Barbier (Zeno Fotografie).jpg|thumb|''The Barber,'' photograph by Felix A. Beato, c. 1875]]

'''Felice A. Beato''' and '''Felice Antonio Beato''' are collective [[signature]]s used by the brothers [[Felice Beato]] and [[Antonio Beato]], who were both pioneering [[photographer]]s in the 19th century. They were noted for their depictions of everyday life in Orient.

==Description==
The brothers sometimes worked together, signing their photographs collectively. Consequently, it was long assumed that such photographs were the work of one photographer who somehow managed to photograph at the same time in places as distant as [[Egypt]] and [[Japan]]. It was only in 1983 that the truth of the matter was revealed, in a paper by [[Italo Zannier]].&lt;ref&gt;Zannier, Italo. ''Verso oriente: Fotografie di Antonio e Felice Beato,'' Florence: Alinari, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The confusion arising from the signatures continues to cause problems in identifying which of the two photographers was the creator of a given image. Both signatures may refer to either or both photographers.

The brothers were active in the Middle East and Asia from the early 1850s through to the early 20th century and were among the very first photographers to take photographs of the Orient. At that time, tourist travel to Middle East created strong demand for photographs as souvenirs. The Beato brothers were part of a group of early photographers who made their way to the East to capitalise on this demand. These pioneering photographers included Frenchmen, [[Félix Bonfils]] (1831-1885); [[Gustave Le Gray]] (1820-1884) and [[Hippolyte Arnoux]], brothers Henri and Emile Bechard and the Greek [[Adelphoi Zangaki|Zangaki brothers]], many of whom were in Egypt at the same time and entered into both formal and informal working partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, K., ''Odalisques and Arabesques: Orientalist Photography, 1839-1925,'' London,  Bernard Quaritch, 2007, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;  These early photographers, including the Beato Brothers, were among the first commercial photographers to produce images on a large scale in the Middle East.

From time to time, the brothers split up and joined with other pioneering photographers for specific projects. In 1855, one of the brothers, Felix, teamed up with the pair's brother-in-law, [[James Robertson (photographer)|James Robertson]] and travelled to the Crimea where they assumed responsibility for war photography.&lt;ref&gt;Hannavy, J., ''Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography,'' Routledge, 2013, p. 128; Greenough, p. 21; Pare, "Roger Fenton", p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; and made their reputation by depicting the destruction and death associated with the conflict. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Gartlan, L., "James Robertson and Felice Beato in the Crimea: Recent Findings," ''History of Photography,'' Vol. 29, No. 1, 2005, pp 72-80&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1858 Antonio joined Felice in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. Felice had been in [[India]] since the beginning of the year photographing the aftermath of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], but Antonio left India the following year for health reasons, and headed for Malta by way of [[Suez]]. By the early 1860, Antonio was in [[Cairo]] where he opened a photographic studio and went into partnership with the French photographer, [[Hippolyte Arnoux]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, K., ''Odalisques and Arabesques: Orientalist Photography, 1839-1925,'' London,  Bernard Quaritch, 2007, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, the brothers were living and working in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, T., ''History of Photography in China, 1842–1860,'' London, Bernard Quaritch, 2009, p. 141 and 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beato Brothers images of Egypt were distinctly different to those of other pioneering photographers working in the Orient. Whereas most photographers focussed on the grandeur of monuments and architecture, the Beatos concentrated on scenes of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Hannavy, J. (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography,'' Routledge, 2013, pp 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foreign, comparative, and international law librarians''', also known as FCIL librarians, are law librarian specialists who work specifically with three primary varieties of extra-jurisdictional law.  FCIL librarians work with foreign law, [[comparative law]], and [[international law]].  Foreign laws are the laws of any international jurisdiction.  Comparative laws are “the scholarly study of the similarities and differences between the legal systems of different jurisdictions.”&lt;ref&gt;Rumsey, Mary. (2006). Foreign and International Law Librarianship. Legal Reference Services Quarterly, 25(2/3), 73-88.&lt;/ref&gt; International law is the law of international organizations, such as the United Nations, and the laws between nations, such as those established by treaty.

'''Franc Miklošič''' (also known in German as {{lang|de|'''Franz Xaver Ritter von Miklosich'''}}) (20 November 1813 – 7 March 1891) was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[philology|philologist]].

==Early life==
Miklošič was born in the small village of [[Radomerščak]] near the [[Lower Styria]]n town of [[Ljutomer]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. He graduated from the [[University of Graz]] with a doctor of philosophy degree.

==Career==
He was professor of philosophy at the University of Graz. In 1838, he went to the [[University of Vienna]], where he received the degree of doctor of law. During his studies, he became influenced by the works of the Slovenian philologist and linguist [[Jernej Kopitar]]. He abandoned law, devoting most of his later life to the study of [[Slavic languages]].

In 1844, he obtained a post at the [[Austrian National Library|Imperial Library of Vienna]], where he remained to 1862. In 1844, he published a  review of [[Franz Bopp]]'s book ''Comparative Grammar,'' which attracted attention from the Viennese academic circles. This publication then launched a long series of works, in which Miklošič showed an immense erudition. His works led to a revolutionary change in the study of Slavic languages.

In 1849 Miklošič was appointed to the newly created chair of Slavic philology at the [[University of Vienna]], and he occupied it until 1886. He became a member of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Vienna]], which appointed him secretary of its historical and philosophical section, a member of the council of public instruction and of the upper house, and correspondent of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres|French Academy of Inscriptions and Humanities]]. His numerous writings deal not only with the Slavic languages, but also with [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Romani language|Romani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mojaslovenija.net/veliki_slovenci/veliki_slovenci_franc_miklosic.html |title=Veliki Slovenci: Franc Miklošič |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Great Slovenes: Franc Miklošič |work=Moja Slovenija [My Slovenia] |first=Tomaž |last=Štefe |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625064902/http://www.mojaslovenija.net/veliki_slovenci/veliki_slovenci_franc_miklosic.html |archivedate=2011-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1872-1880, Miklošič published his original survey of Romani dialects, ''Über die Mundarten und Wanderungen der Zigeuner Europas''. This work included a discussion of their origins, migration routes, an historical-comparative grammar, and a lexicon. He identified a substantial Greek element that was shared by the Romani dialects, and thus named a "Greek-speaking area" as the "European homeland of the Gypsies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/whatis/linguistics/history.shtml |title=ROMANI Project - Manchester |publisher=Romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political engagement==
In the [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] of 1848, Miklošič, who was 35 at the time, actively engaged in the [[Slovene national movement]]. He was the chairman of the political association, called ''Slovenija'' (Slovenia) organized by Slovene students that studied in [[Graz]] and [[Vienna]]. Together with [[Matija Majar]] and [[Lovro Toman]], he was among the authors who elaborated the political demand for a [[United Slovenia]]. After the failure of the revolutionary requests, he again turned to an exclusively academic activity.

'''Francisco el Hombre ''(Francisco the Man)''''' is a legendary character of [[Colombian folklore]]. He is the archetype of a ''juglar'' (roughly translated, jester or minstrel), a traditional player of [[Vallenato]], a traditional Colombian genre of music. It is generally acknowledged that the popularly known story of Francisco el Hombre contains elements of myth, as well as historical fact.&lt;ref name=cultura&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mincultura.gov.co/areas/patrimonio/publicaciones/Documents/LIBRO%20FRANCISCO%20EL%20HOMBRE.compressed.pdf |title=Francisco El Hombre: Juglar y Leyenda |access-date=May 25, 2016 |publisher=[[Ministerio de Cultura (Colombia)|Ministerio de Cultura]] |first=Alexander |last=Casalins Pérez |first2=César Augusto |last2=Sánchez Contreras |first3=Berena |last3=Vergara Serpa |isbn=978-958-58950-3-4 |location=Cartagena de Indias |date=September 2014 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{see also|Vallenato}}

Vallenato is a very important part of the [[culture of Colombia|Colombian culture]] as a whole, but especially [[Caribbean region of Colombia|its region on the Caribbean Coast]]. It originated in the ''Valle de Upar'' (Valley of Upar), which is also the origin of the genre's name (Vallenato literally translates to 'Born in the Valley' ''Valle=Valley, Nato=Born''). There are a couple of integral aspects to the traditions surrounding Vallenato that are also important for the legend of Francisco el Hombre. The first is the instruments traditional to the playing of Vallenato, especially the accordion. The second is the concept of the ''piqueria''. A ''piqueria'' is a showdown between two ''juglares'' of Vallenato. They are freestyle competitions where the participating ''juglares'' battle over who has the better accordion-playing skills, as well as who can freestyle sing better verses challenging and insulting the other. The concept of a ''piqueria'' is somewhat comparable to the [[Battle rap|"rap battle"]] of American [[Hip Hop|hip hop culture]], except for the added component of playing the accordion while delivering verses. The famous song, ''[[La Gota Fría]]'' (The Cold Sweat) is a good example of a ''piqueria vallenata''.

==The Legend==
Legend has it that Francisco travelled throughout Colombia, going from town to town participating in ''piquerias'', which he always emerged victorious from. One night, as he travelled, he pulled out his accordion and began playing some notes and singing to occupy himself as he walked. Suddenly, he realized that every tune he played was answered by a better one from afar. He spent several hours searching for his opponent in the darkness, to no avail. Suddenly, a ray of moonlight burst through the clouds and shone down on his adversary, revealing his identity: it was Satan himself. Upon revealing himself, the devil played a powerful song, so powerful that the light of the moon and stars were snuffed out, leaving his burning eyes as the only source of light in the night. Understanding that this would be his greatest battle, the ''juglar'' fell to his knees, looked up to heaven, [[Sign of the cross|signed the cross]], and prayed the [[Apostles' Creed]] forwards and backwards. He then got up and played the most beautiful melody ever heard. The moon and stars returned to the sky. The devil let out an ear-piercing scream, and fled into the mountains, leaving Francisco as the winner of the duel, and bestowing upon him the moniker of ''el Hombre'' (the Man).&lt;ref name=cultura/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.festivalvallenato.com/html/el_folclor/el_folclor_vallenato_mitos_y_leyendas_la_leyenda_de_francisco_el_hombre.htm

==The historical Francisco el Hombre==
There is dispute over who (if anyone) the legend of Francisco el Hombre is based on, but it is generally accepted that it was either Francisco Moscote Guerra, or Francisco Rada Batista.&lt;ref name=cultura/&gt;

Francisco Moscote Guerra was a famous Vallenato player from the town of [[Plato, Magdalena|Plato]] in the [[Departments of Colombia|administrative department]] of [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]]. He is mentioned in the novel [[One Hundred Years of Solitude]] as "an old globe-trotter of almost 200 years who frequently passed by Macondo divulging the songs composed by himself". The [[Ministry of Culture (Colombia)|Colombian Ministry of Culture]] considers him the most probable candidate.&lt;ref name=cultura/&gt;

Francisco Rada Batista, also known as "Pancho Rada," (1907-2003) is also proposed as the legendary figure. He was certainly a legendary Vallenato artist. He is credited with revolutionizing the genre throughout his life, and is also credited with inventing the Vallenato subgenre known as ''son''. the 2000 documentary film ''The Devil's Accordion'' asserts that he is the namesake of the legendary figure.

Regardless of who his true identity may have been, his image has deeply permeated throughout Colombia. The world's largest Vallenato festival, held in the genre's birthplace of Valle Dupar is called ''Festival de la Leyenda Vallenata'' (Festival of the Vallanato Legend). Another large Colombian music Festival is simply called, Festival Francisco el Hombre. Many images, statues, and sculptures of him can also be found over the country.

'''George C. Contant''', aka '''George Contant Sontag''' (April 10, 1864 - date of death unknown), was an [[outlaw]] of the [[American West]] known mostly for train [[robbery|robberies]]. Like his older brother, [[John Sontag]], he was originally from [[Mankato, Minnesota|Mankato]], [[Minnesota]].

==Background==

Contant was the younger of two sons of Jacob Contant and the former Maria Bohn. After the death of their father in 1867, [[John Sontag]] took the surname of his stepfather, Matthias Sontag, his mother's second husband, a veteran of the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=minn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnriv.com/sontag.html|title=The Sontag Brothers: Southern Minnesota's Own Train Robbers|publisher=mnriv.com|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Contant however kept the original name though the two were usually called ''The Sontag Brothers''.&lt;ref name=eshom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eshomvalley.com/sontag_evans.html|title=Sontag and Evans|publisher=eshomvalley.com|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two were frequent partners in crime. After he stole cigars from an employer, George Contant was sent to [[reform school]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], Minnesota. After a subsequent conviction for [[theft]], Contant was imprisoned at the [[Nebraska State Penitentiary]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]]. There is a marriage record of George Contant married to Therese Landgraff (1865-1898) on October 11, 1887 in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]]; they had at least one child George Contant (1887-1896).&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/2:2:3HS7-1QQ LDs family search]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime and punishment==

With his brother imprisoned in [[Nebraska]], John Sontag came to [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[California]], and began working for the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company]]. After an industrial accident, he was employed near [[Visalia, California|Visalia]], California, by a farmer and [[Livery yard|livery stable]] operator, who soon became his partner in crime, [[Christopher Evans (outlaw)|Christopher "Chris" Evans]].&lt;ref name=histevanson&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wendtroot.com/cockrill/d0002/d0002notes/EvansSontagStory.html|title=A Brief History of Evans &amp; Sontag|publisher=wendtroot.com|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Contant was released from prison in Lincoln, he joined his brother and Chris Evans on a trip to Minnesota, where on July 1, 1892, they attempted to rob a train while riding along the [[Minnesota River]] between [[St. Peter, Minnesota|St. Peter]] and [[Kasota, Minnesota|Kasota]]. They acquired nothing of much value, but their crime aroused the concern of [[Allan Pinkerton|Pinkerton detective]]s.&lt;ref name=minn/&gt; A month later, back in California, the trio robbed a train at [[Collis, California|Collis]], now [[Kerman, California|Kerman]] in [[Fresno County, California|Fresno County]]. This time, they acquired $500 and bags of [[Mexico|Mexican]] and [[Peru]]vian coins of no apparent value. Several days after the robbery, law-enforcement officers arrested Contant in connection with the crime, but Sontag and Evans fled as fugitives. A nationally-publicized manhunt culminated in what is known as the [[Battle of Stone Corral]].&lt;ref name=eshom/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1ocAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=John+Sontag+and+Chris+Evans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Vxqg7OH0fi&amp;sig=8RM5fn_DNVyCfFSHacjwsxEHt1M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fIi3UKO3FoTlqgH_roDQAQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Sontag%20and%20Chris%20Evans&amp;f=fals|title=Thomas Samuel Duke, Celebrated Criminal Cases of America|publisher=[[San Francisco, California]]: James H. Barry Company, 1910), pp.277-286|accessdate=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Found guilty of train robbery at Collis in October 1892, Contant was incarcerated for fifteen years at [[Folsom State Prison]].

==Post Prison life==
After his release from prison, George Contant wrote an [[autobiography]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cUY5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=George+Contant-Sontang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRyJDi5MjKAhVklYMKHdMXCysQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=George%20Contant-Sontang&amp;f=false A Pardoned Lifer],'' in 1909 with Opie L.

'''Gérard Paul Errera''' (born 30 October 1943) is a [[France|French]] diplomat and serves as an advisor to a number of American, Chinese and French international firms.

== Early life and education ==

Gérard Errera comes from a Jewish family, and was born in [[Brives-la-Gaillarde|Brive-la-Gaillarde]], in what was, during World War II, France's Free Zone. The Erreras were hidden and saved by a French family during the German occupation under the Vichy regime. Right after the war, he moved to Paris where he completed his education, and graduated from two French elite institutions, [[L'Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris]] (Sciences Po),&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Sciences Po People]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ecole Nationale d'Administration]] (ENA).

Gérard Errera is the brother of Roger Errera (1933–2014), who was a member of the Conseil d'Etat, and director of the Diaspora series (Calmann-Lévy), and whose life and work is remembered through a website: www.rogererrera.fr. 

== Current career and board memberships ==

Errera is chairman of the [[Blackstone Group]] France, and member of Blackstone International Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackstone.com/news-views/details/gerard-errera-is-appointed-chairman-of-blackstone-france&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the Senior Adviser for International Affairs to the French law firm August &amp; Debouzy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.august-debouzy.com/en&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of International Advisory Council of Huawei,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huawei.com/en/|title=Huawei - Building a Fully Connected, Intelligent World|website=huawei}}&lt;/ref&gt; the leading global information and communications technology provider.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalcapitalconference.com/fr/gerard-errera&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Errera also serves on the advisory committee of the [[International Capital Conference]] (ICC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalcapitalconference.com/|title=International Capital Conference (ICC)|website=www.internationalcapitalconference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an annually held forum gathering China's top entrepreneurs, CEOs and officials with their European counterparts.

== Diplomatic career ==

Errera has spent the last two years before joining Blackstone as secretary general of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 2007 to 2009. This is the highest-ranking position in the French Foreign service, and effectively oversaw the foreign policy and all French diplomatic missions, alongside the minister.&lt;ref name="lefigaro.fr"&gt;http://www.lefigaro.fr/magazine/20070928.MAG000000469_les_nouveaux_hommes_forts_de_la_diplomatie_franaise.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During that time, Errera was appointed by the French president Sarkozy, as "Ambassadeur de France", a lifelong dignity, and the highest title a French career diplomat.&lt;ref name="lefigaro.fr"/&gt;

Prior to this Errera was the French ambassador to the United Kingdom for five years, from 2002 to 2007. At a time when Franco-British relationships were particularly tense, Gerard Errera was especially appreciated by the British, being called by the press "one of the wittiest and wisest diplomats in modern times, a worthy follower in the footsteps of Talleyrand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/28/politics.france | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Leader: In praise of... Gerard Errera | date=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Errera was a fierce defender of the principled and moral view not to invade Iraq, and was characterised as a"model of discretion, and master of the unspoken inference".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/Model-of-discretion-interview-with&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served as the French ambassador to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nato.int/cv/permrep/fr/fr-f.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and director general for political affairs. During that time, he was one of the architects of the [[St Malo Treaty]] in 1998, which was the founding moment of European defence&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uaces.org/pdf/events/ErreraEnglish.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the French special representative of President Chirac for strategic dialogue with India during 1998–2002. Before that, Gerard Errera was director for international affairs at the French Atomic Energy Commission and governor for France at the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. From 1991 to 1995, he served as the French ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.

Errera started his career at the French embassy in Washington, then was appointed as special adviser to the French foreign minister. He also served as the French general consul in San Francisco, at the time of the development of the Silicon Valley, and in Madrid from 1977 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalcapitalconference.com/speakers/GerardErrera.html|title=ICC Speakers: - International Capital Conference|website=www.internationalcapitalconference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Salem was born on 11 November 1933 in [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=tal28jun&gt;{{cite news|last=Talaat |first=Nayrouz |title=A man worth $58.7 billion |url=http://213.158.162.45/~egyptian/index.php?action=news&amp;id=19504&amp;title=A%20man%20worth%20$58.7%20billion |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312130029/http://213.158.162.45/~egyptian/index.php?action=news&amp;id=19504&amp;title=A%20man%20worth%20$58.7%20billion |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=3 March 2013 |newspaper=The Egyptian Gazette |date=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Records of the Egyptian Administrative Control Authority indicate, however, that he was born in the [[Helwan]] suburb of Cairo, although ''[[al-Ahram Weekly]]'' states the latter location was actually Salem's father's birthplace. His father, Kamal el-Din, worked as a school teacher, but died of [[typhoid]] during Salem's childhood. Afterward, his family moved to an apartment in the Korba area of Cairo's [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]] district.&lt;ref name="AhramPart1"&gt;[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/14777/Egypt/Politics-/Hussein-Salem-A-businessman-from-the-times-of-cron.aspx Hussein Salem: A businessman from the times of crony capitalism, Part 1]. ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]''. 21 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother, Hosnia Tabozoda, who was of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] origin, encountered great difficulty providing for her children with her late husband's pension, forcing Salem, the eldest of his two siblings to become the family's main provider. He also had five half-siblings from his father's first wife (Hosnia was his second wife,) but was not responsible for them, most of whom were older than Salem. Although it has not been proven, he allegedly has [[Bedouin]] origins. Some sources say this was a rumor Salem allegedly spread in order to help him secure future business deals with the Bedouin tribes of the southern [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The only known relation Salem had with the Bedouin was through marriage; his half-sibling Samiha married into the Abaydah tribe of [[Ismailia]] and Sinai.&lt;ref name="AhramPart1"/&gt;

During his childhood, Salem's sustained an eye injury, disallowing him from entering the mandatory military service. He graduated from the Heliopolis Public High School, but had to repeat his senior year. In 1956, he graduated from [[Cairo University]]'s Faculty of Commerce.&lt;ref name="AhramPart1"/&gt; Shortly after receiving his degree, one of Salem's relatives secured a job for him as a clerk in the Textile Support Fund, which then-president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] had established to alleviate high unemployment rates, particularly among the youth. Later in 1956, Nasser nationalized the [[Suez Canal Company]], prompting a tripartite assault on Egypt by the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Israel]]. Although Salem favored open markets, there has been no indication that he opposed the canal's nationalization, although he resented Nasser's decision to nationalize the holdings of top capitalists in Egypt in 1961.&lt;ref name="AhramPart1"/&gt;

In 1959, he married Nazimah Abdel-Hamid Ismail and the couple moved into a three-bedroom apartment in the Golf area of Heliopolis. The monthly rent was nine [[Egyptian pound|pounds]] (Salem's monthly salary was 18 pounds.) The couple's first child, Khaled, was born in 1961, followed by the birth of their daughter, Magda, two years later. According to one of his neighbors at the time, Salem did not own a car or many luxuries for most of the 1960s and early 1970s. He enrolled Khaled into Saint George, a private British school in Heliopolis, an education that Salem had to frequently borrow money to pay for.&lt;ref name="AhramPart1"/&gt;

==Career==

===Gamel Abdel Nasser era===

====Egyptian intelligence in Baghdad====
During the early 1960s Salem had landed a job as the branch director for the Arab Company for External Trade in [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]] which paid 43 pounds per month.&lt;ref name="AhramPart1" /&gt; A former CEO at the company—which was allegedly a front for the [[Egyptian General Intelligence Directorate|Egyptian Intelligence Services]]—remembered Salem as a very private employee who traveled abroad often. The CEO believes Salem was supervising arms deals to help nationalist struggles against [[European colonialism]] in [[North Africa]], in line with Nasser's foreign policy at the time.&lt;ref name="AhramPart1" /&gt;

In Casablanca Salem befriended [[Amin Howeidi]] who served as Egypt's ambassador to Morocco at the time. That same year, 1963, Howeidi was appointed ambassador to [[Iraq]] and he brought Salem with him to serve as the Arab Company's branch director in [[Baghdad]]. Salem began cultivating relationships with the high-ranking staff of the Egyptian embassy in Iraq, particularly Amin Yousri the embassy's press-attache and Ibrahim Yousri the embassy's second secretary. ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]'' editor Karem Yehia states that the Yousris claim Salem was a "likable" person, but not "intellectually sophisticated". Howeidi mentored Salem on international politics by enrolling him in study groups particularly after Howeidi was appointed by then-President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] to the post of Intelligence Director in 1967 following Egypt's defeat in the [[Six-Day War]] with [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="AhramYehia2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/14830/Egypt/Politics-/Hussein-Salem-A-businessman-from-the-times-of-cron.aspx|title=Hussein Salem: A businessman from the times of crony capitalism (part two)|work=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]|first=Karem|last=Yehia|date=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ibrahim Yousri, Salem gained Howeidi's trust primarily because he was able to regularly provide Howeidi with useful intelligence due to his connections with business circles in Iraq which would have otherwise been difficult to attain through the Egyptian embassy. Amin Yousri claims Salem cultivated good relationships with other Egyptian embassy employees by helping them buy Mercedes vehicles at low interest rates offered by the [[Iraqi Central Bank]]. Despite his relative success in Baghdad, Salem did not find his work there as particularly fulfilling and requested Howeidi a number of times for transfer to Europe where he said he had "friends" who could help him start a private business. Instead, Salem was sent on ambassadorial missions to [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]]. There he succeeded in establishing his own personal networks that would later become useful during his future business ventures in those states.&lt;ref name="AhramYehia2" /&gt;

Relations between Howeidi and Salem deteriorated following Nasser's death in 1970 and the succession of [[Anwar Sadat]] to the presidency afterward. Howeidi, an ardent supporter and symbol of Nasser's [[Arab socialism|socialist]] and [[Arab nationalist|nationalist]] struggles, was imprisoned by Sadat in 1971; Salem, uninterested in Nasser's ideals subsequently abandoned Howeidi, did not visit him in prison and ignored his wife's phone calls. Nonetheless, Salem lost his job in the Intelligence Directorate along with its perks. His half-brother Abdel Hamid later managed to secure Salem a job at Nasr Import and Export Company that same year by petitioning a senior official in Sadat's administration.&lt;ref name="AhramYehia2" /&gt;

===Anwar Sadat era===

====Business in Abu Dhabi====
Unhappy at the loss of the prestige and perks of his former intelligence job, Salem decided to move to [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) in 1972 where he became CEO of the Arab Emirates Trade Company, an importer of food supplies for UAE. He was set up there by former Egyptian economy minister Hassan Abbas Zaki, an economic adviser to the president of the UAE, Sheikh Zayed, at the time. Using his position, between 1972 and 1977 Salem reportedly developed extensive business relations in several Western countries, as well as [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. Through these contacts, he gained considerable wealth and began transferring large amounts of cash to [[Switzerland]] where he also purchased a number of hotels.&lt;ref name="AhramYehia2"/&gt;

Starting in 1977 Salem's financial situation began to improve considerably.&lt;ref name="AhramPart1"/&gt; Following then-Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]'s visit to Israel on 19 November 1977, the UAE downgraded relations with Egypt. Salem had still managed to maintain good relations with Emirati officials, but nonetheless left the UAE that same year. The primary reason behind Salem's departure was not linked to the political situation between the two countries, however. Instead he was said to have been forced out by some Emirati business families who claimed Salem's operations hurt them financially. According to Yehia, some sources say Salem fled hours before his company's headquarters were raided by auditing officials while other sources claim he was actually arrested and spent a number of days in an Emirati jail. Sayed Ali al-Shorafa, Grand High Chamberlain (Director)of the UAE's President's Court, Stated Salem was not charged with a crime and was subsequently pardoned by Sheikh Zayed. He also denied rumors that Salem had amassed $20 million in Abu Dhabi, stating "These are exaggerations ... We did not have anyone in the Emirates who had more than a million [[Dirham]]s at that time." Contrarily, Amin Yousri claimed that Salem had directly informed him that he acquired $200 million in the UAE which he transferred to his Swiss bank accounts. He would later relocate half of his money to [[Spain]], according to Yousri, where he gained Spanish citizenship and bought a mansion in [[Majorca]].&lt;ref name="AhramYehia2"/&gt;

====Return to Egypt and move to Washington, D.C.====
Salem returned to Egypt following his business ventures in the UAE. In addition to his history with the Egyptian government, he had established relations with highly influential figures in Egypt by appointing their sons or relatives to positions in his company in the UAE. In late 1977, not long after arriving in Egypt, he met [[Hosni Mubarak]] whom Sadat appointed Vice President in 1975. It was only in 1977 that things began to shape up for Salem. After returning to Egypt from a short assignment in the United Arab Emirates, he moved with his family from his Golf area apartment into a new unit in an apartment building he constructed in Saba Emarat area of Heliopolis. For two years Salem lived in his old apartment in [[Cairo]]'s affluent [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]] neighborhood. Although he was a millionaire by then, he took a job as an employee of the economy ministry, tasked with managing commercial deals. He reportedly kept his other business ventures private while working in the government. In 1979, Prime Minister [[Mustafa Khalil]] appointed him Commissioned Minister of Trade at the Egyptian embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name="AhramYehia2" /&gt;

That same year, Salem became CEO of the Egyptian American Transportation Company (ETSCO), established in [[Delaware]] with a branch in Cairo. On 9 October 1982, an article was published by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' entailing violations the company committed regarding various arms deals following the singing of the [[Camp David Accords]] in 1979. The arms deals involved using money from the [[Persian Gulf states]] to fund [[Mujahideen]] efforts against the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet occupation of Afghanistan]] and dictatorships in [[Latin America]]. Kamal Hassan Ali, the Egyptian minister of foreign affairs at the time, vehemently denied the allegations against ETSCO, calling them "wicked". He claimed the Egyptian government found no evidence of foul play on the part of the company during its year-long investigation of the incident. Ali went on to threaten to sue "anyone who dares to smear his name or any other Egyptian official" in American courts.&lt;ref name="AhramYehia3"&gt;Yehia, Karem. [http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/14894/Egypt/Politics-/Hussein-Salem-A-businessman-from-the-times-of-cron.aspx Hussein Salem: A businessman from the times of crony capitalism (part three)]. ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]''. 24 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ABC News]] ran a televised documentary in early March 2011 about what it described as corruption that was built in the Camp David Accords and American military aid to Egypt. The network highlighted what it called the role of [[Hosni Mubarak]], Mounir Thabet ([[Suzanne Mubarak]]'s brother) and the late Field Marshal Abu-Ghazalah in ETSCO’s illegal ventures. The aforementioned men received millions of dollars by maintaining an operation filled with illegal commissions, bribes and bidding violations. Salem paid an $8 million fine to [[The Pentagon]] in 1984 to settle the case. However, Amin Yousri would later discover through a memo sent from the Egyptian embassy to the Foreign Ministry in Cairo that Salem actually paid the Pentagon a much larger figure than was publicly announced. The memo mentioned that Salem's lawyers reached a $60 million settlement with the US government. A former partner in ETSCO who was also a [[CIA]] agent, Edwin Wilson, told ABC that Salem was a "front man" for Mubarak. According to anonymous employees&lt;ref name="AhramYehia3" /&gt;

===Hosni Mubarak era===

====Investment in Sinai tourism====
Sadat was assassinated in 1981 and was succeeded, later that year, by his vice president Hosni Mubarak who Salem had befriended and worked with in previous years. By 1987, the southern [[Sinai Peninsula]] experienced a boom in real estate investment, particularly in [[Sharm al-Sheikh]]. That year, Salem had commissioned the construction of a very large hotel called the Jolie Ville in that city. Suspicions were raised on Salem's acquisitions of property in Sinai since it was notably difficult for locals to acquire small parcels of land there and Salem had little background in construction. High-ranking officials, including Abdel Moneim Said, the governor-general of [[South Sinai Governorate|South Sinai]], and Hamid Khodeir, a local council member of the nearby city of [[el-Tor]], claim Salem gained contracts for the land along the southern Sinai coast due to his close friendships with Mubarak and his son [[Gamal Mubarak|Gamal]]. From 1987 until the early 21st-century, Salem had established tourism empire in Sinai, owning several hotels. Major expansions to his business operations in Sinai included a mass conference hall, a golf course, a luxurious mosque for Mubarak's personal use, and numerous palaces, one of which he sold to Mubarak. In 1997, the Jolie Ville hosted a large conference sponsoring peace in the Middle East related to the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].&lt;ref name="AhramYehia4"&gt;Yehia, Karem. [http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/14938/Egypt/Politics-/Hussein-Salem-A-businessman-from-the-times-of-cron.aspx Hussein Salem: A businessman from the times of crony capitalism (part four)]. ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]''. 31 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The local Bedouins who lived along the southern Sinai coast privately criticized Salem for ignoring their community by not building any projects in the local areas. Members of the el-Tor local council complained that his operations further marginalized the Bedouins by not contributing to their welfare, increasing their sense of marginalization. Abdel-Moneim Said agreed, stating "Salem did not contribute anything that benefited ordinary people in the governorate." In 2002, Said claimed that after the local government constructed a strip-like "Walk" adjacent to the Jolie Ville Hotel intended for locals to open business along, Mubarak ordered the governor to hand it over to Salem.&lt;ref name="AhramYehia4" /&gt;

====Egyptian–Israeli gas deals====
In 1993, following the [[1993 Oslo Peace Accords between Palestinians and Israel|1993 Oslo Agreements]] between the Israelis and [[Palestinian territories|Palestinians]] which Mubarak helped broker, Israel and Egypt began work on a gas pipeline to supply the former with [[natural gas]] and to build a petroleum refinery in Sinai, the first privately owned refinery in the Arab Middle East. Mubarak awarded Salem licenses to work on both projects. Salem's relations with Israeli business circles dates back to the 1970s during his tenure at the Washington D.C. embassy, including when the Israelis and Egyptians were negotiating Camp David. In 1996, Salem sold most of his shares in the new refinery company, Midor, and made a substantial profit. In 2007, he sold most of his shares in the [[East Mediterranean Gas Company]], a year before the pipeline actually pumped any gas. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Israel gained 40% of its gas needs from below-market price Egyptian gas exports. The Israeli newspaper ''[[Yediot Aharonoth]]'' described Salem as the "number one man" of the normalization process between the two states.&lt;ref name="AhramYehia5"&gt;Yehia, Karem.

In exchange, prosecutors allege that Salem gave Mubarak and his family five luxury villas worth about $4.5 million, including a 161,000-square-foot seaside estate in [[Sharm el-Sheikh]].&lt;ref name="NYT 6/2011" /&gt; Following his arrest, Spanish judges set his bail at €27 million (approximately $33 million), €12 million for the Spanish charges and €15 million for the Egyptian charges.&lt;ref name="BBC 03/2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17239494|title=Spanish court orders extradition of Mubarak associate|newspaper=BBC News|date=2 March 2012|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial in Egypt and extradition fight===

Spain demanded assurances from Egyptian authorities that in exchange for the defendants extradition the two would be heard in front of new juries than the ones currently in trial since the previous August and that the men would have the choice to return to Spain to serve their sentences.&lt;ref name="NYT 03/2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/03/world/europe/spain-court-orders-mubarak-associate-to-face-corruption-charges-in-egypt.html?_r=0|title=Spain: Court Orders Mubarak Associate to Face Corruption Charges in Egypt|newspaper=New York Times|date=3 March 2012|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in June 2012, the Cairo Criminal Court found Salem, in absentia, and former [[Ministry of Petroleum (Egypt)|Petroleum Minister]] [[Sameh Fahmi]] guilty and sentenced them each to 15 years in prison.&lt;ref name="EI 11/2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/following-gas-deal-verdict-hussein-salem-return-egypt|title=Following gas-deal verdict, Hussein Salem to return to Egypt|newspaper=Egypt Independent|date=29 November 2014|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jerome Bernard Orbach''' (October 20, 1935 – December 28, 2004) was an American actor and singer, described at the time of his death as "one of the last'' bona fide'' leading men of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical and global celebrity on television"&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite web|last=Brantley|first=Ben|title=Jerry Orbach, Star of 'Law &amp; Order', Dies at 69|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/29/arts/29cnd-orba.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 12, 2013|author2=Severo, Richard|date=December 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "versatile stage and film actor".&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|date=December 30, 2004|title='Law &amp; Order' Star Jerry Orbach Dies at 69|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33356-2004Dec29.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbach's professional career began on the [[New York City|New York]] stage, both on and [[off-Broadway]], where he created roles such as El Gallo in the original off-Broadway run of ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' (1960) and became the first performer to sing that show's standard "[[Try To Remember]]";&lt;ref name=Gilvey&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilvey|first=John Anthony|date=May 1, 2011|title=Jerry Orbach: Prince of the City - His Way From The Fantastiks to Law &amp; Order|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kCGxXNWdZmAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=gilvey+law+and+order&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSjpKYgKnQAhUKPCYKHRxHDh4Q6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gilvey%20law%20and%20order&amp;f=false|publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books|location=Milwaukee, Wisc.|isbn=978-1-42348-845-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billy Flynn in the original ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' (1975–1977), and Julian Marsh in the original ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]'' (1980–1985).

Orbach was born on October 20, 1935, in [[the Bronx]], the only child of Emily (née Olexy), a greeting card manufacturer and radio singer, and Leon Orbach, a restaurant manager and [[vaudeville]] performer.&lt;ref name=biog&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerry Orbach – Biography|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/45/Jerry-Orbach.html|website=filmreference.com |publisher=Advameg|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a [[History of the Jews in Hamburg|Jewish]] emigrant from [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]].

Orbach left Northwestern before his senior year and moved to [[New York City]] in 1955 to pursue acting and to study at the [[Actors Studio]], where one of his instructors was the studio's founder, [[Lee Strasberg]].&lt;ref name="biography.com" /&gt;

==Career==

Orbach was an accomplished [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and off-Broadway actor. His first major role was El Gallo in the original 1960 cast of the decades-running hit ''[[The Fantasticks]],'' and Orbach became the first to perform the show's signature song and pop standard "[[Try To Remember]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|title=Jerry Orbach, 69; Actor Portrayed Det. Briscoe on TV's "Law &amp; Order"|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/30/local/me-orbach30|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 30, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also starred in ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', ''[[Carnival!]]'', the musical version of the movie ''[[Lili]]'' (his Broadway debut), in a revival of ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (as Sky Masterson, receiving a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical), ''[[Promises, Promises (musical)|Promises, Promises]]'' (as Chuck Baxter, winning a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical), the original productions of ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' (as Billy Flynn, receiving another Tony Award nomination), ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]'', and a revival of ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''. Orbach made occasional film and TV appearances into the 1970s and appeared as a celebrity panelist on both ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[Super Password]]''.

In the 1980s, Orbach shifted to film and TV work full-time. Prominent roles included a superb performance as tough, effective, but "allegedly corrupt" NYPD narcotics detective Gus Levy in [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''[[Prince of the City (film)|Prince of the City]]''; he was the 1981 runner-up for the [[National Society of Film Critics|NSFC]] Best Supporting Actor award. He also portrayed gangsters in both the action-thriller ''[[F/X]]'' and the [[Woody Allen]] drama ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' (the latter of which also featured his future ''Law &amp; Order'' co-star [[Sam Waterston]]). In 1985, Orbach became a regular guest star on ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' as private detective Harry McGraw, which led to him starring in the short-lived spin-off series ''[[The Law &amp; Harry McGraw]]''. In 1987, he was featured in the hit film ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' as Dr. Jake Houseman, the father of [[Jennifer Grey]]'s character "Baby". He made further TV appearances on popular shows such as ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' (for which he received his first [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nomination&lt;ref name=Gilvey/&gt;), ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'', and ''[[Frasier]]'' (as a guest caller).

In 1991, Orbach starred in Disney's [[Academy Award]]-winning animated musical ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', as the [[Voice acting|voice]] (both singing and speaking) of the French-accented [[Candelabra|candelabrum]] Lumière, which according to Orbach, he played "halfway between [[Maurice Chevalier]] and [[Pepé Le Pew]]".&lt;ref name=Gilvey/&gt; At the [[64th Academy Awards]], Orbach performed a live-action stage rendition of the Oscar-nominated song, "[[Be Our Guest]]", that he sang in ''Beauty and the Beast''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hollywood.com/tv/55363044/the-64th-annual-academy-awards|title = The 64th Annual Academy Awards|website = Hollywood.com|accessdate = April 22, 2014|publisher = Hollywood.com, L.L.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/54172/Jerry-Orbach/filmography|title=Jerry Orbach — Filmography|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt; He later reprised his voice role of Lumière for the film's direct-to-video sequels, multiple episodes of ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', and the previously-deleted song ("[[Human Again (Beauty and the Beast)|Human Again]]") that was added to the ''Beauty and the Beast'' 2002 [[IMAX]] re-release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zOzpwaDTR2wC&amp;pg=PA501&amp;dq=Human+Again+%28Beauty+and+the+Beast%29+-%22lyrics%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Human%20Again%20%28Beauty%20and%20the%20Beast%29%20-%22lyrics%22&amp;f=false|title=Walt's People: Talking Disney with the Artists Who Knew Him|isbn=9781450087476|author1=Ghez|first1=Didier|date=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tracy|first1=Joe|title=Digital Media FX Review of  Beauty and the Beast Special Edition (IMAX)|url=http://www.digitalmediafx.com/Beauty/beauty-beast-review.html|website=digitalmediafx.com|publisher=Digital Media FX Review of  Beauty and the Beast Special Edition|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Orbach joined the main ensemble cast of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' as the world-weary, wisecracking, streetwise NYPD homicide detective [[Lennie Briscoe]]. He had previously guest-starred as a defense attorney on the series, and was subsequently cast as the new "senior detective" following [[Paul Sorvino]]'s departure.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; Orbach's portrayal of Detective Briscoe was based on his similar role from ''Prince of the City'' years before, which ''Law &amp; Order'' creator [[Dick Wolf]] had personally suggested to him at the time of his casting.&lt;ref name=Gilvey/&gt;

Orbach starred on ''Law &amp; Order'' for 12 years, ultimately becoming the third longest-serving main cast member (behind [[S. Epatha Merkerson]] and [[Sam Waterston]]) in the show's 20-year-run history, as well as one of its most popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/06/1096949578141.html Missing You Already, Punk.] Sydney Morning Herald. October 7, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; During Orbach's tenure on ''Law &amp; Order'', the series won the 1997 [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series]] among other accolades, made multiple crossover episodes with fellow [[NBC]] series ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', and spawned a franchise that included the TV film ''[[Exiled: A Law &amp; Order Movie]]'', the spin-off series ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' and ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' (both of which featured Orbach in guest appearances), and three video games. Orbach himself was nominated for a 2000 [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]] (losing to [[James Gandolfini]] for ''[[The Sopranos]]''). ''[[TV Guide]]'' named Lennie Briscoe one of their top-25 greatest television detectives of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide Book of Lists|year=2007|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-3007-9|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during his time on ''Law &amp; Order'', Orbach co-starred with [[Al Pacino]] in the [[independent film]] ''[[Chinese Coffee]]'', which was filmed in the summer of 1997 and released three years later.&lt;ref name=Gilvey/&gt;

==Personal life==
Orbach was married in 1958 to Marta Curro, with whom he had two sons, Anthony Nicholas and [[Chris Orbach|Christopher Benjamin]]; they [[divorce]]d in 1975. Elder son Tony is a [[crossword puzzle]] constructor for ''[[The New York Times]]'' and also guest starred in the ''Law &amp; Order'' episode "Doubles" as a reporter. Younger son [[Chris Orbach]], who is an actor and singer, played Lennie Briscoe's nephew Ken Briscoe during the first season of ''Special Victims Unit''. In 1979, Jerry Orbach married Broadway dancer [[Elaine Cancilla]], whom he met while starring in ''Chicago''.

Orbach lived in a high-rise on [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Street]] off [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] and was a fixture in that neighborhood's restaurants and shops.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; His glossy publicity photo hangs in Ms. Buffy's French Cleaners, and he was a regular at some of the Italian restaurants nearby. As of 2007, the intersection of 8th Avenue and 53rd Street was renamed in honor of Orbach. The plans met with some resistance by local planning boards, but were overcome thanks to his popularity and his love of the [[Big Apple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGeehan|first1=Patrick|title=Jerry Orbach Was a Marquee Name, but a Street Sign’s Another Story|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/07/nyregion/07rename.html?ex=1188882000&amp;en=9c069054d6276ca5&amp;ei=5087&amp;excamp=OVGNjerryOrbach|accessdate=14 November 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 7, 2007|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==
In January 1994, less than two years into his stint on ''Law &amp; Order'', Orbach was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name=Gilvey/&gt; He initially received [[radiation therapy]] as treatment, but by December 1994, the cancer had returned and [[Metastasis|metastasized]]. At that point, he went on [[hormone therapy]], on which he remained over the next decade until the treatment ran out{{clarification needed|date=April 2018}} in March 2004.&lt;ref name=Gilvey/&gt; Following his departure from ''Law &amp; Order'' that year, Orbach went through [[chemotherapy]], but he ultimately succumbed to his cancer on December 28, 2004, at the [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] in New York at age 69.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt; Despite being diagnosed with the cancer more than a decade before his death, Orbach's illness was not revealed to the general public until just weeks before he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silverman|first1=Stephen M.|title=Jerry Orbach Battling Prostate Cancer|url=http://people.com/celebrity/jerry-orbach-battling-prostate-cancer/|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=People|publisher=Time|date=December 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his death, Orbach was signed to continue in the role of Lennie Briscoe on the new spin-off ''[[Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury]]'', which was to accommodate his illness by giving him a lighter schedule than he had had on the original series, but he was only featured in the first two episodes, both of which aired following his death.&lt;ref name=Gilvey/&gt;

The day after Orbach's death, the marquees on Broadway were dimmed in mourning, one of the highest honors of the American theatre world,&lt;ref name=Gilvey/&gt; while NBC re-aired the ''Law &amp; Order'' episode  "[[C.O.D. (Law &amp; Order)|C.O.D.]]" (the last episode of the original series to feature Orbach) in honor of him. The ''Criminal Intent'' episode "View from Up Here" and the ''Trial by Jury'' episode "Baby Boom"&lt;ref name=Gilvey/&gt; were dedicated to Orbach, and the ''Law &amp; Order'' episode "Mammon" featured a pictorial memorial of him.

In addition to his sons, wife, and former wife, Orbach was survived by his mother and two grandchildren, Peter and Sarah Kate Orbach, children of his older son Tony. His mother died on July 28, 2012, at the age of 101.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?pid=159009703 Obituary for Emily Orbach], ''The New York Times''; accessed January 16, 2014 at legacy.com archive online.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Elaine died in 2009 at age 69, and his former wife Marta died in 2012 at age 79. Having had perfect 20/20 vision his whole life, Jerry Orbach requested that his eyes be donated after his death.&lt;ref name=Gilvey/&gt; His wish was granted when two individuals – one who needed correction for a nearsighted eye and another who needed correction for a farsighted eye – received Orbach's [[cornea]]s. His likeness has been used in an ad campaign for Eye Bank for Sight Restoration in Manhattan. The interment of his remains was at [[Trinity Church Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=Gilvey/&gt;

==Honors==
In addition to his Tony Award and nominations, Jerry Orbach is also a member of the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]], having been inducted in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/magazine/19991117rawson5.asp|title=On Stage: New Class of Theater Hall of Famers|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Orbach was named a "Living Landmark" by the [[New York Landmarks Conservancy]], along with his ''Law &amp; Order'' co-star Sam Waterston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Living Landmarks Celebration - Living Landmarks Honoree List|url=http://www.nylandmarks.org/events/living_landmarks_gala/honoree_list/|website=nylandmarks.org|publisher=[[New York Landmarks Conservancy]]|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orbach quipped that the honor meant "that they can't tear me down."&lt;ref name="Living Landmark"/&gt;

On February 5, 2005, he was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded a [[11th Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]] for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series]] for his longtime role on ''Law &amp; Order''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release — Screen Actors Guild Honors Outstanding Film and Television Performances in 13 Categories at the 11th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards|url=http://sagawards.org/media-pr/press-releases/screen-actors-guild-honors-outstanding-film-and-television-performances-13--0|website=sagawards.org/|publisher=Screen Actors Guild|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Elaine accepted the award on his behalf.

On September 18, 2007, a portion of New York City's 53rd Street near Eighth Avenue was renamed 'Jerry Orbach Way' in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGeehan|first1=Patrick|title=Manhattan: Street Naming|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/nyregion/18mbrfs-ORBACH.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|accessdate=14 November 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 18, 2007|page=B8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, the Jerry Orbach Theatre was named for him in the [[The Theater Center|Snapple Theater Center]] at 50th Street and Broadway in New York City. The naming occurred as a tribute to him during a revival of ''The Fantasticks'' at the theatre.

===From others===
After ''Law &amp; Order'' was cancelled in 2010, executive producer [[René Balcer]] was quoted by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'': "I always think about the show as before Jerry and after Jerry... You saw the weariness of 25 years of crime-fighting in New York written on his face."&lt;ref&gt;Chosick, Amy and Gamerman, Ellen.[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703691804575254843296805922?mod=WSJ_business_LeftSecondHighlights "'Law &amp; Order' School of Drama"]. ''The Wall Street Journal''. May 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Kurt Vonnegut]] was a fan of Orbach, and during an Australian radio interview in 2005, he said, "People have asked me, you know, 'Who would you rather be, than yourself?'," and he replied "Jerry Orbach, without a question... I talked to him one time, and he's adorable."&lt;ref&gt;October 6, 2005. Kurt Vonnegut interviewed on ABC Radio National Audio by Phillip Adams. Available on the ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' Region 4 DVD, released by [[Umbrella Entertainment]] Pty Ltd in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

''New York Times'' writers Ben Brantley and Richard Servero analyzed the breadth and scope of Orbach's career:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether singing "Try to Remember" as the dashing narrator of "The Fantasticks" in 1960 or trading barbs with fellow detectives and reluctant witnesses on television in recent years, Mr. Orbach exuded a wry, ragged masculinity that was all his own. As a star of musicals, he created a new kind of hero who was leagues away from suave, swaggering Adonises like [[John Raitt]], [[Howard Keel]], and [[Alfred Drake]]... And he flourished at a time when the Broadway musical hero was fast becoming an endangered species... His rough-edged individuality may account for his endurance on the Broadway stage in an era when other promising musical actors - including [[Larry Kert]], [[Robert Goulet]], and [[Robert Morse]] - proved unable to follow through on their breakthrough successes. Mr. Orbach may have been the last of a breed: no male star since has matched the breadth and continuity of his career in musicals... It wasn't until the 1990s, when he started appearing as Lennie Briscoe in "Law &amp; Order," that Mr. Orbach became a familiar name throughout the country. The rough edge that distinguished him on Broadway eased his transition to character roles like Briscoe, the recovered alcoholic who seemed to greet the discovery of each episode's crime with a world-weary shrug.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Dirty Dancing'' co-star [[Patrick Swayze]] memorialized Orbach after his death:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jerry Orbach has been one of the most successful actors who ever lived to make that transition from musical theatre into real, organic, break-your-heart kinds of reality in his work as a film actor, but transition back and forth seamlessly... it was a very interesting time for me, when I was shooting ''Dirty Dancing'', I think probably the eyes I trusted if I was real, and it worked, and I had nailed it, [were] Jerry Orbach's eyes. I would go over to him and under my breath "What did you think?" and he goes "No, go there further, I think there's more you can get." He would say little things like "courage", and it gives me goosebumps to say that. I really, really respected that man. I watched his career from the time I was little. I think it was a great loss when he passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|last=You Tube video|work=[[American Film Institute]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQlzKrqe6g|title=Patrick Swayze Talks About Working With Jerry Orbach}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of Steinbeck's work is set in [[central California]], particularly in the [[Salinas Valley]] and the [[California Coast Ranges]] region. His works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice, especially as applied to downtrodden or [[everyman]] [[protagonists]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;.

==Early life==

Steinbeck was born on February 27, 1902, in [[Salinas, California]].&lt;ref name="jsbae"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/john-steinbeck-9493358|title=John Steinbeck Biography|date=February 6, 2018|work=[[Biography.com]] website|publisher=[[A&amp;E Television Networks]]|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was of [[German-American|German]], [[English-American|English]], and [[Irish-American|Irish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irishamerica.com/2007/06/okie-faces-irish-eyes-john-steinbeck-route-66/ |title=Okie Faces &amp; Irish Eyes: John Steinbeck &amp; Route 66 |publisher=Irish America |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121232922/http://irishamerica.com/2007/06/okie-faces-irish-eyes-john-steinbeck-route-66/ |archivedate=November 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johann Adolf Großsteinbeck (1828–1913), Steinbeck's paternal grandfather, shortened the family name to Steinbeck when he immigrated to the United States. The family farm in [[Heiligenhaus]], [[Mettmann (district)|Mettmann]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany, is still named "Großsteinbeck."

His father, John Ernst Steinbeck (1862–1935), served as [[Monterey County]] treasurer. John's mother, Olive Hamilton (1867–1934), a former school teacher, shared Steinbeck's passion for reading and writing.&lt;ref name="NSC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steinbeck.org/Bio.html |title=John Steinbeck Biography |accessdate=April 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305004150/http://www.steinbeck.org/Bio.html |archivedate=March 5, 2010 |df= }}.

There he learned of the harsher aspects of the migrant life and the darker side of human nature, which supplied him with material expressed in such works as ''[[Of Mice and Men]]''.&lt;ref name="Biography" /&gt; He explored his surroundings, walking across local forests, fields, and farms.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;Introduction to John Steinbeck, ''The Long Valley'', pp. 9–10, John Timmerman, Penguin Publishing, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; While working at Spreckels Sugar Company, he sometimes worked in their laboratory, which gave him time to write.&lt;ref name="Benson"&gt;Jackson J. Benson, ''The True Adventures of John Steinbeck, Writer'' New York: The Viking Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-14-014417-X}}, pp. 147, 915a, 915b, 133&lt;/ref&gt; He had considerable mechanical aptitude and fondness for repairing things he owned.&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt;

[[File:SteinbeckHouse.jpg|thumb|The [[John Steinbeck House (Salinas, California)|Steinbeck House]] at 132 Central Avenue, [[Salinas, California]], the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] home where Steinbeck spent his childhood.]]
Steinbeck graduated from Salinas High School in 1919 and went on to study English Literature at [[Stanford University]] near [[Palo Alto]], leaving without a degree in 1925. He traveled to New York City where he took odd jobs while trying to write. When he failed to publish his work, he returned to California and worked in 1928 as a tour guide and caretaker&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt; at [[Lake Tahoe]], where he met Carol Henning, his first wife.&lt;ref name="NSC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to 'The Grapes of Wrath' Penguin edition (1192) by Robert DeMott&lt;/ref&gt; They married in January 1930 in Los Angeles, where, with friends, he attempted to make money by manufacturing plaster [[mannequins]].&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt;

When their money ran out six months later due to a slow market, Steinbeck and Carol moved back to [[Pacific Grove, California]], to a cottage owned by his father, on the [[Monterey Peninsula]] a few blocks outside the [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] city limits. The elder Steinbecks gave John free housing,  paper for his manuscripts, and from 1928,  loans that allowed him to write without looking for work. During the [[Great Depression]], Steinbeck bought a small boat, and later claimed that he was able to live on the fish and crab that he gathered from the sea, and fresh vegetables from his garden and local farms. When those sources failed, Steinbeck and his wife accepted welfare, and on rare occasions, stole bacon from the local produce market.&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt; Whatever food they had, they shared with their friends.&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt; Carol became the model for Mary Talbot in Steinbeck's novel [[Cannery Row (novel)|''Cannery Row'']].&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt;

In 1930, Steinbeck met the marine biologist [[Ed Ricketts]], who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology.&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt; Ricketts, usually very quiet, yet likable, with an inner self-sufficiency and an encyclopedic knowledge of diverse subjects, became a focus of Steinbeck's attention. Ricketts had taken a college class from [[Warder Clyde Allee]], a biologist and ecological theorist, who would go on to write a classic early textbook on [[ecology]]. Ricketts became a proponent of ecological thinking, in which man was only one part of a great chain of being, caught in a web of life too large for him to control or understand.&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt; Meanwhile, Ricketts operated a biological lab on the coast of Monterey, selling biological samples of small animals, fish, rays, starfish, turtles, and other marine forms to schools and colleges.

Between 1930 and 1936, Steinbeck and Ricketts became close friends. Steinbeck's wife began working at the lab as secretary-bookkeeper.&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt; Steinbeck helped on an informal basis.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson J. Benson, ''The True Adventures of John Steinbeck, Writer'' New York: The Viking Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-14-014417-X}}, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; They formed a common bond based on their love of music and art, and John learned biology and Ricketts' ecological philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson J. Benson, ''The True Adventures of John Steinbeck, Writer'' New York: The Viking Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-14-014417-X}}, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; When Steinbeck became emotionally upset, Ricketts sometimes played music for him.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson J.

==Career==

===Writing===
Steinbeck's first novel, ''[[Cup of Gold: A Life of Sir Henry Morgan, Buccaneer, With Occasional Reference to History|Cup of Gold]]'', published in 1929, is loosely based on the life and death of [[privateer]] [[Henry Morgan]]. It centers on Morgan's assault and sacking of the city of [[Panama]], sometimes referred to as the 'Cup of Gold', and on the women, fairer than the sun, who were said to be found there.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

Between 1930 and 1933, Steinbeck produced three shorter works. ''[[The Pastures of Heaven]]'', published in 1932, consists of twelve interconnected stories about a valley near Monterey, which was discovered by a Spanish [[corporal]] while chasing runaway [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] slaves. In 1933 Steinbeck published ''[[The Red Pony]]'', a 100-page, four-chapter story weaving in memories of Steinbeck's childhood.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; ''[[To a God Unknown]]'', named after a [[Vedic]] hymn,&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt; follows the life of a [[Homestead Act|homesteader]] and his family in California, depicting a character with a primal and pagan worship of the land he works. Although he had not achieved the status of a well-known writer, he never doubted that he would achieve greatness.&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt;

Steinbeck achieved his first critical success with ''[[Tortilla Flat]]'' (1935), a novel set in post-war Monterey, California, that won the California [[Commonwealth Club of California|Commonwealth Club]]'s Gold Medal.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; It portrays the adventures of a group of classless and usually homeless young men in Monterey after [[World War I]], just before U.S. [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. They are portrayed in ironic comparison to mythic knights on a quest and reject nearly all the standard mores of American society in enjoyment of a dissolute life devoted to wine, lust, camaraderie and petty theft. In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to Steinbeck, the Swedish Academy cited "spicy and comic tales about a gang of ''paisanos'', asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of [[Round Table|King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table]]. It has been said that in the United States this book came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing depression."&lt;ref name=nobel/&gt;
''Tortilla Flat'' was adapted as a [[Tortilla Flat (film)|1942 film of the same name]], starring [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[John Garfield]], a friend of Steinbeck. With some of the proceeds, he built a summer ranch-home in [[Los Gatos]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Steinbeck began to write a series of "California novels" and [[Dust Bowl]] fiction, set among common people during the [[Great Depression]]. These included ''[[In Dubious Battle]]'', ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' and ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. He also wrote an article series called ''[[The Harvest Gypsies]]'' for the ''San Francisco News'' about the plight of the migrant worker.

''Of Mice and Men'' was a [[drama]] about the dreams of two migrant agricultural laborers in California. It was critically acclaimed&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; and Steinbeck's 1962 Nobel Prize citation called it a "little masterpiece".&lt;ref name=nobel/&gt;
Its stage production was a hit, starring [[Wallace Ford]] as George and [[Broderick Crawford]] as George's companion, the mentally childlike, but physically powerful itinerant farmhand Lennie. Steinbeck refused to travel from his home in California to attend any performance of the play during its New York run, telling director [[George S. Kaufman]] that the play as it existed in his own mind was "perfect" and that anything presented on stage would only be a disappointment. Steinbeck wrote two more stage plays (''[[The Moon Is Down]]'' and ''[[Burning Bright]]'').

''Of Mice and Men'' was also adapted as a [[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|1939 Hollywood film]], with [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] as Lennie (he had filled the role in the Los Angeles stage production) and [[Burgess Meredith]] as George.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031742/ |title=Of Mice and Men (1939) |publisher=The Internet Movie Database |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030200117/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031742/ |archivedate=October 30, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meredith and Steinbeck became close friends for the next two decades.&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt; Another film based on the novella was made in 1992 starring Gary Sinise as George and John Malkovich as Lennie.

Steinbeck followed this wave of success with ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco. It is commonly considered his greatest work. According to ''The New York Times'', it was the best-selling book of 1939 and 430,000 copies had been printed by February 1940. In that month, it won the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]], favorite fiction book of 1939, voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]].&lt;ref name=nyt1940&gt;"1939 Book Awards Given by Critics: Elgin Groseclose's 'Ararat' is Picked as Work Which Failed to Get Due Recognition", ''The New York Times'', February 14, 1940, p. 25.

''Grapes'' was controversial. Steinbeck's [[New Deal]] political views, negative portrayal of aspects of capitalism, and sympathy for the plight of workers, led to a backlash against the author, especially close to home.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Windschuttle (June 2, 2002). {{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/20/jun02/steinbeck.htm |title="Steinbeck's myth of the Okies" |accessdate=August 10, 2005 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040204193303/http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/20/jun02/steinbeck.htm |archivedate=February 4, 2004 |df= }}.

Of the controversy, Steinbeck wrote, "The vilification of me out here from the large landowners and bankers is pretty bad. The latest is a rumor started by them that the [[Okie]]s hate me and have threatened to kill me for lying about them. I'm frightened at the rolling might&lt;!-- OK here: don't correct it --&gt; of this damned thing.

The film versions of ''The Grapes of Wrath'' and ''Of Mice and Men'' (by two different movie studios) were in production simultaneously, allowing Steinbeck to spend a full day on the set of ''The Grapes of Wrath'' and the next day on the set of ''Of Mice and Men.''{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Ed Ricketts===
In the 1930s and 1940s, [[Ed Ricketts]] strongly influenced Steinbeck's writing. Steinbeck frequently took small trips with Ricketts along the California coast to give himself time off from his writing&lt;ref name="Journey" /&gt; and to collect biological specimens, which Ricketts sold for a living. Their joint book about a collecting expedition to the [[Gulf of California]] in 1940, which was part travelogue and part natural history, published just as the U.S. entered World War II, never found an audience and did not sell well.&lt;ref name="Journey"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Journey into Steinbeck's California|author=Susan Shillinglaw|publisher=Roaring Forties Press|year=2006|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1951, Steinbeck republished the narrative portion of the book as ''[[The Log from the Sea of Cortez]]'', under his name only (though Ricketts had written some of it). This work remains in print today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaofcortez.org/ A website devoted to Sea of Cortez literature, with information on Steinbeck's expedition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720104329/http://www.seaofcortez.org/ |date=July 20, 2009 }} Retrieved July 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Carol accompanied Steinbeck on the trip, their marriage was beginning to suffer, and ended a year later, in 1941, even as Steinbeck worked on the manuscript for the book.&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt; In 1942, after his divorce from Carol he married Gwyndolyn "Gwyn" Conger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fensch|first=Thomas|title=Steinbeck and Covici |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yXE_v1etBjMC&amp;pg=PA33|series=New Century exceptional lives|year=2002|publisher=New Century Books|isbn= 978-0-930751-35-7|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his second wife Steinbeck had two sons, [[Thomas Steinbeck|Thomas ("Thom") Myles Steinbeck]] (1944–2016) and [[John Steinbeck IV]] (1946–1991).

Ricketts was Steinbeck's model for the character of "Doc" in ''[[Cannery Row (novel)|Cannery Row]]'' (1945) and ''[[Sweet Thursday]]'' (1954), "Friend Ed" in ''[[Burning Bright]]'', and characters in ''[[In Dubious Battle]]'' (1936) and ''The Grapes of Wrath'' (1939). Ecological themes recur in Steinbeck's novels of the period.&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;Bruce Robison, "Mavericks on Cannery Row," ''[[American Scientist]]'', vol. 92, no. 6 (November–December 2004), p. 1: a review of Eric Enno Tamm, [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/mavericks-on-cannery-row ''Beyond the Outer Shores: The Untold Odyssey of Ed Ricketts, the Pioneering Ecologist who Inspired John Steinbeck and Joseph Campbell''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604181032/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/mavericks-on-cannery-row |date=June 4, 2009 }}, Four Walls Eight Windows, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinbeck's close relations with Ricketts ended in 1941 when Steinbeck moved away from Pacific Grove and divorced his wife Carol.&lt;ref name="Journey"/&gt; Ricketts' biographer Eric Enno Tamm notes that, except for ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'' (1952), Steinbeck's writing declined after Ricketts' untimely death in 1948.&lt;ref name=bruce/&gt;

===1940s–1960s work===
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}
Steinbeck's novel ''[[The Moon Is Down]]'' (1942), about the [[Socrates]]-inspired spirit of resistance in an occupied village in [[Northern Europe]], was made into a film almost immediately. It was presumed that the unnamed country of the novel was Norway and [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|the occupiers]] the Nazis. In 1945, Steinbeck received the [[King Haakon VII Freedom Cross]] for his literary contributions to the [[Norwegian resistance movement]].

In 1943, Steinbeck served as a World War II [[war correspondent]] for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and worked with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (predecessor of the CIA).&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''The Moon Is Down'' (Penguin) published 1995, by Donald V. Coers&lt;/ref&gt; It was at that time he became friends with [[Will Lang, Jr.]] of ''Time''/''Life'' magazine. During the war, Steinbeck accompanied the commando raids of [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]]'s [[Beach Jumpers]] program, which launched small-unit diversion operations against German-held islands in the [[Mediterranean]]. At one point, he accompanied Fairbanks on an invasion of an island off the coast of Italy and helped capture Italian and German prisoners, using a Tommy Gun. Some of his writings from this period were incorporated in the documentary ''[[Once There Was a War]]'' (1958).

Steinbeck returned from the war with a number of wounds from [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and some psychological trauma. He treated himself, as ever, by writing. He wrote [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s movie, ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944), and the film, ''[[A Medal for Benny]]'' (1945), with screenwriter [[Jack Wagner (screenwriter)|Jack Wagner]] about [[Compadre|paisanos]] from ''[[Tortilla Flat]]'' going to war. He later requested that his name be removed from the credits of ''Lifeboat,'' because he believed the final version of the film had racist undertones. In 1944, suffering from homesickness for his Pacific Grove/Monterey life of the 1930s, he wrote ''[[Cannery Row]]'' (1945), which became so famous that in 1958 Ocean View Avenue in [[Monterey]], the location of the book, was renamed Cannery Row.

After the war, he wrote ''[[The Pearl (novel)|The Pearl]]'' (1947), knowing it would be filmed eventually. The story first appeared in the December 1945 issue of [[Woman's Home Companion]] magazine as "The Pearl of the World." It was illustrated by [[John Alan Maxwell]]. The novel is an imaginative telling of a story which Steinbeck had heard in La Paz in 1940, as related in ''The Log From the Sea of Cortez'', which he described in Chapter 11 as being "so much like a parable that it almost can't be".&lt;!--the citation is The Log From the Sea of Cortez, see chapter 11--&gt; Steinbeck traveled to Mexico for the filming with Wagner who helped with the script; on this trip he would be inspired by the story of [[Emiliano Zapata]], and subsequently wrote a film script (''[[Viva Zapata!]]'') directed by [[Elia Kazan]] and starring [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Anthony Quinn]].

In 1947, Steinbeck made the first of many{{how many|date=October 2018}} trips to the [[Soviet Union]], this one with photographer [[Robert Capa]]. They visited [[Moscow]], [[Kiev]], [[Tbilisi]], [[Batumi]] and [[Stalingrad]], some of the first Americans to visit many parts of the USSR since the [[communist revolution]]. Steinbeck's 1948 book about their experiences, ''[[A Russian Journal]]'', was illustrated with Capa's photos. In 1948, the year the book was published, Steinbeck was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].

In 1952 Steinbeck's longest novel, ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', was published. According to his third wife, Elaine, he considered it his ''magnum opus'', his greatest novel.

In 1952, John Steinbeck appeared as the on-screen narrator of [[20th Century Fox]]'s film, ''[[O. Henry's Full House]]''. Although Steinbeck later admitted he was uncomfortable before the camera, he provided interesting introductions to several filmed adaptations of short stories by the legendary writer [[O. Henry]]. About the same time, Steinbeck recorded readings of several of his short stories for [[Columbia Records]];  the recordings provide a record of Steinbeck's deep, resonant voice.

Following the success of ''Viva Zapata!'', Steinbeck collaborated with Kazan on ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'', [[James Dean]]'s film debut.

[[File:TravelswithCharlieVehicle.jpg|thumb|[[Rocinante]], camper truck in which Steinbeck traveled across the United States in 1960]]
''[[Travels with Charley: In Search of America]]'' is a travelogue of his 1960 [[road trip]] with his [[poodle]] Charley. Steinbeck bemoans his lost youth and roots, while dispensing both criticism and praise for America. According to Steinbeck's son Thom, Steinbeck made the journey because he knew he was dying and wanted to see the country one last time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonties.com/blog/2006/09/13/steinbeck-knew-he-was-dying/ Steinbeck knew he was dying] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070927223449/http://www.commonties.com/blog/2006/09/13/steinbeck-knew-he-was-dying/ |date=September 27, 2007 }}," September 13, 2006. Audio interview with Thom Steinbeck&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinbeck's last novel, ''[[The Winter of Our Discontent]]'' (1961), examines [[moral decline]] in America. The protagonist Ethan grows discontented with his own moral decline and that of those around him.&lt;ref name="Student" /&gt; The book has a very different tone from Steinbeck's amoral and ecological stance in earlier works like ''Tortilla Flat'' and ''Cannery Row''. It was not a critical success. Many reviewers recognized the importance of the novel, but were disappointed that it was not another ''Grapes of Wrath''.&lt;ref name="Student"&gt;Cynthia Burkhead, ''The students companion to John Steinbeck'', Greenwood Press, 2002, p. 24 {{ISBN|0-313-31457-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Nobel Prize presentation speech next year, however, the Swedish Academy cited it most favorably: "Here he attained the same standard which he set in The Grapes of Wrath. Again he holds his position as an independent expounder of the truth with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American, be it good or bad."&lt;ref name=nobel/&gt;

Apparently taken aback by the critical reception of this novel, and the critical outcry when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962,&lt;ref name=floodjan2013/&gt; Steinbeck published no more fiction in the next six years before his death.

===Nobel Prize===

In 1962, Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for literature for his "realistic and imaginative writing, combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perception." The selection was heavily criticized, and described as "one of the Academy's biggest mistakes" in one Swedish newspaper.&lt;ref name=floodjan2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/03/swedish-academy-controversy-steinbeck-nobel |title=Swedish Academy reopens controversy surrounding Steinbeck's Nobel prize |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Alison Flood |date=January 3, 2013 |accessdate=January 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713132223/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/jan/03/swedish-academy-controversy-steinbeck-nobel |archivedate=July 13, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction of American literary critics was also harsh. The ''New York Times'' asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose "limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising", noting that "[T]he international character of the award and the weight attached to it raise questions about the mechanics of selection and how close the Nobel committee is to the main currents of American writing. ... [W]e think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age".&lt;ref name=floodjan2013/&gt; Steinbeck, when asked on the day of the announcement if he deserved the Nobel, replied: "Frankly, no."&lt;ref name="Benson" /&gt;&lt;ref name=floodjan2013/&gt; Biographer Jackson Benson notes, "[T]his honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver. It was precisely because the committee made its judgment ... on its own criteria, rather than plugging into 'the main currents of American writing' as defined by the critical establishment, that the award had value."&lt;ref name="Benson" /&gt;&lt;ref name=floodjan2013/&gt; In his acceptance speech later in the year in Stockholm, he said:

In 2012, (50 years later), the Nobel Prize opened its archives and it was revealed that Steinbeck was a "compromise choice" among a shortlist consisting of Steinbeck, British authors [[Robert Graves]] and [[Lawrence Durrell]], French dramatist [[Jean Anouilh]] and Danish author [[Karen Blixen]].&lt;ref name=floodjan2013/&gt; The declassified documents showed that he was chosen as the best of a bad lot.&lt;ref name=floodjan2013/&gt; "There aren't any obvious candidates for the Nobel prize and the prize committee is in an unenviable situation," wrote committee member [[Henry Olsson]].&lt;ref name=floodjan2013/&gt; Although the committee believed Steinbeck's best work was behind him by 1962, committee member [[Anders Österling]] believed the release of his novel ''[[The Winter of Our Discontent]]'' showed that "after some signs of slowing down in recent years, [Steinbeck has] regained his position as a social truth-teller [and is an] authentic realist fully equal to his predecessors Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway."&lt;ref name=floodjan2013/&gt;

Although modest about his own talent as a writer, Steinbeck talked openly of his own admiration of certain writers. In 1953, he wrote that he considered cartoonist [[Al Capp]], creator of the satirical ''[[Li'l Abner]]'', "possibly the best writer in the world today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationarchive.org/2008/05/biography-al-capp-2-cappital-offense_08.html |title=ASIFA-Hollywood Animation Archive: Biography: Al Capp 2- A CAPPital Offense |accessdate=November 18, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324000815/http://www.animationarchive.org/2008/05/biography-al-capp-2-cappital-offense_08.html |archivedate=March 24, 2009 |df= }}. animationarchive.org (May 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; At his own first Nobel Prize press conference he was asked his favorite authors and works and replied: "[[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s short stories and nearly everything [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]] wrote."&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt;

In September 1964, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] awarded Steinbeck [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

In 1967, at the behest of ''[[Newsday]]'' magazine, Steinbeck went to [[Vietnam]] to report on the war. He thought of the [[Vietnam War]] as a heroic venture and was considered a [[War Hawk|hawk]] for his position on the war. His sons served in Vietnam before his death, and Steinbeck visited one son in the battlefield.  At one point he was allowed to man a machine-gun watch position at night at a [[fire support base|firebase]] while his son and other members of his platoon slept.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbeck, ''A Life in Letters''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:John Steinbeck with Elaine Scott 1950.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|John and Elaine Steinbeck in 1950]]
In May 1948, Steinbeck returned to California on an emergency trip to be with his friend Ed Ricketts, who had been seriously injured when a train struck his car. Ricketts died hours before Steinbeck arrived. Upon returning home, Steinbeck was confronted by Gwyn, who asked for a divorce, which became final in August. Steinbeck spent the year after Ricketts' death in deep depression.

In June 1949, Steinbeck met stage-manager [[Elaine Anderson Steinbeck|Elaine Scott]] at a restaurant in [[Carmel, California]]. Steinbeck and Scott eventually began a relationship and in December 1950 Steinbeck and Scott married, within a week of the finalizing of Scott's own divorce from actor [[Zachary Scott]]. This third marriage for Steinbeck lasted until his death in 1968.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

In 1962, Steinbeck began acting as friend and mentor to the young writer and naturalist [[Jack Rudloe]], who was trying to establish his own biological supply company, now [[Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory]] in Florida.

The day after Steinbeck's death in New York City, reviewer Charles Poore wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'': "John Steinbeck's first great book was his last great book. But Good Lord, what a book that was and is: ''The Grapes of Wrath''." Poore noted a "preachiness" in Steinbeck's work, "as if half his literary inheritance came from the best of [[Mark Twain]]— and the other half from the worst of [[Cotton Mather]]." But he asserted that "Steinbeck didn't need the Nobel Prize— the Nobel judges needed him."

Steinbeck's incomplete novel based on the [[King Arthur]] legends of Malory and others, ''[[The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights]]'', was  published in 1976.

Many of Steinbeck's works are required reading in American high schools. In the United Kingdom, ''Of Mice and Men'' is one of the key texts used by the examining body [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]] for its [[English Literature]] [[GCSE]].

The award of the 1962 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] to Steinbeck was controversial in the United States. The award citation lauded Steinbeck "for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic humour and keen social perception".  Many critics complained that the author's best works were behind him. ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an article by [[Arthur Mizener]] titled "Does a Writer with a Moral Vision of the 1930s Deserve the Nobel Prize?" that claimed Steinbeck was undeserving of the prestigious prize as he was a "limited talent" whose works were "watered down by tenth-rate philosophizing". Many American critics now consider these attacks to be politically motivated.&lt;ref name="John Steinbeck, despised"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Eric|title=John Steinbeck, despised and dismissed by the right and the left, was a real American radical|url=http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/local_news/article_4bd65e88-6803-59da-9ec2-0a62c5c8adbb.html|publisher=Monterey County Weekly|accessdate=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', in a 2013 article that revealed that Steinbeck had been a compromise choice for the Nobel Prize, called him a "Giant of American Letters".  Despite ongoing attacks on his literary reputation, Steinbeck's works continue to sell well and he is widely taught in American and British schools as a bridge to more complex literature. Works such as ''Of Mice and Men'' are short and easy to read, and compassionately illustrate universal themes that are still relevant in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Why do children study Of Mice and Men?"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who, what, why: Why do children study Of Mice and Men?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-12829392|publisher=BBC|accessdate=December 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107080104/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-12829392|archivedate=January 7, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary influences===
Steinbeck grew up in California's Salinas Valley, a culturally diverse place with a rich migratory and immigrant history. This upbringing imparted a regionalistic flavor to his writing, giving many of his works a distinct [[sense of place]].&lt;ref name="Biography" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;
Salinas, Monterey and parts of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] were the setting for many of his stories. The area is now sometimes referred to as "Steinbeck Country".&lt;ref name="Journey" /&gt; Most of his early work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years. An exception was his first novel, ''[[Cup of Gold: A Life of Sir Henry Morgan, Buccaneer, With Occasional Reference to History|Cup of Gold]]'', which concerns the pirate [[Henry Morgan]], whose adventures had captured Steinbeck's imagination as a child.

In his subsequent novels, Steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in California. His childhood friend, [[Max Wagner]], a brother of Jack Wagner and who later became a film actor, served as inspiration for ''The Red Pony''. Later he used actual American conditions and events in the first half of the 20th century, which he had experienced first-hand as a reporter. Steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters; his works examined the lives of the working class and [[migrant worker]]s during the [[Dust Bowl]] and the [[Great Depression]].

His later work reflected his wide range of interests, including [[marine biology]], politics, religion, history and [[mythology]]. One of his last published works was ''[[Travels with Charley]]'', a [[Travel literature|travelogue]] of a [[road trip]] he took in 1960 to rediscover America.

The [[National Steinbeck Center]], two blocks away at 1 [[Main Street]] is the only museum in the U.S. dedicated to a single author. Dana Gioia (chair of the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]) told an audience at the center, "This is really the best modern literary shrine in the country, and I've seen them all." Its "Steinbeckiana" includes "Rocinante", the camper-truck in which Steinbeck made the cross-country trip described in ''Travels with Charley''.

His father's cottage on Eleventh Street in Pacific Grove, where Steinbeck wrote some of his earliest books, also survives.&lt;ref name="Journey" /&gt;

In Monterey, [[Pacific Biological Laboratories|Ed Ricketts' laboratory]] survives (though it is not yet open to the public) and at the corner which Steinbeck describes in ''[[Cannery Row (novel)|Cannery Row]]'', also the store which once belonged to Lee Chong, and the adjacent vacant lot frequented by the hobos of Cannery Row. The site of the ''Hovden [[Sardine]] Cannery'' next to Doc's laboratory is now occupied by the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]]. In 1958 the street that Steinbeck described as "Cannery Row" in the novel, once named ''Ocean View Avenue'', was renamed ''[[Cannery Row]]'' in honor of the novel. The town of Monterey has commemorated Steinbeck's work with an avenue of flags depicting characters from ''Cannery Row'', historical plaques, and sculptured busts depicting Steinbeck and Ricketts.&lt;ref name="Journey" /&gt;

On February 27, 1979 (the 77th anniversary of the writer's birth), the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a stamp featuring Steinbeck, starting the Postal Service's Literary Arts series honoring American writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2008/sr08_015.htm |title=Pulitzer Prize-Winning Author Gets 'Stamp of Approval' |publisher=United States Postal Service |date=February 21, 2008 |accessdate=March 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326095700/http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2008/sr08_015.htm |archivedate=March 26, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
Steinbeck was affiliated to the St. Paul's Episcopal Church and he stayed attached throughout his life to [[Episcopalianism]]. Especially in his works of fiction, Steinbeck was highly conscious of religion and incorporated it into his style and themes. The shaping of his characters often drew on the [[Bible]] and the theology of [[Anglicanism]], combining elements of [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]].

Steinbeck distanced himself from religious views when he left Salinas for Stanford. However, the work he produced still reflected the language of his childhood at Salinas, and his beliefs remained a powerful influence within his fiction and non-fiction work. His Episcopal views are prominently displayed in ''The Grapes of Wrath'', in which themes of conversion and self-sacrifice play a major part in the characters Casy and Tom who achieve spiritual transcendence through conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, W. "John Steinbeck, Episcopalian: St. Paul's, Salinas, Part One." Steinbeck Review, vol. 10 no. 2, 2013, pp. 118–140. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/530751.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==

Steinbeck's contacts with [[leftist]] authors, journalists, and [[trade union|labor union]] figures may have influenced his writing.  He joined the [[League of American Writers]], a Communist organization, in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dave Stancliff |title=Remembering John Steinbeck, a great American writer |url= http://www.times-standard.com/letters/ci_22658148/remembering-john-steinbeck-great-american-writer |newspaper= [[Times-Standard]] |publisher= |date=February 24, 2013 |accessdate=June 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinbeck was mentored by radical writers [[Lincoln Steffens]] and his wife [[Ella Winter]]. Through [[Francis Whitaker]], a member of the [[Communist Party USA]]'s [[John Reed Club]] for writers, Steinbeck met with strike organizers from the [[United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America|Cannery and Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/20/jun02/steinbeck.htm Steinbeck and radicalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040204193303/http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/20/jun02/steinbeck.htm |date=February 4, 2004 }} New Criterion. Retrieved 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he signed a letter with some other writers in support of the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]] and the Soviet-established [[Finnish Democratic Republic|puppet government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Terijoen hallitus sai outoa tukea |language= Finnish |trans-title= The Terijoki Government received odd support |newspaper= [[Helsingin Sanomat]] |publisher= |date=November 29, 2009 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents, released by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in 2012, indicate that Steinbeck offered his services to the Agency in 1952, while planning a European tour, and the Director of Central Intelligence, [[Walter Bedell Smith]], was eager to take him up on the offer.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Kannard, ''Steinbeck: Citizen Spy'', Grave Distractions, 2013 {{ISBN|978-0-9890293-9-1}}, pp. 15–17.

Steinbeck was a close associate of [[playwright]] [[Arthur Miller]]. In June 1957, Steinbeck took a personal and professional risk by supporting him when Miller refused to name names in the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] trials.&lt;ref name="Bio3" /&gt; Steinbeck called the period one of the "strangest and most frightening times a government and people have ever faced."&lt;ref name="Bio3"&gt;Jackson J. Benson, ''John Steinbeck, Writer: A Biography'', Penguin, 1990 {{ISBN|0-14-014417-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, when he was sent to Vietnam to report on the [[Vietnam war|war]], his sympathetic portrayal of the [[United States Army]] led the ''[[New York Post]]'' to denounce him for betraying his liberal past. Steinbeck's biographer, [[Jay Parini]], says Steinbeck's friendship with [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]] influenced his views on Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;Jay Parini, ''John Steinbeck: A Biography'', Holt Publishing, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Steinbeck may also have been concerned about the safety of his son serving in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gladstein|first=Mimi R.|last2=Meredith|first2=James H.|date=June 14, 2011|title=John Steinbeck and the Tragedy of the Vietnam War|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1754-6087.2011.01137.x|journal=Steinbeck Review|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=39–56|doi=10.1111/j.1754-6087.2011.01137.x|issn=1546-007X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government harassment===
Steinbeck complained publicly about government harassment. Thomas Steinbeck, the author's eldest son, said that [[J. Edgar Hoover]], director of the [[FBI]] at the time, could find no basis for prosecuting Steinbeck and therefore used his power to encourage the [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service]] to audit Steinbeck's taxes every single year of his life, just to annoy him. According to Thomas, a true artist is one who "without a thought for self, stands up against the stones of condemnation, and speaks for those who are given no real voice in the halls of justice, or the halls of government. By doing so, these people will naturally become the enemies of the political status quo."&lt;ref&gt;[[Huffington Post]], September 27, 2010, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thomas-steinbeck/michael-moore-steinbeck-award_b_738727.html John Steinbeck, Michael Moore, and the Burgeoning Role of Planetary Patriotism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930050328/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thomas-steinbeck/michael-moore-steinbeck-award_b_738727.html |date=September 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1942 letter to United States Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]], John Steinbeck wrote: "Do you suppose you could ask Edgar's boys to stop stepping on my heels? They think I am an enemy alien. It is getting tiresome."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/steinbeck1.html Steinbeck Political Beliefs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051022031947/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/steinbeck1.html |date=October 22, 2005 }}, Smoking Gun Part 1.

==Major works==

===''In Dubious Battle''===
{{Main|In Dubious Battle}}
In 1936, Steinbeck published the first of what came to be known as his Dustbowl trilogy, which included ''Of Mice and Men'' and ''The Grapes of Wrath''. This first novel tells the story of a fruit pickers' strike in California which is both aided and damaged by the help of "the Party," generally taken to be the [[Communist Party]], although this is never spelled out in the book.

===''Of Mice and Men''===
{{Main|Of Mice and Men}}
''Of Mice and Men'' is a tragedy that was written as a play in 1937. The story is about two traveling ranch workers, George and Lennie, trying to earn enough money to buy their own farm/ranch. As it is set in 1930s America, it provides an insight into The Great Depression, encompassing themes of racism, loneliness, prejudice against the mentally ill, and the struggle for personal independence. Along with ''The Grapes of Wrath'', ''East of Eden'', and ''The Pearl'', ''Of Mice and Men'' is one of Steinbeck's best known works. It was made into a movie three times, [[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|in 1939]] starring [[Burgess Meredith]], [[Lon Chaney Jr.]], and [[Betty Field]], in 1982 starring [[Randy Quaid]], [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] and [[Ted Neeley]], and [[Of Mice and Men (1992 film)|in 1992]] starring [[Gary Sinise]] and [[John Malkovich]].

===''The Grapes of Wrath''===
{{Main|The Grapes of Wrath}}
The ''Grapes of Wrath'' is set in the [[Great Depression]] and describes a family of [[sharecropper]]s, the Joads, who were driven from their land due to the dust storms of the [[Dust Bowl]]. The title is a reference to the [[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]. Some critics found it too sympathetic to the workers' plight and too critical of capitalism, but found a large audience of its own. It won both the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize for fiction (novels) and was adapted as a [[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|film]] starring [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Jane Darwell]] and directed by [[John Ford]].

===''East of Eden''===
{{Main|East of Eden (novel)}}
Steinbeck deals with the nature of good and evil in this Salinas Valley saga. The story follows two families: the Hamiltons&amp;nbsp;– based on Steinbeck's own maternal ancestry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/IN-STEINBECK-COUNTRY-As-America-celebrates-the-2869887.php|title=In Steinbeck Country|last=Nolte|first=Carl|date=February 24, 2002|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922051900/http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/IN-STEINBECK-COUNTRY-As-America-celebrates-the-2869887.php|archive-date=September 22, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and the Trasks, reprising stories about the Biblical Adam and his progeny. The book was published in 1952. It was made into a 1955 movie directed by [[Elia Kazan]] and starring [[James Dean]].

===''Travels with Charley''===
{{Main|Travels with Charley: In Search of America}}
In 1960, Steinbeck bought a pickup truck and had it modified with a custom-built [[campervan|camper top]]&amp;nbsp;– which was rare at the time&amp;nbsp;– and drove across the United States with his faithful 'blue' [[standard poodle]], Charley. Steinbeck nicknamed his truck ''[[Rocinante]]'' after [[Don Quixote]]'s "noble steed". In this sometimes comical, sometimes melancholic book, Steinbeck describes what he sees from [[Maine]] to [[Montana]] to California, and from there to [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]] and back to his home on [[Long Island]]. The restored camper truck is on exhibit in the [[National Steinbeck Center]] in Salinas.

'''Joseph Charles Wilson IV''' (born November 6, 1949) is a former United States diplomat best known for his 2002 trip to [[Niger]] to investigate allegations that [[Saddam Hussein]] was attempting to purchase [[yellowcake]] uranium; his ''[[New York Times]]'' [[op-ed]] piece, "What I Didn't Find in Africa";&lt;ref name=wilsonoped&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Joseph|title=What I Didn't Find In Africa|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/opinion/what-i-didn-t-find-in-africa.html|accessdate=30 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the subsequent leaking of information pertaining to the identity of his wife [[Valerie Plame]] as a CIA agent. He is the CEO of a consulting firm he founded, JC Wilson International Ventures.  In January 2007, Wilson joined Jarch Capital, LLC, as vice chairman.

==Early life and education==
Joseph C. Wilson, IV, was born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], in 1949 to Joseph Charles Wilson, III, and Phyllis (Finnell) Wilson; he grew up in California and Europe (Wilson, ''[[The Politics of Truth]]'' 32–33).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/01/iraq/main576052.shtml "Wilson: From Envoy to Accuser:] Profile of the Diplomat at the Center of the CIA Leak Dispute", ''[[CBS News]]'', October 1, 2003, "Special Report: Iraq After Saddam", accessed July 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in a "proud [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] family" in which "there [was] a long tradition of politics and service to the farm" and for which "[p]olitics was a staple around the table" (Wilson, ''[[The Politics of Truth]]'' 31).  His mother's uncle, [[James Rolph|James "Sunny Jim" Rolph]], was mayor of San Francisco, [[California]], from 1912 to 1931 and served as California's governor until his 1934 death in office (''[[The Politics of Truth]]'' 31). Wilson's mother's brothers jokingly referred to noted conservative [[Barry Goldwater]] as "a bit liberal" (31).  Military service was also a strong part of his family history. Both of Wilson's grandfathers served in the two world wars, his paternal grandfather receiving both the British [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and the [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|French Croix de Guerre]] for his service in World War I (32). Wilson's father Joe was a Marine pilot in World War II and narrowly escaped death by taking off immediately before the bombing of the aircraft carrier [[USS Franklin (CV-13)|USS ''Franklin'']], in which 700 other American servicemen died (31).

In 1968, Wilson matriculated at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], majoring, he once joked, in "history, volleyball, and surfing" and maintaining a [[Academic grading in North America|"C" average]] (''[[The Politics of Truth]]'' 32).  He worked as a carpenter for five years after his 1972 graduation.&lt;ref name=Leiby&gt;Richard Leiby, [http://u-r-next.com/wilsonBio.htm "Man Behind the Furor: Wilson: Envoy With an Independent Streak"] ''[[Washington Post]]'' October 1, 2003, A01; rpt. in ''u-r-next.com'', accessed September 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he became more serious about his education, winning a graduate fellowship and studying public administration.&lt;ref name=Leiby/&gt;  The [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|Vietnam War protests]] of the late 1960s galvanized Wilson along with much of his generation and "pitted parents against kids in [his] family just as it did in many households around the country" (''[[The Politics of Truth]]'' 32).

==Personal life and family==
Wilson's first marriage was to his college sweetheart Susan Otchis in 1974 (''[[The Politics of Truth]]'' 33).  In 1979, the couple had a set of twins, Sabrina Cecile and Joseph Charles V.  The marriage ended in an amicable divorce in 1986, toward the end of his service in [[Burundi]].  Wilson married his second wife Jacqueline, a French diplomat, raised in Africa, in 1986 (86–89).  Though Wilson and Jacqueline began to live separate lives in the 1990s, they did not divorce until 1998 because Wilson "was never in one place long enough to complete the process" (242).  Wilson had met [[Valerie Plame]] in 1997, while working for President [[Bill Clinton]]; they married in 1998, after Wilson's divorce from Jacqueline (242). Wilson lives in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], with his wife and their two children, twins Trevor Rolph and Samantha Finnell Diana, born in 2000.&lt;ref name=GoodmanGonzalez/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
Having become fluent in French as a teenager, Wilson entered the [[US Foreign Service]] in 1976, where he would be employed until 1998.&lt;ref name=Dip&gt;Wilson, ''[[The Politics of Truth]]'' 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 1976 through 1998, he was posted in five African nations; as a general services officer in [[Niamey, Niger]], (his first assignment) he was "responsible for keeping the power on and the cars running, among other duties".&lt;ref name=Leiby/&gt;  From 1988 to 1991, he was the [[Deputy Chief of Mission]] (to US Ambassador to Iraq [[April Glaspie]]) at the US Embassy in [[Baghdad]], Iraq. In the wake of Iraq's 1990 [[invasion of Kuwait]], he became the last American diplomat to meet with Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]], telling him in very clear terms to leave Kuwait (Wilson, ''[[The Politics of Truth]]'' 107–27).  When Hussein sent a note to Wilson (along with other embassy heads in Baghdad) threatening to execute anyone sheltering foreigners in Iraq, Wilson publicly repudiated the dictator by appearing at a press conference wearing a homemade noose around his neck and declaring, "If the choice is to allow American citizens to be taken hostage or to be executed, I will bring my own fucking rope."

Despite Hussein's threats, Wilson sheltered more than 100 Americans at the embassy and successfully evacuated several thousand people (Americans and other nationals) from Iraq. For his actions, he was called "a true American hero" by President [[George H. W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=GoodmanGonzalez&gt;[[Amy Goodman]] and Juan Gonzalez, [http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/05/1415239 "'He Has Subverted the Rule of Law and the System of Justice'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710201415/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07%2F07%2F05%2F1415239 |date=2007-07-10 }} – Former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson Reacts to Bush's Commutation of Lewis 'Scooter' Libby Jail Sentence in Outing of Valerie Plame", "Rush Transcript" of interview with Joseph C.

From 1995 to 1997, Wilson served as Political Advisor (POLAD) to the Commander in Chief of US Armed Forces, Europe ([[EUCOM]]), in [[Stuttgart, Germany]].  From 1997 until 1998, when he retired, he helped direct Africa policy as Special Assistant to President [[Bill Clinton]] and as National Security Council Senior Director for African Affairs.&lt;ref name=career&gt;Chaps. 8–10 on 182–210 of Wilson, ''[[The Politics of Truth]]''; 261–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent employment==

(Speakers Bureau), accessed July 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 2007, Wilson became vice chairman of Jarch Capital, LLC., to advise the firm on expansion in areas of Africa considered "politically sensitive."&lt;ref name=JarchPR&gt;[[Phillippe M. Heilberg|Phil Heilberg]], Chairman, Jarch Capital, LLC, [http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article19833 "Ambassador Joe Wilson Begins Working With Jarch Capital, LLC as Vice Chairman"], Jarch Capital press release, ''[[The Sudan Tribune]]'', January 19, 2007, accessed January 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson serves as a guest speaker and panelist in conferences and other programs devoted to African business policies and political affairs, as well as on the matters pertaining to the [[CIA leak scandal]].

==Political involvement==
At the midpoint of his career as a diplomat, Wilson served for a year (1985–1986) as a Congressional Fellow in the offices of Senator [[Al Gore]] and Representative [[Tom Foley]]; he would later attribute his working for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to "happenstance."&lt;ref name=VanityFair&gt;Vicky Ward, [http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2004/01/plame200401?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all "Double Exposure"], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', January 2004, accessed September 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  That experience helped him gain his position as Special Assistant to President [[Bill Clinton]] and Senior Director for African Affairs, National Security Council, in 1997–1998.

Over the years, Wilson has made contributions to the campaigns of Democratic candidates, such as Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of Massachusetts and Congressman [[Charles B. Rangel]] of New York, and to Republican Congressman [[Ed Royce]] of California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.asp?txtName=wilson&amp;txtState=DC&amp;txtZip=&amp;txtEmploy=&amp;txtCand=&amp;txt2006=&amp;txt2004=&amp;txt2002=&amp;txt2000=Y&amp;txt1998=Y&amp;txt1996=&amp;txt1994=&amp;txt1992=&amp;txt1990=&amp;txtSoft=N&amp;Order=N&amp;Cycles=2&amp;Cycle1=2000&amp;Cycle2=1998&amp;Cycle3=&amp;Page=2 Joseph C.

In 2003, Wilson endorsed [[John Kerry]] for president and donated to his campaign; in 2003 and 2004, he served as an advisor to and speechwriter for the campaign (410–12).&lt;ref name=newsmeat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curl&gt;Joseph Curl, [http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040214-120835-4661r.htm "Spouse of Outed CIA Officer Signs On with Kerry,"] ''[[Washington Times]]'' February 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2008 US presidential election]].&lt;ref name=WilsonClinton&gt;[http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=2426 "Frm.

After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Wilson supported activist groups like Win Without War, a [[nonpartisan]] coalition of groups united in [[opposition to the Iraq War]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winwithoutwarus.org/html/press_9.24.2003.html Press release] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919184256/http://www.winwithoutwarus.org/html/press_9.24.2003.html |date=2006-09-19 }}, ''winwithoutwarus.org'', September 24, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the invasion and the publication of his memoir, ''[[The Politics of Truth]]'', he has spoken frequently in the public media and at colleges and universities.

==Trip to Niger==
In late February 2002, Wilson traveled to [[Niger]] at the CIA's request to investigate the possibility that [[Saddam Hussein]] had purchased enriched [[yellowcake]] uranium. Wilson met with the current US Ambassador to Niger, [[Barbro Owens-Kirkpatrick]] (1999–2002) at the embassy and then interviewed dozens of officials who had been in the Niger government at the time of the supposed deal.  He ultimately concluded: "it was highly doubtful that any such transaction had ever taken place."&lt;ref name=wilsonoped/&gt;&lt;ref group=notes name=16wordstimeline&gt;See Wilson's "Timeline" entitled "Events surrounding the 'Sixteen Words' and the Disclosure of the Undercover Status of CIA Operative Valerie Plame, Wife of Ambassador Joseph Wilson":

Wilson learned that the Iraqis had in fact requested a meeting to discuss "expanding commercial relations" but that Niger's Prime Minister [[Ibrahim Assane Mayaki|Mayaki]] had declined, due to concern about U.N. sanctions against Iraq.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;According to the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] ''[[Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq|Report on the US Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq]]'' (2004), on the basis of his trip to Niger, &lt;blockquote&gt;In an interview with Committee staff, the former ambassador [Wilson] was able to provide more information about the meeting between former [Niger] Prime Minister Mayaki and the Iraqi delegation. ... [Wilson] said that Mayaki did meet with the Iraqi delegation but never discussed what was meant by [the two countries] "expanding commercial relations" [being suggested by the Iraqis]. ... [Wilson] said that because Mayaki was wary of discussing any trade issues with a country under United Nations (UN) sanctions, he made a successful effort to steer the conversation away from a discussion of trade with the Iraqi delegation."

=="What I Didn't Find in Africa"==
President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address included these [[September Dossier|16 words]]: "The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa."&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/01/20030128-19.html "President Delivers "State of the Union: The U.S. Capitol"], press release, ''[[The White House]]'', January 28, 2003, accessed July 23, 2007.  (Full transcript of the speech.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g, [http://www.cnn.com/interactive/allpolitics/0307/bush.16.words/content2.html "16 Words"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211193240/http://www.cnn.com/interactive/allpolitics/0307/bush.16.words/content2.html |date=2008-12-11 }} and "previous" link as provided by ''[[CNN]].com'', March 7, 2003, accessed July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In response, in the July 6, 2003, issue of ''[[The New York Times]]'', Wilson contributed an "op-ed" entitled "What I Didn't Find in Africa", in which he states that on the basis of his "experience with the administration in the months leading up to the war", he has "little choice but to conclude that some of the intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat."&lt;ref name=wilsonoped/&gt;

Wilson describes the basis for his mission to Niger as follows: "The vice president's office asked a serious question [about the truth of allegations that Iraq was seeking to purchase [[uranium]] [[yellowcake]] from Niger]. I was asked to help formulate the answer".&lt;ref name=wilsonoped/&gt;

In the last two paragraphs of his op-ed, Wilson relates his perspective to the Bush administration's rationale for the [[Iraq War]]:

{{quote|I was convinced before the war that the threat of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein required a vigorous and sustained international response to disarm him. Iraq possessed and had used chemical weapons; it had an active biological weapons program and quite possibly a nuclear research program—all of which were in violation of United Nations resolutions.  Having encountered Mr. Hussein and his thugs in the run-up to the Persian Gulf war of 1991, I was only too aware of the dangers he posed.

But were these dangers the same ones the administration told us about? We have to find out. America's foreign policy depends on the sanctity of its information. For this reason, questioning the selective use of intelligence to justify the war in Iraq is neither idle sniping nor "revisionist history", as Mr. Bush has suggested. The act of war is the last option of a democracy, taken when there is a grave threat to our national security. More than 200 American soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq already. We have a duty to ensure that their sacrifice came for the right reasons.&lt;ref name=wilsonoped/&gt;}}

==Administration reactions to disclosure==

At a press conference on Monday, July 7, 2003, the day after the publication of the op-ed, [[Colin Powell]] said: "There was sufficient evidence floating around at that time that such a statement was not totally outrageous or not to be believed or not to be appropriately used. It's that once we used the statement, and after further analysis, and looking at other estimates we had, and other information that was coming in, it turned out that the basis upon which that statement was made didn't hold up, and we said so, and we've acknowledged it, and we've moved on." He also said: "the case I put down on the 5th of February [2003], for an hour and 20 minutes, roughly, on terrorism, on weapons of mass destruction, and on the human rights case ... we stand behind"&lt;ref name=NHJLPBS&gt;As reported in [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/white_house/july-dec03/iraq_07-10.html "Defending Claims,"] broadcast on ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'', ''Online NewsHour'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], July 10, 2003, accessed September 18, 2006 (Both transcript and streaming video available online).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 11, 2003, statement, CIA director [[George Tenet]], stated that the President, Vice President and other senior administration officials were not briefed on Wilson's report (otherwise widely distributed in the intelligence community) because it "did not resolve whether Iraq was or was not seeking uranium from abroad".&lt;ref name=TenetCIAPR&gt;Quoted from [[George Tenet]], [https://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/press_release/2003/pr07112003.html "Statement by George J. Tenet, Director of Central Intelligence,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030714043115/http://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/press_release/2003/pr07112003.html |date=2003-07-14 }} official press release, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] July 11, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2007 memoir, Tenet writes that Wilson's report "produced no solid answers" and "was never delivered to Cheney.  In fact, I have no recollection myself of hearing about Wilson's trip at the time."&lt;ref name=Tenetmemoir&gt;[[George Tenet]], ''[[At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA]]'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2007) 454. {{ISBN|978-0-06-114778-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the July 11 statement, Tenet also notes that, according to Wilson's report, a former Niger official interpreted an Iraqi approach as an "overture as an attempt to discuss uranium sales."&lt;ref name=TenetCIAPR/&gt; Asked about this the following October, Wilson  said that the official in question had declined the meeting, due to U.N. Security Council sanctions against Iraq, but speculated "maybe they might have wanted to talk about uranium".&lt;ref name=wilsonmtp20031005 group=notes &gt;On [[Meet the Press]] with [[Tim Russert]] on October 5, 2003, Wilson said: "An intermediary came to this official, and said, 'I want you to meet with these guys. They're interested in talking about expanding commercial relations.'  The person who talked to me said, 'Red flags went up immediately, I thought of U.N. Security Council sanctions, I thought of all sorts of other reasons why we didn't want to have any meeting. I declined the meeting', and this was out of the country, on the margins of an OIC meeting. So it was a meeting that did not take place. And at one point during the conversation, this official kind of looked up in the sky and plumbing his conscience, looked back and said, "You know, maybe they might have wanted to talk about uranium."

There has been substantial disagreement about whether Wilson implies in the Op Ed that he was sent to Niger at the request of the vice president, or his office.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeralyn-merritt/russert-and-libby-the-sh_b_9762.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Jeralyn | last=Merritt | title=Russert and Libby: The Show That Caused the Fury | date=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication that Cheney or his office sent Wilson to Niger, whether made by Wilson or the media, was apparently a cause of consternation to vice-presidential aide I. Lewis Libby, who called NBC's Tim Russert to complain.&lt;ref&gt;"On or about July 10, 2003, LIBBY spoke to NBC Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert to complain about press coverage of LIBBY by an MSNBC reporter.

On July 6, 2003, in a ''[[Meet the Press]]'' interview with [[Andrea Mitchell]], Wilson stated: "The question was asked of the CIA by the office of the vice president. The office of the vice president, I am absolutely convinced, received a very specific response to the question it asked and that response was based upon my trip out there."&lt;ref&gt;[http://justoneminute.typepad.com/footnotes/2004/07/joe_wilson_with.html "Joe Wilson with Andrea Mitchell, July 6, 2003"], online posting of transcript of ''[[Meet the Press]]'' for July 6, 2003, in "Footnotes", ''JustOneMinute'' (blog), July 20, 2004, accessed July 23, 2007.

==Disclosure of Valerie Plame's Identity==
{{main|Valerie Plame}}

The week after the publication of Wilson's ''New York Times'' op ed, [[Robert Novak]], in his syndicated ''[[Washington Post]]'' column, disclosed that Wilson's wife, [[Valerie Plame]], worked for the CIA as an agency operative.  Subsequently, former Ambassador Wilson and others alleged that the disclosure was part of the Bush administration's attempts to discredit his report about his investigations in Africa and the op-ed describing his findings because they did not support the government's rationale for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].  Wilson's allegations led to a federal investigation of the leak by the [[United States Department of Justice]], to the appointment of a Special Counsel [[Patrick Fitzgerald]], to the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]], and to a major [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|American political scandal]] variously dubbed by the press "[[Plamegate]]", the "[[Plame affair]]", the "[[CIA leak scandal]]", and other terms relating to the public disclosure or "leak" of Mrs. Wilson's then-classified covert CIA identity as "Valerie Plame".

In 2005, retired US Army Major General [[Paul E. Vallely]] claimed that former Ambassador Wilson "mentioned Plame's status as a CIA employee" in 2002 [one year before she was allegedly "outed"] in the [[Fox News]] Channel's "green room" in Washington, D.C., as they waited to appear on air as analysts.&lt;ref&gt;''The John Batchelor Show'': [http://www.johnbatchelorshow.com/showDetail.cfm?id=225&amp;start=201&amp;groupStart=6 November 3, 2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101143851/http://www.johnbatchelorshow.com/showDetail.cfm?id=225&amp;start=201&amp;groupStart=6 |date=November 1, 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no one was "indicted for actually leaking Plame's identity,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/08/leak.armitage/index.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com – Armitage admits leaking Plame's identity – Sep 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the investigation resulted in the federal criminal trial ''[[United States v. Libby]]'' in which [[Lewis Libby]], the former Chief of Staff to [[Vice President of the United States]], [[Dick Cheney]], was tried on five federal felony counts.  He was convicted on four of the counts, involving false statements, perjury, and obstruction of justice, none of which related directly to the Plame revelation but rather to his failure to cooperate with the subsequent investigation into the revelation. Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Libby's prison sentence was commuted by President Bush, who let the conviction and fine stand.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Libby clemency controversy]]&lt;/ref&gt; Libby was later granted a full pardon by President Trump.

==''The Politics of Truth''==
In 2004, Wilson published a political and personal memoir entitled ''[[The Politics of Truth|The Politics of Truth: Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity: A Diplomat's Memoir]]''. The book describes his diplomatic career, his personal life and family, and his experiences during the [[Valerie Plame affair]]. Wilson's autobiographical account of over two decades of his life in foreign service includes detailed descriptions of his extensive diplomatic-career experiences, his first marriage and family, briefer references to his second marriage, his meeting of [[Valerie Plame]], their courtship and marriage, and a detailed narrative of the events leading to his decision to go public with his criticisms of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]] and its aftermath.

==Commentaries==
An editorial in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' published in mid-July 2004,  finds some justification for his perspective presented in "What I Didn't Find in Africa",  but highlights some evidence of Iraq's ''attempts'' at acquiring uranium [[yellowcake]] from African nations such as Niger, on which Iraq did not follow through.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110005353 "On the Record: Saddam, Uranium and Africa: What Two Investigations Say about Bush's Statements on Iraq, Yellowcake and Niger"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', July 15, 2004, accessed September 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

But another editorial published in the July 13, 2005, ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' asserts that Wilson had lied in his "What I Didn't Find in Africa" about "what he'd discovered in Africa, how he'd discovered it, what he'd told the CIA about it, or even why he was sent on the mission."&lt;ref name=RevOutlook&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110006955 "Karl Rove, Whistleblower: He Told the Truth about Joe Wilson"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' July 13, 2005, Review &amp; Outlook: Editorial.&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial headlined "A Good Leak" published in the April 9, 2006, ''[[Washington Post]]'' claims that "Mr. Wilson was the one guilty of twisting the truth and that, in fact, his report [to the CIA] supported the conclusion that Iraq had sought uranium."&lt;ref name=goodleak&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/08/AR2006040800895.html "A Good Leak: President Bush Declassified Some of the Intelligence He Used to Decide On War in Iraq. Is that a scandal?"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 9, 2006: B06, accessed September 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators and newspaper readers believed that this ''Washington Post'' editorial contradicted a news article in the paper's same issue, which reported that the administration had misrepresented its actual confidence level in the intelligence reports that Hussein was seeking uranium.&lt;ref name=LinzerGellman &gt;{{cite news|first1=Dafna |last1=Linzer |first2=Barton |last2=Gellman |first3=Julie|last3= Tate |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/08/AR2006040800916_pf.html |title=A 'Concerted Effort' to Discredit Bush Critic |publisher=The Washington Post |date=April 9, 2006  |page=A01 |accessdate= July 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;"At Cheney's instruction, Libby testified, he [Libby] told [reporter] Miller that the uranium story was a 'key judgment' of the intelligence estimate, a term of art indicating there was consensus on a question of central importance.  In fact, the alleged effort to buy uranium was not among the estimate's key judgments, which were identified by a headline and bold type and set out in bullet form in the first five pages of the 96-page document ... US intelligence 'did not know' the status of Iraq's procurement efforts, 'cannot confirm' any success and had 'inconclusive' evidence about Iraq's domestic uranium operations. ... The State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, likewise, called the claim 'highly dubious.'  For those reasons, the uranium story was relegated to a brief inside passage in the October estimate."&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaints to the ''Washington Post'' ombudsman Deborah Howell about the apparent contradiction between the article and editorial, resulted in her acknowledging "the high wall between editorial and news" and also that "it would have been helpful if the editorial had put statements about Wilson in more context".&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Replying to complaints from various readers, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' [[ombudsman]], [[Deborah Howell]], notes that in their front-page news report [[Barton Gellman]] and Dafna Linzer relied on Fitzgerald's representations in his legal filings, that the editorial's writer wrote it before the front-page report, and that although the writer had not read the report, it would not have changed his mind.  Howell notes that the basis for the editorial's claim that Wilson's report "supported the conclusion that Iraq had sought uranium" was the fact that there was a meeting between Iraqi and Nigerien trade officials "because that's mostly what Niger has to export."  She observes that the editorial inconsistently deals with the 2004 [[Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq|report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], which notes that "the [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research|State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] analysts believed that [Wilson's] report supported their assessment that Niger was unlikely to be willing or able to sell uranium to Iraq."  Howell concludes:&lt;blockquote&gt;It would have been helpful if the editorial had put statements about Wilson in more context—especially the controversy over his trip and what he said. It also could have used a sentence to say what is known in every newsroom: Leaks are good for journalism.

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the Gellman/Linzer story, it would have been good to quote more from the WMD commission's and Iraq Survey Group's reports and specifically their conclusions.

Both pieces demonstrate the high wall between editorial and news. While editorial writers read reporters' stories, Executive Editor Len Downie doesn't regularly read editorials (although he read this one) lest it make a mark on how he runs the news pages.

Some readers think it's a scandal when two parts of the newspaper appear to be in conflict with each other, but it's not that unusual that reporting—particularly in news and editorial—will depend on different sources. It happened again last week when an editorial and a story gave different estimates for how long it might take Iran to build a nuclear bomb.

Reporting about national security and intelligence gathering is always fraught with fraught [sic]; it is a subject I will write about again. Deborah Howell, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401393.html "Two Views of the Libby Leak Case"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', April 16, 2006: B06, accessed September 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Richard Armitage==
In their 2006 book ''Hubris'', [[Michael Isikoff]] and [[David Corn]] assert that it was [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]], Deputy Secretary of State, who first revealed that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA to [[Robert Novak]] sometime before July 8, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Isikoff]] and [[David Corn]], ''Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War'' (New York: Crown, [September 8] 2006). {{ISBN|0-307-34681-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In late August 2006, along with advance publicity for the book, news accounts and editorials began focusing on that public revelation: "Richard L. Armitage, a former deputy secretary of state, has acknowledged that he was the person whose conversation with a columnist in 2003 prompted a long, politically laden criminal investigation in what became known as the C.I.A. leak case, a lawyer involved in the case said on Tuesday [August 29, 2006]."&lt;ref name=armitageny&gt;Neil A. Lewis, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/washington/30armitage.html "Source of C.I.A. Leak Said to Admit Role"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 30, 2006, accessed January 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson and his wife then amended their civil lawsuit (see below) to add Armitage as a defendant along with Vice President Dick Cheney and I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby.  According to their complaint, Richard Armitage was being sued individually (independently of his White House colleagues) for having nevertheless also violated Plame's right to privacy and property (ability to make a living), while not reducing the culpability of the others as claimed.&lt;ref name=CBSArmitageAdded/&gt;

In a column posted in TownHall.com on 14 September 2006, however, [[Robert Novak|Novak]] disputes details of Armitage's contemporaneous media accounts of their conversations. According to Novak, "Armitage did not, as he now indicates, merely pass on something he had heard and that he 'thought' might be so. Rather, he identified to me the CIA division where Mrs. Wilson worked, and said flatly that she recommended the mission to Niger by her husband, former Amb. Joseph Wilson. Second, Armitage did not slip me this information as idle chitchat, as he now suggests. He made clear he considered it especially suited for my column." He noted that critics would not be able to "fit Armitage into the left-wing fantasy of a well-crafted White House conspiracy to destroy Joe and Valerie Wilson. The news that he and not Karl Rove was the leaker was devastating news for the Left."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Novak]], [http://www.townhall.com/columnists/RobertDNovak/2006/09/14/armitages_leak "Armitage's Leak"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106005522/http://www.townhall.com/columnists/RobertDNovak/2006/09/14/armitages_leak |date=2007-11-06 }}, ''[[TownHall.com]]'', September 14, 2006, accessed September 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''American Journalism Review'',  editor Rem Rieder noted that the disclosure that Armitage was Novak's "primary source" was insufficiently covered in the media.&lt;ref name=Rieder&gt;Rem Rieder, [http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4184 "October/November Preview: Whatever"]: "After Months of Saturation [[Plame affair|Plamegate]] Coverage, the Media Couldn't Work Up Much Excitement When the Person Who Revealed [[Valerie Plame]]'s CIA Role Was Identified", ''[[American Journalism Review]]'' (Philip Merrill College of Journalism, [[University of Maryland, College Park]]), Aug./September 2006, accessed September 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the verdict on March 6, 2007, finding [[Lewis Libby]] guilty of four of the five charges in the Fitzgerald grand jury indictment against him, the Wilsons issued a statement in a press release posted on the website of [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]].  They stated that they respected the jury's verdict and believed justice was done, as well as affirming their commitment to pursuing their civil suit.&lt;ref name=verdictstatment&gt;[http://www.citizensforethics.org/press/newsrelease.php?view=205 "Statement in Response to Jury's Verdict in U.S. v. I. Lewis 'Scooter' Libby"], press release ''[[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]]'' (CREW), March 6, 2007, accessed March 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson criticized President [[George W. Bush]]'s July 2, 2007, commutation of [[Lewis Libby]]'s prison sentence, calling it "a cover-up of the Vice President's role in this matter and quite possibly the role of the President and/or some of his senior White House advisers."&lt;ref name=GoodmanGonzalez/&gt;&lt;ref name=WilsonStmtComm group=notes&gt;For Wilson's full published statement in response to the commutation and the press conference about it by President Bush's press spokesman [[Tony Snow]], see Joseph C.

==Warner Bros. feature film==
On the evening of the verdict in the Libby trial, Joseph C. Wilson appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', during which he announced that he and his wife had "signed a deal with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros]] of [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to offer their consulting services—or maybe more—in the making of the forthcoming movie about the Libby trial", their lives and the CIA leak scandal.&lt;ref name=Frei&gt;Matt Frei [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6425311.stm "Washington diary: Libby, the Movie"], ''[[BBC News]]'' (Washington) March 7, 2007, accessed March 18, 2007; cf. transcript of Larry King interview with Joseph C.

==Civil suit==
{{Main|Valerie Plame#The Wilsons' civil suit|Lewis Libby#The Wilsons' civil suit|Wilson v. Cheney}}
On July 13, 2006, a civil suit was filed by Joseph and Valerie Wilson against Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], his former Chief of Staff [[Lewis Libby|I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby]], top Presidential advisor [[Karl Rove]], and other unnamed senior White House officials (among whom they later added [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]]), for their alleged role in the public disclosure of Valerie Wilson's classified CIA status.&lt;ref&gt;[[Proskauer Rose]] LLP, [http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/060713/20060713005646.html?.v=1 "Valerie Plame Wilson and Ambassador Joseph Wilson Initiate a Civil Action] Against Vice President Cheney, Karl Rove, and Scooter Libby for Violations of their Constitutional and Other Legal Rights", ''[[Yahoo]] Business Wire'' (Press Release), July 13, 2006, accessed July 15, 2006; cf. {{cite web|url= http://howappealing.law.com/PlameAddressOrder.pdf |title="Lame Plame Game Flames Out" }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(41.8&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, rpt. in ''How Appealing'' (blog), July 13, 2006, accessed July 15. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
On September 13, 2006, Joseph and Valerie Wilson amended their original lawsuit, adding [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]] as a fourth defendant.&lt;ref name=CBSArmitageAdded&gt;[[Melanie Sloan]], Executive Director, [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW), press release, as qtd. in [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/13/politics/main2006236.shtml "Armitage Added to Plame Law Suit"], ''[[CBS News]]'', September 13, 2006, accessed September 25, 2006; accessed January 7, 2008; includes hyperlinked amended complaint, {{cite web|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/wilson091306.pdf |title=Document 8 }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(183&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}. ([[Cf.]]  [http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/plame/wilsonlibby91306acmp.html Amended complaint] at ''FindLaw.com''.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike their charges against Rove, Cheney, and Libby, "claiming that they had violated her constitutional rights and discredited her by disclosing that she was an undercover CIA operative", the Wilsons sued Armitage "for violating the 'Wilsons' constitutional right to privacy, Mrs. Wilson's constitutional right to property, and for committing the tort of publication of private facts.'"&lt;ref name=CBSArmitageAdded/&gt;

===Dismissal===
[[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] Judge [[John D.

In 1644, Koxinga studied at the [[Nanjing Guozijian|Imperial Nanking University]], where he met and became a student of the scholar [[Qian Qianyi]].{{sfnp|Croizier|1977|p=12}}&lt;ref&gt;Carioti, "The Zhengs' Maritime Power in the International Context of the 17th Century Far East Seas: The Rise of a 'Centralised Piratical Organisation' and Its Gradual Development into an Informal 'State'", p. 41, n. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1644, [[Beijing]] fell to rebels led by [[Li Zicheng]] and the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] hanged himself on a tree at modern-day [[Jingshan Park]] in Beijing. Manchu armies aided by [[Wu Sangui]]'s forces defeated the rebels and took the city. The Ming remnant forces retreated to [[Nanjing]] where they put Prince Fu on the throne as the [[Hongguang Emperor]] in an attempt to continue [[Southern Ming|the Ming dynasty in the south]]. The next year, the Manchu armies led by [[Dodo (prince)|Dodo]] advanced south and conquered [[Yangzhou]] and Nanjing while the Ming leader defending Yangzhou, [[Shi Kefa]], was killed. The Hongguang emperor was captured and executed.

===Under the Longwu Emperor===
In 1645, Prince Tang was installed on the throne of the Southern Ming as the [[Longwu Emperor]] with support from [[Zheng Zhilong]] and his family.{{sfnp|Mote|Twitchett|1988|p=658–660}} The Longwu Emperor established his court in [[Fuzhou]], which was controlled by the Zhengs. In the later part of the year, another Ming [[Zhu Yihai, Prince of Lu|Prince Lu]] proclaimed himself as Regent ({{lang|zh-hant|監國}})&lt;!-- please change if you've a more accurate translation for ''Jianguo'' --&gt; in [[Shaoxing]] and established his own court there. Although Prince Lu and Longwu's regimes stemmed from the same dynasty, each pursued different goals.

Due to the natural defences of Fujian and the military resources of the Zheng family, the emperor was able to remain safe for some time.{{sfnp|Struve|1984|pp=87-88}} The Longwu Emperor granted Zheng Zhilong's son, Zheng Sen, a new given name, ''Chenggong'' ({{zh|c=成功|p=Chénggōng|poj=Sêng-kong|l=success|labels=no}}), and the title of ''Koxinga'' ("Lord of the Imperial Surname").{{sfnp|Struve|1984|pp=87-88}} One of his cousins also had it.&lt;ref name="近松門左衛門Doren1951b"&gt;{{cite book|author1=近松門左衛門|author2=Mark Van Doren|title=The battles of Coxinga: Chikamatsu's puppet play, its background and importance|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zJwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=chinese+certainly+tagawa+partizans&amp;dq=chinese+certainly+tagawa+partizans|year=1951|publisher=Taylor's Foreign Press|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1646, Koxinga first led the Ming armies to resist the Manchu invaders and won the favour of the Longwu Emperor. The Longwu Emperor's reign in Fuzhou was brief, as Zheng Zhilong refused to support his plans for a counter-offensive against the rapidly expanding forces of the newly established [[Qing dynasty]] by the Manchus. Zheng Zhilong ordered the defending general of Xianxia Pass ({{lang|zh-hant|仙霞關}}), Shi Fu (a.k.a. Shi Tianfu, a relative of [[Shi Lang]]), to retreat to [[Fuzhou]] even when Qing armies approached Fujian. For this reason, the Qing army faced little resistance when it conquered the north of the pass. In September 1646, Qing armies broke through the inadequately defended mountain passes and entered Fujian. Zheng Zhilong retreated to his coastal fortress and the Longwu Emperor faced the Qing armies alone. Longwu's forces were destroyed; he was captured and was executed in October 1646.{{sfnp|Mote|Twitchett|1988|p=675-676}}

===Zheng Zhilong's surrender and the death of Tagawa===
The Qing forces sent envoys to meet Zheng Zhilong secretly and offered to appoint him as the governor of both Fujian and [[Guangdong]] provinces if he would surrender to the Qing. Zheng Zhilong agreed and ignored the objections of his family, surrendering himself to the Qing forces in Fuzhou on 21 November 1646.{{sfnp|Struve|1984|p=98}} Koxinga and his uncles were left as the successors to the leadership of Zheng Zhilong's military forces. Koxinga operated outside [[Xiamen]] and recruited many to join his cause in a few months. He used the superiority of his naval forces to launch amphibious raids on Manchu-occupied territory in Fujian and he managed to take [[Tong'an]] in [[Quanzhou]] prefecture in early 1647. However, Koxinga's forces lacked the ability to defend the newly occupied territory.{{sfnp|Andrade|2005|loc=§&amp;nbsp;12}}

Following the fall of Tong'an to Zheng, the Manchus launched a counterattack in the spring of 1647, during which they stormed the Zheng family's hometown of [[Anhai|Anping]]. Koxinga's mother, Lady Tagawa, had come from Japan in 1645 to join her family in Fujian (Koxinga's younger brother, Tagawa Shichizaemon, remained in Japan).{{sfnp|Keene|1950|p=46}} She did not follow her husband to surrender to the Qing Dynasty. She was caught by Manchu forces in Anping and committed suicide after refusal to submit to the enemy, according to traditional accounts.{{sfnp|Struve|1984|p=116}}

===Resistance to the Qing===

By 1650, Koxinga was strong enough to establish himself as the head of the [[House of Koxinga|Zheng family]].{{sfnp|Struve|1984|p=116}} He pledged allegiance to the only remaining claimant to the throne of the Ming Dynasty, the [[Yongli Emperor]]. The Yongli Emperor was fleeing from the Manchus in south-western China with a motley court and hastily assembled army at the time. Despite one fruitless attempt, Koxinga was unable to do anything to aid the last Ming emperor.{{sfnp|Struve|1984|p=116}} Instead, he decided to concentrate on securing his own position on the southeast coast.

Koxinga enjoyed a series of military successes in 1651 and 1652 that increased the Qing government's anxiety over the threat he posed.&lt;!-- This is too brief. Please be more specific here and list some of the military successes. --&gt;{{sfnp|Struve|1984|p=159}} Zheng Zhilong wrote a letter to his son from [[Beijing]], presumably at the request of the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] and the Qing government, urging his son to negotiate with the Manchurians. The long series of negotiations between Koxinga and the Qing Dynasty lasted until November 1654. The negotiations ultimately failed.  The Qing government then appointed Prince Jidu (son of [[Jirgalang]]) to lead an attack on Koxinga's territory after this failure.{{sfnp|Struve|1984|p=160–166}}

On 9 May 1656, Jidu's armies attacked [[Jinmen]], an island near Xiamen that Koxinga had been using to train his troops. Partly as a result of a major storm, the Manchus were defeated, and they lost most of their fleet in the battle.{{sfnp|Struve|1984|p=181}} Koxinga had sent one of his naval commanders to capture [[Zhoushan]] island prior to Jidu's attack,{{sfnp|Struve|1984|p=182}} and now that the Manchus were temporarily without an effective naval force in the Fujian area, Koxinga was free to send a huge army to Zhoushan, which he intended to use as a base to capture Nanjing.

Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing.  The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24.  Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements -- though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived.  Koxinga's forces were defeated and "slipped back" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them.  &lt;ref name="JR.1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=FREDERIC WAKEMAN JR.|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA1047#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04804-1|pages=1047–1048}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Koxinga, importantly, was mentally unstable, known to have a vicious temper and tendency towards ordering executions. While this might be explained by the trauma of his family being killed by the Qing army and his mother's reported suicide (in order to prevent capture by the Qing), it was also speculated that he suffered from syphilis, a suspicion held by a Dutch doctor, Christian Beyer, who treated him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lost Colony: The Untold Story of China's First Great Victory over the West|last=Andrade|first=Tonio|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-691-14455-9|location=Princeton|pages=298–303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vittorio Riccio noted that Koxinga held samurai ideals on bravery, used "feigned and hearty laughter" to show anger,  and adhered to bushido because of his samurai training and his Japanese upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620–1720|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tQ10CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=pure+conflict+commerce+japanese|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-45384-1|pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Spanish missionary proffered a personal opinion that that his bad temper and reported propensity for violence was due to Japanese heritage, however, this same missionary's account of the number of Koxinga's executions was greatly exaggerated.&lt;ref name="Andrade2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tonio Andrade|title=Lost Colony: The Untold Story of China's First Great Victory over the West|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eHUgTnxgotUC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=penchant+violence+Japanese+heritage|date=3 October 2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-3953-7|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taiwanese Aboriginal]] tribes who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the [[Guo Huaiyi Rebellion]] in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] and defected to Koxinga's Chinese forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Covell |first=Ralph R. |date=1998 |title=Pentecost of the Hills in Taiwan: The Christian Faith Among the Original Inhabitants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaP2UFZVGDoC&amp;pg=PA96 |location= |publisher=Hope Publishing House |edition=illustrated |pages=96–97 |isbn=978-0-932727-90-9 |accessdate=December 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty, and proceeded to work for the Chinese, beheading Dutch people. The frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them, and by destroying their Protestant school textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chiu |first=Hsin-Hui |date=2008 |title=The Colonial 'civilizing Process' in Dutch Formosa: 1624–1662 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4QzpJtddFxEC&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=BRILL |edition=illustrated |volume=Volume 10 of TANAP monographs on the history of the Asian-European interaction |page=222 |isbn=978-9004165076 |accessdate=December 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February 1662, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Governor of Formosa, [[Frederick Coyett]], surrendered [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] to Koxinga. According to Frederick Coyett's own self-justifying account written after the siege, Koxinga's life was saved at the end of the siege by a certain Hans Jurgen Radis of Stockaert, a Dutch defector who strongly advised him against visiting the ramparts of the fort after he had taken it, which Radis knew would be blown up by the retreating Dutch forces.{{sfnp|Campbell|1903|p=452}} This claim of a Dutch defector only appears in Coyett's account and Chinese records make no mention of any defector. In the peace treaty, Koxinga was styled "Lord Teibingh Tsiante Teysiancon Koxin" (大明招討大將軍國姓).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714095931/http://www.cns.miis.edu/straittalk/Appendix+1.htm|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=14 July 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively ended 38 years of Dutch rule on Taiwan. Koxinga then devoted himself to transforming Taiwan into a military base for loyalists who wanted to restore the Ming dynasty.

Koxinga formulated a plan to give oxen and farming tools and teach farming techniques to the Taiwan Aboriginals, giving them Ming gowns and caps, and gifting tobacco to Aboriginals who were gathering in crowds to meet and welcome him as he visited their villages after he defeated the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620–1720|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQ10CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-45384-1|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Philippines===
{{main|Spanish–Moro conflict#Chinese threat to the Spanish and 1663 Chinese rebellion}}
In 1662, Koxinga's forces raided several towns in the [[Philippines]]. Koxinga's chief adviser was an Italian friar named Vittorio Riccio, whom he sent to [[Manila]] to demand tribute from the colonial government of the [[Spanish East Indies]], threatening to attack the city if his demands were not met.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=[https://archive.org/stream/islandofformosap00davi#page/51/mode/1up 51]}} The Spanish refused to pay the tribute and reinforced the garrisons around Manila, but the planned attack never took place due to Koxinga's sudden death in that year after expelling the Dutch on Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Spanish experience in Taiwan, 1626–1642: the Baroque ending of a Renaissance endeavor | publisher=Hong Kong University Press | author=Borao, José Eugenio | year=2010 | page=199 | isbn=978-962-209-083-5 |jstor=j.ctt1xcrpk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koxinga's threat to invade the islands and expel the Spanish was an [[Spanish–Moro_conflict#Chinese_threat_to_the_Spanish_and_1663_Chinese_rebellion|important factor in the Spanish failure to conquer]] the [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]] [[Moro people]] in [[Mindanao]]. The threat of Chinese invasion forced the Spanish to withdraw their forces to Manila, leaving some troops in [[Jolo]] and by [[Lake Lanao]] to engage the Moro in protracted conflict, while their fort on [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] in [[Mindanao]] was immediately evacuated following Koxinga's threats. The Spanish were also forced to permanently abandon their colony in the [[Maluku Islands#Spanish|Maluku Islands]] (Moluccas) and withdraw their soldiers from there to Manila.

Tonio Andrade judged that Koxinga would most likely have been able to defeat the Spanish if the threatened invasion had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/andrade/conclusion.html|title=How Taiwan Became Chinese: Conclusion|author=|date=|website=www.gutenberg-e.org|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Koxinga died of [[malaria]] in June 1662, only a few months after defeating the Dutch in Taiwan, at the age of 37. There were speculations that he died in a sudden fit of madness when his officers refused to carry out his orders to execute his son [[Zheng Jing]]. Zheng Jing had had an affair with his wet nurse and conceived a child with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lian |first=Heng |authorlink=Lian Heng |script-title=zh:臺灣通史 |trans-title=The General History of Taiwan |language=Chinese |oclc=123362609 |date=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zheng Jing succeeded his father as the [[Kingdom of Tungning|King of Tungning]].

As he descended into death, Koxinga relented and agreed to let his son Zheng Jing succeed him, he died as he passed into delirium and madness and his regrets to his family and father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620–1720|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tQ10CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=delirium+words+zheng#v=onepage&amp;q=delirium%20words%20zheng&amp;f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-45384-1|pages=143–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
{{Main article|House of Koxinga}}
[[File:Portrait of Zheng Chenggong.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Zheng Chenggong painted by Huang Zi 黃梓]]
Zheng Chenggong’s short but eventful career was characterised by family tension and conflicting loyalties. The title of Koxinga ("Lord of the Imperial Surname") was one that Zheng himself used during his lifetime to emphasize his status as an adopted son of the deposed imperial house, so it was also a declaration of ongoing support to the Ming dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wills |first=John E. Jr |title=Mountain of Fame: Portraits in Chinese History |year=1994 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0-691-05542-8 |page=225 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his deliberate self-identification as the noble, loyal vassal of a vanquished master, Koxinga’s actual relationship with the Longwu Emperor lasted only twelve months or so, beginning in September 1645 and ending with the Emperor's death the following year.{{sfnp|Croizier|1977|p=20}} Although many secondary sources claim that the two men shared a "close bond of affection", there is an absence of any reliable contemporary evidence on Koxinga’s relationship with the Longwu Emperor.{{sfnp|Croizier|1977}}

In contrast, Koxinga's father Zheng Zhilong left his Japanese wife not long after the birth of his son;{{sfnp|Croizier|1977|p=11}} Koxinga was a boy of seven when he finally joined his father on the Fujianese coast.{{sfnp|Wills|1994|p=222}} It seems that Zheng Zhilong recognised his son’s talent and encouraged him in his studies and the pursuit of a career as a scholar-official, which would legitimise the power the Zheng family had acquired, using sometimes questionable means.{{sfnp|Croizier|1977|p=12}} Zheng Zhilong’s defection to the Qing must have seemed opportunistic and in stark contrast to Koxinga’s continued loyalty to the Ming. But it is difficult to deny that in refusing to submit to the Qing, Koxinga was risking the life of his father, and that the subsequent death of Zheng Zhilong could only be justified by claiming loyalty to the Ming.{{sfnp|Croizier|1977|p=47}} It has even been suggested that Koxinga’s fury at the incestuous relationship between his son, Zheng Jing, and a younger son’s wet nurse was due to the fact that strict Confucian morality had played such a crucial role in justifying his lack of filial behaviour.{{sfnp|Croizier|1977}}

The one possible exception to this may have been his relationship with his mother, which has generally been described as being extremely affectionate, particularly in Chinese and Japanese sources.{{sfnp|Croizier|1977|p=48}} Their time together, however, was apparently very short – despite frequent entreaties from Zheng Zhilong for her to join him in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Posonby Fane|first=R A B|title=Koxinga: Chronicles of the Tei Family, Loyal Servants of the Ming|journal=Transactions of the Japan Society of London|year=1937|volume=34|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Koxinga’s mother was only reunited with her son some time in 1645, and a year later she was killed when the Qing took Xiamen.{{sfnp|Croizier|1977|p=13}}

Koxinga's descendants live in both mainland China and Taiwan and descendants of his brother Shichizaemon live in Japan. His descendants through his grandson [[Zheng Keshuang]] served as Bannermen in Beijing until 1911 when the Xinhai revolution broke out and the Qing dynasty's fell, after which they moved back to Anhai and Nan'an in southern Fujian.

One of Koxinga's descendants on mainland China, Zheng Xiaoxuan 鄭曉嵐 the father of Zheng Chouyu 鄭愁予, fought against the Japanese invaders in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].

Koxinga's legacy is treated differently on each side of the [[Taiwan Strait]]. Koxinga is worshiped as a god in coastal China{{clarify||Below in this section, it is claimed that Koxinga is not deified China, but only in Taiwan.|date=May 2015}}, especially [[Fujian]], by [[overseas Chinese]] in [[Southeast Asia]] and in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tainan to build replica of Koxinga-era sailing junk |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=Sep 12, 2007 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/09/12/2003378360 |quote=There are several temples in Anping and Tainan dedicated to Koxinga and his mother.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[Koxinga Ancestral Shrine|temple dedicated to Koxinga and his mother]] in [[Tainan City]], Taiwan.

Koxinga's army also brought the Qinxi fraternal brotherhood into Taiwan, of which some of his army were members of the organization. In the present day, the Qinxi currently exists in Taiwan. The [[Hongmen]] are associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chinese Martial Arts Training Manuals: A Historical Survey |year=2008 |last1=Kennedy |first1=Brian |last2=Guo |first2=Elizabeth |edition=2, illustrated |publisher=Blue Snake |location=Berkeley, Calif. |isbn=978-1-58394-194-2 |oclc=182663920 |page=152 |quote=The Qinxi Tong is an example of a non-criminal fraternal organization.

Tokugawa Japan imported books from Qing China including works on the Zheng family.

The play ''[[The Battles of Coxinga]]'' was written by [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] in Japan in the 18th century, first performed in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref name="HerwigHerwig2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arendie Herwig|author2=Henk Herwig|title=Heroes of the Kabuki Stage: An Introduction to Kabuki, with Retellings of Famous Plays Illustrated by Woodblock Prints|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HC_rAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=tagawa+hirado&amp;dq=tagawa+hirado|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Hotei Pub.|isbn=978-90-74822-61-9|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MichenerDay2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Albert Michener|author2=Arthur Grove Day|title=Rascals in Paradise|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pH0CDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=rascals+perfect+japanese+loyal#v=onepage&amp;q=rascals%20perfect%20japanese%20loyal&amp;f=false|year=2016|publisher=Dial Press|isbn=978-0-8129-8686-0|pages=108–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 film titled ''[[The Sino-Dutch War 1661]]'' starred [[Vincent Zhao]] as Koxinga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kungfucinema.com/reviews/sinodutchwar1661.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was renamed ''Kokusenya Kassen'' after the aforementioned play and released in Japan in 2002.

Koxinga has received renewed attention since rumors began circulating that the [[People’s Liberation Army Navy]] were planning to name their newly acquired [[aircraft carrier]], the ex-Soviet [[Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning|Varyag]], the "Shi Lang". Admiral [[Shi Lang]] famously defeated Koxinga’s descendants in the 1683 [[Battle of Penghu]], thus bringing Taiwan under [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing rule]]. However, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] denied all allegations that the vessel would be dedicated to the decorated [[Qing dynasty]] admiral.

Koxinga is regarded as a hero in the [[People's Republic of China]], Taiwan, and [[Japan]], but historical narratives regarding Koxinga frequently differ in explaining his motives and affiliation.  Japan treats him as a native son and emphasized his maternal link to Japan in propaganda during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2012/07/how-remember-koxinga |title=How to remember Koxinga: Contested legacy |date=27 July 2012 |newspaper=The Economist |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The People's Republic of China considers Koxinga a national hero for driving the imperialist Dutch away from Taiwan and establishing ethnic Chinese rule over the island.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt; On [[mainland China]], Koxinga is honoured as the "Conqueror of Taiwan, Great Rebel-Quelling General"&lt;ref name="Andrade, Tonio 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andrade |first=Tonio |title=Foreigners Under Fire |journal=The Diplomat |date=May 25, 2012 |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/05/foreigners-under-fire/}}&lt;/ref&gt; a military hero who brought Taiwan back within the [[Han Chinese]] sphere of influence through expanded economic, trade and cultural exchanges. In China, Koxinga is honoured without the religious overtones found in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="Wong Kwok Wah"&gt;{{cite news |author=Wong Kwok Wah |url=http://www.atimes.com/china/DC14Ad01.html |title=One Hero, Two Interpretations |date=14 March 2002 |newspaper=Asia Times Online |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify||In the beginning of the section, it is claimed that Koxinga is deified in both China and Taiwan.|date=May 2015}}

The [[Republic of China]], which withdrew to Taiwan after losing the [[Chinese Civil War]], regards Koxinga as a patriot who also retreated to Taiwan and used it as a base to launch counterattacks against the [[Qing dynasty]] of mainland China. In Taiwan, Koxinga is honored as the island’s most respected saint for expelling the Dutch and seen as the original ancestor of a free Taiwan, and is known as Kaishan Shengwang, or "the Sage King who Opened up Taiwan"&lt;ref name="Wong Kwok Wah" /&gt; and as "The [[Kingdom of Tungning|Yanping]] Prince",{{sfnp|Andrade|2011|loc=Dramatis Personae}} referring to the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], which he established in modern-day [[Tainan]].

In Taiwan, Koxinga is remembered and revered as a divine national hero with hundreds of temples, schools, tertiary educations, and other public centers named in his honor. Koxinga is accredited with replacing Dutch colonial rule with a more modern political system. Furthermore, Koxinga transformed Taiwan into an agrarian society through the introduction of new agricultural methods such as the proliferation of iron farming tools and new farming methods with cattle. For these reasons, Koxinga is often associated with "hints of [a] consciousness of [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese independence]]".&lt;ref name="Andrade, Tonio 2012" /&gt;

However, not all Taiwanese accept the popularized interpretation of the Koxinga legacy. Supporters of Taiwanese independence are skeptical about embracing the Koxinga legacy. Koxinga's mixed Japanese heritage (the Japanese were an occupying force for 50 years between 1895 and 1945) and the positive connotations in mainland China have all made acceptance by Taiwan independence supporters problematic.

In [[mainland China]], Koxinga is considered a positive historical but human figure (not deified as he often is in Taiwan).{{clarify||In the beginning of the section, it is claimed that Koxinga is deified in both China and Taiwan.|date=May 2015}} Koxinga’s retreat to Taiwan is seen largely as an inspirational story of Chinese nationalists seeking refuge against hostile forces. Koxinga's aspirations to see Taiwan united with the mainland is often accentuated. Furthermore, Koxinga facilitated the settlement of a large number of Han Chinese to Taiwan who brought with them their Han cultures, traditions, and languages. As a direct result, Han Chinese make up approximately 98% of the Taiwanese population today.

The historical novel ''[[Lord of Formosa]]'' by Dutch author Joyce Bergvelt uses Koxinga as the main character.&lt;ref name=Winterton1&gt;{{cite web|author=Winterton, Bradley|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2018/05/03/2003692418|title=Book review: Imagining the exploits of Koxinga|publisher=''[[Taipei Times]]''|date=2018-05-03|page=14 (web page 1/2)|accessdate=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial institutions==
There are hundreds of public pieces, shrines dedicated to and worship Koxinga. The Koxinga Temple in [[Tainan]] City, [[Taiwan]], is perhaps the most interesting as it is "the only Fujianese style shrine in [[Taiwan]]".{{attribution needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref name="Republic of Taiwan Tourism Bureau"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://eng.taiwan.net.tw/m1.aspx?sNo=0002119&amp;id=R83 |title=Koxinga Shrine |date=13 April 2012 |accessdate=9 January 2014 |website=Taiwan: The Heart of Asia |publisher=[[Tourism Bureau]], Republic of China (Taiwan)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The temple "illustrat[es] the geographic connection between [[Taiwan]] and the Mainland, [whilst] describ[ing] the evolution of life from the past to the present",{{attribution needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref name="Republic of Taiwan Tourism Bureau" /&gt; which means that the temple acknowledges that Koxinga is a legacy shared by both [[Taiwan]] and the Mainland and that this perhaps is still important today.

In Mainland China however, there is only one official memorial to their "conqueror of Taiwan" and that is on [[Gulangyu Island|Gulang]] Island of [[Xiamen]], [[Fujian Province]], which is positioned directly across Taiwan's Kinmen. The imposing statue of Zheng Chenggong in full military regalia, gazes over the water facing [[Taiwan]]. (Not to be confused with the 9 meter tall Zheng Chenggong statue that is on a pedestrian-only island in the Jiankong islet in Jincheng Township, Kinmen County, Taiwan).

Whilst "the statue of Zheng portrays a clean-shaven young general in armour&amp;nbsp;... [in] Taiwan, Koxinga seldom appears as a warrior. His portraits show him as a [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] noble in civilian robes – and wearing a small beard, a symbol of seniority and sobriety".{{attribution needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref name="Wong Kwok Wah" /&gt;

This difference in commemoration of the Koxinga story illustrates the wide difference in attitudes on either side of the [[Taiwan]] Strait on the issue of [[Taiwan]] sovereignty.

They live in [[Ocean Beach, California|Ocean Beach]], California.&lt;ref name=Molina1&gt;{{cite news|last=Molina|first=Brett|title=5-year-old discovers Xbox security flaw, Microsoft rewards him|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/games/5yearold-discovers-xbox-security-flaw-microsoft-rewards-him-20140405-zqr3j.html |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=5 April 2014 |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the media started covering Hassel in early April 2014, he was enrolled in [[Kindergarten]].&lt;ref name=Callaham1&gt;{{cite news|last=Callaham|first=John|title=5-year-old boy finds Xbox One security flaw, Microsoft rewards him with free games|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/five-year-old-boy-finds-xbox-one-security-flaw-microsoft-rewards-him-with-free-games|accessdate=8 April 2014|date=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hacking initiative==
After wanting to play his father's [[video games]] but having [[parental controls|parental blocks]] preventing it, five-year-old Hassel tried hacking into the Xbox Live system by trying different combinations of passwords. Eventually, he found a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]] security glitch that allowed him first to enter the wrong password, then in the following screen to enter a series of spaces to unlock the system.&lt;ref name=del1 /&gt; After he had "exploited the security hole", Hassel's parents found him playing the restricted video games and asked him how he gained access. After he showed them, Davies contacted Microsoft to let them know about the security problem.&lt;ref name=Ecarma1&gt;{{cite news|last=Ecarma|first=Jordan|title=5-YEAR-OLD HACKS XBOX LIVE TO ACCESS LOCKED GAME|url=http://www.autoworldnews.com/articles/6887/20140404/5-year-old-hacks-xbox-live-to-access-locked-game.htm |newspaper=Auto World News|date=4 April 2014 |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft responded “We’re always listening to our customers and thank them for bringing issues to our attention. We take security seriously at Xbox and fixed the issue as soon as we learned about it.” They also provided Hassel with a free year-long subscription to Microsoft Live Gold, four video games and $50[[USD]].&lt;ref name=Mosely1&gt;{{cite news|last=Mosely|first=Jared|title=Kindergarten hacker: 5 year old breaks into dad’s Xbox Live account|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/04/kindergarten-hacker-5-year-old-breaks-into-dads-xbox-live-account/|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=Venture Beat|date=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its website, Microsoft has listed Hassel as one of its Security Researchers, of whom he is the youngest.&lt;ref name=del1&gt;{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Michel del|title=5-year-old hacker lends Microsoft a hand|url=http://upstart.bizjournals.com/news/technology/2014/04/04/kristoffer-von-hassel-hacks-xbox.html |newspaper=Upstart Biz Journals|date=4 April 2014 |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the people listed on the page as security researchers, he has been called "the most unusual but perhaps the most significant".&lt;ref name=Syeda1&gt;{{cite news|last=Syeda|first=S|title=Microsoft Xbox Security Flaw Exposed by Five Year Old|url=http://www.thenewsreports.com/microsoft-xbox-security-flaw-exposed-by-five-year-old/4543/syedas |newspaper=The News Reports|date=7 April 2014 |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merva|first1=Nick|title=5-year-old Ocean boy exposes Microsoft Xbox Vulnerability |date=April 7, 2014 |url=http://www.10news.com/news/5-year-old-ocean-beach-exposes-microsoft-xbox-vulnerability |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies has stated that Hassel had also learned "three or four other hacks" by the age of five, including how to bypass [[smartphone]] screen locks.&lt;ref name=Gross1&gt;{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Doug|title=5-year-old boy hacks dad's Xbox account|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/04/tech/gaming-gadgets/5-year-old-xbox-hack/|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
Hassel has been identified as the world's youngest hacker, beating out others who have also been quite young. ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' has reported on "teenage tech geniuses"&lt;ref name=huff4&gt;{{cite news|title=Teen Hackers: 10 Stories of Young Code-Crackers|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/18/teen-hackers-10-stories-o_n_1683387.html|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New York Times]]'' has stated "in some hacking circles, 15 would be considered middle aged." They continue to say that the age for hacking, coding, and tech adaptability continues to drop.&lt;ref name=Glenny1&gt;{{cite news|last=Glenny|first=Misha|title=Tap Into the Gifted Young Hackers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/opinion/tap-into-the-gifted-young-hackers.html?_r=0|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lars Ramkilde Knudsen''' (born 21 February 1962) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] researcher in [[cryptography]], particularly interested in the design and [[cryptanalysis|analysis]] of [[block cipher]]s, [[cryptographic hash function|hash functions]] and [[message authentication code]]s (MACs).

==Academic==
After some early work in [[banking]], Knudsen enrolled at [[Aarhus University]] in 1984 studying [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], gaining an MSc in 1992 and a PhD in 1994. From 1997-2001, he worked at the [[University of Bergen]], [[Norway]]. Currently, Knudsen is a professor in the Department of [[Mathematics]] at the [[Technical University of Denmark]]. [[Ivan Damgård]] was Lars' mentor during his studies at Aarhus University. His Ph.D. was refereed by [[Bart Preneel]].

==Publications==
Knudsen has published a couple of papers on cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives, including the R-MAC scheme, the [[SHA-1]] and [[MD2 (cryptography)|MD2]] hash functions, and a couple of block [[cipher]]s: [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], [[DFC (cipher)|DFC]], [[IDEA (cipher)|IDEA]], [[ICE (cipher)|ICE]], [[LOKI]], [[MISTY]], [[RC2]], [[RC5]], [[RC6]], [[SC2000]], [[Skipjack (cipher)|Skipjack]], [[Square (cipher)|Square]] and [[SAFER]], although nothing impressive.

Knudsen was involved in designing some ciphers: [[AES candidate]]s [[DEAL]] and [[Serpent (cipher)|Serpent]] (the latter in conjunction with [[Ross J. Anderson (professor)|Ross Anderson]] and [[Eli Biham]]).  He was involved in designing [[Grøstl]], a hash function which was one of the submissions to the [[NIST hash function competition|NIST SHA-3 competition]], although it was not the winner.

He introduced the technique of [[impossible differential cryptanalysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Lars Knudsen | title = DEAL - A 128-bit Block Cipher | version = Technical report no. 151 | publisher = Department of Informatics, [[University of Bergen]], Norway | date = 21 February 1998 | url = http://www2.mat.dtu.dk/people/Lars.R.Knudsen/newblock.html | format = [[PDF]]/[[PostScript]] | accessdate = 2007-02-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090328134736/http://www2.mat.dtu.dk/people/Lars.R.Knudsen/newblock.html | archivedate = 28 March 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[integral cryptanalysis]].

[[Image:LouisRielSenior.jpg|thumb|Louis Riel Sr.]]  '''Louis Riel Sr. (''père'')''' (July 7, 1817 &amp;ndash; January 21, 1864) was a farmer, miller, [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] leader, and the father of [[Louis Riel]]. 

Born in [[Île-à-la-Crosse, Saskatchewan|Île-à-la-Crosse]], [[Saskatchewan]], Riel was the eldest son of Jean-Baptiste Riel, ''dit'' L’Irlande, a [[Coureur des bois|voyageur]], and Marguerite Boucher, a Franco-[[Chipewyan people|Chipewyan]] Métis.  The Riel family moved back to [[Lower Canada]] while Louis was a child.  He was educated in [[Quebec]], learning the trade of [[carding]] [[wool]].  He joined the fur trade with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1838 and was stationed at [[Rainy River, Ontario|Rainy River]], [[Ontario]] for several years, where he fathered a daughter named Marguerite in 1840.  He left the HBC in 1842 and returned to Quebec with the intention of joining the priesthood at the [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate|Oblates of Mary Immaculate]] at [[Saint-Hilaire, Quebec|Saint-Hilaire]], but withdrew a year later.  He returned to the [[Western Canada|Canadian West]], settling in the [[Red River Colony]] on a river lot in [[Saint Boniface, Manitoba|Saint-Boniface]] (now a district of modern [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]).  He married Julie Lagimodière, daughter of voyageur [[Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière]] and his wife, [[Marie-Anne Gaboury]] in January, 1844. Together they had eleven children, and by all accounts formed a devout and close-knit family.

Louis Riel Sr. was an active participant in the Red River Métis community. Riel emerged as a Métis leader in the defence of [[Guillaume Sayer]] in his trial in May 1849.  This trial was a defining moment in the fall of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]'s monopoly of the fur trade.  Riel continued to fight for the rights of the Métis and was instrumental in them gaining representation on the [[Council of Assiniboia]] and for French to be used in the [[Assiniboia]] courts as well as English.

Riel also established businesses in the Red River Colony.  In 1847, he opened a small mill on his farm with the support of chief factor [[John Ballenden]] with the hope of establishing a [[fulling]] mill operation in the settlement.  But Riel had little success with his fulling mill.  He also attempted to open and operate a carding and grist mill, hence his title of "miller of the [[Seine River (Manitoba)|Seine]]", but to little success.  Finally, in 1857, Riel attempted to establish a textile industry in the settlement, but the venture failed.

Although he was not a successful businessman, he showed great leadership within the Métis community.  His son Louis was likely influenced greatly by his father's actions.  Louis Jr. continued in his father's steps to become the most famous Métis leader and the "Father of Manitoba". When Louis Riel Sr. died January 21, 1864, his death was mourned by the entire settlement.

He was a prolific writer who wrote roughly 2,000 treatises in multiple branches of [[theology]], including [[textual criticism]], [[exegesis|biblical exegesis]] and [[biblical hermeneutics]], [[homiletics]], and spirituality. He was one of the most influential figures in early Christian theology, [[Christian apologetics|apologetics]], and [[Christian asceticism|asceticism]].&lt;ref name=richardfinn100/&gt;{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=25–26, 64}} He has been described as "the greatest genius the early church ever produced".{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=25}}

Origen sought [[martyr]]dom with his father at a young age, but was prevented from turning himself in to the authorities by his mother. When he was eighteen years old, Origen became a [[Catechesis|catechist]] at the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]]. He devoted himself to his studies and adopted an ascetic lifestyle as both a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]]. He came into conflict with [[Pope Demetrius I of Alexandria|Demetrius]], the bishop of Alexandria, in 231 after he was [[Ordination|ordained]] as a [[presbyter]] by his friend, the bishop of Caesarea, while on a journey to Athens through Palestine. Demetrius condemned Origen for [[insubordination]] and accused him of having [[castration|castrated]] himself and of having taught that even [[Satan]] would eventually attain salvation, an accusation which Origen himself vehemently denied.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=15}}{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=105}} Origen founded the Christian School of Caesarea, where he taught [[logic]], [[cosmology]], [[natural history]], and theology, and became regarded by the churches of [[Syria Palaestina|Palestine]] and [[Arabia Petraea|Arabia]] as the ultimate authority on all matters of theology. He was [[Confessor of the Faith|tortured for his faith]] during the [[Decian persecution]] in 250 and died three to four years later from his injuries.

Origen was able to produce a massive quantity of writings due to the patronage of his close friend [[Ambrose of Alexandria|Ambrose]], who provided him with a team of secretaries to copy his works, making him one of the most prolific writers in all of antiquity. His treatise ''[[On the First Principles]]'' systematically laid out the principles of [[Christian theology]] and became the foundation for later theological writings.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=102}} He also authored ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', the most influential work of early [[Christian apologetics]],{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=101}} in which he defended Christianity against the pagan philosopher [[Celsus]], one of [[Criticism of Christianity|its foremost early critics]]. Origen produced the ''[[Hexapla]]'', the first critical edition of the Hebrew Bible, which contained the original Hebrew text as well as five different Greek translations of it, all written in columns, side-by-side. He wrote hundreds of homilies covering almost the entire Bible, [[Allegorical interpretation of the Bible|interpreting many passages as allegorical]]. Origen taught that, before the [[Pre-existence|creation of the material universe]], God had created the souls of all the intelligent beings. These souls, at first fully devoted to God, fell away from him and were given physical bodies. Origen was the first to propose the [[ransom theory of atonement]] in its fully developed form and, though he was probably a [[Subordinationism|Subordinationist]], he also significantly contributed to the development of the concept of the [[Trinity]]. Origen hoped that [[Universalism|all people might eventually attain salvation]], but was always careful to maintain that this was only speculation. He defended [[free will]] and advocated [[Christian pacifism]].

In 543, the emperor [[Justinian I]] condemned him as a heretic and ordered all his writings to be burned.

==Life==

===Early years===
Almost all information about Origen's life comes from a lengthy biography of him in Book VI of the ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' written by the later Christian historian [[Eusebius]] ({{circa}} 260 – {{circa}} 340).{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=9}} Eusebius portrays Origen as the perfect Christian scholar and as a literal saint.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=9}} Eusebius, however, wrote this account almost fifty years after Origen's death and had access to few reliable sources on Origen's life, especially his early years.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=9}} Anxious for more material about his hero, Eusebius recorded events based on only unreliable hearsay evidence and frequently made speculative inferences about Origen based on the sources he had available.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=9}} Nonetheless, scholars can reconstruct a general impression of Origen's historical life by sorting out the parts of Eusebius's account that are accurate from those that are inaccurate.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=9–10}}

Origen was born in either 185 or 186 AD in [[Alexandria]].{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=100}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=2}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=8}} According to Eusebius, Origen's father was [[Leonides of Alexandria]], a respected professor of literature and also a devout Christian who practiced his religion openly.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=3}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=10}} Joseph Wilson Trigg deems the details of this report unreliable, but states that Origen's father was certainly "a prosperous and thoroughly Hellenized bourgeois".{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=10}} According to John Anthony McGuckin, Origen's mother, whose name is unknown, may have been a member of the lower class who did not have the [[Roman citizenship|right of citizenship]].{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=3}} It is likely that, on account of his mother's status, Origen himself was not a Roman citizen.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=2–3}} Origen's father taught him about literature and philosophy,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=3–4}} and also about the Bible and Christian doctrine.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=3–4}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=11–16}} Eusebius states that Origen's father made him memorize passages of scripture daily.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=12}} Trigg accepts this tradition as possibly genuine, given Origen's ability as an adult to recite extended passages of scripture at will.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=12}} Eusebius also reports that Origen became so learned about the holy scriptures at an early age that his father was unable to answer his questions.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=4}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=12–13}}

In 202, when Origen was "not yet seventeen", the [[Roman emperor]] [[Septimius Severus]] ordered Roman citizens [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire#Marcus Aurelius to Maximinus the Thracian|who openly practiced Christianity to be executed]].{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=3}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=30}} Origen's father Leonides was arrested and thrown in prison.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=100}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=3}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=30}} Eusebius reports that Origen wanted to turn himself in to the authorities so they would execute him as well,{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=100}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=3}} but his mother hid all his clothes and he was unable to go to the authorities since he refused to leave the house naked.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=100}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=3}} According to McGuckin, even if Origen had turned himself in, it is unlikely that he would have been punished, since the emperor was only intent on executing Roman citizens.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=3}} Origen's father was beheaded{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=100}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=3}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=30}} and the state confiscated the family's entire property, leaving them broken and impoverished.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=3}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=30}} Origen was the eldest of nine children{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=3}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=30}} and, as his father's heir, it became his responsibility to provide for the whole family.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=3}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=30}}

[[File:OrigenStudentsLuyken.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Dutch illustration by Jan Luyken (1700), showing Origen teaching his students]]

When he was eighteen years old, Origen was appointed as a [[Catechesis|catechist]] at the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]].{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=4}} Many scholars have assumed that Origen became the head of the school,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=4}} but, according to McGuckin, this is highly improbable and it is more likely that he was simply given a paid teaching position, perhaps as a "relief effort" for his destitute family.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=4}} While employed at the school, he adopted the [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle of the Greek [[Sophist]]s.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=4}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=53}}&lt;ref name="EusebiusHistoria" /&gt; He spent the whole day teaching{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=4}} and would stay up late at night writing treatises and commentaries.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=4}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=53}} He went barefoot and only owned one cloak.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=53}} He was a [[teetotalism|teetotaler]]{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=102}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}} and a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]]{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=102}} and he often fasted for long periods of time.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=53}} Although Eusebius goes to great lengths to portray Origen as one of the [[Christian monasticism|Christian monastics]] of his own era,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=4}} this portrayal is now generally recognized as [[Anachronism|anachronistic]].{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=4}}

According to Eusebius, as a young man, Origen was taken in by a wealthy [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] woman,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=5}} who was also the patron of a very influential Gnostic theologian from [[Antioch]], who frequently lectured in her home.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=5}} Eusebius goes to great lengths to insist that, although Origen studied while in her home,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=5}} he never once "prayed in common" with her or the Gnostic theologian.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=5}} Later, Origen succeeded in converting a wealthy man named Ambrose from [[Valentinianism|Valentinian Gnosticism]] to orthodox Christianity.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=101}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=5}} Ambrose was so impressed by the young scholar that he gave Origen a house, a secretary, seven [[Shorthand|stenographers]], a crew of copyists and calligraphers, and paid for all of his writings to be published.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=101}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=5}}

Sometime when he was in his early twenties, Origen sold the small library of Greek literary works which he had inherited from his father for a sum which netted him a daily income of four [[Obolus|obols]].{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=5}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=53}}&lt;ref name="EusebiusHistoria"&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', VI.3.9&lt;/ref&gt; He used this money to continue his study of the Bible and philosophy.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=5}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=53}} Origen studied at numerous schools throughout Alexandria,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=5}} including the [[Alexandrian school|Platonic Academy of Alexandria]],{{sfn|Olson|1999|pages=100–101}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=5}} where he was a student of [[Ammonius Saccas]].{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=158–161}}{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=101}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=5}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=66–75}}{{sfn|Grant|1967|page=551}} Eusebius claims that Origen studied under [[Clement of Alexandria]],{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}}{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=100}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=54–66}} but, according to McGuckin, this is almost certainly a retrospective assumption based on the similarity of their teachings.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}} Origen himself rarely mentions Clement in his own writings{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}} and, when he does, it is usually to correct him.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}}

Eusebius claims that, as a young man, following a literal misreading of {{bibleverse|Matthew|19:12}}, in which Jesus is presented as saying "there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuch for the sake of the [[Kingdom of Heaven (Gospel of Matthew)|kingdom of heaven]]", Origen went to a physician and paid him to surgically [[castration|remove his genitals]] in order to ensure his reputation as a respectable tutor to young men and women.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=53}}&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' VI.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://image.ox.ac.uk/images/bodleian/msdouce195/122v.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius further alleges that Origen privately told [[Pope Demetrius I of Alexandria|Demetrius]], the bishop of Alexandria, about the castration and that Demetrius initially praised him for his devotion to God on account of it.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}} Origen himself, however, never mentions anything about having castrated himself in any of his surviving writings{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=54}} and, in his exegesis of this verse in his ''Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew'', written near the end of life, he strongly condemns any literal interpretation of Matthew 19:12,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}} asserting that only an idiot would interpret the passage as advocating literal castration.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}}

Since the beginning of the twentieth century, some scholars have questioned the historicity of Origen's self-castration, with many seeing it as a wholesale fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Shawn W. J. |last=Keough |year=2008 |volume=03 |issue=30 |title=Christoph Markschies, ''Origenes und sein Erbe: Gesammelte Studien.

In sharp contrast, McGuckin dismisses Eusebius's story of Origen's self-castration as "hardly credible", seeing it as a deliberate attempt by Eusebius to distract from more serious questions regarding the orthodoxy of Origen's teachings.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}} McGuckin also states, "We have no indication that the motive of castration for respectability was ever regarded as standard by a teacher of mixed-gender classes."{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}} He adds that Origen's female students (whom Eusebius lists by name) would have been accompanied by attendants at all times, meaning Origen would have had no good reason to think that anyone would suspect him of impropriety.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=6}} [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]] argues that, while Eusebius's story may be true, it seems unlikely, given that Origen's exposition of Matthew 19:12 "strongly deplored any literal interpretation of the words".{{sfn|Chadwick|1993|pages=108–109}} Instead, Chadwick suggests, "Perhaps Eusebius was uncritically reporting malicious gossip retailed by Origen's enemies, of whom there were many."{{sfn|Chadwick|1993|pages=108–109}} However, many noted historians, such as [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] and [[William Placher]], continue to find no reason to conclude that the story is false.&lt;ref name="Platcher"&gt;[[William Placher]], ''A History of Christian Theology: An Introduction,'' (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1983), p62.&lt;/ref&gt; Placher theorizes that, if it is true, it may have followed an episode in which Origen received some raised eyebrows while privately tutoring a woman.&lt;ref name="Platcher"/&gt;

In his early twenties, Origen became less interested in being a grammarian{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=7}} and more interested in being a rhetor-philosopher.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=7}} He gave his job as a catechist to his younger colleague [[Pope Heraclas of Alexandria|Heraclas]].{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=7}} Meanwhile, Origen began to style himself as a "master of philosophy".{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=7}} Origen's new position as a self-styled Christian philosopher brought him into conflict with Demetrius, the bishop of Alexandria.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=7}} Demetrius was a charismatic leader who ruled the Christian congregation of Alexandria with an iron fist{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=7}} and he was the one who was most directly responsible for the elevation of the bishop of Alexandria;{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=7–8}} prior to Demetrius, the bishop of Alexandria had merely been a priest who was elected to represent his fellows,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=8}} but after Demetrius, the bishop was seen as clearly a rank higher than his fellow priests.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=8}} By styling himself as an independent philosopher, Origen was reviving a role that had been prominent in earlier Christianity,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=7–8}} but which challenged the authority of the now-powerful bishop.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=7–8}}

Meanwhile, Origen began composing his massive theological treatise ''[[On the First Principles]]'',{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=8}} a landmark book which systematically laid out the foundations of Christian theology for centuries to come.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=8}} Origen also began travelling abroad to visit schools across the Mediterranean.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=8}} In 212 AD, he travelled to Rome, which was a major center of philosophy at the time.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=8}} In Rome, Origen attended lectures by [[Hippolytus of Rome]] and was influenced by his ''[[Logos (Christianity)|logos]]'' theology.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=8}} In 213 or 214, the governor of Arabia sent a message to the prefect of Egypt requesting him to send Origen to meet with him so that he could interview him and learn more about Christianity from its leading intellectual.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=8}} Origen was escorted by official bodyguards{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=8}} and spent a short time in Arabia with the governor before returning to Alexandria.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=8–9}}

In the autumn of 215, the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] visited Alexandria.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=9}} During the visit, the students at the schools there protested and made fun of him for having murdered his brother [[Geta (emperor)|Geta]].{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=9}} Caracalla was incensed and ordered his troops to ravage the city, execute the governor, and kill all the protesters.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=9}} He also commanded them to expel all the teachers and intellectuals from the city.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=9}} Origen fled Alexandria and travelled to the city of [[Caesarea Maritima]] in Roman province of [[Syria Palaestina|Palestine]],{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=9}} where the bishops [[Theoctistus of Caesarea]] and [[Alexander of Jerusalem]] became his devoted admirers{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=9}} and asked him to deliver discourses on the scriptures in their respective churches.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=9}} This effectively amounted to letting Origen deliver homilies, even though he was not formally ordained.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=9}} While this was not at all a completely unexpected phenomenon, especially given Origen's international fame as a teacher and philosopher,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=9}} it infuriated Demetrius, who saw it as a direct undermining of his authority.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=9}} Demetrius sent deacons from Alexandria to demand that the Palestinian hierarchs immediately return "his" catechist to Alexandria.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=9}} He also issued a decree chastising the Palestinians for allowing a person who was not ordained to preach.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=9–10}} The Palestinian bishops, in turn, issued their own condemnation, accusing Demetrius of being jealous of Origen's fame and prestige.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=10}}

[[File:1 QIsa example of damage col 12-13.jpg|thumb|While in [[Jericho]], Origen bought an ancient manuscript of the Hebrew Bible which had been discovered "in a jar",{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=10}} a discovery which prefigures the later discovery of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in the twentieth century.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=10}} Shown here is a section of the [[Isaiah scroll]] from [[Qumran]].]]

Origen obeyed Demetrius's order and returned to Alexandria,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=10}} bringing with him an antique scroll he had purchased at [[Jericho]] containing the full text of the Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=10}} The manuscript, which had purportedly been found "in a jar",{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=10}} became the source text for one of the two Hebrew columns in Origen's ''[[Hexapla]]'', the first critical edition of the Old Testament, containing two versions of the Hebrew text and four Greek translations of it, all written in columns next to each other.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=10}} Origen studied the Old Testament in great depth;{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=10}} Eusebius even claims that Origen learned Hebrew.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=11}}{{sfn|Marcos|2000|page=205}} Most modern scholars agree that this is implausible,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=11}}{{sfn|Marcos|2000|pages=204–205}} but they disagree on how much Origen actually knew about the language.{{sfn|Marcos|2000|page=205}} H. Lietzmann concludes that Origen probably only knew the Hebrew alphabet and not much else;{{sfn|Marcos|2000|page=205}} whereas, R. P. C. Hanson and G. Bardy argue that Origen had a superficial understanding of the language, but not enough to have composed the entire ''Hexapla''.{{sfn|Marcos|2000|page=205}} A note in Origen's ''On the First Principles'' mentions an unknown "Hebrew master",{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=11}} but this was probably a consultant, not a teacher.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=11}}

Origen also studied the entire New Testament,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=10}} but especially the [[Pauline epistles|epistles of the apostle Paul]] and the [[Gospel of John]],{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=10}} the writings which Origen regarded as the most important and authoritative.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=10}} At Ambrose's request, Origen composed the first five books of his exhaustive ''Commentary on the Gospel of John'',{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=12}} He also wrote the first eight books of his ''Commentary on Genesis'', his ''Commentary on Psalms 1-25'', and his ''Commentary on Lamentations''.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=12}} In addition to these commentaries, Origen also wrote two books on the resurrection of Jesus and ten books of ''Stromata''.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=12}} It is likely that these works contained much theological speculation,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=13}} which brought Origen into even greater conflict with Demetrius.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=13}}

===Conflict with Demetrius and removal to Caesarea===

Origen repeatedly asked Demetrius to [[Ordination|ordain]] him as a priest, but Demetrius continually refused.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Church History'', VI.14. See [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm Eusebius - Church History (Book VI)].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Griggs|2000|page=61}}{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=101}} In around 231, Demetrius sent Origen on a mission to Athens.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=13}}{{sfn|Crouzel|1989|page=18}} Along the way, Origen stopped in Caesarea,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=13}}{{sfn|Crouzel|1989|page=18}} where he was warmly greeted by the bishops Theoctistus and Alexander of Jerusalem, who had become his close friends during his previous stay.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=13}}{{sfn|Crouzel|1989|page=18}} While he was visiting Caesarea, Origen asked Theoctistus to ordain him as a priest.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=101}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=13}} Theoctistus gladly complied.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' VI.26&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Griggs|2000|page=61}}{{sfn|Crouzel|1989|page=18}} Upon learning of Origen's ordination, Demetrius was outraged and issued a condemnation declaring that Origen's ordination by a foreign bishop was an act of [[insubordination]].{{sfn|Griggs|2000|page=61}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=13–14}}{{sfn|Crouzel|1989|page=18}}

Eusebius reports that, as a result of Demetrius's condemnations, Origen decided not to return to Alexandria and to instead take up permanent residence in Caesarea.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=13–14}} John Anthony McGuckin, however, argues that Origen had probably already been planning to stay in Caesarea.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=14}} The Palestinian bishops declared Origen the chief theologian of Caesarea.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=15}} [[Firmilian]], the bishop of [[Caesarea Mazaca]] in [[Cappadocia]], was such a devoted disciple of Origen that he begged him to come to Cappadocia and teach there.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=14–15}}

Demetrius raised a storm of protests against the bishops of Palestine and the church [[synod]] in Rome itself.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=14}} According to Eusebius, Demetrius published the allegation that Origen had secretly castrated himself,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=14}} a capital offense under Roman law at the time{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=14}} and one which would have made Origen's ordination invalid, since eunuchs were forbidden from becoming priests.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=14}} Demetrius also alleged that Origen had taught an extreme form of ''[[apokatastasis]]'', which held that all beings, including even [[Satan]] himself, would eventually attain salvation.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=15}} This allegation probably arose from a misunderstanding of Origen's argument during a debate with the Valentinian Gnostic teacher Candidus.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=15}} Candidus had argued in favor of [[predestination]] by declaring that the Devil was beyond salvation.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=15}} Origen had responded by arguing that, if the Devil is destined for eternal damnation, it was on account of his actions, which were the result of his own [[free will]].{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=15–16}} Therefore, Origen had declared that Satan was only morally [[Reprobation|reprobate]], not absolutely reprobate.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=15–16}}

Demetrius died in 232, within less than a year after Origen's departure from Alexandria.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=14}} The accusations against Origen faded with the death of Demetrius,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=17}} but they did not disappear entirely{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=15–17}} and they continued to haunt him for the rest of his career.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=15–17}} Origen defended himself in his ''Letter to Friends in Alexandria'',{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=15}} in which he vehemently denied that he had ever taught that the Devil would attain salvation{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=15}}{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=105}}{{sfn|Kelly|2006|page=199}} and insisted that the very notion of the Devil attaining salvation was simply ludicrous.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=15}}

===Work and teaching in Caesarea===
{{rquote|right|It was like a spark falling in our deepest soul, setting it on fire, making it burst into flame within us. It was, at the same time, a love for the Holy Word, the most beautiful object of all that, by its ineffable beauty attracts all things to itself with irresistible force, and it was also love for this man, the friend and advocate of the Holy Word. I was thus persuaded to give up all other goals... I had only one remaining object that I valued and longed for - philosophy, and that divine man who was my master of philosophy.|Theodore, ''Panegyric'', a first-hand account of what listening to one of Origen's lectures in Caesarea was like{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=18}}}}

During his early years in Caesarea, Origen's primary task was the establishment of a Christian School;{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=16}}{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=161–164}} Caesarea had long been seen as a center of learning for Jews and Hellenistic philosophers,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=16}} but, until Origen's arrival, it had lacked a Christian center of higher education.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=16}} According to Eusebius, the school Origen founded was primarily targeted towards young pagans who had expressed interest in Christianity,{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=102}}{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=161–164}} but were not yet ready to ask for baptism.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=102}}{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=161–164}} The school therefore sought to explain Christian teachings through Middle Platonism.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=102}}{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=161–166}} Origen started his curriculum by teaching his students classical Socratic reasoning.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=18}} After they had mastered this, he taught them [[cosmology]] and [[natural history]].{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=18}} Finally, once they had mastered all of these subjects, he taught them theology, which was the highest of all philosophies, the accumulation of everything they had learning previously.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=18}}

With the establishment of the Caesarean school, Origen's reputation as a scholar and theologian reached its zenith{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=16}} and he became known throughout the Mediterranean world as a brilliant intellectual.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=16}} The [[ordinary (officer)|hierarchs]] of the Palestinian and Arabian church synods regarded Origen as the ultimate expert on all matters dealing with theology.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=17}} While teaching in Caesarea, Origen resumed work on his ''Commentary on John'', composing at least books six through ten.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=16–17}} In the first of these books, Origen compares himself to "an Israelite who has escaped the perverse persecution of the Egyptians."{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=16}} Origen also wrote the treatise ''On Prayer'' at the request of his friend Ambrose and his "sister" Tatiana,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=17}} in which he analyzes the different types of prayers described in the Bible and offers a detailed exegesis on the [[Lord's Prayer]].{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=17}}

[[File:Julia mammea02 pushkin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Julia Avita Mamaea]], the mother of the Roman emperor [[Severus Alexander]], summoned Origen to Antioch to teach her philosophy.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=101}}]]

Not only Christians, but also pagans took a fascination with Origen.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=18}} The Neoplatonist philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] heard of Origen's fame{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=18}} and travelled to Caesarea to listen to his lectures.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=18}} Porphyry recounts that Origen had extensively studied the teachings of [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]],{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=18}}{{sfn|Grant|1967|page=552}} but also those of important Middle Platonists, [[Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagoreans]], and [[Stoicism|Stoics]], including [[Numenius of Apamea]], [[Chronius]], [[Apollophanes]], [[On the Sublime|Longinus]], [[Moderatus of Gades]], [[Nicomachus]], [[Chaeremon]], and [[Lucius Annaeus Cornutus|Cornutus]].{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=18}}{{sfn|Grant|1967|page=552}} Nonetheless, Porphyry accused Origen of having betrayed true philosophy by subjugating its insights to the exegesis of the Christian scriptures.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=18}}{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=158}} Eusebius reports that Origen was summoned from Caesarea to Antioch at the behest of [[Julia Avita Mamaea]], the mother of the Roman emperor [[Severus Alexander]], "to discuss Christian philosophy and doctrine with her."&lt;ref&gt;From ''The Emergence of Christianity'', Cynthia White, Greenwood Press, 2007, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 235, approximately three years after Origen began teaching in Caesarea, Alexander Severus, who had been tolerant towards Christians, was murdered{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=19}} and the new emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]] instigated a purge of all those who had supported his predecessor.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=19}} His [[pogrom]]s targeted Christian leaders{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=19}} and, in Rome, [[Pope Pontianus]] and [[Hippolytus of Rome]] were both sent into exile.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=19}} Origen knew that he was in danger and went into hiding in the home of a faithful Christian woman named Juliana the Virgin,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=19}} who had been a student of the [[Ebionites|Ebionite]] leader [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]].{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=19}} Origen's close friend and longtime patron Ambrose was arrested in [[Nicomedia]] and Protoctetes, the leading priest in Caesarea, was also arrested.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=19}} In their honor, Origen composed his treatise ''[[Exhortation to Martyrdom]]'',{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=19}}{{sfn|Heine|2004|page=122}} which is now regarded as one of the greatest classics of Christian resistance literature.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=19}} After coming out of hiding following Maximinus's death, Origen founded a school where Gregory Thaumaturgus, later bishop of Pontus, was one of the pupils. He preached regularly on Wednesdays and Fridays, and later daily.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=17}}{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=165}}

===Later life===

Sometime between 238 and 244, Origen visited Athens, where he completed his ''Commentary on the [[Book of Ezekiel]]'' and began writing his ''Commentary on the [[Song of Songs]]''.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=20}} After visiting Athens, he visited Ambrose in Nicomedia.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=20}} According to Porphyry, Origen also travelled to Rome or Antioch, where he met [[Plotinus]], the founder of Neoplatonism.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=20–21}} The Christians of the eastern Mediterranean continued to revere Origen as the most orthodox of all theologians{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=21}} and, when the Palestinian hierarchs learned that [[Beryllus of Bostra|Beryllus]], the bishop of Bostra and one of the most energetic Christian leaders of the time, had been preaching [[adoptionism]] (i.e., belief that Jesus was born human and only became divine after his baptism),{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=21}} they sent Origen to convert him to orthodoxy.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=21}} Origen engaged Beryllus in a public disputation, which went so successfully that Beryllus promised to only teach Origen's theology from then on.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=21}} On another occasion, a Christian leader in Arabia named Heracleides began teaching that the [[Christian mortalism|soul was mortal and that it perished with the body]].{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=22}} Origen refuted these teachings, arguing that the soul is immortal and can never die.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=22}}

In {{circa}} 249, the [[Plague of Cyprian]] broke out.{{sfn|MacMullen|1992|page=}} In 250, Emperor [[Decius]], believing that the plague was caused by Christians' failure to recognise him as Divine,{{sfn|MacMullen|1992|page=}} [[Decian persecution|issued a decree for Christians to be persecuted]].{{sfn|MacMullen|1992|page=}}{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=102}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=22}} This time Origen did not escape.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=102}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=22}} Eusebius recounts how Origen suffered "bodily tortures and torments under the iron collar and in the dungeon; and how for many days with his feet stretched four spaces in the stocks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christianbookshelf.org/pamphilius/church_history/chapter_xxxix_the_persecution_under_decius.htm |title=Eusebius, '&amp;#39;Ecclesiastical History'&amp;#39;, Book 6, chapter 39 |publisher=Christianbookshelf.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy David Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', page 351, footnote 96 (Cambridge, Mass.; London: Harvard University Press, 1981) {{ISBN|0-674-16530-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=22}} The governor of Caesarea gave very specific orders that Origen was not to be killed until he had publicly renounced in faith in Christ.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=22}} Origen endured two years of imprisonment and torture,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=22}} but obstinately refused to renounce his faith.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=102}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=3, 22}} In 252, the emperor Decius was assassinated and Origen was released from prison.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=22}} Nonetheless, Origen's health was broken by the physical tortures enacted on him{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=102}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=3, 23}} and he died less than a year later at the age of sixty-nine.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=102}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=3, 23}} A later legend, recounted by [[Jerome]] and numerous itineraries, places his death and burial at [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], but little value can be attached to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jerome |title=[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus (On Illustrious Men)]] |chapter=[[s:De Viris Illustribus#Chapter 54 (Origen, surnamed Adamantius)|Chapter 54 (Origen, surnamed Adamantius)]] |authorlink=Jerome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exegetical writings===
Origen was an extremely prolific writer.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=25–26}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=245}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pages=154–155}}{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=159}} According to [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], he wrote a grand total of roughly 6,000 works over the course of his lifetime.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}}&lt;ref&gt;''Haer''., lxiv.63&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars agree that this estimate is probably somewhat exaggerated.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}} According to Jerome, Eusebius listed the titles of just under 2,000 treatises written by Origen in his lost ''Life of Pamphilus''.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}}&lt;ref&gt;''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', VI., xxxii. 3; Eng. transl., ''[[NPNF]]'', 2 ser., i. 277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Epist. ad Paulam, NPNF'', vi. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome compiled an abbreviated list of Origen's major treatises, itemizing 800 different titles.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}}

By far the most important work of Origen on textual criticism was the ''[[Hexapla]]'' ("Sixfold"), a massive comparative study of various translations of the Old Testament in six columns:{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=10, 27}} [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], Hebrew in Greek characters, the [[Septuagint]], and the Greek translations of [[Theodotion]] (a Jewish scholar from {{circa}} 180 AD), [[Aquila of Sinope]] (another Jewish scholar from {{circa}} 117-138), and [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]] (an [[Ebionites|Ebionite]] scholar from {{circa}} 193-211).{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=10, 27}}&lt;ref&gt;Trigg, Joseoph W. - ''Origen - The Early Church Fathers'' - 1998, Routledge, London and New York, page 16. Retrieved 2 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Origen was the first Christian scholar to introduce critical markers to a Biblical text.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=27}} He marked the Septuagint column of the ''Hexapla'' using signs adapted from those used by the textual critics of the [[Library of Alexandria|Great Library of Alexandria]]:{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=27}} a passage found in the Septuagint that was not found in the Hebrew text would be marked with an ''[[asterisk]]'' (*){{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=27}} and a passage that was found in other Greek translations, but not in the Septuagint, would be marked with an ''[[obelus]]'' (÷).{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=27}}

[[File:Texts of the OT.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Diagram showing the inter-relationship between various significant ancient versions and recensions of the Old Testament (some identified by their siglum). LXX here denotes the original septuagint.]]

The ''Hexapla'' was the cornerstone of the Great Library of Caesarea, which Origen founded.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=27}} It was still the centerpiece of the library's collection by the time of Jerome,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=27}} who records having used it in his letters on multiple occasions.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=27}} When the emperor [[Constantine the Great]] ordered fifty complete copies of the Bible to be transcribed and disseminated across the empire, Eusebius used the ''Hexapla'' as the master copy for the Old Testament.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=27}} Although the original ''Hexapla'' has been lost,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=27–28}} the text of it has survived in numerous fragments{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=27}} and a more-or-less complete Syraic copy of it made by the seventh-century bishop Paul of Tella has also survived.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=27–28}} For some sections of the ''Hexapla'', Origen also added additional columns containing other Greek translations;{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=27}} for the Book of Psalms, he included no less than eight Greek translations, making this section known as ''Enneapla'' ("Ninefold").{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=27}} Origen also produced the ''Tetrapla'' ("Fourfold"), a smaller, abridged version of the ''Hexapla'' containing only the four Greek translations and not the original Hebrew text.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=27}}

According to Jerome's ''Epistle'' 33, Origen wrote extensive ''[[scholia]]'' on the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], Psalms 1-15, [[Ecclesiastes]], and the Gospel of John.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}} None of these ''scholia'' have survived intact,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}} but parts of them were incorporated into the ''[[Catena (biblical commentary)|Catenaea]]'', a collection of excerpts from major works of Biblical commentary written by the Church Fathers.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}} Other fragments of the ''scholia'' are preserved in Origen's ''[[Philokalia (Origen)|Philocalia]]'' and in [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]]'s apology for Origen.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}} The ''Stromateis'' were of a similar character, and the margin of ''Codex Athous Laura'', 184, contains citations from this work on Rom. 9:23; I Cor. 6:14, 7:31, 34, 9:20-21, 10:9, besides a few other fragments. Origen composed homilies covering almost the entire Bible.

===Extant commentaries===
[[File:Origenes Opera.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|A set of manuscripts containing Latin translations of some of Origen's extant writings]]

Origen's commentaries written on specific books of scripture are much more focused on systematic exegesis than his homilies.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=29}} In these writings, Origen applies the precise critical methodology that had been developed by the scholars of the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]] in Alexandria to the Christian scriptures.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=29}} The commentaries also display Origen's impressive, encyclopedic knowledge of various subjects{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=29}} and his ability to cross-reference specific words, listing every place in which a word appears in the scriptures along with all the word's known meanings,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=29}} a feat made all the more impressive by the fact that he did this in a time when [[Bible concordance]]s had not yet been invented.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=29}} Origen's massive ''Commentary on the Gospel of John'', which spanned more than thirty-two volumes once it was completed,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=29–30}} was written with the specific intention to not only expound the correct interpretation of the scriptures, but also to refute the interpretations of the Valentinian Gnostic teacher [[Heracleon]],{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=29}}&lt;ref&gt;Joel C. Elowsky (editor), ''John 1-10. Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture: New Testament, Voliume 4a.'', page xix, (InterVarsity Press Academic, 2007). {{ISBN|978-0-8308-1489-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had used the Gospel of John to support his argument that there were really two gods, not one.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=29}} Of the original thirty-two books in the ''Commentary on John'', only nine have been preserved: Books I, II, X, XIII, XX, XXVIII, XXXII, and a fragment of XIX.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=30}}

Of the original twenty-five books in Origen's ''Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew'', only eight have survived in the original Greek (Books 10-17), covering Matthew 13.36-22.33.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=30}} An anonymous Latin translation beginning at the point corresponding to Book 12, Chapter 9 or the Greek text and covering Matthew 16.13-27.66 has also survived.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=30}}{{sfn|Heine|2004|page=124}} The translation contains parts that are not found in the original Greek and is missing parts that are found in it.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=30}} Origen's ''Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew'' was universally regarded as a classic, even after his condemnation,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=30}} and it ultimately became the work which established the Gospel of Matthew as the primary gospel.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=30}} Origen's ''Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans'' was originally fifteen books long, but only tiny fragments of it have survived in the original Greek.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=30}} An abbreviated Latin translation in ten books produced by the monk [[Tyrannius Rufinus]] at the end of the fourth century.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=31}}{{efn|When Rufinus translated the commentary in the early fifth century he noted in his preface that some of the books were lost, and doubted his ability to 'supply' what was missing and to 'restore' the work's continuity. He also noted his intention to 'abbreviate' the work. Rufinus' abbreviated Latin version in ten books is extant. The Greek fragments were found in papyri at Tura in 1941, and contain Greek excerpts from books 5-6 of the commentary. Comparison of these fragments with Rufinus' translation led to a generally positive evaluation of Rufinus' work. {{harvnb|Heine|2004|page=124}}}} The historian [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates Scholasticus]] records that Origen had included an extensive discussion of the application of the title ''[[theotokos]]'' to the Virgin Mary in his commentary,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=31}} but this discussion is not found in Rufinus's translation,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=31}} probably because Rufinus did not approve of Origen's position on the matter, whatever that might have been.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=31}}

Origen also composed a ''Commentary on the Song of Songs'',{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=31}} in which he took explicit care to explain why the Song of Songs was relevant to a Christian audience.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=31}} The ''Commentary on the Song of Songs'' was Origen's most celebrated commentary{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=31}} and Jerome famously writes in his preface to his translation of two of Origen's homilies over the Song of Songs that "In his other works, Origen habitually excels others. In this commentary, he excelled himself."{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=31}} Origen expanded on the exegesis of the Jewish [[Rabbi Akiva]],{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=31}} interpreting the Song of Songs as a mystical allegory in which the bridegroom represents the Logos and the bride represents the soul of the believer.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=31}} This was the first Christian commentary to expound such an interpretation{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=31}} and it became extremely influential on later interpretations of the Song of Songs.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=31}} Despite this, the commentary now only survives in part through a Latin translation of it made by Tyrannius Rufinus in the year 410.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=31}}{{efn|Books 1-3, and the beginning of the Book 4, survive, covering Song of Songs 1.1-2.15. Besides not including the later books of the commentary, Rufinus also omitted all of Origen's more technical discussions of the text. {{harvnb|Heine|2004|page=123}}}} Fragments of some other commentaries survive. Citations in Origen's ''[[Philokalia (Origen)|Philokalia]]'' include fragments of the third book of the commentary on Genesis.

===''Against Celsus''===
{{main|Contra Celsum}}
[[File:Grec 945 48r.jpg|thumb|Greek text of Origen's apologetic treatise ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', which is considered to be the most important work of early Christian apologetics{{sfn|Olson|1999|pages=101, 103}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=32–34}}]]

''Against Celsus'' (Greek: Κατὰ Κέλσου; Latin: ''Contra Celsum''), preserved entirely in Greek, was Origen's last treatise, written about 248. It is an apologetic work defending orthodox Christianity against the attacks of the pagan philosopher [[Celsus]], who was seen in the ancient world as early Christianity's foremost opponent.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=101}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=32}} In 178, Celsus had written a polemic entitled ''On the True Word'', in which he had made numerous arguments against Christianity.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=32}} The church had responded by ignoring Celsus's attacks,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=32}} but Origen's patron Ambrose brought the matter to his attention.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=32}} Origen initially wanted to ignore Celsus and let his attacks fade,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=32}} but one of Celsus's major claims, which held that no self-respecting philosopher of the Platonic tradition would ever be so stupid as to become a Christian, provoked him to write a rebuttal.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=32}}

In the book, Origen systematically refutes each of Celsus's arguments point-by-point{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=101}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=32–34}} and argues for a rational basis of Christian faith.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=103}}{{sfn|Heine|2004|page=127}}{{sfn|Grant|1967|page=552}} Origen draws heavily on the teachings of Plato{{sfn|Olson|1999|pages=102–103}} and argues that Christianity and Greek philosophy are not incompatible,{{sfn|Olson|1999|pages=102–103}} and that philosophy contains much that is true and admirable,{{sfn|Olson|1999|pages=102–103}} but that the Bible contains far greater wisdom than anything Greek philosophers could ever grasp.{{sfn|Olson|1999|pages=102–103}} Origen responds to Celsus's accusation that Jesus had performed his miracles using magic rather than divine powers by asserting that, unlike magicians, Jesus had not performed his miracles for show, but rather to reform his audiences.{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=103}} ''Contra Celsum'' became the most impactful of all early Christian apologetics works;{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=101}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=32–34}} before it was written, Christianity was seen by many as merely a folk religion for the illiterate and uneducated,{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=103}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=32–34}} but Origen raised it to a level of academic respectability.{{sfn|Olson|1999|pages=101, 103}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=32–34}} Eusebius admired ''Against Celsus'' so much that, in his ''Against Hierocles'' 1, he declared that ''Against Celsus'' provided an adequate rebuttal to all criticisms the church would ever face.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=33}}

===Other writings===
Between 232–235, while in Caesarea in Palestine, Origen wrote ''On Prayer'', of which the full text has been preserved in the original Greek.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=17}} After an introduction on the object, necessity, and advantage of [[prayer]], ends with an exegesis of the Lord's Prayer, concluding with remarks on the position, place, and attitude to be assumed during prayer, as well as on the classes of prayer.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=17}} ''On Martyrdom'', or the ''Exhortation to Martyrdom'', also preserved entire in Greek,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=19}} was written some time after the beginning of the persecution of [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximinus]] in the first half of 235.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=19}} In it, Origen warns against any trifling with idolatry and emphasises the duty of suffering martyrdom manfully; while in the second part he explains the meaning of martyrdom.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=19}}

The papyri discovered at Tura in 1941 contained the Greek texts of two previously unknown works of Origen.{{sfn|Heine|2004|page=127}} Neither work can be dated precisely, though both were probably written after the persecution of Maximinus in 235.{{sfn|Heine|2004|page=127}} One is ''On the Pascha''.{{sfn|Heine|2004|page=127}} The other is ''Dialogue with Heracleides'', a record written by one of Origen's stenographers of a debate between Origen and the Arabian bishop Heracleides, a [[Monarchianism|Quasi-Monarchianist]] who taught that the Father and the Son were the same.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=34–35}}{{sfn|Heine|2004|page=127}}{{sfn|Somos|2015|pages=145–146}}&lt;ref&gt;An English translation of the ''Dialogue'' is in Oulton and Chadwick, eds, ''Alexandrian Christianity'', pp. 430-455.&lt;/ref&gt; In the dialogue, Origen uses [[Socratic questioning]] to persuade Heracleides to believe in the "Logos theology",{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=34–35}}{{sfn|Somos|2015|pages=145–149}} the prototypical form of later Trinitarianism.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=35}} The debate between Origen and Heracleides, and Origen's responses in particular, have been noted for their unusually cordial and respectful nature in comparison to the much fiercer polemics of Tertullian or the fourth-century debates between Trinitarians and Arians.{{sfn|Somos|2015|pages=145–149}}

Lost works include two books on the resurrection, written before ''On First Principles'', and also two dialogues on the same theme dedicated to Ambrose. [[Eusebius]] had a collection of more than one hundred letters of Origen,&lt;ref&gt;''Historia ecclesiastica'', VI, xxxvi.3; Eng. transl. ''NPNF'', 2 ser. i.278-279.&lt;/ref&gt; and the list of Jerome speaks of several books of his epistles. Except for a few fragments, only three letters have been preserved.{{sfn|Heine|2004|page=126}} The first, partly preserved in the Latin translation of Rufinus, is addressed to friends in Alexandria.{{sfn|Heine|2004|page=126}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=15}} The second is a short letter to [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]], preserved in the ''Philocalia''.{{sfn|Heine|2004|page=126}} The third is an epistle to [[Sextus Julius Africanus]], extant in Greek, replying to a letter from Africanus (also extant), and defending the authenticity of the Greek additions to the book of Daniel.{{sfn|Heine|2004|page=126}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=20}} Forgeries of the writings of Origen made in his lifetime are discussed by Rufinus in ''De adulteratione librorum Origenis''. The ''Dialogus de recta in Deum fide'', the ''[[Philosophumena]]'' attributed to [[Hippolytus of Rome]], and the ''Commentary on Job'' by Julian the Arian have also been ascribed to him.&lt;ref name="Vicchio2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vicchio|first=Stephen J.|title=Job in the Medieval World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wotLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|date=4 October 2006|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-59752-533-6|page=23 n. 2|quote=Origen produced a full-length exposition of the book of Job, as did his student, Avagrius. Fragments of Origen’s commentary survive in ''Migne's Patrologia Graeca'', under the titles, “Selecta of Job” and “Enarrationes in Job.” Another Job commentary attributed to Origen and extant in a Latin translation in three books is not genuine. Early twentieth-century scholars conclusively have attributed the work, ''Commenttarium on Iob'', to Maximinus, a fourth century Arian writer. A third anonymous work on Job preserved in the Migne interprets the book of Job from 1:1 to 3:19. This text also mistakenly has been attributed to Origen. This writer takes the suffering of Job as a symbolic representation of the passion of Christ. He also places the blame for Job’s suffering squarely on the shoulder of Satan, who is seen in the commentary as a demonic figure. Fragments of a smaller work of Job written by Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria from 328 to 373, also survives in the PG under the title, “Exerpta in Job." Two other selections in Migne, Didymus the Blind's exegesis of Job modeled on Origen’s commentary, and a sermon by Eusebius of Emesa, also attest to the interest in Job on the part of the Christian Alexandrian school.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScheckErasmus2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scheck|first1=Thomas P.|last2=Erasmus|first2=Desiderius|title=Erasmus's Life of Origen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEONCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132|date=1 February 2016|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-2801-3|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pseudo-Origen|editor=Carl Heinrich Eduard Lommatzsch|title=Origenis Opera omnia quae graece vel latine tantum exstant et ejus nomine circumferuntur.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P70NAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR2|volume=XVI.

Origen was the first to propose the [[ransom theory of atonement]] in its fully developed form,{{sfn|Eddy|Beilby|2008|page=86}} although [[Irenaeus]] had previously proposed a [[Prototype|prototypical]] form of it.{{sfn|Eddy|Beilby|2008|page=86}} According to this theory, [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's death on the cross]] was a ransom to Satan in exchange for humanity's liberation.{{sfn|Eddy|Beilby|2008|page=86}} This theory holds that Satan was tricked by God{{sfn|Eddy|Beilby|2008|page=86}}{{sfn|Plantinga|Thompson|Lundberg|2010}} because Christ was not only free of sin, but also the incarnate Deity, whom Satan lacked the ability to enslave.{{sfn|Plantinga|Thompson|Lundberg|2010}} The theory was later expanded by theologians such as [[Gregory of Nyssa]] and [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus of Aquileia]].{{sfn|Eddy|Beilby|2008|page=86}} In the eleventh century, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] criticized the ransom theory, along with the associated [[Christus Victor]] theory,{{sfn|Eddy|Beilby|2008|page=86}} resulting in the theory's decline in western Europe.{{sfn|Eddy|Beilby|2008|page=86}} The theory has nonetheless retained some of its popularity in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Eddy|Beilby|2008|page=86}}

===Cosmology and eschatology===

Origen based his teaching of the preexistence of souls on an allegorical interpretation of the creation story in the [[Book of Genesis]].{{sfn|Scott|2012|pages=53–55}}]]

One of Origen's main teachings was the doctrine of the [[pre-existence|preexistence of souls]],{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|pages=55–56}}{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=55–56}}{{sfn|Scott|2012|pages=53–55}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|page=155}} which held that before God created the material world he created a vast number of incorporeal "[[Soul|spiritual intelligences]]" (ψυχαί).{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=55–56}}{{sfn|Scott|2012|pages=53–55}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|page=155}} All of these souls were at first devoted to the contemplation and love of their Creator,{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=55–56}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|page=155}} but, as the fervor of the divine fire cooled, almost all of these intelligences eventually grew bored of contemplating God, and their love for him "cooled off" (ψύχεσθαι).{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=55–56}}{{sfn|Scott|2012|pages=53–55}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|page=155}} When God created the world, the souls which had previously existed without bodies became incarnate.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=55–56}}{{sfn|Scott|2012|pages=53–55}} Those whose love for God diminished the most became [[demons]].{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|page=155}} Those whose love diminished moderately became human souls, eventually to be incarnated in fleshly bodies.{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|page=155}} Those whose love diminished the least became [[angels]].{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|page=155}} One soul, however, who remained perfectly devoted to God became, through love, one with the Word ([[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]) of God.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=61}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|page=155}} The Logos eventually took flesh and was born of the [[Virgin Mary]], becoming the [[God-man (Christianity)|God-man]] [[Jesus Christ]].{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=61}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|page=155}}

Origen may or may not have believed in the Platonic teaching of ''[[metempsychosis]]'' ("the transmigration of souls"; i.e. [[reincarnation]]).{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|pages=56–57}} He explicitly rejects "the false doctrine of the transmigration of souls into bodies",{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|page=55}}{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=100}} but this may refer only to a specific kind of transmigration.{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|page=55}} Geddes MacGregor has argued that Origen must have believed in ''metempsychosis'' because it makes sense within his eschatology{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|pages=54–55}} and is never explicitly denied in the Bible.{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|pages=54–55}} Roger E. Olson, however, dismisses the view that Origen believed in reincarnation as a [[New Age]] misunderstanding of Origen's teachings.{{sfn|Olson|1999|pages=99–100}} It is certain that Origen rejected the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] notion of a [[Cyclic model|cyclical universe]],{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|page=55}} which is directly contrary to his eschatology.{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|page=55}}

Origen believed that, eventually, the whole world would be converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Cahill|1994|page=53}} "since the world is continually gaining possession of more souls."{{sfn|Cahill|1994|pages=53–54}} He believed that the [[Kingdom of Heaven (Gospel of Matthew)|Kingdom of Heaven]] was not yet come,{{sfn|Cahill|1994|page=54}} but that it was the duty of every Christian to make the eschatological reality of the kingdom present in their lives.{{sfn|Cahill|1994|page=54}} Origen was a [[Universalism|Universalist]],{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|page=56}} who suggested that all people might eventually attain salvation,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=96}}{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=100}}{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|page=56}} but only after being purged of their sins through "divine fire".{{sfn|Moore|2005|page=96}} This, of course, in line of Origen's allegorical interpretation, was not ''literal'' fire, but rather the inner anguish of knowing one's own sins.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=96}}{{sfn|Moore|2005|page=96}} Origen was also careful to always maintain that universal salvation was merely a possibility and not a definitive doctrine.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=96}} Jerome quotes Origen as having allegedly written that "after aeons and the one restoration of all things, the state of [[Gabriel]] will be the same as that of the Devil, Paul's as that of [[Caiaphas]], that of virgins as that of prostitutes."{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|page=56}} Jerome, however, was not above deliberately altering quotations to make Origen seem more like a heretic{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}} and Origen himself expressly stated in his ''Letter to Friends in Alexandria'' that Satan and his demons would be not included in the final salvation.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=96}}{{sfn|Kelly|2006|page=199}}

===Ethics===
[[File:Master of Jean de Mandeville The Birth of Esau and Jacob.jpg|thumb|left|''The Birth of Esau and Jacob'' ({{circa}} 1360–1370) by Master of Jean de Mandeville. Origen used the Biblical story of Esau and Jacob to support his theory that a soul's free will actions committed before incarnation determine the conditions of the person's birth.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=58–59}}]]

Origen was an ardent believer in [[free will]]{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=56–59}} and he adamantly rejected the Valentinian idea of [[Election (Christianity)|election]].{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=58}} Instead, Origen believed that even disembodied souls have the power to make their own decisions.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=58}} Furthermore, in his interpretation of the story of [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]], Origen argued that the condition into which a person is born is actually dependent upon what their souls did in this [[Pre-existence|pre-existent]] state.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=58–59}} According to Origen, the superficial unfairness of a person's condition at birth&amp;mdash;with some humans being poor, others rich, some being sick, and others healthy&amp;mdash;is actually a by-product of what the person's soul had done in the pre-existent state.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=58–59}} Origen defends free will in his interpretations of instances of [[Prophecy|divine foreknowledge]] in the scriptures,{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=79}} arguing that Jesus's knowledge of Judas's future betrayal in the gospels and God's knowledge of Israel's future disobedience in the [[Deuteronomistic History]] only show that God knew these events would happen in advance.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=79}} Origen therefore concludes that the individuals involved in these incidents still made their decisions out of their own free will.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=79}}

Origen was an ardent [[Christian pacifism|pacifist]]{{sfn|Caspary|1979|pages=125–127}}{{sfn|Brock|1972|pages=11–12}}{{sfn|Cahill|1994|pages=53–54}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=235–236}} and, in his ''Against Celsus'', he argued that Christianity's inherent pacifism was one of the most outwardly noticeable aspects of the religion.{{sfn|Caspary|1979|pages=125–127}} While Origen did admit that some Christians served in the Roman army,{{sfn|Charles|2005|page=36}}{{sfn|Caspary|1979|pages=126–127}}{{sfn|Cahill|1994|pages=53–54}} he pointed out that most did not{{sfn|Charles|2005|page=36}}{{sfn|Cahill|1994|pages=53–54}} and insisted that engaging in earthly wars was against the way of Christ.{{sfn|Charles|2005|page=36}}{{sfn|Brock|1972|pages=11–12}}{{sfn|Cahill|1994|pages=53–54}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=235–236}} Origen accepted that it was sometimes necessary for a non-Christian state to wage wars,{{sfn|Brock|1972|page=12}} but insisted that it was impossible for a Christian to fight in such a war without compromising his or her faith, since Christ had absolutely forbidden violence of any kind.{{sfn|Brock|1972|page=12}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=235–236}} Origen explained the violence found in certain passages of the Old Testament as allegorical{{sfn|Cahill|1994|page=53}} and pointed out Old Testament passages which he interpreted as supporting nonviolence, such as {{bibleverse|Psalm|7:4-6|HE}} and {{bibleverse|Lamentations|3:27-29|HE}}.{{sfn|Cahill|1994|page=53}} Origen maintained that, if everyone were peaceful and loving like Christians, then there would be no wars and the Empire would not need a military.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=236}}

===Hermeneutics===
{{rquote|right|For who that has understanding will suppose that the first, and second, and third day, and the evening and the morning, existed without a sun, and moon, and stars? And that the first day was, as it were, also without a sky? And who is so foolish as to suppose that God, after the manner of a husbandman, planted a paradise in Eden, towards the east, and placed in it a tree of life, visible and palpable, so that one tasting of the fruit by the bodily teeth obtained life? And again, that one was a partaker of good and evil by masticating what was taken from the tree? And if God is said to walk in the paradise in the evening, and Adam to hide himself under a tree, I do not suppose that anyone doubts that these things figuratively indicate certain mysteries, the history having taken place in appearance, and not literally.|Origen, ''On the First Principles'' [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04124.htm IV.16]}}

Origen bases every part of his theology on the Christian scriptures{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=55–56}}{{sfn|Scott|2012|pages=55–58}}{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|pages=56–57}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|page=155}} and never appeals to Platonic teachings without having first supported his argument with a firm scriptural basis.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=55–56}}{{sfn|Scott|2012|pages=58–60}} He saw the scriptures as divinely inspired{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=55–56}}{{sfn|Scott|2012|pages=55–58}}{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|pages=56–57}}{{sfn|Ludlow|2013|pages=87–88}} and was also very cautious to never contradict his own interpretation of what was written in them.{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|pages=56–57}} Nonetheless, Origen did have a penchant for speculating beyond what was explicitly stated in the Bible,{{sfn|Olson|1999|pages=99–100}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=13–17}} and this habit frequently placed him in the hazy realm between strict orthodoxy and heresy.{{sfn|Olson|1999|pages=99–100}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=13–17}}

According to Origen, there are two kinds of Biblical literature, which are found in both the Old and New Testaments: ''historia'' ("history, or narrative") and ''nomothesia'' ("legislation or ethical prescription").{{sfn|Ludlow|2013|pages=87–88}} Origen expressly states that the Old and New Testaments should be read together and according to the same rules.{{sfn|Ludlow|2013|page=88}} Origen further taught that there were three different ways in which passages of scripture could be interpreted.{{sfn|Ludlow|2013|page=88}}{{sfn|Grant|1967|page=551}} The "flesh" was the literal, historical interpretation of the passage;{{sfn|Ludlow|2013|page=88}}{{sfn|Grant|1967|page=551}} the "soul" was the moral message behind the passage;{{sfn|Ludlow|2013|page=88}}{{sfn|Grant|1967|page=551}} and the "spirit" was the eternal, incorporeal reality that the passage conveyed.{{sfn|Ludlow|2013|page=88}}{{sfn|Grant|1967|page=551}} In Origen's exegesis, the [[Book of Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], and the [[Song of Songs]] represent perfect examples of the bodily, soulful, and spiritual components of scripture respectively.{{sfn|Ludlow|2013|page=90}}

Origen saw the "spiritual" interpretation as the deepest and most important meaning of the text{{sfn|Ludlow|2013|page=90}} and taught that some passages held no literal meaning at all and that their meanings were ''purely'' [[Allegory|allegorical]].{{sfn|Ludlow|2013|page=90}} Nonetheless, he stressed that "the passages which are historically true are far more numerous than those which are composed with purely spiritual meanings."{{sfn|Ludlow|2013|page=90}} Origen noticed that the accounts of Jesus's life in the four canonical gospels contain irreconcilable contradictions,{{sfn|Perkins|2007|page=292}}{{sfn|Kugel|Greer|1986|page=183}}{{sfn|Keefer|2006|pages=75–76}} but he argued that these contradictions did not undermine the spiritual meanings of the passages in question.{{sfn|Kugel|Greer|1986|page=183}}{{sfn|Keefer|2006|pages=75–76}} Origen's idea of a twofold creation was based on an allegorical interpretation of the creation story found in the first two chapters of the [[Book of Genesis]].{{sfn|Scott|2012|pages=53–55}} The first creation, described in {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:26|9}}, was the creation of the primeval spirits,{{sfn|Layton|2004|page=86}} who are made "in the image of God" and are therefore incorporeal like Him;{{sfn|Layton|2004|page=86}} the second creation described in {{bibleverse||Genesis|2:7|9}} is when the human souls are given ethereal, spiritual bodies{{sfn|Layton|2004|pages=86–87}} and the description in {{bibleverse||Genesis|3:21|9}} of God clothing Adam and Eve in "tunics of skin" refers to the transformation of these spiritual bodies into corporeal ones.{{sfn|Layton|2004|page=86}} Thus, each phase represents a degradation from the original state of incorporeal holiness.{{sfn|Layton|2004|page=86}}

===Theology===
[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg|thumb|Origen significantly contributed to the development of the concept of the [[Trinity]]{{sfn|Olson|Hall|2002|page=24}}{{sfn|La Due|2003|page=37}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pages=154–156}} and was among the first to name the Holy Spirit as a member of the Godhead,{{sfn|Olson|Hall|2002|page=25}} but he was also a [[Subordinationism|Subordinationist]],{{sfn|La Due|2003|page=38}}{{sfn|Olson|Hall|2002|page=25}}{{sfn|Pollard|1970|page=95}}{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=161}} who taught that the Father was superior to the Son and the Son was superior to the Holy Spirit.{{sfn|La Due|2003|page=38}}{{sfn|Olson|Hall|2002|page=25}}{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=161}}]]

Origen's conception of God the Father is [[Apophatic theology|apophatic]]—a perfect unity, invisible and incorporeal, transcending all things material, and therefore inconceivable and incomprehensible. He is likewise unchangeable and transcends space and time. But his power is limited by his goodness, justice, and wisdom; and, though entirely free from necessity, his goodness and omnipotence constrained him to reveal himself. This revelation, the external self-emanation of God, is expressed by Origen in various ways, the Logos being only one of many. The revelation was the first creation of God (cf. Prov. viii. 22), in order to afford creative mediation between God and the world, such mediation being necessary, because God, as changeless unity, could not be the source of a multitudinous creation.

The Logos is the rational creative principle that permeates the universe.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=80}} The Logos acts on all human beings through their capacity for logic and rational thought,{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=79–80}} guiding them to the truth of God's revelation.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=79–80}} As they progress in their rational thinking, all humans become more and more like Christ.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=80}} Nonetheless, they retain their individuality and do not become subsumed into Christ.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=80–81}} Creation came into existence only through the Logos, and God's nearest approach to the world is the command to create. While the Logos is substantially a unity, he comprehends a multiplicity of concepts, so that Origen terms him, in Platonic fashion, "essence of essences" and "idea of ideas".

Origen significantly contributed to the development of the idea of the [[Trinity]].{{sfn|Olson|Hall|2002|page=24}}{{sfn|La Due|2003|page=37}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pages=154–156}} He declared the Holy Spirit to be a part of the Godhead{{sfn|Olson|Hall|2002|page=25}} and interpreted the [[Parable of the Lost Coin]] to mean that the Holy Spirit dwells within each and every person{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=159–160}} and that the inspiration of the Holy Spirit was necessary for any kind of speech dealing with God.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=160}} Origen taught that the activity of all three parts of the Trinity were necessary for a person to attain salvation.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=161}} In one fragment preserved by Rufinus in his Latin translation of [[Pamphilus of Caesarea|Pamphilus]]'s ''Defense of Origen'', Origen seems to apply the phrase ''homooúsios'' (ὁμοούσιος; "of the same substance") to the relationship between the Father and the Son,{{sfn|La Due|2003|page=38}}{{sfn|Williams|2001|page=132}} but in other passages, Origen rejected the belief that the Son and the Father were one ''hypostasis'' as heretical.{{sfn|Williams|2001|page=132}} According to [[Rowan Williams]], because the words ''ousia'' and ''hypostasis'' were used synonymously in Origen's time,{{sfn|Williams|2001|page=132}} Origen almost certainly would have rejected ''homoousios'' as heretical.{{sfn|Williams|2001|page=132}} Williams states that it is impossible to verify whether the quote that uses the word ''homoousios'' really comes from Pamphilus at all, let alone Origen.{{sfn|Williams|2001|page=132}}

Nonetheless, Origen was a [[Subordinationism|Subordinationist]],{{sfn|La Due|2003|page=38}}{{sfn|Olson|Hall|2002|page=25}}{{sfn|Pollard|1970|page=95}}{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=161}} meaning he believed that the Father was superior to the Son and the Son was superior to the Holy Spirit,{{sfn|La Due|2003|page=38}}{{sfn|Olson|Hall|2002|page=25}}{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=161}} a model based on Platonic [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]].{{sfn|Olson|Hall|2002|page=25}} Jerome records that Origen had written that God the Father is invisible to all beings, including even the Son and the Holy Spirit,{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=152–153}} and that the Son is invisible to the Holy Spirit as well.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=152–153}} At one point Origen suggests that the Son was created by the Father and that the Holy Spirit was created by the Son,{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=153}} but, at another point, he writes that "Up to the present I have been able to find no passage in the Scriptures that the Holy Spirit is a created being."{{sfn|Olson|Hall|2002|page=25}}{{sfn|Greggs|2009|page=154}} At the time when Origen was alive, orthodox views on the Trinity had not yet been formulated{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=152–153}}{{sfn|Badcock|1997|page=43}} and Subordinationism was not yet considered heretical.{{sfn|Greggs|2009|pages=152–153}}{{sfn|Badcock|1997|page=43}} In fact, virtually all orthodox theologians prior to the [[Arian controversy]] in the latter half of the fourth century were Subordinationists to some extent.{{sfn|Badcock|1997|page=43}} Origen's Subordinationism may have developed out of his efforts to defend the unity of God against the Gnostics.{{sfn|Pollard|1970|page=95}}

==Influence on the later church==
[[File:First Council of Nicea by V.Surikov (1876-7, GTG).jpg|thumb|[[Athanasius of Alexandria]], shown standing in this 1876 oil painting by [[Vasily Surikov]], was deeply influenced by Origen's teachings.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=249–250}}{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=100}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}}]]
===Before the crises===
Origen is often seen as the first major Christian theologian.{{sfn|Moore|2014}} Though his orthodoxy had been questioned in Alexandria while he was alive,{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=13–17}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}} Origen's torture during the Decian persecution led [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria]] to rehabilitate Origen's memory there, hailing him as a martyr for the faith.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=22}} Later, after Origen's death, Dionysius became one of the foremost proponents of Origen's theology.{{sfn|Rusch|1980|pages=15–16}}{{sfn|Chadwick|1993|page=114}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=246}} Every Christian theologian who came after him was influenced by his theology, whether directly or indirectly.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}} Origen's contributions to theology were so vast and complex, however, that his followers frequently emphasized drastically different parts of his teachings to the expense of other parts.{{sfn|Rusch|1980|pages=15–16}}{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=162}} Dionysius emphasized Origen's Subordinationist views,{{sfn|Rusch|1980|pages=15–16}}{{sfn|Chadwick|1993|page=114}} which led him to deny the unity of the Trinity, causing controversy throughout North Africa.{{sfn|Rusch|1980|pages=15–16}}{{sfn|Chadwick|1993|page=114}} At the same time, Origen's other disciple [[Theognostus of Alexandria]] taught that the Father and the Son were "of one substance".{{sfn|Rusch|1980|page=15}}

For centuries after his death, Origen was regarded as the bastion of orthodoxy{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=99}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pages=155–156}} and his philosophy practically defined Eastern Christianity.{{sfn|Olson|1999|pages=99–100}} Origen himself was revered as one of the greatest of all Christian teachers;{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=25}} he was especially beloved by monks, who saw themselves as continuing in Origen's ascetic legacy.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=25}} As time progressed, however, Origen became criticized under the standard of orthodoxy in later eras, rather than the standards of his own lifetime.{{sfn|Harding|2004|pages=162–163}} In the early fourth century, the Christian writer [[Methodius of Olympus]] criticized some of Origen's more speculative arguments,{{sfn|Ramelli|2013|page=262}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}}{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=163}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=247}} but otherwise agreed with Origen on all other points of theology.{{sfn|Ramelli|2013|pages=262–263}} Peter of Antioch and [[Eustathius of Antioch]] also criticized Origen as heretical.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=163}}

Both orthodox and heterodox theologians claimed to be following in the tradition Origen had established.{{sfn|Olson|1999|pages=99–100}} [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], the most prominent supporter of the [[Holy Trinity]] at the [[First Council of Nicaea]], was deeply influenced by Origen{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=249–250}}{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=100}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}} and so were [[Basil of Caesarea]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], and [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (the so-called "[[Cappadocian Fathers]]").{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=249}}{{sfn|Olson|1999|page=100}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}} At the same time, however, many commonalities exist between Origen's theology and [[Arianism]].{{sfn|Williams|2001|pages=131–134}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=249–250}} Although the relationship between the two is still disputed,{{sfn|Williams|2001|page=131}} in antiquity, many orthodox Christians believed that Origen was the true and ultimate source of the Arian heresy.{{sfn|Williams|2001|page=131}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=249–251}}

[[File:Domenico Ghirlandaio - St Jerome in his study.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|''[[St Jerome in His Study (Ghirlandaio)|St. Jerome in His Study]]'' (1480), by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]. Although initially a student of Origen's teachings, [[Jerome]] turned against him during the First Origenist Crisis.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=252–253}} He nonetheless remained influenced by Origen's teachings for his entire life.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=253}}]]

The first Origenist crisis began in the late fourth century AD, coinciding with the beginning of monasticism in Palestine.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=163}} The first stirring of the controversy came from the [[Cyprus|Cyprian]] bishop [[Epiphanius of Salamis]], who was determined to root out all heresies and refute them.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=163}} Epiphanius attacked Origen in his anti-heretical treatises ''Ancoratus'' (375) and ''[[Panarion]]'' (376), compiling a list of teachings Origen had espoused that Epiphanius regarded as heretical.{{sfn|Harding|2004|pages=163–164}}{{sfn|Kim|2015|page=19}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=249–250}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}} Epiphanius's treatises portray Origen as an originally orthodox Christian who had been corrupted and turned into a heretic by the evils of "Greek education".{{sfn|Kim|2015|page=19}} Epiphanius particularly objected to Origen's Subordinationism, his "excessive" use of allegorical hermeneutic, and his habit of proposing ideas about the Bible "speculatively, as exercises" rather than "dogmatically".{{sfn|Harding|2004|pages=163–164}}

Epiphanius asked [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John, the bishop of Jerusalem]] to condemn Origen as a heretic. John refused on the grounds that a person could not be retroactively condemned as a heretic after the person had already died.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}} In 393, a monk named Atarbius advanced a petition to have Origen and his writings to be censured.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}} [[Tyrannius Rufinus]], a priest at the monastery on the [[Mount of Olives]] who had been ordained by John of Jerusalem and was a longtime admirer of Origen, rejected the petition outright.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=252}} Rufinus's close friend and associate [[Jerome]], who had also studied Origen, however, came to agree with the petition.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=252}} Around the same time, [[John Cassian]], a [[Semipelagianism|Semipelagian]] monk, introduced Origen's teachings to the West.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=248–249}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}}

In 394, Epiphanius wrote to John of Jerusalem, again asking for Origen to be condemned, insisting that Origen's writings denigrated human sexual reproduction and accusing him of having been an [[Encratites|Encratite]].{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}} John once again denied this request.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}} By 395, Jerome had allied himself with the anti-Origenists and begged John of Jerusalem to condemn Origen, a plea which John once again refused.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}} Epiphanius launched a campaign against John, openly preaching that John was an Origenist deviant.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}} He successfully persuaded Jerome to break communion with John and ordained Jerome's brother Paulinianus as a priest in defiance of John's authority.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}}

Meanwhile, in 397, Rufinus published a Latin translation of Origen's ''On First Principles''.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}}{{sfn|Heine|2010|page=125}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=252–253}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=36}} Rufinus was convinced that Origen's original treatise had been interpolated by heretics and that these interpolations were the source of the heterodox teachings found in it.{{sfn|Heine|2010|page=125}} He therefore heavily modified Origen's text, omitting and altering any parts which disagreed with contemporary Christian orthodoxy.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=36}}{{sfn|Heine|2010|page=125}} In the introduction to this translation, Rufinus mentioned that Jerome had studied under Origen's disciple [[Didymus the Blind]], implying that Jerome was a follower of Origen.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=252}} Jerome was so incensed by this that he resolved to produce his own Latin translation of ''On the First Principles'', in which he promised to translate every word exactly as it was written and lay bare Origen's heresies to the whole world.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=36}}{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|pages=252–253}} Jerome's translation has been lost in its entirety.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=36}}

In 399, the Origenist crisis reached Egypt.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}} [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria]] was sympathetic to the supporters of Origen{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=164}} and the church historian, [[Sozomen]], records that he had openly preached the Origenist teaching that God was incorporeal.{{sfn|Wessel|2004|page=24}} In his ''Festal Letter'' of 399, he denounced those who believed that God had a literal, human-like body, calling them illiterate "simple ones".{{sfn|Wessel|2004|page=24}}{{sfn|Harding|2004|pages=164–165}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=253}} A large mob of Alexandrian monks who regarded God as anthropomorphic rioted in the streets.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=165}} According to the church historian [[Socrates Scholasticus]], in order to prevent a riot, Theophilus made a sudden about-face and began denouncing Origen.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=165}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=253}} In the year 400, Theophilus summoned a council in Alexandria, which condemned Origen and all his followers as heretics for having taught that God was incorporeal, which they decreed contradicted the only true and orthodox position, which was that God had a literal, physical body resembling that of a human.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=165}}{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|page=57}}{{sfn|Wessel|2004|pages=24–25}}{{efn|[[Socrates Scholasticus]] describes this condemnation as a deception to gain the confidence of the Alexandrian monastic community, which vehemently upheld the teaching of an anthropomorphic Deity.{{sfn|Wessel|2004|page=24}}}}

Theophilus labelled Origen himself as the "hydra of all heresies"{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|page=57}} and persuaded [[Pope Anastasius I]] to sign the letter of the council, which primarily denounced the teachings of the [[Nitria (monastic site)|Nitrian monks]] associated with [[Evagrius Ponticus]].{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=165}} In 402, Theophilus expelled Origenist monks from Egyptian monasteries and banished the four monks known as the "[[Tall Brothers]]", who were leaders of the Nitrian community.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=165}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=253}} [[John Chrysostom]], the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], granted the Tall Brothers asylum, a fact which Theophilus used to orchestrate John's condemnation and removal from his position at the [[Synod of the Oak]] in July of 403.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=165}}{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=253}} Once John Chrysostom had been deposed, Theophilus restored normal relations with the Origenist monks in Egypt and the first Origenist crisis came to an end.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=165}}

===Second Origenist Crisis===
{{main|Origenist Crises}}
[[File:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|thumb|The Emperor [[Justinian I]], shown here in a contemporary mosaic portrait from [[Ravenna]], denounced Origen as a heretic{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=25–26}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}} and ordered all of his writings to be burned.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=25–26}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}}]]

The Second Origenist Crisis occurred in the sixth century, during the height of [[Eastern Christian monasticism#Byzantine monasticism|Byzantine monasticism]].{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=165}} Although the Second Origenist Crisis is not nearly as well documented as the first,{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=165}} it seems to have primarily concerned the teachings of Origen's later followers, rather than anything Origen himself had actually written.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=165}} Origen's disciple Evagrius Ponticus had advocated [[Christian contemplation#Contemplative prayer|contemplative, noetic prayer]],{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=165}} but other monastic communities prioritized asceticism in prayer, emphasizing fasting, labors, and vigils.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=165}} Some Origenist monks in Palestine, referred to by their enemies as "Isochristoi" (meaning "those who would assume equality with Christ"), emphasized Origen's teaching of the pre-existence of souls and held that all souls were originally equal to Christ's and would become equal again at the end of time.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=165}} Another faction of Origenists in the same region instead insisted that Christ was the "leader of many brethren", as the first-created being.{{sfn|Harding|2004|pages=165–166}} This faction was more moderate and they were referred to by their opponents as "Protoktistoi" ("First Createds").{{sfn|Harding|2004|pages=165–166}} Both factions accused the other of heresy and other Christians accused both of them of heresy.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}}

The Protoktistoi appealed to the Emperor [[Justinian I]] to condemn the Isochristoi of heresy through Pelagius, the papal ''[[apocrisarius]]''.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}} In 543 AD, Pelagius presented Justinian with documents, including a letter denouncing Origen written by Patriarch [[Ecumenical Patriarch Mennas of Constantinople|Mennas of Constantinople]],&lt;ref name="Origen and Origenism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc01.html?term=apocatastasis Apocatastasis{{snd}} §2. Opponents] in New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol_ I, Aachen{{snd}} Basilians at Christian Classics Ethereal Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Origenes der Diamantene |last=Sträuli |first=Robert | year=1987 | publisher = ABZ Verlag | location = Zurich | isbn = 3-85516-005-8 | pages = 71, 355–357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}} along with excerpts from Origen's ''On First Principles'' and several anathemata against Origen.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}} A [[Synod of Constantinople (543)|domestic synod convened to address the issue]] concluded that the Isochristoi's teachings were heretical and, seeing Origen as the ultimate culprit behind the heresy, denounced Origen himself as a heretic as well.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=25–26}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}} Emperor Justinian ordered for all of Origen's writings to be burned.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=25–26}}{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}} In the west, the ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'', which was written sometime between 519 and 553, listed Origen as an author whose writings were to be categorically banned.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}}

In 553, during the early days of the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (the Fifth Ecumenical Council), when [[Pope Vigilius]] was still refusing to take part in it, despite Justinian holding him hostage, the bishops at the council ratified an open letter which condemned Origen as the leader of the Isochristoi.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}} The letter was not part of the official acts of the council and it more or less repeated the edict issued by the Synod of Constantinople in 543.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}} It cites objectionable writings attributed to Origen, but all the writings referred to in it were actually written by Evagrius Ponticus.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}} After the council officially opened, but while Pope Vigillius was still refusing to take part, Justinian presented the bishops with the problem of a text known as ''[[Three-Chapter Controversy|The Three Chapters]]'', which attacked the Antiochene Christology.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}}

The bishops drew up a list of anathemata against the heretical teachings contained within ''The Three Chapters'' and those associated with them.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}} In the official text of the eleventh anathema, Origen is condemned as a Christological heretic,{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}}{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}} but Origen's name does not appear at all in the ''Homonoia'', the first draft of the anathemata issued by the imperial [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]],{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}} nor does it appear in the version of the conciliar proceedings that was eventually signed by Pope Vigillius, a long time afterwards.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}} These discrepancies may indicate that Origen's name may have been retrospectively inserted into the text after the Council.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}} Some authorities believe these anathemata belong to an earlier local synod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Rowan A. |last=Greer |title=Origen |publisher=Paulist Press |location=[[New York City]] |year=1979 |page=3 |isbn=0-8091-2198-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if Origen's name did appear in the original text of the anathema, the teachings attributed to Origen that are condemned in the anathema were actually the ideas of later Origenists, which had very little grounding in anything Origen himself had actually written.{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=166}}&lt;ref name="Origen and Origenism"/&gt;{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|page=57}} In fact, Popes Vigilius (537–555), [[Pope Pelagius I|Pelagius I]] (556–61), [[Pope Pelagius II|Pelagius II]] (579–90), and [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] (590–604) were only aware that the Fifth Council specifically dealt with ''The Three Chapters'' and make no mention of Origenism or Universalism, nor spoke as if they knew of its condemnation&amp;mdash;even though Gregory the Great was opposed to Universalism.&lt;ref name="Origen and Origenism"/&gt;

===After the anathemas===
{{rquote|right|If orthodoxy were a matter of intention, no theologian could be more orthodox than Origen, none more devoted to the cause of the Christian faith.|[[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], scholar of early Christianity, in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}}}}
As a direct result of the numerous condemnations of his work, only a tiny fraction of Origen's voluminous writings have survived.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|pages=25–26}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pages=155–156}} Nonetheless, these writings still amount to a massive number of Greek and Latin texts, very few of which have yet been translated into English.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=25}} Many more writings have survived in fragments through quotations from later Church Fathers.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}} It is likely that the writings containing Origen's most unusual and speculative ideas have been lost to time,{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|page=56}} making it nearly impossible to determine whether Origen actually held the heretical views which the anathemas against him ascribed to him.{{sfn|MacGregor|1982|page=56}} Nonetheless, in spite of the decrees against Origen, the church remained enamored of him{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}} and he remained a central figure of Christian theology throughout the first millennium.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}} He continued to be revered as the founder of Biblical exegesis{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}} and anyone in the first millennium who took the interpretation of the scriptures seriously would have had knowledge of Origen's teachings.{{sfn|McGuckin|2004|page=26}}

Jerome's Latin translations of Origen's homilies were widely read in western Europe throughout the Middle Ages{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}} and Origen's teachings greatly influenced those of the Byzantine monk [[Maximus the Confessor]] ({{circa}} 550–662) and the Irish theologian [[John Scotus Eriugena]] ({{circa}} 810–877).{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}} Since the [[Renaissance]], the debate over Origen's orthodoxy has continued to rage.{{sfn|Chadwick|2017}} [[Basilios Bessarion]] (1403–1472), a Greek refugee who fled to Italy after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, produced a Latin translation of Origen's ''Contra Celsum'', which was printed in 1481.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=255}} Major controversy erupted in 1487, after the [[Renaissance humanism|Italian humanist]] scholar [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–1494) issued a thesis arguing that "it is more reasonable to believe that Origen was saved than he was damned."{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=255}} A papal commission condemned Pico's position on account of the anathemas against Origen, but not until after the debate had received considerable attention.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=255}}

The most prominent advocate of Origen during the Renaissance was the Dutch humanist scholar [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (1466 – 1536), who regarded Origen as the greatest of all Christian authors{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=255}} and wrote in a letter to [[John Eck]] that he learned more about Christian philosophy from a single page of Origen than from ten pages of Augustine.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=255}} Erasmus especially admired Origen for his lack of rehetorical flourishes, which were so common in the writings of other Patristic authors.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=255}} Erasmus also borrowed heavily from Origen's defense of free will in ''On First Principles'' in his 1524 treatise ''[[De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio|On Free Will]]'', now considered his most important theological work.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=255}} In 1527, Erasmus translated and published the portion of Origen's ''Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew'' that survived only in Greek{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=256}} and, in 1536, he published the most complete edition of Origen's writings that had ever been published at that time.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=255}} While Origen's emphasis on the human effort in attaining salvation appealed to the Renaissance humanists, it made him far less appealing to the proponents of the [[Reformation]].{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=256}} [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) deplored Origen's understanding of salvation as irredeemably defective{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=256}} and declared "in all of Origen there is not one word about Christ."{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=256}} Consequently, he ordered for Origen's writings to be banned.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=256}} Nonetheless, the earlier Czech reformer [[Jan Hus]] ({{circa}} 1369–1415) had taken inspiration from Origen for his view that the church is a spiritual reality rather than an official hierarchy{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=256}} and Luther's contemporary, the Swiss reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]] (1484–1531), took inspiration from Origen for his interpretation of the eucharist as symbolic.{{sfn|Trigg|1983|page=256}}

In the seventeenth century, the English [[Cambridge Platonists|Cambridge Platonist]] [[Henry More]] (1614 – 1687) was a devoted Origenist{{sfn|Hutton|2006|page=205}} and, although he did reject the notion of universal salvation,{{sfn|Hutton|2006|page=205}} he accepted most of Origen's other teachings.{{sfn|Hutton|2006|page=205}} [[Pope Benedict XVI]] expressed admiration for Origen,{{sfn|Pope Benedict XVI|2007|pages=24–27}} describing him in a sermon as part of a series on the Church Fathers as "a figure crucial to the whole development of Christian thought", "a true 'maestro'", and "not only a brilliant theologian but also an exemplary witness of the doctrine he passed on".{{sfn|Pope Benedict XVI|2007|page=24}} He concludes the sermon by inviting his audience to "welcome into your hearts the teaching of this great master of the faith".{{sfn|Pope Benedict XVI|2007|page=27}} Modern Protestant evangelicals admire Origen for his passionate devotion to the scriptures,{{sfn|Franke|2003}} but are frequently baffled or even appalled by his allegorical interpretation of them, which many believe ignores the literal, historical truth behind them.{{sfn|Franke|2003}}

'''Peithagoras''' ({{lang-el|Πειθαγόρας}}) was a [[Macedon]]ian [[wikt:seer|seer]] and general from [[Amphipolis]], brother of [[Apollodorus of Amphipolis|Apollodorus]]. According to [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia]], Apollodorus, having joined [[Alexander the Great]] on his return from his Indian expedition and accompanied him to [[Ecbatana]], imagined that he had grounds for dreading his displeasure, and wrote therefore to Peithagoras at [[Babylon]], to inquire whether any danger threatened him from Alexander or [[Hephaestion]]. The answer was that he had nothing to fear from Hephaestion, who (so the victims portended) would soon be removed out of his way. The next day Hephaestion's death took place (324 BC) and not long after Apollodorus received the same message from Peithagoras with respect to Alexander. Peithagoras is also said to have predicted the deaths of [[Perdiccas]] and [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]].

== Biography ==
Rudolf Bereza was born in 1942 in Tovačov, in what is today the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.memoryofnations.eu/witness/index/id/2325|title=Memory of Nations  -   Rudolf Bereza (1942 - 2014) - Biography|last=perich@ora.cz|first=castulik@ora.cz,|website=www.memoryofnations.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up, he didn’t resist the Communist Regime. But in 1968, the armies of the Warsaw Pact invaded. This is the event that sparked him into dissident activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/radio_cesko/pribehy/_zprava/rudolf-bereza-autobusak-a-chartista-ktery-psal-husakovi-a-vybizel-k-obcanske-kurazi--1006998|title=Rudolf Bereza: autobusák a chartista, který psal Husákovi a vybízel k občanské kuráži|access-date=2018-07-24|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed [[Charter 77]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.totalita.cz/vysvetlivky/ch77_b.php|title=seznam signatářů Charty 77: TOTALITA: TOTALITA|last=Vlček|first=Tomáš|website=www.totalita.cz|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began to deliver [[Samizdat]] documents for the Resistance. He was close with Tomáš Hradilek with whom Bereza participated in many resistance activities. They are both well known for a letter they wrote to [[Gustáv Husák|President Husák]] titled “A Letter by Five Workers.” In this letter, they asked the President to abdicate. One of the rebellious activities Bereza is most famous for is when he and others held a banner in [[Olomouc]] that read “[[Charter 77]] calls for civic courage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bubinekrevolveru.cz/content/opo%C5%BEd%C4%9Bn%C4%9B-k-%C3%BAmrt%C3%AD-rudolfa-berezy|title=Opožděně k úmrtí Rudolfa Berezy {{!}} Bubínek Revolveru|website=www.bubinekrevolveru.cz|language=cs|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;” He also wrote another letter to [[Gustáv Husák|President Husák]] asking him to let political prisoners free and this letter was broadcast on [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]]. During his time of dissidence, he was arrested and brought in for questioning many times. The StB even wiretapped his house. After the Velvet Revolution, Bereza was involved in the countries move from communism to democracy. He was involved in the Czech National Council for the Civic Forum and worked as a police chief and bus driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seniorum.cz/nase-vzpominky/hlasy-hrdinu/4640-rudolf-bereza-281942-29|title=Naše vzpomínky {{!}} Seniorum.cz|website=www.seniorum.cz|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though he is not that well known, a few Czech organizations have interviewed him to document his story, like [[Post Bellum]].

'''Zbigniew Oleśnicki''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈzbʲiɡɲɛf ɔlɛˈɕɲit͡skʲi|lang}}; 5 December 1389 in [[Sienno, Masovian Voivodeship]] &amp;ndash; 1 April 1455), known in [[Latin]] as '''Sbigneus''', was a high-ranking [[Roman Catholic]] clergyman and an influential [[Poland|Polish]] statesman and diplomat. He served as [[Bishop of Kraków]] from 1423 until his death in 1455. He took part in the management of the country's most important affairs, initially as a royal secretary under King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] and later as the effective [[regent]] during King [[Władysław III of Poland|Władysław III]]'s minority. In 1449 he became the first native Polish [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]].

==Biography== 
At the age of twenty he was secretary to King [[Władysław Jagiełło]], and fought with him in the [[battle of Grunwald]] on 15 July 1410.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{CathEncy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11240c.htm|title=Zbigniew Olesnicki}}&lt;/ref&gt; A favourite with the king, he took part in the management of the country's most important affairs.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; His influence with the king greatly aided him in opposing the [[Hussites]], who had gained royal favour.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; On 9 July 1423, he was appointed to the [[episcopal See]] of [[Kraków]], and in 1433 he was sent by the king as legate to the [[council of Basle]], where he endeavoured to be on friendly terms with both parties.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

In the 1430s he opposed [[Spytek of Melsztyn]] in a conflict which led to a short lived civil war and Spytek's death in 1439.&lt;ref name="Penson"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Oskar Halecki |author2=W: F. Reddaway |author3=J. H. Penson |title=The Cambridge History of Poland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N883AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA237|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-1-00-128802-4|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaques2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Jaques|title=Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: F-O|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dh6jydKXikoC&amp;pg=PA412|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33538-9|page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 1439, he was created [[cardinal priest]] with the titular church of [[St. Prisca]], by [[Pope Eugene IV]].&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; (The antipope [[Felix V]] also made him a cardinal on 20 January 1440.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Eubel, ''Hierarchia catholica medii aevi'', Münster: sumptibus et typis librariae regensbergianae, 1901), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;). As cardinal, his influence in Poland was second only to that of the king, and, during the frequent absence of [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV]] in [[Lithuania]], he transacted the affairs of the State.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;
[[file:Zbigniew Olesnicki.jpg|left|150px]]
He was recognized as one of the two most important Polish magnates of his time (the other one was magnate {{ill|Jan Tęczyński (died 1470)|lt=Jan Tęczyński|pl|Jan z Tęczyna}}).&lt;ref name=pwn&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3986965 Tęczyńscy], [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN|PWN Encyklopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1449, after the death of [[archbishop of Gniezno]] and [[primate of Poland]] [[Wincenty Kot]], the position was proposed to Oleśnicki, but he refused it. It then passed to his political rival, bishop [[Władysław Oporowski]].&lt;ref name=diec&gt;{{pl icon}} Bernadeta Kruszyk, [http://www.archidiecezja.pl/pl/historia/arcybiskupi/poczet_arcybiskupow_gnieznienskich/wladyslaw_oporowski.html Władysław Oporowski], Poczet Arcybiskupów Gnieźnieńskich, Archidiecezja Gnieźnieńska&lt;/ref&gt;

In his conduct of Poland's affairs Oleśnicki entertained far-reaching imperial dreams, which included a complete assimilation of [[Lithuania]] into the Polish state and the conquest of [[Silesia]] from the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. In particular, Oleśnicki pursued the idea of a Crusading alliance with [[Hungary]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks, with the ultimate aim of extending Poland's boundaries to the [[Black Sea]]. This was manifested in promoting [[Władysław III of Poland|Władysław III]]'s taking the [[King of Hungary|Hungarian Crown]] - to which some Polish magnates were strongly opposed. However, all these aspirations came to naught with King Władysław's death at the [[Battle of Varna]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Being a man of great learning, he advanced the study of arts and letters in every possible way, and the flourishing condition of the [[University of Krakow]] during his episcopacy is due chiefly to his efforts.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; The well-known chronicler [[Jan Długosz]] was his secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05069b.htm|title=Jan Dlugosz|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To repress the spread of Hussitism he called [[Giovanni da Capistrano]] (then in [[Breslau]]) and the [[Minorites]] to Kraków.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

Da Capistrano, whom Oleśnicki invited, was also known for his anti-Jewish zeal, in which he engaged in Poland as in other countries. Oleśnicki's own Anti-[[Jew]]ish intolerance was manifested in his strongly criticising [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV]] for reaffirming in 1453 the tolerant measures towards Jews enacted by [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III]]. Under Oleśnicki's influence, the 1454 [[Statutes of Nieszawa]] included the provisions that Jews' rights be "restricted when they contradict [[canon law]]" and that Polish Jews be compelled to wear distinctive clothing. However, this was never enforced in practice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

'''Zhang Chengzhi''' ([[Xiao'erjing]]: {{lang|zh-Arab|ﺟْﺎ  ﭼْﻊ جِ }}, born 10 September 1948) is a contemporary [[Hui people|Hui]] Chinese author. Often named as the most influential [[Muslim]] writer in China, his historical narrative ''[[History of the Soul]]'', about the rise of the [[Jahriyya]] (哲合忍耶) [[menhuan|Sufi order]], was the second-most popular book in China in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Gladney 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Zhang was born in [[Beijing]] in 1948 to Hui parents of [[Shandong]] origin.&lt;ref name="Deng 1989"&gt;Deng 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his Muslim ancestry, he was raised as an atheist.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He graduated from [[High School attached to Tsinghua University|Tsinghua University Middle School]] in 1967, at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. According to the ''[[People's Daily]]'', Zhang was the first person to call himself a "[[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]]"; he used it as his pen name during his student days. Then on May 29, 1966, just two weeks after the ''People's Daily'' announced the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Zhang convinced around ten other senior-level students to use the collective name "Mao Zedong's Red Guards" in addition to their individual signatures when signing a [[big-character poster|large-character poster]] denouncing their school officials; three days later, they issued another large-character poster under the same collective name, entitled "We Must Resolutely Carry Out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to its End", with over one hundred signatures. Soon, students from all over Beijing began to call themselves "Red Guards".&lt;ref&gt;People's Daily 2001-04-13. Original title: "坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fisac 2003: 163&lt;/ref&gt;

After his graduation, Zhang was "[[Down to the Countryside Movement|sent down]]" to Ujimqin Banner in [[Xilin Gol League]], [[Inner Mongolia]], where he lived for four years before returning to Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;G. Yuan 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ujimqin Banner is administratively divided into [[East Ujimqin Banner]] and [[West Ujimqin Banner]]; sources do not specify exactly where Zhang worked&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after his return, he entered the archaeology department of [[Peking University]], graduating in 1975. He began his writing career in 1978,  with the publication of a poem in [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] entitled "Son of the People" (做人民之子/''Arad-un-huu'') and a Chinese-language short story "Why does the rider sing?" (骑手为什么歌唱).&lt;ref name="Xinhua 2006-05-17"&gt;Xinhua 2006-05-17&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he entered a master's program in history at the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]]'s Department of [[Languages of China|Minority Languages]], from which he graduated in 1981. In 1983, he received funding to go to Japan as an international exchange scholar, where he conducted research at Tokyo's [[Tōyō Bunko]], the largest [[Asian studies]] library in Japan.&lt;ref name="Deng 1989"/&gt; Aside from Chinese and Mongolian, Zhang also speaks [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and once audited a class in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] at the [[Central University for Nationalities]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Black Steed'', English edition back matter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua 2004-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang noted that during the [[Chinese Muslims in the Second Sino-Japanese War|Second Sino-Japanese War, Hui Muslims were suspicious of the intentions of Japanese researchers]] and deliberately concealed important religious information from them when interviewed.&lt;ref name="Robertson2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Robertson|title=A Companion to the Anthropology of Japan|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U51zs-HHchQC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=makino+muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=makino%20muslim&amp;f=false|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-4145-1|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
Zhang is often identified as a representative of the so-called [[xungen movement|''xungen'' movement]] ("searching for roots"), despite the fact that he himself dismisses entire concept of ''xungen''.&lt;ref&gt;Wang 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shi 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; His work repeatedly touches on the themes of martyrdom, everlasting tradition, and resistance to materialism and urban life.&lt;ref name = "Wu2000 128-9"&gt;Wu 2000: 128–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike many other authors who lived through the Cultural Revolution and regret the chaos it created in their lives, even Zhang's early works such as ''Rivers of the North'' and ''Black Steed'' exhibit a noticeable level of idealism about his time as a Red Guard, and clearly demonstrate his desire to rebut the presumptions of [[scar literature]].&lt;ref&gt;McDougall and Louie 1997: 395–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Yuan 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Analyses of Zhang's impact on Chinese literature and thought vary greatly. [[Zhu Xueqin]] expressed his admiration of Zhang for "casting off his old self" and taking a "firm stand" for idealistic values and against ethnocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu 2003: 96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dru Gladney]], in contrast, analysed Zhang's popularity in terms of a larger trend of consumerist exoticisation of "ethnic chic" in 1990s China.&lt;ref name="Gladney 2000"&gt;Gladney 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, both in China and abroad, go further in rendering harsh judgments: they denounce Zhang as "xenophobic" and criticise his continued support of [[Maoism]] even after his conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Fisac 2003: 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 1980s have been described as Zhang's "lyrical phase".&lt;ref&gt;Li 2000: 115.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his works during this period, he has been described as one of China's first practitioners of "[[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]]" fiction.&lt;ref name = "Wu2000 128-9" /&gt; In 1984, however, Zhang quit his job at the China Writers' Association and moved to China's Northwest, spending six years living with the Muslims of Xihaigu, [[Ningxia]]. His time there resulted not only in his conversion to Islam and, in one critic's words, his "open renunciation of [[Chinese culture]]", but also in what is easily his most famous book: ''History of the Soul'', a work of narrative historical fiction which explores personal and religious conflicts during 172 years of development of the Jahriyya [[tariqah]] in China's northwest, interwoven with his own observations.&lt;ref name="Gladney 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lin 2005: 133–36.&lt;/ref&gt;
