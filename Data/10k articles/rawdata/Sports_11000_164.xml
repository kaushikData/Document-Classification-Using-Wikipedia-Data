The '''[[1976–77 NHL season|1976–77]] [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]] season''' was the first [[Season (sports)|season]] for this franchise in [[Cleveland]], after nine seasons in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] as the [[California Golden Seals|Oakland Seals/California Golden Seals]]. The Barons displaced the [[World Hockey Association]]'s [[Cleveland Crusaders]], who elected to relocate to Minnesota and become the [[Minnesota Fighting Saints]].

The Barons played in the tough [[Adams Division]] and spent most of the season in last place. Midway through the season, majority owner [[Melvin Swig]] announced the team might have trouble finishing the season. The club missed payroll twice in February, and only a loan from the league and [[National Hockey League Players' Association|NHLPA]] kept the team afloat. Following the season, minority owner George Gund III purchased a controlling interest in the club.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/cleveland/barons.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bass fishing''' is the activity of [[angling]] for the [[North America]]n [[fish|gamefish]] known colloquially as the ''[[Micropterus|black bass]]''.&lt;ref name="HEN"&gt;Henshall, James A. (Dr.), ''Book of the Black Bass'', Cincinnati, OH: Robert Clarke &amp; Co. (1881)&lt;/ref&gt;  There are numerous black bass species considered as gamefish in North America, including [[largemouth bass]] (''Micropterus salmoides''), [[smallmouth bass]] (''Micropterus dolomieui''), [[spotted bass]] or Kentucky bass (''Micropterus punctulatus''), and [[Guadalupe bass]] (order ''[[Perciformes]]'').&lt;ref&gt;- Retrieved 7/2013 [http://www.fishingtipsdepot.com/bass-fishing-tips.php] About Bass, Bass Fishing and Bass Fishing Tips&lt;/ref&gt; Black bass are members of the sunfish ([[Centrarchidae]]) family. 

Modern bass [[fishing]] has evolved into a multibillion-dollar industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asafishing.org/asa/newsroom/newspr_092607.html ''Angling Retains its Mainstream Appeal and Broad Economic Impact''-American Sportfishing Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513203715/http://www.asafishing.org/asa/newsroom/newspr_092607.html |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sport has changed drastically since its beginnings in the late 19th century.  From humble beginnings, the black bass has become the most specifically sought-after game fish in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.saltstrong.com/articles/most-popular-game-fish-in-america/&lt;/ref&gt; The sport has driven the development of all manner of [[fishing tackle|fishing gear]], including rods, reels, lines, lures, electronic depth and fish-finding instruments, drift boats, float tubes, kayaks, and also boats specified for bass fishing.

All black bass are well known as strong fighters and are fished recreationally.  Depending upon species and various other factors such as water quality and availability of food, black bass may be found in lakes, reservoirs, ponds, rivers, streams, creeks, even roadside ditches.&lt;ref name="HEN"/&gt;  Largemouth are known for their greater overall size and resistance when hooked, favoring short, powerful runs and escape to cover such as submerged logs or weedbeds,&lt;ref name="WAT"&gt;Waterman, Charles F., ''Black Bass &amp; the Fly Rod'', Stackpole Books (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; while smallmouth bass tend to jump more and fight aggressively on the surface when hooked, in order to throw the hook.&lt;ref name="WAT"/&gt; The All-Tackle world record Largemouth was caught on June 2nd, 1932, on Montgomery Lake, GA by George Perry, weighing in at 22 lbs. 4 oz. George Perry’s record fish, which some consider the “Holy Grail” of all freshwater sport fishing records, was finally challenged by Japanese angler Manabu Kurita on July 22nd, 2009. Kurita’s catch was officially certified by the [[Igfa|IGFA]], weighing 22 lbs. 4 oz, the same weight as Perry’s legendary catch. Both Perry and Kurita share the All-Take world record. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gameandfishmag.com/fishing/bass/largemouth-bass/10-biggest-largemouth-bass-world-records-ever/|title=10 Biggest Largemouth Bass World Records Ever - Game &amp; Fish|date=2015-05-12|work=Game &amp; Fish|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All black bass are scent as well as visual predators so care should be taken to ensure no foreign scents, like bug spray, or any outdoor chemicals, or any personal chemicals, like tobacco, contaminate one's hands when handling your line, reels, rods, artificial baits, and particularly soft plastics.&lt;ref name="CIR"&gt;Circle, Homer, ''Bass Wisdom'', Guilford, CT: Lyons Press/Globe Pequot, {{ISBN|1-58574-036-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58574-036-9}} (2000), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Bass are usually filleted when taken for the table; the flesh is white and flaky, with a mild taste when cooked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gf.state.az.us/h_f/fish_largemouth_bass.shtml  Arizona Game &amp; Fish Department, ''Bass Fishing in Arizona''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503203714/http://www.gf.state.az.us/h_f/fish_largemouth_bass.shtml |date=May 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both avid and professional bass fisherman often prefer to practice catch and [[Catch and Release|release]] as a method of conservation.

==Background==
Bass fishing in the United States largely evolved on its own, and was not influenced by angling developments in Europe or other parts of the world. Indeed, modern British sea bass fishermen look to the United States freshwater bass techniques for inspiration for lure fishing and to the USA, Japan and China for tackle. During the early-to-mid-19th century, wealthy sport anglers in the United States (mostly located in the northeastern portion of the country) largely confined themselves to trout and salmon fishing using [[fly fishing|fly rods]].  While [[smallmouth bass]] were sought by some fly fishermen,&lt;ref name="HEN"/&gt; most bass fishing was done by sustenance anglers using [[fishing rod|poles]] and live bait.&lt;ref name="WAT"/&gt;  The working-class heritage of bass fishing strongly influenced the sport and is manifested even today in its terminology, hobbyist literature, and media coverage.&lt;ref name="WAT"/&gt;

In the mid-19th century, the first artificial lure used for bass was developed in the form of an [[artificial fly]].&lt;ref name="HEN"/&gt;  At first, these artificial fly patterns were largely derivations of existing trout and salmon [[Artificial fly|flies]].&lt;ref name="HEN"/&gt;  As time went on, new fly patterns were specifically developed to fish for bass, as well as heavier spinner/fly lures that could be cast by the baitcasting and fixed-spool casting [[fishing reel|reels]] and [[fishing rod|rods]] available at the time.&lt;ref name="WAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan, Will 1996"&gt;Ryan, Will, ''Smallmouth Strategies for the Fly Rod'', Lyons &amp; Burford Publishers (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Floating wooden lures (plugs) or poppers of lightweight cork or balsa were introduced around 1900, sometimes combined with hooks dressed with artificial fur or feathers.&lt;ref name="WAT"/&gt;  Production of the plastic worm began in 1949, but it was not until the 1960s that its use became popular. The plastic worm revolutionized the sport of bass fishing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://probassfishingsecrets.com ''Pro Bass Secrets: Fishing Tips for Bass'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620203225/http://probassfishingsecrets.com/ |date=June 20, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the sport of bass fishing was greatly advanced by the stocking of largemouth and smallmouth bass outside their native ranges in the latter portion of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="HEN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan, Will 1996" /&gt;  As the nation's [[railroad]] system expanded, large numbers of 'tank' ponds were built by damming various small creeks that intersected the tracks in order to provide water for [[steam engine]]s; later, new towns often sprang up alongside these [[water stop]]s.&lt;ref name="WAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan, Will 1996" /&gt;  Shippers found that black bass were a hardy species that could be transported in buckets or barrels via the railroad, sometimes using the spigot from the railroad water tank to aerate the fingerlings.&lt;ref name="Ryan, Will 1996" /&gt;
[[Image:Angler largemouth.jpg|thumb|left|''M. salmoides'' (largemouth bass) caught by an angler in Connecticut]]

Largemouth bass were often stocked in tank ponds and warmer lakes, while smallmouth bass were distributed to lakes and rivers throughout the northern and western United States, as far west as California.&lt;ref name="WAT"/&gt;  Smallmouth were transplanted east of the Appalachians just before the Civil War, and afterwards introduced into New England.&lt;ref name="WAT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Will, ''Smallmouth Strategies for the Fly Rod, Lyons &amp; Burford Publishers'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Largemouth bass populations boomed after the U.S. Department of Agriculture began to advise and assist farmers in constructing and stocking farm ponds with largemouth bass, even offering advice on managing various fish species.  Soon, those who had stocked largemouth bass on their farm ponds began to pursue them on a burgeoning number of new reservoirs and impoundments built in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s.  These impoundments coincided with a postwar fishing boom, additional funds from sales of fishing licenses for the first large-scale attempts at bass fisheries management.  This was especially true in the southern United States, where the largemouth bass thrived in waters too warm or turbid for other types of gamefish.&lt;ref name="WAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan, Will 1996" /&gt;

With increased industrialization and development, many of the nation's eastern trout rivers were dammed, polluted, or allowed to silt up, raising water temperatures and killing off the native [[brook trout]].  Smallmouth bass were often introduced to northern rivers now too warm for native trout, and slowly became a popular gamefish with many anglers.&lt;ref name="WAT"/&gt;  Equally adaptable to large, cool-water impoundments and reservoirs, the smallmouth also spread far beyond its original native range.  Later, smallmouth populations also began to decline after years of damage caused by overdevelopment and industrial and agricultural pollution, as well as a loss of river habitat caused by damming many formerly wild rivers in order to form lakes or reservoirs.  In recent years, a renewed emphasis on preserving water quality and riparian habitat in the nation's rivers and lakes, together with stricter management practices, eventually benefited smallmouth populations and has caused a resurgence in their popularity with anglers.&lt;ref name="WAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan, Will 1996" /&gt;

==Rise of modern bass fishing==
[[Image:Largemothbassbaby.JPG|right|thumb|Example of a very young specimen of ''M. salmoides'' (largemouth bass) caught by an angler in [[Minnesota]]]]
By the early 20th century, bass fishing had been well established as a sport with its own following.  Though the use of artificial lures for bass had begun with the [[artificial fly]] and [[fly fishing]] tackle, the bait casting rod and reel soon came to dominate the sport.  Although fixed-spool reels were introduced in use in the United States as early as the 1870s,&lt;ref name="HEN"/&gt; [[fishing reel|spinning]] reels and [[fishing rod|rods]] did not gain wide acceptance as an angling tool until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;playboy.com [http://www.orcaonline.org/reel_history.htm O.R.C.A. Online, Reel History]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, most bass anglers have used bait casting or spinning tackle, using either artificial lures or live bait (See [[Fishing rod]], [[Fishing reel]]).&lt;ref name="WAT"/&gt;

During the 1950s and 1960s, the development of specific angling tools for bass significantly increased angler bass catches and helped stimulate the development of the sport.  Some of these innovations include the invention of monofilament nylon fishing lines, the [[fiberglass]] (later [[graphite]] composite) fishing rod, the electric trolling motor, the fish finder/depth locator, and new artificial lures and baits made of various plastics. Recently, advanced electronics that mimic the sounds of schooling [[bait fish]] have been introduced, and a controversy has arisen over the proper use of these devices in bass tournament fishing.

Since the early 1990s, [[fly fishing]] for bass, particularly smallmouth bass, has again become popular, using fly patterns, [[fishing rod|rods]], and [[fly fishing|fly lines]] suited for bass.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Harry, ''[http://www.globepequot.com/globepequot/index.cfm?fuseaction=customer.product&amp;product_code=1%2D55821%2D534%2D4&amp;category_code= |Fly Fishing for Smallmouth Bass]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', Lyons Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreh, Lefty, ''[http://www.globepequot.com/globepequot/index.cfm?fuseaction=customer.product&amp;product_code=1%2D59228%2D310%2D1&amp;category_code= |Fly Fishing for Bass]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', Lyons Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The Largemouth Bass is the most common sport fish in America. Many people are unaware that fly fishing is a growing source of bass catching, specifically in places where trophy bass are available such as [[Southern California]] and [[San Diego]].  Here prime Florida largemouth are some of the largest in the world and some of the toughest to catch.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web|url=http://sdfish.com/top-25-biggest-largemouth-bass-ever-caught |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208153153/http://sdfish.com/top-25-biggest-largemouth-bass-ever-caught |archivedate=2014-12-08 |df= }}"&lt;/ref&gt; Several well known bass fishermen have been attracting attention to the fishery.  Local fly shops offer services to pursue the fish which can be challenging.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Matthew, "[http://www.theflystop.com/san-diego-fly-fishing-guide-shop-charter/california-bass-carp-large-mouth-small] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217134111/http://www.theflystop.com/san-diego-fly-fishing-guide-shop-charter/california-bass-carp-large-mouth-small |date=2014-12-17 }}"theflystop.com, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There are several very well known bass lakes here including; Lake Dixon, Lake Jennings, [[Miramar Reservoir]], and [[Lake Murray (California)]].

Fishermen, conservation groups, and governmental wildlife departments have introduced black bass of various species across the world for the sport of fishing.  Outside North America, [[Japan]] and [[South Africa]] have active programs.
Bass fishing as a sport was helped along by the chase for the standing world record which has held for over 75 years. Though surrounded by controversy it is widely accepted that in 1932 a 22 pound 4 ounce bass was caught by George Perry in Montgomery Lake, Georgia. It is one of the longest standing records in the sport of fishing. This record was tied on July 2, 2009 when Aichi Japan resident Manabu Kurita caught a 22 pound 4 ounce largemouth bass in [[Lake Biwa]].&lt;ref&gt;International Game and Fish Association [http://wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc=AllTackle&amp;cn=Bass,%20largemouth Largemouth Bass All-Tackle World Record]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population management==
[[Image:Bassboat1.jpg|thumb|Typical aluminium bass boat with gas motor and electric trolling motor]]
[[Image:Bassboat2.jpg|thumb|Center console aluminum bass boat]]
The increasing popularity of the sport combined with "catch and release" practices have in some cases led to an overpopulation of bass.

An overpopulated, stunted bass population can best be detected in the spring when all the bass are at least one year old. If virtually all the bass are 4&amp;nbsp;inches long or smaller, the population is probably stunted. Some indicators that a bass population is overpopulated:

# The largemouth bass caught are all less than 1 pound and are "skinny".
# The bluegills are 1/2 pound and larger (too large for the bass to eat).

An overpopulation and/or stunting of bass may be caused by several factors including:

# Not enough bass being harvested.
# Too few bluegill or redear sunfish were stocked initially or they are failing to reproduce and the bass population does not have an adequate food supply.

It is posited that the easiest way to control an overpopulation of largemouth bass is by increasing the take of bass. This is clearly an effective method of thinning the bass population providing recreation at the same time. It may take two to three years to bring the population back into balance. If [[forage fish]] are scarce, stock adult bluegill or redear sunfish (7 to 8&amp;nbsp;inches long). These fish will be too large to be eaten by the bass. The large panfish will spawn in the spring and produce a supply
of forage. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070721000059/http://www.dfg.ca.gov/fishing/assets/documents/InfoLeaflets/No_23.pdf]

==Other species==
Black bass should not be confused with a multitude of unrelated fish species found around the world and called "bass", such as the butterfly [[peacock bass]] (''Cichla ocellaris''), speckled peacock bass (''Cichla temensis''), Papuan black bass (''Lutjanus goldiei'') (also called  Niugini bass), [[Australian bass]], [[rock bass]]  (''Ambloplites rupestris''), American striped bass, and British sea bass (''Dicentrarchus labrax'').

==Competition==
{{see also|Fishing tournament}}
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}

In modern bass fishing competitions, caught bass are placed in a live well, and released as soon as caught and weighed by officials. Competitors are penalized heavily for dead fish and in some cases dead fish are not weighed. Fish turned in for weighing are immediately released or placed in tanks and treated for stress and glyco-protein (slime coat) injury, then released back into the water.

=== United States ===
There are several major bass fishing competitions in the United States, with the two most dominant circuits being Bassmasters and the FLW series.

* The ''Bassmaster Tournament Trail'' is organized by the [[Bass Anglers Sportsman Society]] (BASS). It was started by [[Ray Scott (angler)|Ray Scott]], the "father" of competitive bass fishing.  First held in 1969, today, professionals like [[Michael Iaconelli]], [[Kevin VanDam]], Aaron Martens, [[Rick Clunn]], [[Cliff Pace]], and [[Luke Clausen]] are household names to many American sports fans.  There are 12 events in which the top 50 anglers compete.  The top prize in the [[Bassmaster Classic]] is $500,000. 
* The ''Walmart FLW Tour'' was named after [[Forrest L. Wood]] of [[Ranger Boats]] fame. The top prize of the Forrest Wood Cup is $1 million. Both tours are nationally televised on networks like [[ESPN]] and [[Fox Sports Net]], and covered extensively by [[news media]].
* American Bass Anglers (ABA), formerly the Military Bass Anglers Association,  award National championship tournament winners with a Triton Bass boat and Championship ring amongst other prizes.  Thomas Wayne Jones, Sr., from Springfield Tennessee won the 2007 ABA National championship.
* On the West Coast, WON BASS has been the main regional circuit in operation since the 1980s. Annually, WON BASS conducts the ''U.S. Open of Bass Fishing'' at [[Lake Mead, Nevada]], which pays back nearly $500,000 per event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wonbass.com/|website=WON BASS|title=WON BASS Tournaments|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a test of both angling skill and endurance as the anglers compete for 3 days in the scorching hot sun and windy conditions of the [[Mojave Desert]]. Renowned anglers Ricky Clunn, Byron Velvick, Aaron Martens, and Gary Klein have all been crowned champions during the Open's 25-year history.

==== High school ====

The state of Illinois was the first to make competitive bass fishing a state-sanctioned high school sport in 2009. They offer 22 sectional tournaments which cater to 250 high school teams across the state. Teams which qualify at the sectional level compete for the state title in May.

States across the country have taken to Illinois' lead. Kentucky was the second to follow suit in 2012. Private groups have seen the opportunity to grow the industry as well through exposure of high school student to tournament bass fishing. The Bass Federation, for example, offers high school tournament series in over 40 states, eventually crowning a State Champion and giving them the opportunity to compete on the national level.

==== Collegiate ====
{{See also|Intercollegiate sports team champions#Fishing}}

Competitive collegiate bass fishing circuits in the United States include FLW College Fishing, the Bassmaster College Series, and Cabela's Collegiate Bass Fishing Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schonbrun|first1=Zach|title=Collegiate Fishing's Added Lure: Cash on the Line|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/sports/a-paycheck-for-college-athletes-join-the-fishing-team.html|accessdate=October 19, 2014|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 18, 2014|pages=A1 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FLW College Series includes three regional qualifiers in each of the five regions of the United States denoted by FLW. The top fifteen finishing teams in each of these regional qualifiers advance to the Regional Invitational tournament and have an opportunity to advance to the FLW College National Championship and fish for a place in the following year's Forrest L Woods Cup Professional Bass Tournament.

Similarly, the Bassmaster College Series divides the nation into 5 regions. They only offer one qualifying opportunity at the regional level as opposed to the three offered by the FLW College Series. The top 15 from each of the 5 regional qualifiers advance directly to the Bassmaster College Series National Champion and compete for a position in the following year's Bassmaster Classic.

The Cabelas Collegiate Bass Fishing Series is compiled of numerous tournaments accredited by the Association of Collegiate Anglers. The tournaments range in size from 20-30 boats all the way up to 100+ boats. The Cabelas Collegiate Bass Fishing Series compiles a ranking of "School of the Year" points, which are often coveted by schools across the country. These points are gathered through successful tournament finishes in tournaments recognized by the Association of Collegiate Anglers. Cabelas Collegiate Bass Fishing Series also hosts a large-scale national open. This is not the only one of its kind, as BoatUS also hosts a similar "National Championship." Unlike the Bassmaster College Series and FLW College Series National Championships, these require no qualification from regional tournaments, and can be entered simply by signing up and paying the entry fee.

The Indiana University was the first to establish a tournament fishing club in 1989, with Purdue University creating one soon afterwards. The University of Illinois was third to make a tournament bass fishing student organization, and the trend has grown tremendously ever since.

=== Other countries ===

Competitive bass fishing has also spread to anglers in other countries such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Italy]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]]. Takahiro Omori, a Japanese angler living in Texas, won the 2004 Bassmaster Classic title. Australian tournaments are based on a native freshwater fish called [[Australian bass]] that is unrelated to largemouth bass.

== Professional bass angling ==
With the rise in popularity of competitive bass fishing came the multibillion-dollar industry of professional bass angling.  The rise in popularity and the companies that have supported the sport have now made it possible to turn bass angling into a professional sport.  A professional bass angler is a person who competes in bass fishing pro circuit and may also have company sponsorships.  Some famous pro circuits include [[Bass Anglers Sportsman Society]] (BASS), [[FLW Outdoors|Walmart FLW Tour]], and the Professional Anglers Association Tour (PAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameandfishmag.com/fishing/how-to-become-pro-bass-angler/|title=How to Become a Pro Bass Angler|last=Samsel|first=Jeff|date=Feb 28, 2012|website=Game and Fish Mag|publisher=n.p.|access-date=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional bass anglers are not able to simply sign up for these professional circuits.  The angler must compete and win local and smaller events to in order create a reputation.  Many professional bass anglers also get company sponsorships.  These sponsorships help fund the expenses of being a bass angler.  In turn the angler is also promoting the company that they are sponsored by.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldfishingnetwork.com/bassmaster-classic/post/how-to-become-a-pro-and-fish-in-the-bassmaster-classic|title=Fishing Central How To Become A Pro And Fish In The Bassmaster Classic - World Fishing Network|last=Network|first=World Fishing|date=2012-02-21|website=World Fishing Network|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a professional bass angler is a full-time job.  When the angler is not competing it is essential to attend public seminars and give presentations.  It is the anglers job to market himself in order for the sponsors to become a more well known company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bassresource.com/fishing/be_a_pro.html|title=So You Want To Be A Bass Pro? {{!}} The Ultimate Bass Fishing Resource Guide® LLC|last=Guide|first=The Ultimate Bass Fishing Resource|website=www.bassresource.com|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most famous names in professional bass angling are [[Ray Scott (angler)|Ray Scott]], [[Kevin VanDam]], and [[Michael Iaconelli|Mike Iaconelli]].  Ray Scott is the founder of Bass Anglers Sportsman Society, otherwise known as BASS.  Ray Scott started BASS in 1967 and has paved the way for professional circuits by starting the BASS Tournament Trail.  Kevin VanDam is a professional competition angler who has won the BASSMASTER Classic four times. He also gained great fame by being named Angler of the Year in 1992.  Mike Iaconelli is a professional competition angler in the BASS Elite Series, who has made a name for himself by winning BASSMASTER Classic and the Toyota Elite Series AOY&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wideopenspaces.com/20-famous-bass-anglers-time-2/|title=20 Most Famous Bass Anglers of All Time - Wide Open Spaces|date=2014-10-12|website=Wide Open Spaces|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional bass angling salaries fluctuate greatly depending on how marketable the angler is, in 2006 Kevin VanDam made $500,000 from his sponsors while Mike Iaconelli made $370,000.  This does not include the prize money from winning competitions.  Although there are some professionals that earn this much money, it is not the case for all of them.  Gene Ellison the executive director of the Professional Anglers Association is quoted saying, "more than half of the guys out here this weekend are going broke", during the BASSMASTER Classic of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bassmaster.com/news/show-me-money|title=Show me the Money|website=Bassmaster|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the sport has not only reached out to men but to women as well.  There is a large following of women bass fishing who are trying to become professional and have their own women circuit.  The Lady Bass Anglers Association was started for just that purpose.  They aspire to create an industry in which women are able to compete professionally and help push the boundaries of professional bass angling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ladybassanglers.com/our-team/mission-statement.html|title=Mission Statement for the Lady Bass Anglers Association|website=www.ladybassanglers.com|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''DW Stadium''' is a sports stadium in [[Wigan]], [[Greater Manchester]], England. The ground is owned and managed by Wigan Football Company Limited, which is 78% owned by Wigan Athletic and it is used by [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] [[association football|football]] club and [[Wigan Warriors]] [[rugby league]] club, the rugby league club having a 50 years lease on tenancy to play games at the stadium.
Built and opened in 1999,&lt;ref name="jjbw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dwstadium.co.uk/facts.php |title=DW Stadium Facts &amp; figures |accessdate=8 August 2009 |work= |publisher=''DW Stadium official website'' |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822194903/http://www.dwstadium.co.uk/facts.php |archivedate=22 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is named after its main sponsor, [[DW Sports Fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wigan_athletic/7963855.stm |title=Wigan's JJB Stadium to be renamed | accessdate=4 July 2009 |publisher=''[[BBC News]]'' |date=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[UEFA]] matches, it is called '''Wigan Athletic Stadium''' due to UEFA regulations on sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2014/matches/round=2000469/match=2012530/postmatch/report/index.html UEFA Europa League 2013/14 - History - Wigan-Rubin – UEFA.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium architect was [[Alfred McAlpine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wiganwarriors.com/club/facilities/dw-stadium |title=DW Stadium: Wigan Warriors | accessdate=9 January 2016 |publisher=wiganwarriors.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors moved into it from their long-term homes of [[Springfield Park (Wigan)|Springfield Park]] and [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]] respectively. International rugby league matches have also taken place at the venue.

Its current capacity is 25,138—seated in four single-tier stands—and its record attendance was on 11 May 2008 when 25,133 people watched Wigan Athletic play [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the title-deciding match of the [[2007–08 Premier League]] season.&lt;ref name="jjbw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ManUtd2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UnitedPremier" /&gt;

== History ==
The stadium was designed by [[Alfred McAlpine]] and completed in August 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jjbstadium.co.uk/facts/ |publisher=The JJB Stadium |title=Facts and Figures |accessdate=2008-07-11| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080328153132/http://www.jjbstadium.co.uk/facts/| archivedate = 28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wigan Athletic had spent the previous 67 years playing at [[Springfield Park (Wigan)|Springfield Park]], and their first match at the stadium was a friendly against [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]], just before the stadium's official opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.11v11.com/index.php?pageID=545&amp;teamID=138 |title=Wigan Athletic: Statistics |accessdate=22 January 2009 |publisher=''The Football Genome Project'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium's inauguration was marked with a friendly between Wigan Athletic and neighbours [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] — who were then reigning [[UEFA Champions League|European champions]], [[Premier League]] title and [[FA Cup]] holders — with United's manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] officially opening the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wigan's JJB Stadium to be renamed|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wigan_athletic/7963855.stm|accessdate=4 November 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first competitive football match there took place on 7 August 1999, with Wigan Athletic facing [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in a [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] match. [[Simon Haworth]] scored twice, including the first competitive goal at the new stadium, as Athletic triumphed 3–0.&lt;ref name="DWRename"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/DWStadium/0,,10429,00.html |title=The DW Stadium |publisher=''[[Wigan Athletic F.C.]]'' |accessdate=4 August 2009 |last= |first= |date=27 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726003856/http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/DWStadium/0%2C%2C10429%2C00.html |archivedate=26 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wigan Warriors]] moved to the stadium a month after it opened, once they had played their final home game of the 1999 regular season at [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]], which had been the club's home since 1902. After their former ground was sold, the possibility of ground sharing with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.]] at the Reebok Stadium (now [[University of Bolton Stadium]]) was presented, but the new stadium in Wigan was chosen instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:DW Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A view of the DW Stadium, from the bridge crossing the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]]]
The first away team to win a competitive football match at the stadium was Wigan Athletic. A first round [[FA Cup]] tie against non-league [[Cambridge City F.C.|Cambridge City]] was played there due to City's ground being deemed unsuitable to host the tie. Wigan played in their changed strip and used the away dressing room since it was technically a 'home' game for Cambridge City. A [[Stuart Barlow]] brace secured the win for Wigan.&lt;ref name="DWRename" /&gt;
Wigan subsequently lost at home to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the third round of the FA Cup on 11 December 1999. [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] became the first team to beat Wigan in a league fixture at the JJB on 7 January 2000. The game was shown live on sky sports and finished 1–0 thanks to an 86th-minute header  from Lee Duxbury.

Whilst Wigan Warriors and Wigan Athletic flourished in the new stadium (Wigan Athletic in particular would achieve significant success, rising up the English [[English football league system|football pyramid]] to the Premier League by 2005), [[Orrell R.U.F.C.]] did not. [[Dave Whelan]] and [[Maurice Lindsay (rugby league)|Maurice Lindsay]] decided to invest heavily in the club, with the aim of having the club play in rugby union's [[Guinness Premiership]] at the stadium. After failing to win 2004's [[National Division Two]], Whelan pulled a large amount of investment from the club, to a more modest [[Pound sterling|GB£]]30,000 a year. This was the beginning of Orrell's demise, as players left during the summer of that year and the club were consequently relegated the season after. Ownership eventually passed from Lindsay back to the club's members, but by this point, Orrell had sold their former [[Edge Hall Road]] ground to Dave Whelan's company, Whelco Holdings, and therefore had no assets apart from their rebuilt clubhouse following a fire in 2002. Orrell never settled at the JJB Stadium, and were eventually de-professionalised at the end of the 2006–07 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moseleyrugby.co.uk/%5E%20PREVIEWS/Previews%200506/Preview%20-%20Orrell%20Away.htm |title=Big Match Preview – Orrell |publisher=''[[Moseley Rugby Football Club|Moseley Rugby]]'' |accessdate=25 July 2009 |last=Woodroofe |first=Peter |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823022054/http://www.moseleyrugby.co.uk/%5E%20PREVIEWS/Previews%200506/Preview%20-%20Orrell%20Away.htm |archivedate=23 August 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2370002/Orrell-squander-golden-chance-to-stop-the-rot.html|title=Orrell squander golden chance to stop the rot|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph.co.uk]]''|accessdate=25 July 2009|last=Bolton|first=Paul|date=19 December 2005|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 2005, [[Greater Manchester]] police announced that they would stop policing Wigan Athletic matches at the stadium from 2 April. This move would almost certainly have resulted in the stadium's safety certificate being revoked, effectively forcing the team to play behind closed doors. The move was part of an ongoing dispute between the police force and Dave Whelan surrounding GB£300,000 in unpaid policing costs. The police's decision would not have affected Wigan Warriors, whose games are stewarded instead of policed. The situation was temporarily resolved on 8 March with both sides reaching an agreement that would allow Athletic to play at the ground until the end of the season. Four months later, Wigan Athletic, facing the prospect of playing their home games in the Premier League in an empty stadium, grudgingly paid the money they owed to the police. The club successfully appealed against the payments in court and won damages from the police.&lt;ref name="GMP"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/7791618.stm |title=Police match cost appeal success |accessdate=20 January 2009|publisher=''[[BBC News]]'' |date=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September 2008, Wigan Warriors revealed plans to take their [[Super League]] Play-Off against [[Bradford Bulls]] to a neutral venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiganwarriors.com/news_full.asp?newsid=4179 |title=Change of Venue for Wigan Play-Off Game |accessdate=21 January 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Wigan Warriors]] |date=7 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616043803/http://www.wiganwarriors.com/news_full.asp?newsid=4179 |archivedate=16 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversial relocation was forced due to a fixture clash, with a match between football clubs Wigan Athletic and Sunderland to take place less than 24 hours after the Super League match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby_league/article4710185.ece |title=Wigan Warriors must pitch in at Widnes |accessdate=21 January 2009 |work= |publisher=''[[The Times]]''|last=Irvine|first=Christopher|date=9 September 2008  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="home from home"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''Engage Super League''|url=http://www.engagesuperleague.co.uk/article.php?id=11738|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822195609/http://www.engagesuperleague.co.uk/article.php?id=11738|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 August 2009|title=Wigan triumph at home from home|date=12 September 2008|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whelan, who controlled Wigan Athletic, refused permission for the Warriors to stage their elimination at the stadium, citing concerns over the playing surface.&lt;ref name="fananger"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/2706578/Wigan-Warriors-forced-to-change-venue-for-home-draw---Rugby-League.html |title=Super League play-off: Wigan Warriors forced to change venue for home draw |accessdate=21 January 2009|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph.co.uk]]'' |last=Burke|first=David|date=8 September 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was relocated to [[Widnes Vikings]]  home ground, the [[Halton Stadium|Stobart Stadium]].&lt;ref name="home from home" /&gt; In the same season, JJB Sports announced they would not continue to sponsor Wigan Warriors, leaving them without a main shirt sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wiganwarriors.com/news_full.asp?newsid=4084 |title=JJB to Step Down as Shirt Sponsors |accessdate=21 January 2009 |work= |publisher=''[[Wigan Warriors]]'' |date=30 July 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wigantoday.net/warriors/Warriors-still-hunting-for-sponsor.4777841.jp |title=Wigan still hunting for sponsor |accessdate=21 January 2001 |work= |publisher=''Wigan Today'' |last=Dewhurst|first=Tony|date= 10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium's average attendance has increased significantly since its opening in 1999. The Wigan Warriors' average attendance has increased by 32.5% from its first full season at the stadium in 2000, and Wigan Athletic's average attendance has increased by 181.2% from the 2000–01 season. The highest recorded attendance for a rugby league match is shared between three fixtures; the Wigan Warriors' fixture against [[St Helens R.F.C.]] on 25 March 2005; Game 4 of the 2005 Tri-Nations series between [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] on 6 November; and Game 5 of the 2004 Tri-Nations series between Great Britain and Australia on 13 November at 25,004 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:JJB Stadium East Stand.JPG|thumb|The eastern 'Boston Stand']]
In March 2009, Dave Whelan acquired a chain of fitness clubs from [[JJB Sports]]. In the process, Whelan used the business to set up a new venture, DWSportsfitness and announced that the stadium name would change to the ''DW Stadium'' in August.&lt;ref name="WiganDWRename"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wigantoday.net/wigannews/New-name-announced-for-stadium.5107979.jp|title=New name announced for stadium|publisher=''Wigan Today''|accessdate=25 March 2009|date=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whelan also announced that at the same time the stadium was renamed, its ownership would pass from himself to Wigan Athletic.&lt;ref name="AthleticOwnership"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/wigan-chairman-whelan-handing-stadium-ownership-club-251525 |title=Wigan chairman Whelan handing stadium ownership to club |publisher=''tribalfootball'' |accessdate=24 July 2009 |last= |first= |date=18 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824224733/http://www.tribalfootball.com/wigan-chairman-whelan-handing-stadium-ownership-club-251525 |archivedate=24 August 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about the future of Wigan Warriors were arrested in the same announcement, as Whelan extended the lease on the stadium by 50 years for the rugby league team.&lt;ref name="AthleticOwnership" /&gt; Before their match against [[Leeds Rhinos]] in July 2009, both clubs were given the opportunity to rename one stand, with the intention of renaming them in honour to a recognised player from each club's history. The rugby league club were granted the East Stand, which they renamed 'The Boston Stand' in tribute to the Welsh [[Wing (rugby league)|winger]] [[Billy Boston]],&lt;ref name="StandRename"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wigantoday.net/wigannews/Latics-and-Warriors-honoured-at.5487118.jp?CommentPage=1&amp;CommentPageLength=10|title=Latics and Warriors honoured at DW Stadium|publisher=''Wigan Today''|accessdate=24 July 2009|last=Graham|first=Charles|date=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wigan Athletic had spent many years in the lower leagues it was recognised that most of their players were not known, so the West Stand was renamed 'The Springfield Stand' after the club's former ground.&lt;ref name="StandRename" /&gt;

The stadium design is based on cantilevered, prefabricated steel roof and terrace structuring.&lt;ref name="jjbw"/&gt; It is an all-seater arena with a [[seating capacity]] of 24,826.&lt;ref name="jjbw" /&gt; The stands are rectangular and both the northern and southern stands have supporting steel girders suspended from beneath the roof. The four stands are of approximately the same height, however the stadium is not totally enclosed, leaving four exposed corners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballgroundguide.com/wigan_athletic/jjb_stadium.htm|title=Football Ground Guide: JJB Stadium|publisher=Football Ground Guide|accessdate=9 August 2009|last=Adams|first=Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At both Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors matches, away supporters are situated in the North Stand behind the goal.&lt;ref name="worldstadia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldstadia.com/stadium/england/jjb_stadium/101.php |title=JJB Stadium |accessdate=20 January 2009 |publisher=''worldstadia.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, during rugby games which attract low away support, the 5,418 capacity North Stand is closed altogether, and the away fans who attend are put into an alternative stand.&lt;ref name="jjbw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awaygrounds.com/wigan-athletic-jjb-stadium/|title=JJB Stadium|publisher=Away Grounds|accessdate=9 August 2009|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern stand, known as 'The Boston Stand', and the western 'Springfield Stand' run across the longer sides of the pitch. The Boston Stand is the largest, capable of seating up to 8,238 fans and holding an electronic scoreboard.&lt;ref name="jjbw"/&gt; The Springfield Stand contains the stadium's vital facilities; four dressing rooms, benches, a doping control room and a treatment room for the players, as well as four executive boxes, ten radio commentary points and a designated TV studio, in addition to holding 6,100 fans.&lt;ref name="jjbw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="facilities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiganwarriors.com/MidContent.asp?cid=21 |title=DW Stadium – Facts &amp; Figures |accessdate=22 January 2009 |publisher=''[[Wigan Warriors]]'' |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080502175505/http://www.wiganwarriors.com/MidContent.asp?cid=21 |archivedate = 2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Stand and South Stand have a seating capacity of 5,418 and 5,412 respectively.&lt;ref name="jjbw"/&gt; The stadium also has facilities and access for up to 278 fans with disabilities, with facilities for partially sighted fans.&lt;ref name=facilities/&gt; The seats are a mixture of both resident teams' main colours — cherry red and blue. The stadium is fully compliant with safety guidelines for a sports ground.&lt;ref name=facilities/&gt;

The pitch is large enough to conform with both [[FIFA]] and the standard rugby league requirements, at {{convert|110|x|60|m|yd}}. This leaves an in-goal area just {{convert|5|m|yd}} deep for rugby matches. It is mostly made of natural grass, with 2% of the pitch composed of synthetics to provide stability.&lt;ref name="jjbw"/&gt; The ground has irrigation, and an under-heating system to resist icy weather.&lt;ref name="jjbw" /&gt;

=== Wigan Warriors ===

[[Wigan Warriors]] moved from [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]] to the stadium in 1999 after the end of [[Super League IV]]'s regular season. Since moving to the new stadium, Wigan Warriors' success in [[rugby league]] has not been as high as it was at their old Central Park ground, however the good times do seem to be back for the club after they won the [[Super League Grand Final]] and League Leaders shield in 2010 under the guidance of coach [[Michael Maguire (rugby league)|Michael Maguire]] and chairman [[Ian Lenagan]].

Attendances have generally risen for the Wigan Warriors since the start of the 2002 season, averaging around 14,000 over the three seasons from 2006 to 2009. Aside from Grand Finals, the largest Super League attendance was recorded at the stadium in 2005 when Wigan Warriors played their local rivals, [[St Helens R.F.C.]].&lt;ref name="warriors05" /&gt;

This match is also the highest home attendance in the Wigan Warriors' history at the stadium. The twenty thousand mark has been broken ten times since moving to the new stadium in 1999—eight times against St Helens RLFC, once against local rivals [[Warrington Wolves]] in the opening round of the 2008 [[Super League XIII]] season, and once in July 2009 against the [[Leeds Rhinos]] following a campaign advertising the game as the 'Big One'.&lt;ref name="RLP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BigOne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/rugby-league-headlines/Leeds-Rhinos-Wigan-clash-is.5490606.jp |title=Leeds Rhinos: Wigan clash is not the Big One! |publisher=''[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]'' |accessdate=25 July 2009 |last=Smith |first=Peter |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726063510/http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/rugby-league-headlines/Leeds-Rhinos-Wigan-clash-is.5490606.jp |archivedate=26 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Warriors were officially the biggest supported team in the Super League.

Rising success on the pitch has been met with increased attendances. Promotion into the Premier League meant that in their first season of English top-flight [[Association football|football]], Wigan Athletic's average home attendance almost doubled from the season before. Over three times more fans attended matches at the stadium during Wigan's 2007–08 season in the Premier League than had attended in the 2001–02 season when Wigan Athletic were in the Football League Second Division. Wigan Athletic's average home attendance for 2007–08 was the lowest out of all 20 teams in the Premier League, failing to make the top 30 English clubs in terms of attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballeconomy.com/stats/stats_att_04.htm|title=Top 30 English Football Clubs by League Attendances|publisher=''Political Economy of Football''|accessdate=25 July 2009|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same season saw the highest ever attendance at the stadium, when 25,133 people witnessed Wigan play [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on the final day of the season.&lt;ref name="ManUtd2008" /&gt;

[[File:Great Britain - New Zealand rugby league test, 2007.jpg|thumb|The final home Test for [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] against New Zealand, played at the stadium in 2007]]
As well as the fixtures for the two domestic teams, the stadium is a venue for international rugby league. Since the stadium's construction in 1999, it has been an ever-present venue whenever International series have been played in England.

Its first involvement came during the [[2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations|2004 series]], where the home [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain and Ireland national team]] defeated the [[Australian national rugby league team|Australians]] 24–12, with [[Terry Newton]] and [[Andy Farrell]] both scoring in their home town of Wigan.&lt;ref name="Tri-Nations2004" /&gt; The venue was again selected for the [[2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations|2005 series]], and again the match was between Great Britain and Australia—this time the home team lost 6–20—with [[Greater Manchester]] born [[Adrian Morley]] scoring Great Britain's solitary try.&lt;ref name="Tri-Nations2005" /&gt; Both matches were complete sell-outs, each having attendances above 25,000. The match in 2004 was the third highest attendance of the series, coming behind a match at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]] between Great Britain and Australia, and the series final between the same two teams at [[Elland Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/43|title=Tri-Nations 2004|publisher=''Rugby League Project''|accessdate=5 August 2009|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Tri-Nations, the stadium has also played host to visiting nations during their European tours. Australia played Great Britain in front of a sell-out crowd during the [[2001 Kangaroo tour]], with the home side losing 8–28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/6878 |title=Ashes Series 2001 |accessdate=21 January 2009 |publisher=''Rugby League Project'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia narrowly defeated Great Britain again in 2003 at the stadium, winning by a margin of four points during their [[2003 Kangaroo tour|2003 European Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/2479 |title=Ashes Series 2003 |accessdate=21 January 2009|publisher=''Rugby League Project'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] have also played at the stadium during their tours. In 2002, a try scored in his home town by [[Martin Gleeson]] helped Great Britain to defeat the 'Kiwis' 16–10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/14407 |title=Great Britain vs New Zealand 2002 |accessdate=21 January 2009|publisher=''Rugby League Project'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The visitors lost again during their 2007 tour, this time 28–22 in a closely fought game in which Wigan-born [[Second-row forward|second-rower]] [[Sean O'Loughlin]] featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/14125 |title=Great Britain vs New Zealand 2007 |accessdate=21 January 2009|publisher=''Rugby League Project'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium has hosted the [[World Club Challenge]] four times, in [[2000 World Club Challenge|2000]], between [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] and the [[Melbourne Storm]] in [[2011 World Club Challenge|2011]] when [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] took on [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/14554|title=World Club Challenge 2000|publisher=''Rugby League Project''|accessdate=25 July 2009|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 and 2016 when Wigan Warriors hosted the Brisbane Brochos.

Since its opening in 1999, it hosted six [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] internationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/Custom/LS0tMS0tNjQtLS0tLS0tLXkteS0tLS0tLQ== |title=DW Stadium|work=Rugby League Project|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wigan skyline 2008.jpg|thumb|left|The Wigan skyline, featuring the stadium]]
The stadium's surroundings are mostly urban, as it is located in the north of Wigan's Robin Park retail complex in the western suburb of Newtown, on the south bank of the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]], west of the Miry Lane industrial estate. The stadium's car parks are situated around the canal, and can hold up to 2,500 cars.&lt;ref name="jjbw"/&gt;

Next to the stadium's South Stand lies the '''Robin Park Arena''',&lt;ref name="Robin Park locations"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/JuniorStripes/0,,10429~1742220,00.html |title=Upcoming Pre-match Entertainment |publisher=[[Wigan Athletic F.C.]] |accessdate=9 August 2009 |last= |first= |date=3 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818032618/http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/JuniorStripes/0%2C%2C10429~1742220%2C00.html |archivedate=18 August 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is operated by Wigan Sports Development Unit and is capable of seating 1,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlct.org/Sport/rparena/rparena.htm |title=Robin Park Sports Centre &amp; Arena |publisher=Wigan Leisure &amp; Culture Trust |accessdate=9 August 2009 |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529141857/http://www.wlct.org/sport/rparena/rparena.htm |archivedate=29 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena is mainly used for [[track and field athletics|athletics]], as well as functions for: [[North West Counties Football League]] side [[Wigan Robin Park]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vodkatleague.com/index.php?page=wigan-robin-park|title=Wigan Robin Park|publisher=[[North West Counties League]] website|accessdate=9 August 2009|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wigan Athletic Reserves.

'''Dartford Cricket Club''' is one of the oldest [[cricket]] clubs in England with origins which date from the early 18th century, perhaps earlier. The earliest known match involving a team from Dartford took place in 1722, against [[London Cricket Club|London]],&lt;ref&gt;ACS, ''Important Matches'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; but the club's own website says it was formally established in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dartfordcc.co.uk/our-history/club-history |title=Dartford Cricket Club – History |publisher=Dartford Cricket Club |accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club is extant and now plays in the [[Kent Cricket League]].

==History==
Dartford players were reckoned by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford]], writing in his diary in 1723, to "lay claim to the greatest excellence" among English cricketers. The club played a number of big matches against [[London Cricket Club|London]] and, in 1756, they were involved in a tri-series against the sport's rising power, the [[Hambledon Club]].

Dartford produced several famous players in the 18th century including cricket's earliest known great player [[William Bedle]]. Later players included [[William Hodsoll]], [[John Bell (Kent cricketer)|John Bell]], [[John Frame (cricketer)|John Frame]] and [[Ned Wenman]].

The club originally used [[Dartford Brent]], an area of common land, as its ground. By the end of the 18th century it had moved to [[Bowman's Lodge]] on [[Dartford Heath]] before its current ground at [[Hesketh Park (cricket ground)|Hesketh Park]] was established in 1905. In 2002 the club merged with Dartford Halls Cricket Club, retaining the name Dartford Cricket Club for its First XI.&lt;ref name=ko21mar02&gt;[http://www.kentonline.co.uk/dartford/sport/merger-gives-towns-cricket-more-a2731/ Merger gives town's cricket more clout], ''[[Kent Online]]'', 2002-03-21.

[[File:Leeds United AFC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|300px|Leeds United's historical League position; their fall from grace follows the [[2000–01 UEFA Champions League|2000–01 Champions League semi-final]].]]
"'''Doing a Leeds'''" is an [[Football in England|English football]] phrase which has become synonymous with the potential dire consequences for domestic [[football club|clubs]] of [[financial mismanagement]], following the rapid decline in the 2000s of [[Leeds United F.C.]], a [[Premier League]] club that invested heavily to reach the semi-finals of the lucrative [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] European competition, but in the process built up large debts. The club suffered a "financial meltdown" after failing to continue to qualify for the competition, and subsequently dropped down two levels of the [[English football league system|football pyramid]], into the third tier, [[Football League One]], for the first time in their history.

Since the creation of the [[Premier League]], a total of 22 of its former clubs have been relegated to the third tier (League One), of which six fell down further into the fourth tier ([[Football League Two]]). Because they had never experienced relegation to League One or its predecessors until it actually happened in 2007, Leeds was the object of careful observation by media and derision by rival fans.

==The fall of Leeds United==
{{further|Leeds United F.C.#2001–2007: Financial implosion and relegation}}
As champions of the final [[Football League First Division|First Division]] season, Leeds United were one of the inaugural 22 clubs of the [[Premier League]], the breakaway top division league competition formed in 1992. Leeds had sustained success in the league in late 1990s, and ultimately reached the semi-finals of the [[2000–01 UEFA Champions League|2000–01 Champions League]]. Their level of spending to do so however had exceeded all other clubs, and the club's debt level rose annually from £9m to £21m, £39m, £82m and peaked at around £119m, much of the money having been spent on [[Transfer (association football)|transfer fees]] and players' wages. After the club failed to qualify for the [[2002–03 UEFA Champions League|2002–03 Champions League]] by only finishing fifth in the Premier League, it had to make drastic savings by selling players as it could no longer sustain the debt repayments, which relied on the ticket sales and television income from the European competition.&lt;ref name=Herald17Feb2007/&gt;

At the end of the [[2003–04 FA Premier League]] season, Leeds United were relegated to the [[2004–05 Football League|Football League Championship]]. The financial effects continued, and with one game to go in the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07 season]], the club voluntarily entered [[Administration (law)|administration]], incurring a 10-point league penalty, resulting in relegation to League One, the first time the club had ever been in the third tier of English football.&lt;ref name=BBC4May2007/&gt; Subsequent breaches of financial rules in the summer nearly resulted in the club being expelled from the Football League altogether (a fate which coincidentally had befallen the club's predecessors, [[Leeds City F.C.|Leeds City]]), but they were ultimately re-admitted with a 15-point penalty to apply to the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08 season]]. Despite further appeals, the penalty stood and ultimately cost the club promotion that season. 

At the end of the [[2009–10 Leeds United F.C. season|2009–10]] season, the club was promoted back to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] after a final day victory. They have been in the Championship ever since, coming closest to earning promotion back to the Premier League in the [[2016–17 Leeds United F.C. season|2016–17]]  season, where the club under the management of [[Garry Monk]] narrowly missed out on a play-off spot, finishing 7th in the league and earning their highest points total in a Championship season throughout their most recent period of tenure in the division.

==Similar cases==
Leeds United's decline was not entirely without historical precedent, as [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] had suffered a similarly high-profile decline in the 1980s, finishing 6th in the old First Division and winning the [[Football League Cup]] in 1980, before eventually dropping into the old Fourth Division by 1986 on the back of three consecutive relegations. [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] had become the first league team to suffer three successive relegations when they went down to the Fourth Division in 1982, although their decline was less dramatic as that of Wolves, as they had spent just four seasons in the First Division and not been as successful or spent as much money on players.

However, the decline of Wolverhampton Wanderers was widely seen as the culmination of decades of financial mismanagement rather than an extreme amount of short-term spending as was the case with Leeds. Wolves had paid a national record fee of nearly £1.5million to sign striker [[Andy Gray (footballer, born 1955)|Andy Gray]] from [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1979, while spending an even greater sum of money of rebuilding one side of the ground to create a large all-seater stand at around the same time.

Contemporaneous to Leeds, [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], who were relegated from the Championship alongside them in 2007, suffered an even more severe decline and underwent three consecutive relegations, ending up in the [[National League (English football)|Football Conference]] by 2009; they too had been hit by financial problems. Luton had been in the top tier of English Football as recently as the [[1991–92 in English football|1991-92]] season. They did not reclaim their league status for five seasons.

[[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], who climbed from the Fourth Division to the First Division between 1978 and 1981, finished sixth in the [[1981-82 in English football|1981-82 season]], having led the league several times that season. However, they were relegated a year later and went down again in 1984, suffering a third relegation in four seasons in 1986 after they had almost gone out of business.

[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], who matched Swansea's record of climbing three divisions in four seasons in 1986, survived in the top flight of English football for 14 years and won the [[FA Cup]] in 1988 before being relegated from the [[Premier League]] in 2000. They were relegated from Division One four years later, after which they were renamed [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] following their relocation to [[Milton Keynes]]. The renamed club suffered yet another relegation to the league's fourth tier in 2006. It would have gone down the previous year had it not been for a 10-point deduction imposed on financially troubled [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]], whose financial situation nearly saw them expelled from the Football League.

In 1998, [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City's]] relegation to Division Two made them the second former winners of a European trophy to be relegated to the third tier of their domestic league (after 1974 Cup Winners Cup winners [[1. FC Magdeburg|Magdeburg]] in 1991, though that had happened because the [[East German football league system|league system]] of the former [[East Germany]] had contributed with less clubs in proportion to the [[German football league system|unified system]] after 1990; the English system by contrast remained the same); they had been [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] winners in 1970. City had faced constant struggles in the league since heavy spending on players in the late 1970s and early 1980s had failed to translate into silverware; they were relegated from the First Division twice during the 1980s, returning after two seasons on both occasions. Similar heavy spending on players in the early 1990s again failed to deliver silverware, and City went down from the [[FA Premier League]] at the end of its fourth season in 1996 after narrowly avoiding relegation in the previous two seasons. A second relegation took them down to Division Two in 1998, but this was followed by two consecutive promotions.

In 2005, [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] became the first former winners of the [[European Cup]] (which they had won in 1979 and 1980) to be relegated to the third tier of their domestic league. Having also won a league title and four League Cups between 1978 and 1990, they had been relegated at the end of the first Premier League season in 1993, promoted back at the first attempt, gone down again in 1997 and achieved an instant return to the Premier League in 1998, only to be relegated a year later. They have not returned to the Premier League since their 1999 relegation, although they did climb out of the third tier (League One) after three seasons.

In 2004, [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] became the first former members of the English top flight to be relegated from the [[Football League]]; their solitary season in the top flight was in the [[Football League First Division]] in the [[1974-75 in English football|1974-75 season]], and they in fact led the English league after winning their opening three games of that league campaign. 

In 2006, the 1986 [[Football League Cup]] winners [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] became the first former winners of a major trophy to be relegated from the Football League. They returned to the league four years later. Other clubs who have fallen from the old First Division to the [[National League (English football)|National League]] include the aforementioned Luton Town, [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]].

In 2017 and 2018, [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] were relegated twice in successive seasons (from the Premier League to the Championship and then to League One).

=="Doing a Leeds"==
The term "doing a Leeds" or to "do a Leeds" has since become synonymous with financial mismanagement of a football club with potential dire consequences. It can refer specifically to any club that fails to plan adequately for the financial impact of either failure to qualify for the Champions League, or of not adequately restructuring following relegation from the [[Premier League]] to avoid a further drop, or more generally, to the rapid demise in the relative standing of any club.&lt;ref name=Herald17Feb2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times20Feb2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times25March2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian23Mar2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Journal24Mar2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mirror28May2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph29Apr2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times16jan2007/&gt;

Managers and chairmen, although sometimes obliged to "chase the dream"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/7879229.stm "Pompey pay for chasing the dream"], ''[[BBC Sport]]'', 11 February 2009. Retrieved 11 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/mancity/7090829/Manchester-City-making-their-voice-heard-as-United-pushed-all-the-way-in-Carling-Cup.html "Manchester City making their voice heard as United pushed all the way in Carling Cup"]&gt;, telegraph.co.uk, 28 January 2010. Retrieved 11 February 2010. "The cocky pretenders always seem to push it too far when they are chasing the dream, but they are not always left eating their words."&lt;/ref&gt; (the inevitable precursor of "doing a Leeds"), are often forced to deny they are "doing a Leeds" in the wake of a large investment that some analysts predict cannot be afforded by their club and may overstretch their budget.&lt;ref name=BirminghamMail24Nov2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheSun12Jan2005/&gt; Similarly, fans may fear their club will "do a Leeds" if its expensively acquired and maintained team is unable to qualify for the Champions League&lt;ref name=DailyPost6Feb2003/&gt; or is relegated from the Premier League, thereby failing to "live the dream".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2010/feb/10/portsmouth-cardiff-hmrc-winding-up "Crunched creditors call time on living the dream"], guardian.co.uk. Retrieved 11 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the avoidance of "doing a Leeds" has been invoked by managers to justify selling their best players in order to raise funds to stave off going into administration, which might lead to a relegation-inducing penalty.&lt;ref name=TheSun6Feb2004/&gt; Failure to invest at the expected "normal" rate in order to maintain a particular club's league position can even be labelled as "doing a Leeds".&lt;ref name=IrishIndependent7Dec2008/&gt;

The phrase was notably used during the relegation of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2009, one of the largest clubs to be relegated from the Premier League. Having bought the club, new owner [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] stated that his investment had in fact saved the club from "doing a Leeds".&lt;ref name=Telegraph15Sep2008/&gt; In spite of this Newcastle suffered relegation at the end of the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09 season]], sparking fears both before and after that the club could "do a Leeds" and drop further, into League One, without restructuring.&lt;ref name=IrishIndependent2Aug2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mail25May2009/&gt; However, the club avoided this and bounced back the following season with automatic first place promotion.

The 2010 announcement of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United's]] need to refinance their large debt as a bond issue following their purchase by [[Malcolm Glazer]] led to questions in the media whether even Manchester United, as the most successful Premier League-era club, could be in danger of "doing a Leeds".&lt;ref name=Guardian12Jan2010/&gt;

[[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] were referred to as the "Irish version of Leeds United" after winning the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] in 2006 but being automatically demoted into the [[League of Ireland First Division]] for financial reasons.

The term has been applied to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], who amassed debts which eventually saw them become the first Premier League club to enter administration in February of the [[2009–10 in English football|2009–10 season]], leading to relegation in the same season after the subsequent nine-point penalty. [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] were relegated to League One after the [[2011–12 in English football|2011–12 season]] of the Football League Championship, due to a 10-point deduction for entering administration; a near-identical scenario to what occurred to Leeds five years previously. They were again relegated after a 10-point deduction due to failing to pay footballing creditors, this time to League Two, in the [[2012–13 in English football|2012–13 season]].

[[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] are another team guilty of "Doing a Leeds", after enjoying a successful stint in the [[Premier League]] under [[Sam Allardyce]], which culminated in qualifying for both the [[2006–07 UEFA Cup|2006–07]] and [[2007–08 UEFA Cup]], reaching the last 16 in the latter, which included a draw and a victory against [[Atlético Madrid]], and draws against [[Bayern Munich]],and [[Sporting Lisbon]]. After Allardyce's departure, the club began a steady decline, with relegation battles being a regular feature. [[Owen Coyle]] led Bolton on a successful cup campaign of the [[2010–11 FA Cup]], reaching the semi-final stage where [[Stoke City]] despatched the Trotters 5–0. This began a rapid decline that ultimately led to relegation on the last day of the 2011–12 season. The club mounted a late charge for the playoffs in [[2012–13 in English football|2012–13 season]], falling just short after a final day 2–2 draw to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] at [[Macron Stadium|home]]. Since then, the club announced debts of £172.9m in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32138946|title = Bolton Wanderers: Debt figure up to £172.9m after losses|website = BBC Sport|access-date = 2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were relegated to League One in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35948738|title = Derby County 4-1 Bolton Wanderers - BBC Sport|website = BBC Sport|access-date = 2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar phrase, "Doing a Bradford" was coined by former [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] player [[Simon Garner]] in 2012, a scenario that he was worried could befall his former club following their relegation from the Premier League. Garner was referring to Leeds's neighbours [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], who were a Premier League club in 2001, but had fallen three divisions to League Two in 2007 and were not promoted back to League One until the end of the 2012–13 season; the only other former Premier League clubs to have fallen to League Two are [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] (in 2006 and then 2011, and unlike Bradford they immediately gained promotion back to League One on both occasions), [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], Coventry City and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18179313|title = Former Blackburn striker Simon Garner raises fresh fears|last = Johnston|first = Neil|website = BBC Sport|access-date = 2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ralf Rangnick|Ralf Rangrick]], sporting director of [[RB Leipzig|Red Bull Leipzig]], compared in March 2017 the mismanagement of [[TSV 1860 Munich]] to that of Leeds United, drawing direct parallels between the ownership and resulting fan dissatisfaction at both clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2017/03/13/ralf-rangnick-compares-1860-munich-troubles-to-those-at-leeds-un/|title=Ralf Rangnick compares 1860 Munich troubles to those at Leeds United|last=Nash|first=Mathew|work=Here Is The City|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two clubs in fact met in a Champions League fixture in 2000, before both experiencing relegation from their respective top flight leagues in the following seasons. Neither club has returned to the highest division in their country since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/893346.stm|title=BBC SPORT {{!}} LEEDS UNITED {{!}} 1860 Munich v Leeds clockwatch|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex is known for its 10,568-seat [[American football|football]] &amp; [[soccer]] stadium but it is also home to a large [[natatorium]].  In 2010, NISD announced a three-year agreement that allowed the [[UTSA Roadrunners football]] team to use the stadium for practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goutsa.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=315549&amp;SPID=34919&amp;DB_OEM_ID=13100&amp;ATCLID=204967789 |title=Banner Day for UTSA Football |publisher=[[UTSA Roadrunners]] |date=2010-07-13 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canadian National Exhibition Stadium''' (commonly known as '''Exhibition Stadium''' and '''CNE Stadium''') was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] that formerly stood on the [[Exhibition Place]] grounds, in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Originally built for [[Canadian National Exhibition]] events, the stadium served as the home of the [[Toronto Argonauts]] of the [[Canadian Football League]], from [[1959 CFL season|1959]]–[[1988 CFL season|1988]], the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] of [[Major League Baseball]] from [[1977 Major League Baseball season|1977]]–[[1989 Major League Baseball season|1989]], and the [[Toronto Blizzard (1971–84)|Toronto Blizzard]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] from [[1979 North American Soccer League season|1979]]–[[1983 North American Soccer League season|1983]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Beard |first=Randy |title=Blizzard Hope Revenge Snowballs The Rowdies|date=April 25, 1979|newspaper=Evening Independent|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19790425&amp;id=bgEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=61gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2260,2414559&amp;hl=en|page=1C|accessdate=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Beard |first=Randy |title=Down 3 more teams, but NASL is stronger|date=May 4, 1984|newspaper=Evening Independent|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19840504&amp;id=FMNaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=i1kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2443,1156313&amp;hl=en|page=6C|accessdate=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stadium hosted the [[Grey Cup]] game 12 times over a 24-year period.

In 1999, the stadium was demolished and the site was used for parking until 2006. [[BMO Field]] was built on the site in 2007 roughly where the northern end of the covered grandstand once stood.

The grandstand (known as '''CNE Grandstand''') was used extensively throughout the summer months for hosting concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnearchives.com/download/Grandstand%20Performers%201948-1994.htm |title=1985 CNE Grandstand Performers |publisher=Cnearchives.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===CNE Grandstand===
Exhibition Stadium was the fourth stadium to be built on its site since 1879.&lt;ref name=noteworthy&gt;{{cite news|title=The noteworthy and not-so-worthy Ex Stadium has survived fires, storms and seagulls|date=1989-05-23|first=Robert|last=Brehl|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the original grandstand was lost due to a fire in 1906, it was quickly rebuilt.&lt;ref name=noteworthy/&gt;  A second fire destroyed the stadium in 1947, which led to the city constructing a covered north-side grandstand (known as CNE Grandstand) for {{CAD|3 million}} in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='To Cost Over 4 Million,' Asks Grandstand Probe|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=1948-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fireworks Over CNE: Council Would Let Ex Boss Grandstand, Field; Fiery Aldermen Object|date=1948-11-02|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=By Jim Coleman|last=Coleman|first=Jim|date=1948-09-29|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sweet reason|first=Frank|last=Tumpane|date=1949-12-07|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spring Rehabilitation: Offer to Improve CNE Sports Field For 1950 Grey Cup|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=1949-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the stadium's structure stayed even as the stadium underwent various changes until its 1999 closure.

Many rock concerts were also held at the stadium, both the grandstand and the whole stadium were used for popular rock acts such as [[The Who]], [[U2]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Van Halen]], [[Kim Mitchell]], [[Bruce Springsteen]],  [[Bon Jovi]], and [[AC/DC]].

===Expansion for CFL football===
[[File:Exhibition Stadium Grey Cup 1959.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Exhibition Stadium with the 1959 expansion during the [[47th Grey Cup]]]]
When the [[Toronto Argonauts]] moved from [[Varsity Stadium]] for the 1959 season, a smaller {{CAD|650,000}} bleacher section was added along the south sideline.&lt;ref name=noteworthy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=With $450,000 Stake the City couldn't lose, it was said, but it did|date=1960-08-05|last=Westall|first=Stanley|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CNE Stadium Muddle|date=1959-11-24|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this form the stadium seated 33,150.&lt;ref&gt;Toronto Argonauts 1959 Fact Book, inside front cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural game at the renovated Exhibition Stadium was an [[Chicago Cardinals–Toronto Argonauts exhibition game|exhibition interleague game between the]] hometown [[Toronto Argonauts]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) and the [[Chicago Cardinals (NFL, 1920–59)|Chicago Cardinals]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) on August 5, 1959. The game was the first time a [[National Football League in Toronto|NFL team played in Toronto]].&lt;ref name=Teitel&gt;{{cite book |last=Teitel |first=Jay |date=1983 |title=The Argo Bounce  |location=Toronto, Ontario |publisher= Lester and Orpen Dennys|isbn=0-88619-033-9 |pages= 54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CP&gt;{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19590806&amp;id=o9gxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kOQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7096,863998|title=Argos Smothered By Cardinals And Lose Norm Stoneburgh|date=August 6, 1959 |agency=Canadian Press |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first [[List of National Football League games played outside the United States|NFL–CFL exhibition match]] held since the establishment of the CFL in 1958, and marked the beginning of a three-year, four game exhibition series between the leagues.

When the [[58th Grey Cup]] was played at the stadium in 1970, [[Calgary Stampeders]] coach [[Jim Duncan (defensive end)|Jim Duncan]] described the condition of the natural-grass surface as "a disgrace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History - Grey Cup - 1970 |url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1970 |work=Canadian Football League website |publisher=Canadian Football League |accessdate=23 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823210808/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1970 |archivedate=23 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1972, [[Metropolitan Toronto]] Council voted 15–9 to spend $625,000 to install [[AstroTurf|artificial turf]]. The vote passed despite five councillors changing their vote to oppose the motion, because the cost had increased from a previous estimate of $400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sports to boom at CNE stadium with mod sod|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=January 26, 1972|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, contracts totaling {{CAD|475,000}} were approved to install the AstroTurf, with work to be completed by June, in time for the start of the Toronto Argonauts' 1972 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Estimate was $625,000: CNE artificial sod to cost $475,000|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=March 29, 1972|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconfiguration for baseball===
In 1974, in a bid to acquire a [[Major League Baseball]] team, the city voted to reconfigure the stadium to make it compatible for baseball,&lt;ref name=startfall&gt;{{cite news|title=Work could start this fall: Metro votes 23 to 6 to enlarge the CNE Stadium|date=1974-02-27|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|last=Simpson|first=Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the arrival of Major League Baseball in Toronto in 1977 in the form of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] (however, the initial plan for an MLB team called for the [[San Francisco Giants]] to move to Toronto; the proposed move fell through&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/sports/2008/06/28/death_of_the_giants_birth_of_the_jays.html&lt;/ref&gt;).

Originally planned to cost {{CAD|15 million}}&lt;ref name=startfall/&gt; before growing to {{CAD|17.5 million}}, the renovations, which were funded by the city and province, added seating opposite to the covered grandstand on the first base side and curving around to the third base side.&lt;ref name=noteworthy/&gt;&lt;ref name=thedays&gt;{{cite news|title=Those were the days? Exhibition Stadium had it all: cold and rain and shivering fans. "Enough's enough", declared two sports nuts, vowing to build a dome|date=1989-05-23|first=Robert|last=Brehl|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CNE Stadium: $17.8 million home for baseball|date=1976-06-05|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|first=Neil|last=MacCarl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blue Jays score in millions for Metro|date=1977-07-18|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|first=Michael|last=Best}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forum music, CNE noise: Will they ever co-exist?|first=Bruce|last=Kirkland|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=1977-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Football capacity was increased from 33,000 to 55,000.&lt;ref name=startfall/&gt; Although the stadium was expanded to accommodate baseball, the new seats were first used for football and allowed the [[64th Grey Cup]] in November 1976 to be watched by a then-Grey Cup record crowd of 53,467. For baseball, the stadium originally seated 38,522, however by the Blue Jays' second season this increased to 43,739,&lt;ref name="Cathedrals"/&gt; although, only about 33,000 seats were usually made available (see below).

Even in its new form, Exhibition Stadium was problematic for hosting both baseball and football. Blue Jays' President Paul Beeston noted Exhibition Stadium "wasn't just the worst stadium in baseball, it was the worst stadium in sports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macleod|first1=Robert|title=Paul Beeston heads for the bench|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/paul-beeston-heads-for-the-bench/article26425321/|accessdate=30 September 2015|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baseball problems====
[[File:Blue Jays v White Sox 1977.jpg|thumb|left|275px|A Toronto Blue Jays game during the 1977 season]]
Like most multi-purpose stadiums, the lower boxes were set further back than comparable seats at baseball-only stadiums to accommodate the wider football field. Compared to U.S. stadiums, this was magnified by the fact Canadian football fields are almost 34% larger than [[American football]] fields.{{efn|group=note|Until the CFL end zones were reduced in 1986, the Canadian field was {{convert|40|yards|m|abbr=out}} longer and {{convert|35|feet|m|abbr=out}} wider.}}
Many of the seats down the right-field line and in right-centre were extremely far from the infield; they actually faced each other rather than the action. Some seats were as far as {{convert|820|feet|m|abbr=out}} from home plate — the greatest such distance of any stadium ever used as a principal home field in the major leagues.&lt;ref name="Cathedrals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowry|first=Phillip|title=Green Cathedrals|year=2005|publisher=Walker &amp; Company|location=New York City|isbn=0-8027-1562-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These seats were rarely sold, except when necessitated by demand during the 1985 pennant race and playoffs, and again in the 1987 pennant race. 
As the original grandstand was used for the outfield seats, these were the cheapest seats but were the only ones which offered some protection from the elements;&lt;ref name="Storied"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Curt|authorlink=Curt Smith (author)|title=Storied Stadiums|year=2001|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|location=New York City|isbn=0-7867-1187-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Blue Jays were the only MLB team using a stadium with such a configuration.

====Football problems====
Because the full length of the third-base line had to be fitted between the north stand (the original grandstand) and the new south stand, they could no longer be parallel to each other. As a compromise between placements suitable for the two stands, the football field was rotated anticlockwise away from the north stand.&lt;ref&gt;Illustration at: {{cite web
|url=http://football.ballparks.com/CFL/Toronto/oldindex.htm
|title=Exhibition Stadium
|accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the only seats as close to the field as before were those near the eastern end zone, and no seats had as good a view of the whole field as the centre-field seats before the conversion.

Although the Argonauts recorded average attendances of above 40,000 fans per game in the first few seasons following the stadium's expansion, by the mid-1980s average attendance had fallen to less than 30,000 fans per game.

===Problems with the wind and cold===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ExhibitionStadium.jpg|thumb|right|275px|alt=A baseball field photographed from behind home plate, with an outfield fence and seating visible. The outfield is covered in snow, the infield has been cleared of snow, and some people are standing to the left.|April 7, 1977. A snow-covered field prior to the first Toronto Blue Jays game at Exhibition Stadium.]] --&gt;
Being situated relatively close to [[Lake Ontario]], the stadium was often quite cold at the beginning and end of the baseball season (and the end of the football season). The first Blue Jays game played there on April 7, 1977 was the only major league game ever played with the field covered entirely by snow. The Blue Jays had to borrow [[Maple Leaf Gardens]]' [[Ice resurfacer|Zamboni]] to clear off the field. Conditions at the stadium led to another odd incident that first year. On September 15, [[Baltimore Orioles]] manager [[Earl Weaver]] pulled his team off the field because he felt the bricks holding down the bullpen tarps were a hazard to his players. This garnered a win by [[forfeit (baseball)|forfeit]] for the Jays – the only time in major league baseball history since 1914 that a team deliberately forfeited a game (as opposed to having an umpire call a forfeiture).&lt;ref&gt;https://cooperstownersincanada.com/2013/01/23/remembering-the-game-that-earl-weaver-forfeited-at-exhibition-stadium/&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 30, 1984 game against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] was postponed due to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} winds. Before the game, Rangers manager [[Doug Rader]] named [[Jim Bibby]] as his starting pitcher, stating "he's the heaviest man in the world, and thus will be unaffected by the wind." However, Bibby would never make it to the mound. Two Rangers batters complained about dirt swirling in their eyes, and Blue Jays starting pitcher [[Jim Clancy (baseball)|Jim Clancy]] was blown off balance several times. The umpires stopped the game after only six pitches. After a 30-minute delay, the game was called off.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/once-upon-a-city-archives/2016/03/31/once-upon-a-city-mistake-by-the-lakes-troubled-place-in-toronto-history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium also occasionally had problems with fog, once causing a bizarre [[inside-the-park home run]] for [[Kelly Gruber]], when an otherwise routine pop up was lost by the outfielders in the thick fog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2013-06-13 |title=Tigers in a Fog as Blue Jays romp to win |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |agency=Canadian Press  |access-date=2016-06-23 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3BoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RagFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2774%2C1553161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a popular feeding ground for seagulls===
Due to its position next to the lake, and the food disposed by baseball and football fans, the stadium was a popular feeding ground for [[seagull]]s. [[New York Yankees]] outfielder [[Dave Winfield]] was arrested on August 4, 1983 for killing a seagull with a baseball. Winfield had just finished his warm-up exercises in the 5th inning and threw a ball to the [[ball boy]], striking a seagull in the head. The seagull died, and some claimed that Winfield hit the bird on purpose, which prompted Yankees [[Baseball manager|manager]] [[Billy Martin]] to state "They wouldn't say that if they'd seen the throws he'd been making all year. It's the first time he's hit the cutoff man". The charges were later dropped. Winfield would later play for the Blue Jays, winning a [[World Series]] with the club in 1992.

===70th Grey Cup and replacement===
Exhibition Stadium's fate was sealed during the [[70th Grey Cup]] in 1982, popularly known as "the Rain Bowl" because it was played in a driving rainstorm that left most of the crowd drenched.  Many of the seats were completely exposed to the elements, forcing thousands of fans to watch the game in the concession section.  To make matters worse, the washrooms overflowed.  In attendance that day was then-Ontario [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] [[Bill Davis]], and the poor conditions were seen by over 7,862,000 television viewers in Canada (at the time the largest TV audience ever in Canada).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&amp;id=33 Canadian Football League], Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, at a rally at [[Toronto City Hall]], tens of thousands of people who were there to see the Toronto Argonauts began to chant, "We want a [[dome]]! We want a dome!" So too did others who began to discuss the possibility of an all-purpose, all-weather stadium.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=K1JsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT785&amp;lpg=PT785&amp;dq=toronto+rally+1982+we+want+a+dome&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cSclUIhV9G&amp;sig=ylhm16fm0XASRkHM6HU_mX6YsCo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig2Yi-kI3ZAhUI62MKHWMqDWAQ6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=toronto%20rally%201982%20we%20want%20a%20dome&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven months later, in June 1983, Premier Davis formally announced that a three-person committee would look into the feasibility of building a domed stadium at [[Exhibition Place]]. The committee consisted of [[Paul Godfrey]], [[Larry Grossman (politician)|Larry Grossman]] and former Ontario Hydro chairman Hugh Macaulay.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David (October 7, 1984). Battle Is On for Right to Build Our Domed Stadium. [[Toronto Star]]. pg A1, A13.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the city also studied a number of potential sites for the new domed stadium, and in April 1984, CN agreed to donate seven acres of land near the [[CN Tower]] for the stadium; groundbreaking began in October 1986, and the stadium, which would take on the name [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] (now Rogers Centre), opened in June 1989.&lt;ref&gt;https://torontoist.com/2009/06/historicist_the_road_to_skydome/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Life following the opening of SkyDome====
[[File:exhibition stadium.jpg|260px|thumb|The stadium exterior in 1992]]
Exhibition Stadium lay mostly dormant over the decade following the opening of SkyDome, except for the occasional concert or minor sporting event. The World Wrestling Federation (now [[WWE]]), needing a new venue after a decision to discontinue events at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in 1995, held one [[Card (sports)|card]] at the stadium on August 24, 1996 for a crowd of 21,211. The main event was [[Shawn Michaels]] vs. [[Goldust]] in a ladder match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=33040 "WWF House Show"], Cagematch. Retrieved 8 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was demolished in 1999 and the site is now the location of [[BMO Field]] and a parking lot. A few chairs from the stadium can be found on the southeast corner just north of the bridge to [[Ontario Place]]'s main entrance. As is common with stadium demolitions, a number of the remaining seats were sold to fans and collectors.

====The "Mistake by the Lake"====
Although not widely used while the stadium was in operation (given the well known references to Cleveland's [[Cleveland Stadium|Municipal Stadium]]), the term "Mistake by the Lake" has been used more recently in reflection by Toronto media to refer to the now-demolished venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woolsey|first1=Garth|title=Toronto's dome turns 20|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/baseball/2009/05/30/torontos_dome_turns_20.html|accessdate=August 5, 2009|publisher=Toronto Star|date=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New stadium==
{{Main article|BMO Field}}
On October 26, 2005, the [[Toronto|City of Toronto]] approved {{CAD|$69 million}} to build [[BMO Field]], a new 20,000 seat stadium, in almost the same spot where the old stadium once was. The governments of Canada and [[Ontario]] combined for {{CAD|35 million}}, with the city paying {{CAD|9.8 million}}, and [[Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment]] paying the rest, including any runoff costs. Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment got the naming rights of the new stadium, and has a [[Major League Soccer]] team in the new stadium, named [[Toronto FC]]. The stadium also held the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] along with other cities in Canada.

BMO Field was initially built as a [[soccer-specific stadium]] with field dimensions that were too small to accommodate a Canadian football field and was operated as such until 2015 when MLSE owners [[Larry Tanenbaum]] and [[Bell Canada]] agreed to purchase the Toronto Argonauts. As part of the agreement, BMO Field was renovated to allow the Argonauts to move back to the site in time for the [[2016 CFL season]]. The stadium also hosted the [[104th Grey Cup]] in 2016 and [[MLS Cup]]s in 2010, 2016, and 2017, along with the outdoor [[NHL Centennial Classic]] game within a 35-day period.

==Chevrolet Beach Volleyball Centre==

For the [[2015 Pan American Games]] and [[2015 Parapan American Games|Parapan American Games]], the old stadium footprint (parking lot) became the [[Chevrolet Beach Volleyball Centre]]. The temporary venue had bleachers and a playing area filled with 3,000 metric tonnes of sand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toronto2015.org/venue/beach-volleyball-centre&lt;/ref&gt; After the Pan American Games, the venue was torn down to allow for setup of rides and restore parking spaces for the 2015 [[Canadian National Exhibition]] opening on August 21 of the same year.

==Facts and figures==
*On July 18, 1958, [[Richard Petty]] made the first of 1,184 starts in [[NASCAR]] Grand National (now the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Monster Energy series]]) competition in a race at the grandstand, entitled the [[1958 Jim Mideon 500]].
*The stadium was featured on a Season 4 ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' episode titled "A Long Way from St. Louie" which first aired on December 6, 1963.

*1967 saw the [[Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo 1967]] perform 8 shows at the stadium to standing ovations every night.  So popular with crowds at the stadium of 30,000 most nights, the 89-year-old never on Sunday taboo had to be waived to permit the Tattoo to put on a Sunday September 3 performance to accommodate the extraordinary demand for tickets.  John Holden, a CNE official stated, "It was breathtaking.  You just can’t compare it with the like of anything that has come before it."  CNE General Manager Bert Powell stated, "We’ve never had anything like it — fabulous and fantastic.  My phone is never quiet. I’m even getting professional critics and entertainers begging for tickets, and that's the ultimate tribute."    
*[[Soccer Bowl '81]] was played at Exhibition Stadium.
*In 1982, the [[70th Grey Cup]] game held at the stadium had the largest number of television viewers in Canadian history, with 7,862,000. The record has since been broken.
*[[The Jacksons]] performed three concerts at the stadium on October 5, 6 and 7, 1984 during their [[Victory Tour (The Jacksons tour)|Victory Tour]] in front of 165,000 in attendance.
*In 1985, the first [[1985 American League Championship Series#Game 7|Game 7]] in the history of the [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] was played at the stadium. The Blue Jays lost to the [[Kansas City Royals]], 6–2.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
*In August 1986, the stadium played host to the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]'s "Big Event" card in front of over 70,000 fans. The main event was then-[[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Hulk Hogan]] against [[Paul Orndorff]].  This event did not air on pay-per-view. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} 
* [[Van Halen]] August 18, 1986 capacity concert sellout the first new tour with [[Sammy Hagar]] as lead singer
* [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] sold out the stadium on September 22, 1986 at 8:00 P.M. to a sold-out crowd of 61,000 people as a part of their North American leg of [[The Invisible Touch Tour]].
* [[U2]] played the stadium on the [[Joshua Tree Tour]] on October 3, 1987, and on the [[Zoo_TV_Tour|ZooTV Tour]] on September 5 and 6, 1992.
*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] brought her [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] to the stadium on July 4, 1987 before a sold out crowd of 50,013 people.

*[[Guns N' Roses]] played the stadium on back-to-back nights, June 7 and 8, 1991, as part of their [[Use Your Illusion Tour]].

'''Fair Park Coliseum''' was a 7,200-seat, covered, open-sided, multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]]. It hosted local sporting events and concerts.  It was opened in 1978.  At the time of its opening the Fair Park Coliseum was the primary concert venue in the Beaumont area; within a decade, however, demand for concert tickets proved so high that the much larger [[Montagne Center]] was built in 1984, only six years after the Coliseum had opened.  The Coliseum would then become the Beaumont home of the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus]], [[Disney on Ice]], and [[Champions on Ice]] until [[Ford Arena]] was built.  After significant damage to the coliseum from [[Hurricane Rita]] and acquisition of the surrounding property by the Beaumont Housing Authority, the coliseum was demolished.  The City of Beaumont awarded a contract for demolition on November 6, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jim Guidrey|title=Beaumont City Council|url=http://www.guidrynews.com/story.aspx?id=1000005416|publisher=GuidreyNews.com|accessdate=January 8, 2015|date=November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoersel's women's A squad won promotion to the [[Ere Divisie Dames|highest level]] of Belgian volleyball for the first time in 2006. The men's A squad currently participates in the EuroMillions Volley League since the season 2015-2016.

'''GoalControl''' is a German company&lt;ref&gt;http://goalcontrol.visualseven.de/en/imprint.html&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Würselen]], [[Aachen (district)|district of Aachen]] which has developed a [[goal-line technology]] for [[Association football]].

The Goal Control system features 14 high speed cameras which are mounted around the stadium, 7 directed to each of the goals. These cameras are used to detect if the ball has crossed the goal line or not. The camera is capable of taking 500 pictures per seconds and the ball's movement within {{convert|5|mm}}.&lt;ref name=DW&gt;{{cite web|title=Behind the Scenes with GoalControl|url=http://www.dw.de/behind-the-scenes-with-goalcontrol/av-17711403|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]|accessdate=14 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714183652/http://www.dw.de/behind-the-scenes-with-goalcontrol/av-17711403|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cnet/&gt; Camera data is sent to the central image processing center located within the stadium using [[fiber optics]] cable, where a virtual representation of the ball is output to confirm the goal.

A vote cast in early 2014 by the [[Deutsche Fußball Liga|36 German clubs of the first and second division]] decided with only 12 out of 36 votes for using the system due to the "exorbitant cost" of €250,000 (chip in the ball) to €500,000 (Hawk-Eye, GoalControl) per club.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28929">[[Image:Hunt seat.jpg|thumb|A horse and rider with hunt seat tack and attire]]
'''Hunt seat''' is a style of [[Jumping position|forward seat]] [[equestrianism|riding]] commonly found in North American [[horse show]]s.  Along with [[dressage]], it is one of the two classic forms of [[English riding]].  The hunt seat is based on the tradition of [[fox hunting]]. Hunt seat competition in [[North America]] includes both flat and over fences for [[show hunter]]s, which judge the horse's movement and form, and [[equitation]] classes, which judge the rider's ability both on the flat and over fences. The term ''hunt seat'' may also refer to ''any'' form of forward seat riding, including the kind seen in [[show jumping]] and [[eventing]].

Hunt seat is a popular form of riding in the United States, recognized by the [[USHJA]] (United States Hunter/Jumper Association) and the [[United States Equestrian Federation]], and in [[Canada]]. While hunt seat showing ''per se'' is not an [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] discipline, many show jumping competitors began by riding in hunter and equitation classes before moving into the jumper divisions.

==Rider position==
{{Main|Equitation|Jumping position}}
[[File:CollegiateEventer.jpg|thumb|One style of hunt seat saddle, an "eventing" saddle. It is heavier and has a deeper seat than the "close contact" style of hunt seat saddle.]]
The Hunt seat is also sometimes called the "forward seat."  Ideally, a hunt seat rider has a very secure position. This includes proper leg position, weight in heels, soft hands, good posture, balanced seat, eyes up and, when working over fences, looking ahead towards the next fence.

Riders usually employ a "two-point" position while jumping fences, depending on the type of course and height of fences.  The position is so named because the [[equestrianism|rider]] has "two points" (both legs) in contact with the [[saddle]]. The rider supports his or her body using leg and [[stirrup]], keeping the heels down, closing the hip angle, and lifting the buttocks out of the saddle while keeping the head and shoulders up.

On the flat, or when used on course between jumps, the two-point position allows the horse to have a great deal of freedom of movement because the rider's weight is lifted off its back.

Position in two-point varies according to the task. [[Show hunter|Hunter]] riders generally have a very upright two-point, as they usually show on very level footing and at slower speed. [[eventing|Eventers]] may have a more crouched position, usually with the heel slightly more forward while riding cross-country, to provide more security as they ride over varying terrain at a fast gallop.

==Types of competition==

Hunt seat competitions are generally divided into three [[horse show]] categories, hunters, equitation, and jumpers. [[Show hunter]]s as a group are judged on manners, way of going, and conformation. Turnout, the presentation of horse and rider, are often taken into account as well. [[Show jumping|Jumpers]] are judged by how quickly a horse can complete a course of jumps with the fewest errors, called ''faults.'' [[Equitation]] riders are judged on the way they look and form of the rider, and the smoothness and overall appearance of the horse and rider as a team.  Related disciplines within the broad category of "hunt seat" [[English riding]] include [[eventing]] and [[dressage]], though  the forward seat style of hunt seat equitation riders over fences contrasts with that of eventing riders in cross-country competition, or the deep, more upright position of dressage riders, a discipline that focuses on flat work does not incorporate jumping in competition.  These activities are all differentiated from [[saddle seat]]-style English riding, which is an American-based discipline confined to the flat, developed for high-action show horses that are not intended to be shown over fences.

==The horse==

===Show hunter===
{{Main|Show hunter}}
Horses used in hunter over fences and hunter under saddle (or "flat", non-jumping) classes are called [[show hunter]]s, and are judged on their movement, way of going, manners, and jumping form.  Conformation is judged to some extent as well.  Thus, smooth, quiet-moving, well-built horses with good temperament are desired.  A related flat class seen in many breed-specific competitions that is very similar to Hunter Under Saddle is [[English Pleasure]]-Hunter Type, called simply "English Pleasure" within some regions and breeds.  Although a somewhat different style of horse than the classic hunter may be shown, the goals of good manners, performance, quality and conformation are still emphasized.

Horses shown hunt seat may be of any breed, although those of [[Thoroughbred]] and [[Warmblood]] type are most common, except in [[pony]] classes.  Regardless of breed, the horse should have a long stride with very little knee action, good jumping form with correct [[bascule (horse)|bascule]], and should be well-mannered. For top level competition, movement and jumping form become increasingly more important.

===Show jumper===
{{Main|Show jumping}}
The show jumper is generally a horse that has more power and energy than a show hunter.  Because only jumping ability is scored, conformation, manners, and way of going are critical only as far as they affect soundness and ability to jump.  Jumpers are often taller and more powerfully built than hunters, often with a bit more speed.  Some are far more temperamental, though excellent jumpers must be manageable as well as athletic.  Horses may be of any breed, though again, Thoroughbreds and Warmbloods dominate the field.  It is rare for a horse to perform both as a hunter and as a jumper as temperament and style of movement are markedly different.

===Equitation===
{{Main|Equitation}}
[[File:4H Florida State 2014 SrEqOF.webm|thumb|Senior Equitation Over Fences at the 2014 Florida 4H State Horse Show]]
Hunt seat [[equitation]] classes judge the rider only, including his or her position on the flat and over fences and overall effectiveness while riding. Therefore, it is not imperative that the horse has perfect movement or jumping form, but it needs good manners and an attractive way of going that does not detract from the rider's performance.  Although temperament is not judged, horses with a more tractable temperament are generally easier to ride, and can therefore help riders demonstrate their skills.

The ideal equitation mount has less [[Bascule (horse)|bascule]] than the show hunter, because it is easier for a rider to maintain the correct jumping position on a "flatter" horse that does not throw the rider out of the saddle when it jumps.  However, a show jumper is not ideal either, as the horse may be less smooth in its way of going and too excitable in temper for the rider to maintain steady and correct form over a course. The horse must jump safely and not carelessly rub rails. The movement of the equitation horse is generally more collected than the show hunter, which allows the rider to better adjust the stride for tricky combinations.

==Differences between show hunters, show jumpers, and equitation==
{{Main|Show hunter|Show jumping|Equitation}}
[[File:Nick Skelton on Arko.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Jumper obstacles are generally very high and brightly colored.]]

===Courses===
The most notable difference between hunters and jumpers is the technicality of the courses. [[Show jumping]] courses include combination fences, sharp turns and several changes of direction, all requiring adjustability and athleticism. [[Show hunter]] courses include smoother lines, fewer combinations, and wider turns, reflecting the [[fox hunting]] tradition and the cadence needed for riding in large fields. Jumper fences can be quite high, up to 5'3" (1.60m) in Grand Prix show jumping, and well in excess of 7' (2.2m) in [[puissance]] (progressive high-jump) classes, with a much greater width. Show hunters, on the other hand, are shown over fences no greater than 4'6" in height (as displaced in the relatively new "Performance Working Hunter" classes), even at the highest levels, but are expected to display a cadence and elegance that is not necessary in show jumping.

Equitation over fences courses test a rider's skill and form. They look like a hunter course, but contain more technical elements, such as intermediate difficulty combinations, tight turns, and difficult distances between fences, which are often seen in show jumping. They often include combinations, tight turns, and difficult distances between fences. These courses reach 3'9" in height at the highest competitive level.

===Obstacles===
The fences used in show hunter courses are designed to be very natural in appearance, to simulate a natural cross-country hunting course. The poles and standards of the fences are usually natural wood or painted a conservative color, such as white or brown. Decorative elements might include brush or flowers. Water obstacles are not included.

Obstacles used in jumper competition are often brightly coloured and sometimes even deliberately designed to look "scary." These courses usually include an open water or [[water (obstacle)|"liverpool" obstacle]], and may also have varied terrain with fences on the top or bottom of a bank, or with a ditch under an obstacle.

Equitation obstacles, though more complex in layout than a hunter course, are usually more conservative in design than jumper obstacles, more closely following those of the hunter courses.

===Judging or scoring===
Equitation and show hunters are judged subjectively based on ability and form (of the rider) and elegance, cadence and style (of the horse). Equitation may be judged in one round, though often a "work-off" is included in which the top riders return for further testing that might consist of another round of jumping, flatwork, no stirrup work, or switching horses, for example. Hunter courses are generally judged in one round, but classics often include two rounds for the top competitors. In most horse shows, four over-fence rounds (one often containing a 25% conformation component) and one flat class make up each hunter section. The judge decides which combination has the smoothest round and displayed a ride most closely to the ideal. Certain mistakes like refusals will lead to drastic penalties, while minor errors like a soft rub on a rail are slightly penalized, at the judge's discretion. This can make judging difficult to follow for those new to showing until the subtle factors considered by the judge are better understood.

Unlike the subjective scoring of the hunters, show jumping horses are more objectively penalized by accumulating "faults" if they knock down or refuse obstacles (four faults), or if they exceed the optimum time. Some jumper classes also require a second round for those who jumped clean (received no penalties) in the first round. These "jump-offs" are judged on accuracy and time. Competitors are placed first in the order of fewest faults and then in the order of fastest time (not just time allowed).  Because style is never taken into account, the horse may jump in unorthodox form, take off from a poor spot, or rub a rail without any penalty. This objective scoring makes show jumping easy to follow though sometimes both horses and riders may exhibit unorthodox and even unsafe form without penalty.

===Pacing===
Speed is not favored in show hunter or equitation classes. A steady but forward canter is seen in show hunter courses and in equitation courses. In show jumping, the rider may be penalized for going over the time. Therefore, a faster but steady gallop is used in jumper classes. Jump-offs also often display greater pace as time is of the essence.

==Classes==
Classes of hunt seat riding are often divided by the horse and rider's ability, the rider's age, the height of the horse or pony, and the requirements of the horse in that class.

===Type of class===
*''Flat'' or ''Hunter Under Saddle'' classes: The horse is judged "on the flat," meaning jumping is not involved. In show hunter classes, the horse's movement and manners are judged, with quality of movement paramount. In equitation classes, the rider's position, seat, and aids are judged. Horses are shown at the walk, trot, and [[canter]]. In some classes, [[rein back|backing up]], an extended [[trot (horse gait)|trot]], and a [[horse gait|hand gallop]] may also be required.
*''[[English pleasure|Pleasure]]:'' Another class on the flat,  where the horse's manners and suitability for the rider are ranked more highly than quality of conformation and movement. The horse should look like it is a pleasure to ride.
*''Over-fences classes:'' The horse is judged over a course of fences. In show hunter classes, particular attention is paid to the horse's jumping form, the fluidity of the course, and its take-off spot for each fence on the course. The judge also looks for correct leads in the turns or clean [[flying change]]s, good movement, and a calm ride.
*''[[Equitation]] classes'' In hunt seat equitation classes, the rider is judged on the flat and over a course of fences, with attention focused on his or her position between and while over a jump, his or her ability to get a horse to the right take-off spot, choice of line between fences, and his or her overall effectiveness.  There are also equitation classes offered where riders are not asked to jump, particularly at lower-level shows.
*''[[Halter (horse show)|In-hand classes]],'' also called "model" classes,  these are non-riding classes where the horse is presented to the judge [[halter (horse show)|"in hand"]] meaning that it is led by a handler on the ground.  The horse wears only a bridle. The animal's [[equine conformation|conformation]] is judged, as well as its movement and soundness.

===Horse restricted divisions===
*''Pony Hunter:'' Pony hunter divisions are divided by the height of the pony. The divisions include small pony (12.2hh or smaller), medium pony (12.3hh to 13.2hh), and large pony (13.3hh to 14.2hh). The fence heights in pony classes are proportionate to the height of the pony. In regular competition, small ponies jump 2'3", medium ponies jump 2'6", and large ponies jump 3'".

Pony hunter divisions may also be specified as Green Pony Hunter divisions. Green Pony Hunter divisions are for those ponies who are in their first year of rated showing. In Green Pony Hunter classes, small ponies jump 2'3", medium ponies jump 2'6", and large ponies jump 2'9".

*''Green Hunter:'' Green hunter divisions are for horses that are beginning their showing careers. At the local level and at C-rated horse shows, Baby Green and Pre-Green Hunter divisions are often held. The heights depend on local rules. However, most Baby Green Hunter fences are set at 2'6" and most Pre-Green Hunter fences are set at 2'9"/3'.

First and Second Year Green Hunters are shown under [[United States Equestrian Federation|USEF]] rules. According to these rules, First Year Green Hunters are in their first year of showing fences at 3'6". Therefore, fences in their classes are set at 3'6". Second Year Green Hunters are in their second year of showing fences at 3'6". Fences in their classes are set at 3'9".

First and Second Year Green Hunters may also show in Green Conformation Hunter divisions. These divisions are the same as the previous divisions with one important difference. In conformation hunter classes, horses are judged 60% on their movement and performance and 40% on their conformation.

*''Regular Hunter:'' Regular Hunter divisions are for the experienced horse and rider combination. The horse is much more likely to be shown by a professional rider or trainer. Fences are 4' in height.

Regular Hunters may also show in Regular Conformation Hunter divisions. These divisions are the same as the previous division with one important difference. In conformation hunter classes, horses are judged 60% on their movement and performance and 40% on their conformation.

===Rider restricted classes===
*''Short stirrup, long stirrup, and green/novice rider:'' These classes are for the riders with less experience and or horses who can not jump quite as high. Short stirrup classes are usually for riders 12 and under, long stirrup classes are for those 13 and over, although age varies between shows. Fence heights in these divisions are usually 2'. Green or novice rider divisions have courses set at 2'3"–2'6".
*''Children, junior, and adult'' are classes broken down by age, but designed for riders with solid skills and a reasonable amount of show experience. Fences are usually 3' in the children's and adult amateur classes. Modified junior and Amateur classes are a step up, at 3'3". The highest levels for both age groups are the junior and amateur owner divisions, with fence heights of 3'6". These  classes may be further divided by height of horse into Large (16 hh+) and Small (under 16 hh), or by age of the rider.  USEF age divisions are  usually 13 and under, 14–17 yrs, and 18 and over.  Some organizations break down the adult division even further.  Variations include 18–39 years, or 18–35, 36–49 and a "silver" division for riders 50 and over)
*''Walk/trot''' is a flat class for beginner riders, requiring the rider only to execute the walk and trot. These classes are not always offered at the higher-rated shows.
*''Beginner rider:'' A non-USEF type of class offered in some areas, open to riders who have just begun showing. The rider may become ineligible for this class after one or two years of showing, or after winning a certain number of classes. These classes are not offered at the higher-rated shows.
*''Maiden, Novice'' and ''Limit:'' Classes limited to horses or riders who have not won one, three or six first place (blue) ribbons in a given division at any show or shows sanctioned by a given organization, such as the USEF.
*''Adult Amateur'' and ''Professional:'' these class divisions are designed to separate non-professional riders, called ''amateurs'' (because they do not earn a living from equestrian activities) from professional riders and trainers.

==Required tack==
[[Image:Hunterhorse.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Correct tack for hunter classes]]

===Hunter and equitation classes===
Hunter classes (both under-saddle and over fences) have requirements for classic, plain [[horse tack|tack]] that demonstrates that the hunter is easy to ride and attentive and responsive to its rider.

The saddle is usually a type of forward seat ([[English saddle|jumping saddle]]), generally the style called "close contact," though "eventing" and "all-purpose" designs are seen in some areas, particularly at lower levels.  Saddles are usually of brown leather, with a plain girth, usually of leather. The [[saddle blanket|saddle pad]] should be white, and shaped to fit the saddle. Ideally, no more than one inch of pad should appear under the saddle.

The [[bridle]] is simple, with a plain [[cavesson]] (any type of [[noseband]] other than a plain cavesson is prohibited) and a simple, unadorned browband.   [[Bit (horse)|Bits]] are also simple, with riders usually using a classic [[snaffle bit]], either a dee-ring, eggbutt, or full cheek design.  Milder bits are preferred in hunter classes. [[Pelham bit]]s which include a [[curb chain]] and require two sets of [[rein]]s are also legal and are particularly popular in [[equitation]].  [[Bit converter]]s are illegal.

Almost all shows prohibit martingales in "flat" or "under saddle" (not to jump) classes. [[Martingale (tack)|Martingales]] are only permitted in over-fence classes, and only the standing martingale is legal in [[show hunter|hunter]] classes.  A running martingale is legal for jumpers, but it is not for hunters.  According to the 2007 [[United States Equestrian Federation|USEF]] Rule Book for the Hunter division, "Martingales of any type are prohibited in Under Saddle, hack and tie-breaking classes. Standing martingales are allowed for all over fence classes. All other martingales may be considered unconventional."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usef.org/documents/ruleBook/2007/15-HU.pdf 2007 USEF Rule Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breed shows===
In some breed-specific  shows, other types of bits, such as the [[Kimberwicke]], are sometimes legal, but are not considered "classic" hunt seat bits, and riders moving from breed-specific to open competition are sometimes penalized severely if they use non-traditional equipment in open competition.

==Grooming and braiding==
{{See also|Horse grooming|Mane (horse)#Braiding(US)/Plaiting(UK)|Tail_(horse)#Grooming_and_styles}}
The horse must be very neat and well-presented.  Hunter and equitation horses are to have braided [[mane (horse)|manes]] and [[tail (horse)|tails]] while showing, particularly at rated competition. If braiding is not possible, the mane is to at least be pulled neatly and lie flat on one side of the horse's neck. The dock of the tail is braided into a "French" style braid, which runs the length of the tailbone, with the remainder of the tail allowed to flow freely.  In the United States, the hunt seat horse's tail is not "banged" (cut straight across to an even length), though banged tails are seen in Europe.&lt;ref name=GroomingToWin100&gt;Harris, Susan E. ''Grooming to Win'' New York: Scribner's 1977 {{ISBN|0-684-14859-5}} pp.&amp;nbsp;100–127&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses usually have any long body hair trimmed short, particularly around the fetlocks, jaw, and ears.  In some breeds and in some places, it is common to trim muzzle whiskers as well. Many exhibitors also trim a small [[bridle path (horse)|bridle path]] by shaving a few inches of mane right behind the ears. The horses are usually bathed the day before a show, blanketed overnight to stay clean, and thoroughly groomed the day of the competition prior to entering the ring.  Braiding of the mane and, when applicable, tail, is often done the night before or morning of the show, but can be completed earlier if precautions are taken to avoid having the horse rub out the braids.&lt;!--See the mane and tail articles for more discussion on this, and those articles are good place to expand--&gt;

==Rider attire==
[[Image:Hunt Seat Photo.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The show hunter and rider formally turned out for a major horse show. Horse is braided, rider wears a hunt coat, boots, breeches, and white ratcatcher shirt.]]
[[Image:Quarter Horse Hunter.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A hunter rider casually turned out for a small show or clinic, horse is not braided and rider is not wearing a jacket, but presentation remains neat and clean.]]
[[Image:shadbelly.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A hunter rider wearing the traditional shadbelly.]]

The hunt seat rider is dressed conservatively. Classic attire for hunter classes consists of beige, tan or gray breeches, a white or light pastel shirt, and a black, navy, gray, "hunter" green or dark brown hunt coat. (Black is considered a dressage style, however, and though legal, is less often seen in Hunter classes.)  Some years, patterns that appear solid at a distance, such as pinstripes, faint plaids or herringbone, are popular.  In some competitions, the show management may choose to waive the jacket requirement if the heat and humidity is very high.&lt;ref name=HorsesAndHorseman344&gt;Ensminger, M. E. ''Horses and Horsemanship: Animal Agriculture Series'' Sixth Edition Interstate Publishers 1990 {{ISBN|0-8134-2883-1}} pp. 344–345&lt;/ref&gt;

The show shirt, called a "ratcatcher," is a buttoned shirt with a stand-up [[Mandarin collar|mandarin-style collar]] covered by a separate, matching choker or a stock tie, the final look usually resembling that of a [[turtleneck]]. The traditional, classic shirt is white.  However, in some places and at some types of less formal competition, particularly for children, pastel-colored shirts are popular, coordinated with the colors in the hunt coat.   Traditionally shirts were long-sleeved, but today are more often short-sleeved or sleeveless, though sleeveless shirts cannot be worn when the jacket rule is waived.  Stock pins are sometimes worn on the stock tie or choker, although the most recent fashion has been to embroider the rider's initials on the choker.&lt;ref name=HorsesAndHorseman344/&gt;

A recent trend in Hunter Classics and stakes classes is for Hunter riders wear a different styled coat called a shadbelly. This is a black coat cut short on the front midsection but worn long with tails in the back. The shadbelly is worn with a stock tie and pin and with taddersall points on the bottom. This coat is not seen in most hunter classes or at smaller shows, and is almost never required.  This trend has been adopted from dressage competition where the shadbelly is worn in the upper levels.  However, traditional hunt riders still wear the shorter hunt coat.

In some places, particularly breed-specific shows where tradition is not as strong, different colors of jackets and shirts are seen: riders sometimes wear tan, teal, light grey, or even dark violet coats with shirts in more vivid shades like green, orange, pink, lavender, and blue. Non-traditional attire is frowned upon and sometimes penalized in open competition.

The rider is usually required to wear an [[ASTM]]/[[Safety Equipment Institute|SEI]]-approved [[equestrian helmet]] with safety harness fastened. Although black, velvet-covered hunt caps were once popular, the old style caps provided virtually no actual protection to the head and are now prohibited for junior riders at any time while mounted, and are not allowed on riders of any age in classes to jump. Caps are still sometimes seen on adult riders in flat classes, and remain somewhat popular at breed shows.  However, many adult hunt seat riders who do not jump are also leaving behind the hunt cap in favor of ASTM/SEI-approved headgear.

Some helmets retain the classic velveteen covered look.  Newer designs are characterized by a broader visor, a contrasting ventilation strip down the center, and, for women, a hair-catching cloth at the back.  The ventilation strip has given this style of helmet the tongue-in-cheek nickname "skunk helmet".  Helmets with vivid colors and designs are often worn by children, but usually covered with a black velvet cloth cover for show.

Riders 13 years or older generally wear tall, black field boots with breeches. Younger riders who still have rapidly growing feet may wear either brown or black [[jodhpur boot]]s (sometimes called "paddock boots") and "jod straps" (strips of leather worn buckled under each knee for grip) with [[jodhpurs|jodhpur pants]].&lt;ref name=HorsesAndHorseman344/&gt;

Dark gloves should be worn, but are not required.&lt;ref name=HorsesAndHorseman344/&gt;

Attire for jumper classes resembles that of hunter riders, though may be less formal at lower levels. It is becoming acceptable in some regions  and with some organizations for competitors to wear any collared shirt, such as a polo shirt, during very hot weather, rather than the traditional wool hunt coat and long-sleeved ratcatcher.&lt;!--California circuit does this a lot--&gt; For upper level competitions, such as classics and grand prixs, formal dress is usually required. This usually includes light-colored (usually shades of beige or a pale "canary" yellow) or white breeches, a white shirt, and a dark coat. Some riders are allowed to wear scarlet coats based on achievements in the sport.&lt;ref name=HorsesAndHorseman344/&gt; &lt;!--I think hunt colors can be worn in Hunter but not Jumper?  Check?--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13710">The '''icosathlon''', also called the '''double decathlon''', is an ultra multi-event of [[track and field]] competition consisting of 20 events contested over two days. There is an extra rule, that each day should contain a pause of one hour. Mostly the competition is held over two days, but one-day icosathlons also exist. The first day of the standard icosathlon includes:
* [[100 metres]]
* [[Long jump]]
* [[hurdles|200 metre hurdles]]
* [[Shot put]]
* [[5000 metres]]
* pause
* [[800 metres]]
* [[High jump]]
* [[400 metres]]
* [[Hammer throw]]
* [[3000 meter steeplechase]]

On the second day of the standard icosathlon, the following events are contested:
* [[110 metre hurdles]]
* [[Discus throw]]
* [[200 metres]]
* [[Pole vault]]
* [[3000 metres]]
* pause
* [[400 metre hurdles]]
* [[Javelin throw]]
* [[1500 metres]]
* [[Triple jump]]
* [[10000 m]]

Each event is scored according to the [[decathlon]] scoring tables or, for non-decathlon events, the [[IAAF]] points tables. At the conclusion of each icosathlon, the competitor with the highest point total is declared the winner.

The event is overseen by the [[International Association for Ultra Multievents]] (IAUM), which also holds the [[tetradecathlon]] based on the women's [[heptathlon]]. The men's world record for the standard icosathlon of 14,571 is held by [[Joseph Detmer]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://icosathlon.over-blog.com/pages/World_Records-1684221.html World Records - I A U M : International Association for Ultra Multievents]&lt;/ref&gt; The women's world record of 11,091 is held by Kelly Rodmell.

== Indoor equivalent ==
For indoor ultra-multievent meetings, all competitors compete in an indoor tetradecathlon, spanning 14 events over 2 days. These events are as follows:

'''Day 1'''
* [[60 metres|60m dash]]
* [[Long jump]]
* [[800 metres|800m]]
* [[Shot put]]
* [[400 metres|400m]]
* [[High jump]]
* [[3000 metres|3000m]]

'''Day 2'''
* [[60 metres hurdles|60m hurdles]]
* [[Pole vault]]
* [[1500 metres|1500m]]
* [[Weight throw]]
* [[200 metres|200m]]
* [[Triple jump]]
* [[5000 metres|5000m]]

Unlike in outdoor ultra multi event competitions, the number and order of events is the same for both genders.

'''Intrust Bank Arena''' is a 15,004-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Wichita, Kansas]], United States.  It is located on the northeast corner of Emporia and Waterman streets in downtown Wichita.

The arena features 22 suites, 2 party suites, and over 300 premium seats.  It is home to the [[Wichita Thunder]] of the [[ECHL]] and the [[Wichita Force]] of the [[Champions Indoor Football|CIF]].  It is the second largest indoor arena in the state of Kansas, behind [[Allen Fieldhouse]], which seats 16,300.

The [[Wichita State Shockers]] [[Wichita State Shockers men's basketball|men's basketball team]] uses the arena as an alternate site for games that attract more fans than can be accommodated at its on-campus arena, [[Charles Koch Arena]]. The arena hosted first and second round games for the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament]] in [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|2011]] and the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] in [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2018]]. The arena is also scheduled to host 1st and 2nd round games of the men's tournament in [[2021 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2021]] as well as a regional for Sweet 16 and Elite 8 games in [[2022 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|2022]].

== History ==
The facility was known as '''Sedgwick County Arena''' during early planning stages.  It was meant to replace the [[Kansas Coliseum]] north of Wichita.

On November 9, 2004, [[Sedgwick County, Kansas|Sedgwick County]] voters approved the downtown arena at a projected construction cost of $183,625,241&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Testimony Supporting an Arena Re-Vote|first=Bob|last=Weeks|url=http://wichitaliberty.org/sedgwick-county-government/testimony-supporting-an-arena-re-vote/|publisher=Voice For Liberty in Wichita|date=May 23, 2007|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a 52-48% margin.

On April 4, 2005, Governor [[Kathleen Sebelius]] signed the Intrust Bank Arena tax bill authorizing Sedgwick County to collect a 1% sales tax beginning July 1, 2005 for 30 months.

On January 10, 2008, Sedgwick County announced it had reached a 25-year, $8.75 million naming rights deal with Wichita-based Intrust Bank, the largest bank headquartered in Kansas. This complements a 20-year, $3 million deal with [[Cessna Aircraft Company]] to name an adjacent outdoor plaza, and a concourse area deal with [[Spirit AeroSystems]].

It was announced on March 9, 2010 that the Intrust Bank Arena was voted the 'Best Arena' and 'Best Locker Rooms' and also voted third in the 'Best Press Box' category in the [[Central Hockey League]]'s annual 'Best of the Best' poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arena, Fans Top 2010 Best of the Best Poll|url=http://www.wichitathunder.com/news/article944.html|publisher=Wichita Thunder|accessdate=March 12, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615180332/http://www.wichitathunder.com/news/article944.html|archivedate=June 15, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intrust Bank Arena cracked Pollstar's Top 50 Arena Venues for ticket sales during the first quarter of 2010. Intrust Bank Arena ranked 22nd in the United States and 45th worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intrust Bank Arena ranks in top 50 world ticket sales|url=http://www.intrustbankarena.com/news.asp?id=10&amp;pid=285&amp;task=display&amp;pcatid=|publisher=Intrust Bank Arena|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kezar Stadium''' is an outdoor athletics [[stadium]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], located adjacent to [[Kezar Pavilion]] in the southeastern corner of [[Golden Gate Park]]. It is the former home of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Oakland Raiders]] (first [[American Football League|AFL]] season only) of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and of the [[San Francisco Dragons]] of [[Major League Lacrosse]]. It currently serves as the home of [[San Francisco City FC]] of the [[Premier Development League]].

Kezar also hosts amateur and recreation sports leagues, as well as numerous San Francisco [[high school football]] games (including the city championship, known popularly as the "Turkey Bowl").

==History==
[[File:Kezar Stadium (3540115697).jpg|thumb|Original Kezar Stadium]]
In 1920, Jack Spaulding proposed an athletics stadium for San Francisco, seating 50,000.  Many business leaders in the city backed him, as it would keep San Francisco level with other cities with large stadiums.  Areas under consideration for the stadium were 7th &amp; Harrison Streets, Ocean Shore, and the Central Park grounds.&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Bulletin, October 13, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the San Francisco Park Commission accepted a $100,000 gift from the estate of Mary Kezar to build a memorial in honor of her mother and uncles, who were pioneers in the area. After the City and County of San Francisco appropriated an additional $200,000, the stadium was built in a year. Dedication ceremonies were on May 2, 1925, and featured a two-mile (3.2&amp;nbsp;km) footrace between [[Ville Ritola]] and [[Paavo Nurmi]] of Finland, two of the great runners of the era.  A little over a month later, the new stadium hosted the [[USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships]].

===1930s===
The stadium had many uses in the 1930s. In addition to track and field competitions, Kezar Stadium hosted [[Motorcycle sport|motorcycle racing]], [[auto racing]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[lacrosse]], soccer, &lt;!-- donkey??? --&gt;baseball, [[boxing]], [[cricket]], and [[American football|football]]. In September 1932, the [[Australian Cricket Team]] played a North California all-star team in the Australians' 56-game tour of the U.S. and Canada. The stadium was also home to several colleges ([[Santa Clara Broncos football|Santa Clara]], [[San Francisco Dons#Football|USF]], [[Saint Mary's Gaels football|St. Mary's]]), and the now-defunct [[San Francisco Polytechnic High School]]. In 1926, the stadium also became the home of the {{nowrap|[[East–West Shrine Game]].}}

===Football===
====High school====
[[File:View over Kezar stadium from Mt. Olympus in San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Kezar Stadium in 1955,&lt;br&gt;from [[Mount Olympus, San Francisco, California|Mt. Olympus]]]]
In 1928, the city [[High school football|high school]] championship game between cross-town rivals [[San Francisco Polytechnic High School|San Francisco Polytechnic]] and [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell]] drew more than 50,000—still the record for a high school football game in [[Northern California|northern]] California.  The [[Bruce-Mahoney Trophy|Bruce-Mahoney]] rivalry football game between [[St. Ignatius College Preparatory]] and [[Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory|Sacred Heart Cathedral Prep]] is held at the new (smaller) stadium.

====College====
The annual East-West Shrine Game of 1931 was replaced by a raucous Knights of Columbus game featuring the Savoldi All-Stars.  Prescott Sullivan, noted San Francisco Chronicle sportswriter, recounted the day's events in his January 26 column.  [[Joe Savoldi|"Jumping Joe" Savoldi]] gave some very sound reasons why [[Knute Rockne]] calls him "modern football's greatest fullback" yesterday when he led a team composed largely of California and U.S.C. stars to a 13-0 victory over [[Ernie Nevers]] and a supporting cast of St. Mary's players at Kezar Stadium.  More than 30,000 customers put the Knights of Columbus’ grid finales over in a big way and saw “Jumping Joe” and his playmates cinch their victory with two spectacular fourth period touchdowns.  These runs, end to end, constituted a very sizable day's work for "Jumping Joe," and the crowd showed it's deep appreciation by mobbing him at the finish of the ball game. Savoldi managed to escape by throwing his headgear to the milling throng, and long after the players had left the field of action, Joe's helmet was still at the center of a battle royal.  More than 200 enthusiastic souvenir hunters joined in the fight, which continued to rage unabated outside the stadium after police had managed to chase the combatants from the big bowl. Numerous black eyes were exchanged before mounted police finally quelled the uprising.  Such is Savoldi's fame!"

[[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]] played four of its home football games at Kezar; one in [[1928 Stanford football team|1928]] and three in [[1942 Stanford Indians football team|1942]]. Stanford was also part of the first-ever major college football double header in [[1940 Stanford Indians football team|1940]], which featured [[1940 Stanford Indians football team|Stanford]]–[[1940 San Francisco Dons football team|San Francisco]] and [[1940 Santa Clara Broncos football team|Santa Clara]]–[[1940 Utah Redskins football team|Utah]].&lt;ref name=ststat&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1092785/index.htm|magazine=Sports Illustrated|first=Ron|last=Fimrite|title=A melding of men all suited to a T|date=September 5, 1977|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Professional====
Kezar Stadium was the first home of the [[San Francisco 49ers]]&lt;ref name=tlkstkas&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CskTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D-EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5373,995141|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|agency=Associated Press|title=They're leaving Kezar to kids and seagulls|date=December 6, 1970|page=2B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oakland Raiders]], as well many NFL Hall of Famers, historical NFL games, and the first "[[Alley Oop (football)|alley-oop]]."&lt;ref name=wcbgkic&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/21/sports/football/colorful-history-of-kezar-stadium-49ers-former-home.html|newspaper=New York Times|last=Turbow|first=Jason|title=West Coast Brew Gave Kezar Stadium Its Color |date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Raiders played at Kezar for their first four home games in [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|1960]], and at [[Candlestick Park]] during the remainder of their first two seasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oakland Raiders 2010 Media Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; before [[Frank Youell Field]] was built as a temporary facility in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].  Defensive end [[Jim Marshall (American football)|Jim Marshall]] of the visiting [[1964 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] had his famous "[[Jim_Marshall (American football)#The Wrong Way Run|wrong way run]]" at Kezar in [[1964 San Francisco 49ers season|1964]], against the 49ers on October 25.&lt;ref name=vrrwa&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nmRYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l_cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5161%2C6395886 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Viking romps wrong way |date=October 26, 1964 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 49ers played the final NFL game at Kezar in early 1971, losing the [[1970–71 NFL playoffs|1970]] [[NFC Championship Game]] to the [[1970 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 17–10 on January 3.&lt;ref name=drebo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OpFYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZfgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6206%2C550376|work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Dallas rebounds |date=January 4, 1971 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 49ers moved to the more modern and accessible [[Candlestick Park]] {{nowrap|(1960–2015)}} for the [[1971 San Francisco 49ers season|1971]] season, and played there for {{nowrap|43 years,}} through [[2013 San Francisco 49ers season|2013]].

Kezar Stadium was also the home field for the San Francisco Stingrayz women's professional football team from {{nowrap|2003–2005,}} until the team was forced to end their season due to a bus accident which injured many players. The Stingrayz were one of the Bay Area's women's tackle football teams in the [[Women's Professional Football League]], and then the [[Independent Women's Football League]].

===1970s and 1980s===

====''Dirty Harry''====
Months after the 49ers' departure, several scenes from the [[1971 in film|1971]] film ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' were filmed at and above the stadium. The film's fictional antagonist, Scorpio (played by [[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]]), worked as the caretaker at the stadium and lived under the grandstand.&lt;ref name=wcbgkic/&gt;

====Concerts====
With the loss of professional football in 1971, the stadium became a popular outdoor concert venue, and its proximity to the [[Haight-Ashbury|Haight-Ashbury District]] helped with the transition. Notable performers at Kezar included [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[Jefferson Starship]], [[Tower of Power]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[The New Riders of the Purple Sage]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]] and [[Graham Central Station]].

====Gay Games====
The stadium hosted the inaugural and closing ceremonies of the 1982 and 1986 [[Gay Games]]. In the [[1982 Gay Games|1982 edition]] the stadium also hosted the soccer events.&lt;ref name=ebar1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/BAR_19820826#page/n43 |title=Official Schedule |work=Bay Area Reporter |date=26 August 1982 |accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ebar2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/BAR_19860807#page/n9 |title=Official Schedule |work=Bay Area Reporter |date=7 August 1986 |accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demolition and reconstruction===

[[File:Bob St. Clair's Kezar Stadium Plaque.jpg|thumb|200px|Plaque of NFL Hall of Famer&lt;br&gt;[[Bob St. Clair]] at Kezar Stadium]]
With pending demolition, the bleacher planks of Kezar Stadium were sold off to fans at a party in April 1989.&lt;ref name=fthpokz&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tWRjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qkYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5358,607226|newspaper=(Sonora, CA) Union-Democrat|agency=Associated Press|title=Fans take home pieces of Kezar|date=7 April 1989|page=3C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimesRazed&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-07/sports/sp-1370_1_kezar-stadium|title=Stadium to Be Razed : The Last Faithful Fans Take a Seat at Kezar|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=7 April 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June, the stadium was demolished and rebuilt with a much smaller [[seating capacity]] of 10,000. The upgrades included an eight-lane, all-weather track and a grass athletic infield suitable for soccer, football, and lacrosse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.ballparks.com/NFL/SanFrancisco49ers/oldindex.htm Kezar Stadium at Ballparks.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reconstruction, the field and track configurations were shifted several degrees counterclockwise, to move the stadium away from Frederick Street. The evidence for this can be seen by examining photos of the tunnel entrance at the east end of the field, which used to be exactly on the long axis of the track. A replica of the original concrete arch bearing the name "Kezar Stadium" was built on the west side of the stadium as a tribute to the original structure. A plaque of NFL [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Bob St. Clair]], a San Francisco native who played 11 pro seasons (1953–63) with the 49ers, plus his high school (S.F. Poly) and most of his college career (USF) at Kezar Stadium, is built into the replica arch.

===2014 to 2015 renovation===
Kezar Stadium was closed for renovations from September 29, 2014 until March 13, 2015. The $3.2-million renovation included the replacement of the running track surface, new entry walk paving, upgraded sound system, new perimeter walkways and curbs, installation of new Mondo running track surface and striping for nine 42” lanes. In addition, 1,000 historic Candlestick Park Stadium seats were installed for the public to enjoy. The renovation was funded by the City’s Capital Planning General Fund. Mayor Edwin M. Lee helped re-open the stadium with a warm-up run.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZoBxOZQGoE Mayor Lee at Kezar Track Opening After $3.2 Million Renovation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, 4,000 additional historic Candlestick seats were acquired and installed at Kezar. The seats were paid for by the [[San Francisco Deltas]] as a part of a $1-million improvement the team agreed upon to make use of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.sfgate.com/soccer/2016/12/02/candlestick-seats-will-soon-fill-sfs-kezar-stadium-thanks-to-san-francisco-deltas-soccer-team-49ers-nasl/ Candlestick Seats Will Soon Fill SF's Kezar Stadium]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soccer and other sports==
In 1967 it served as the home stadium for the [[San Francisco Golden Gate Gales]] of the [[United Soccer Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thesoccerobserver.com/2013/06/28/happels-monster-dutchmen-take-san-francisco-by-storm/|title=Happel’s “Monster” Dutchmen Take San Francisco By Storm|last=Thomson|first=Ian|date=June 28, 2013|work=The Soccer Observer|access-date=October 1, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 2006 West Coast expansion of [[Major League Lacrosse]], Kezar Stadium once again became a home to a professional team, the [[San Francisco Dragons]]. In October 2006, [[United Soccer Leagues]] (USL) and Spanish football club [[Deportivo Alavés]] announced that the new pro soccer team, named [[California Victory]], would play their 2007 home games at Kezar. The Victory played in the USL's First Division, one level below [[Major League Soccer]]. However, Alaves later withdrew their support and the team folded.

[[Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory]], a nearby Catholic high school uses the field for their home football games. [[Mission High School (San Francisco, California)|Mission High School]] also uses the field for home games. Kezar has also been the host of several Northern California Semi-pro football championship games.

In 2010, 2011, and 2012, [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]] held its spring football game at Kezar.  For the 2012 and 2016 San Francisco Olympic bids, Kezar was designated to host field hockey had San Francisco been chosen in either year.

From 2001 to 2016, Kezar was the home field for [[San Francisco City FC]], a supporter-owned club playing in the [[Premier Development League|PDL]].

In 2017, Kezar became the home field for the [[San Francisco Deltas]], a professional soccer team playing in the [[North American Soccer League]] (NASL). The Deltas have contributed over $1-million in renovations to the stadium. However, Deltas announced that they would be concluding operations and the team folded.

In February 2018, [[San Francisco City FC]] announced they would return to Kezar Stadium for the 2018 [[Premier Development League|PDL]] season.

===Women's soccer===
The [[San Francisco Nighthawks]], founded in 1995 and a member of the [[Women's Premier Soccer League]], play their home games at Kezar. The [[Bay Area Breeze]] of the [[USL W-League|W-League]] started play there in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breeze Tab Kezar Stadium as Home Field|publisher=United Soccer Leagues (USL)|date=2013-05-03|accessdate=2012-05-04|url=http://wleague.uslsoccer.com/home/716162.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528023703/http://wleague.uslsoccer.com/home/716162.html|archivedate=May 28, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College lacrosse===
Kezar is also the home to the annual San Francisco Fall Lacrosse Classic, an [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] fall ball game started in 2009 to benefit the Bay Area Youth Sports Foundation.  The first event was between [[Brown Bears men's lacrosse|Brown]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's lacrosse|North Carolina]]. It was the first Division I men's lacrosse played in Northern California.  North Carolina beat Brown 13–5 in front of a crowd of more than 4,500.  The 2010 event featured lacrosse powerhouse Johns Hopkins and Notre Dame on Saturday, October 16, 2010. Notre Dame beat Hopkins 10–7.  The third installment took place on Saturday, October 8, 2011 and featured the University of Denver and Harvard University.  The fourth installment took place Sunday October 21, 2012 in a match between [[Lehigh Mountain Hawks#Lacrosse|Lehigh]] and [[Ohio State Buckeyes|Ohio State]].&lt;ref name="sflacrosse"/&gt;  As a direct result of the San Francisco Fall Lacrosse Classic, the BAYS Foundation has made over $225,000 in grants to local youth sports and educations programs for under-resourced children throughout the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="sflacrosse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sflacrosse.com/|title=SFLacrosse.com: October 21, 2012 – Kezar Stadium, San Francisco CA – NCAA Division I Men&amp;#39;s Lacrosse Returns to San Francisco – Sunday, October 21, 2012|accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other sports===
In 2013, Kezar was home to the Major League [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]] ([[Major League Ultimate|MLU]]) team, the [[San Francisco Dogfish (MLU)|San Francisco Dogfish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6San Francisco Dogfish |work=Major League Ultimate |accessdate=1 February 2014 |date=14 January 2013 |url=http://sanfrancisco.dogfish.mlultimate.com/2013/01/14/dogfish-make-their-home-in-kezar-stadium/ |last=Phillips |first=John |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203111319/http://sanfrancisco.dogfish.mlultimate.com/2013/01/14/dogfish-make-their-home-in-kezar-stadium/ |archivedate=February  3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kezar was home to the San Francisco GAA football league ([[Gaelic football]]).
In 2004 it served as the home of the [[San Francisco Freedom]], the city's [[Pro Cricket]] team.

'''The William G. Mennen Sports Arena''', commonly called the '''Mennen Sports Arena''' or the '''Mennen Arena''', is a 2,500-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Morris Township, New Jersey]].  It hosts various local concerts and sporting events for the area. Mennen hosted one game for the [[New Jersey XTreme]] of the [[National Indoor Football League]] in 2005, and was formerly the home of the [[New Jersey Revolution]] of the [[American Indoor Football Association]]. [[Mennen]] also is the home of the County College of Morris hockey team as well as all of the public high school hockey teams in [[Morris County, New Jersey]].  Mennen is also one of the host arenas for the [[New Jersey]] Colonials, the main training center for the Skating Club of Morris, and the [[Precisely Right]] [[synchronized skating]] team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preciselyrightteams.com/ Precisely Right synchronized skating&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 2005, [[CM Punk]] won the [[Ring of Honor]] World Heavyweight Championship at the arena from [[Austin Aries]].

The Mennen Arena &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.morrisparks.net/aspparks/mennenmain.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315073229/http://www.morrisparks.net/aspparks/mennenmain.asp |archivedate=2007-03-15 |df= }} Mennen Arena&lt;/ref&gt; built in 1973 on land donated by the [[Mennen]] Company, now part of [[Colgate-Palmolive]].  It was opened to the public on January 12, 1975.  At that time, the facility consisted of one indoor multi-purpose arena with artificial ice in place for most of the year.

A second ice surface was added in an expansion building in 1986.  Due to continued growth in demand for ice time, a third surface was added in 2002, as well as additional space for parties and expanded restroom facilities.  

During the summer months the ice surface in the main rink is removed.  While the ice is out the arena hosts a wide variety of events ranging from indoor football to the [[Shrine Circus]].  Mennen has also hosted National Night Out as well as a Tiger Schulman's Mixed Martial arts event. Mennen arena has also hosted events such as other MMA events such as [[Grapplers Quest]] and [[Cage Fury Fighting Championships]] (CFFC)

Mennen Arena is a facility of The Morris County Park Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.morrisparks.net/index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719185026/http://www.morrisparks.net/index.asp |archivedate=2006-07-19 |df= }} Morris County Parks&lt;/ref&gt;

The field located outside of the arena is home to the Morris Lions Rugby Football Club.

'''Mondotrack''' is a trademarked synthetic track surface used for [[Track and field]] athletics. Mondotrack is developed by [[Mondo (Italian company)|Mondo]], a world leader in [[Track and field]] surfacing. Research was done to achieve the best possible surface for track events that will enhance performance and decrease the chance of injury. All Mondotracks come with a woven top layer and a hexagonal base layer. Unlike other tracks, Mondotracks can be different colors. Mondotracks are very prominent around the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/10/24/881960/0/en/University-of-South-Carolina-installs-Mondo-Super-X-720-track-fulfilling-coach-s-dream-of-having-Mondo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1980, [[Mondo (Italian company)|Mondo]], with the help of several biomechanical research laboratories from around the world, began researching new material for an athletic track surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-18735617|title=London 2012: Inside track on Olympic running surface|first=Alejandra|last=Martins|date=23 July 2012|publisher=|via=[[bbc.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mondo (Italian company)|Mondo]]'s goal was to improve "athletic performance, comfort and safety".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2016/06/11/world-class-track-built-downtown-for-street-meet/MpXRbun1G4yMTCiCLPYbYO/story.html|title=World-class track to be built downtown for street meet - The Boston Globe|publisher=[[bostonglobe.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of their research was the innovative Mondotrack. Since then, Mondotrack has become a staple synthetic track surface used all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/10/24/881960/0/en/University-of-South-Carolina-installs-Mondo-Super-X-720-track-fulfilling-coach-s-dream-of-having-Mondo.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many colleges in the United States and professional [[Track and field]] venues like the one used in the [[2011 IAAF World Championships]] have had Mondotrack as their surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondotrackusa.com/Super_X_Performance.cfm?id_applicazione=109&amp;id_tipologia_prodotto=2&amp;id_classe=1&amp;outdoor=1#2|title=MONDO - Super X Performance|website=www.mondotrackusa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mondotrack's superior design has led to many world competitions to use the type of track. Recent uses have been the [[2016 Olympic Games]] and the [[2012 Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/08/25/763152/10147028/en/New-Mondotrack-WS-track-surface-to-serve-as-competition-surface-of-2016-Rio-Olympic-Games.html|title=Globenewswire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 260 world records have been set on a Mondotrack.&lt;ref&gt;https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/08/15/864268/0/en/Two-world-records-set-on-Mondotrack-WS-at-Rio-Olympic-Games.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surface ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mondotrack - Blue.jpg|thumb|right|Surface of a blue colored Mondotrack]] --&gt;
Mondotrack comes in several variations: Mondotrack WS (Championship series), Super X Performance, and Super X 720.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coachmag.co.uk/fitness-technology/5640/incredible-olympic-tech|title=Incredible Olympic Tech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface is a seamless structure that is created through a vulcanized process. Two distinct layers make up the track: The top layer being a rubber-based soft surface and the bottom layer being a hard elongated hexagonal surface. The thickness is 13.5&amp;nbsp;mm and is available in eight different colors. Mondotrack comes in rolls no longer than 15 meters in length that are then assembled to make the complete track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/fivering_circus/2004/08/track_marks.html|title=Track Marks|first=Nick|last=Schulz|date=29 August 2004|publisher=[[slate.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spikes ==
Because of the design of the Mondotrack surface, certain spikes for running shoes are required. Compression (Christmas tree) spikes and 6mm (1/4in) pyramid spikes are promoted for use on Mondotracks. These spikes will not damage the track. Needle spikes however, will damage the track. The thin-sharp pointed needle spikes allow the spike to penetrate the surface which can rupture and degrade the track over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://athleticmanagement.com/content/spike-recommendations-mondo|title=Spike Recommendations From Mondo - athleticmanagement.com|website=athleticmanagement.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1609">The '''Monster Bat Incident 1771''' concerns an attempt to use a [[cricket bat|bat]] that was as wide as the [[wicket]], during a cricket match between [[Chertsey Cricket Club|Chertsey]] and [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]] at [[Laleham Burway]] that lasted from 23 September to 24 September 1771. Controversy arose when Chertsey's [[Thomas White (cricketer, born c. 1740)|Thomas White]] attempted to use the bat, while the Hambledon players objected. Ultimately Hambledon won the match by one run.&lt;ref&gt;''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket'' by [[G B Buckley]]&lt;/ref&gt; The incident is occasionally ascribed to [[Shock White|"Shock" White]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/wcm/content/story/235391.html Grim prophecy fulfilled: Wisden, March 1981]&lt;/ref&gt; a contemporary of Thomas White, but they were different players.

Afterwards, a formal protest was written by [[Thomas Brett (cricketer)|Thomas Brett]] and signed by himself, [[Richard Nyren]] and [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]]. The incident brought about a change in the [[Laws of cricket]], as confirmed in 1774, whereby the maximum width of the bat was set at four and one quarter inches. This ruling has remained intact.

'''''No No: A Dockumentary''''' is a 2014 American [[documentary film]] directed and produced by Jeff Radice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Sundance Docs in Focus: No No: A Dockumentary|url=http://whatnottodoc.com/2013/12/31/2014-sundance-docs-in-focus-no-no-a-dockumentary/|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered in competition category of ''U.S. Documentary Competition program'' at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 20, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sundance 2014: U.S. Documentary Competition|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-2014-us-documentary-competition|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sundance 2014: What happened ''After'' Dock Ellis pitched a no-hitter on LSD? -- EXCLUSIVE POSTER|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/01/15/sundance-2014-dock-ellis/|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film details the life story of American professional baseball player [[Dock Ellis]], his prolific career, his addictions to alcohol and amphetamines, his efforts to help other addicts until his death in 2008, and the no-hitter he threw while under the influence of LSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trailer: Sundance-Bound 'No No: A Dockumentary' (On Misunderstood Career Of Pirates Great Dock Ellis)|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/trailer-sundance-bound-no-no-a-dockumentary-on-misunderstood-career-of-pirates-great-dock-ellis|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘No No,’ a Documentary on MLB Pitcher Dock Ellis, Who Pitched a No-Hitter While Tripping on Acid|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/05/no-no-a-documentary-on-mlb-pitcher-dock-ellis-who-pitched-a-no-hitter-while-tripping-on-acid.html|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film received overwhelmingly positive response from critics. Duane Byrge of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film positive review and said that "More than just a documentary focusing on one man’s life, ''No No: A Dockumentary'' is not told just between the foul lines. It rounds several story bases: It flexes as a window on the cataclysmic changes of the late 1960s and ’70s, and documents Ellis’ substance abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No No: A Dockumentary: Sundance Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/no-no-a-dockumentary-sundance-673832|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Greene from [[Indiewire]] in his review said that "''No No: A Dockumentary'' becomes a supremely successful biography in acknowledging the reason for Ellis’ fame while showing how that story is just a sliver of what defined his later years" and that "''No-No'' exists as both a measured and vibrant portrait in equal measure, a fitting tribute to a life that encompassed both of those same qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sundance Review: 'No No: A Dockumentary' is Far More Than Simply a Look at the Day When Baseball and LSD Mixed|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-review-no-no-a-dockumentary-is-far-more-than-simply-a-look-at-the-day-when-baseball-and-lsd-mixed|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amber Wilkinson of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave the film four out of five stars and praised the director Jeff Radice by saying that "Radice takes an inventive approach to Ellis's story, using a terrific Seventies soundtrack, animation and manipulated still photography – frequently featuring trippy pops of colour – to maintain the momentum. He also approaches the tale with a sense of humour, even though he never plays down the havoc the pitcher's addictions wreaked on his personal life. An effortless home run."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sundance 2014, No No: A Dockumentary, review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10589675/Sundance-2014-No-No-A-Dockumentary-review.html|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drew Taylor, in his review for ''The Playlist'', praised the film that "''No No'' is a jazzy, joyful exploration of a man that, if he wasn't able to actually change the system, was at least happy with giving it the middle finger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sundance Review: Dock Ellis Baseball Doc 'No No' A Delightful Trip Around The Bases|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/sundance-review-baseball-doc-no-no-about-pitcher-dock-ellis-is-a-jazzy-delight-20140126|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''Oregon Sports Hall of Fame''' honors [[Oregon]] athletes, teams, coaches, and others who have made a significant contribution to sports in Oregon. The first class was inducted in 1980, with new inductees added in the fall. Operated by the Oregon Sports Trust, the museum is currently closed in preparation for moving to another facility.

==History and organization==
The Oregon Sports [[Hall of Fame]] inducted its first class of 54 members in 1980, a diverse group that included Olympians [[Mack Robinson (athlete)|Mack Robinson]], [[Don Schollander]] and [[Frank Troeh]], Boston Red Sox legend [[Johnny Pesky]], [[NFL]] hero [[Norm van Brocklin]], [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Terry Baker]], high jump innovator [[Dick Fosbury]], and basketball coaching legend [[Slats Gill]].

New members are inducted each fall, in a ceremony held in recent years at the [[Multnomah Athletic Club]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].

==Scholarships==
As part of its educational mission to promote the values and rewards of participation in sports, the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame grants as many as nine $2,000 scholarships given to outstanding Oregon student athletes who will be attending Oregon colleges. Scholarship winners are honored during the Hall of Fame induction ceremony.

==Facility==
From 1986 to 1997, the museum was located in a {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} basement under the [[Standard Insurance Center]] in downtown [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=pbj&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/1997/05/19/daily11.html|title=Sports Hall of Fame finds a new home|date=1997-05-22|accessdate=2008-05-27|work=[[Portland Business Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the museum moved to a nearby facility featuring {{convert|7000|sqft|m2|-2}} of space with hands-on exhibits, videos, and memorabilia, such as [[Terry Baker]]'s [[Heisman trophy]] (the first Heisman given to a West Coast athlete), [[Mack Robinson (athlete)|Mack Robinson]]'s Olympic jersey, one of [[Dale Murphy]]'s [[Golden Gloves]], and [[Bill Walton]]'s jersey from the 1977 [[Portland Trail Blazers]] [[NBA]] championship game.

In mid-2008, StanCorp evicted the museum in order to expand their own office space. The museum is closed in preparation for moving to an as-yet determined location.&lt;ref name=oshofrelo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonsportshall.com/index.htm |title=Museum closes temporarily |publisher=Oregon Sports Hall of Fame |accessdate=2008-05-27 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233740/http://www.oregonsportshall.com/index.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brandon&gt;{{cite news|last=Brandon|first=Steve|accessdate=2008-05-27|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|date=2008-04-22|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/sports/story.php?story_id=120881302336971000|title=Museum hunts for new home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pershing Center''' (originally known as '''Pershing Auditorium''') is a 4,526-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]. Although still physically in place, it is no longer in use.

==History==
In February 12, 1900, Lincoln's first municipal auditorium, though owned by [[Lancaster County, Nebraska|Lancaster County]] and operated by the local chapter of the [[American Legion]], opened. The building was burnt to the ground in an accident on April 15, 1928.&lt;ref&gt;http://journalstar.com/entertainment/misc/jim-mckee-what-will-become-of-pershing---/article_0b137316-de34-11df-8d2f-001cc4c002e0.html&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1931, the city of Lincoln was planning to build a new auditorium and name it after General [[John J. Pershing]], based on votes from students that would ultimately form and attend [[Lincoln Northeast High School]]. In 1939, city of Lincoln voters approved a $750,000 bond to build a new auditorium. A second bond in 1950, at cost of $1.5 million, was approved, but an additional $75,000 bond was rejected in 1952. Plans for Pershing were approved in 1955 and the building opened two years later.&lt;ref&gt;http://journalstar.com/entertainment/misc/jim-mckee-what-will-become-of-pershing---/article_0b137316-de34-11df-8d2f-001cc4c002e0.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mural===
Pershing's exterior is highlighted by a large [[ceramic tile]] [[mural]], designed by artists [[Leonard Thiessen]] and [[Bill J. Hammon]]. Measuring 38-by-140 foot (5320 sq. ft.; 494.2 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and consisting of 763,000 1-sq.-inch pieces, it was the largest ceramic tile mural in the United States at the time of its construction.&lt;ref&gt;http://journalstar.com/news/local/what-is-saving-the-pershing-center-mural-worth-to-you/article_0d0af8b6-e5ad-5b02-9b94-02e84d7cceed.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
The arena was home to the [[Lincoln Capitols]] [[National Indoor Football League|NIFL]] [[indoor American football|indoor football]] team [[Lincoln Thunder]] [[American Basketball Association (2000-)|ABA]] [[basketball]] team and the [[No Coast Derby Girls]] [[Women's Flat Track Derby Association]] league.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Swartzlander, "[http://journalstar.com/news/local/article_e13b897d-072c-50de-a67d-6229d00bfb64.html Roller Derby expo packs Pershing Center]", ''[[Lincoln Journal Star]]'', 25 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, it was home to the [[Lincoln Haymakers]] of the [[Champions Professional Indoor Football League]].

Pershing was also a host site for the NSAA boys and girls state basketball, as well as the NSAA girls volleyball championships. It has hosted the national roller-skating championships 28 times, beginning in 1962 though the final 2014 meet, called Last Lap At Pershing.&lt;ref name="Journal Star 2"&gt;[http://journalstar.com/special-section/new-directions/roller-skating-championship-will-need-new-home-in-lincoln/article_1563ae1b-759c-5c3c-95fe-aab30a6ea35a.html - Journal Star]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Concerts and other events==
Pershing has held many events in the past, including concerts and [[WWE]]/[[Impact Wrestling|TNA]] house show wrestling events. [[The Doors]] played their first concert since the death of their singer [[Jim Morrison]] at Pershing on November 12, 1971. The [[Grateful Dead]]'s performance, on February 26, 1973, was recorded and makes up half of their live album, entitled ''[[Dick's Picks Volume 28]]''. The exterior and marquee of the arena are also featured in the 1981 film, ''[[This is Elvis]]'', as it hosted one of [[Elvis Presley]]'s final concerts in 1977. [[Phish]] played the arena in 1995.

==Replacement==
In 2008-2009, discussions began to build a new, larger arena for Lincoln due to mid-sized arenas no longer able to meet the demands of most tours. According to Pershing General Manager Tom Lorenz "the music and entertainment industry has pulled back on midlevel tours, reducing the number of shows likely to come to Pershing. Normally, Pershing has six to eight concerts annually, but this year will have three or four".&lt;ref name="Journal Star 3"&gt;[http://www.journalstar.com/news/local/article_d87d4b92-4ffb-54db-b258-3848563ff376.html - Journal Star]&lt;/ref&gt; A subsidy to cover a budget shortfall of $150,000 was passed by the Lincoln City Council because the situation was so dire, only "10 months into the fiscal year." &lt;ref name="Journal Star 2"/&gt; The larger arena in Lincoln's [[Haymarket District (Lincoln, Nebraska)|Haymarket District]] was ultimately built between 2011 and 2013, opening as [[Pinnacle Bank Arena]] opened in August 2013.

The final major event, a concert by [[Goo Goo Dolls]], was held at the Pershing Center August 6, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omaha.com/go/concert-review-hit-makers-goo-goo-dolls-close-out-years/article_c257cbf3-994c-5f3b-bf21-432630c512de.html&lt;/ref&gt; The last usage of the building was a [[roller derby]] match August 23, 2014 between the [[No Coast Derby Girls]] and the [[Kansas City Roller Warriors]],&lt;ref&gt;http://nocoastderbygirls.com/?p=3891&lt;/ref&gt; it was won by the Kansas City Roller Warriors. 

===Future===
An [[Request for proposal|RFP]] was sent out by the City of Lincoln in 2014 looking for reuse plans for the Pershing Center, but none of the proposals were acceptable due to cost. Demolition may be in the building's future if an alternate use is not found.&lt;ref name="Washington Times 2"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/20/lincoln-may-demolish-downtown-pershing-center/?page=all - Washington Times]&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of the Pershing Center were auctioned off in January-February 2015. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.omaha.com/news/nebraska/lincoln-s-pershing-center-equipment-to-be-auctioned-off/article_8bc1859c-9493-11e4-b3ed-e71feb14a1a8.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Members of the community have also voiced their desire to save the large, iconic mural on the auditorium's exterior. Estimates place preservation and re-installation of the mural elsewhere at $1.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://journalstar.com/news/local/what-is-saving-the-pershing-center-mural-worth-to-you/article_0d0af8b6-e5ad-5b02-9b94-02e84d7cceed.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the auditorium's future is unclear. It remains standing, and is used only as a storage facility for the Pinnacle Bank Arena.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1011now.com/content/news/The-Pershing-Centers-future-raises-questions-about-necessity-affordability-379889491.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many proposals have been floated by private groups and government agencies, but none that the city government (who does not plan to demolish the building) has found acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;http://journalstar.com/special-section/new-directions/city-hall-shuttered-pershing-center-on-prime-real-estate-but/article_1c87e71b-af74-501d-9553-e803d069b265.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Stephen's Day bandy''' ({{lang-sv|Annandagsbandy}}) is a Swedish tradition in which elite [[bandy]] matches are played on [[Saint Stephen's Day]].&lt;ref name="annandagsbandy"&gt;{{cite news |first= Berndt |last= Rosqvist |title= Festligt och fullsatt på stora bandydagen |url=http://www.dn.se/sport/festligt-och-fullsatt-pa-stora-bandydagen |work=Dagens Nyheter |date=22 December 2003 |accessdate=2010-02-04 |language=Swedish |trans-title=Festive and packed with great bandy day}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The tradition dates to the 1930s, when the two clubs [[IF Göta]] and [[Slottsbrons IF]] took to playing a Saint Stephen's Day [[Exhibition game|friendly match]]. Despite initial objections by the [[Church of Sweden]] to scheduling the game on the Saint Stephen's Day, the event grew in popularity thereafter.

Historically, only a few instances of the Saint Stephen's Day match marked the season opener for [[Elitserien (bandy)|Elitserien]], Sweden’s top division. Prior to 1957, Saint Stephen's Day was the date of the final friendly match, after which the season usually started on New Year's Day. In 1957, the top division in Sweden resumed in December, and the Saint Stephen's Day marked the first day of seasons between 1957 and 1961, (the 1962 season began on December 31). From 1963–64 onwards the season began earlier in December, and since the 1966–67 season games have started in November.

There have been efforts, most notably in 1994, to revive [[New Year's Day|New Year's]] bandy and was itself a major event. However, the New Year's game has not been played in the top-tier of the league since the 1981–82 season.

Still by 1999, Saint Stephen's Day bandy was the only major sports event over Christmas in Sweden. Starting in the year 2000, it its popularity led other sports to follow, such as [[handball]] and [[ice hockey]]. Nowadays, people sometimes instead talk of "Saint Stephen's Day sports" ({{lang-sv|Annandagsidrott}}).

A '''silver medal''' in sports and other similar areas involving competition is a [[medal]] made of, or [[silver plating|plated with]], [[silver]] awarded to the second-place finisher, or [[runner-up]], of contests or competitions such as the [[Olympic Games]], [[Commonwealth Games]], etc. The outright winner receives a [[gold medal]] and the third place a [[bronze medal]]. More generally, silver is traditionally a metal sometimes used for all types of high-quality medals, including artistic ones.

Some governments award military and civilian decorations called Silver Medals. Silver medals can also be awarded by private organizations for achievements in their fields.

== Sports ==
=== Olympic Games ===
{{main|Olympic medal}}
In [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], winners' medals were in fact [[silver]]. The custom of [[gold]]-silver-[[bronze]] for the first three places dates from the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 games]] and has been copied for many other sporting events. [[Mint (coin)|Minting]] the medals is the responsibility of the host city. From [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]]–[[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by [[Florence|Florentine]] artist [[Giuseppe Cassioli]] with text giving the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of an Olympic champion. From [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]–[[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], Cassioli's design (or a slight reworking) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli's design showed a [[Roman amphitheatre]] for what was originally a Greek games, a new obverse design was commissioned for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens 2004]] Games. [[Winter Olympics]] medals have been of more varied design.

=== The Open Championship ===
In [[The Open Championship]] golf tournament, the Silver Medal is an award presented to the lowest scoring [[amateurism|amateur]] player at the tournament.

=== Psychological ===
Silver medalists were known to suffer "self-recrimination and gold medal envy", particularly those who had lost championship games or missed out of the title by a close score, whereas bronze medalists were usually happy just to make the podium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/fivering_circus/2014/02 silver_medal_face_the_saddest_looking_second_place_finishers_in_olympic.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In many sports with an elimination tournament, including those with a [[third place playoff]] (such as Olympic ice hockey, Olympic soccer, [[FIFA World Cup]]), silver is the only medal given to a team that loses, whereas gold and bronze are earned by teams winning their final matches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2018/2/22/17039802 jocelyne-larocque-removed-silver-medal-hockey-usa]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable athletes such as [[Lothar Matthäus]] ([[1999 UEFA Champions League Final]]) and [[Jocelyne Larocque]] (2018 Olympics) removed their runners-up/silver medals right after receiving them; Larocque was later ordered by the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] official to put her silver medal back on.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/olympics/rules-trump-emotion-as-canadian-womens-hockey-player-ordered-to-wear-silver-medal/article38062105/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/5170424 canadian-takes-off-medal-olympics/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2018/2/22/17039802 jocelyne-larocque-removed-silver-medal-hockey-usa]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some notable exceptions; for instance [[Elizabeth Manley]] (1988) and [[Paul Wylie]] (1992) were pleased to win silver medals in their respective Olympic figure skating disciplines after not expected to be podium contenders entering the competition.

== Military and government ==

Some countries present military and civilian decorations known as Silver Medals. These include:

*[[Austria]]′s [[Silver Medal for Services to the Republic of Austria]]
*[[Italy]]′s [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]]
*[[South Africa]]′s [[Silver Medal for Merit]]
*The [[Civil Air Patrol]]′s [[Silver Medal of Valor]] in the [[United States]].

== Other awards ==

The [[Zoological Society of London]] awards a [[Silver Medal (Zoological Society of London)|Silver Medal]] "to a Fellow of the Society or any other person for contributions to the understanding and appreciation of zoology, including such activities as public education in natural history, and wildlife conservation."

The [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] awards a Silver Medal "for an outstanding and demonstrated personal contribution to UK engineering, which results in successful market exploitation, by an engineer with less than 22 years in full-time employment or equivalent."

In [[martial arts]], '''stances''' are the distribution, foot orientation and [[body positions]] (particularly the legs and torso) adopted when attacking, defending, advancing or retreating.
In many [[Asian martial arts]], the most widely used stance is a [[Partial squat|shallow standing squat]]. This position is generally employed as it is a neutral and agile position from which both attacks and defences may be launched. It provides for the delivery of force when attacking and stability when defending.

Stances vary greatly in their application and form. In general, stances may be described in a number of ways:&lt;ref name="bellaonline.com"&gt;[http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art27738.asp A Proper Martial Arts Stance - Martial Arts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open or closed==
This refers to the lateral distance between the lead and rear foot. In general, open stances are more stable than closed stances. However, open stances leave one vulnerable to groin attacks and expose a larger portion of the body to an opponent.

==Long or short==
This refers to the distance from the lead foot to the rear foot. Short stances make the user very agile, but can be unstable.  Long stances are very stable, but this is at the expense of agility. Most stances are approximately as wide as the shoulders, though there is significant variation between styles.

==High or low==
This refers to the bend in the knees and height relative to a normal standing position.  Low stances are very powerful and assist delivery of power through the body to either the arms or the legs. High stances are more mobile and allow one to reposition rapidly.

==Weighted or unweighted==
Unweighted stances are those where half of one's bodyweight is on each foot.  Forward-weighted or backward-weighted stances place most of body weight on either the rear or the lead foot, respectively. Forward-weighted stances are more aggressive, allowing stronger punches and kicks because one's weight is already forward. Alternatively, backward-weighted stances are more defensive, allowing one to fall back more easily.

Most disciplines have one major stance that they regularly employ (generally from a standard guard position), and many variations of this standard stance which incorporate various combinations of open/closed, long/short, high/low or weighted/unweighted.&lt;ref name="Four basic Karate stances"&gt;[http://ndnd.essortment.com/karatestances_rucv.htm Four basic Karate stances&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, martial arts do not teach fighting stances until students have developed other basic skills.&lt;ref name="Four basic Karate stances"/&gt;

==Basic fighting stances==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|'''English boxing, Thai boxing''' 
* 2 feet aligned, somewhat spaced apart
* standing position
|-

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|'''Karate, Wushu, Silat''' 
* right foot in front, left foot facing left -OR-
left foot in front, right foot facing right

|-

== Conceptualising stances and footwork in the martial arts ==
It is very common in the martial arts to describe stances and the transitions between them in terms of triangles, squares and circles.&lt;ref name="practical-martial-arts.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.practical-martial-arts.co.uk/practical_jujitsu/db_stances_triangles.html Stances and Triangles - Practical Martial Arts Copyright 2007 - Keep it Real, Keep it Practical&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is often done in conjunction with attempts to gain [[positional advantage]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wingchun-kungfu.org/positioning_n.htm Positional Advantage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003236/http://www.wingchun-kungfu.org/positioning_n.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or gain control of the balance of an opponent.&lt;ref name="practical-martial-arts.co.uk"/&gt; In addition, in many styles, specific stances are adopted either for attack or for defence. In addition, many stances are used purely for training, or as progressions to more advanced and practical stances learnt later on.&lt;ref name="bellaonline.com"/&gt;

"Stances are the position from which all attacking and defensive moves begin. They combine balance, defence and readiness. A good basic stance is essential".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackpoolkarate.com/kickboxingskills.htm Karate and Kickboxing Skills, Kickboxing in Blackpool, Karate Stances, Wing Chun Pictures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Thuuz website was launched September 2010 to help sports fans solve the problem of [[information overload]] by identifying the best content "...like your buddy who calls and tells you there’s a great game going on," according to Thuuz CEO Warren Packard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/article/931173--feschuk-website-helps-fans-get-in-the-good-game Website Helps Fans Get in the (Good) Game], ''The Toronto Star'', 31 January 2011. Retrieved: 11 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2011, Thuuz released mobile applications for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/gamereport/sports_website_thuuz_rolls_out_its_dfv4Mn2LgBCUa9kN8UiplO Sports Website Thuuz Rolls Out New Mobile App], ''New York Post'', 15 September 2011. Retrieved: 15 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the 2012 NFL season, Thuuz upgraded its apps to support fantasy sports, alerting fantasy team owners to news, plays and scoring involving their players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maclife.com/article/news/thuuz_sports_update_brings_fantasy_plus_free_2012_nfl_season Thuuz Sports Update Brings Fantasy Plus, Free for 2012 NFL Season], ''Maclife'', 13 September 2012.

==Overview==


Thuuz attempts to create an objective rating for each game by analyzing live feeds of play-by-play statistics, and measuring six different factors: pace, parity, momentum, social media buzz, novelty, and context. Proprietary algorithms process this data and rate games on a color-coded 0-100 point excitement scale. The score 0-39 is rated as "dull", 40-64 as "OK", 65-84 as "Good" and 85-100 as "Great" with the color becomes darker red as the score increases. Real-time and archived game ratings are displayed. Thuuz also forecasts the ratings for the upcoming games as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/thuuz-aims-to-tip-sports-fans-to-hot-games/article1699729/ Thuuz Aims to Tip Sports Fans to Hot Games], ''The Globe and Mail'', 8 September 2010.  Retrieved: 11 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Thuuz sends registered fans live alerts by SMS text or email, permitting a user to tune into a game of interest.  Fans may personalize the sports and leagues they are interested in, list favorite teams, and the level of excitement at which they wish to receive an alert.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2011/03/19/134682384/Thuuz-Sends-A-Heads-Up-When-Sports-Get-Exciting.html Thuuz Sends A Heads Up When Sports Get Exciting], ''NPR Weekend Edition Saturday'', 19 March 2011.  Retrieved: 11 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Thuuz has teamed with partners such as [[Dish Network]] and [[Google TV]] to integrate Thuuz ratings with televised sports, helping interactive TV viewers to discover, watch, and record exciting games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dishs-game-finder-app-alerts-154500976.html DISH's Game Finder App Alerts Fans to Games With Best Action as It Happens, Tracks Scores on Screen], ''Yahoo Finance'', 13 September 2012.

Retrieved: 27 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-game ratings provide guidance for fans who have recorded multiple events for time-shifted viewing or who wish to watch televised or online replays. Game results are not displayed, so fans can choose the best games to watch without losing the element of suspense, and avoid wasting time on games that turn out to be dull.  Thuuz will also suggest the best point in each game to start watching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1176370/index.htm You've Gotta See This], ''Sports Illustrated'', 1 November 2010.

Thuuz also employs its algorithms to offer predictions on which upcoming games are anticipated to be most exciting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703899704576204661653414694 Set Your DVR for the Following Games], ''The Wall Street Journal - The Count'', 17 March 2011.   Retrieved: 11 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

By aggregating minute-by-minute excitement ratings over the course of a season, Thuuz generates lists of the most exciting games, teams, leagues&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/blog/bigten/post/_/id/22734/big-ten-the-nations-most-exciting-league Big Ten the nation's most exciting league?], ''ESPN Big Ten Blog'', 24 January 2011.

'''University Stadium''' is a multipurpose stadium located on the campus grounds of the [[University of Manitoba]] in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada.  It features a 400m 8-lane track, as well as separate areas for [[long jump]]/[[triple jump]], [[high jump]], [[pole vault]], [[Discus throw|discus]], [[Hammer throw|hammer]], [[shot put]], and [[Javelin throw|javelin]].  Inside the track is a large natural grass field used for [[Canadian football|football]] and [[soccer]].  The stadium was home to the [[Manitoba Bisons]] football team until the team relocated next door to [[Investors Group Field]] in 2013.

The stadium was originally constructed as the track and field venue for the [[1967 Pan American Games]].  After the games, the stadium was turned over to the University of Manitoba and became home to the  university's football team and track and field program.  It was upgraded in 1973 and later again prior to the [[1999 Pan American Games]], when a new track and other facilities were installed.  The stadium has a permanent seating capacity of 5,000, which has been augmented with temporary seating during major events. The facility is wheelchair accessible, has an adjacent parking lot, and is served by public transit.&lt;ref name="wed" /&gt;

'''Westfalenstadion''' ({{IPA-de|vɛstˈfaːlnˌʃtaːdi̯ɔn|-|}})&lt;ref&gt;The syllable that carries the primary stress is phonemically disyllabic {{IPA|/-ˈfaːl.ən-/}}. In normal speech, {{IPA|/ən/}} assimilates to non-syllabic (because of the preceding {{IPA|/l/}}) {{IPA-de|n|}} and attaches to the previous syllable, so that it is pronounced monosyllabically {{IPA-de|-ˈfaːln-|}}. The pronunciation {{IPA-de|-ˈfaːln̩-|}}, with a syllabic {{IPA-de|n̩|}} is not possible.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Dortmund]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany, which is the home of  [[Borussia Dortmund]]. Officially called '''Signal Iduna Park''' {{IPA-de|zɪɡˌnaːl ʔiˈduːnaː ˌpaʁk||}}&lt;ref name="RuhrN"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/sport/bvb/bvbnews/BVB-spielt-bis-2021-im-Signal-Iduna-Park;art11635,1640456| title = BVB spielt bis 2021 im "Signal-Iduna-Park" | date = 9 May 2012 | publisher   = Ruhr Nachrichten | accessdate =9 May 2012 | trans-title = BVB to play until 2021 in "Signal Iduna Park" | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; for sponsorship reasons, the name derives from the former [[Prussia]]n province of [[Westphalia]].

It holds the European record for average fan attendance, set in the 2011–2012 season with almost 1.37 million spectators over 17 games at an average of 80,588 per game.&lt;ref name="RuhrN" /&gt; Sales of annual [[season ticket]]s amounted to 55,000 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=28 July 2015 |title=Bundesliga-Vergleich - So viele Dauerkarten verkauften die 18 Klubs! |url=http://sportbild.bild.de/bundesliga/2015/bundesliga/so-viele-dauerkarten-verkauften-die-18-klubs-41974370.sport.html |language=German |newspaper=Sport Bild |publisher=BILD GmbH &amp; Co.

The 24,454 capacity ''Südtribüne'' (South Bank) is the largest terrace for standing spectators in European football.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.derwesten.de/staedte/dortmund/Stadt-Dortmund-sieht-Suedtribuene-als-Denkmal-id2234163.html Stadt Dortmund sieht Südtribüne als Denkmal] (in German) DerWesten, 08.12.2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gelbe&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/in-germany-every-game-has-the-feel-of-a-cup-final-says-mcclaren-2080305.html 'In Germany, every game has the feel of a cup final,'] The Independent, 16 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Famous for the intense atmosphere it breeds, the south terrace has been nicknamed the "Yellow Wall".&lt;ref name=Gelbe/&gt; The Borusseum, the museum of Borussia Dortmund, is near the stadium.

The stadium hosted matches in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]s. It also hosted the [[2001 UEFA Cup Final]]. Various national [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] and qualification matches for World and European tournaments have been played there as well as matches in European club competitions.

==History==
Plans to construct a new stadium were drawn up in the 1960s, as the need arose to expand and refurbish the traditional ground of Borussia Dortmund, the [[Stadion Rote Erde]] ("Red Soil Stadium"). Following the historic triumph in the [[1965–66 European Cup Winners' Cup|1966 Cup Winners' Cup]] (Dortmund was the first German team to win a European club title), it became clear that the Stadion Rote Erde was too small for the increasing number of Borussia Dortmund supporters. The city of Dortmund, however, was not able to finance a new stadium and federal institutions were unwilling to help.

In 1971, Dortmund was selected to replace the city of [[Cologne]], which was forced to withdraw its plans to host games in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]]. The funds originally set aside for the projected stadium in Cologne were thus re-allocated to Dortmund. However, architects and planners had to keep an eye on the costs due to a tight budget. This meant that plans for a 60 million [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] oval stadium featuring the traditional athletic facilities and holding 60,000 spectators had to be discarded. Instead, plans for a much cheaper 54,000 spectator football arena, built of pre-fabricated concrete sections, became a reality. Ultimately, the costs amounted to 32.7 million DM, of which 1.6 million DM were invested in the refurbishment of the Stadion Rote Erde. The city of Dortmund, initially burdened with 6 million DM, only had to pay 800,000 DM, and quickly profited from the stadium's high revenues.
On 2 April 1974, Borussia Dortmund officially moved into their new home and has played in the Westfalenstadion ever since. Having been [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] in 1972, Borussia Dortmund was the only member of the [[2. Bundesliga]] (second Division) to host the 1974 World Cup games in a completely new stadium. In 1976, after promotion to the [[Bundesliga]], Borussia Dortmund played its first game in Germany's highest division in their new home stadium.

On 16 May 2001, the Westfalenstadion hosted the [[2001 UEFA Cup Final]] between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Deportivo Alavés|Alavés]].

==1974 FIFA World Cup==
In the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], the Westfalenstadion hosted three group stage games and one final group game. The maximum capacity of the stadium was 54,000.

==2006 FIFA World Cup==
The stadium was one of the venues for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. Due to sponsorship contracts, however, the arena was called ''FIFA World Cup Stadium Dortmund'' during the World Cup.

Six games were played there during the tournament, including Germany's first loss ever at the stadium, a 2–0 defeat to Italy. Also, Trinidad and Tobago played their first ever World Cup match at the stadium, against Sweden.

==Layout==
Situated directly next to Stadion Rote Erde, the Westfalenstadion is composed of four roofed grandstands, each facing the playing field on the east, south, west and north sides. The eastern and western stands (Ost- und Westtribüne) run the entire length of the field, while the breadth is covered by the north and south stands (Nord- und Südtribüne).

Originally, the corners between the four grandstands remained empty and the spectators appreciated the extensive roof, which covered over 80% of the stands. The eastern and western stands housed the stadium's 17,000 seats, while the 37,000 standing places were housed in the northern and southern stands.

Located on the southern terrace of the stadium is Dortmund's "Yellow Wall", which is the largest free-standing grandstand in Europe with a capacity of 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2012/dec/02/borussia-dortmund-yellow-wall-in-pictures|title=Borussia Dortmund's Yellow Wall - in pictures|first=Gary|last=Calton|date=2 December 2012|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Yellow Wall" gives Westfalenstadion one of the most intimidating home atmospheres in all of Europe, aiding Borussia Dortmund to an unbeaten home campaign in the [[UEFA Champions League]] in [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|2012–13]].&lt;ref name="espnfc.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/stats?league=uefa.champions# |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230071715/http://espnfc.com/stats?league=uefa.champions# |archive-date=30 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansions==
[[File:Leeres Westfalenstadion.jpg|thumb|left|Westfalenstadion seen from inside.]]

The first expansion plans are dated back to 1961, although the funding required was not available until 4 October 1971 when the city council decided to rebuild the stadium between 1971 and 1974 for the [[FIFA World Cup]]. As part of the extensions an additional roof was added around the stadium that weighed 3000 tons.

The original capacity of 54,000 was reduced in 1992 due to [[UEFA]] regulations. As the standing rows on the entire northern, the lower eastern and the lower western grandstands were converted into seats, the capacity shrank to 42,800. With 26,000 seats (of which 23,000 were covered), the seating in the Westfalenstadion now outnumbered the standing rows.

[[File:Suedtribuene.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The south stand, ''Die Südtribüne'', is the largest free-standing grandstand in Europe. Fans call it "Die gelbe Wand", which means "The Yellow Wall"]]&lt;ref name="espnfc.com"/&gt;
After Borussia Dortmund won the Bundesliga in 1995, the Westfalenstadion was expanded yet again. In the first private venture stadium expansion in German history, the two main grandstands, the eastern and the western blocks, received a second tier. Covered by a new roof-construction, each section housed an additional 6,000 seats. Thus, the stadium's capacity was restored to the original 54,000, of which the majority (38,500) were now covered seats. Following Dortmund's [[1996–97 UEFA Champions League|1997]] UEFA Champions League victory, success and an ever-growing number of enthusiastic fans made it necessary to enlarge the Westfalenstadion yet again. The southern and northern grandstands were enlarged this time, boosting the total capacity to 68,800 spectators. The southern standing ranks (''"Die Südtribüne"'', where the home team's supporters gather) became the largest free-standing grandstand of its kind in the whole of Europe, with a capacity of 25,000.

[[File:Westfalenstadion-207-.JPG|thumb|left|The yellow pylons that give the stadium its characteristic exterior.]]
Now it is considered one of the biggest and most comfortable stadiums in Europe. The last renovation was made for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The stadium has a glass front, under-soil heating (allowing matches in winter) and the biggest terraced stand. It is Germany’s largest stadium capacity of 81,360. The expansion was realised by the German architectural firm of [[Architekten Schröder Schulte-Ladbeck]]. There are four video screens inside the stadium. The fifth screen on the outside of the north stands is smaller, measuring 28 square meters.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Since 1 December 2005, Westfalenstadion carries the name of Signal Iduna Park, under an agreement which lasts until 2021.

When Germany won the World Cup bid in 2000, it became clear that Westfalenstadion would play a leading role in hosting the tournament. [[File:Borusseum.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Borusseum'', a museum about [[Borussia Dortmund]], opened in 2008.]]However, as the Westfalenstadion failed to fulfill [[FIFA]] requirements for hosting semi-finals, it had to be enlarged a third time. Four new stands were built to fill the corners between the existing grandstands, raising the [[seating capacity]] for international games from 52,000 to 67,000. Additionally, the new corner elements provide seating and catering to VIP guests, increasing the total number of VIP seats to 5,000. In order to provide the new sections with an unblocked view of the field, the existing interior roof supports were removed and replaced by exterior pylons, which were painted yellow to suit the Borussia Dortmund colors. During the course of those renovations, construction workers found an undetonated 1,000–pound (450&amp;nbsp;kg) bomb dropped by an Allied bomber in [[World War II]] that was only about one metre below the halfway line on the pitch. Bomb disposal experts had to evacuate the stadium and surrounding neighbourhood in Dortmund, which as part of Germany's industrial centre was bombed heavily, before taking an hour to defuse the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The stadium now hosts up to 81,365 fans (standing and seated) for league matches, and 65,829 seated spectators for international games. For these, the characteristic Southern grandstand is re-equipped with seats to conform with FIFA regulations.

The Stadium is set to undergo some renovation works in 2018 with the stadium's capacity to rise to 81,365 for Bundesliga Matches and 66,099 for international matches.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/borussia-dortmund-to-add-6-seats-to-signal-iduna-park-507331.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Owners==
The property of the Westfalenstadion, originally belonging to the city of Dortmund and later sold to the club Borussia Dortmund, was sold to a real estate trust in 2002 when the club was facing serious financial problems. Following that, Westfalenstadion was in the possession of [[Florian Homm]] for about two years,{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} it was sold back to a real estate trust with Borussia Dortmund intending to repurchase the stadium gradually up to 2017. However the club was not able to pay the regular rates in spring 2005 and the holders of the trust agreed in cutting back the asset's interest rates and allowed the club to pay the rates after financial reorganisation. Because of these measures, bankruptcy of the club was avoided and the future of the facility was secured. In 2006 Borussia Dortmund became the new owner by buying the stadium back with the help of a loan from Morgan Stanley.

In order to reduce debt, the naming rights to the stadium was sold to an insurance company, [[Signal Iduna]]. From 2005 until 2021, the stadium will be known as the "Signal Iduna Park". During the 2006 World Cup, however, the stadium was called "FIFA World Cup Stadium Dortmund", since FIFA controls all naming rights in connection with the World Cup.

==Transport==
[[File:Dortmund Möllerbrücke HDR.jpg|thumb|Subway Station Möllerbrücke]]
Signal Iduna Park can be reached with the [[Dortmund Stadtbahn]] (light rail) lines U42 (''Theodor-Fliedner-Heim'' Station), U45 (''Stadion'' Station), U46 (''[[Westfalenhallen (VRR)|Westfalenhallen]]'' Station and also ''Stadion''). The U45 and U46 are unique in that they serve the special station, ''Stadion'', that is open on game days only. Additionally ''[[Deutsche Bahn]]'' serves the ''[[Dortmund Signal-Iduna-Park station|Dortmund Signal-Iduna-Park]]'' station with both regularly scheduled and special game-day trains. This station can be reached using regional [[Regionalbahn|RB]] trains from [[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof|Dortmund Central Station]], as well as from other cities in the metropolitan area, such as [[Hagen]], [[Iserlohn]], and [[Lüdenscheid]]. However, some supporters usually alight the U42 and S4 at the ''[[Dortmund Möllerbrücke station|Möllerbrücke]]'' station and walk to Signal Iduna Park through the ''Kreuzviertel'' via ''Lindemannstraße'' or ''Arneckestraße''.

The stadium can be reached from [[Dortmund Airport]] by taking the shuttle bus to the Holzwickede/Dortmund Airport train station, taking train [[Hellweg Net#RB 59: Hellweg-Bahn|RB59]] towards Dortmund Central Station and getting out at ''Signal Iduna Park''.

By car the stadium can be reached via the B 1 ''Ruhrschnellweg'' and B 54. Parking is also available at [[Dortmund University of Technology]], where shuttle busses take fans to the stadium.

===Surroundings===
[[File:Kreuzviertel Althoffblock alte Hoeschzentrale von Florianturm.jpg|thumb|Surrounding Area - Kreuzviertel.]]
From the subway station ''[[Dortmund Möllerbrücke station|Möllerbrücke]]'' visitors approach the stadium through the [[Kreuzviertel]]. It is well known for its many bars, clubs, pubs, and cafes, concentrated in the vicinity of Kreuzstraße and Vinkeplatz and create a day and nightlife atmosphere unique from the rest of the city. That's the reason why the subway station and the city quarter is popular by local fans and those visiting of Borussia Dortmund as a last resort for drinking a cheep beer in the numerous Pubs around the Stadium. On match days, many traders sell beer, sausages (Bratwurst) and jerseys on the street

On the other side of the Autobahn, the [[Trade fair]] with its [[Westfalenhallen]] and TV Tower called [[Florianturm]] affords a marvellous view on the stadium.
