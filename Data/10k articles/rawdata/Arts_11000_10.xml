'''Barbara Radding Morgan''' (born November 28, 1951) is an American [[teacher]] and a former [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]. She participated in the [[Teacher in Space Project|Teacher in Space]] program as backup to [[Christa McAuliffe]] for the 1986 ill-fated [[STS-51-L]] mission of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']]. She then trained as a [[Mission Specialist]], and flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007.

==Early life and education==
Morgan was born to Dr. and Mrs. Jerry Radding in 1951 and raised in [[Fresno, California]], where she attended [[Herbert Hoover High School (Fresno)|Herbert Hoover High School]]. Following graduation in 1969, she was accepted to [[Stanford University]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], where she graduated with distinction in 1973 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[human biology|Human Biology]]. She obtained her teaching credential from [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] in nearby [[Belmont, California|Belmont]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="bio1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/morgan.html|title=Barbara Radding Morgan - NASA Astronaut biography|accessdate=September 15, 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070922021122/http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/morgan.html| archivedate= 22 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching career==
Morgan began her teaching career in 1974 on the [[Flathead Indian Reservation]] at Arlee Elementary School in [[Arlee, Montana]], where she taught remedial reading and math. From 1975 to 1978, she taught remedial reading/math and second grade at McCall-Donnelly Elementary School in [[McCall, Idaho]]. From 1978 to 1979, Morgan taught English and science to third graders at [[Colegio Americano de Quito]]  in [[Quito, Ecuador]], for a year. From 1979 to 1998, Morgan taught second, third, and fourth grades at McCall-Donnelly Elementary School.&lt;ref name=ellis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Lee|title=Who's who of NASA astronauts|date=2002|publisher=Americana Group Pub.|location=River Falls, WI|isbn=0966796144|page=131|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0966796144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teacher in Space Project==
[[Image:Teacher in Space Project McAuliffe and Morgan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Christa McAuliffe]] and Morgan in 1985.]]
Morgan was selected as the backup candidate for the NASA [[Teacher in Space Project]] on July 19, 1985. From September 1985 to January 1986, Morgan trained with [[Christa McAuliffe]] and the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] crew at NASA's [[Johnson Space Center]], [[Houston, Texas]]. Following McAuliffe's death in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]], Morgan assumed the duties of Teacher in Space Designee. From March 1986 to July 1986, she worked with NASA, speaking to educational organizations throughout the country. In the fall of 1986, Morgan returned to Idaho to resume her teaching career. She taught second and third grades at McCall-Donnelly Elementary and continued to work with NASA's Education Division, Office of Human Resources and Education. Her duties as Teacher in Space Designee included public speaking, educational consulting, curriculum design, and serving on the [[National Science Foundation]]'s Federal Task Force for Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Marcia | last=Dunn | coauthors= | title= NASA's Barbara Morgan Still Grounded Following Tragedy | date=2003-11-06 | publisher=Space.com | url =http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/ap_morgan_031106.html | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-22 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASA career==
In January 1998, 12 years after McAuliffe's death, Morgan was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate ([[Mission Specialist]]) and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1998 to begin training to become a full-time astronaut. Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation, she was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Space Station Operations Branch. She served in the Astronaut Office [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]] Branch, working in [[Mission Control]] as prime communicator with on-orbit crews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jim |last=Banke |title= Barbara Morgan Rides Wave of Fame, Awaits Flight Assignment |date=2002-05-21 |publisher=Space.com |url =http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0605/17sts117118/ |accessdate= 2007-08-22 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110229/http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0605/17sts117118/| archivedate= 29 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other astronauts and [[cosmonaut]]s, Morgan is a licensed [[amateur radio]] operator, having passed the technician class license exam in 2003. This qualified her to use the facilities of the [[Amateur Radio on the International Space Station]] (ARISS) project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=ARRL | coauthors= | title=Educator Astronaut Barbara Morgan, KD5VNP, Gets Ready to Launch into Space | date=2007-08-07 | publisher=ARRL Amateur Radio | url =http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2007/08/08/100/ | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-22 | language = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930203331/http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2007/08/08/100/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qrz"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.qrz.com/detail/KD5VNP|title=Barbara Morgan - HAM Radio information| accessdate=September 22, 2007| publisher=QRZ.com| year=2003|author=QRZ| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002720/http://www.qrz.com/detail/KD5VNP| archivedate= 27 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan's duties as a Mission Specialist were no different than those of other crew members. While NASA press releases and media briefings often referred to her as a "Mission Specialist Educator" or "Educator Astronaut", Morgan did not train in the [[Educator Astronaut Project]]. [[NASA Administrator]] [[Michael D. Griffin]] clarified at a press conference after STS-118 that Morgan was not considered a Mission Specialist Educator, but rather was a standard Mission Specialist, who had been a teacher.&lt;ref name="press1"&gt;{{Cite news | title=STS-118 Post-landing news conference - Comments by Dr. Michael Griffin, Administrator of NASA|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=Michael Griffin|work=NASA TV Post-landing news conference - August 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to her flight on STS-118, NASA seemed to limit Morgan's exposure to the press, but she did a series of interviews shortly before the start of the mission about what the crew of STS-118 would be doing to help build the International Space Station,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Marcia | last=Franklin | coauthors= | title=Parabolic Tales: An Idaho journalist endeavors to tell an astronaut's story | date=2007-08-01 | publisher=Boise weekly | url =http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A259421 | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-22 | language = | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070810100046/http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A259421| archivedate= 10 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=NASA | coauthors= | title=Preflight Interview: Barbara Morgan | year=2006 | publisher=NASA | url =http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts118/morgan_interview.html | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-22 | language = | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070825115455/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts118/morgan_interview.html| archivedate= 25 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= NASA | coauthors= | title=Second preflight Interview with Barbara Morgan | date= | publisher=NASA | url =http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts118/interview2_morgan.html | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-13 | language = | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070920192310/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts118/interview2_morgan.html| archivedate= 20 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=Associated Press | coauthors= | title= After 22-year wait, teacher ready for space trip | date=2007-08-07 | publisher=CNN | url =http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/space/08/07/morgan.profile.ap/index.html | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-22 | language = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070918045821/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/space/08/07/morgan.profile.ap/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; commenting, "You know, there's a great sense of pride to be able to be involved in a human endeavor that takes us all a little bit farther. When you look down and see our Earth, and you realize what we are trying to do as a human race, it's pretty profound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Tariq | last=Malik | coauthors= | title= Teacher-Astronaut, Crewmates Glad to be Home | date=2007-08-22 | publisher=Space.com | url =http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/070821_sts118_crew.html | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-22 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks after Morgan's mission ended, she conducted her first space education assignment at [[Walt Disney World]] in Florida. Morgan's words from that day were etched into a plaque on a wall of Mission: Space. The "Wall of Honor" contains quotes from notable people, such as [[Neil Armstrong]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Charles Lindbergh]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Carl Sagan]], [[Galileo]], and Christa McAuliffe. Morgan's plaque is placed beside McAuliffe's, which says: "Space is for everybody ... That's our new frontier out there."&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/space/09/10/teacher.astronaut/index.html|title= Teacher-astronaut takes mission to Disney|accessdate=September 12, 2007|publisher=CNN / Associated Press|year=2007|author=Associated Press |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070917032359/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/space/09/10/teacher.astronaut/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was one of a series of lectures Morgan would complete.

===Spaceflight experience===
[[STS-118]], an assembly mission to the [[International Space Station]], successfully launched from Florida's [[Kennedy Space Center]] at 6:36:42&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT, 8 August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=NASA | coauthors= | title=STS-118 Status Report 01 | date=2007-08-09 | publisher=NASA | url =http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts118/news/STS-118-01.html | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-13 | language = |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823131906/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts118/news/STS-118-01.html|archivedate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan served as [[Remote Manipulator System|robotic arm]] operator, and transfer coordinator, coordinating the transfer of over {{convert|5000|lb|kg}} of cargo to the International Space Station, and bringing home over {{convert|3000|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=NASA | coauthors= | title=STS-118 Status Report #13 | date=2007-08-14 | publisher=NASA | url =http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts118/news/STS-118-13.html | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-15 | language = |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823131906/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts118/news/STS-118-13.html|archivedate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her other duties, Morgan participated in twenty-minute amateur radio question-and-answer sessions with young people at the Discovery Center of Idaho and other centers, and joined Mission Specialist [[Alvin Drew]] in an education event with young people at the [[Challenger Center for Space Science Education]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="ham1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/STS118_morgan_radio.html|title=Barbara Morgan Talks With Students on Ham Radio|accessdate=September 12, 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070822024053/http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/STS118_morgan_radio.html| archivedate= 22 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=John | last=Schwartz | coauthors= | title=Astronaut Teaches in Space, and Lesson Is Bittersweet | date=2007-08-15 | publisher=New York Times | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/15/science/space/15shuttle.html | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-22 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was hosted by June Scobee, widow of Space Shuttle ''Challenger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s commander, [[Dick Scobee|Richard "Dick" Scobee]].

==Background==
[[File:Casa Santa Museum.jpeg|thumbnail|Casa Santa Museum]]
One of the most famous attractions east of [[Metro Manila]], located in the hills of [[Antipolo]], just 30 minutes away from Ortigas is the CASA SANTA @ Jardin de Miramar.

The Casa Santa houses an internationally recognized collection of [[Santa Claus]] items ranging from life size, singing santas to Turkish inspired bronze plaques of Santa Claus. At present, it is probably the most extensive private collection of Santa Claus items in the world with over  3,700++ santas. And unlike traditional [[museum]]s, the Casa Santa is a fun museum in that the visitors are free to inspect the items closely, or in some cases, play with it.

Casa Santa started out as a small personal collection and it grew in size until it needed a house where the Santas could "live." The Casa Santa was converted from a family resthouse into a museum of Santa Claus collection in 1995.  The house was remodeled by folk architect Rosario Encarnacion Tan and the [[Lighting designer|lighting design]] inside the museum was crafted by international Japanese light designer Shoko Matsumoto.

In December 2004, it was the cover of ''Starweek'''s Christmas and in Christmas 2008 appeared in the front page of the ''[[Philippine Inquirer]]''. It has appeared in over 50 T.V. and movie productions -- ''[[Rated K]]'', ''[[Wish Ko Lang]]'','' [[Unang Hirit]]'', ''Magandang Umagang Bayan'', ''US Girls'', ''[[Boy and Kris]]''.  On international television, it was covered by two  news agencies, [[Reuters]] and [[Associated Press]].

Addition to the collection is a room full of miniature [[Christmas village]]s.  A starter collection in the loft was displayed in 2010. After acquiring a significant number of mini- houses this year, it was given a room of its own.  The village was designed by Bamboo Tonogbanua of [[Bacolod]], himself a Christmas village collector.

NEWEST ATTRACTION

This 2015 a newly renovated Santa's village has been created by Christmas village miniature artist Bamboo Tonogbanua, a Cebuano Artist.

CASA SANTA PLAYROOM, a room designed to house small &amp; big santa stuffed toys collection. A colorful room designed, full of toys and entertaining surprises.

And by December, Jardin de Miramar has its newest &amp; modern facility, the Isla Palma Resort located within the compound.  It is nature-inspired and imprints a platform strategically made for thematic events, weddings, corporate parties,  cocktails, team building activities or simply for private celebrations.  Its setting creates a distinct feel of being in an island with a pavilion seating 300 persons and a 250 sq m wrap-around pool. Discover the tropical allure of the Isla Palma Resort – a quiet haven with an urban feel set in the midst of a countryside locale.

Another curious item in the Jardin de Miramar is the restored [[Noah's Ark]] found in the Galera and surrounded by a rustic playground. Noah's Ark is newly renovated multi-colored fishing boat artistically reconstructed into a play area.  And like any work of art in Jardin, this old boat not only serves as a charming relic that is lovely to look at.  It is a hardworking piece of art where children can play "sailor and pirate, hike and seek, go up and down the lighthouse and pyramid tree, run along the bridges and do the monkey swings. .

Jardin has extended its collection to other works of art such as the sculptures/creation of nationally recognized artists Ed Castrillo, Michael Cacnio, Daniel dela Cruz, Tony Leano, Ral Arrogante, mural works by Alfred Galvez; mosaic works by Hannah Liongoren. The three-hectare Jardin de Miramar is also the most popular party venue in the East and is the only wedding and party place  with each of the 9 venues having a thematic look and character.   It is also popular as a prenuptial photo shoot venue.

'''China Arts and Entertainment Group''' ('''CAEG'''), was created on April 5, 2004 with the merger of the '''China Performing Arts Agency''' (1957) and the '''China International Exhibition Agency''' (1950) to become the largest state-owned [[creative enterprise]] in [[China]]. It was a major step to transform Chinese cultural and art institutions into modern enterprises.

CAEG is under the administration of the [[Minister of Culture]]. The group consists of 19 [[wholly owned]] enterprises, two [[shareholding]] enterprises and one [[Joint-stock company|Stock company]].

There have been a variety of '''Christian views on poverty and wealth'''. At one end of the spectrum is a view which casts wealth and materialism as an evil to be avoided and even combatted.  At the other end is a view which casts prosperity and well-being as a blessing from God. 

Many taking the former position address the topic in relation to the modern [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal capitalism]] that shapes the Western world. [[Americans|American]] [[theologian]] [[John B. Cobb]] has argued that the "economism that rules the West and through it much of the East" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that "man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)". He asserts that it is obvious that "Western society is organized in the service of wealth" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West.&lt;ref name="Cobb, Jr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern View of Economics |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3607 |first=John B. |last=Cobb, Jr. |accessdate=2011-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906075839/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3607 |archivedate=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scottish people|Scottish]] theologian Jack Mahoney has characterized the saying of Jesus in {{bibleref|Mark|10:23–27}} as having "imprinted themselves so deeply on the Christian community through the centuries that those who are well off, or even comfortably off, often feel uneasy and troubled in conscience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Companion encyclopedia of theology |first=Jack |last=Mahoney |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1995 |page=759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians argue that a proper understanding of Christian teachings on wealth and poverty needs to take a larger view where the accumulation of wealth is not the central focus of one's life but rather a resource to foster the "good life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Church and Society: Orthodox Christian Perspectives, Past Experiences, and Modern Challenges |first=George P. |last=Liacopulos |publisher=Somerset Hall Press |year=2007 |page=88 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xxY3gfmzdwwC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Christianity+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780977461059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[David W. Miller]] has constructed a three-part rubric which presents three prevalent attitudes among Protestants towards wealth.  According to this rubric, Protestants have variously viewed wealth as: (1) an offense to the Christian faith (2) an obstacle to faith and (3) the outcome of faith.&lt;ref name="Miller2007"&gt;Miller, David W. "Wealth Creation as Integrated with Faith: A Protestant Reflection" Muslim, Christian, and Jewish Views on the Creation of Wealth April 23–24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth and faith==

===Wealth as an offense to faith===

According to historian Alan S. Kahan, there is a strand of Christianity that views the wealthy man as "especially sinful". In this strand of Christianity, Kahan asserts, the day of judgment is viewed as a time when "the social order will be turned upside down and ... the poor will turn out to be the ones truly blessed."&lt;ref name=Kahan43&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S. |last=Kahan |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote "Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things."

David Miller suggests that this view is similar to that of the third century [[Manichaeanism|Manicheans]] who saw the spiritual world as being good and the material world as evil with the two being in irreconcilable conflict with each other.&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt;  Thus, this strand of Christianity exhorts Christians to renounce material and worldly pleasures in order to follow Jesus.  As an example, Miller cites Jesus' injunction to his disciples to "take nothing for the journey."{{bibleref2|Mark|6:8–9}}

The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] advocate [[voluntary poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/daytext.cfm?TextID=150 |title=More About Holy Poverty. Which Is Voluntary Poverty. |author=[[Dorothy Day]] |date=February 1945 |work= |publisher=[[The Catholic Worker]] |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=A Penny a Copy: Readings from the Catholic Worker |first=Tom | last=Cornell |authorlink=Tom Cornell |first2=Robert | last2=Ellsberg|authorlink2=Robert Ellsberg |year=1995 |page=198 |publisher=Orbis Books |quote=At its deepest level voluntary poverty is a way of seeing the world and the things of the world.… The Gospels are quite clear: the rich man is told to sell all he has and give to the poor, for it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven. And we are clearly instructed that 'you can not serve God and Mammon'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians, such as [[New Monasticism|New Monastics]], may choose to reject personal wealth and follow an [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle, in part as a protest against "a church and public that embraces wealth, luxury and ostentatious power."&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahlbusch|first=Erwin|title=The Encyclopedia Of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5V7oyy69zgC&amp;pg=PA307|accessdate=18 June 2012|year=2005|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2416-5|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth as an obstacle to faith===
According to David Miller, [[Martin Luther]] viewed Mammon (or the desire for wealth) as "the most common idol on earth".  Miller cites Jesus' encounter with the rich ruler {{bibleverse|Mark|10:17–31}} as an example of wealth being an obstacle to faith.  According to Miller, it is not the rich man's wealth per se that is the obstacle but rather the man's reluctance to give up that wealth in order to follow Jesus.  Miller cites [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s observation in [[First Epistle to Timothy|1st Timothy]] that, “people who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction." {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|6:9}}.  Paul continues on with the observation that "the love of money is the root of all evil."
{{bibleverse|1|Timothy|6:10}}  Miller emphasizes that "it is the love of money that is the obstacle to faith, not the money itself."&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!" The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is[a] to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the [[Eye of a needle#Christianity|eye of a needle]] than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?" Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kahan cites Jesus' injunction against amassing material wealth as an example that the "good [Christian] life was one of poverty and charity, storing up treasures in heaven instead of earth.&lt;ref name=Kahan43 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. {{bibleverse|Matthew|6|19:21}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jesus counsels his followers to remove from their lives those things which cause them to sin, saying "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to go with two hands into hell, where the fire never goes out." {{bibleref2|Mark|9:42–49}}.  In order to remove the desire for wealth and material possessions as an obstacle to faith, some Christians have taken vows of poverty.  Christianity has a long tradition of voluntary poverty which is manifested in the form of asceticism, charity and almsgiving.&lt;ref name=WellsQuash&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Christian Ethics |first1=Samuel |last1=Wells |first2=Ben |last2=Quash|publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |page=244 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ezy6wZJHFCoC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=Christian+land+wealth+usury#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20land%20wealth%20usury&amp;f=false|isbn=9781405152778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kahan argues that Christianity is unique because it sparked the beginning of a phenomenon which he calls the "Great Renunciation" in which "millions of people would renounce sex and money in God's name."&lt;ref name=Kahan43/&gt;

In [[Roman Catholicism]], poverty is one of the [[evangelical counsels]].  Pope [[Benedict XVI]] distinguishes "poverty ''chosen''" (the poverty of spirit proposed by Jesus), and "poverty ''to be fought''" (unjust and imposed poverty). He considers that the moderation implied in the former favors solidarity, and is a necessary condition so as to fight effectively to eradicate the abuse of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20090101_world-day-peace_en.htmlWorldPeaceDayAddress2009 Homily of His Holiness Benedict XVI]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[religious institute]]s also take a [[vow]] of extreme poverty. For example, the [[Franciscan]] orders have traditionally foregone all individual and corporate forms of ownership.

===Wealth as an outcome of faith===
One line of Protestant thinking views the pursuit of wealth as not only acceptable but as a religious calling or duty.  This perspective is generally ascribed to [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[Puritan]] theologies, which view hard work and frugal lifestyles as spiritual acts in themselves.  [[John Wesley]] was a strong proponent of gaining wealth, according to his famous "Sermon 50," in which he said, "gain all you can, save all you can and give all you can."&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt; It is impossible to give to charity if one is poor; John Wesley and his Methodists were noted for their consistently large contributions to charity in the form of churches, hospitals and schools.  

Included among those who view wealth as an outcome of faith are modern-day preachers and authors who propound [[prosperity theology]], teaching that God promises wealth and abundance to those who will believe in him and follow his laws. Prosperity theology (also known as the "health and wealth gospel") is a [[Christianity|Christian]] religious belief whose proponents claim the [[Bible]] teaches that financial blessing is the will of [[God in Christianity|God]] for Christians. Most teachers of prosperity theology maintain that a combination of [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], positive speech, and donations to specific Christian ministries will always cause an increase in material wealth for those who practice these actions. Prosperity theology is almost always taught in conjunction with [[continuationism]].

Prosperity theology first came to prominence in the [[United States]] during the [[Healing Revival]]s in the 1950s. Some commentators have linked the genesis of prosperity theology with the influence of the [[New Thought]] movement. It later figured prominently in the [[Word of Faith]] movement and 1980s [[televangelism]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, it became accepted by many influential leaders in the [[charismatic movement]] and has been promoted by Christian [[missionaries]] throughout the world. It has been harshly criticized by leaders of mainstream [[evangelicalism]] as a non-scriptural doctrine or as an outright [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]].

==Precursors to Christianity==

Professor [[Cosimo Perrotta]] describes the early Christian period as one which saw "the meeting and clash of three great cultures: the Classical, the Hebrew (of the Old Testament) and the Christian." Perrotta describes the cultures as having radically different views of money and wealth.  Whereas the Hebrew culture prized material wealth, the Classical and [[Christian culture]]s either held them in contempt or preached indifference to them.  However, Perrotta points out that the motivation of the Classical and Christian cultures for their attitudes were very different and thus the logical implications of the attitudes resulted in different outcomes.&lt;ref name=Perrotta43&gt;{{cite book |title=Consumption as an Investment: The fear of goods from Hesiod to Adam Smith|first=Cosimo |last=Perrotta |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004  |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2ogMXO-ZxbEC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20wealth%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780203694572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish attitudes in the Old Testament===
{{further|Jewish views of poverty, wealth and charity}}

Perrotta characterizes the attitude of the Jews as expressed in the Old Testament scriptures as being "completely different from the classical view."  He points out that servile and hired work was not scorned by the Jews of the Old Testament as it was by Greco-Roman thinkers.  Instead, such work was protected by biblical commandments to pay workers on time and not to cheat them.  The poor were protected from being exploited when in debt.  Perrotta asserts that the goal of these commandments was "not only to protect the poor but also to prevent the excessive accumulation of wealth in a few hands."  In essence, the poor man is "protected by God".  However, Perrotta points out that poverty is not admired nor is it considered a positive value by the writers of the Old Testament.  The poor are protected because the weak should be protected from exploitation.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44&gt;{{cite book |title=Consumption as an Investment: The fear of goods from Hesiod to Adam Smith|first=Cosimo |last=Perrotta |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004  |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2ogMXO-ZxbEC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20wealth%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780203694572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perrotta points out that material wealth is highly valued in the Old Testament; the Hebrews seek it and God promises to bless them with it if they will follow his commandments.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44 /&gt;  Joseph Francis Kelly writes that biblical writers leave no doubt that God enabled men such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Solomon to achieve wealth and that this wealth was a sign of divine favor.  However, Kelly also points out that the Old Testament insisted that the rich aid the poor.  Prophets such as Amos castigated the rich for oppressing the poor and crushing the needy.  In summary, Kelly writes that, "the Old Testament saw wealth as something good but warned the wealthy not to use their position to harm those with less.  The rich had an obligation to alleviate the sufferings of the poor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World of the early Christians |first=Joseph Francis |last=Kelly |publisher=Liturgical Press |year=1997 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3Pw-n3puQwsC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22Old+Testament%22+attitudes+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Old%20Testament%22%20attitudes%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9780814653135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
{{quote|''Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.''|[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#6:20|Luke 6:20]]}}

===The Gospels===
Jesus explicitly condemns excessive love of wealth as an intrinsic evil in various passages in the Gospels, especially in Luke (Luke 16:14–15 being an especially clear example).  He also consistently warns of the danger of riches as a hindrance to favor with God; as in the [[Parable of the Sower]], where it is said:

:"And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in; it chokes the Word, which becomes unfruitful"  – Mark 4:19.

Jesus makes [[Mammon]] a personification of riches, one in opposition to God, and which claims a person's service and loyalty as God does. But Jesus rejects the possibility of dual service on our part: for, he says, no one can serve both God and Mammon.

In the story of [[Jesus and the rich young man]] the young ruler's wealth inhibits him from following Jesus and thereby attaining the Kingdom. Jesus comments on the young man's discouragement thus:

:"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the [[eye of a needle]] than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."  Those who heard this were astonished, "Who then can be saved?", they asked.  Jesus replied, "What is impossible with man is possible with God."   – Luke 19:23–27

In the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]], Jesus exhorts his hearers to sell their earthly goods and give to the poor, and so provide themselves with "a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys" (Lk 12.33); and he adds "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Lk 12.34).

In [[The Parable of the Rich Fool]] Jesus tells the story of a rich man who decides to rest from all his labors, saying to himself:

:"And I will say to myself 'You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.' But God spoke to him, saying 'You fool! This very night your life will be required of you. Then who will get all that you have prepared for yourself?'" – Luke 12:16–20.

And Jesus adds, "This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God" (Lk 12.21).

[[Jesus and Zacchaeus]] (Lk 19.1–10) is an example of storing up heavenly treasure, and being rich toward God. The repentant tax collector Zacchaeus not only welcomes Jesus into his house but joyfully promises to give half of his possessions to the poor, and to rebate overpayments four times over if he defrauded anyone (Lk 19.8).

Luke strongly ties the right use of riches to discipleship; and securing heavenly treasure is linked with caring for the poor, the naked and the hungry, for God is supposed to have a special interest in the poor. This theme is consistent with God's protection and care of the poor in the Old Testament.

Thus, Jesus cites the words of the prophet Isaiah (Is:61.1–2) in proclaiming his mission:

:"The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."  – Luke 4:18–19

Luke, as is well known, had a particular concern for the poor as the subjects of Jesus' compassion and ministry. In his version of the [[Beatitudes]], the poor are blessed as the inheritors of God's kingdom (Lk 6.20–23), even as the corresponding curses are pronounced to the rich (Lk 6.24–26).

God's special interest in the poor is also expressed in the theme of the eschatological "great reversal" of fortunes between the rich and the poor in [[The Magnificat]] (Lk 1.46–55):

:He has shown the might of his arm:
:and has scattered the proud, in the conceit of their hearts.
:He has pulled down the mighty from their thrones,
:and exalted the lowly.
:He has filled the hungry with good things;
:and the rich has sent empty away.
:—Luke 1:51–53

and in Jesus repeated use of the tag "many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first" (Mt 19.30, Mt 20.16, Mk 10.31 &amp; Lk 13.30) and similar figures (Mt 23.12, Lk 14.11 &amp; Lk 18.14).

In the [[Parable of the Wedding Feast]], it is "the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame" who become God’s honored guests, while others reject the invitation because of their earthly cares and possessions (Lk 14.7–14).

===Acts of the Apostles===

Luke’s concern for the rich and the poor continues in the Acts with a greater focus on the unity of the nascent Christian communities. The two famous passages (2.43–45; 4.32–37), which have been appealed to throughout history as the “normative ideal” of the [[common ownership|community of goods]] for Christians, rather describe the extent of fellowship (koinōnia) in Jerusalem community as a part of distinctive Christian identity. Acts also portrays both positive and negative uses of wealth: those who practiced almsgiving and generosity to the poor (9.36; 10.2, 4) and those who gave priority to money over the needs of others (5.1–11; 8.14–24).

===Epistles===
For Paul, riches mainly denotes the character and activity of God and Christ – spiritual blessings and/of salvation – (e.g., Rom. 2.4; 9.23; 2 Cor. 8.9; Eph. 1.7, 18; 2.4, 7) although he occasionally refers to typical Jewish piety and Greco-Roman moral teachings of the time, such as generosity (Rom. 12.8, 13; 2 Cor. 8.2; Eph. 4.28; 1 Tim. 6.17 ) and hospitality (1 Tim. 5.10) with warnings against pride (1 Tim. 6.17) and greed (1 Cor. 5.11; 1 Tim. 3.8). 1 Tim. 6.10 seems to reflect a popular Cynic-Stoic moral teaching of
the period: “the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.” Paul’s focus of generosity is devoted to the collection for the church in Jerusalem (Gal. 2.10; 1 Cor. 16.1–4; 2 Cor 8.1 – 9.15; Rom. 15.25–31) as an important symbol of unity between Jewish and gentile believers with an appeal to material and spiritual reciprocity. It is also noteworthy that Paul's teaching in 1 Tim 6:17 implies there were rich believers in the Early Church.

A concept related to the accumlation of wealth is [[World (theology)#Christianity|Worldliness]], which is denounced by the Epistles of James and John:  "Don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God" (Ja 4.4). The first letter of John says, in a similar vein: "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him” (1 Jn 2:15).

The Epistle of James also stands out for its vehement condemnation of the oppressive rich, who were presumably outsiders to the Christian community, which mainly consisted of the poor. Adopting the [[Psalter]]'s convention of the “wicked rich” and the “pious poor” and adopting its voice, James indicts the rich with the sins of hoarding wealth, fraudulently withholding wages, corruption,  pride, luxury, covetousness and murder; and denounces the folly of their actions in the face of the imminent [[Day of Judgement]].

===Revelation===
Finally, the Revelation treats earthly riches and commercial activities with great ambivalence. While Jesus exposes the true poverty of the Laodicean church’s boast of wealth (3.17–18), he presents himself as the true source and dispenser of wealth (cf. 2 Cor. 8.13–15). Later, earthly riches and businesses activities are associated with the sins of Babylon, the earthly power of evil with self-accorded glory and luxury, whose fall is imminent (18.1–24). However, the Revelations also portrays the New Jerusalem with a lavish materialistic description, made of pure gold decorated with “every kind of precious stone” (21.18–19).

==Early Christianity==
[[File:Vespiolla Apostoli 3.jpg|thumb|240px|15th-century fresco of the Apostles, [[Turin]], Italy]]
Early Christianity appears to have adopted many of the ethical themes found in the Hebrew Bible.  However, the teachings of Jesus and his apostles as presented in the New Testament exhibit an "acute sensitivity to the needs of the disadvantaged" that Frederick sees as "adding a critical edge to Christian teaching where wealth and the pursuit of economic gain are concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A companion to business ethics |first=Robert |last=Frederick |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2002 |pages=292–93 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PDXVnfyKHBIC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+business#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20business&amp;f=false|isbn=9781405101028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Kahan points to the fact that Jesus was a poor man as emblematic of "a revolution in the way poverty and wealth were viewed."&lt;ref name=Kahan44&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S. |last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=44|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not to say that Christian attitudes borrowed nothing from its Greco-Roman and Jewish precursors.  Kahan acknowledges that, "Christian theology absorbed those Greco-Roman attitudes towards money that complemented its own."  However, as Kahan puts it, "Never before had any god been conceived of as poor."&lt;ref name=Kahan44 /&gt;  He characterizes Christian charity as being "different in kind from the generosity praised in the classical tradition."&lt;ref name=Kahan42&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S.|last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahan contrasts the attitudes of early Christians with those of classical thinkers such as Seneca.  The New Testament urges Christians to sell material possessions and give the money to the poor.  According to Kahan, the goal of Christian charity is equality, a notion which is absent in the Greco-Roman attitudes toward the poor.&lt;ref name=Kahan42/&gt;

Cosimo Perrotta characterizes the Christian attitude vis-a-vis poverty and work as being "much closer to the tradition of the Old Testament than to classical culture."&lt;ref name=Perrotta43 /&gt;  However, [[Irving Kristol]] suggests that Christianity's attitude towards wealth is markedly different from that of the Hebrews in the Old Testament.  Kristol asserts that traditional Judaism has no precepts that parallel the Christian assertion that it is difficult for a rich man to get into heaven.&lt;ref name=Kristol437&gt;{{cite book |title=Neoconservatism: the autobiography of an idea |first=Irving |last=Kristol |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1995 |page=437 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=S2nUuTagIw8C&amp;pg=PA437&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780028740218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perrotta characterizes Christianity as not disdaining material wealth as did classical thinkers such as [[Socrates]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|the Cynics]] and Seneca and yet not desiring it as the Old Testament writers did.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44 /&gt;

==Patristic era==

Many of the [[Church Fathers]] condemned private property and advocated the communal ownership of property as an ideal for Christians to follow.  However, they recognized early on that this was an ideal which was not practical in everyday life and viewed private property as a "necessary evil resulting from the fall of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Outlines of economics |first1=Richard Theodore |last1=Ely |first2=Thomas Sewall |last2=Adams |first3=Max Otto |last3=Lorenz |first4=Allyn Abbott |last4=Young |publisher=Macmillan |year=1920 |page=743 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TiYuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA743&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
American theologian [[Robert M. Grant (theologian)|Robert Grant]] noted that, while almost all of the Church Fathers condemn the "love of money for its own sake and insist upon the positive duty of almsgiving", none of them seems to have advocated the general application of Jesus' counsel to the rich young man viz. to give away all of his worldly possessions in order to follow him.&lt;ref name=Grant49&gt;{{cite book |title=Augustus to Constantine: the rise and triumph of Christianity in the Roman world |first=Robert McQueen |last=Grant |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2004 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=d_vxEB7nT_QC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20fathers%20attitudes%20money%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9780664227722 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] urged Christians to turn away from the desire for material wealth and success.  He argued that the accumulation of wealth was not a worthy goal for Christians.

[[Clement of Alexandria]] counselled that property be used for the good of the community, he sanctioned private ownership of property and the accumulation of wealth.&lt;ref name=Rothbard&gt;{{cite book |title=An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |year=2006 |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MCcWhLmRo-cC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781610164771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lactantius]] wrote that "the ownership of property contains the material of both vices and virtues but communism [communitas] contains nothing but license for vice."&lt;ref name=Grant49 /&gt;

==Medieval Europe==
{{further|Apostolic poverty}}
By the beginning of the medieval era, the Christian paternalist ethic was "thoroughly entrenched in the culture of Western Europe."  Individualist and materialist pursuits such as greed, avarice, and the accumulation of wealth were condemned as un-Christian.&lt;ref name=Hunt10&gt;{{cite book |title=Property and Prophets: The Evolution of Economic Institutions and Ideologies  |first=E.

Madeleine Gray describes the medieval system of social welfare as one that was "organized through the church and underpinned by ideas on the spiritual value of poverty.&lt;ref name=Gray119&gt;{{cite book |title=The Protestant Reformation: belief, practice, and tradition |first=Madeleine |last=Gray |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |year=2003 |page=119 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z1qRnlLwWsgC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Protestant+Reformation+money+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781903900116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kahan, Christian theologians regularly condemned merchants.  For example, he cites [[Honorius of Autun]] who wrote that merchants had little chance of going to heaven whereas farmers were likely to be saved.  He further cites [[Gratian]] who wrote that "the man who buys something in order that he may gain by selling it again unchanged and as he bought it, that man is of the buyers and sellers who are cast forth from God's temple."&lt;ref name=Kahan46&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S.|last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the medieval era saw a change in the attitudes of Christians towards the accumulation of wealth.  [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined avarice not simply as a desire for wealth but as an ''immoderate'' desire for wealth.  Aquinas wrote that it was acceptable to have "external riches" to the extent that they were necessary for him to maintain his "condition of life".  This argued that the nobility had a right to more wealth than the peasantry.  What was unacceptable was for a person to seek to more wealth than was appropriate to one's station or aspire to a higher station in life.&lt;ref name=Kahan44 /&gt; The period saw fierce debates on [[Absolute Poverty of Christ|whether Christ owned property]].

The church evolved into the single most powerful institution in medieval Europe, more powerful than any single potentate.  The Church was so wealthy that, at one time, it owned as much as 20–30% of the land in Western Europe in an era when land was the primary form of wealth.  Over time, this wealth and power led to abuses and corruption.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Monasticism===
As early as the 6th and 7th centuries, the issue of property and move of wealth in the event of outside aggression had been addressed in monastic communities via agreements such as the [[Consensoria Monachorum]].&lt;ref name=Bishko &gt;Charles J. Bishko, "The Date and Nature of the Spanish Consensoria Monachorum", ''The American Journal of Philology'' Vol. 69, No. 4, 1948 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/290910] also at [http://libro.uca.edu/monastic/monastic2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= power &gt;''Topographies of power in the early Middle Ages'' by Frans Theuws, Mayke De Jong, Carine van Rhijn 2001 {{ISBN|90-04-11734-2}} p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; By the eleventh century, [[Benedictine]] monasteries had become wealthy, owing to the generous donations of monarchs and nobility.  Abbots of the larger monasteries achieved international prominence.  In reaction to this wealth and power, a reform movement arose which sought a simpler, more austere monastic life in which monks worked with their hands rather than acting as landlords over serfs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval panorama |first=Robert |last=Bartlett |publisher=Getty Publications |year=2001 |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DjI5t3DE00wC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=monastic+communities+Christian+medieval#v=onepage&amp;q=monastic%20communities%20Christian%20medieval&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 13th century, [[mendicant orders]] such as the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscans]] departed from the practice of existing religious orders by taking vows of extreme poverty and maintaining an active presence preaching and serving the community rather than withdrawing into monasteries. [[Francis of Assisi]] viewed poverty as a key element of the [[imitation of Christ]] who was "poor at birth in the manger, poor as he lived in the world, and naked as he died on the cross".&lt;ref name= Miles160 &gt;''The Word made flesh: a history of Christian thought'' by Margaret Ruth Miles 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0846-1}} pp. 160–61&lt;/ref&gt;

The visible public commitment of the Franciscans to poverty provided to the laity a sharp contrast to the wealth and power of the Church, provoking "awkward questions".&lt;ref name="Placher1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Carl Placher|author-link=William Placher |title=Readings in the History of Christian Theology: From its beginnings to the eve of the Reformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rya0v9bgwT8C&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=11 October 2011|date=15 April 1988|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-24057-8|pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usury===
{{main|Usury}}

[[File:UsuryDurer.jpg|right |thumb |Of Usury, from [[Sebastian Brant|Brant's]] ''Stultifera Navis'' ([[Narrenschiff|the Ship of Fools]]); [[woodcut]] attributed to [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]

[[Usury]] originally was the charging of [[interest]] on [[loan]]s; this included charging a fee for the use of money, such as at a [[bureau de change]]. In places where interest became acceptable, usury was interest above the rate allowed by law.  Today, usury commonly is the charging of unreasonable or relatively high rates of interest.

The first of the scholastics, [[Saint Anselm of Canterbury]], led the shift in thought that labeled charging interest the same as theft. Previously usury had been seen as a lack of charity.

St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], the leading theologian of the Catholic Church, argued charging of interest is wrong because it amounts to "double charging", charging for both the thing and the use of the thing.

This did not, as some think, prevent investment. What it stipulated was that in order for the investor to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short he must be a joint-venturer. Simply to invest the money and expect it to be returned regardless of the success of the venture was to make money simply by having money and not by taking any risk or by doing any work or by any effort or sacrifice at all. This is usury. St Thomas quotes Aristotle as saying that "to live by usury is exceedingly unnatural". St Thomas allows, however, charges for actual services provided. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out e.g. any fair administrative charges.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Reformation==

The rising capitalistic middle class resented the drain of their wealth to the church; in northern Europe, they supported local reformers against the corruption, rapacity and venality which they viewed as originating in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of commerce and industry |first=Cheesman Abiah|last=Herrick |publisher=Macmillan Co. |year=1917 |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BHVMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=medieval+Europe+Christian+church+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=medieval%20Europe%20Christian%20church%20wealth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calvinism===

One school of thought attributes [[Calvinism]] with setting the stage for the later development of [[capitalism]] in northern Europe. In this view, elements of Calvinism represented a revolt against the medieval condemnation of [[usury]] and, implicitly, of profit in general.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Such a connection was advanced in influential works by [[R. H. Tawney]](1880–1962) and by [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920).

Calvin criticized the use of certain passages of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others of them had been rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of [[Aristotle]]) that it is wrong to charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin's position is expressed in a letter to a friend quoted in {{cite book |last = Le Van Baumer | first = Franklin, editor | title = Main Currents of Western Thought: Readings in Western Europe Intellectual History from the Middle Ages to the Present | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven |year = 1978 | isbn = 0-300-02233-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puritanism==

For [[Puritan]]s, work was not simply arduous drudgery required to sustain life.  Joseph Conforti describes the Puritan attitude toward work as taking on "the character of a vocation — a calling through which one improved the world, redeemed time, glorified God, and followed life's pilgrimage toward salvation."&lt;ref name=Conforti42&gt;{{cite book |title=Saints and strangers: New England in British North America |first=Joseph A. |last=Conforti |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zsO6_qJ0s9UC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Puritan+%22Stewardship+of+wealth%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Puritan%20%22Stewardship%20of%20wealth%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780801882531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gayraud Wilmore characterizes the Puritan social ethic as focused on the "acquisition and proper stewardship of wealth as outward symbols of God's favor and the consequent salvation of the individual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=African American religious studies: an interdisciplinary anthology |first=Gayraud S. |last=Wilmore |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1989  |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-9vTPu5Z6QC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Puritan+%22Stewardship+of+wealth%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Puritan%20%22Stewardship%20of%20wealth%22&amp;f=false|isbn=0822309262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Puritans were urged to be producers rather than consumers and to invest their profits to create more jobs for industrious workers who would thus be enabled to "contribute to a productive society and a vital, expansive church."  Puritans were counseled to seek sufficient comfort and economic self-sufficiency but to avoid the pursuit of luxuries or the accumulation of material wealth for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Conforti42 /&gt;

==The rise of capitalism==

In two journal articles published in 1904–05, German sociologist [[Max Weber]] propounded a thesis that Reformed (i.e., Calvinist) Protestantism had engendered the character traits and values that under-girded modern capitalism. The English translation of these articles were published in book form in 1930 as ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. Weber argued that [[capitalism]] in northern Europe evolved because the [[Protestant]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) [[Protestant work ethic|ethic]] influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own [[Organization|enterprises]] and engaging in [[trade]] and the accumulation of [[wealth]] for investment. In other words, the [[Protestant work ethic]] was a force behind an unplanned and uncoordinated [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]] that influenced the development of [[capitalism]].

Weber's work focused scholars on the question of the uniqueness of Western civilization and the nature of its economic and social development.  Scholars have sought to explain the fact that economic growth has been much more rapid in Northern and Western Europe and its overseas offshoots than in other parts of the world including those that where the Catholic and Orthodox churches have been dominant over Protestantism.  Some have observed that explosive economic growth occurred at roughly the same time, or soon after, these areas experienced the rise of Protestant religions.  Stanley Engerman asserts that, although some scholars may argue that the two phenomena are unrelated, many would find it difficult to accept such a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism |url=http://eh.net/node/2724 |first=Stanley L. |last=Engerman |date=2000-02-29 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Chamberlain wrote that "Christianity tends to lead to a capitalistic mode of life whenever siege conditions do not prevail... [capitalism] is not Christian in and by itself; it is merely to say that capitalism is a material by-product of the Mosaic Law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Roots of Capitalism |first=John |last=Chamberlain |year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rodney Stark]] propounds the theory that Christian rationality is the primary driver behind the success of capitalism and the Rise of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success|first=Rodney|last=Stark|location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=2005 |isbn=1-4000-6228-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q9j6OoeWqK4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Christianity+capitalism#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John B. Cobb]] argues that the "economism that rules the West and through it much of the East" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that "man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)". He asserts that it is obvious that "Western society is organized in the service of wealth" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West.&lt;ref name="Cobb, Jr"/&gt;

==Social justice==
{{main|Social justice}}

[[File:Thomas Aquinas in Stained Glass crop.jpg|thumb|right|Much of Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s theology dealt with issues of social justice.]]
[[Social justice]] generally refers to the idea of creating a society or institution that is based on the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and solidarity, that understands and values [[human rights]], and that recognizes the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name="EducationSocialJustice"&gt;{{cite book |title=Education and Social Justice |first1=Joseph I. |last1=Zajda |first2=S. |last2=Majhanovich |first3=V. |last3=Rust |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |isbn=1-4020-4721-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iCZH-x9FTWoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=education+and+social+justice+zajda#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NursingEthics"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nursing ethics: across the curriculum and into practice |first1=Janie B. |last1=Butts |first2=Karen |last2=Rich |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7637-4735-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DmUBBCVjW_gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Nursing+ethics%22+Butts+Rich+Jones#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nursing%20ethics%22%20Butts%20Rich%20Jones&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term and modern concept of "social justice" was coined by the [[Jesuit]] [[Luigi Taparelli]] in 1840 based on the teachings of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] and given further exposure in 1848 by [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati]].&lt;ref name="EducationSocialJustice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NursingEthics"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Battleground criminal justice by Gregg Barak, Greenwood publishing group 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-313-34040-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engineering and Social Justice By Donna Riley, Morgan and Claypool Publishers 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-59829-626-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spirituality, social justice, and language learning By David I.

Ryan]], who initiated the concept of a [[living wage]]. [[Father Coughlin]] also used the term in his publications in the 1930s and the 1940s. It is a part of [[Catholic social teaching]], [[Social Gospel]] from Episcopalians and is one of the [[Four Pillars of the Green Party]] upheld by [[Global Greens|green parties worldwide]]. Social justice as a secular concept, distinct from religious teachings, emerged mainly in the late twentieth century, influenced primarily by philosopher [[John Rawls]]. Some tenets of social justice have been adopted by those on the [[leftist|left]] of the [[political spectrum]].

According to Kent Van Til, the view that wealth has been taken from the poor by the rich implies that the redistribution of that wealth is more a matter of restitution than of theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Poverty and Morality: Religious and Secular Perspectives |first1=William A. |last1=Galston |first2=Peter H. |last2=Hoffenberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010  |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VyzuGet8080C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Christianity+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9781139491068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic social teaching===
{{main|Catholic social teaching}}

[[Catholic social teaching]] is a body of doctrine developed by the [[Catholic Church]] on matters of [[poverty]] and [[wealth]], [[economics]], [[social organization]] and the role of the [[state (polity)|state]].  Its foundations are widely considered to have been laid by Pope Leo XIII's 1891 [[encyclical|encyclical letter]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', which advocated economic [[distributism]] and condemned [[socialism]].

According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]], its purpose "is simply to help purify reason and to contribute, here and now, to the acknowledgment and attainment of what is just…. [The Church] has to play her part through rational argument and she has to reawaken the spiritual energy without which justice…cannot prevail and prosper",&lt;ref&gt;(Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas Est, 28).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pope John Paul II]], its foundation "rests on the threefold cornerstones of human dignity, solidarity and subsidiarity".&lt;ref&gt;(John Paul II, 1999 Apostolic Exhortation, Ecclesia in America, 55).&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns echo elements of [[Jewish law]] and the prophetic books of the [[Old Testament]], and recall the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] recorded in the [[New Testament]], such as his declaration that "whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of Mine, you have done for Me."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25:40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic social teaching is distinctive in its consistent critiques of [[modernity|modern]] social and political ideologies both of the left and of the right: [[liberalism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', § 99 ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fascism]], and [[Nazism]] have all been condemned, at least in their pure forms, by several popes since the late nineteenth century.

===Marxism===

Irving Kristol posits that one reason that those who are "experiencing a Christian impulse, an impulse toward the ''imitatio Christi'', would lean toward socialism ... is the attitude of Christianity toward the poor. "&lt;ref name=Kristol437 /&gt;

[[Arnold Toynbee]] characterized Communist ideology as a "Christian heresy" in the sense that it focused on a few elements of the faith to the exclusion of the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Study of History|first=Arnold |last=Toynbee |year=1961 |page=545 |quote=The Communist ideology was a Christian heresy in the sense that it had singled out several elements in Christianity and had concentrated on these to the exclusion of the rest.  It had taken from Christianity its social ideals, its intolerance and its fervour.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Donald Treadgold interprets Toynbee's characterization as applying to Christian attitudes as opposed to Christian doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The West in Russia and China: Russia, 1472–1917 |first=Donald W. |last=Treadgold |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1973 |page=256|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fg04AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA256&amp;lpg=PA256&amp;dq=%22Arnold+Toynbee%22+Communism+Christian+heresy#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Arnold%20Toynbee%22%20Communism%20Christian%20heresy&amp;f=false|isbn=9780521097253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, "Moral Philosophy", [[Jacques Maritain]] echoed Toynbee's perspective, characterizing the teachings of [[Karl Marx]] as a "Christian heresy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Moral Philosophy |first=Jacques |last=Maritain |quote=This is to say that Marx is a heretic of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and that Marxism is a 'Christian heresy', the latest Christian heresy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After reading Maritain, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] commented that Marxism had arisen in response to "a Christian world unfaithful to its own principles."  Although King criticized the Soviet Marxist–Leninist Communist regime sharply, he nonetheless commented that Marx's devotion to a classless society made him almost Christian. Tragically, said King, Communist regimes created "new classes and a new lexicon of injustice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=From civil rights to human rights: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the struggle for economic justice |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2007 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8k6btUYR68C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Martin+Luther+King+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Martin%20Luther%20King%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian socialism===
{{main|Christian socialism}}

[[Christian socialism]] generally refers to those on the [[Christian left]] whose politics are both [[Christian]] and [[socialist]] and who see these two philosophies as being interrelated. This category can include [[Liberation theology]] and the doctrine of the [[social gospel]].

The ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' [[encyclical]] of [[Leo XIII]] (1891) was the starting point of a [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic doctrine]] on social questions that has been expanded and updated over the course of the 20th century. Despite the introduction of social thought as an object of religious thought, ''Rerum novarum'' explicitly rejects what it calls "the main tenet of socialism":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Hence, it is clear that the main tenet of socialism, community of goods, must be utterly rejected, since it only injures those whom it would seem meant to benefit, is directly contrary to the natural rights of mankind, and would introduce confusion and disorder into the commonwealth. The first and most fundamental principle, therefore, if one would undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses, must be the inviolability of private property." ''Rerum novarum'', paragraph 16.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The encyclical promotes a kind of [[corporatism]] based on [[social solidarity]] among the classes with respects for the needs and rights of all.

In the November 1914 issue of ''The Christian Socialist'', Episcopal bishop [[Franklin Spencer Spalding]] of Utah, U.S.A. stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Christian Church exists for the sole purpose of saving the human race. So far she has failed, but I think that Socialism shows her how she may succeed. It insists that men cannot be made right until the material conditions be made right. Although man cannot live by bread alone, he must have bread. Therefore the Church must destroy a system of society which inevitably creates and perpetuates unequal and unfair conditions of life. These unequal and unfair conditions have been created by competition. Therefore competition must cease and cooperation take its place."&lt;ref name="D.Berman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=David|title=Radicalism in the Mountain West 1890–1920|year=2007|publisher=University Press of Colorado|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the explicit rejection of Socialism, in the more Catholic countries of [[Europe]] the encyclical's teaching was the inspiration that led to the formation of new [[Christian democracy|Christian-inspired Socialist parties]].  A number of Christian socialist movements and political parties throughout the world group themselves into the [[International League of Religious Socialists]]. It has member organizations in 21 countries representing 200,000 members.

Christian socialists draw parallels between what some have characterized as the [[egalitarian]] and anti-establishment message of [[Jesus]], who–according to the [[Gospel]]–spoke against the religious authorities of his time, and the egalitarian, anti-establishment, and sometimes [[anti-clerical]] message of most contemporary socialisms. Some Christian Socialists have become active [[Communism|Communists]]. This phenomenon was most common among [[missionary|missionaries]] in [[China]], the most notable being [[James Gareth Endicott]], who became supportive of the struggle of the [[Communist Party of China]] in the 1930s and 1940s.

[[Michael Moore]]'s film [[Capitalism: A Love Story]] also features a religious component where Moore examines whether or not capitalism is a [[sin]] and whether [[Jesus]] would be a capitalist,&lt;ref name="ChurchMoore"&gt;{{cite news| last=Moore|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Moore|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-moore/for-those-of-you-on-your_b_308948.html|title=For Those of You on Your Way to Church This Morning ...|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=October 4, 2009| accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to shine light on the ideological contradictions among [[Christian right#History|evangelical conservatives]] who support free market ideals.

===Liberation theology===
{{main|Liberation theology}}

[[Liberation theology]]&lt;ref&gt;In the mass media, 'Liberation Theology' can sometimes be used loosely, to refer to a wide variety of activist Christian thought. In this article the term will be used in the narrow sense outlined here.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Christian movement]] in [[political theology]] which interprets the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] in terms of a liberation from unjust economic, political, or social conditions. It has been described by proponents as "an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor's suffering, their struggle and hope, and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor",&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Berryman|Berryman, Phillip]], ''Liberation Theology: essential facts about the revolutionary movement in Latin America and beyond''(1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and by detractors as Christianized [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;"[David] Horowitz first describes liberation theology as 'a form of Marxised Christianity,' which has validity despite the awkward phrasing, but then he calls it a form of 'Marxist–Leninist ideology,' which is simply not true for most liberation theology..." Robert Shaffer, "[http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html Acceptable Bounds of Academic Discourse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904165644/http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html |date=2013-09-04 }}," Organization of American Historians Newsletter 35, November, 2007. URL retrieved 12 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement, it began as a movement within the [[Roman Catholic]] church in Latin America in the 1950s–1960s. Liberation theology arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by [[social injustice]] in that region. The term was coined in 1971 by the [[Peruvian]] priest [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], who wrote one of the movement's most famous books, ''A Theology of Liberation''. Other noted exponents are [[Leonardo Boff]] of Brazil, [[Jon Sobrino]] of El Salvador, and [[Juan Luis Segundo]] of Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McBrien,''Catholicism''(Harper Collins, 1994), chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Gutierrez,''A Theology of Liberation'', First (Spanish) edition published in Lima, Peru, 1971; first English edition published by Orbis Books (Maryknoll, New York), 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of liberation theology within the Catholic Church diminished after proponents using Marxist concepts were admonished by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] (CDF) in 1984 and 1986. The Vatican criticized certain strains of liberation theology – without actually identifying any particular strain – for focusing on institutional dimensions of sin to the exclusion of the individual; and for allegedly misidentifying the church hierarchy as members of the privileged class.&lt;ref name="Wojda, Paul J. 1995"&gt;Wojda, Paul J., "Liberation theology", in R.P. McBrien, ed., ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (Harper Collins, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Color rendering capacity''' is a measure of how well [[color]]s are represented under [[artificial light]]. It is one of several measures of [[color rendering index]],&lt;ref&gt;Commission International de l'Eclairage 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the extent to which a wide range of colors may be distinguished under a given [[light source]].&lt;ref&gt;MacAdam 1981, p.103.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Technical definition==
Associated with each type of [[spectral power distribution]], one and only one [[color space|color solid]] can be constructed in a uniform [[CIE 1931 color space|color space]].&lt;ref&gt;MacAdam 1981, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proved that this color solid comprises all the object colors producible under illumination of that spectral power distribution with one unit [[luminous flux]],&lt;ref&gt;MacAdam 1981, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; and the volume of the color solid determines the upper limit for the number of the object colors producible under the given spectral power distribution with one unit luminous flux.&lt;ref&gt;Xu 2010, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This volume of the color solid associated with the spectral power distribution is called the color rendering capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Xu 2010, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be expressed as a proportion of the volume of the color solid associated with the [[Standard illuminant#Illuminant E|equal energy spectrum]], and is output in this form from computer software known as "CRC99".

==Sample values==
The color rendering capacity is 0.35 for [[sodium-vapor lamp|high-pressure sodium lamps]], 0.97 for "Deluxe" [[fluorescent lamp]]s, and 1.00 for equal energy spectrum respectively. These results conform with everyday experience: high pressure sodium lamps are rarely used in stores for commodity lighting, as the commodities would appear in monotonous yellow shades while the same commodities under deluxe fluorescent, at the same light level, display a much wider variety of colors. The [[CIELUV|color solid]] and the color rendering capacity calculated for the spectrum of the Deluxe fluorescent lamp F7 is shown on the right.[[File:Color Rendering Capacity of F7.png|thumb|The color solid and the color rendering capacity associated with the spectral power distribution of the Deluxe fluorescent lamps]]

The '''culture of [[Nepal]]''' is intertwined with the culture of the broader [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Tibet]]. The [[cultural heritage]] of [[Nepal]] has evolved over the centuries. This multi-dimensional heritage bounds the diversities of Nepal's [[ethnic]], [[tribal]], and [[social groups]], and it expresses in [[music]] and [[dance]]; [[art]] and [[craft]]; [[folklore]] and [[Folklore|folktales]]; [[languages]] and [[literature]]; [[philosophy]] and [[religion]]; [[festivals]] and [[Party|celebration]]; [[foods]] and [[drinks]]. Its culture is mostly influenced by [[Indian culture]] and [[Tibetan culture]].

==Dance and music==
[[File:Nepali culture.JPG|thumb|Nepali traditional Pahadi dress used for dance]]
[[Legend]]s state that [[dances]] in this country originated in the abode of Lord Shiva — the [[Himalayas]], where he performed the [[tandava]] dance. This indicates that dance traditions of Nepal are very ancient and unique. With altitudes and ethnicity, the dances of Nepal slightly change in style as well as in the [[costumes]]. The Dishka, a dance performed at weddings, includes intricate footwork and arm movements. Accompanying music and musical instruments change in tune with the themes, which revolve around topics like harvesting of crops, marriage rites, war stories, a lonely girl’s yearning for her love, and several other themes and stories from everyday life in the villages. The famous Tharu stick dances, and the crazy peacock dance are two highlights, but there are plenty of other surprises. Expect to be invited to join in the dancing, as the evening reaches its climax.

==Languages==
As per the 2011 census, 123 languages are spoken in Nepal. Nepal's linguistic heritage has evolved from three major language groups: [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Tibeto-Burman]], and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]]. The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as mother tongue) are [[Nepali language|Nepali]] (44.6%), [[Maithili language|Maithili]] (11.7%), [[Bhojpuri]](6%), [[Tharu language|Tharu]] (5.8%), [[Tamang]] (5.1%), [[Nepal Bhasa (language)|Nepal Bhasa]] (3.2%), [[Magar language|Magar]] (3%) and [[Bajjika]] (3%) [[Kirat]]-[[Sunuwar]], [[Limbu]], [[Rai languages|Rai]], [[Gurung]], .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |url=http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Major-Finding.pdf |title=Major highlights |work= |publisher=Central Bureau of Statistics |year=2013 |page=4 |accessdate=1 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717170017/http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Major-Finding.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nepali language|Nepali]], written in [[Devanagari]] script, is the official national language and serves as ''lingua franca'' among Nepalese ethno-linguistic groups. Extinct languages of Nepal include [[Kusunda language|Kusunda]], MaWalinga and [[Waling]]

'''Religions and philosophy of Nepal'''

[[File:A Buddhist Monastery Nepal.jpg|thumb|175px|right|A [[Buddhist monastery]] in southern Nepal.]]
The 2001 [[census]] identified 80.6% of the population being [[Hinduism|Hindu]]. [[Buddhism]] was practiced by about 11% of the population (although many people labelled Hindu or Buddhist often practice a syncretic blend of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and/or [[animist]] traditions). About 3.2% practice [[Islam]] and 3.6% of the population follows the indigenous [[Kirant]] religion. [[Christianity]] is practiced officially by less than 0.5%.

Hindu and Buddhist traditions in Nepal go back more than two [[millennia]]. In [[Lumbini]], Buddha was born, and [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath temple]], Kathmandu, is an old and famous [[Shiva|Shiva temple]] of Hindus. Nepal has several other [[temples]] and Buddhist [[monasteries]], as well as places of worship of other religious groups. Traditionally, Nepalese [[Philosophy|philosophical]] thoughts are ingrained with the Hindu and Buddhist philosophical ethos and traditions, which include elements of [[Shaivaites|Kashmir Shaivism]], Nyingma school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], works of Karmacharyas of Bhaktapur, and tantric traditions. [[Tantra|Tantric]] traditions are deep rooted in Nepal, including the practice of animal sacrifices. Five types of animals, always male, are considered acceptable for sacrifice: [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]], [[goats]], [[sheep]], [[chickens]], and [[ducks]]. Cows are very sacred animals and are never considered acceptable for sacrifice.

==Festivals and celebrations==
[[File:Dashai.jpg|thumb|Senior offering ''Dashain Tika'' to junior]]
[[File:Messe-09.JPG|thumb|right|Costumed Hindu girls of Kathmandu during festival time in Nepal]]
Several of the [[List of festivals in Nepal|festivals of Nepal]] last from one to several days. As a predominantly Hindu and Buddhist nation, most of the Nepalese festivals are religious ones. The festivals of Nepal have their roots in [[Hinduism]] as 82% of the population of the country is Hindu. [[Buddhism]], the second-largest religion of the nation which accounts for 9% of the population, has influenced the cultural festivals of Nepal. [[Dashain]] or [[Dusshera]] is the longest and the most important festival of Nepal. Generally Dashain falls in late September to mid-October, right after the end of the [[Monsoon|monsoon season]]. It is "a day of Victory over Demons". The [[Newar]]s celebrate the festival as [[Mohani]]. [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] or [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], [[Saraswati Puja]], [[Rakshabandhan]], [[Bhai Dooj]], [[Janmashtami]], [[Kali Puja]], Gai Jatra, Nag Panchami, [[Teej]], [[Chhath]], [[Kartik Poornima]], [[Maghe Sankranti]], [[Ganesh Chaturthi]], [[Maha Shivratri]] and [[Chhechu]] are other widely celebrated important festivals of Nepal. New Year's Day of the lunar calendar [[Nepal Sambat]] occurs in November. Several Jatras take place throughout the year and public holidays are declared in some regions.

Other important festivals include [[Buddha Purnima]] (the celebration of the birth of Buddha)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL= http://www.weallnepali.com/nepali-festivals/buddha-purnima|title=Buddha jayanti|publisher=Weallnepali|accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shivaratri|Maha Shivaratri]] (a festival of [[Shive|Lord Shiva]]) and during [[Maha Shivaratri]] festivities, some people consume excessive [[drinks]]  and smoke [[charas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.weallnepali.com/nepali-festivals/maha-shivaratri|title=Mahashivaratri|publisher=weallnepali|accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]], mostly located at higher altitudes and in the [[Mount Everest]] region, celebrate ''Mani Rimdu'', for ''the good of the world''.

Most festivals include dancing and music, and a variety of special foods are consumed during festivals and on special occasions.

The [[Sagan (ceremony)|Sagan ceremony]] is the ritualized presentation of five food items (boiled egg, smoked fish, meat, lentil cake and rice wine) to a person which is done to bring good fortune as per [[Tantra|Tantric]] tradition.

'''''Drum''''' is a 1976 American film based on the [[Kyle Onstott]] novel of the same name.&lt;ref name="Onstott1962"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kyle Onstott|title=Drum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9x1bAAAAMAAJ|year=1962|publisher=Dial Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released by [[United Artists]] and is a sequel to the film ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]'', released in 1975. The film stars [[Warren Oates]], [[Pam Grier]], [[Ken Norton]], and was directed by [[Steve Carver]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Synopsis==
This film picks up the story 15 years after the events of the first film. Drum (Norton) has been born to a white prostitute (Vega), who raises him with her black lesbian lover (Kelly). Drum grows up to be a fighter and is often forced to bare-knuckle-box other slaves for the entertainment of the owners, one of whom is a gay Frenchman named Bernard DeMarigny (Colicos). DeMarigny wants to sleep with Drum, but his advances are rejected by the slave and DeMarigny vows revenge against Drum. Drum and his friend Blaise (Kotto) are eventually sold to plantation owner Hammond Maxwell (Oates) and are both taken to his plantation to work. Regine (Grier) is purchased by Maxwell as well and is taken to the plantation for his own personal desires as a bedwench.

After arriving at Maxwell's plantation, Regine is set up in the bedroom above Hammond. Augusta Chauvel (Lewis), Maxwell's fiancé is jealous and has other plans for Regine. Maxwell's daughter Sophie (Smith) wants to sleep with Drum, but he won't for fear of being killed. Sophie also attempts to sleep with Blaise and after being rejected, tells her father that Blaise has raped her, which is a lie. Blaise is put in chains and Maxwell decides that he must be castrated for the alleged rape.

Meanwhile, a dinner party has been arranged to celebrate the engagement of Maxwell and Chauvel. DeMarigny has been invited to attend the celebration and the guests end up discussing the best way to castrate a slave at the dinner party. While the party is taking place, Drum frees Blaise from his chains and there ends up being a violent uprising from the slaves at the engagement party. DeMarigny shoots Blaise during the fighting and Drum in turn grabs hold of DeMarigny's privates and rips them off. Both slaves and slavers are killed during the battle, but Maxwell and Chauvel are all saved by Drum. In appreciation for saving his family, Maxwell sets Drum free and sends him running into the night, which is the final scene of the movie, Drum running away into the unknown.

==Production==
The film was initially being directed by [[Burt Kennedy]], but he was replaced due to creative differences with the executive producer, [[Dino De Laurentiis]]. Carver then took over as director with only four days of preparation, the film's print made use of material filmed by both Kennedy and Carver.&lt;ref name="Compo2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Compo|title=Warren Oates: A Wild Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqICrZHA6CIC&amp;pg=PT351|date=April 17, 2009|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-7332-9|pages=351–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Vincent Canby of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: "Life on the old plantation was horrendous, I agree, but movies like this are less interested in information than titillation, which, in turn, reflects contemporary obsessions rather more than historical truths."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Vincent Canby|author=Canby, Vincent|title=Drum (1976)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F05EEDA153FE334BC4950DFB166838D669EDE|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 31, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edgelands''' are the transitional, [[Liminality|liminal]] areas of space to be found on the boundaries of country and town - with the spread of [[urbanisation]], an increasingly important facet of the twenty-first century world.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Walker - 2002 Aspects of Lincoln: Discovering Local History - Page 134 1473836131 "AN 'EDGE-LAND': THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WITHAM VALLEY EAST OF CANWICK ROAD by Dennis Mills THE TERM 'EDGE-LAND' has been coined recently for the concept of a neglected area on the fringe of a city. Frequently such ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of Edgelands was introduced by [[Marion Shoard]] in 2002, to cover the disorganised but often fertile hinterland between planned town and over-managed country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/our-beautiful-edgelands-a-dark-light-on-the-edge-of-town-2217071.html Our beautiful edgelands]&lt;/ref&gt;  However a century and a half earlier, [[Victor Hugo]] had already highlighted the existence of what he called "bastard countryside...ugly but bizarre, made up of two different natures, which surrounds certain great cities";&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Robert Macfarlane (writer)|Robert Macfarlane]], ''Landmarks'' (2015) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Richard Jeffries]] similarly explored the London edgeland in ''Nature near London'' (1883).
[[Alice Coleman]] (Kings College London, dept geography) in 2nd Land Use Survey of Great Britain, refers to  "rurban fringe". Indicating a similar landscape but with negative overtones.

Nevertheless it was only in the last decades of the twentieth century - as a distinct realm of Nature increasingly disappeared beneath the commodifying impact of globalising [[late capitalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Jameson]], ''The Jameson Reader'' (2002) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; - that the significance of the unstructured borderlands between organised town and organised country, part man-made, part natural,&lt;ref&gt;M. Pratt, ''My Wild Northumbria'' (2015) p. 176 and 208&lt;/ref&gt; both for wildlife and for human exploration, came into fuller focus. [[Psychogeography]] charted the London orbital, while bombsites, canal banks and brownfield sites were documented in poetry and prose, film and photography;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Macfarlane, ''Landmarks'' (2015) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and the borderlands as an untapped, transgressive resource became almost the object of a new cult.&lt;ref&gt;T. Fry, ''Design in the Borderlands'' (2014) p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnopoetics''' is a method of recording text versions of [[oral poetry]] or narrative performances (i.e. verbal lore) that uses poetic [[line (poetry)|lines]], [[verse (poetry)|verses]], and [[stanza]]s (instead of prose paragraphs) to capture the formal, poetic performance elements which would otherwise be lost in the written texts. The goal of any ethnopoetic text is to show how the techniques of unique oral performers enhance the aesthetic value of their performances within their specific cultural contexts. Major contributors to ethnopoetic theory include [[Jerome Rothenberg]], [[Dennis Tedlock]], and [[Dell Hymes]]. Ethnopoetics is considered  a subfield of [[ethnology]], [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], [[stylistics (field of study)|stylistics]], [[linguistics]], and [[Literary criticism|literature]] and translation studies.

==A need for ethnopoetics: Rothenberg==
Jerome Rothenberg  coined the term ethnopoetics in the 1960s. According to Catherine S. Quick, Rothenberg had recognized that “most translations of Native American oral traditions . . . failed to capture the power and beauty of the oral performances on the written page,” especially when “Western poetic styles” were imposed upon these written texts (1999, 96).&lt;ref name="Quick"&gt;Quick, Catherine. 1999. "Ethnopoetics." ''Folklore Forum'' 30(1/2): 95–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberg’s influence has increased public [[awareness]] of the rich narrative and poetic traditions of cultures all over the world.

==Ethnopoetic theory: Tedlock and Hymes==
The development of ethnopoetics as a separate subfield of study was largely pioneered from the middle of the 20th century by anthropologists and linguists such as Dennis Tedlock and Dell Hymes. Both Tedlock and Hymes used ethnopoetic analysis to do justice to the artistic richness of Native American verbal art, and while they have disagreed on some analytic details, they agree on the fundamental issues and purposes of ethnopoetics.

===Dennis Tedlock===
On the one hand, Dennis Tedlock argues not only that pauses in oral performances indicate where poetic line breaks should occur in the written texts, which he compares to musical scores,&lt;ref name="Quick"/&gt; but also that words on the page should be formatted to reflect the more subtle qualities of speech used in oral performances. Tedlock explain his perspective in this way,
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;An ethnopoetic score [or text] not only takes account of the words but silences, changes in loudness and tone of voice, the production of sound effects, and the use of gestures and props. . . . Ethnopoetics remains open to the creative side of performance, valuing features that may be rare or even unique to a particular artist or occasion.&lt;ref name="Tedlock"&gt;Tedlock, Dennis. Syllabus. “English 699: Ethnopoetics.” Colleges of Arts and Sciences. University at Buffalo. Accessed 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Tedlock argues that by visually representing oral performance features in the written texts, ethnopoetic methods more accurately convey the aesthetic qualities of the performance than uniformly formatted text in prose paragraphs ever could. Tedlock himself defines ethnopoetics as “a decentered poetics, an attempt to hear and read the poetries of distant others, outside the Western [poetic] tradition as we know it now."&lt;ref name="Tedlock"/&gt;

===Dell Hymes===
On the other hand, Dell Hymes believes that even previously dictated texts retain significant structural patterns of poetic repetition that “are the ‘reason why’” storytellers use pauses in their oral performances (1999, 97–98).&lt;ref name="Quick"/&gt; Hymes’s ethnopoetic theories focus on repetitions in the grammar and syntax of transcribed and translated texts that he suggest can still be analyzed and retranslated. For example, accordingly to folklorist [[Barre Toelken]], the poetic beauty and power of Native American texts like “The Sun's Myth” have been restored “because a dedicated anthropological folklorist and linguist, Dell Hymes, dedicated a good part of his life to resuscitating a dry, written text collected . . . by a long-dead anthropologist [i.e., Franz Boas] and stored away in a dusty volume” (2003, 122).&lt;ref name="Toelken"&gt;Toelken, Barre. 2003. The Anguish of Snails. Vol. 2, Folklife of the West, edited by [[Barre Toelken]] and William A. Wilson. Logan: Utah State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  When Hymes retranslated “The Sun’s Myth,” he recovered the poetic and stylistic devices that were used in the original recorded performance, but which had been lost in the myth’s earlier translation by [[Franz Boas]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hymes’ ethnopoetics revolves around a conception of narratives as primarily organized in terms of ''formal'' and ''aesthetic''—‘poetic’—patterns, not in terms of content or thematic patterns. Narrative is therefore to be seen as a form of action, of performance, and the meanings it generates are effects of performance. Narratives, seen from this perspective, are organized in lines and in groups of lines (verses, stanzas), and the organization of lines in narratives is a kind of implicit patterning that creates narrative effect. . . . Content, in other words, is an effect of the formal organization of a narrative: What there is to be told emerges out of how it is being told. (Blommaert 2007, 216)&lt;ref name="Blommaert"&gt;Blommaert, Jan. 2007. “Applied Ethnopoetics.” Narrative–State of the Art. Edited by Michael G. W. Bamberg. Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company. Benjamins Current Topics Series (Number: 595215). 215–224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, understanding the native language of oral performers is essential for accurate, ethnopoetic translation of their words into written texts. For example, folklorist Barre Toelken explains that Hymes’s “knowledge of the extant Chinookan languages” helped him to “notice stylistic devices that highlighted certain actions and themes and even performance styles that brought scenes into sharp focus” (2003, 122).&lt;ref name="Toelken"/&gt; In other words, without his knowledge of the native language of oral performers, Hymes could not have placed his ethnopoetic translation of “The Sun’s Myth” within its specific Native American cultural context.

==Ethnopoetics: aesthetic movement or academic discipline?==
Various other writers and poets can be said to have contributed to the field of ethnopoetics as an aesthetic movement. For example, Tristan Tzara created [[calligrams]] and [[William Bright]] worked with the Karuk tribe to preserve their native language. However, within the fields of [[linguistics]], [[folkloristics]], and [[anthropology]], ethnopoetics refers to a particular method of analyzing the linguistic features and syntactical structures of [[oral literature]] (such as poetry, myths, narratives, folk tales, ceremonial speeches, etc.) in ways that pay attention to poetic patterns within speech. Overall, then, ethnopoetic methods and theories strive to capture on the written page the unique aesthetic elements of individual cultures’ oral poetry and narrative performance traditions, or what folklorists would call their verbal lore.

== Editions and collections ==

=== Works and first publications in German ===

Only a few of Kafka's works were published during his lifetime: the story collections ''{{lang|de|[[Contemplation (Kafka)|Betrachtung]]}}'' (''Contemplation'') and ''{{lang|de|[[A Country Doctor (collection)|Ein Landarzt]]}}'' (''A Country Doctor''), and individual stories (such as "{{lang|de|[[The Metamorphosis|Die Verwandlung]]}}" ("The Metamorphosis")) in literary magazines. He prepared the story collection ''{{lang|de|[[A Hunger Artist (collection)|Ein Hungerkünstler]]}}'' (''A Hunger Artist'') for print, but it was not published until after his death. Kafka's unfinished works, including his novels ''{{lang|de|Der Process}}'', ''{{lang|de|Das Schloss}}'' and ''{{lang|de|[[Amerika (novel)|Amerika]]}}'' (also known as ''{{nowrap|{{lang|de|Der Verschollene}}}}'', ''The Man Who Disappeared''), were published posthumously, mostly by his friend [[Max Brod]], who ignored Kafka's wish to have the manuscripts destroyed. Brod also published letters, diaries and aphorisms.

Many of Kafka's works have uncertain dates of writing and/or were written over long periods of time. In such cases the year the writing of the work began is used. Year and place of the first publication is shown. For many works the German text is available, for several works also an English translation. It is linked in columns "de" (short for "deutsch", German) and "en" (short for English).

=== English translations ===

Kafka often made extensive use of a characteristic particular to the German language allowing for long sentences that sometimes can span an entire page. Kafka's sentences then deliver an unexpected impact just before the full stop—that being the finalizing meaning and focus. This is achieved due to the construction of certain sentences in German which require that the verb be positioned at the end of the sentence. Such constructions are difficult to duplicate in other languages, so it is up to the resourceful translator to provide the reader with the same (or at least equivalent) effect found in the original text.{{sfn|Kafka|1996|p=xi}} German's more flexible word order is not the only problem translating German into other languages. German also lacks an informal language register, uses modal connectives, and syntactic structures which can be translated in more than one way.{{sfn|Newmark|1991|pp=63–64}} Kafka did not write in standard High German, but rather in a Praguean German heavily influenced by the Yiddish and Czech languages.{{sfn|Deleuze|Guattari|1986|pp=22–25}} This has led philosophers Deleuze and Guattari to describe Kafka's linguistic style as "[[deterritorialized]]", characterized by a "withered vocabulary" and an "incorrect syntax".{{sfn|Deleuze|Guattari|1986|pp=22–25}}

German sentences also have a different [[syntax|syntactic structure]]. Unlike English, German is a verb-final language, which places the main verb of a verb string (e.g., "transformed" in "had been transformed") at the end of a phrase. The difference can be seen in the contrast between the original German version of the first sentence in Kafka's "The Metamorphosis":
[[File:Kafka 1'.png|English|thumb|center|600px|[[dependency grammar|Dependency tree]] illustrating the difference in syntax between the first sentence of Kafka's "The Metamorphosis" in translation by Ian Johnston and in the original German]]
{{clear}}

:''Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Traumen erwachte fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheuren Ungeziefer verwandelt''. (Original)
: As Gregor Samsa one morning from restless dreams awoke, found he himself in his bed into an enormous vermin transformed. (literal word for word translation){{sfn|Prinsky|2002}}{{sfn|Poulakis|2005}}

Another virtually insurmountable problem facing translators is how to deal with the author's intentional use of ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings which result in writings difficult to precisely translate.{{sfn|Lawson|1960|pp=216–219}}{{sfn|Rhine|1989|pp=447–458}} One such instance is found in the first sentence of [[The Metamorphosis#Lost in translation|"The Metamorphosis"]].{{sfn|Lawson|1960|pp=216–219}} English translators have often sought to render the word ''Ungeziefer'' as "insect"; &lt;!-- in Middle German, however, ''Ungeziefer'' literally means "unclean animal not suitable for sacrifice" --&gt; in today's German it means vermin. It is sometimes used colloquially to mean "bug"&amp;nbsp;– a very general term, unlike the scientific sounding "insect". Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing, but instead wanted to convey Gregor's disgust at his transformation.
Translators have chosen numerous inexact and unsatisfactory ways to represent "[zu einem] ungeheuren Ungeziefer", unable to convey the repetition of the first two syllables and the equal four syllables of the two words in German:
* "gigantic insect" (Muir, 1948)
* "monstrous vermin" (Corngold, 1972, Neugroschel, 1993/1995, Freed, 1996)
* "giant bug" (Underwood, 1981)
* "monstrous insect" (Pasley, 1992)
* "enormous bug" (Appelbaum, 1996)
* "monstrous cockroach" (Hofmann, 2007)

Another example is Kafka's use of the German noun ''[[wikt:Verkehr|Verkehr]]'' in the final sentence of ''The Judgment''. Literally, ''Verkehr'' means intercourse and, as in English, can have either a sexual or non-sexual meaning; in addition, it is used to mean transport or traffic. The sentence can be translated as: "At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge".{{sfn|Kafka|1996|p=75}} What gives added weight to the obvious double meaning of 'Verkehr' is Kafka's confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line, he was thinking of "a violent ejaculation".{{sfn|Brod|1960|p=129}}{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p=50}}

The '''Gaiety Theatre''' was a [[West End theatre]] in London, located on [[Aldwych]] at the eastern end of the [[Strand, London|Strand]].  The theatre was first established as the '''Strand Musick Hall''' (sic) in 1864 on the former site of the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]. In 1868, it became known as the Gaiety Theatre and was, at first, known for [[music hall]] and then for [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]], [[pantomime]] and [[operetta]] performances. From 1868 to the 1890s, it had a major influence on the development of modern [[musical theatre|musical comedy]].

Under the management of [[John Hollingshead]] until 1886, the theatre had early success with ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', by [[W. S. Gilbert]], followed by many other burlesques of operas and literary works.  Many of the productions starred [[Nellie Farren]]. Hollingshead's last production at the theatre was the burlesque ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885–86), produced together with his successor, [[George Edwardes]]. Edwardes's first show, ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'', became a long-running hit.  In the 1880s and 90s, the theatre had further success with a number of burlesques with original scores by the theatre's music director, [[Wilhelm Meyer Lutz]], including ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888), ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'' (1890) and ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891).

In the 1890s, the theatre introduced new style of musical theatre in London now referred to as the [[Edwardian musical comedy]].  These shows employed female dancers known as the [[Gaiety Girls]] and were extraordinarily popular, inspiring imitations at other London theatres.  A success in this genre was ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894), which was followed by many "girl"-themed musicals.  The building was demolished in 1903, and the theatre was rebuilt at the corner of Aldwych and The Strand.  More hit musicals followed.  When Edwardes died in 1915, [[Robert Evett]], took over the management of the theatre and had a number of further successes, notably ''[[Theodore &amp; Co]]'' (1916) and ''[[Going Up (musical)|Going Up]]'' (1918).  By 1939 and in need of refurbishment, the theatre closed and stood empty during [[World War II]]. The building suffered extensive bomb damage during [[airstrike|air raids]] and stood empty until it was demolished in 1956.

==Beginnings==
The theatre was financed by a [[joint stock company]] and built in 1864 as the Strand [[Music Hall|Musick Hall]] by Bassett and Keeling.  This large theatre, with over 2,000&amp;nbsp;seats,&lt;ref name=opening&gt;&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Strandmusikhall/Opening.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (early history of the Gaiety)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013065457/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Strandmusikhall/Opening.htm |date=13 October 2006 }} accessed 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; was built at a time when many new theatres were being built in London.&lt;ref name=times&gt;&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Strandmusikhall/Times.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) ''The Times'' 11 December 1868] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013065503/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Strandmusikhall/Times.htm |date=13 October 2006 }} accessed 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike at many other music halls, the proprietors decided to ban smoking and drinking within the hall, and these activities were accommodated in the adjacent saloons.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

A novel gas lighting system was incorporated in the hall, using prisms and mirrors to create a soft light.  Exhausting the heat of the gas jets drew fresh air into the building.  The house was approached through an ambitious arcade, from the Strand.  This was never successful and, with the theatre, was demolished to allow the building of the [[Aldwych]].

==Hollingshead years==
[[File:Gaiety-interior-1868.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the Gaiety, 1869]]
In 1868, the theatre was sumptuously rebuilt by [[John Hollingshead]] as the Gaiety Theatre (announcing its dramatic policy in its name), on a nearby prominent site at the centre of the Aldwych, facing the eastern end of the Strand.&lt;ref&gt;"Architecture: A city in flux brought to book", ''The Times'', 11 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by the theatre architect [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]], who also designed the [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatre]] (1871) in [[Dublin]].  A restaurant operated in the building, and patrons could eat before seeing the show and then go directly to their seats without having to worry about the weather outside.

The Gaiety Theatre opened on 21 December 1868, with ''On the Cards'' and several companion pieces, including the successful ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', by [[W. S. Gilbert]], a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of the opera ''[[Robert le Diable (opera)|Robert le Diable]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/gilbert_and_sullivan_part_1/Brief-Chronology.aspx Digital Guide to Gilbert &amp; Sullivan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031152934/http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/gilbert_and_sullivan_part_1/Brief-Chronology.aspx |date=31 October 2007 }} accessed 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was a venue primarily for burlesque, variety, continental [[operetta]] and light comedy under the management of John Hollingshead from 1868 to 1886, including several operettas by [[Jacques Offenbach]] and musical burlesques arranged by the theatre's music director, [[Wilhelm Meyer Lutz]]. Gilbert also wrote ''[[An Old Score]]'' for the theatre in 1869.&lt;ref name=spark&gt;Stewart, Maurice. 'The spark that lit the bonfire', in ''Gilbert and Sullivan News'' (London) Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nellie Farren]] soon became the theatre's star "principal boy" in all the burlesques and played in other comedies. She and comic [[Fred Leslie]] starred at the theatre for over 20 years, with [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]] for much of that period.  Her husband, [[Robert Soutar]] was an actor, stage manager and writer for the theatre. A typical evening at the Gaiety might include a three-act comic play, a dramatic interlude, a musical [[extravaganza]], which might also include a ballet or [[pantomime]] (in the tradition of a [[Harlequinade]]). During such four-hour-long bills-of-fare, regular patrons might skip an item on the programme to eat in one of the theatre's plush restaurants, play billiards in the on-site Billiard Room or drink in one of its several bars.&lt;ref name=spark/&gt;

[[File:Thespis - Illustrated London News Jan 6 1872.png|thumb|A contemporary illustration of ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'' from [[The Illustrated London News]] of 6 January 1872]]
In 1870, [[H. J. Byron]]'s ''Uncle Dick's Darling'' starred a young [[Henry Irving]].  This was the last play that theatre buff [[Charles Dickens]] saw before his death.  Irving also played in the popular and frequently played comical interlude, ''The Trial of Mr. Pickwick'', with Gaiety favourites [[J. L. Toole]] and Nellie Farren, who played [[Sam Weller (character)|Sam Weller]].&lt;ref name=spark/&gt;  ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', the first collaboration between [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], played at the theatre in 1871, with Farren as Mercury and [[J. L. Toole]] in the title role. Offenbach's ''[[Les deux aveugles]]'' played in 1872, starring [[Fred Sullivan]].  Two [[Dion Boucicault]] plays produced here in the early 1870s were ''Night and Morning'' and ''Led Astray''.  Among other burlesques written by Byron for the theatre from 1876 to 1879,&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, Amy Wai Sum. [http://whaleyween.com/Holly/DLB344_19thC_BritishDramatists/Byron.pdf "Henry J.

On 15 December 1880, the theatre presented ''Quicksands'', the first major English language adaptation of a drama by [[Henrik Ibsen]].  It was adapted by W. H. Vernon from Ibsen's ''[[The Pillars of Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibsen.net/index.gan?id=90071&amp;subid=0 "English first performances"], Ibsen.net, 12 May 2004, accessed 8 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Lutz and [[Robert Reece]]'s version of ''The Forty Thieves'' was performed in 1880 (following [[The Forty Thieves|an 1878 charity production]] of the same story), and ''[[Aladdin]]'' in 1881. In 1883, [[F. C. Burnand]] wrote a burlesque of ''[[The Tempest]]'' called ''Ariel'' for the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/10/22/106131305.pdf Review of ''Ariel''], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://footlightnotes.tripod.com/20040515home.html Information about ''Ariel'', 1883]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed]]'' was another 1883 burlesque.  Hollingshead's last production at the theatre was the burlesque ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885–86), produced together with his successor, [[George Edwardes]].  Hollingshead called himself a "licensed dealer in legs, short skirts, French adaptations, [[Shakespeare]], taste and musical glasses."&lt;ref name=cuttings&gt;&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) ''Cuttings''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104132022/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm |date=4 January 2008 }} accessed 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edwardes years==
[[File:1894 Lurcher.jpg|left|thumb|150px|1894: [[Arthur Williams (actor)|Arthur Williams]] as William Lurcher ''(A Sheriff's Officer)'', in ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'']]
Edwardes's first show was ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]''.  Although ''Dorothy'' called itself a [[comic opera]], as did most of the British musical works of the era that were neither burlesque, pantomime nor low farce, ''Dorothy'' incorporated some of the elements that US duo [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan and Hart]] were using on Broadway, integrating music and dance into the story line of the comedy.  Edwardes sold that production, but it went on to become the longest-running hit that the musical stage had ever seen.  Edwardes then returned the theatre to burlesque for a half dozen more years.  However, in the 1860s and 1870s, burlesques were one-act pieces running less than an hour and using pastiches and parodies of popular songs, opera arias and other music that the audience would readily recognise.  Edwardes expanded the format, adding an original score composed chiefly by [[Meyer Lutz]], and the shows were extended to a full-length two- or three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9, col. D&lt;/ref&gt;

These "new burlesques" included ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885), ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'' (1886), ''[[Miss Esmeralda]]'' (1887), ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888), ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'' (1888), ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'' (1890), ''Joan of Arc'' by [[Adrian Ross]] and J. L. Shine (1891) and ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891).&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1903), pp. 40–64&lt;/ref&gt; [[John D'Auban]] acted as the theatre's ballet-master and choreographed the Gaiety burlesques and other pieces from 1868 to 1891.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tm&gt;Biographical file for John D'Auban, list of productions and theatres, [[The Theatre Museum]], London (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[E. J. Lonnen]] joined the Gaiety for many of Lutz's burlesques.  After these, however, the age of burlesque was coming to an end, and with the retirement of Nellie Farren and Fred Leslie, it was essentially over.

[[File:1890 Gaiety Girls.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Gaiety Girls]], 1896]]
For ''Joan of Arc'', Edwardes had hired a young writer, [[Adrian Ross]], who next wrote a less baudy, more lightly comic piece, similar to ''Dorothy'', with a minimum of plot, focusing on songs with clever lyrics, ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892), with stylish costumes and urbane, witty banter.  Edwardes also engaged [[Ivan Caryll]] as resident composer and music director at the Gaiety and soon put Caryll together with the writing team of [[Owen Hall]], [[Harry Greenbank]], Ross and [[Lionel Monckton]].  Edwardes and this team created a series of musical shows similar to ''Dorothy'', but taking its lighter, breezier style a step further. These shows featured fashionable characters, tuneful music, romantic lyrics, witty banter and pretty dancing. The success of the first of these, ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1893), which played at other theatres, confirmed Edwardes on the path he was taking.

For the next two decades, the "girl" musicals packed the Gaiety Theatre, including titles like ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894), ''My Girl'' (1896),&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1903), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Circus Girl]]'' (1896), and ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' (1898).  These musicals were imitated at other theatres.  A particular attraction of the Gaiety shows was the beautiful, dancing [[Gaiety Girls]].  These were fashionable, elegant young ladies, unlike the corseted actresses from the burlesques.  Gaiety Girls were polite, well-behaved young women and became a popular attraction and a symbol of ideal womanhood.  Some became popular leading actresses.  The young ladies appearing in George Edwardes's shows became so popular that wealthy gentlemen, termed "Stage Door Johnnies", would wait outside the stage door hoping to escort them to dinner.  In some cases, a marriage into society and even the nobility resulted.  Edwardes arranged with Romano's restaurant, on the Strand, for his girls to dine there at half-price.  It was good exposure for the girls and made Romano's the centre of London's night-life.&lt;ref name=cuttings/&gt;

[[File:Gaietyprogramm.jpg|right|thumb|Part of the programme for the old Gaiety's farewell performance]]
[[Alan Hyman (writer)|Alan Hyman]], an expert on burlesque theatre who penned the 1972 book ''The Gaiety Years'', wrote:
:At the old Gaiety in the Strand the chorus was becoming a matrimonial agency for girls with ambitions to marry into the peerage and began in the nineties when [[Connie Gilchrist, Countess of Orkney|Connie Gilchrist]], a star of the Old Gaiety, married the [[Edmond FitzMaurice, 7th Earl of Orkney|7th Earl of Orkney]] and then in 1901, the [[Geoffrey Taylour, 4th Marquess of Headfort|4th Marquess of Headfort]] married Rosie Boote, who had charmed London the previous year when she sang Maisie in ''[[The Messenger Boy]]''.  After Connie Gilchrist and Rosie Boote had started the fashion a score of [[George Edwardes|the Guv'nor's]] budding stars left him to marry peers or men of title while other Gaiety Girls settled for a banker or a stockbroker.  The Guv'nor finding this was playing ducks and drakes with his theatrical plans had a 'nuptial clause' inserted in every contract....  [[Debutantes]] were competing with the other girls to get into the Gaiety chorus while upper-class youths were joining the ranks of the chorus boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.happenstances.com/other.html Information about the stagedoor Johnnie marriages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509195156/http://www.happenstances.com/other.html |date=9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was demolished in 1903 as part of the road widening of the East Strand and the new Aldwych-Kingsway road development, and Edwardes quickly built the ''New Gaiety Theatre'' at the corner of Aldwych and the Strand.  ''[[The Orchid]]'' (1903) opened the new theatre, followed by ''[[The Spring Chicken]]'' (1905), ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' (1907), ''[[Our Miss Gibbs]]'' (1909), ''[[Peggy (musical)|Peggy]]'' (1911), ''[[The Sunshine Girl]]'' (1912), ''[[The Girl on the Film]]'' (1913), ''Adele'' (1914), and ''After the Girl'' (1914).

Perhaps to balance the "girl" musicals for which the Gaiety was famous, Edwardes also presented a series of "boy"-themed musicals, such as ''[[The Messenger Boy]]'' (1900), ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901, which introduced [[Gertie Millar]]), ''Two Naughty Boys'' (1906), ''[[The New Aladdin]]'' (1906), ''Havana'' (1908).  Later, [[George Grossmith, Jr.]] and [[Edward Laurillard]] produced a number of successes at the theatre, including ''[[Tonight's the Night (1914 musical)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (1915) and ''[[Theodore &amp; Co]]'' (1916).  Many of these popular musicals toured after their runs at the Gaiety, both in the British provinces and internationally.  [[Leopold Wenzel]] conducted during the Edwardian period, leaving the theatre in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;"Retirement of Gaiety Conductor", ''The Observer'', 23 February 1913, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and demise==
[[File:Gaiety1.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The theatre around 1910]]
Edwardes died in 1915, leaving his estate indebted and the theatre (as well as Edwardes' other theatres, including [[Daly's Theatre]]), in the hands of [[Robert Evett]], formerly a leading [[tenor]] of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].  [[Manuel Klein]] was music director at the Gaiety for several years beginning in 1915.  Under Evett's management, the theatre prospered with another hit, ''[[Going Up (musical)|Going Up]]'' (1918), followed by ''The Kiss Call'' (1919), and ''Faust on Toast'' (1921).  In 1922, Evett produced Gaiety adaptations of ''Catherine'' and ''[[The Last Waltz (operetta)|The Last Waltz]]'', a work of which he was co-author. The same year, the revue ''Pins and Needles'' opened starring the French beauty [[Agnès Souret]] and had a run of nine months before transferring to the Shubert Theatre, New York.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/15/109831329.pdf "Pins and Needles Here"], ''The New York Times'', 15 January 1922&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, Evett produced ''Our Nell'', the revised version of ''Our Peg''.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Musicals continued at the Gaiety.  In 1929, ''[[Love Lies (musical)|Love Lies]]'', by [[Stanley Lupino]] and [[Arthur Rigby (actor)|Arthur Rigby]], starring [[Cyril Ritchard]] and [[Madge Elliott]], had a successful run at the theatre.  In the 1930s, the theatre played works such as ''[[Sporting Love]]'' (1934) by composer and pianist [[Billy Mayerl]], also with Lupino, which ran for 302 performances.  The last show at the theatre was the farce ''Running Riot'', in 1939.&lt;ref name=cuttings/&gt;

By 1938 the Gaiety Theatre was in need of refurbishment.  However, the theatre no longer conformed to the then current licensing regulations, and so extensive modernisation was required.  This was not considered to be financially viable and in 1939 the Gaiety Theatre closed.  The interior fittings were stripped from the building, and sold at auction.  Standing empty during [[World War II]], the building suffered further damage as a result of bombing during [[airstrike|air raids]].

In 1946 the shell of the Gaiety Theatre was purchased by [[Lupino Lane]] for £200,000.  It was the intention to rebuild the theatre and make it, once again, a centre of musical comedy.  Although restoration did commence, it was found that the structural problems were worse than expected and the work discontinued.  The building was once again sold, resulting in it being demolished in 1956&lt;ref&gt;"London land mark to be torn down", ''The New York Times'', 13 July 1950&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by an office development.

From 2006, a new luxury hotel was being built on the site, the Silken Hotel, designed by [[Foster &amp; Partners]].  At the rear, one of the walls of the old restaurant, which has [[listed building]] status, was being incorporated into all the new development.  However, work on the hotel was halted in 2008 when the developers went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Strandmusikhall/GaietyTheatreSiteThenAndNow.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (Images of the Gaiety)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116152150/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Strandmusikhall/GaietyTheatreSiteThenAndNow.htm |date=16 November 2007 }} accessed 26 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Glycine Airman 42 "Double Twelve" GL0061.jpg|thumb|Glycine Airman 42 "Double Twelve" GL0061 watch.]]
Founded as ''Fabrique d'Horlogerie La Glycine'' in 1914 by Swiss [[watchmaker]] Eugène Meylan, Glycine initially specialized in designing and manufacturing small movements for ladies watches, and during the 1930s, Glycine launched its own [[Automatic watch|self-winding]] watches, and subsequently, [[chronometer watch]]es.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=space&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dutch&gt;{{cite web|url=https://andres55.home.xs4all.nl/glycine%20airman.pdf|title=Glycine Airline: A 24 Hour Timeline of Flight|work=[[André Stikkers]]|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timepiecechronicle.com/features/2017/10/18/uqeztr7g87jdmo07cc66aj4gw2bb9g|title=In-Depth: The History of the Glycine Airman|work=[[Timepiece Chronicle]]|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[Transatlantic flight|intercontinental air travel]], the Glycine Airman was released in 1953, for meeting the needs of pilots.&lt;ref name=space&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=invicta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wornandwound.com/under-invicta-glycine-promises-to-focus-on-airman-and-combat-lines|title=Under Invicta, Glycine Promises to Focus on Airman and Combat Lines|work=[[Worn and Wound]]|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The watch had a calendar function, a rotating 24-hour bezel with a locking mechanism, and a 24-hour dial with AM, PM and Noon written on it.&lt;ref name=french&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dutch&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=models&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wornandwound.com/glycine-soars-3-new-airman-watches/|title=Glycine Soars with 3 New Airman Watches|work=[[Worn and Wound]]|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with its aviation link, Glycine also introduced the Airman SST in 1967, inspired by [[supersonic transport]] aircraft such as the [[Boeing 2707]], and featured a [[Oak (wine)|tonneau]]-shaped case, orange dial, and internal rotating bezel.&lt;ref name=dutch&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To date, Glycine has released various reiteration of the original Airman, including watches featuring GMT hand, date magnifier, chronograph, or 12-hour movements.&lt;ref name=history&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=models&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Glycine joined the [[Invicta Watch Group]], with Invicta's primary involvement on developing distribution and marketing strategies for the company.&lt;ref name=invicta&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gone Are the Days!''''' is a 1963 American [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] starring [[Ossie Davis]], [[Ruby Dee]] and [[Godfrey Cambridge]]. It is based on the Broadway play ''Purlie Victorious'', which was written by Davis.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Davis, Dee, Cambridge, [[Beah Richards]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Sorrell Booke]] reprised their roles from the play. This was also Alda's film debut.

==Cast==
* Ossie Davis as Reverend Purlie Victorious Judson
* Ruby Dee as Lutiebelle Gussie Mae Jenkins
* Godfrey Cambridge as Gitlow Judson
* Hilda Haynes as Missy Judson
* Beah Richards as Idella Landy
* Alan Alda as Charlie Cotchipee
* Charles Welch as Sheriff
* Ralph Roberts as Deputy
* Sorrell Booke as Ol' Cap', Stonewall Jackson Cotchipee

==Reception==
''[[The New York Times]]'' review stated, "The cancers of segregation, blind bigotry and Uncle Tom were made funny but real, and therefore howlingly effective, by the dual artistry of playwright-star Ossie Davis. As a Negro seeing his people and their tormentors comically plain, he filled the stage with humor, insight and passion."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/09/24/archives/purlie-and-his-friends-return-in-a-film-gone-are-the-days.html |title=Purlie and His Friends Return in a Film, 'Gone Are the Days!' |date=September 24, 1963 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic noted, however, that "Mr. Davis's{{sic|,}} manufactured folk tale has, with the passage of just two years and the shedding of blood in Birmingham, lost some of its laughter. And the somewhat static quality of Nicholas Webster's direction, which clings to stage techniques, is not much of a help."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

The '''Grand Theatre''' was a theatre in the [[Yiddish Theatre District]] in Manhattan in [[New York City]] built for Yiddish productions, the first of its kind.&lt;ref name="source10"&gt;Rosenfeld, Lulla Adler. [https://books.google.com/books?ei=2_izTpTOH-Ha0QHm19mqBA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=W1llAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Grand+Theatre%22+yiddish&amp;q=%22Grand+Theatre%22#search_anchor The Yiddish theatre and Jacob P. Adler], p. 299 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; The theater was built in 1904 by Jacob Pavlovitch Adler, a famous Russian-born Jewish actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/GrandTheatre.html|title=Grand Theatre - New York City|website=www.nycago.org|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

On March 12, 1902, [[Sophia Karp]], with [[Jacob Fischel]] and playwright [[Joseph Lateiner]], founded the Grand Theatre in New York City. The city's first theatre built specifically for [[Yiddish]] productions,&lt;ref name=moses&gt;Moses Rischin, ''The promised city: New York's Jews, 1870–1914''&lt;/ref&gt; the Grand was typical of Yiddish theatres of the time by being largely artist-managed. Besides Karp and Lateiner, the directors included leading man [[Moishe Finkel|Morris Finkel]], comedian [[Bernard Bernstein]], L. S. Gottlieb, and composer [[Louis Friedsell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/02/08/117985234.pdf | date=February 8, 1903 | title=Actors Own New Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on February 5, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/02/01/101970462.pdf | date=February 1, 1903 | title=A New Jewish Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/02/06/101971732.pdf | date=February 6, 1903 | title=Grand Theatre Opened}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Two events in 1904 symbolized the decline of the serious stage. Jacob Gordin failed as the director of his own theater and Jacob Adler, the leading exponent of Gordin's dramas, opened the Grand Theater – the first structure built specifically for the Yiddish stage. In 1912 [[Boris Thomashefsky|T[h]omashefsky]]'s new [[National Theater (Manhattan)|National Theater]] on [[Houston Street]] even surpassed the Grand in the magnificence of its appointments. The National compared favorably with [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] palaces and offered similar enjoyments subject to the same commercial will-o'-the-wisp.&lt;ref name=moses /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Italian performances also were done at the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Aleandri, Emelise. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3qx0PH1jwG4C&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Italian-American Immigrant Theatre of New York City''], p. 45 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Guilty or Innocent of Using the N Word''''' is a 2006 documentary directed by British director Bhavna Malkani.

The documentary explores questions and issues surrounding the word "[[nigger]]" that many feel constrained to discuss, as is often categorized as a [[Word taboo|taboo word]]. The twenty-eight-minute film investigates the word chronologically, discussing the history of the word from its origins all the way to [[hip hop]]'s influence on the acceptance and commercialization of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1536073 IMDB listing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Guest appearances in the documentary include [[M-1 (rapper)|M-1]] of [[Dead Prez]], Grouchy Greg, CEO of allhiphop.com, Philadelphia rapper [[The Last Emperor (rapper)|The Last Emperor]], hip-hop producer/rapper Marchitect and others.

The documentary was filmed in London, England; New York City, New York; [[Newark, Delaware]]; and [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. ''Guilty or Innocent of Using the N Word'' won the London Film Convention Award at the [[Portobello Film Festival]] in 2006 and Best Short Documentary at New York's 5th Annual H20 Odyssey International Hip-Hop Awards in 2007.  The documentary was also short listed to win Best Film at the 5th Buffalo Film Festival in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://bstarproductions.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hendrik Maarten Krabbé''', or '''Heinrich Martin Krabbé''' (4 May 1868, [[London]] - 22 December 1931, [[Amsterdam]]) was a Dutch [[Genre art|genre artist]] and portrait painter.

== Biography ==
His father worked as a claims examiner for a life insurance company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/kwartierstaat-krabbe-en-genealogie-hilligehekken/R554.php Family tree] @ GenealogieOnline.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1883 to 1888, he attended the [[Quellinusschool]] and the [[Rijksakademie]] in Amsterdam, where he studied painting with [[August Allebé]] and lithography with {{ill|Rudolf Stang|de}}.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://www.devalk.com/kunstenaars/krabbe/krabbe.html De Valk Lexicon kunstenaars Laren-Blaricum Biographical notes] @ the De Valk Lexicon kunstenaars Laren-Blaricum.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, he lived in [[Bussum]] for several years then taught at the School of applied arts in [[Haarlem]] from 1896 to 1906.

Among his best-known students were {{ill|Arnold Willem Kort|nl}} and {{ill|Ina Scholten-van Heek|nl}}.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[http://www.hmkrabbe.nl Biographical notes] @ the H.M.Krabbé website.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1906, he took up residence at the artists' colony in [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]]. During this time, he married the singer Miep Rust (1874-1956). From 1916 to 1923 he was back in Bussum, but spent 1920 on a study trip in Chicago. 

He initially painted genre scenes, military personnel and interiors with figures. For the last twenty years of his life, he focused on portraits.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; He was a long-standing member of [[Arti et Amicitiae]].&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; In the late 1920s, he retired to Amsterdam and died there in 1931.

His son, [[Maarten Krabbé|Maarten]], became one of the best known Dutch painters of the 20th century. Maarten's youngest son, [[Mirko Krabbé|Mirko]], is also a painter; his middle son, [[Jeroen Krabbé|Jeroen]], is an actor and director; and his eldest is the writer [[Tim Krabbé]]. Jeroen's son [[Jasper Krabbé|Jasper]] is also an artist.

'''Ida Barlow''' (also '''Leathers''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Coronation Street]]'', played by [[Noel Dyson]] between 1960 and 1961.&lt;ref name="thecoronationstreetstory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Little|first= Daran|authorlink= Daran Little|title= The Coronation Street Story |year=1995|publisher=Boxtree|isbn=1-85283-464-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==

===Casting===
Creator [[Tony Warren]] originally had [[Betty Alberge]] in mind for the part of Ida when writing the first scripts, but when Alberge auditioned everyone agreed she was more suited to the role of shopkeeper [[Florrie Lindley]],&lt;ref name="25years"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nown|first= Graham|title= Coronation Street 25 Years|year=1985|publisher=Ward Lock|isbn=0-7063-6405-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving auditions for Ida wide open until Noel Dyson was found.

===Background===
Ida Leathers was born in 1916 to [[Nancy Leathers]] ([[Norah Hammond]]). Ida grew up to be a soft, caring, almost saintly woman and married the love of her life [[Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)|Frank Barlow]] (Frank Pemberton) in 1938. They went on to have two sons - [[Ken Barlow|Kenneth]] ([[William Roache]]) in 1939, and [[David Barlow (Coronation Street)|David]] ([[Alan Rothwell]]) in 1942, and thus Ida found her new place in life as housewife and relished it. She spent most of her time looking after her family and keeping the house running, rarely socialising in the [[Rovers Return|Rovers]] at all.&lt;ref name="weatherfieldlife"&gt;{{cite book |last=Little|first= Daran|authorlink= Daran Little|title= Weatherfield Life: A Portrait of the Street 1902-1992 |year=1992|publisher=Boxtree|isbn=1-85283-186-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
Ida was the perfect housewife and doted on Frank and her boys. Ida had a special friendship with the Barlows' next-door neighbour, [[Albert Tatlock]] ([[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]]), and visited him on a regular basis, unlike his daughter [[Beattie Pearson]] ([[Gabrielle Daye]]), which sometimes caused friction between the two women (or at least disparaging comments from Beattie), despite Ida's calm nature.

Ida's mother [[Nancy Leathers]] (Norah Hammond) moved into No.3 in 1961, due to her failing health, and no-one expected her to outlive her daughter. One day when Ida was visiting Beattie, concern grew when Ida never arrived. Later that day, Frank learned that Ida had been hit by the bus she was intending to catch and died. Ida's funeral episode saw a new peak in viewing figures for ''Coronation Street'', with 15.6 million viewers tuning in.

===Departure and death===
It was announced that [[Noel Dyson]] had quit the role of Ida, after less than a year, and that she was tired of playing her. It was then confirmed that the character would be killed off to increase viewing numbers. Ida was struck by a bus and [[Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)|Frank Barlow]] was devastated. Dyson played Ida in 41 episodes overall. Her final appearance was in episode 77; although no death scene was shown and the events of her death unfolded on-screen from the next episode onwards. She was the first regular character to die, second overall.

It describes an operation in Crete during the Second World War to capture German general [[Heinrich Kreipe]]. Moss kept a diary during the war years and based his book on it. The 2014 edition includes an introduction by one of Moss's children and an afterword by [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]].

The story was made into a [[Ill Met by Moonlight (film)|1957 film with the same title]] starring [[Dirk Bogarde]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] writer-director-producer team of [[Powell and Pressburger|Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger]].

==Development and publication==
Moss recounted his and [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]]’s activities during the [[Second World War]] as agents in [[Crete]] of the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), notably their extraordinary [[Kidnap of General Kreipe|kidnapping of Heinrich Kreipe]], Commander of the [[22nd Air Landing Division (Wehrmacht)|22nd Air Landing Infantry Division]] that was occupying Crete, and his removal to [[Cairo]] (and British war forces) in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Secret War Exhibition, Imperial War Museum, London,|url= http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-london}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was written in early 1945 but was censored by the Head of SOE, [[Colin Gubbins|Major-General Sir Colin Gubbins]] (CD), by instruction to [[Colin Hercules Mackenzie|Colin Mackenzie]] (BB100), Head of [[Force 136]]. When the book was finally published in 1950, it was selected by [[W. Somerset Maugham]] as one of the best three books of that year writing,"more thrilling than any detective story I can remember, and written in a modest and most engaging manner".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times '', 24 December 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''London Mystery Magazine #10 '', June - July 1951, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The book was chosen to lead the BBC's famous radio series ''Now it can be told'' of 1950. It has been republished many times since and remains in print.

The title is a [[List of titles of works based on Shakespearean phrases|quotation]] from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 60).

The book has been translated into Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Mal encuentro a la luz de la luna'', 2014, Acantilado, Translator: Dolores Payás |url=http://www.acantilado.es/catalogo/mal-encuentro-a-la-luz-de-la-luna/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Brutti Incontri al Chiaro di Luna", 2018, Adelphi, Translator: Gianni Pannofino, |url=https://www.adelphi.it/libro/9788845932472}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='' Κακό φεγγαραντάμωμα: Το χρονικό της απαγωγής του Στρατηγού Κράιπε'', 2015, Metaichmio, Translator: Μυρσίνη Γκανά |url=https://www.metaixmio.gr/el/products/%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%8C-%CF%86%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%AC%CE%BC%CF%89%CE%BC%CE%B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{main|Kidnap of Heinrich Kreipe}}

In May 1941, German forces attacked and occupied Crete. Allied forces were driven back and evacuated to North Africa by June. The [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) inserted agents on Crete in order to work with the local [[Cretan resistance|resistance]] in harrying German occupying forces.

On 4 February 1944, Major [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]] and Captain [[William Stanley Moss]] and two Cretan SOE agents left Egypt by plane for Crete. Their intention was to parachute into Crete but after arriving at the [[drop zone]], only Leigh Fermor was able to parachute successfully. The others had to abandon the attempt due to bad weather and were returned to Egypt. On landing Leigh Fermor was met by a group from the [[Cretan resistance]], with whom he remained until the arrival of the rest of the SOE team. After three more attempts at a parachute jump over a two-month period, Moss and the other two arrived by Motor Launch ML 842 on 4 April 1944. They were met on the beach by Leigh Fermor and another SOE agent, Sandy Rendel.

Their target General Müller was replaced by General Kreipe just before they arrived.  The team decided to proceed with the plan to abduct the German commanding officer.  The SOE team included a number of Cretans; 'Anthony' (Antonis Papaleonidas), 'Micky' (Michalis Akoumianakis) and Grigorios Chnarakis. Micky was especially welcome as his house was opposite Kreipe's residence, the [[Villa Ariadne]], in the village of [[Knossos]]. The team reconnoitred the area and planned the abduction. Dressed as a Cretan shepherd, Leigh Fermor travelled on the local bus to check Knossos and the area around the German headquarters. He decided that the German headquarters would be too difficult to penetrate. After a few days of alternately observing the actions of the General, they finalized the details of the abduction. The plan was for the two British officers, dressed as [[corporal]]s in the  ''[[Feldgendarmerie]]'' (German military police), to stop the general's car on his way home at what was supposed to be a routine check point.

On the night of 26 April 1944, the two British officers stopped the General's car before the Villa Ariadne. When the car stopped, Leigh Fermor took care of Kreipe and Moss knocked the driver out with his cosh.&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre, Ben, ''The Times'', 11 June 2011, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moss's cosh held by Imperial War Museum London, Catalogue ref WEA 4182&lt;/ref&gt; Moss drove the team and the General in the General's car for an hour and a half through 22 controlled road blocks in [[Heraklion]] before leaving Leigh Fermor to abandon the car. When Leigh Fermor left the car, he also left documents revealing that the kidnapping had been done by [[British Commandos]] so that no reprisals should be taken against the local population.

With his Cretan escorts, Moss set off with the General across country to a rendezvous where they would be joined by Leigh Fermor. Hunted by German patrols, the group moved across the mountains to reach the southern side of the island, where a British motor launch (ML 842 commanded by Brian Coleman) was to pick them up. On 14 May 1944, the SOE team and the general were finally picked up from a beach near [[Rodakino]], possibly Peristeres beach, on the southern side of the island. They were transported to safety, landing at [[Mersa Matruh]] in Egypt.

After the war, a member of Kreipe’s staff reported how, on hearing the news of the kidnapping, an uneasy silence in the officers' mess in Heraklion was followed by, “Well gentlemen, I think this calls for champagne all round.”&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;Cooper, Artemis, ''Cairo in the War 1939–1945'', Hamish Hamilton, 1989, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Post War correspondence explains that Kreipe was disliked by his soldiers because, amongst other things, he objected to the stopping of his own vehicle for checking in compliance with his commands concerning approved travel orders. This tension between the General and his troops, in part, explains the caution of sentries in considering stopping the General’s car as Moss drove it through Heraklion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Beutin, Dr Ludwig, Letter to W. Stanley Moss, 27 September 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was due to be published in Germany in 1950. Kreipe alleged that he had never given his parole not to shout or to try to   escape to Moss and Leigh Fermor as described by Moss in the book. Kreipe secured an injunction preventing publication of the book in Germany on the grounds that the statement in the book was untrue.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Oliver, ''Ill Met by Moonlight:The Post-War Cultural Narrative of the Abduction of General Kreipe in Crete, 1944'', 2018, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; Leigh Fermor's report after the operation&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Fermor, Patrick, ''Short Report on Capture of General Kreipe", TNA File HS5/418
1944, p3.&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication of his account of the abduction published in 2015 both corroborated Moss's version of events.

An '''iwan''' ({{lang-fa|ایوان}} ''eyvān'', {{lang-ar|إيوان}} ''Iwan'', also spelled '''ivan''', Turkish: eyvan)&lt;ref name=Wright508&gt;{{harvp|Wright|1992|p=508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boas266&gt;{{harvp|Boas|2010|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a rectangular hall or space, usually vaulted, walled on three sides, with one end entirely open. The formal gateway to the iwan is called ''pishtaq'', a [[Persian language|Persian]] term for a portal projecting from the facade of a building, usually decorated with [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]] bands, glazed tilework, and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric designs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archnet.org/library/dictionary/entry.jsp?entry_id=DIA0502 Dictionary of Islamic architecture: Pishtaq] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629172823/https://archnet.org/library/dictionary/entry.jsp?entry_id=DIA0502 |date=2011-06-29 }}  archnet.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/461774/pishtaq Pishtaq] ''[[Britannica.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the definition allows for some interpretation, the overall forms and characteristics can vary greatly in terms of scale, material, or decoration. Iwans are most commonly associated with [[Islamic architecture]]; however, the form is [[Persian architecture|Iranian]] in origin and was invented much earlier and fully developed in [[Mesopotamia]] around the third century CE, during the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] period of [[Persia]]. 

==Etymology==

The root of this term is [[Old Persian]] 'Apadana' (see [[Apadana]] palace at [[Persepolis]]) where king [[Darius I]] declares in an inscription, "I, Darius, ... had this 'Apadana' constructed ...". Apadana is a name given to this particular palace in modern literature, although the name simply implies a type of structure, the iwan, not a particular palace.  The term in [[Old Persian]] means "unprotected" (â-pâd-ânâ), and the design allows the structure to be open to the elements on one side. At Persepolis, however, the 'apadana' takes the form of a [[veranda]], that is, a flat roof held up by columns, rather than a vault — but still open to the elements on only one side. A comparable structure is found 2000 years later in [[Isfahan]] at the Palace of [[Chehel Sotoun]]. By the time of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and the [[Sasanian]] dynasties, the iwan had emerged as two types of structure: the old columned one, and a newer vaulted structure—both, however, carrying the same native name of apadana/iwan, because both types are "unprotected" (open on one side to the elements).

Iwans were a trademark of the [[Parthian Empire]] (247 BC–AD 224) and later the [[Sassanid]] architecture of [[Persia]] (224 -651), later finding their way throughout the Arab and [[Islamic architecture]] which started developing in 7th century AD, after the period of [[Muhammad]] (c. 570–632).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archnet.org/library/dictionary/entry.jsp?entry_id=DIA0162&amp;mode=full|title=Dictionary of Islamic architecture: Ivvan|publisher=archnet.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629172834/https://archnet.org/library/dictionary/entry.jsp?entry_id=DIA0162&amp;mode=full|archivedate=2011-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development reached its peak during the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuki]] era, when iwans became a fundamental unit in architecture, and later the [[Mughal architecture]].&lt;ref name=Farrokh173&gt;{{harvp|Farrokh|2007|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Warren|Fethi|1982|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form is not confined to any particular function, and is found in buildings for either secular or religious uses, and in both public and residential architecture. 

''Ivan'' is an alternative form of the name, used in Iran, reflecting the [[Persian language|Persian]] pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sitwell|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Many scholars - including Edward Keall, André Godard, Roman Ghirshman, and Mary Boyce - discuss the invention of the iwan in Mesopotamia, the area around today's [[Iraq]]. Although debate remains among scholars as to how the iwan developed, there is a general consensus that the iwan evolved locally, and was thus not imported from another area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keall|1974|pp= 129–130}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Some scholars have claimed that the iwan developed not in Mesopotamia, but in [[Nisa, Turkmenistan | Nisaea]] (the ancient Parthian capital) where it was a result of Greek workers living and working in Parthia. For more information on the Nisaea theory, see {{harvp|Curatola|Scarcia|2004|p= 57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar structures, known as "pesgams", were found in many [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Zoroastrian]] homes in [[Yazd]], where two or four halls would open onto a central court; however, it is not known whether these spaces were vaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keall|1974|p= 126}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The feature which most distinctly makes the iwan a landmark development in the history of Ancient Near Eastern architecture is the incorporation of a [[Vault (architecture) |vault]]ed ceiling. A vault is defined{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} as a ceiling made from arches, known as [[arch|arcuated]], usually constructed with stone, concrete, or bricks.&lt;ref&gt;Doulas Harper, "Vault", last modified 2010, www.dictionary.com.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2018}} Earlier buildings would normally be covered in a [[post and lintel|trabeated]] manner, with [[post and lintel]] beams. However, vaulted ceilings did exist in the ancient world before the invention of the iwan, both within Mesopotamia and outside it. Mesopotamian examples include [[Susa]], where the [[Elam]]ites vaulted many of their buildings with [[barrel vaults]], and [[Nineveh]], where the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] frequently vaulted their passages for fortification purposes.&lt;ref name="Keall, Early Iwans, 124"&gt;{{harvp|Keall|1974|p= 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Outside Mesopotamia, a number of extant vaulted structures stand, including many examples from [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Rome]], and the [[Mycenaeans]]. For example, the Mycenaean [[Treasury of Atreus]], constructed around 1250 BCE, features a large [[corbel]]led dome. Egyptian architecture began to use vaulting in its structures after the Third Dynasty, after around 2600 BCE, constructing very early barrel vaults using mud bricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smith|Simpson|1998|pp= 18, 82}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parthian Iwans ==
Although some scholars have asserted that the iwan form may have developed under the [[Seleucid]]s, today most scholars agree that the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] were the inventors of the iwan.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Although the Parthians have been credited with the invention of the first fully developed  iwan, there have been claims that some iwan-like forms existed during the Seleucid period in Mesopotamia, namely at Dura Europos. F. E. Brown claimed that an iwan-type hall may have existed in the Temple of Zeus Megistos; however it has been contested. Many scholars believe that any iwans built at the Temple were likely later Parthian additions. Brown argued that the Temple of Zeus Megistos could have been modeled after the triple-iwan terraces at Masjid-I Solaiman or Bard-è Néchandeh, both of which archaeologist Roman Ghirshman claimed to date from the Achaemenid Persians; however, in later excavations Ghirshman discovered that both terraces did not in fact support iwan structures. Susan Downey argues that both the date and the western location make any early iwans at Dura Europos unlikely. Every other iwan from before the Sasanian period is found further east, such as at Hatra, Ashur, or Seleucia-on-the-Tigris. For more information on the claimed Seleucid iwans, see {{harvp|Downey|1988|pp=78–85}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest Parthian iwans was found at [[Seleucia| Seleucia (Seleucia-on-the-Tigris)]], located on the [[Tigris River]], where the shift from post-and-lintel construction to vaulting occurred around the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Keall, Early Iwans, 124"/&gt; Other early iwans have been suggested at Ashur, where two buildings containing iwan-like foundations were found. The first building, located near the ruins of a [[ziggurat]], featured a three-iwan façade.&lt;ref name="Downey_151"&gt;{{harvp|Downey|1988|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity of the building to a ziggurat suggests that it may have been used for religious preparations or rituals.&lt;ref name="Downey_151"/&gt; It could also indicate a palatial building, as it was common for the ziggurat and palace to be situated next to one another in the Ancient Near East. What seems to be a palace courtyard had iwans on each side, which remained a common features well into Islamic times.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 46&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second iwan building is located across a courtyard, and Walter Andrae, a German archaeologist, suggested that it served as an administrative building rather than as a religious center because there is no evidence of inscriptions or wall carvings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Downey|1988|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the absence of inscriptions or carvings does not equate necessarily to a civic function, it was not uncommon for iwans to serve a secular use, as they were frequently incorporated into palaces and community spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Curatola|Scarcia|2004|pp=56–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early sites including Parthian iwans include [[Hatra]], the Parthian ruins at [[Dura Europos]], and [[Uruk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Downey|1988|pp=137–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Sassanian Iwans ==

The [[Sassanid Empire|Sasanian Persians]] also favored the iwan form, and adopted it into much of their architecture; however, they transformed the function. The Parthian iwan led to other spaces, but its primary function served as a room itself. In contrast, the Sasanian iwan served as a grand entranceway to a larger, more elegant space which was usually domed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Curatola|Scarcia|2004|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Parthian and Sasanian iwans were often elaborately decorated with inscriptions and sculpted reliefs including scenes of hunting, vegetal motifs, abstract, geometric patterns, and animal scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Curatola|Scarcia|2004|pp=94–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Downey|1988|pp=156–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reliefs’ style shows a blend of influences including other Near Eastern cultures, [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Byzantine]] decorative traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Curatola|Scarcia|2004|pp=92–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the rock-cut iwan at [[Taq-i Bustan]] features Roman style figures, Eastern-inspired vegetal patterns and crenellations, and wide-eyed, stylized Byzantine-esque angels and mosaic interiors.

===The Iwan of Khosrau===
[[File:ArchOfCtesiphon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Taq-i Kisra]], [[Ctesiphon]], c. 540]]

The most famous example of a [[Persian architecture|Persian]] [[Sassanids|Sassanid]] iwan is the [[Taq-i Kisra]] ("Iwan of Khosrau"), part of a palace complex in [[Mada'in]] which is the only visible remaining structure of the ancient Sasanian capital of [[Ctesiphon]]. It is near the modern town of [[Salman Pak]], [[Iraq]], on the Tigris River about twenty-five miles south of Baghdad. Construction began during the reign of [[Khosrau I]] after a campaign against the Eastern Romans in 540 AD.&lt;ref name=Julian185&gt;{{harvp|Reade|1999|pp=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arched iwan hall, open on the facade side, was about 37 meters high 26 meters across and 50 meters long, the largest [[vault (architecture)|vault]] ever constructed at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Iran, Seven Faces of Civilization - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtcE37IIqfQ&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt; Early photographs and 19th-century drawings show that the remaining part of the hall has reduced since then.

The dating for the Taq-i Kisra has been debated throughout history; however, a variety of documents detailing the arrival of Byzantine sculptors and architects sent by the Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian]], suggest that the correct date for the construction is around 540 CE.&lt;ref name="Kurz"&gt;{{harvp|Kurz|1941|pp=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 540 CE date suggests that the construction of the Taq-i Kisra, and perhaps Justinian’s “help” was in response to the victory of Sasanian king Khosrau I over [[Antioch]] in 540 CE, which is depicted in the mosaics decorating the interior of the Taq-i Kisra.&lt;ref name="Kurz"/&gt; The Taq-i Kisra was finally demolished for the most part by al-Mansur, who reused the bricks to build his own palace complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bier|1993|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic art]] and architecture was also heavily influenced inspired by Roman, Byzantine, and Sasanian designs, both due to the presence of extant examples and contact between cultures. For example, the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque of Damascus]] was built in the early eighth century CE on the site of a Roman Christian Church, and incorporates a [[nave]]-like element with a tall arcade and [[clerestory]]. The Sasanian Empire also had a tremendous impact on the development of Islamic architecture; however, there was some overlap between the Sasanians and the Muslims making it difficult at times to determine who was influencing whom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bier|1993|pp=58–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic art and architecture borrows many Sasanian decorative motifs and architectural forms, including the iwan; however, the adoption of the iwan was not immediate. For example, the implementation of the standard four-iwan plan which has become standard in Islamic mosque design was not introduced until the twelfth century, long after its invention in the first century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keall|1974|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iwans were used frequently in Islamic non-religious architecture before the twelfth century, including houses, community spaces, and civic structures such as the bridge of [[Si-o-Se Pol]] in [[Isfahan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Curatola|Scarcia|2004|pp=129–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Islamic architecture incorporated the Sasanian placement for the iwan by making it a grand entrance to the prayer hall or to a mosque tomb, and often placing it before a domed space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bier|1993|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as often using numbers of iwans on the exterior of buildings, as at the [[Taj Mahal]], iwans were often placed on all or several sides of internal spaces and courtyards, a form going back to Parthian times.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first elaborate iwans used in an Islamic religious context can be found at the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which dates from the 12th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Najm|2001|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the evolution of the standard four-iwan plan has been debated by scholars, and some claim that it originated in [[madrasas]], or religious schools designed to educate aristocratic children about [[Sunni Islam|Sunnism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Godard|1951|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the four-iwan plan was already in use in palace and temple architecture during both the Parthian and Sasanian periods.&lt;ref name="Keall, Early Iwans, 124"/&gt; The use of iwans would continue to flourish in both mosques and secular spaces starting in the thirteenth century, and would become one of the most iconic features of Islamic architecture, as suggested by the elaborate seventeenth-century iwans in the [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan|Great Mosque at Isfahan]].

==The Great Iwan of Cairo==
The Great Iwan (or al-Iwan al-Kabir, Dar al-'Adl, Iwan of al-Nasir) of [[Cairo]] was a public and ceremonial space located in the southern section of the [[Saladin Citadel]] where the [[Mamluk]] [[sultan]] sat enthroned to administer justice, receive ambassadors, and carry out other duties of state. The structure used to be known as Dar al-'Adl during the reign of [[Saladin]], the [[Mamluk]] ruler of the [[Bahri dynasty]] [[Al-Nasir Muhammad]] rebuilt the monumental structure twice, in 1315 and 1334. The Great Iwan was demolished by [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] in the early 19th century.

The 19th century ''[[Description de l'Égypte]]'' depicted a square [[hypostyle]] structure with five parallel aisles and a dome. The building was open to the exterior on three sides through arcades, and the main façade was articulated with a large central arch flanked by two smaller arches on either side.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rabbat|1989|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gillispie|Dewachter|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Japanese Animation Creators Association''' ('''JAniCA''') is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving working conditions for workers in the [[anime]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janica.jp/ Janica Q+A&lt;/ref&gt; The group was formed in June 2007.

==History==
On October 15, 2007 over 500 animators gathered together to announce the formation of JAniCA under its president [[Toyoo Ashida]]. Among the other creators who spoke at the October 13 press conference were director [[Satoshi Kon]], animation director Moriyasu Taniguchi, Tokyo University graduate school professor Yasuki Hamano, editor Nobuyuki Takahashi and animation director Akihiro Kanayama.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-10-15/japanese-animators-directors-establish-first-union&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008 JAniCA was legally incorporated as an [[Unlimited liability company]] [[intermediary corporation]] to further continue improving the work conditions in the Japanese animation industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-06-06/japan-animator-labor-group-legally-incorporates&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 JAniCA launched their {{nihongo|"[[Young Animator Training Project]]"|若手アニメーター育成プロジェクト|Wakate Animētā Ikusei Purojekuto}}. The group received 214.5 million [[Japanese yen|yen]] (about [[US Dollar|US$]]2.27 million) from the Japanese government's [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]], and it distributed most of those funds to studios to train young animators on-the-job during the year. One of the reasons for the support of the Agency for Cultural Affairs is the concern that more of the Japanese animation process is being outsourced overseas—thus leading to a decline in opportunities to teach animation techniques within Japan. In 2011 the Agency once again provided funding for JAniCA to select more young training projects under the same budgets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janica.jp/press/press100428.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janica.jp/11topics.html#jinzaiikusei20100430&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Klecksography''' is the art of making images from [[inkblot]]s.&lt;ref name="Lee1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Lee|title=The Name's Familiar: Mr. Leotard, Barbie, and Chef Boy-Ar-Dee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-tNsbAhFiIC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=1999|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=978-1-4556-0918-5|pages=232–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was pioneered by [[Justinus Kerner]], who included klecksographs in his books of poetry.&lt;ref name="Richardson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=John T. E. Richardson|title=Howard Andrew Knox: Pioneer of Intelligence Testing at Ellis Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=toArWzNbBUAC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51211-4|pages=134–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1890s, [[psychologist]]s have used it as a tool for studying the subconscious, most famously [[Hermann Rorschach]] in his [[Rorschach inkblot test]].

==Method==
Spots of ink are dropped onto a piece of paper and the paper is folded in half, so that the ink will smudge and form a mirror reflection in the two halves. The piece of paper is then unfolded so that the ink can dry, after which someone can guess the resemblance of the print to other objects. The inkblots tend to resemble images because of [[apophenia]], the human tendency to see patterns in nature.&lt;ref name="Geary2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Geary|title=I Is an Other: The Secret Life of Metaphor and How it Shapes the Way We See the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nALGZMTeN1oC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=26 June 2013|date=8 February 2011|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-204177-7|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kerner Kleksographien 07.jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|A page of poetry and art from [[Justinus Kerner]]'s ''Klecksographien'' (1890)]]
Justinus Kerner invented this technique when he started accidentally dropping blots of ink onto paper due to failing eyesight. Instead of throwing them away, he found that intriguing shapes appeared if he unfolded the papers. He elaborated these shapes into intricate cartoons and used them to illustrate his poems. Kerner began a collection of klecksographs and poetry in 1857 titled ''Klecksographien''. His collection was not published until 1890 because of his death in 1862.

In 1896, a similar game was described in the United States by Ruth McEnery Stuart and Albert Bigelow Paine in a book titled ''Gobolinks, or Shadow-Pictures for Young and Old''. The book explained how to make inkblot monsters ("gobolinks") and use them as prompts for writing imaginative verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Book News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q-MRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=1897|pages=143–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in psychology==

===Binet and Henri===
As early as 1895, [[Alfred Binet]] and his associate [[Victor Henri]] first suggested that inkblots might be used in psychological research, arguing that the interpretation of inkblots could be used to study variations in ‘involuntary imagination’.&lt;ref name="Richardson2011"/&gt;

===Rorschach===
As a child in [[Switzerland]], Hermann Rorschach enjoyed klecksography so much that his friends nicknamed him "Klecks", meaning "inkblot".&lt;ref name="Lee1999" /&gt; As a medical student, Rorschach studied under psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]], who had taught [[Carl Jung]]. In studying [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] work on [[Dream_symbolism#Freud|dream symbolism]], Rorschach was reminded of his youthful inkblot hobby. He then created his Rorschach test to see if people's reactions to inkblots could be used as a tool to uncover unconscious desires.&lt;ref name="Lee1999" /&gt; The test is essentially a visual variation on Freud's verbal technique.&lt;ref name="Geary2011" /&gt;

'''Larry John Bissonnette''' (born 1957 in [[Winooski, Vermont]]) is an American [[Autism spectrum|autistic]] artist and activist for [[Autism|autism]] and general disabilities. Bissonnette was diagnosed with multiple other disorders including an [[Intellectual Disability|intellectual disability]] and [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenia]]. Bissonnette's art is found at the [[Collection de l'art brut|Musée de l'Art Brut]] in [[Switzerland]] and multiple private collections.

==Early life==
At age two, Bissonnette suffered from a high fever, which might have caused some kind of damage to his nervous system. By the time he was eight, he was sent to the [[Brandon Training School]], which was Vermont's only institute for the mentally handicapped at the time. During his 10-year confinement at Brandon, he was diagnosed as autistic, schizophrenic, mentally retarded and clinically insane.

During this time, he used concepts of art such as drawing and painting to help himself through self-expression. To him, it's a form of therapy as he was non-verbal since the age of three or four. By the time he was 18, he was then transferred to Vermont Psychiatric Hospital in [[Waterbury, Vermont]], but was soon released by his sister, Sally, who learned about how Larry was physically abused at the institutes, and even receive scars. Bissonnette was then enrolled with an residential program for the developmentally disabled.&lt;ref name="YouTube.com (2012)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ECrXMfHffM|title=Autistic Artist Taboo: Strange Behavior|last=|first=|date=2012-06-15|website=YouTube.com|publisher=YouTube|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRACE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graceart.org/collections/larry-bissonette/|title=Larry Bissonette|last=Jameslov|first=|date=2016-08-24|website=GraceArt.org|publisher=Grass Roots Art and Community Effort (GRACE)|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Larry began communicating for the first time after more than 30 years by typing with an assistive device. Apart from his art, this was another option to express his feelings and thoughts.&lt;ref name="W&amp;J Bissonnette (2011)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wretchesandjabberers.org/bios/larry-bissonnette/|title=Wretches &amp; Jabberers|last=|first=|date=2011-04-01|website=WretchesAndJabberers.org|publisher=State of the Art Inc.|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his years wandering around in public, Larry displayed a threatening appearance which led to some treating him like an outcast, according to Pascal Cheng who is Larry's aid. But, Larry is aware of this after releasing his thoughts through typing.&lt;ref name="W&amp;J Cheng (2011)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wretchesandjabberers.org/bios/pascal-cheng/|title=Wretches &amp; Jabberers|last=|first=|date=2011-04-01|website=WretchesAndJabberers.org|publisher=State of the Art Inc.|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YouTube.com (2013)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku5rYjgbbPg|title=Taboo: Extreme Lives Strange Behaviours - Autism|last=|first=|date=2013-01-21|website=YouTube.com|publisher=YouTube|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning as an public speaker==
In 1998, Larry began his journey as a public speaker at several National Educational Conferences in which he spoken about autism, communication, and art.&lt;ref name="W&amp;J Bissonnette (2011)"/&gt; Despite being nonverbal, Larry uses his assistive-device typing skills to describe what he wishes to say. He says he is aware that everyone viewed and treated him like an outcast which made everyone realize he is the same as everyone else.&lt;ref name="YouTube.com (2012)"/&gt;

In 2010, Larry and another autism-rights speaker, Tracy Thresher, described others treating them as outcasts, and revealed that they are actually capable despite others' beliefs. With assistive devices and encouraging others on the autism spectrum about what they can do, others can learn that they are not freaks, but can reach out not only with words, but with courage to work with others including those who are non-autistic. The two men traveled the world and visited several nations such as Japan and Finland.&lt;ref name="WretchesAndJabberers.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wretchesandjabberers.org/|title=Wretches &amp; Jabberers|last=|first=|date=2011-04-01|website=WretchesAndJabberers.org|publisher=State of the Art Inc.|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
Larry's success in public speaking brought him to the attention of various media. In 2005, Larry starred in his biographical film, ''My Classic Life as an Artist: A Portrait of Larry Bissonnette'', which earned an award.&lt;ref name="W&amp;J Bissonnette (2011)"/&gt; In 2011, Larry and his ally, Tracy, was in a documentary called ''Wretches and Jabberers'', and in 2012, they were both featured in an episode of the National Geographic ''[[Taboo (2002 TV series)|Taboo]]'' television series which was titled "Strange Behavior".

'''''Les Trois Grâces''''' is a set of three public artworks by French-American [[sculptor]] [[Niki de Saint Phalle]]. ''The Three Graces'' are part of the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]] [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]] Sculpture Project.&lt;ref name="FactSheet"&gt;{{cite web | author=National Museum of Women in the Arts | year=2010 | title=Fact Sheet | work=New York Ave Sculpture Project at National Museum of Women in the Arts | publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts | url=http://www.nmwa.org/sculptureproject/files/Sculpture_Project_Fact_Sheet.pdf | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In the classic style of Niki de Saint Phalle's work, ''Les Trois Grâces'' are three large sculptures of [[voluptuous]] women (a creation that de Saint Phalle calls a 'Nana') who appear to be dancing. Made of [[fiberglass]], one Nana is covered in white, one yellow and the other is black [[mosaic]] tiles, ranging in heights of {{convert|12|to|15|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Trescott1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Jacqueline Trescott | title=National Museum of Women in the Arts to turn D.C. corridor into sculpture alley | work=Style | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/23/AR2010022304712.html | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011 | date=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They all wear elaborate [[bathing suits]] in designs such as hearts, fish, and instruments, in multiple color schemes. A whimsical set of sculptures, the three figures have their arms raised as if [[ballet]] dancing; each has one foot on the ground and another raised up. They are Saint Phalle's own version of [[The Three Graces (disambiguation)|The Three Graces]].&lt;ref name="Images"&gt;{{cite web | author=National Museum of Women in the Arts | year=2010 | title=Images | work=New York Ave Sculpture Project at National Museum of Women in the Arts | publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts | url=http://www.nmwa.org/sculptureproject/files/Sculpture_Project_Images.pdf | accessdate=8 Feb 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219155737/http://nmwa.org/sculptureproject/files/Sculpture_Project_Images.pdf | archivedate=2010-12-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Phalle said that the works represented unity among the races.&lt;ref name="Gopnik1"/&gt;

==New York Avenue Sculpture Project==
{{main|National_Museum_of_Women_in_the_Arts#New_York_Avenue_Sculpture_Project}}
''Les Trois Grâces'' are the first of many sculptures being installed for the Project by the National Museum of Women in the Arts. By 2015 a selection of sculptures was to be installed along New York Avenue from 13th Street to 9th Street, in the heart of [[Mount Vernon Square]]. The museum's efforts were in part to bring "character" to an area where "there is a lot of good stuff going on", due to revitalization programs in the neighborhood. Saint Phalle's works, four in total, were the first in a series of installations. The installation of de Saint Phalle's iconic pop art works was intended to contrast with the traditional sculpture that graces the streets and squares of Washington.&lt;ref name="Trescott1"/&gt;

The entire selection of de Saint Phalle's works was removed during the winter for conservation purposes, intended to reappear in the Spring.&lt;ref name="Gopnik1"/&gt; They were to remain up for one year, before being returned to the artist's foundation.&lt;ref name="Gopnik1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Blake Gopnik | title=Sculptures add color to New York Avenue, but are they art? | work=Style | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042703104.html | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011 | date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=July 2017}}

==Dedication==
The works arrived and were installed in mid-April 2010 by way of flat-bed semi-truck. The pieces were removed from their custom crates, handled and installed by hand.&lt;ref name="Strokes"&gt;{{cite web | author=Broad Strokes | year=2010 | title=The Three Graces are HERE! | work= | publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts | url=http://womeninthearts.wordpress.com/2010/04/15/the-three-graces-are-here/ | accessdate= 9 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Les Trois Grâces'', along with the other de Saint Phalle sculptures in the project, were dedicated at 1:30 pm on April 28, 2010., with an evening reception within the museum. [[Dr. Jill Biden]], [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]], [[Jack Evans (DC Council)|Jack Evans]], National Museum of Women in the Arts founder [[Wilhelmina Holladay]] and Saint Phalle's granddaughter [[Bloum Cardenas]], along with members of the DC Business Improvement District, [[District of Columbia Department of Transportation]], DC Office of the Planning, and other guests attended the ribbon cutting.&lt;ref name="FactSheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trescott1"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s [[Jacqueline Trescott]] described ''Les Trois Grâces'' as a "splash of [[pop art]], as exaggerated as Las Vegas [[showgirl]]s".&lt;ref name="Trescott1"/&gt; Fellow ''Post'' writer and [[art critic]] [[Blake Gopnik]] described the pieces as being "less weighty than what we hope to find inside our museums", characterizing them as [[plop art]].&lt;ref name="Gopnik1"/&gt;

The '''''Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints''''' (Young Baptist and Saints Peter, Catherine, Lucy, and Paul),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/classes/finearts/smith/ptg_sculp_nyc/ren/5_6.html]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''''Colonna Altarpiece''''', is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]], c. 1504. It is housed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] of [[New York City]].  It is the only [[altarpiece]] by Raphael in the United States.

The collection of [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] also contains a painting of the ''[[Agony in the Garden]]'' from the [[predella]] of the altarpiece.  Other panels from the predella can be found in the collections of the [[National Gallery, London]], the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]], in Boston, and [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]], in London.  A preparatory drawing by Raphael for the composition of the agony in the garden is in the collection of the [[Morgan Library]] New York.

The pieces of the predella were separated from the altarpiece and sold to [[Queen Christina of Sweden]], from where they reached the [[Orleans Collection]], while the main panels themselves were eventually sold to the aristocratic Colonna family in Rome, from whom the altarpiece takes its name.  The Altarpiece was the last Raphael altar in private hands when [[J.P. Morgan]] purchased it in the early 20th century for a record price.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''sick note''' is a type of medical certificate excusing a student's absence from school for reasons of [[illness]].

==Purpose and applications==
Medical certificates are sometimes required to obtain certain [[Health insurance|health benefits]] from an employer, to make an insurance [[Cause of action|claim]], for tax purposes, or for certain legal procedures. Medical certificates are used to indicate eligibility of activity, such as the use of [[Disabled parking permit|disabled parking]]. Medical certificates can also be used to describe a medical condition a person has, such as blindness. Medical certificates are often used to certify that someone is free of [[Infection|contagious diseases]], [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]], [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], or other health issues.

Health criteria are often required when making an application for something, such as an [[eye examination]] to get a driver's license. Other times medical criteria are presented voluntarily by an applicant in a self-assessment, without either a doctor or access to the person's [[medical record]]. Specific health criteria or medical history are required for certain jobs.

In the United States, most [[Aircraft pilot|aviators]] are required to possess a valid medical certificate that certifies sound health as part of the requirements for piloting an [[airplane]] or [[helicopter]].&lt;ref name="Pilot'sHandbook"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge |last=U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location= |isbn=0160823676 |page=16-2 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0l8WO6Drz50C&amp;pg=SA16-PA2&amp;dq=medical+certificate#v=onepage&amp;q=medical%20certificate&amp;f=false |access-date=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While airman certificates are issued for life, the medical certificate expires and must be renewed periodically in order continue flying privileges.  [[Pilot certification in the United States#Sport pilot|Sport pilots]] may use a valid state driver's license in place of a medical certificate, and [[Glider (aircraft)|glider]] and [[hot air balloon]] pilots are not required to obtain them.&lt;ref name="Pilot'sHandbook" /&gt;

==Aegrotat==
The term ''aegrotat'' (abbreviated as ''aegrot'') is used primarily in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In the context of [[British undergraduate degree classification|British undergraduate degrees]] a student who is too ill to finish may be awarded an aegrotat degree if the student otherwise would have passed exams or other requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vuw.ac.nz/st_services/counselling/appointments/aegrotat-info.aspx A New Zealand university policy on aegrotat degrees]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on occupation==
Except in certain unique circumstances, a holder of a medical certificate in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration may not "act as pilot in command or in any other capacity as a required flight crewmember of an aircraft".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7cg5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22medical+certificate%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22medical%20certificate%22&amp;f=false | title = The Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America | author1 = Staff | first1 = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | pages = 12 | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patient with conditions such as: measles, chicken-pox, hepatitis A, leprosy, typhoid fever, and whooping cough, can return to work immediately after their healing phase or medical tests. Almost always the patient may only be allowed to return to work upon submission of a medical certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1HOA3sCXNkC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;dq=%22medical+certificate%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1sHvUOWGA4aiiAel5oCgCw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22medical%20certificate%22&amp;f=false | title=Manual Of Community Nursing and Communicable Diseases | accessdate=January 11, 2013 | pages=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
Sometimes, there are standards and procedures in place, for workers in a certain field to be eligible to receive a medical certificate. Any airman at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration must give their employees access to the National Driver Register. On top of this, other tests which are required for first-, second- and third-class airmen are: eye, ear/nose/throat/equilibrium, mental, neurologic, and cardiovascular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7cg5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22medical+certificate%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22medical%20certificate%22&amp;f=false | title = The Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America | author1 = Staff | first1 = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | pages = 67 | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The India List and India Office List 1905'' explains that officers on "Long Leave in Europe" must, among other things, provide a medical certificate, which is obtained at the Medical Board of India Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VQTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=%22medical+certificate%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o8HvUK_2GpDBiQfyr4GIDA&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22medical%20certificate%22&amp;f=false | title=The India List and India Office List | accessdate=January 11, 2013 | pages=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Falsification==
As many illnesses can come about suddenly, sometimes the worker will not have enough time to receive a medical certificate, or may be too sick to obtain one. In other cases, the worker may not be bothered to go to the trouble of getting one, or may be lying about their illness and want to falsify a certificate to back up their story to their boss.

There have been discussions regarding whether it is okay to fire someone for submitting a fabricated medical certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mk.com.au/publications/article/sacked-for-submitting-false-medical-certificates-fair | title=Sacked for Submitting False Medical Certificates - Fair? | accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, it is deemed wrong, such as in Australia where a bank officer was dismissed after handing in a forged certificate, which prompted a Fair Work Australia Commissioner to say they had a "continued lack of regard for the truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.vecci.org.au/2012/02/16/employee-sacked-for-creating-false-medical-certificate/ | title=Employee sacked for creating false medical certificate | accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is a WA police officer who was stood down after committing the same offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/officer-stood-down-for-allegedly-forging-medical-certificate-20081218-713y.html | title=Officer stood down for allegedly forging medical certificate| date=December 18, 2008 | accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is not so black and white. In one case, a woman claimed she was "coerced into falsifying [a] medical certificate [which ultimately led to her being fired] because she was 'being bullied and treated unfairly' by two managers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aworkcovervictimsdiary.com/2012/09/sacked-worker-forged-medical-certificate-claimed-nearly-died-way-treated/ | title=Sacked worker forged medical certificate and claimed she nearly died because the way she was treated | accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some companies that sell fake medical certificates. Although the site ''Doctors Note Store'' sells "fake sick notes and medical certificates for workers in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom", they add that the "fakes are for 'novelty use only'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.workplaceinfo.com.au/payroll/leave/ama-warns-over-fake-sick-notes | title=AMA warns over fake sick notes | accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Flinders University, "providing a forged medical certificate" is viewed as academic misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/current-students/policies-procs/rights/important-changes.cfm | title=Important Changes to the University’s Student Policies and Procedures | accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New South Wales, medical professionals who "deliberately issue a false, misleading or inaccurate certificate" can be charged under the Medical Practice Act. This is in response to The New South Wales Medical Board "receiving numerous complaints from employers, insurers, the courts, etc regarding the quality, accuracy and truthfulness of sickness certificates".&lt;ref name="MCP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mcnsw.org.au/page/old-policies/medical-certificates-policy/ | title=Medical Certificates Policy | page = 67 |accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validation==
In order to prove that one's medical certificate is authentic, the following should be done and taken into consideration:&lt;ref name="MCP"/&gt;

* Having it written in legible text, in the doctor's handwriting, and without "abbreviations or medical jargon".
* Should only include facts or observations made by the doctor, and each should be justified.
* Should include the date of appointment, how sick the patient is, the date they can go back to work, be addressed to the recipient of the certificate (boss etc.),
* Should only be for something "observed by the doctor" or "reported by the patient and deemed to be true by the doctor".
* Can be issued after the patient has taken sick leave, but it must include the date of appointment, and the length of time the employee should be out of work for.
* Should consider if the patient can return to work before they have fully healed, but with "altered duties".
* Respect "rights to confidentiality" and consent of patient (sometimes, the reason for sick leave may be personal and the patient may request it taken off the certificate, in which case "it should be made clear to the patient that the information provided on the certificate may not be sufficient to attract sick leave and that an employer has the ultimate right to accept or to reject a certificate".
* Falsifying a medical certificate is a form of fraud.

Consisting of several 20-minute organic waterfall like [[totem pole]] murals echoing the sounds of the crowded streets of Paris. They range between 2 and 7 metres high of moving images that are always the same and yet always different.   It allows viewers to see at the same time thousands of people all together, and one by one as they come closer.

The images have a meaning when you see them from afar but not necessarily the same meaning seen close up and personal.  It also allows you to think of images in terms of not being part of a “movie”.  For instance, like every day life in Paris, with similarities to Vertov’s “Man with a Movie Camera, the murdim Project also captures everyday scenes from daily life in a city.  Only these images are not part of a typical “movie” in that you do not have to sit to look at.  These are in fact images that go far beyond the usual A3, 16 x 9 and other 1080 sizes.  Or, even to think of images that go further than kaleidoscopic [[computer graphics]]. 10 to 20 HDV cameras on each totem.  Totems are stitched together and broadcast on LCD screens, with each camera aiming at a different part of the scene the same way one would shoot in [[panoramic photography]]

Jacques Davis, the artist behind murdim Project uses crowds and nature as his subjects.  Living and working in [[Paris|Paris, France]], Davis worked for 35 years as a photographer doing mostly large slide shows, later with video, and video walls. Be it [[swimming pool]]s, demonstrations, political meetings, markets, and other gatherings as his subjects for the camera, crowds are the main focus.  To view the crowds from afar as a totem, the viewer sees the strength, will and force of a crowd while at the same time one can see close-ups of thousands of very individually unique people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1433">'''Mythical theology''' (''theologica mythica'') is one of three types of [[theology]] defined by the Roman scholar [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] (116&amp;ndash;27 BC) in his lost work ''Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum''. The other two are [[political theology]] (''theologia civilis'') and [[natural theology]] (''theologia naturalis'').

Mythical theology is practiced by story-tellers, especially poets, based on narratives ''([[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythoi]])'' pertaining to divine matters. Divine revelation was claimed or implied by some of these story-tellers, or their disciples.

Theologians of civil or political theology are administrators, defining how the gods relate to daily life and the state (see [[imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|imperial cult]]). Theologians of natural theology are [[philosophy|philosophers]], inquiring into the nature of the gods,
as evidenced by nature and reason.

"Mythical theology" should be distinguished from the ''[[theologia mystica]]'' of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]].

It was produced and distributed internationally by [[Esperanto Filmoj]] and [[Warner Bros.]], while [[Picturehouse (company)|Picturehouse]] handled US distribution rights.

The story takes place in [[Spain]] during the summer of 1944, five years after the [[Spanish Civil War]], during the early [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] period. The narrative intertwines this real world with a mythical world centered on an overgrown, abandoned [[labyrinth]] and a mysterious [[faun]] creature, with whom the main character, Ofelia, interacts. Ofelia's stepfather, the [[Falange|Falangist]] Captain Vidal, hunts the [[Spanish Maquis]] who fight against the Francoist regime in the region, while Ofelia's pregnant mother Carmen grows increasingly ill. Ofelia meets several strange and magical creatures who become central to her story, leading her through the trials of the old labyrinth garden. The film employs make-up, [[animatronics]], and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects to bring life to its creatures.

Del Toro stated that he considers the story to be a [[parable]], influenced by [[fairy tale]]s, and that it addresses and continues themes related to his earlier film ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'' (2001),&lt;ref name="SF"/&gt; to which ''Pan's Labyrinth'' is a [[spiritual successor]], according to del Toro in his [[Audio commentary|director's DVD commentary]]. The original Spanish title refers to the fauns of [[Roman mythology]], while the English, [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]] titles refer specifically to the faun-like [[Greek mythology in western art and literature|Greek deity]] [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. However, del Toro has stated that the faun in the film is not Pan.&lt;ref name="SF"/&gt;

The film premiered at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]. It was released in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2006. In the United States and Canada, the film was given a [[limited release]] on 29 December 2006, with a [[wide release]] on 19 January 2007. ''Pan's Labyrinth'' opened to widespread critical acclaim. The film won numerous international awards, including three [[Academy Awards]], three [[BAFTA Award]]s including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Film Not in the English Language]], the [[Ariel Award for Best Picture]], the [[Saturn Awards]] for [[Saturn Award for Best International Film|Best International Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor|Best Performance by a Younger Actor]] for [[Ivana Baquero]] and the 2007 [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation#Long Form|Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form]].

&lt;!--

1. This is a synopsis; try to keep it as short as possible. Tiny details don't need to be added.
2. The spoiler warning is no longer used on Wikipedia.
--&gt;
In a [[fairy tale]], Princess Moanna, whose father is the king of the [[underworld]], visits the human world, where the sunlight blinds her and erases her memory. She becomes mortal and dies. The king believes that eventually, her [[spirit]] will return to the underworld, so he builds labyrinths (which act as portals) around the world in preparation for her return.

In 1944 [[Francoist Spain]], protagonist Ofelia travels with her pregnant but sickly mother Carmen to meet Captain Vidal, her new stepfather. Vidal, the son of a famed commander who died in [[Morocco]], believes strongly in [[Falangism]] and has been assigned to hunt down [[Spanish maquis|republican rebels]].

A large [[stick insect]], which Ofelia believes to be a [[fairy]], leads Ofelia into an ancient stone [[labyrinth]], but she is stopped by Vidal's housekeeper Mercedes, who is secretly supporting her brother Pedro and other rebels. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia's bedroom, where it transforms to a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets the [[faun]], who believes she is the [[reincarnation]] of Princess Moanna. He gives her three tasks to complete in order for her to acquire [[immortality]] and return to her kingdom. Meanwhile, Vidal murders two local farmers detained (erroneously) on suspicion of helping the rebels.

Ofelia completes the first task — retrieving a key from the belly of a giant [[toad]] — but becomes worried about her mother, whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a [[Mandrake|mandrake root]], which seems to ease Carmen's illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides, Ofelia then completes the second task—retrieving a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster. Although she was warned not to consume anything there, she eats two grapes, awakening the Pale Man. He eats two of the fairies and chases Ofelia, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give Ofelia the third task.

Vidal interrogates and tortures a captive rebel. He asks Doctor Ferreiro to tend to the captive, whom Ferreiro [[Euthanasia|euthanizes]] instead. Vidal realizes that Ferreiro is a rebel collaborator and kills him. Simultaneously, Vidal catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root, which he considers delusional. Carmen agrees and throws the root into the fire. She immediately develops painful contractions and [[Maternal death|dies giving birth]] to a son. 

Vidal discovers that Mercedes is also a spy. Mercedes and Ofelia secretly leave but are caught. Ofelia, mistaken as a traitor, is locked in her bedroom, while Mercedes is taken to be interrogated and tortured. Mercedes frees herself, stabs Vidal, and rejoins the rebels. The faun returns to Ofelia to give her a chance for the third task and tells her to bring her baby brother into the labyrinth. Ofelia complies and Vidal pursues her as the rebels launch an attack on the outpost.

Ofelia meets the faun at the center of the labyrinth. The faun suggests drawing a few drops of the baby's blood, as completing the third task and opening the [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] to the underworld requires the blood of an innocent. Ofelia refuses to harm her brother. Vidal finds Ofelia talking to the faun, whom he cannot see. The faun leaves, and Vidal takes the baby from Ofelia's arms before shooting her.

Vidal returns to the labyrinth's entrance, where he is met by the rebels. Knowing that he will be killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, demanding that she tell his son the exact time of his father's death. Mercedes says that the child will not even know his father's name, and Pedro shoots and kills Vidal.

Mercedes enters the labyrinth and comforts a motionless but breathing Ofelia. Drops of Ofelia's blood fall down the center of the spiral stone staircase onto an [[altar]]. Ofelia, well dressed and uninjured, then appears in a golden throne room. The king of the underworld says that she passed the real final test, which was to choose to spill her own blood rather than that of an innocent. The faun praises Ofelia for her choice, and addresses her as "Her Majesty". The queen of the underworld, her mother, invites Ofelia/Moanna to sit next to her father, and rule at his side. Back in the stone labyrinth (in the real world), Ofelia smiles as she dies.

The epilogue completes the tale of Princess Moanna, stating that she ruled wisely and left quiet traces of her time in the human realm "visible only to those who know where to look."

==Cast==
* [[Ivana Baquero]] as Ofelia&lt;!-- THIS IS THE CORRECT SPANISH SPELLING, NOT OPHELIA--&gt; / Princess Moanna, a child who comes to believe she is the reincarnation of a princess from the underworld. Del Toro said he was nervous about casting the lead role, and that finding the 10-year-old Spanish actress was purely accidental. (The film was shot from June–October 2005, when she was 11.) "The character I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9, and Ivana came in and she was a little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first reading, my wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age."&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/deltoro.php |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090705114644/http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/deltoro.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 July 2009 |title=Exclusive Interview: Guillermo del Toro "''Pan's Labyrinth''" |accessdate=28 January 2007 |date=26 September 2006 |publisher=Dark Horizons |last=Fischer |first=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baquero says that Del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairy tales to help her "get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt". She says she thought the film was "marvelous", and that "at the same time it can bring you pain, and sadness, and scariness, and happiness".&lt;ref name=SF/&gt;
* [[Sergi López i Ayats|Sergi López]] as Captain Vidal, Ofelia's new stepfather and a [[Falange]] officer. Del Toro met with López in [[Barcelona]], a year and a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. In parts of Spain, López was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the Madrid-based producers told Del Toro, "You should be very careful because you don't know about these things because you're Mexican, but this guy is not going to be able to deliver the performance"; del Toro replied "Well, it's not that I don't know, it's that I don't care".&lt;ref name=oscarwatch&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/pans-labyrinth-a-story-that-needed-guillermo-del-toro/ |title=Pan's Labyrinth: A Story that Needed Guillermo Del Toro |accessdate=2 January 2018 |date=11 January 2007 |website=[[Awards Daily]] |last=Stone |first=Sasha |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126100819/http://www.oscarwatch.com/2007/01/pans_labyrinth_a_story_that.html |archivedate=26 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of his character, López said: "He is the most evil character I've ever played in my career. It is impossible to improve upon it; the character is so solid and so well written. Vidal is deranged, a psychopath who is impossible to defend. Even though his father's personality marked his existence—and is certainly one of the reasons for his mental disorder—that cannot be an excuse. It would seem to be very cynical to use that to justify or explain his cruel and cowardly acts. I think it is great that the film does not consider any justification of fascism."
* [[Maribel Verdú]] as Mercedes, Vidal's housekeeper. Del Toro selected Verdú to play the compassionate revolutionary because he "saw a sadness in her which he thought would be perfect for the part".&lt;ref name="oscarwatch"/&gt;
* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as the Faun and the Pale Man. As the Faun, Jones guides Ofelia to the fantasy world. As the Pale Man, he plays a grotesque monster with an appetite for children. Jones had previously worked with del Toro on ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' and ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]'', and said the director sent him an email saying, "You must be in this film. No one else can play this part but you." Jones responded enthusiastically to an English translation of the script, but then found out the film was in Spanish, which he did not speak. Jones says he was "terrified" and del Toro suggested learning the script phonetically, but Jones rejected this, preferring to learn the words himself. He said, "I really, really buckled down and committed myself to learning that word for word and I got the pronunciation semi-right before I even went in," using the five hours a day he spent getting the costume and make-up on to practice the words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canmag.com/news/4/3/6216|title=Doug Jones En Espanol|accessdate=27 January 2007|date=27 December 2006|publisher=CanMag|last=Topel|first=Fred}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Toro later decided to dub Jones with the voice of Pablo Adán, "an authoritative theatre actor", but Jones's efforts remained valuable because the voice actor was able to match his delivery with Jones's mouth movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/article/labyrinth-s-faun-unmasked|title=Labyrinth's faun unmasked |accessdate=11 May 2016 |date=11 May 2016 |publisher=straight.com|last=Eisner|first=Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones's dual casting is intended to suggest that the Pale Man (along with the toad) is either a creation of the Faun,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/31208|title=Capone chats with Abe Sapien, The Faun, The Old Man and The Silver Surfer!!!

==Production==

===Influences===
The idea for ''Pan's Labyrinth'' came from [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s notebooks, which he says are filled with "doodles, ideas, drawings and plot bits". He had been keeping these notebooks for twenty years. At one point during production, he left the notebook in a taxi in [[London]] and was distraught, but the cabbie returned it to him two days later. Though he originally wrote a story about a pregnant woman who falls in love with a faun,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=film&amp;article=288|accessdate=20 July 2007|title=The world of the labyrinth|publisher=Bay Area Reporte |date=4 January 2007|last=Lamble|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergi López said that del Toro described the final version of the plot a year and a half before filming. Lopez said that "for two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written'". López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he said that "it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canmag.com/nw/6255-sergi-lopez-pans-labyrinth-interview|title=Sergi Lopez on ''Pan's Labyrinth''|accessdate=27 January 2007|date=2 January 2007|publisher=CanMag|last=Topel|first=Fred}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Del Toro got the idea of the faun from childhood experiences with "[[lucid dream]]ing". He stated on ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|The Charlie Rose Show]]'' that every midnight, he would wake up, and a faun would gradually step out from behind the grandfather's clock.&lt;ref&gt;''Pan's Labyrinth'' DVD, U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the faun was supposed to be a classic half-man, half-goat faun fraught with beauty. But in the end, the faun was altered into a goat-faced creature almost completely made out of earth, moss, vines, and tree bark. He became a mysterious, semi-suspicious relic who gave both the impression of trustworthiness and many signs that warn someone to never confide in him at all.

Del Toro has said the film has strong connections in theme to ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'' and should be seen as an informal sequel dealing with some of the issues raised there. Fernando Tielve and Íñigo Garcés, who played the protagonists of ''The Devil's Backbone'', make cameo appearances as unnamed guerrilla soldiers in ''Pan's Labyrinth''. Some of the other works he drew on for inspiration include [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''Alice'' books, [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''[[Ficciones]]'', [[Arthur Machen]]'s ''[[The Great God Pan]]'' and ''[[The White People]]'', [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]]'s ''The Blessing of Pan'', [[Algernon Blackwood]]'s ''Pan's Garden'' and [[Francisco Goya]]'s works. In 2004, del Toro said: "''Pan'' is an original story. Some of my favourite writers (Borges, Blackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god Pan and the symbol of the labyrinth. These are things that I find very compelling and I am trying to mix them and play with them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deltorofilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=28#28 Del Toro message board, Answers Archive Wed Nov 24, 2004 1:27 am] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927050559/http://www.deltorofilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=28 |date=27 September 2007 }}, repost from elsewhere; Retrieved on 20 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also influenced by the illustrations of [[Arthur Rackham]].&lt;ref name="panspeople"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1949245,00.html|title=Pan's people|date=17 November 2006|accessdate=9 July 2007|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|first=Guillermo|last=del Toro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Del Toro wanted to include a fairy tale about a dragon for Ofelia to narrate to her unborn brother. The tale involved the dragon, named Varanium Silex, who guarded a mountain surrounded by thorns, but at its peak is a blue rose that can grant immortality. The dragon and the thorns ward off many men though, who decide it is better to avoid pain than to be given immortality. Although the scene was thematically important, it was cut short for budget reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Guillermo del Toro]] |title=Svnt Dracones |publisher=[[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]]'s official website |date=15 October 2008 |url=http://www.john-howe.com/blog/2008/10/16/forging-more-dragons/ |accessdate=15 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503160317/http://www.john-howe.com/blog/2008/10/16/forging-more-dragons/ |archivedate=3 May 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are differing ideas about the film's religious influences. Del Toro himself has said that he considers ''Pan's Labyrinth'' "a truly profane film, a layman's riff on Catholic dogma", but that his friend [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]] described it as "a truly Catholic film". Del Toro's explanation is "once a Catholic, always a Catholic," however he also admits that the Pale Man's preference for children rather than the feast in front of him is intended as a criticism of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=panspeople/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guillermo Del Toro, Pan's Labyrinth: Inside the Creation of a Modern Fairy Tale (Harper Design, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the priest's words during the torture scene were taken as a direct quote from a priest who offered communion to political prisoners during the Spanish Civil War: "Remember my sons, you should confess what you know because God doesn't care what happens to your bodies; He already saved your souls."&lt;ref&gt;Guillermo Del Toro, Pan's Labyrinth: Inside the Creation of a Modern Fairy Tale (Harper Design, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersecting.weebly.com/blog/pans-labyrinth-2006|title=Pan's Labyrinth|website=Intersecting|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to whether or not the fantasy underworld was real or a product of Ofelia's imagination, del Toro stated in an interview that, while he believes it is real, the movie "should tell something different to everyone. It should be a matter of personal discussion". He then mentioned there were several clues in the movie indicating the underworld was indeed real.&lt;ref name=pansinterview/&gt;

The film was shot in a [[Scots pine|Scots Pine]] forest situated in the [[Sierra de Guadarrama|Guadarrama mountain range]], Central [[Spain]]. [[Guillermo Navarro]], the [[Cinematographer|director of photography]], said that "after doing work in Hollywood on other movies and with other directors, working in our original language in different scenery brings me back to the original reasons I wanted to make movies, which is basically to tell stories with complete freedom and to let the visuals really contribute to the telling of the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/January2007/PansLabyrinth/page1.php |title=Fear and Fantasy |accessdate=17 June 2007 |date=January 2007 |publisher=[[American Cinematographer]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070511033220/http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/January2007/PansLabyrinth/page1.php |archivedate=11 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pale man's eyes on his hands is a feature shared by the Japanese mythological monster the [[Tenome]]. Te-no-me means "eyes on hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scaryforkids.com/pale-man/ |title=Pale Man |date=11 May 2008 |website=ScaryForKids.Com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706160657/http://www.scaryforkids.com/pale-man |archivedate=6 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
''Pan's Labyrinth'' employs some [[computer-generated imagery]] in its effects, but mostly uses complex make-up and [[animatronics]]. The giant toad was inspired by ''[[The Maze (1953 film)|The Maze]]''. Del Toro himself performed the noises. The mandrake root is a combination of animatronics and CGI. Del Toro wanted the fairies "to look like little monkeys, like dirty fairies", but the animation company had the idea to give them wings made of leaves.&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-01-02-pans-labyrinth-main_x.htm|accessdate=20 July 2007|date=14 March 2007|title=Surprises lurk inside ''Pan's Labyrinth''|work=[[USA Today]]|last=Wloszczyna |first=Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones spent an average of five hours sitting in the makeup chair as his team of [[David Martí]], [[Montse Ribé]] and Xavi Bastida applied the makeup for the Faun, which was mostly [[latex]] foam. The last piece to be applied was the pair of horns, which weighed ten pounds and were extremely tiring to wear. The legs were a unique design, with Jones standing on 20-cm-high lifts (8 in), and the legs of the Faun attached to his own. His lower leg was eventually digitally erased in post production. Servos in the head flapped the Faun's ears and blinked the eyes, and were remotely operated by David Martí and Xavi Bastida from DDT {{Not a typo|Efectos}} Especiales while on set. Del Toro told Jones to "go rock star&amp;nbsp;... like a glam rocker. But less [[David Bowie]], more [[Mick Jagger]]".&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt;

The Captain's room, as shown in the scene where Captain Vidal is shaving, is supposed to resemble his father's watch, which del Toro says represents his troubled mind.

A bout of weight loss on Del Toro's part inspired the physical appearance of the saggy-skinned Pale Man.&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Gilbert.

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. 5 September 2011. page 80.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to see while performing the part, Doug Jones had to look out of the character's nostrils, and its legs were attached to the front of the green leotard which Jones wore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chud.com/index.php?type=interviews&amp;id=8772|accessdate=20 July 2007|title=INTERVIEW: DOUG JONES (PAN'S LABYRINTH)|date=18 February 2007 |last=Fischer|first=Russ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subtitles===
The film uses subtitles for its translation into other languages, including English. Del Toro wrote them himself, because he was disappointed with the subtitles of his previous Spanish film, ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]''. In an interview, he said that they were "for the thinking impaired" and "incredibly bad". He spent a month working with two other people, and said that he did not want it to "feel like... watching a subtitled film".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/labyrinth%20director%20wrote%20his%20own%20subtitles_1021894 Guillermo Del Toro - Labyrinth Director Wrote His Own Subtitles]", contactmusic.com, 13 February 2007.

Some reviewers had criticisms. For ''[[U-T San Diego|The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'', David Elliott said "the excitement is tangible", but added that "what it lacks is successful unity&amp;nbsp;...

===Comparisons to other films===
====Spanish films====
Del Toro himself has indicated similarities with ''[[The Spirit of the Beehive]]'', filmed in Francoist Spain, which juxtaposes issues related to the Civil War with horror film.&lt;ref name=timeout/&gt;&lt;ref name=outsidetheframe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thephoenix.com/OutsideTheFrame/PermaLink.aspx?guid=8ae649e6-a17f-478b-993a-a6f0f791a936 |title=Outside The Frame: Guillermo Del Toro Interview Part 1 |accessdate=28 January 2007 |date=11 January 2007 |publisher=ThePhoenix.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119233841/http://thephoenix.com/OutsideTheFrame/PermaLink.aspx?guid=8ae649e6-a17f-478b-993a-a6f0f791a936 |archivedate=19 January 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At least one critic has made a connection to a second Spanish film, ''[[Cría Cuervos]]'' (1975, Saura), again made while Franco was still in power. Doug Cummings (Film Journey 2007) identifies the connection between ''Cria Cuervos'', ''Spirit of the Beehive'' and ''Pan's Labyrinth'': "Critics have been summarily referencing ''Spirit of the Beehive'' (1973) in reviews of ''Pan's Labyrinth'', but Saura's film–at once a sister work to Erice's classic in theme, tone, even shared actress ([[Ana Torrent]])–is no less rich a reference point."&lt;ref name="film journey"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cummings |first=Doug |title=Cria cuervos |url=http://www.filmjourney.org/2007/03/31/cria-cuervos/#more-619 |archive-date=14 April 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414182044/http://www.filmjourney.org/2007/03/31/cria-cuervos/%23more-619#more-619 |dead-url=yes|work=Film Journey |accessdate=23 August 2010 |date=31 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-Spanish films====
In a 2007 interview, del Toro noted the striking similarities between his film and [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|The Chronicles of Narnia]]'': both films are set around the same time, have similar child-age principal characters, mythic creatures (particularly the fauns), and themes of "disobedience and choice". Says del Toro: "This is my version of that universe, not only 'Narnia', but that universe of children's literature."&lt;ref name=del-toro-narnia&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.starbeacon.com/heat/local_story_363121523 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120911011135/http://www.starbeacon.com/heat/local_story_363121523 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 September 2012 |title=Del Toro crafts a harrowing fairy tale |accessdate=28 March 2007 |date=29 December 2006 |publisher=[[Star Beacon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, del Toro was asked to direct ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' but turned it down for ''Pan's Labyrinth''.&lt;ref name=del-toro-narnia/&gt;
In addition to ''Narnia'', ''Pan's Labyrinth'' has also been compared to films such as ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'', ''[[MirrorMask]]'', ''[[Spirited Away]]'' and ''[[Bridge to Terabithia (2007 film)|Bridge to Terabithia]]''.&lt;ref name=timeout&gt;{{cite web|first=Ben|last=Walters|date=21–28 November 2006|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/83674.html|title=Pan's Labyrinth Film Review|work= [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |accessdate=24 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canmag.com/nw/6778-bridge-terabithia-review|title=Bridge to Terabithia a Pan's Labyrinth for Kids|accessdate=23 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Opera House (ROH)''' is an [[opera house]] and major performing arts venue in [[Covent Garden]], [[central London]]. The large building is often referred to as simply '''"Covent Garden"''', after a previous use of the site of the opera house's original construction in 1732.  It is the home of [[The Royal Opera]], [[The Royal Ballet]], and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House. Originally called the '''Theatre Royal''', it served primarily as a playhouse for the first hundred years of its history. In 1734, the first ballet was presented. A year later, [[Handel]]'s first season of operas began. Many of his operas and [[oratorio]]s were specifically written for Covent Garden and had their premieres there.

The current building is the third theatre on the site following disastrous fires in 1808 and 1856. The façade, [[foyer]], and [[auditorium]] date from 1858, but almost every other element of the present complex dates from an extensive reconstruction in the 1990s. The main auditorium seats 2,256 people, making it the third largest in London, and consists of four tiers of [[box (theatre)|box]]es and [[balcony|balconies]] and the [[amphitheatre]] gallery. The [[proscenium]] is 12.20 m wide and 14.80 m high. The main auditorium is a Grade I [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/443-royal-opera-house-london "Royal Opera House (London)"] description on theatrestrust.org.uk Retrieved 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Davenant Patent==
[[Image:Rich-Covent-Garden.jpg|thumb|"Rich's Glory": John Rich seemingly invades his new Covent Garden Theatre. (caricature by [[William Hogarth]])]]
The foundation of the '''Theatre Royal, Covent Garden''' lies in the [[letters patent]] awarded by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to Sir [[William Davenant]] in 1662, allowing Davenant to operate one of only two [[patent theatre]] companies (''The [[Duke's Company]]'') in London. The letters patent remained in the possession of the patentees' heirs until the 19th century; their whereabouts are currently unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol35/pp1-8#h3-0004 'The Killigrew and Davenant patents'  ''Survey of London'' vol. 35 pp 1-8.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first theatre==
[[Image:Covert Garden Theatre edited.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of the first theatre before it burned down in 1808]]
In 1728, [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]], actor-manager of the Duke's Company at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] Theatre, commissioned ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' from [[John Gay]]. The success of this venture provided him with the capital to build the Theatre Royal (designed by [[Edward Shepherd]]) at the site of an ancient convent garden, part of which had been developed by [[Inigo Jones]] in the 1630s with a piazza and church.  In addition, a Royal Charter had created a fruit and vegetable market in the area, a market which survived in that location until 1974. At its opening on 7 December 1732, Rich was carried by his actors in processional triumph into the theatre for its opening production of [[William Congreve]]'s ''[[The Way of the World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Admission to the 55 boxes was 5 shillings (1/4 [[Pound sterling|£]]), half a crown (1/8 £) to the 'pit', and the gallery cost one shilling (1/20 £). A seat on the stage cost ten shillings. It was allowed to send servants to arrive at three to save places on the stage for their masters and mistresses. £115 was taken at the box office on the first night.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first hundred years or so of its history, the theatre was primarily a playhouse, with the Letters Patent granted by Charles II giving Covent Garden and [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] exclusive rights to present spoken drama in London. Despite the frequent interchangeability between the Covent Garden and Drury Lane companies, competition was intense, often presenting the same plays at the same time. Rich introduced [[pantomime]] to the repertoire, himself performing (under the stage name ''John Lun'', as [[Harlequin]]) and a tradition of seasonal pantomime continued at the modern theatre, until 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/collections/object.php?object_id=285&amp;ter=true&amp;ter_id=83&amp;back=%2Fcollec ''John Rich as Harlequin'']{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PeoplePlayUK – Theatre Museum) accessed 22 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1734, Covent Garden presented its first ballet, ''Pygmalion''.  [[Marie Sallé]] discarded tradition and her corset and danced in diaphanous robes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/yiannis/dance/history.html ''Early ballet history''] (North Eastern University) accessed 22 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Frideric Handel]] was named musical director of the company, at Lincoln's Inn Fields, in 1719, but his first season of opera, at Covent Garden, was not presented until 1734. His first opera was ''[[Il pastor fido]]'' followed by ''[[Ariodante]]'' (1735), the première of ''[[Alcina]]'', and ''[[Atalanta (opera)|Atalanta]]'' the following year. There was a royal performance of ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' in 1743, which was a success and began a tradition of [[Lent]]en oratorio performances. From 1735 until his death in 1759 he gave regular seasons there, and many of his operas and oratorios were written for Covent Garden or had their first London performances there. He bequeathed his organ to John Rich, and it was placed in a prominent position on the stage, but was among many valuable items lost in a fire that destroyed the theatre on 20 September 1808. In 1792&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; the architect [[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]] rebuilt the auditorium, within the existing shell of the building but deeper and wider than the old auditorium, thus increasing capacity.

==The second theatre==

[[Image:New Covent Garden Theatre Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|upright|1810 illustration of the auditorium of the second theatre]]
[[Image:Joseph Grimaldi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Joseph Grimaldi]], as [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]]]]
Rebuilding began in December 1808, and the second Theatre Royal, Covent Garden (designed by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]]) opened on 18 September 1809 with a performance of ''[[Macbeth]]'' followed by a musical entertainment called ''The Quaker''. The actor-manager [[John Philip Kemble]], raised seat prices to help recoup the cost of rebuilding and the cost of an increased ground rent introduced by the landowner, the Duke of Bedford, but the move was so unpopular that audiences disrupted performances by beating sticks, hissing, booing and dancing. The ''[[OP Riots|Old Price Riots]]'' lasted over two months, and the management was finally forced to accede to the audience's demands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/19th_century/victorian_riots.php ''The Old Price Riots''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531162120/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/19th_century/victorian_riots.php |date=31 May 2008 }} (PeoplePlayUK – the Theatre Museum (at the [[V &amp; A]]) accessed 1 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, entertainments were varied; opera and ballet were presented, but not exclusively. Kemble engaged a variety of acts, including the child performer ''[[Master Betty]]''; the great [[clown]] [[Joseph Grimaldi]] made his name at Covent Garden. Many famous actors of the day appeared at the theatre, including the tragediennes [[Sarah Siddons]] and [[Eliza O'Neill]], the [[Shakespeare]]an actors [[William Charles Macready]], [[Edmund Kean]] and his son [[Charles Kean|Charles]]. On 25 March 1833 Edmund Kean collapsed on stage while playing [[Othello]], and died two months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/318/000102012/ Edmund Kean (1789–1833)] (NNDB) accessed 22 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806, the [[pantomime]] clown Joseph Grimaldi (''The Garrick of Clowns'') had performed his greatest success in ''[[Mother Goose|Harlequin and Mother Goose; or the Golden Egg]]'' at Covent Garden, and this was subsequently revived, at the new theatre. Grimaldi was an innovator: his performance as ''Joey'' introduced the clown to the world, building on the existing role of [[Harlequin]] derived from the ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]''. His father had been ballet-master at Drury Lane, and his physical comedy, his ability to invent visual [[Magic (illusion)|tricks]] and [[buffoon]]ery, and his ability to poke fun at the audience were extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/pantomime_tour/early_pantomime/grimaldi.php ''Early Pantomime''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505042950/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/pantomime_tour/early_pantomime/grimaldi.php |date=5 May 2008 }} (PeoplePlayUK – the Theatre Museum (at the [[V &amp; A]]) accessed 22 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early pantomimes were performed as [[mime]]s accompanied by music, but as [[Music hall]] became popular, Grimaldi introduced the [[pantomime dame]] to the theatre and was responsible for the tradition of audience singing. By 1821 dance and clowning had taken such a physical toll on Grimaldi that he could barely walk, and he retired from the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/MemoirsOfJosephGrimaldi  "Boz" (ed.) ([[Charles Dickens]]), ''Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi'', 1853 edition with Notes and Additions by [[Charles Whitehead]], accessed 22 February 2007].&lt;/ref&gt; By 1828, he was penniless; Drury Lane held a benefit concert for him after Covent Garden refused.&lt;ref&gt;Arundell, Dennis, ''The Story of Sadler's Wells''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An Apology To The Town, For Himself And The Bottle.png|thumb|left|upright|''Harlequin's escape into the bottle'' (print)]]
In 1817, bare flame gaslight had replaced the former candles and oil lamps that lighted the Covent Garden stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatres Compete in Race to Install Gas Illumination – 1817|url=http://www.overthefootlights.co.uk/1817-18.pdf|work=Over The Footlights|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an improvement, but in 1837 Macready employed [[limelight]] in the theatre for the first time, during a performance of a pantomime, ''Peeping Tom of Coventry''. Limelight used a block of [[quicklime]] heated by an oxygen and hydrogen flame. This allowed the use of spotlights to highlight performers on the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, p. 1026&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Theatres Act 1843]] broke the patent theatres' monopoly of drama. At that time [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in the Haymarket was the main centre of ballet and opera but after a dispute with the management in 1846 [[Michael Costa (conductor)|Michael Costa]], conductor at Her Majesty's, transferred his allegiance to Covent Garden, bringing most of the company with him. The auditorium was completely remodeled after an 1846 fire, during the following 1846–47 seasons, the company performed at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"Madame Parepa-Rosa", ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 7 February 1874, p. 129; and Obituary: "Madame Parepa Rosa", ''The Times'', 23 January 1874, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre reopened as the '''Royal Italian Opera''' on 6 April 1847 with a performance of [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[Semiramide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roh.org.uk/about/royal-opera-house/history/ History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407064033/http://www.roh.org.uk/about/royal-opera-house/history |date=7 April 2014 }} (Royal Opera House) accessed 18 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852, [[Louis Antoine Jullien]] the French eccentric composer of light music and conductor presented an opera of his own composition, ''Pietro il Grande''. Five performances were given of the 'spectacular', including live horses on the stage and very loud music. Critics considered it a complete failure and Jullien was ruined and fled to America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://louisjullien.site.voila.fr ''Louis-Antoine Jullien'' (in French)] accessed 21 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Jullien, Louis Antoine |volume=15 |page=551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa and his successors presented all operas in Italian, even those originally written in French, German or English, until 1892, when [[Gustav Mahler]] presented the debut of Wagner's [[Ring cycle]] at Covent Garden.{{sfn|Parker|1900|p=39}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton Seidl]] had conducted the very first Ring in England (sung in German) at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] from 5–9 May 1882.

==The third theatre==
On 5 March 1856, the theatre was again destroyed by fire. Work on the third theatre, designed by [[Edward Middleton Barry]], started in 1857 and the new building, which still remains as the nucleus of the present theatre, was built by [[Lucas Brothers (company)|Lucas Brothers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/49439 |title=Charles Thomas Lucas at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxforddnb.com |date= |accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened on 15 May 1858 with a performance of [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer's]] ''[[Les Huguenots]]''.

The Royal English Opera company under the management of [[Louisa Pyne]] and [[William Harrison (singer)|William Harrison]], made their last performance at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] on 11 December 1858 and took up residence at the theatre on 20 December 1858 with a performance of [[Michael Balfe]]'s ''Satanella''&lt;ref&gt;''Reviews'', "Drury-Lane Theatre", [[The Times]]'', 13 December 1858, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued at the theatre until 1864.

The theatre became the '''Royal Opera House''' (ROH) in 1892, and the number of French and German works offered increased. Winter and summer seasons of opera and ballet were given, and the building was also used for pantomime, recitals and political meetings.

During the [[First World War]], the theatre was requisitioned by the Ministry of Works for use as a furniture repository.

From 1934 to 1936, [[Geoffrey Toye]] was managing director, working alongside the Artistic Director, [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]].  Despite early successes, Toye and Beecham eventually fell out, and Toye resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]] the ROH became a dance hall. There was a possibility that it would remain so after the war but, following lengthy negotiations, the music publishers [[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] acquired the lease of the building. [[David Webster (opera manager)|David Webster]] was appointed General Administrator, and [[Sadler's Wells Ballet]] was invited to become the resident ballet company.  The Covent Garden Opera Trust was created and laid out plans "to establish Covent Garden as the national centre of opera and ballet, employing British artists in all departments, wherever that is consistent with the maintenance of the best possible standards&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Opera House reopened on 20 February 1946 with a performance of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' in an extravagant new production designed by [[Oliver Messel]]. Webster, with his music director [[Karl Rankl]], immediately began to build a resident company. In December 1946, they shared their first production, [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]'s ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'', with the ballet company. On 14 January 1947, the Covent Garden Opera Company gave its first performance of [[Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]''.

Before the grand opening, the Royal Opera House presented one of the Robert Mayer Children's concerts on Saturday, 9 February 1946.

==Reconstruction from the 1980s forward==
[[File:Royal Opera House at night.jpg|thumb|left|The Royal Opera House, Bow Street Façade, after reconstruction]]

Several renovations had taken place to parts of the house in the 1960s, including improvements to the amphitheatre but the theatre clearly needed a major overhaul. In 1975 the Labour government gave land adjacent to the Royal Opera House for a long-overdue modernisation, refurbishment, and extension. In the early 1980s the first part of a major renovation included an extension to the rear of the theatre on the James Street corner. The development added two new ballet studios, offices, a Chorus Rehearsal Room and the Opera Rehearsal room. Dressing rooms were also added.

By 1995, sufficient funds from the Arts Lottery through [[Arts Council England]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/media/uploads/documents/publications/annualreview0504_php4iC12j.rtf ''Arts Council England annual review 2005'', part 4 of 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904115441/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/media/uploads/documents/publications/annualreview0504_php4iC12j.rtf |date=4 September 2012 }} on artscouncil.org.uk Retrieved 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and private fundraising had been raised to enable the company to embark upon a major £213&amp;nbsp;million reconstruction of the building by [[Carillion]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carillionplc.com/sectors/sectors_leisure_opera.asp Royal Opera House case study on carillionplc.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104225125/http://carillionplc.com/sectors/sectors_leisure_opera.asp |date=4 January 2010 }} Retrieved 24 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; which took place between 1997 and 1999, under the chairmanship of [[Angus Stirling|Sir Angus Stirling]]. This involved the demolition of almost the whole site including several adjacent buildings to make room for a major increase in the size of the complex. The auditorium itself remained, but well over half of the complex is new.

The design team was led by Jeremy Dixon and [[Edward Jones (English architect)|Edward Jones]] of Dixon Jones [[Building Design Partnership|BDP]] as architects. The acoustic designers were Rob Harris and Jeremy Newton of Arup Acoustics. The building engineer was [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] with Stanhope as developer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanhopeplc.com/?page=21&amp;id=236  Stanhope company website] on stanhopeplc.com Retrieved 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Floral Street, Covent Garden - geograph.org.uk - 1550247.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sky bridge connects the [[Royal Ballet School]] (left) to the Royal Opera House (right) on the 4th floor. The bridge was designed by [[Wilkinson Eyre Architects]]]]
 
The new building has the same traditional horseshoe-shaped auditorium as before, but with greatly improved technical, rehearsal, office, and educational facilities. Additionally, a new studio theatre, the Linbury, as well as more public space was created. The inclusion of the adjacent old Floral Hall, which had fallen into disrepair and was used as a scenery store before redevelopment, created a new and extensive public gathering place. The venue is now claimed by the ROH to be the most modern theatre facility in Europe.

[[Surtitle]]s, projected onto a screen above the proscenium, have been used for all opera performances since they were introduced for schools matinees in 1984. Since the reopening of the theatre in 1999 an [[Electronic libretto|electronic libretto system]] provides translations onto small video screens for some seats, and additional monitors and screens are to be introduced to other parts of the house.

In 2014 design work, known as the Open Up Project, began with the aim of improving the entrances, lobby areas and the Linbury Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architectnews.co.uk/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=396:royal-opera-house-launches-open-up-project-with-architects&amp;Itemid=90 "Royal Opera House launches 'Open Up' project with architects"], on architectnews.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Hopkirk, [http://www.building.co.uk/stanton-williams-unveils-%C2%A337m-royal-opera-house-revamp/5071884.article "Stanton Williams unveils £37m Royal Opera House revamp"], 3 November 2014, on architectnews.co.uk.

The Paul Hamlyn Hall is a large iron and glass structure adjacent to, and with direct access to, the main opera house building. The hall now acts as the atrium and main public area of the opera house, with a champagne bar, restaurant and other hospitality services, and also providing access to the main auditorium at all levels.

The redevelopment of the Floral Hall went ahead on the strength of a pledge of £10m from the philanthropist [[Alberto Vilar]] and for a number of years, it was known as the Vilar Floral Hall; however Vilar failed to make good his pledge. As a result, the name was changed in September 2005 to the Paul Hamlyn Hall, after the opera house received a donation of £10m from the estate of [[Paul Hamlyn]], towards its education and development programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6638245.stm "£10m pledged to Royal Opera House", 9 May 2007 on news.bbc.co.uk] Retrieved 24 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as acting as a main public area for performances in the main auditorium, the Paul Hamlyn Hall is also used for hosting a number of events, including private functions, dances, exhibitions, concerts, and workshops.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Royal Opera House - Linbury Studio Theatre.jpg|thumb|left|Linbury Studio Theatre – View from the stage]] --&gt;

The Linbury Studio Theatre is a flexible, secondary performance space, constructed below ground level within the Royal Opera House. It has retractable raked seating and a floor which can be raised or lowered to form a studio floor, a raised stage, or a stage with orchestra pit. The theatre can accommodate up to 400 patrons and host a variety of different events. It has been used for private functions, traditional theatre shows, and concerts, as well as community and educational events, product launches, dinners and exhibitions, etc., and is one of the most technologically advanced performance venues in London with its own public areas, including a bar and cloakroom.

The Linbury is most notable for hosting performances of experimental and independent dance and music, by independent companies and as part of the ROH2, the contemporary producing arm of the Royal Opera House.  The Linbury Studio Theatre regularly stages performances by the [[Royal Ballet School]] and also hosts the [[Young British Dancer of the Year]] competition.

The venue was constructed as part of the 90s redevelopment of the Royal Opera House.  It is named in recognition of donations made by the Linbury Trust towards the redevelopment.  The Trust is operated by [[Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover]] and his wife [[Anya Linden]], a former dancer with the Royal Ballet.  The name Linbury is derived from the names Linden and Sainsbury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linburytrust.org.uk/ The Linbury Trust on linburytrust.org.uk] Retrieved 24 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It was opened in 1999 with a collaboration from three [[Croydon]] secondary schools (including [[Coloma Convent Girls' School]] and [[Edenham High School]]) in an original performance called ''About Face''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UKTW Archive, London Royal Opera House|url=https://www.uktw.co.uk/archive/London/Royal-Opera-House/Dance/About-Face/L022557777/|website=UK Theatre Web|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Opera House, Manchester===
{{main|The Royal Ballet#Royal Opera House.2C Manchester}}

In 2008 the Royal Opera House and [[Manchester City Council]] began planning stages a new development known as '''Royal Opera House, Manchester'''. The proposal would have seen the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester|Palace Theatre]] in Manchester refurbished, to create a theatre capable of staging productions by both the [[The Royal Ballet|Royal Ballet]] and the Royal Opera. It was intended that the Royal Opera House would take residence of the theatre for an annual 18-week season, staging 16 performances by the Royal Opera, 28 performances by the Royal Ballet and other small-scale productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Higgins | first = Charlotte | title = Disharmony over Royal Opera's plan to go north | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/28/royal-opera-lowry-manchester | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 28 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Northern opera proposal evaluated | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7702690.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 31 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later [[The Lowry]] sent an open letter to the then [[Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport]], [[Ben Bradshaw]], Arts Council England, Manchester City Council and the ROH, calling for the scheme, in its current form, to be scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brown | first = Mark | title = Threat to plan for Royal Opera House in the north | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/25/lowry-manchester-royal-opera-house | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 25 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 it was announced that the project was being shelved as part of larger arts-funding cuts.&lt;ref name="Stage_031110"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = ROH shelves its plans to move north | url = https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2010/roh-shelves-its-plans-to-move-north/ | work = [[The Stage]] | publisher = The Stage Media Company Ltd | date = 3 November 2010 }} [http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/news/show/2252-roh-shelves-its-plans-to-move-north Alternative link.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sharp | first = Rob | title = Royal Opera House shelves move north | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/news/royal-opera-house-shelves-move-north-2118505.html | work = [[The Independent]] | publisher = Independent Print Ltd | date = 27 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Opera House opened a scenery-making facility for their operas and ballets at [[High House, Purfleet]], Essex on 6 December 2010. The building was designed by Nicholas Hare Architects.&lt;ref name="EEDA"&gt;[http://www.eeda.org.uk/5894.asp  "Thurrock launches new creative and cultural hub", 13 December 2010, East of England Development Agency press release on its website eeda.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718095403/http://www.eeda.org.uk/5894.asp |date=18 July 2011 }} Retrieved 9 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The East of England Development Agency, which partly funded developments on the park, notes that "the first phase includes the Royal Opera House's Bob and Tamar Manoukian Production Workshop and Community areas".&lt;ref name="EEDA"/&gt;

The Bob and Tamar Manoukian Costume Centre, also designed by Nicholas Hare Associates, opened in September 2015, and provides a costume-making facility for the Royal Opera House and a training centre for students of costume-making from [[South Essex College]]. The building also houses the Royal Opera House's collection of historically important costumes. 

Other elements at High House, Purfleet include The Backstage Centre, a new technical theatre and music training centre which is currently run by the National College for Creative Industries and was formally opened by [[Creative &amp; Cultural Skills]] in March 2013, alongside renovated farm buildings. Acme studios opened a complex of 43 artist studios in Summer 2013.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1546">The '''Sibiu Literary Circle''' ({{lang-ro|Cercul literar de la Sibiu}}) was a [[literary society|literary group]] created during [[World War II]] in [[Sibiu]] to promote the modernist liberal ideas of [[Eugen Lovinescu]].

The group was formed around [[Lucian Blaga]] and other intellectuals from [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], who had settled in Sibiu after the [[Babeş-Bolyai University|University of Cluj]] had moved there in 1940, in the wake of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] occupation of [[Northern Transylvania]]. The most active members of the group were [[Ion Negoițescu]], [[Radu Stanca]], [[Ion Desideriu Sârbu]], [[Cornel Regman]], [[Ștefan Augustin Doinaș]], [[Nicolae Balotă]], [[Eugen Todoran]], [[Eta Boeriu]], [[Radu Enescu]], and [[Ovidiu Cotruş]]. The group disbanded in 1945.

'''''Standing Horse''''' is a [[Tang dynasty tomb figures|Tang dynasty tomb figure]], created during the [[Tang dynasty]] in [[China]]. In ancient China, numerous tomb figurines and other artefacts were designed specifically to be [[Funerary art|buried with the deceased]] in large [[Tumulus|burial mounds]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michaelson|first1=Carol|title=Gilded Dragons: Buried Treasures from China's Golden Ages (exhibition catalogue)|date=1999|publisher=British Museum Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacGregory|first1=Neil|title=Chinese Tang tomb figures|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/9mtCv5mCQ-iz_PRF2p0phw|website=A History of the World in 100 Objects|publisher=BBC/British Museum|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This large figurine is glazed with the iconic tri-colour glaze, also known as [[Sancai]], which is a [[Ceramic glaze|glazing technique]] that is synonymous to the Tang dynasty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Nigel|title=Chinese glazes: their origins, chemistry, and recreation|date=1999|publisher=A.C. Black|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eckfeld|first1=Tonia|title=Imperial Tombs in Tang China, 618-907: The Politics of Paradise|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Form, material and technique ==
[[File:Gansu Museum 2007 257.jpg|thumb|[[Gansu Flying Horse]], Han dynasty, made of bronze.|left]]
The [[Shape|form]] of this [[sculpture]] appears to be harmoniously [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] at first glance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Kenneth Louis|title=Handbook of visual communication: theory, methods, and media|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on further scrutiny, it is clear that the shape of the sculpture is deeply organic, revealing a varied contour of curves and edges. When a spotlight is shone on the sculpture, deep pockets of [[shadows]] on the sculpture contrast starkly with illuminating highlights that reflect off its shiny, glazed surface.

As a historical artefact that is more than 1000-year-old, it is very well-preserved. It was created with [[earthenware]], which is a durable material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Medley|first1=Margaret|title=The Chinese Potter: A Practical History of Chinese Ceramics|date=1989|publisher=Phaidon|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vainker|first1=S.J.|title=Chinese Pottery and Porcelain|date=1991|publisher=British Museum Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze and wood were 2 other materials commonly used to create sculptures and tomb artefacts in this period and region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valenstein|first1=Suzanne|title=A handbook of Chinese ceramics|date=1998|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howard|first1=Angela Falco|title=Chinese Sculpture|date=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|location=Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, earthenware was a more practical material for tomb artefacts because it was more affordable than bronze, and more durable than wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorp|first1=Robert L.|last2=Vinograd|first2=Richard E.|title=Chinese Art and Culture|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sancai'' technique literally means ‘three colours’. However, the colours of the glazes were not limited to three in number. This technique is especially associated with the Tang Dynasty. The ''Sancai'' glaze is highly durable – most ceramics glazed with this technique has endured till today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of ''Sancai'' glazing on figures was expensive and required skilful craftsmanship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Sumptuary law]]s also restricted the usage of ''Sancai'' glaze to the [[upper class]]es, and production was controlled by the [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|imperial bureaucracy.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=藝文類聚, Yiwen Leiju - a Tang Chinese leishu encyclopedia|last=Ouyang|first=Xun|publisher=|year=624|isbn=|location=Tang China|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A Sancai piece.webm|thumb|200x200px|Short video of a ''sancai'' tomb guardian.]]

== Iconography  ==
''An iconography of a work of art is the analysis of the visual images and symbols employed.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance|last=Panofsky|first=Erwin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1939|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an [[Allegory|expressional]] subject matter, this figurine of a [[horse]] is depicted proportionally and realistically, with great attention paid to its [[Proportionality (mathematics)|anatomical accuracy]], colour treatment, [[texture (visual arts)|texture]] and [[Ornament (art)|embellishments]].

The high level of craftsmanship reflected on this sculpture demonstrate the lifelikeness and physical characteristics that this horse is supposed to embody: a handsome adult horse with an athletic body and a body of mane that is smooth, shiny and neat. Its [[Posture (psychology)|posture]] is upright, its eyes are wide-opened and its head cocked at an angle that is upright but not facing upward.

The colours applied on this horse further enhance the lifelikeness of the horse, making it look very similar to a real horse. The contrast of green against brown on this sculpture, directs the viewer's attention immediately to the elaborate [[Horse harness|harness]] on the horse, so that viewers would notice the distinctive decoration on this harness.

The intricate details rendered on the horse's harness offers viewers an insight into the type of horse this sculpture is supposed to represent: a [[Ferghana horse]] from [[Central Asia]]. Ferghana horses were very commonly depicted in [[Tang dynasty tomb figures]].&lt;ref name="Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hay|first1=Jonathan|title=Seeing through dead eyes: How early Tang tombs staged the afterlife|journal=RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics|date=2010|issue=57/58|pages=16–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconology ==
''An iconology of a work of art is the interpretation of the symbolism in the visual imagery, especially in a broader sociopolitical context, so as to determine the underlying attitudes and characteristics of a civilisation.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Caring for the afterlife ===
[[File:Hun Po soul.jpg|thumb|272x272px|In ancient China, it was believed that every person has 2 souls: the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''hun''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' soul and the '''po''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' soul.]]
The ancient Chinese believed that every person has 2 souls – 1 is called ‘''[[Hun and po|hun]]''’ and the other is called ‘''[[Hun and po|po]]''’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrell|first=Stevan|date=1979|title=The Concept of Soul in Chinese Folk Religion|url=|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=38|pages=519–528}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a person passes on, the ''hun'' soul leaves the body and ascends to [[heaven]], while the ''po'' soul remains with the [[corpse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=Shih|date=1946|title=The Concept of Immortality in Chinese Thought|url=|journal=Harvard Divinity School Bulletin|volume=|pages=26–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient China, tomb artefacts were created specifically for the ''po'' soul to use in its [[afterlife]], according to what the deceased usually needed and wanted when he or she was alive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The primary purpose of a tomb artefact was to care for its deceased master in his or her afterlife. Therefore, studying the tomb artefacts from different [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasties]] helps one to understand the changing [[social]] and [[History|historical]] circumstances of each dynasty, since the people of different dynasties had different [[need]]s and [[want]]s, depending on the sociopolitical situation of each dynasty.   
[[File:Terracotta army 5256.jpg|thumb|Part of a terracotta army from the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor]]. |left|150x150px]]
For instance, numerous tomb [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] of [[soldier]]s (also known as a "[[Terracotta Army|terracotta army]]") have been found in the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor]]. The [[Qin dynasty]] was [[Militarism|militaristic]], heavy-handed and [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] - it was a time of intense and constant [[war]]fare with its neighbours and its military was the most powerful and [[Technology|technologically]] advanced in the world.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Early Chinese Empires: Qin and Han|last=Lewis|first=Mark Edward|publisher=Belknap Press|year=2007|isbn=9780674024779|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is unsurprising to find an overwhelming quantity of tomb figurines cast in the image of soldiers in the tomb of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first emperor of China.

On the other hand, we find [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1994.285a-m/ this chessboard set] in a tomb from the [[Han dynasty]]. The Han dynasty was still a time of constant warfare.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, [[The arts|arts]] and [[culture]] were valued and widespread, and the Han Chinese had more [[Liberty|freedom]] to [[debate]] [[Philosophy|philosophical]] issues and enjoy [[intellectual]] [[game]]s, such as this game of [[chess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Old World Encounters: Cross Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times|last=Bentley|first=Jerry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chess was believed to help people understand [[Military strategy|military strategies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Chess|last=Murray|first=H. J. R.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1913|isbn=0198274033|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Tang dynasty, the [[Political sociology|socio-political]] condition of China was dramatically different from the Qin and Han dynasties, leading to the production of tomb artefacts that were dramatically different too. Tang dynasty was one that was characterized by its extravagance, prosperity, stability and competitiveness, and these attributes are understandably reflected in the characteristics of tomb figurines produced in the Tang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=T'ang China: The Rise of the East in World History|last=Adshead|first=S.

=== Assertion of Tang power ===
[[File:East-Hem 800ad.jpg|thumb|Sandwiched between East Asia and West Asia, Central Asia was characterised by conflicts and political pressure as the [[empire]]s and states of East and West Asia often vied for control over Central Asia.|150x150px]]Another theme that is critical in the interpretation of this figurine of a Central Asian horse is the tense relationship between the [[nomad]]s of Central Asia and the rest of [[Asia]]. Every dynasty in China had military [[Conflict of interest|conflicts]] with the nomads of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Inner Asia|last=Soucek|first=Svatopluk|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tang empire competed fiercely with the [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibetan]] empire and the [[Islamic empires]] for control of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=East Asia: A Cultural, Social and Political History|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia Buckley|last2=Walthall|first2=Anne|last3=Palais|first3=James B.|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2006|isbn=0618133844|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia|last=Beckwith|first=Christopher I.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1987|isbn=0691024693|location=Princeton|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nomads of Central Asia were fierce [[warrior]]s with powerful [[Horses in warfare|warhorses]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient China and Its Enemies: the Rise of Nomadic Power in East Asian History|last=Di Cosmo|first=Nicola|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521770645|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to a combination of [[Geography|geographical]] and [[Politics|political]] reasons. Geographically, Central Asia is difficult for [[agriculture]] and it is also far from the [[sea]], thereby cutting it off from [[Trade|trading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gernet|first=Jacques|date=1996|title=A History of Chinese Civilization|url=|journal=9780521497817|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, nomadic horse people dominated Central Asia for 2000 years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Their nomadic lifestyle naturally trained them to be highly suitable for warfare. Their [[Equestrianism|horse-riding]] skills and [[archery]] techniques made them the most militarily powerful people in the world. Their military power is further sharpened by the fact that [[East Asia]] and [[Western Asia|West Asia]] were often competing to gain control of Central Asia.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
[[File:2015-09-23-090637 - Historisches Museum, Dreifarbiges Kamel (Tang Dynastie 618-907).jpg|thumb|A ''sancai'' tomb figurine depicting a Central Asian camel.]]
It is in light of this socio-historical context that one realises why it was a source of pride for a Tang dynasty tomb to be filled with horses, camels, female attendants, robust [[Domestic worker|manservants]] and exotic dancers from Central Asia. During the Tang period, the ability to [[Horses in East Asian warfare|own powerful horses]] and servants from Central Asia would have been a testimony of a person's wealth, power and [[Social stratification|social standing]]. This is especially since Central Asia was renowned for its military power, strong warriors and formidable horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warfare in Chinese History|last=van de Ven|first=Hans|last2=Twitchett|first2=Denis|publisher=Koninklijke Brill|year=2000|isbn=9004117741|location=Leiden|pages=|chapter=Tibet in Tang's Grand Strategy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would also have been reflective of a person's [[Fashion|stylish]], [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] taste, as it shows that this person is globalised and familiar with [[culture]]s outside of China.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=China's Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty|last=Lewis|first=Mark Edward|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780674033061|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Tang dynasty's tomb artefacts, such as ''Standing Horse'', were meant to assert Tang China's power over Central Asia.

=== Opulence of Tang society ===

[[File:Joueuse de polo Tang Guimet 29101.jpg|thumb|150x150px|A Tang dynasty tomb figurine of a woman playing polo.]]
Tang dynasty is generally regarded as a high point in Chinese [[Civilization|civilisation]], and a [[Golden Age|golden age]] of cosmopolitan culture.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Many neighbouring countries maintained strong [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] ties with it, traded extensively with it and sought its [[Economy|economic]] assistance and military protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sui-Tang China and Its Turko-Mongol Neighbors: Culture, Power and Connections, 580-800|last=Skaff|first=Jonathan Karam|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=978019-9996278|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[superpower]], akin to the [[United States]] of today.

The [[Capital city|capital]] of the Tang dynasty was the most populous city in the world.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; With this large [[population]], the dynasty was able to have a professional and powerful [[army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Draft Discussion of Early Tang Dynasty's Military Affairs History|last=Wang|first=Yongxing|publisher=Kunlun Press|year=2003|isbn=7800406695|location=Beijing|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The army not only defended the [[empire]], but was also used to dominate the lucrative [[trade route]]s along the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silk Road: Monks, Warriors &amp; Merchants|last=Boulnois|first=Luce|publisher=Odyssey Books|year=2005|isbn=9622177212|location=Hong Kong|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A huge population also meant that there were more professional craftsmen in the empire, to create large quantities and higher quality works of art.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang dynasty|last=Benn|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0195176650|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a period of progress, prosperity and stability, making it a highly conducive environment to pursue the arts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Tomb figurines in the Tang dynasty often featured servants, attendants, dancers, musicians, [[camel]]s and horses from Central Asia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the tomb of a high-ranking male, there may also be figurines of soldiers, [[official]]s and [[courtesan]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Performativity of Tang tomb figurines ===
[[File:Tomb figurine of a horse, China, Tang dynasty, early 600s AD, glazed earthenware - Östasiatiska museet, Stockholm - DSC09590.JPG|thumb|Earthenware figurine of a horse not glazed with ''Sancai'' - typically for someone wealthy but not an aristocrat or high-ranking official.]]
[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - tri-coloured figure of a civil official.jpg|left|thumb|''Sancai''-glazed figurine of a civil official from the Tang dynasty.]]
Tomb figurines in the Tang dynasty were made to be [[Attractiveness|visually compelling]] and it is especially obvious when they are seen in an entire set, or when compared with figurines of other dynasties.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/calendar/tang-cosmopolitanism/|title=Performing in the afterlife: performance and performativity of Tang tomb art|last=Lin|first=Wei-Cheng|date=|website="Tang Cosmopolitanism: An Interdisciplinary Symposium" by Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intricate details of each figurine's craftsmanship imbue them with a great sense of physical [[Metaphysics of presence|presence]] and [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]].&lt;ref name="Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard" /&gt; Their personalised [[facial expression]]s and postures distinguish each figurine in an imaginable [[time]] and [[space]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

This great emphasis on the [[performativity]] of tomb figurines could be related to the [[Competitiveness|competitive]] Tang culture of [[Exhibition|publicly displaying]] one's wealth and power.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The [[social class]]es of Tang society were mobile. This means that people in the different social classes could improve its status through [[Diligence|hard work]] and move to an upper class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Timothy C.|date=1979|title=Self and Society in Tang Dynasty Love Tales|url=|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=99|pages=95–100|jstor=598956}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created a competitive society, where people often showed off their wealth and power. Members of prominent families or high-ranking officials often paraded through streets in the public, with troops of servants mounted on beautiful horses.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This culture of public display takes place even during [[funeral]]s. After the funerary ceremonies at home are complete, there would be a [[funeral procession]] to transport the deceased from home to [[grave]]site.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=通典 - Tongdian, a Tang Chinese institutional history and encyclopedia text|last=Du|first=You|publisher=|year=801|isbn=|location=Tang China|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Plat à offrandes Chine Musée Guimet 2418 3.jpg|thumb|150x150px|A Tang dynasty plate glazed in ''Sancai''.]]
The funeral procession is a highly elaborate, visible and competitive public [[spectacle]], designed to impress the public with [[altar]]s, canopies, flowers, paper figurines, burnt offerings and most importantly, with the display of impressive tomb figurines.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The competitive nature of funeral processions got so out of hand, that the emperor had to issue imperial edicts to regulate the quantity and size of tomb figurines, according to the deceased's social status.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Tomb artefacts were meant to glorify its deceased master and the master's living family.

Tomb figurines of the Tang dynasty were characterized by its wide variety, high quality, energy, performance and lifelikeness.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The tomb figurines of Tang China were unprecedented – never before in Chinese history were the figurines endowed with such qualities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The pursuit of more and more vibrant colours led to the invention of the tri-colour glazing technique, or ''Sancai'' glaze, to further enhance the visual appearance of the figurines.&lt;ref name="Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard" /&gt; This great emphasis on performance burial and extravagant tomb figurines in Tang China, is consistent with Tang China's opulent culture, media and arts. This tomb figurine of a horse, was expected to represent not only itself, but also expected to serve and perform a social and cultural role for the Tang dynasty.

The '''Teatro Capranica''' is a theatre situated at 101 Piazza Capranica in the [[Colonna, City of Rome|Colonna district]] of Rome. Originally constructed in 1679 by the Capranica family and housed in the early [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] Palazzo Capranica, it was the second public theatre to open in Rome. It was the site of many premieres of [[Baroque opera]]s including Caldara's ''[[Tito e Berenice]]'', Scarlatti's ''[[Griselda (A. Scarlatti)|Griselda]]'', and Vivaldi's ''[[Ercole su'l Termodonte]]''. The Capranica ceased operating as a full-scale theatre and opera house in 1881 and in 1922 was converted into a cinema. Following the closure of the cinema in 2000, it has functioned on a hire basis as a conference and performance venue.

==History==
The palazzo in which the theatre was situated had been originally constructed in 1451 by Cardinal [[Domenico Capranica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roma e Città del Vaticano: le chiese, i palazzi, i musei, le piazze, l'archeologia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSEAD60_F4gC&amp;pg=PA122|year=2002|publisher=Touring Editore|isbn=978-88-365-2623-9|pages=122|quote="... palazzo Capranica, eretto nel 1451 inglobando case preesistenti e la cappella di S. Agnese..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to serve as both his own residence and the future  home of the [[Almo Collegio Capranica]], a college for young clerics which he founded in 1457. One of the few remaining examples of Roman residential architecture of the early renaissance, it has a large side tower and a ''[[piano nobile]]'' lit by three cross [[mullion]] windows as well as three windows in the late [[Italian Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] which suggest that the palace may have incorporated an earlier building on the site.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari-Bravo p. 353; Richardson p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1670s, another member of the family, Pompeo Capranica, had a private theatre carved out from existing family apartments without changing the exterior of the building. The theatre was inaugurated on 6 January 1679 with [[Arcangelo Corelli]] leading the orchestra for the premiere of [[Bernardo Pasquini]]'s opera ''Dov'è amore è pietà''.&lt;ref&gt;Casaglia; Harper and Lindgren&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Il nemico di se stesso by Scarlatti - libretto title page.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Libretto for [[Alessandro Scarlatti|Scarlatti]]'s ''Il nemico di se stesso'', one of his many works to premiere at the Teatro Capranica]]   
With the accession of [[Pope Alexander VIII]], Pompeo Capranica and his brother Federico received permission to enlarge the theatre and open it to the public. They entrusted the task to [[Carlo Buratti]] (a student of [[Carlo Fontana]]) who completely rebuilt the theatre in 1694 transforming it into the standard U-shape with rich ornamentation and 6 tiers of 26 boxes each. It re-opened as a public theatre (Rome's second) on 18 January 1695 with a performance of ''Clearco in Negroponte'' a three-act opera jointly composed by [[Giovanni Lorenzo Lulier]],  [[Tommaso Gaffi]] and [[Carlo Francesco Cesarini]].&lt;ref&gt;Natuzzi p. 43; Casaglia. Rome's first public theatre was the [[Teatro Tor di Nona]] which opened in 1671.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new theatre still lacked a public entrance opening onto the street. Audiences could only enter through the workshop of a carpenter on the ground floor of the palazzo. His lease required him to close his workshop during the opera season and to provide at his own expense a wooden staircase to enable the spectators to climb into the theatre. It was a situation that was not be rectified until the 19th century.&lt;ref name = "Pezone78"&gt;Pezone p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Filippo Juvarra, Courtyard of a Palace, Project for a Stage.jpg|thumb|upright=1|One of [[Filippo Juvarra]]'s preliminary set designs for ''[[Tito e Berenice]]'' which premiered at the Capranica in 1714]]
Under [[Pope Innocent XII]], public theatrical performances were once again forbidden and the theatre remained closed from 1699 to 1711. When the prohibition on public performances was lifted, the Capranica brothers re-opened the theatre and soon attracted the patronage of [[Pietro Ottoboni (cardinal)|Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni]] who contributed to the cost the renovation after its long closure and hired his architect, [[Filippo Juvarra]], to renovate the stage.&lt;ref name = "Pezone78" /&gt; The two decades after the re-opening marked the heyday of the theatre which would become Rome's primary public opera house and see the premieres of many new operas and innovative sets designed by Filippo Juvarra and [[Francesco Galli Bibiena]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari-Bravo p. 353 &lt;/ref&gt; The composer [[Alessandro Scarlatti]] was closely associated with the Capranica which premiered several of his early operas beginning in 1679. When he returned to Rome in 1718 after his years in Naples, he produced his three finest operas for the theatre, ''[[Telemaco (Scarlatti)|Telemaco]]'', ''Marco Attilio Regolo'' and ''[[Griselda (A. Scarlatti)|Griselda]]''. Between 1718 and 1721, the Capranica also saw the premieres of Scarlatti's [[oratorio]], ''La gloriosa gara tra la Santità e la Sapienza'', and several of his [[cantata]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Della Corte; Casaglia&lt;/ref&gt;

With the construction of new public theatres in Rome such as the [[Teatro Alibert]] (1718), [[Teatro Valle]] (1727) and [[Teatro Argentina]] (1732), the Capranica gradually declined in importance, although in the 1750s it was much favoured by [[Goldoni]] for their stagings of his plays. In 1760, he wrote his comedy ''Pamela maritata'' expressly for the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Goldoni (1828) pp. 70–71; Goldoni (1829) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre went through several more renovations, closures, and proprietors starting in the second half of the 18th century. By the 19th century, it had ceased being a leading opera house in the city and tended to concentrate on comic operas and plays (often in [[Roman dialect]]), acrobatic displays, and puppet shows. The theatre returned to the Capranica family in 1853 when Marchese Bartolomeo Capranica bought it back from [[House of Torlonia|Prince Alessandro Torlonia]] and spent a great deal of money renovating it. However, it never regained its former prestige. The American writer Henry P. Leland described it in 1863 as:

&lt;blockquote&gt; the resort for the Roman ''minenti'' decked in all their bravery.&lt;ref&gt;''Minenti'' is a [[Roman dialect]] word used particularly in the early 19th century to denote a class of newly well-off artisans and workers in the city (both men and women) who displayed their status by wearing ostentatious clothes and jewelery. It is thought to derive from ''eminente'' ("eminent"). See Nicassio p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Here came the shoemaker, the tailor, and the small artisan, all with their wives or women, and with them the wealthy peasant who had ten cents to pay for entrance. Here the audience wept and laughed, applauded the actors, and talked to each other from one side of the house to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Leland pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eventually, the costs of upkeep and dwindling audiences led to the Capranica's  demise. It closed permanently following a performance of Verdi's opera ''[[Ernani]]'' on 1 March 1881. At first it was rented out as a furniture warehouse, but then stood completely empty from 1895 until 1922 when it was converted into a cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Franchi and Sartori pp. xlv–xlvi; Groppi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today's theatre==
After the closure of the Cinema Capranica in 2000, the 800 seat theatre with its now minimal stage was re-opened as a conference and performance venue available on a hire basis. Under the propietorship of the Hotel Nazionale and managed by Montecitorio Eventi S.r.l., it has hosted four small-scale opera productions by the association "Aulico – Opera &amp; Musica" and over the years has been the setting for numerous meetings of Italian political parties.&lt;ref&gt;Ketkoff; Groppi&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, [[Silvio Berlusconi]] gave a two-hour speech there in which he introduced the [[Popolo della Libertà]] candidates for the [[Italian general election, 2013|2013 Italian general election]].&lt;ref&gt;Adnkronos&lt;/ref&gt; During a meeting of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Partito Democratico]] at the Capranica that lasted late into the night of 19 April 2013, [[Pier Luigi Bersani]] resigned as party leader following his failure to form a coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;Pace&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera premieres==
{{main|List of works premiered at the Teatro Capranica}}
More than 50 works (including operas, oratorios, cantatas, and plays) have premiered at the Teatro Capranica. The first opera to be premiered there was [[Bernardo Pasquini|Pasquini]]'s ''Dov'è amore è pietà'' which inaugurated the theatre in 1679.&lt;ref&gt;The complete score is lost. However, one of its arias is preserved in the Biblioteca Estense in [[Modena]]. See  Harper and Lindgren.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1728 premiere of [[Riccardo Broschi]]'s ''L'isola di Alcina'' was marked by the presence of his brother, the celebrated [[castrato]] singer [[Farinelli]], in the role of [[Ruggiero (character)|Ruggiero]].&lt;ref&gt;Strohm p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of the operas premiered at the Capranica prior to 1750, it was an ''[[opera seria]]''. The premieres at the theatre after 1750 were almost exclusively of the ''[[opera buffa]]'' genre, such as [[Baldassarre Galuppi|Galuppi]]'s ''[[La cantarina]]'' (1756) or [[Niccolò Piccinni|Piccinni]]'s  ''La donna di spirito'' (1770). Many of the shorter ones, such as [[Antonio Sacchini]]'s ''La vendemmia'' (1760), were specifically written to be performed as comic [[Intermezzo#Opera intermezzo|intermezzo]]s for prose plays.&lt;ref name = "AA"/&gt; Other operas premiered at the Capranica include:
*[[Antonio Caldara|Caldara]]'s ''[[Tito e Berenice]]'' (1714)&lt;ref name = "AA"&gt;Casaglia&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alessandro Scarlatti|Scarlatti]]'s ''[[Griselda (A. Scarlatti)|Griselda]]'' (1721)&lt;ref name = "Della Corte"&gt;Della Corte&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Vivaldi]]'s ''[[Ercole su'l Termodonte]]'' (1723) and ''[[Giustino (Vivaldi)|Giustino]]'' (1724)&lt;ref&gt;Natuzzi pp. 7, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
&lt;!-- Discuss before changing this to an infobox. TDA is a painting with a lot of intricate detail and looks like an incomprehensible smear at infobox default size --&gt;[[File:The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, William Etty, 1832.jpg|right|upright=1.8|thumb|''The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate''|alt=Painting of an angel hovering over a crowd of angels and humans]]
'''''The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate'''''&lt;!--

 The painting has three titles, of which the first two are both in common use:
 * "...Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate" is the title it is labelled with in the Manchester Art Gallery and also the name it's catalogued under at BBC Your Paintings, so is the name readers are most likely to know it by.

--&gt;, also known as '''''The Destroying Angel and Daemons Inflicting Divine Vengeance on the Wicked and Intemperate'''''{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=24}} and as '''''The Destruction of the Temple of Vice''''',{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=185}} is an [[oil painting]] on canvas by English artist [[William Etty]], first exhibited in 1832. Etty had become famous for [[Nude (art)|nude paintings]], and acquired a reputation for tastelessness, indecency and a lack of creativity. With ''The Destroying Angel'' he hoped to disprove his critics with an openly moral piece. The painting is 127.8&amp;nbsp;cm by 101.9&amp;nbsp;cm (50&amp;nbsp;in by 40&amp;nbsp;in) and depicts a classical temple under attack from a [[destroying angel (Bible)|destroying angel]] and a group of [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemons]]. Some of the humans appear dead or unconscious, others flee or struggle against the daemons.

When first exhibited in 1832, ''The Destroying Angel'' was widely praised for its technical brilliance, but critics were divided on the subject matter. Some praised its vivid blend of fear and beauty; others criticised its theme as inappropriate, and chastised Etty for wasting his talent. As Etty had hoped, the painting changed critics' perception of him; some saw it as indicating previously unseen depths, others considered it a renunciation of his previous work. Henry Payne, who had commissioned the painting, sold it in 1854 to [[Joseph Whitworth|Sir Joseph Whitworth]]. Whitworth donated it in 1882 to the [[Manchester Art Gallery]], where it remains.

==Background==
[[File:Etty Youth 1832.jpg|right|upright=.9|thumb|''Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm'' was described by ''The Morning Chronicle'' as "an indulgence of what we once hoped a classical, but which are now convinced, is a lascivious mind".{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=33}}|alt=Painting of naked people on a boat]]
[[William Etty]] (1787–1849), the seventh son of a [[York]] baker and miller,&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=8925|title=William Etty}}&lt;/ref&gt; had originally been an apprentice printer in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]],{{sfn|Gilchrist|1855|p=23}} but on completing his seven-year apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to [[London]] to become an artist.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Strongly influenced by the works of [[Titian]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], he became famous for painting [[Nude (art)|&lt;!-- Normally this would be overlinking, but in this context readers are likely to want to learn more about the tradition of nude art --&gt;nude figures]] in biblical, literary and mythological settings.&lt;ref name="MAG Etty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html |title=About the artist |publisher=Manchester Art Gallery |accessdate=10 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211024806/http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html |archivedate=11 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his peers greatly admired him, and he was elected a full [[Royal Academy of Arts#Membership|Royal Academician]] in 1828, ahead of [[John Constable]].{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=118}}

Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nudes.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}} While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 [[Society for the Suppression of Vice|Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=53}} Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=55}} Although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received,{{efn-ua|Etty's male nude portraits were primarily of mythological heroes and classical combat, genres in which the depiction of male nudity was considered acceptable in England.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|pp=32–33}}}} many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent.&lt;ref name="MAG Etty" /&gt;{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}} Etty's ''[[Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm]]'', completed in 1830 and exhibited in 1832, attracted scathing criticism for its supposed seductive and sensual nature, leading ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'' to comment that "[Etty] should not persist, with an unhallowed fancy, to pursue Nature to her holy recesses. He is a laborious draughtsman, and a beautiful colourist; but he has not taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on the naked truth."{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=33}}

Needled by repeated attacks from ''The Morning Chronicle'' on his supposed indecency, poor taste and lack of creativity, Etty determined to produce a work that would prove his detractors wrong.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=36}} The result was ''The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate''.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=37}}

''The Destroying Angel'' was commissioned by Henry Payne&lt;!-- Don't wikilink this unless and until we have an article on him, it goes to a disambiguation page on which the Payne in question doesn't appear --&gt; of Leicester in 1822, on a promise of 60&amp;nbsp;[[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|63|1822|r=-2}}|0}} in today's terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) when complete.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=185}} Payne had granted Etty complete freedom in the creation of the piece,{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=37}} but Etty had done little with the notion until, stung by ''The Morning Chronicle'''s criticism, he decided to return to the theme, completing it in 1832.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=37}} As Etty had become a more prominent painter in the meantime, Payne paid him £130 (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|130|1832|r=-3}}|0}} in today's terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) for the piece.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=185}}{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=23}} The work is thought to have been inspired by the works of [[John Milton]] and [[Alexander Pope]], by [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' and possibly by the [[July Revolution|French Revolution of 1830]],{{sfn|Burnage|2011a|p=167}}{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=39}} in which Etty had been caught up during a visit to Paris to study in the [[Louvre]].{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=24}} The topic was one to which Etty felt particularly close, saying that he had put his "whole soul" into the piece.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=40}}

==Composition==
[[File:The Destroying Angel... (Angel).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The angel is wreathed in smoke, and is poised to throw a thunderbolt.|alt=Angel holding a spear and surrounded by smoke]]
''The Destroying Angel'' is a [[visionary art|visionary work]], depicting a wholly imaginary scene rather than a scene from history, literature or mythology.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=186}}{{efn-ua|name=vision|The catalogue for the 1832 Summer Exhibition described ''The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate'' as "a finished sketch of that class of compositions called by the Romans ''Visions'', not having their origin in history or poetry."&lt;ref name="Times1832"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Royal Academy |day_of_week=Thursday |date=24 May 1832 |page_number=3 |issue=14860 |column=F }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It measures 127.8&amp;nbsp;cm by 101.9&amp;nbsp;cm (50&amp;nbsp;in by 40&amp;nbsp;in), and depicts an ornate imaginary [[Classical architecture|classical temple]].{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=37}}  The temple and its occupants are under attack from a [[destroying angel (Bible)|destroying angel]] and a group of [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemons]], who are in the process of abducting its human occupants.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=131}} The angel itself is wreathed in smoke in the centre of the image. Having destroyed one side of the temple, it is poised to hurl a [[thunderbolt]].{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}} Below the angel, daemons attack a group of around 25 semi-naked human figures. Each human is shown in a different position and expresses terror differently,{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=37}} and each is deliberately painted in paler tones than those Etty typically used to suggest death and pallor.{{sfn|Burnage|2011c|p=220}} As with most of Etty's works, the figures are a collection of depictions of models in studio poses, later arranged for dramatic effect, rather than painted as a group.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=186}}

To the right of the painting, daemons drag terrified women away. The woman in the lower right-hand corner turns to see flames reflected in the eyes of the daemon who holds her from behind, with a look of horrified guilt on her face.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}} Behind her, other women struggle helplessly with the daemons or are carried away unconscious, having fainted.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}}

In the centre of the foreground is a figure modelled on [[Caius Gabriel Cibber]]'s ''Raving Madness'', which at the time was one of two [[monumental sculpture]]s above the entrance to [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bethlem Hospital]] ("Bedlam"), and a well-known London landmark and symbol of insanity.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=131}}{{efn-ua|''Raving Madness'' and its companion ''Melancholy Madness'' remain in the care of Bethlem Hospital, and currently, flank the grand staircase of the Bethlem Museum of the Mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumofthemind.org.uk/about|title=About Us|year=2015|publisher=Bethlem Museum of the Mind|accessdate=6 April 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a daemon pulls on one end of the chain.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}} Beside this lunatic is an unconscious or dead gambler, his winnings spread on the floor beside him.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}}

}}
Behind the central images of the lunatic, daemon and gambler are a group of people who have only just realised what is happening. A male figure in a red [[Phrygian cap]] (a symbol of the French and American Revolutions) reclines with his arm around the waist of a female figure (identified as a [[maenad|bacchante]] by Sarah Burnage of the University of York).{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}} The female figure shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or to block out the horror taking place in front of her.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}}

On the left-hand side of the painting, in the background, the structure of the temple crumbles and burns in the wake of the angel's path, while figures in varying stages of undress flee the approaching daemons. In the foreground a drunken man mimics the pose of the [[Barberini Faun]] as he clutches his head,{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=131}} alert enough to realise his fate if he does not escape but too intoxicated to flee.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=38}}

Around the painting lie corpses in various states of undress. ''The Destroying Angel'' was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the [[July Revolution]] at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in ''The Destroying Angel'' were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France,{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=39}} and perhaps also by the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829–51)|cholera epidemic]] which killed thousands in London in 1832.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=39}}

==Reception==
''The Destroying Angel'' was first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1832.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=37}} It immediately generated much critical and public interest, and was compared favourably with ''[[The Fall of the Damned]]'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]''&lt;!-- I know this is wikilinked twice, but I think it makes sense to link it here as readers are likely to want to see what it was being compared to --&gt; and "Breughell's frightful fancies".{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=39}}{{Ref supports2|&lt;ref name="Examiner"&gt;{{cite journal|date=10 June 1832|title=Fine Arts|journal=The Examiner|publisher=John Hunt|location=London|issue=1271|page=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;|"Breughell's frightful fancies"}}

{{Quote box|width=27em|align=right|salign=right|quote=We wish especially, that one of Mr. Etty's high and deserved estimation would give the world only what shall tend to improve the public taste in morals as well as in art&amp;nbsp;... and when we remember his 'Guardian Angels' and other works of that class, we are at no loss to quote an authority, when we have his own against himself; and turn with a feeling of regret from such works as some he has exhibited this and the last year of a different character. Even the 'Demons and Destroying Angels', though it seems to point to a moral, is somewhat of too pantomimic an effect, and is calculated to excite any but such ideas as we should wish to see produced by Art.|source=''The Library of the Fine Arts'' review of the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, 1832&lt;ref name="Library1832"&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 1832|title=Exhibition of the Royal Academy|journal=Library of the Fine Arts|volume=4|issue=18|publisher=M. Arnold|location=London|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Although the painting was celebrated as a technical accomplishment, some critics were uncertain if it had the correct moral effect. ''The Library of the Fine Arts'' was critical of its "pantomimic" quality, which it considered "calculated to excite any but such ideas as we should wish to see produced by Art",&lt;ref name="Library1832" /&gt; while ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]'' complained about the depiction of women being attacked, arguing: "Mr Etty should not treat the fair sex in this harsh and wanton manner. We doubt his right to put a single one of them into the hands of a Demon, much less to deliver them over by the dozen to the grasp of the destroyers."&lt;ref name="Examiner" /&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' said, &lt;blockquote&gt;We do not profess to understand what class of compositions that is which originates neither in history nor poetry{{efn-ua|name=vision}}—no doubt Mr. Etty does; but as far as we can comprehend his picture, which is much more intelligible than his language, it represents a quantity of able-bodied demons, who appear angry at the ladies for having stayed out so long, and who are come to fetch them home accordingly&lt;/blockquote&gt; and criticised Etty for a "slovenly manner" and for "abusing his rich gifts, and [wasting] upon the wild and unmeaning what might be made subservient to much more worthy purposes".&lt;ref name="Times1832" /&gt; Despite this, the same critic conceded that "The work is one of extraordinary power" and that "The figures are drawn with exquisite skill, the grouping admirably varied, and yet so combined as to present a complete picture, and the colouring vigorous and harmonious in an eminent degree."&lt;ref name="Times1832" /&gt;

Other critics admired Etty's unusual interpretation of apocalyptic religious imagery, his ability to give distinct characters and shapes to the individual demons and their victims, and the vividness of his imagination.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|pp=39–40}} ''[[The Morning Post]]'' particularly praised Etty's ability to convey "creation conceived and thrown upon the canvas with all the fury of poetical inspiration" by combining the "dauntless spirit of a sketch" with the "powerful impression of a finished picture".{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=40}} The prominent art critic [[William Paulet Carey]] (writing under the name of 'Ridolfi') championed ''The Destroying Angel'', and in particular Etty's ability to balance beauty, horror and fear without descending into tastelessness.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|pp=40–41}} Carey saw Etty as proof that British artistic traditions were equal to any others in the world, and ''The Destroying Angel'' as evidence of Etty's "redeeming grace and spirit".{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=41}} Etty's long-standing adversaries at ''The Morning Chronicle'' found little to attack in the painting, their review stating that "The upper part of the picture is masterly, grand and beautiful. The lower part not so well, but some of the figures are in admirable action and fine drawing."{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|pp=41–42}} The reticence of ''The Morning Chronicle'' prompted Carey to comment that they were in "envious silence".{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=42}}

Despite some criticism, ''The Destroying Angel'' changed the way Etty was perceived by critics. They commonly had viewed Etty's works as insights into his mind, generally with the aim of discrediting him for supposed sexual deviancies.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=40}} Confronted with a piece so obviously intended to convey a moral lesson, many of those same critics felt that Etty had revealed a more moral nature than they had previously believed.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=40}} Many explicitly saw ''The Destroying Angel'' as a counterweight to the nude paintings for which Etty was famous, or even a representation of Etty's own repentance for or renunciation of his previous works.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=41}} ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' described the painting as "a sermon to [Etty's] admirers&amp;nbsp;... where he inflicts poetical justice upon his own gay dames and their gallants, their revels being broken in upon, and they themselves being carried off most unceremoniously, like that ''little'' gentleman Don Juan, by sundry grim-looking brawny devils".&lt;ref name="Fraser's1832"&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 1832|title=Our Royal-Academical Lounge|journal=Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country|publisher=James Fraser|location=London|volume=5|issue=30|page=719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After 1832, Etty exhibited over 80 more paintings at the Summer Exhibition. He remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=42}} Yet he remained, in the majority view, a pornographer. [[Charles Robert Leslie]] observed shortly after Etty's death that {{nowrap|"[Etty]}} himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leslie|first=Charles Robert|date=30 March 1850|title=Lecture on the Works of the late W. Etty, Esq, R.A., by Professor Leslie|journal=The Athenæum|location=London|issue=1170|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etty remained commercially successful in his lifetime, amassing £17,000 (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|17000|1849|r=-5}}|0}} in today's terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) by his death.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

Etty died in 1849, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}} Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}} Henry Payne sold ''The Destroying Angel'' in 1854 for 770 guineas (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|808.5|1854|r=-3}}|0}} in today's terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) to [[Joseph Whitworth|Sir Joseph Whitworth]],{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=283}} who donated it in 1882 to the [[Manchester Art Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/the-destroying-angel-and-daemons-of-evil-interrupting-the204938|title=The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate|work=BBC Your Paintings|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it remains.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=130}} The painting was exhibited as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the [[York Art Gallery]] in 2011–12.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=131}}

[[File:John Everett Millais Cymon and Iphigenia.jpg|right|thumb|Millais's ''Cymon and Iphigenia'' is one of the few later works influenced by ''The Destroying Angel.''|alt=Savege in a leopardskin and a woman in a wedding dress, surrounded by young women in various stages of undress]]
As Etty had rapidly fallen from fashion, his works had little influence on most subsequent painters. [[William Edward Frost]] was a great admirer of Etty, and Frost's ''Una Alarmed by Fauns'' (1843) and ''Una and the Wood Nymphs'' (1847) owe a conscious debt to ''The Destroying Angel'' in their depiction of a group of semi-clad daemonic and human figures,{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=433}} as does [[John Everett Millais]]'s early work ''Cymon and Iphigenia'' (1848).{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=437}} As Etty's style became increasingly unpopular, those artists who had imitated him, other than Frost, soon abandoned the style. Etty's biographer Leonard Robinson contends that the later [[fairy painting]]s of [[Richard Dadd]], which often show large crowds of mythical creatures mingling with humans, were influenced by Etty but concedes that Dadd was likely unconscious of Etty's influence on his style.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=438}}

'''''The Mocking of Christ''''' (German: '''''Die Verspottung Christi''''') is an early oil on wood painting (1503–1505) by [[Matthias Grünewald]]. It is located today in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]].

== Description ==
Christ sits blindfolded on a low stone wall. His hands and arms are bound with a rope. A torturer who pulls on the rope stands before him, with his back turned to the viewer. Another stands behind Christ and tugs on his hair and has raised his fist to strike him. On the right a man with a staff in his left hand and with his other holds back the second torturer, who appears not to notice him.

An older man faces the man with the staff, and lays his hands upon the latter's shoulders, and appears to be conversing with him. In the background are three further men: on the left a musician who plays a flute with one hand while beating a small drum with the other, a youth near the center of the image, and an older man on the right.

''The Oasis'' is a short [[Satire|satirical]] novel by American writer [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy.]] Published by [[Random House]] in 1949, it is McCarthy's second novel. Described by McCarthy as a [[Philosophical fiction|“conte philosophique,”]]&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Nicholas. "Social Utopia: Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy’s The Oasis." Pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt; it tells the story of a group of embattled intellectuals, their quest to establish a Utopian community in the mountains of New England, and their failure to surmount ideological and personal differences for the greater good of the commune. Doubling as a [[roman à clef]], ''The Oasis'' borrows heavily from McCarthy's experiences and frustrations with the short lived [[European-American Group,]] and serves more broadly as a critique of the “abstract idealism of intellectuals”&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs-Abrams, Sabrina. "The Liberal Cauldron: Satire of the Postwar Intellectual." Mary McCarthy: Gender, Politics, and the Postwar Intellectual. Pg. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; and their inability to enact actual change.

== Plot ==
Set in the near future following 1949, ''The Oasis'' depicts a group of fifty radical and liberal [[Intellectual|intellectuals]] who venture into the mountains of New England to create a shared living commune (aptly named, “[[Utopia]]”). Already present in Utopia's formation, however, is a deep ideological schism between two rivaling factions: the cynical Realists and self-righteous Purists. The Realists, led by the embittered former [[Marxism|Marxist]] William Taub, anticipate the experiment to end in little more than a summer vacation, awaiting Utopia's eventual demise, while the Purists, led by the magazine editor Macdougal Macdermott, are hesitant to perform any action that could contradict their radical, [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] beliefs.

The first challenge presented to both factions is whether or not they will admit the Lockman family, led by the exuberant, blue-blooded Joe Lockman, into Utopia. Macdermott, who regards Lockman as a “philistine,”&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Mary. The Oasis. Pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; eventually grants the Lockmans his approval for fear that he might otherwise appear elitist. The acceptance of the Lockmans, however, calls forth the larger question, “Was it to follow that anyone could be admitted to Utopia?”&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy. Pg. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the first night in Utopia, it is the Realist leader Taub, not Macdermott, that finds Lockman to be a nuisance, put on edge by Lockman's bombastic spirit and hunting rifle. The next morning, Katy Norell, one of Utopia's more vocal Purists, burns herself and ruins the commune's breakfast while cooking. Most likely an honest mishap, the incident is quickly politicized and blamed on Lockman by the Realists. Following the mishap, Katy's husband, Preston, publicly scolds Katy for ruining breakfast, demonstrating the immense strain that communal living has taken on the residents of Utopia.

That night, the Realists convene a communal meeting, conspiring to exile Joe and assert their dominance over the Purists. When they are given the floor, however, both Taub and his followers are unable to articulate what it is they want or on what grounds they wish to expel Joe. The meeting ends with the Purists laughing at Taub. Macdermott dismisses the Realists as “revolutionary nihilists,” explaining, “They don’t know what they want… They’re so conservative they’re afraid of their own thoughts.”&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy. Pg. 105-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short “lyrical period” of peace, prosperity, and basking in the [[pastoral]] quaintness of the commune, the Utopians begin to question the purpose of their project, and whether or not their mission serves a greater good. Katy Norell laments not living up to the expectations of Monteverdi, the ideological “Founder” of the commune and champion of the Purists’ beliefs. They consider creating a “United States of Europe in Exile,” a mission to bring [[Refugee|refugees]] displaced by [[World War II]] to America in order to create more small-scale communities like their own. However, the plan falls apart almost as quickly as it is proposed. Grand ambitions to contact congressmen, trade unionists, and newspapers dissolve into an effort to make a simple pamphlet, but this idea is also abandoned.

One day, the Taubs, Katy, and other members of the commune go strawberry picking on the outskirts of Utopia, only to find that a group of locals have beaten them to the site. When the Utopians ask the locals to leave some berries for them, the Utopians are rudely dismissed. Seeing their dismay, Joe Lockman fires blanks from his gun in order to ward the intruding locals away from Utopia. Lockman then insists everyone in Utopia padlock their front doors, prompting a commune-wide philosophical debate on the implications of privatizing property in Utopia. The discussion prompted by the intruders’ arrival grows broader and broader, with Katy and Taub disagreeing on whether Utopia can survive such a shake up. Katy, drunk, ends up lying in the grass in order to take in the pastoral setting, while Jim Haines, a “[[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]-esque” magazine editor who is revered by all Utopians, begins to pack up his car to leave the commune, confirming Katy's worst suspicions that, “Ultimately, Utopia would fail.”&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy. Pg. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
'''William Taub-''' Based on [[Philip Rahv]], McCarthy's ex-lover and editor at [[Partisan Review|''The Partisan Review'',]] Taub is the leader of the Realist faction of Utopia. As the victim of the book's most “outrageous satire,”&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs-Abrams, Pg. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Taub is depicted as cowardly, lazy, self-centered, and villainous, amounting to a “not especially flattering depiction”&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, George. “Nicola Chiaromonte, the Politics Circle, and the Search for a Postwar ‘Third Camp.’”&lt;/ref&gt; of the jaded [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist.]] Convinced that the “potency of history” will prove the “failure of socialism,”&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Mary. The Oasis. Pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Taub is fixated on seeing Utopia fail.

'''Macdougal Macdermott-''' Serving as a stand-in for [[Dwight Macdonald]] (a friend of McCarthy's and the founder of the magazine ''[[Politics (magazine 1944–1949)|politics]]''), Macdermott is the leader of the Purist faction. Though Macdonald is not lampooned to the same degree that Rahv is, the character of Macdermott is hot-tempered, blindly committed to being consistent in his libertarian views, and susceptible to being roped into Taub's political chess match.

'''Joe Lockman-''' A “[[Capitalism|capitalist]] monad” who “sets the purists’ symbolic tests,” Joe’s impulsive nature pushes the ideological imperatives of both the Realists and the Purists to their limits.&lt;ref&gt;Wilford, Hugh. “An Oasis: The New York Intellectuals in the Late 1940s.” Pg. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; He represents the layman, the non-intellectual, and the growing professional class that is discovering the merits of [[Modernism|modernist]] thought and expression.

'''Katy Norell-''' A libertarian idealist dedicated to the purist faction and stuck in a fractious marriage, Katy resembles McCarthy in 1949 more closely than any other character in ''The Oasis''. Katy provides the book’s strongest feminine perspective and feminist argument, “reveal[ing] much remains to be learned about women’s rights in [Utopia].”&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs-Abrams, Pg. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Large sections of ''The Oasis'' hold little narrative distance from Katy, as the reader sees the mission of the commune fall apart through Katy's eyes towards the end of the novel.

'''Jim Haines-''' A handsome magazine editor whose departure from Utopia portends the beginning of the end of Utopia.

'''Susan Hapgood-''' A novelist and follower of the Realist faction who dotes on Taub, Susan is perhaps meant to represent the younger McCarthy, or perhaps [[Elizabeth Hardwick (writer)|Elizabeth Hardwick]], McCarthy's friend and fellow novelist.

'''Harold Sidney-''' Based on [[William Phillips (editor)|William Phillips]], a co-editor of ''The Partisan Review'' with Philip Rahv, Sidney is Taub's second-in-command. Though less capricious than Taub, he is equally conniving, and, when the time comes for him to speak out against Lockman, Macdermott, and the Purists, he is also equally inept.

'''Leo Raphael-''' Inspired by discussion of the commune's greater purpose, Leo proposes that the Utopians refocus their energies on a United States of Europe in Exile, in which the commune can act as a model for European refugees who wish to escape the threat of communism and settle in America.

'''Monteverdi, “the Founder”-''' Based on [[Nicola Chiaromonte]]. While he does not make any actual appearance in Utopia, the Founder is seen as a sort of prophet by the Purists, his absence leaving them directionless.

== Publishing History ==
''The Oasis'' was originally published as an ongoing series under the name ''A Source of Embarrassment'' by the British literary magazine [[Horizon (magazine)|''Horizon''.]]&lt;ref&gt;Grumbach, Doris. The Company She Kept: Mary McCarthy, Herself and Her Writings. Pg. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published by Random House in 1949. Though its initial circulation was limited, the novel was reissued by [[Melville House Publishing|Melville House]] in 2013 as part of its “Neversink Library” series.

== Historical Background ==
Following the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]] in the summer of 1945, which McCarthy referred to as a “watershed, a dividing line,”&lt;ref&gt;Sumner. Pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; many of the [[The New York Intellectuals|New York Intellectuals]]—a group, which included McCarthy, of contributors to ''politics'', ''Partisan Review'', and other preeminent New York writers and thinkers—became alarmed by the rapidly escalating [[nuclear arms race]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. As many of the New York Intellectuals were formerly avowed [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] Communists,&lt;ref&gt;Wilford. Pg. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; the group became attracted to the idea of retreating from society at large and participating in small-scale communal living. Concerning the period immediately following the war, McCarthy would later remark: “It seemed possible still, utopian but possible, to change the world on a small scale.”&lt;ref&gt;Sumner. Pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer, McCarthy and her fellow New York Intellectuals, under the guidance of activist Nicola Chiaromonte, established the European-American Group (EAG) in an effort to create “human-scaled, grassroots, transnational communities of dialogue and solidarity.” This effort towards small-scale living, however, was short lived. Soon after its founding, the EAG disbanded “due to a lack of internal consensus about its goals,” as “the Macdonald-McCarthy-Chiaromonte faction” failed to find common ground with the so-called “''Partisan Review'' Boys,” Philip Rahv and William Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner. Pg. 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt; As Hugh Wilford contends in his historio-literary analysis of ''The Oasis'', “An Oasis: The New York Intellectuals in the Late 1940s,” the dissolution of the EAG marked the beginning of the cooptation of [[Old Left]] holdouts such as McCarthy and her contemporaries into a larger liberal, post-World War II consensus. In fact, many members of the EAG would become key figures in the creation of the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] (CCF), a front organization designed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] for the purposes of winning the [[Cultural Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilford. Pg. 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few years later, in the spring of 1949, McCarthy—along with Dwight Mcdonald, Elizabeth Hardwick, [[Sidney Hook]], and other former EAG members—would help disrupt a communist conference held at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.]]&lt;ref&gt;Grumbach. Pg. 147-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreseeing this eventual shift, McCarthy spent her final days in the EAG documenting the group's failures through her writing of ''The Oasis''.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner. Pg. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
''The Oasis'' has been described as “an imaginative inquiry into the causes of radical failure,”&lt;ref&gt;Wilford. Pg. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; a satirical critique of the limitations of intellectual debate and the ability for intellectuals to enact actual change, as well as a condemnation of communal and political organization in general. For the latter reason, much has been written on the relationship between ''The Oasis'' and the philosophy of McCarthy's longtime friend, historian [[Hannah Arendt]]. In “Social Utopia: Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy’s ''The Oasis'',” Nicholas Spencer argues that both Arendt and McCarthy are wary of the propensity of political groups towards “altruistic fervor” and injecting their “personal conduct” with “general objectivity”.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer. Pg. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Since neither believes that the convictions of political groups can withstand social and personal pressure enacted by the individuals that compose these groups, both favor a “solitude over solidarity” model. Both Arendt and McCarthy view the role of the group as “anesthetic,” and believe that an individual's “yielding” to facts in the service of “self-alteration” is a superior method of self-improvement than group organizing. This ideology is mirrored by and made manifest in McCarthy's unremitting prose, most evidently in ''The Oasis''.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Deborah. “The Virtues of Heartlessness: Mary McCarthy, Hannah Arendt, and the Anesthetics of Empathy.”&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical Response ==
Reception of ''The Oasis'' has been historically mixed. Response to the novel's earliest incarnation, in ''Horizon'' magazine, was generally positive.&lt;ref&gt;Gornick, Vivian. “The Company They Kept.” The New Yorker.&lt;/ref&gt; American critics, however, were less kind. In a tepid review published by ''[[The New York Times]]'', critic Donald Barr wrote, “readers outside [McCarthy’s] circle can get little from ''The Oasis'' except a vague sense of defamatory brilliance and a few fine scenes.”&lt;ref&gt;Barr, Donald. “Failure in Utopia.” The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Hannah Arendt looked favorably on ''The Oasis'', calling it “a gem,”&lt;ref&gt;Grumbach. Pg. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; many of McCarthy's closest friends were offended by the novel, most notably those who were implicated in the book's plot. Dwight Macdonald called the book “vicious, malicious, and nasty,” while [[Diana Trilling]] labeled McCarthy “a thug.”&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/oasis/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Bellow]] found Rahv's portrayal to be a “stupid caricature,”&lt;ref&gt;Wilford. Pg. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; with Rahv himself threatening to sue McCarthy for [[Defamation|libel]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer. Pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Oasis'' has experienced something of a resurgence in recent years. Melville House reissued the book in 2013 as part of its Neversink Library series, which “champions books from around the world that have been overlooked, under appreciated, looked askance at, or foolishly ignored.”&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.mhpbooks.com/series/the-neversink-library/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the book has experienced an upswing in scholarly interest over the past thirty years. In her preface to the 2013 edition of ''The Oasis'', [[Vivian Gornick]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;“many American critics… pronounced [''The Oasis''] brilliant but heartless. They were wrong. The book is not heartless. It is not out for blood. True, irony inevitably means some fundamental sympathy is being withheld, but the irony here is not savage. Its deliciously witty sentence structure is rooted in the heartfelt disappointment of a moralist whom the reader feels has really wanted the good (that is, the genuine) in our midst to prevail.”&lt;ref&gt;Gornick. “The Company She Kept.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Satanic Bible''''' is a collection of essays, observations, and [[ritual]]s published by [[Anton LaVey]] in 1969. It is the central [[religious text]] of [[LaVeyan Satanism]], and is considered the foundation of its [[philosophy]] and [[dogma]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p = 105}} It has been described as the most important document to influence contemporary Satanism.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p = 116}} Though ''The Satanic Bible'' is not considered to be [[religious text|sacred scripture]] in the way that the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian Bible]] is to [[Christianity]], LaVeyan Satanists regard it as an authoritative text{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p = 105}} as it is a contemporary text that has attained for them scriptural status.{{sfn|Gallagher|2013|p = 121}} It extols the virtues of exploring one's own nature and instincts. Believers have been described as "[[Atheism|atheistic]] Satanists"{{sfn|Muzzatti|2005|p = 874}} because they believe that [[God]] is not an external entity, but rather something that each person creates as a projection of their own personality—a benevolent and stabilizing force in their life.{{sfn|Wright|1993|p = 143}}{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p = 40}} There have been thirty [[print run|printings]] of ''The Satanic Bible'',{{sfn|Hallman|2006|p=115}} through which it has sold over a million copies.{{sfn|Mathews|2009|p=54}}

''The Satanic Bible'' is composed of four books: ''The Book of Satan'', ''The Book of Lucifer'', ''The Book of Belial'', and ''The Book of Leviathan''. ''The Book of Satan'' challenges the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Golden Rule]], and promotes [[Epicureanism]].{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=30}} ''The Book of Lucifer'' holds most of the philosophy in ''The Satanic Bible'', with twelve chapters discussing topics such as indulgence, love, hate, and sex. LaVey also uses the book to dispel rumors surrounding the religion. In ''The Book of Belial'', LaVey details rituals and magic. He discusses the required mindset and focus for performing a ritual, and provides instructions for three rituals: those for sex, compassion, or destruction.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=121–140}} ''The Book of Leviathan'' provides four [[invocation]]s for Satan, lust, compassion, and destruction.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=144–152}} It also lists the nineteen Enochian Keys (adapted from [[John Dee]]'s [[Enochian magic|Enochian keys]]), provided both in [[Enochian]] and in English translation.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=157–272}}

There have been both positive and negative reactions to ''The Satanic Bible''. It has been described as "razor-sharp"{{sfn|Metzger|2008|p=278}} and "influential".{{sfn|Bromley|2005|pp=8127–8128}} Criticism of ''The Satanic Bible'' stems both from qualms over LaVey's writing and disapproval of the content itself. LaVey has been criticized for [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] sections,{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=49}} and accusations have been made that his philosophies are largely borrowed.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=113–115}}{{sfn|Schreck|Schreck|1998}} ''The Satanic Bible'' has been heavily condemned as dangerous, particularly to adolescents.{{sfn|Linedecker|1991|pp=77–95}} Attempts have been made to ban the book in schools, public libraries, and prisons,{{sfn|Steinberg|1986}}{{sfn|Lam|1999}}{{sfn|Bogan|2011}} though these attempts are somewhat rare.{{sfn|Taub|Nelson|1993|p=530}}

==History==

There are multiple stories of the birth of ''The Satanic Bible''. In the introduction to the 2005–present edition, High Priest [[Peter H. Gilmore]] describes LaVey as having compiled ''The Satanic Bible'' on his own from [[monograph]]s he had written about the Church of Satan and its rituals. Gilmore lists a number of people who influenced LaVey's writings: [[Ayn Rand]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[H. L. Mencken]], the members of the carnival with whom LaVey had supposedly worked in his youth, [[P. T. Barnum]], [[Mark Twain]], [[John Milton]], and [[Lord Byron]].{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=14}}

LaVey's estranged daughter [[Zeena Schreck]], in an exposé about both her father's religion and past, attributes the birth of ''The Satanic Bible'' to a suggestion by [[Peter Mayer]], a publisher for [[Avon (publishers)|Avon]].{{sfn|Schreck|Schreck|1998}} According to Schreck, Mayer proposed that LaVey author a Satanic Bible to draw from the popularity of the 1968 horror film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', which had caused a recent rise in public interest in both [[Satanism]] and other [[occult]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;There is some disagreement over this claim: Gilmore states in the introduction that it was in fact LaVeyan Satanism that influenced ''Rosemary's Baby''.&lt;/ref&gt; Schreck states that, aided by [[Diane Hegarty]], LaVey compiled a number of writings he had already been distributing: an introduction to Satanism, a number of short essays, a guide to ritual magic, and articles he had previously published in ''The Cloven Hoof'', a [[Church of Satan]] newsletter.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=192}}{{sfn|Schreck|Schreck|1998}}

Either to meet length requirements set by the publisher{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=49}} or out of agreement with the ideas,{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=14}} LaVey and Hegarty borrowed heavily from writings by other authors. These included a [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] book published in 1890 entitled ''[[Might Is Right]]'' by Ragnar Redbeard, as well as Dee's Enochian keys from [[Aleister Crowley]]'s ''[[The Equinox]]'', modified to replace references to Christianity with those to Satan.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}} Some accuse LaVey of [[paraphrase|paraphrasing]] the ''Nine Satanic Statements'' from Rand's ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' without acknowledgement, though others maintain that LaVey was simply drawing inspiration from the novel.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=113}}{{sfn|Petersen|2009|p=50}} LaVey later affirmed the connection with Rand's ideas by stating that LaVeyan Satanism was "just Ayn Rand's philosophy, with ceremony and ritual added".{{sfn|Ellis|2000|p=180}}

===Publication history===
Originally published in paperback by Avon in 1969, ''The Satanic Bible'' has had thirty printings{{sfn|Hallman|2006|p=115}} and has never gone out of print.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=146}} A hardcover edition was published by University Books that same year but has now been out of print for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shoup|first1=Leonard|title=The Satanic Bible by Anton Szandor LaVey - the Rare Hardcover 1st Edition|url=http://www.biblio.com/the-satanic-bible-by-lavey-anton-szandor/work/39572|website=Biblio|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, William Morrow published a new hardcover edition of the book combined in a single volume with its companion work, ''The Satanic Rituals'', and marketed under a special arrangement by Rabid Crow Arts and Graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satanic Bible Hardcover|url=http://www.rabidcrow.com/#!satanic-bible-hard-cover/ccqv|website=Rabid Crow Arts and Graphics|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main content has not changed throughout the editions, although the dedication was removed after several printings and the introduction has changed several times.{{sfn|Mathews|2009|pp=54–56}} The [[Sigil of Baphomet]] has been printed on the cover since the original publication.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|pp=20–21}} ''The Satanic Bible'' has sold over one million copies since its initial release.{{sfn|Mathews|2009|pp=54–56}} It has also been translated into Danish, Swedish, German, Spanish, Finnish and Turkish.{{sfn|Ankarloo|Clark|1999|p=95}}

==Content==

===Dedication===
Though it is no longer included in current printings of ''The Satanic Bible'', early printings included an extensive dedication to various people whom LaVey recognized as influences. LaVey's primary dedication was to [[Bernardino Nogara]] (misprinted as "Logara"), [[Karl Haushofer]], [[Grigori Rasputin]], [[Basil Zaharoff]], [[Alessandro Cagliostro]], [[Barnabas]], [[Might Is Right|Ragnar Redbeard]], [[William Mortensen]], Hans Brick, [[Max Reinhardt]], Orrin Klapp, [[Fritz Lang]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[W. C. Fields]], [[P. T. Barnum]], [[Hans Poelzig]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Wilhelm Reich]], and [[Mark Twain]]. The secondary dedication named [[Howard Hughes]], James Moody, [[Marcello Truzzi]], Adrian‐Claude Frazier, [[Marilyn Monroe]], Wesley Mather, [[William Lindsay Gresham]], [[Hugo Zacchini]], [[Jayne Mansfield]], Frederick Goerner, C. Huntley, [[Nathanael West]], [[Horatio Alger|Horatio Alger Jr.]], [[Robert E. Howard]], [[George Orwell]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Tuesday Weld]], [[H. G. Wells]], Sister Marie Koven, [[Harry Houdini]], Togare (LaVey's pet lion), and the Nine Unknown Men from ''[[The Nine Unknown]]''.{{sfn|LaVey|1969}}

===Introductions===
Throughout the various printings of ''The Satanic Bible'', it has included introductions by various authors. The first edition (in print from 1969 to 1972) included an excerpt from an article by Burton H. Wolfe, an [[investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] and biographer of LaVey, entitled "The Church that Worships Satan". Wolfe provides an extensive biography of LaVey and a history of the Church of Satan. He mentions ''Rosemary's Baby'' as contributing to the popularity of Satanism, though he does not claim LaVeyan Satanism to have directly influenced its creation.{{sfn|LaVey|1969|pp=13–16}} From 1972 until 1976, the introduction to ''The Satanic Bible'' was a piece by Michael A. Aquino, who later went on to found the [[Temple of Set]] with a number of members of the Church of Satan. He gives a detailed analysis of the Satanic philosophies, and dispels myths about LaVeyan Satanism. He explains that it is not "[[devil worship]]", and that LaVeyan Satanists in fact reject the worship of external gods completely. He too provides a brief background on LaVey, explaining how LaVey brought some of the knowledge he had acquired while working with the circus to his religion.{{sfn|LaVey|1972}} Wolfe again wrote the introduction for the 1976 to 2005 editions of ''The Satanic Bible''. It included some of the same content as the 1969 version, with an expanded biography of LaVey and more information on the various conflicts between other religions and LaVeyan Satanism.{{sfn|LaVey|1976}} Since 2005, ''The Satanic Bible'' has contained an introduction written by Gilmore, High Priest of the Church of Satan. In this introduction, he discusses his discovery of LaVeyan Satanism and his relationship with LaVey. He then goes on to provide a detailed biography of LaVey and addresses allegations that LaVey falsified much of the story of his own past. The introduction also provides a history of ''The Satanic Bible'' itself, as well as that of two other books by LaVey: ''[[The Satanic Witch]]'' and ''[[The Satanic Rituals]]''.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=18}}

===Preface===
LaVey explains his reasons for writing ''The Satanic Bible'' in a short preface. He speaks skeptically about volumes written by other authors on the subject of magic,{{sfn|Mathews|2009|p=55}} dismissing them as "nothing more than sanctimonious fraud" and "volumes of hoary misinformation and false prophecy". He complains that other authors do no more than confuse the subject. He mocks those who spend large amounts of money on attempts to follow rituals and learn about the magic shared in other occult books. He also notes that many of the existing writings on Satanic magic and ideology were created by "[[Left-hand path and right-hand path#Right-Hand Path|right-hand path]]" authors. He tells that ''The Satanic Bible'' contains both truth and fantasy, and declares, "What you see may not always please you, but you ''will see''!"{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=21–22}}

===Prologue===
The prologue to ''The Satanic Bible'' begins by discussing the concept of gods, good and evil, and human nature. It includes the Nine Satanic Statements: 
{{blockquote| 
#Satan represents indulgence, instead of abstinence!
#Satan represents vital existence, instead of spiritual pipe dreams!
#Satan represents undefiled wisdom, instead of hypocritical self-deceit!
#Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of love wasted on ingrates!
#Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning the other cheek!
#Satan represents responsibility to the responsible, instead of concern for psychic vampires!
#Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his "divine spiritual and intellectual development," has become the most vicious animal of all!
#Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!
#Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these years!{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=25}}}}

The Nine Satanic Statements outline the basic ideology of LaVeyan Satanism, and have become some of the guiding principles of LaVeyan Satanism. They also served as a template for later publications by LaVey, such as his 1987 "Nine Satanic Sins".{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=192}} [[Ayn Rand]]'s influence on LaVeyan Satanism is apparent in the Nine Satanic Statements, leading some, namely [[Nikolas Schreck]], to assert that the Statements are simply unacknowledged paraphrase of Rand's thoughts.{{sfn|Schreck|Schreck|1998}} These accusations have been disproved, however.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=9}}

===''The Book of Satan''===
Much of the first book of ''The Satanic Bible'' is taken from parts of Redbeard's ''[[Might Is Right]]'', edited to remove [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], and [[misogyny]].{{sfn|Redbeard|1927|p=12}}{{sfn|Gallagher|2013|p=120}} It challenges both the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, advocating instead a tooth-for-tooth philosophy. LaVey, through Redbeard, strongly advocates social Darwinism, saying, "Death to the weakling, wealth to the strong!"{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=30}} Humans are identified as instinctually predatory, and "lust and carnal desire" are singled out as part of humans' intrinsic nature.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=32}} ''The Book of Satan'' suggests a hedonistic outlook, saying, "I break away from all conventions that do not lead to my earthly happiness." Indulgence is endorsed, and readers are encouraged to make the most of their lives. It criticizes both law and religious principles, instead suggesting doing only what makes one happy and successful. LaVey continues to denounce other religions, and he rails against what he considers to be arbitrary definitions of "good" and "evil".{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=30}} Religion is criticized as a man-made construct, and the reader is urged to question everything and destroy any lies that he or she uncovers. Long-standing lies that are believed to be irrefutable truths are identified as the most dangerous.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=31–32}} The last part of ''The Book of Satan'' is an adaptation of the Christian [[Beatitudes]], changed to reflect the principles of LaVeyan Satanism.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=34–35}}

===''The Book of Lucifer''===
''The Book of Lucifer'' contains the majority of the philosophy of ''The Satanic Bible''. It details how Christianity has taught that God is good and [[Satan]] is evil,{{sfn|Steiger|Steiger|2003|p=301}} and presents an alternate view. It describes that the concept of Satan, used synonymously with "God", is different for each LaVeyan Satanist, but that to all it represents a good and steadying force in their life. Believers have been called "atheistic Satanists" because of this lack of belief in external gods,{{sfn|Muzzatti|2005|p=874}} but others identify as [[antitheism|antitheistic]].{{sfn|Abma|2011}} Satan is seen to LaVeyan Satanists not as "an anthropomorphic being with cloven hooves, a barbed tail, and horns", but as a force of nature that has only been described as evil by other religions.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=62}} Satan is viewed as a metaphor{{sfn|Abma|2011}} or a symbol, not as a being to be worshipped.{{sfn|Perlmutter|LaVey|2003}}

LaVey rejects the idea of prayer, instead urging Satanists to take action to fix a situation instead of asking for a solution.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=40–41}} The [[seven deadly sins]] are advocated, on the basis that they all lead to personal pleasure. He says that Satanism is a form of "controlled selfishness", in the sense that doing something to help another will in turn make one happy. The Golden Rule is again mentioned, and LaVey suggests altering it from "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" to "Do unto others as they do unto you" so that if someone is treated poorly, he or she can respond viciously.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=51}} ''The Book of Lucifer'' also contains a list of "The Four Crown Princes of Hell" (Satan, [[Lucifer]], [[Belial]], and [[Leviathan]]){{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=57}} and of seventy-seven "[[The infernal names|Infernal Names]]", representations of Satan from various cultures and religions.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=58–60}} They are the names that, according to LaVey, are most useful in Satanic rituals.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=57}}

''The Book of Lucifer'' contains a long chapter titled "Satanic Sex", discussing Satanism's view on sexual activity as well as misconceptions surrounding these views. He denies the belief that sex is the most important element in LaVeyan Satanism, and that participation in [[orgy|orgies]] or other promiscuous behavior is forced. He explains that sexual freedom is encouraged, but only in the sense that believers should be free to explore their own [[Human sexual activity|sexualities]] as they please, without harming others.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=66–74}} Along with the rumors regarding Satanic views on sex, LaVey also addresses those about animal and human [[sacrifice]]. He explains that the only time a LaVeyan Satanist would perform a [[human sacrifice]] would be to accomplish two goals: to "release the magician's wrath" as he or she performed a curse, and to kill someone who deserved to die. He considers the action of hurting another person a request to be destroyed, and explains that the Satanist is morally required to grant this request in the form of a curse. LaVey also says that a Satanist would never sacrifice a baby or an animal, as they are pure carnal beings and considered to be sacred.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=87–90}} In ''The Book of Lucifer'', LaVey outlines LaVeyan Satanism's views on death. He explains that one who has lived a full life will dread death, and that this is the way it should be. He also does not agree with the idea of [[reincarnation]]. He encourages a strong will to live, comparing it to animals' instincts to fight viciously for their lives. Suicide is discouraged except in cases of [[euthanasia]], where it would end extreme suffering.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=91–95}} Because the Satanist is considered their own god, birthdays are celebrated as the most important holidays. Following one's birthday in importance are [[Walpurgisnacht]] and [[Halloween]]. [[Solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es are also celebrated.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=96–98}}

===''The Book of Belial''===
The third book of ''The Satanic Bible'' describes rituals and magic.{{sfn|Steiger|Steiger|2003|p=301}} According to Joshua Gunn, these are adapted from books of ritual magic such as Crowley's ''[[Magick (Book 4)#Part II: Magick (Elementary Theory)|Magick: Elementary Theory]]''.{{sfn|Gunn|2005|p=102}} ''The Satanic Rituals'', published by LaVey in 1972, outlines the rituals more precisely, and contains the entire text of the Black Mass.{{sfn|Steiger|Steiger|2003|p=302}} LaVey begins ''The Book of Belial'' by defining magic as "The change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable."{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=110}} He explains that some of the rituals are simply applied psychology or science, but that some contain parts with no scientific basis.

LaVey explains that, in order to control a person, one must first attract their attention. He gives three qualities that can be employed for this purpose: sex appeal, sentiment (cuteness or innocence), and wonder. He also advocates the use of odor.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=111–113}} In the ''Book of Belial'', he discusses three types of rituals: those for sex, compassion, and destruction. Sex rituals work to entice another person; compassion rituals work to improve health, intelligence, success, and so on; destruction rituals work to destroy another person.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=114–117}} LaVey advocates finding others with whom to practice Satanic rituals in order to reaffirm one's faith and avoid antisocial behavior. He particularly advocates group participation for destruction rituals, as compassion and sex rituals are more private in nature.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=119}} LaVey goes on to list the key components to successful ritual: desire, timing, imagery, direction, and "The Balance Factor" (awareness of one's own limitations).{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=121–128}} Details for the various Satanic rituals are explained in ''The Book of Belial'', and lists of necessary objects (such as clothing, altars, and the symbol of [[Baphomet]]) are given.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=130–136}}

===''The Book of Leviathan''===
The final book of ''The Satanic Bible'' emphasizes the importance of spoken word and emotion to effective magic.{{sfn|Steiger|Steiger|2003|p=301}} An "Invocation to Satan" as well as three invocations for the three types of ritual are given.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=144–152}} The "Invocation to Satan" commands the dark forces to grant power to the summoner, and lists the Infernal names for use in the invocation. The "Invocation employed towards the conjuration of lust" is used for attracting the attentions of another. Both male and female versions of the invocation are provided. The "Invocation employed towards the conjuration of destruction" commands the dark forces to destroy the subject of the invocation. The "Invocation employed towards the conjuration of compassion" requests protection, health, strength, and the destruction of anything ailing the subject of the invocation.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=144–152}} The rest of ''The Book of Leviathan'' is composed of the Enochian Keys, which LaVey adapted from Dee's original work. They are given in Enochian and also translated into English.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=155–272}} LaVey provides a brief introduction that credits Dee and explains some of the history behind the Enochian Keys and language. He maintains that the translations provided are an "unvarnishing" of the translations performed by the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] in the 1800s,{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=155}} but others accuse LaVey of simply changing references to Christianity with those to Satan.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=112}}

==Themes==

===God and Satan===
''The Satanic Bible'' often uses the terms "God" and "Satan" interchangeably,{{sfn|Muzzatti|2005|p=874}} except when referring to the concepts of these as viewed by other religions. LaVey also occasionally uses the term "God" to refer to other religions' views of God, and "Satan" or synonyms to refer to the idea of god as interpreted by LaVeyan Satanism, as when he writes, "When all religious faith in lies has waned, it is because man has become closer to himself and farther from 'God'; closer to the 'Devil.'"{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=45}} Throughout ''The Satanic Bible'', the LaVeyan Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true "self"—a projection of their own personality—not an external deity.{{sfn|Wright|1993|p=143}} Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism.{{sfn|Cavaglion|Sela-Shayovitz|2005|p=255}} Satan is also used as a metaphor for the ideas connected with the early Christian view of Satan or the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]]: wise, defiant, questioning, and free-thinking.{{sfn|Hughes|2011|p=1}} LaVey discusses this extensively in ''The Book of Lucifer'', explaining that the gods worshipped by other religions are also projections of man's true self. He argues that man's unwillingness to accept his own ego has caused him to externalize these gods so as to avoid the feeling of [[narcissism]] that would accompany self-worship.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|pp=44–45}}
{{quote|1=If man insists on externalizing his true self in the form of "God," then why fear his true self, in fearing "God,"—why praise his true self in praising "God,"—why remain externalized from "God" {{smallcaps|in order to engage in ritual and religious ceremony in his name?}}&lt;br /&gt;Man needs ritual and dogma, but no law states that an ''externalized'' god is necessary in order to engage in ritual and ceremony performed in a god's name! Could it be that when he closes the gap between himself and his "God" he sees the demon of pride creeping forth—that very embodiment of Lucifer appearing in his midst?|2=Anton LaVey|3=''The Satanic Bible'', pp. 44–45}}
Though at some points LaVey refers to Satan as a physical being, this is intended to encourage the Satanist's "rational self-interest."{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=291}}

===Science===
Many of the ideas in ''The Satanic Bible'' are shaped around a [[secularism|secular]], scientific view of the world. However, some of these ideas continue beyond present-day secularism by implying that various occult forces are not supernatural, but rather thus far undiscovered by science.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|pp=3–4}} These forces are said to be manipulable by the practitioner of LaVeyan Satanism, a trait of the religion that has been compared with [[Christian Science]] and [[Scientology]].{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}}

James Lewis argues that scientific themes are so prevalent in ''The Satanic Bible'' because LaVey was appealing to the authority of science to legitimize Satanism as a religion.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=14}}

===Human nature and Social Darwinism===
Social Darwinism and the concept of "human nature" are ideas that are prevalent throughout ''The Satanic Bible''. LaVey describes Satanism as "a religion based on the universal traits of man,"{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=53}} and humans are described throughout as inherently carnal and animalistic. Each of the seven deadly sins is described as part of human's natural instinct, and are thus advocated.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=46}} Social Darwinism is particularly noticeable in ''The Book of Satan'', where LaVey plagiarizes portions of Redbeard's ''[[Might Is Right]]'', though it also appears throughout in references to man's inherent strength and instinct for self-preservation.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}}{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=47}} LaVeyan Satanism has been described as "institutionalism of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] self-interest" because of many of these themes.{{sfn|Taub|Nelson|1993|p=528}}

==Influence==
''The Satanic Bible'' is recognized as one of the key texts of modern Satanism.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Petersen|2009|p=52}}{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=225}} The Church of Satan requires that people accept "LaVey's principles" before becoming members of the church. Many other Satanist groups and individual Satanists who are not part of the Church of Satan also recognize LaVey's work as influential.{{sfn|Mathews|2009|p=4}} Many Satanists attribute their conversions or discoveries of Satanism to ''The Satanic Bible'', with 20% of respondents to a survey by James Lewis mentioning ''The Satanic Bible'' directly as influencing their conversion.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=117}}
In Gilmore's introduction, he lists a number of novels and films supposedly influenced by ''The Satanic Bible'' and LaVeyan Satanism. These include the novels ''[[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' by [[Ira Levin]] and ''[[Our Lady of Darkness]]'' by [[Fritz Leiber]], as well as films such as ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[The Devil's Rain]]'', ''[[The Car]]'', and ''Dr. Dracula''.{{sfn|LaVey|2005|p=15}} Others have lauded ''The Satanic Bible'' as heavily influential on [[heavy metal music|metal]] and [[rock music|rock]] bands{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=9}} such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Venom (band)|Venom]],{{sfn|Cope|2010|p=83,104}} [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]],{{sfn|Kajzer|Lotring|2009|p=109}} and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]].{{sfn|Petersen|2009|p=205}}

==Reception==
[[Richard Metzger]] describes ''The Satanic Bible'' as "a razor-sharp, no-bullshit primer in [[natural law|natural]] and [[divine law|supernatural law]]."{{sfn|Metzger|2008|p=278}} [[David G. Bromley]] calls it "[[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]]" and "the best-known and most influential statement of Satanic theology."{{sfn|Bromley|2005|pp=8127–8128}} [[Eugene V. Gallagher]] says that Satanists use LaVey's writings "as lenses through which they view themselves, their group, and the cosmos." He also states: "With a clear-eyed appreciation of true human nature, a love of ritual and pageantry, and a flair for mockery, LaVey's ''Satanic Bible'' promulgated a gospel of self-indulgence that, he argued, anyone who dispassionately considered the facts would embrace."{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|p=6530}} The philosophy it presents has been described as "strident [[libertarianism]]" and "an obvious distillation of ideas common among members of the United States [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counter-culture in the 1960s]]."{{sfn|Gunn|2005|pp=102–103}} Joshua Gunn argues that the significance of ''The Satanic Bible'' as an occult item owes to its status as a "[[totem]] or a [[fetishism|fetishized]] object in popular culture", not the philosophy contained within. He argues that many erroneously categorize the content of ''The Satanic Bible'' as evil and depraved from the minimalist, dark cover design (composed of a purple Sigil of Baphomet and white text on the front, and a photo of LaVey superimposed over the Sigil of Baphomet on the back), the verbose, overblown style of the text, and the presence of the word "Satan" in the title. Contrary to this belief, he says, the philosophy presented by LaVey is "neither offensive nor surprising."{{sfn|Gunn|2005|pp=102–105}}

[[Zeena Schreck]] has criticized ''The Satanic Bible'' as a financial endeavor suggested by Avon publisher, Mayer. She maintains that it contains large amounts of falsified information about LaVey's past, and that much of the book is plagiarized from Redbeard's ''[[Might Is Right]]'', Dee's Enochian Keys, and Rand's ''Atlas Shrugged''.{{sfn|Schreck|Schreck|1998}} Chris Mathews, in ''Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture'', describes ''The Satanic Bible'' as "hastily prepared" and cynical. Both Mathews and a 1971 article in ''[[Newsweek]]'' compare the ideologies presented in ''The Satanic Bible'' to [[Nazism]]: containing "unremitting focus on social elitism, appeals to force, and scorn for egalitarian principles".{{sfn|Mathews|2009|p=xvii}} [[Israel Regardie]] criticized LaVey's alteration of the Enochian Keys in ''The Book of Leviathan'' as stupid and of lower quality than the original Keys.{{sfn|Mathews|2009|p=56}}

''The Satanic Bible'' has also received a large amount of criticism from people and organizations who find its content to be dangerous. Much of this criticism came during the period of "[[Satanic ritual abuse#As a moral panic|Satanic panic]]," when [[Satanic ritual abuse]] was feared to be epidemic.{{sfn|Versluis|2006|p=116}} Much of this media coverage, however, has been denounced as "uncritical and sensationalized."{{sfn|Taub|Nelson|1993|p=531}} [[Tom Harpur]] condemns the book as "blasphemous" and "socially seditious," and blames it for causing an increase in gruesome violence, ritual abuse, and other obscene acts.{{sfn|Harpur|1989}} Critics have also accused ''The Satanic Bible'' of encouraging violence and murder, particularly in young people considered to be impressionable.{{sfn|Linedecker|1991|pp=77–95}} Dawn Perlmutter criticizes it for providing adolescents with bad messages and messages that can be easily misinterpreted.{{sfn|Perlmutter|LaVey|2003}} Possession of ''The Satanic Bible'' has been used by some studies to identify adolescents who are [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]],{{sfn|Swatos|1992|p=162}} and some warn that possession of the book is a warning sign of emotional issues.{{sfn|Brown|1989}} The Council on Mind Abuse took a very negative view of ''The Satanic Bible''. Former Executive Director Rob Tucker warned parents to look for ''The Satanic Bible'' in their children's bedrooms, saying, "You have to help the child fight this obsession like any other addiction"{{sfn|Brown|1989}} and "It's like giving drugs to a kid who is already on the edge."{{sfn|MacLeod|1990}} Attempts to ban the book from schools and public libraries have been made in various places around the world,{{sfn|Steinberg|1986}}{{sfn|Lam|1999}} and bans or limitations on the book in prisons have been repeatedly challenged in court.{{sfn|Bogan|2011}}{{sfn|USA Today|1990}}{{sfn|Associated Press|1990}} However, opposition to ''The Satanic Bible'' has rarely led to its removal; these bans are rare.{{sfn|Taub|Nelson|1993|p=530}} The book was banned in [[South Africa]] from 1973 to 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Censored publications: ID 9914286|url=http://search.beaconforfreedom.org/search/censored_publications/publication.html?id=9914286|publisher=Beacon for Freedom of Expression|accessdate=4 May 2013|quote=Period of censorship: June 22, 1973 – January 22, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Treatise on Tolerance on the Occasion of the Death of Jean Calas from the Judgment Rendered in Toulouse''''' (''Pieces Originales Concernant la Mort des Sieurs Calas det le Jugement rendu a Toulouse'')  is a work by French philosopher [[Voltaire]], published in 1763, in which he calls for tolerance between religions, and targets religious [[fanaticism]], especially that of the [[Jesuit]]s (under whom Voltaire received his early education), indicting all [[superstition]]s surrounding religions.

==Background==

Voltaire's work follows the trial of [[Jean Calas]] (1698-1762), a Protestant accused of murdering his son Marc-Antoine to prevent his conversion to the Church and executed in [[Toulouse]] on March 10, 1762 despite enduring torture after the prosecution used perjured witnesses, in a case which Voltaire took to display Catholic prejudice and fanaticism.  In 1765, after the king fired the chief magistrate and the case was retried by another court, Calas was posthumously exonerated and his family paid 36 thousand francs.

Voltaire's argument is illustrated in the following passages:

"There are about forty millions of inhabitants in Europe who are not members of the Church of Rome; should we say to every one of them, 'Sir, since you are infallibly damned, I shall neither eat, converse, nor have any connections with you?'";

"O different worshippers of a peaceful God!  If you have a cruel heart, if, while you adore he whose whole law consists of these few words, "Love God and your neighbor'..."

"I see all the dead of past ages and of our own appearing in His presence.  Are you very sure that our Creator and Father will say to the wise and virtuous [[Confucius]], to the legislator [[Solon]], to [[Pythagoras]], [[Zaleucus]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], the divine [[Antonins]], the good [[Trajan]], to [[Titus]], the delights of mankind, to [[Epictetus]], and to many others, models of men: 'Go, monsters, go and suffer torments that are infinite in intensity and duration.  Let your punishment be eternal as I am.  But you, my beloved ones, [[Jean Châtel]], [[François Ravaillac|Ravaillac]], [[Robert-François Damiens|Damiens]], [[Louis Dominique Bourguignon|Cartouche]], etc. who have died according to the prescribed rules, sit forever at my right hand and share my empire and my felicity.'  You draw back with horror at these words; and after they have escaped me, I have nothing more to say to you."

==Publication and reception==
Voltaire finished the work by January 2, 1763, and it was printed by the [[Cramer brothers]] in Geneva in April 1763. After copies had been distributed to selected recipients include [[Madame de Pompadour]], ministers of the French privy council, the king of Prussia, and some German princes, it began to be distributed in October 1763 and was quickly banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Ian|title=Voltaire: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_p9Z8z9-wYC&amp;lpg=PA324&amp;dq=Voltaire%20Calas&amp;pg=PA328#v=onepage&amp;q=Voltaire%20Calas&amp;f=false|year=2010|publisher=Profile|isbn=1846682266|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Simon|title=Voltaire: Treatise on Tolerance (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnZNwHWdB-UC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Voltaire%20Calas&amp;pg=PR13#v=onepage&amp;q=Voltaire%20Calas&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521649692|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tržan Castle''' ({{IPA-sh|ˈtr̩̂ʒan|hr}};  {{lang-hr|Tržan-grad}} or ''Utvrda Tržan'') is a ruined [[medieval]] [[castle]] above the village of [[Modruš]] in the northern part of historical [[Lika region]], central [[Croatia]]. Before (from the 11th century) the administrative seat of the former Modruš County (later renamed [[Modruš-Rijeka County]]), it is today just a ruin in the [[Josipdol]] Municipality in the southern part of the [[Karlovac County]]. 

Having been built on a [[ridge]] of a steep hill {{convert|670|m|ft}} above sea level on the eastern slopes of the [[Velika Kapela]] mountain, the castle was at a strategic place overlooking the road that connected the [[Adriatic Sea]] and the [[Pannonian Basin]] since ancient times. The road in question connected the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] towns of Senia (present-day [[Senj]]) and [[Siscia]] (present-day [[Sisak]]). It was later, during the 18th century, reconstructed, improved and renamed as [[Josephina (road)|Josephina road]].

==History==

According to the famous Croatian historian [[Vjekoslav Klaić]] (1849–1928), a kind of a castle or [[fortification|stronghold]] most probably existed above Modruš already at the beginning of the 9th century, during a war between [[Borna of Croatia|Borna]], Duke of [[Dalmatian Croatia]], and [[Ljudevit Posavski]], Duke of [[Principality of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]].

Almost ideal position, dominating over the surrounding area, made Tržan Castle never to be conquered by anyone in its history, although the town of Modruš below the castle was plundered and burned by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1493, just before the [[battle of Krbava Field]].

From 1193 the castle was property of the [[Knez (title)|Knezes (Princes)]] of [[Krk]], (later, from around 1430, known as the [[House of Frankopan|Frankopans]]), a distinguished Croatian noble family. Bartol II Krčki /Bartholomew II of Krk/ was given the whole vast Modruš estate, including the castle, by the [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|Croato-Hungarian]] king [[Béla III of Hungary|Bella II (III)]] for his merits in the wars he fought. The next more than 350 years Tržan was owned by the Frankopans, not only as one among the many castles in their property, but as the main seat and stronghold of the family in the whole continental part of Croatia. From thence ruled, among others, [[Ivan V Krčki (Frankopan)|Ivan V Krčki]] /John V of Krk/ (born before 1343, died 1393) and his son [[Nikola Frankopan|Nikola IV]] /Nicholas IV/ (born around 1360, died 1432), the most powerful man in Croatia at the beginning of the 15th century, both [[Ban (title)|Bans (Viceroys)]] of [[Croatia]]. They reconstructed and enlarged the old, irregular shaped castle, which was from around 1437 called Tržan or Tržan-grad, because of an increased trade that was going on there ({{lang-hr|tržiti means to trade or to sell}}).

The [[wall]]s, [[bastion]]s and [[tower]]s were built of hewn stone ([[ashlar]]) in the „fishbone“ style and represented a kind of masterpiece of the contemporary building skill. There are some signs which indicate that the foreign building masters took part in the works, most probably those from the [[Republic of Venice]]. The castle itself consisted of central part with a large [[guard tower]] and a [[palace]] as residence for members of the princely family with its supporting staff, northern part with outbuildings for economic services, various [[workshop]]s, [[warehouse]]s, [[water tank]]s and rectangular defending tower, and southern part containing mostly facilities for [[retail trade]], accommodation for traders and travellers etc. Following the walls and bastions of the castle, there were [[defensive wall]]s, about {{convert|1200|m|ft}} long, around the town of Modruš, descending the slope of the hill.

In 1449 a well-known partition of the huge Frankopan estates, spread throughout central and western Croatia, took place, as the eight sons of Nikola IV Frankopan agreed to split and share their father`s property (legally valid) among themselves. In the course of this, the whole Modruš estate belonged to [[Stjepan III Frankopan Modruški|Stjepan III]] /Stephen III/ (born before 1416, died around 1481–84); in the sharing [[inheritance]] document it was written: „...to Stjepan belongs the market town Modruš with the Tržan ''Castrum''“...   It was a time of constant and steady rise, a „[[golden age]]“ of Modruš, that reached its peak in 1460, as the town became a seat of a [[bishop]].

[[Bernardin Frankopan]] (1453–1529), the only son of Stjepan III, successfully managed the whole of his property further from the Tržan Castle, although there was increasing threat of the Ottoman raids from the already conquered [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] territory, east of Modruš County. This led to decrease of importance of Tržan by the end of the 15th century, and the population of the whole area started to move away more and more from its old places of residence to the other, safer parts of Croatia and neighbouring countries, not willing to live in endangered territory.

In the first half of the 16th century the castle was always less [[wikt:maintenance|maintained]] and repaired than needed, and after 1553 came under control of the military authorities of the [[Croatian Military Frontier]]. A relatively small military deployment unit was permanently stationed there. After several unsuccessful attempts to renovate or rebuild the more and more severely damaged parts of the castle during the 17th and 18th century, the military authorities decided in 1791 to abandon it. Following the negligible Ottoman danger at that time, they presumed that it was not necessary to keep soldiers in Tržan and it was left to its own destiny, becoming a badly damaged castle [[ruin]] today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4007">{{hatnote|This article is about the dye produced from the turnsole plant, [[Chrozophora tinctoria]]. For other plants sometimes called turnsole, see [[Heliotropium]]}}
[[File:Hvalov zbornik1.jpg|thumb|250|Hvalov zbornik, 1404. Illustrated [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] manuscript from medieval [[Bosnia]]. Turnsole was an essential ingredient in some of the [[pigment]]s used in such illustrations]]
'''Turnsole''' or '''folium''' was a dyestuff prepared from the annual plant ''[[Chrozophora tinctoria]]''.

==History==
Turnsole became a mainstay of medieval [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminators]] starting with the development of the technique for extracting it in the thirteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson and Hamilton 1933:41&lt;/ref&gt; when it joined the vegetable-based [[woad]] and [[indigo]] in the illuminator's repertory. However, the queen of blue colorants was always the expensive [[lapis lazuli]] or its substitute [[azurite]], ground to the finest powders. According to its method of preparation, turnsole produced a range of translucent colors from blue, through purple to red, according to its reaction to the acidity or alkalinity of its environment, in the chemical reaction, not understood in the Middle Ages, that is most familiar in the [[Litmus test]].
[[File:ChrozophoraTinctoria.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''[[Chrozophora tinctoria]]'' fruit]]
''Folium'' ("leaf"), was actually derived from the three-lobed fruit (''illustration''), not the leaves. In the early fifteenth century, [[Cennino Cennini]], in his ''Libro dell' Arte'' gives a recipe "XVIII: How you should tint paper turnsole color" and "LXXVI To paint a purple or turnsole drapery in fresco." (though neither of these recipes use or describe turnsole). Textiles soaked in the dye vat would be left in a close damp cellar in an atmosphere produced by pans of [[urine]]. It was not realized that the oxidizing urine was producing [[ammonia]], but the technique reminds us how foul-smelling was the dyer's art.

The colorant was downgraded to a shading glaze and fell out of use in the illuminator's palette by the turn of the seventeenth century, with the easier availability of less fugitive mineral-derived blue pigments.

Turnsole was used as a food colorant, mentioned in ''Du Fait de Cuisine'' which suggests steeping it in milk. ''The French Cook'' by [[François Pierre La Varenne]] (London 1653) mentions turnsole grated in water with a little [[Orrisroot|powder of Iris]].  

[[Herbal]]s indicated that the plant grows on sunny, well-drained Mediterranean slopes and called it ''solsequium'' ("sun-follower") from its habit of turning its flowers to face the sun; alternatively it might be called "Greater Verucaria";&lt;ref&gt;So named in a recipe for producing the colorant,  ''Pro tornasolio faciendo'', [[British Library]], Sloane Mss 1754, folio 235 verso, quoted in Daniel V. Thompson, Jr., "Medieval Color-Making: Tractatus Qualiter Quilibet Artificialis Color Fieri Possit from Paris, B. N., MS. latin 6749", ''Isis'' '''22'''.2 (February 1935, pp. 456-468) p 458 note.&lt;/ref&gt; early botanical works gave it synonyms of  ''Morella'', ''Heliotropium tricoccum'' and ''Croton tinctorium''.

'''Viola''' is the [[protagonist]] of the play ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', written by [[William Shakespeare]].

==Role in the play==
Viola's actions produce all of the play's momentum. She is a young woman of Messaline. In the beginning Viola is found shipwrecked on the shores of [[Illyria]] and separated from her twin brother, not knowing whether he is alive or dead, the Sea Captain that tells her that this place is ruled by the Duke [[Orsino (Twelfth Night)|Orsino]], who is in love with the Countess Olivia. Viola wants to serve her, but, finding this impossible, she has the Sea Captain dress her up like a [[eunuch]], so she can serve the Duke instead.

Viola chooses the name Cesario and secures a position as a page working for the Duke. He then entrusts Cesario (Viola) to express his love for Olivia. Cesario continues to pass messages back and forth between the Duke and Olivia, but this eventually places her in somewhat of a quandary: she is forced by duty to do her best to plead Orsino’s case to Olivia, but an internal conflict of interest arises when she falls in love with Orsino, and Olivia, believing her to be male, falls in love with her. Upon receiving a ring from Olivia's steward, Viola contemplates the love triangle her disguise has created, admitting only time can solve it.

When Sebastian, Viola's lost twin, arrives alive and well in Illyria with a pirate named Antonio, the chaos of mistaken identity ensues because of their remarkably similar looks, only made more similar due to Viola dressing up as a male. The absurdity of the identity crisis builds until Sebastian and Viola as Cesario meet for the first time, and eventually recognise one another. Olivia and Sebastian have already been secretly married, as she mistook him for Cesario, and Sebastian, ignorant of the foregoing love triangle, was simply entranced by a beautiful woman. Ultimately then, given what he has witnessed, Orsino admits that he will no longer pursue Olivia, agreeing to love her as his sister, and decides to take Viola as his wife once she quits her disguise.

Although Viola is the play's protagonist, her true name is not spoken by any character—including herself—until the final scene of the play (Act 5, scene 1).

==Art and stage depictions==
Circa 1771 [[Francis Wheatley (painter)|Francis Wheatley]] used actress [[Elizabeth Younge]] as a model to paint Viola in Act III, Scene 4&lt;!-- Note: emory has "Act II" in error --&gt; after she and Sir Andrew have drawn swords (painting top-right).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Shakespeare Illustrated |url=http://shakespeare.emory.edu/illustrated_showimage.cfm?imageid=321 |publisher=[[Emory University]] |year=2003 |accessdate=12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Hamilton, A Scene from Twelfth Night.jpg|thumb|Viola (in orange, left) as Cesario; Olivia (in yellow, right). William Hamilton c. 1797]]
[[William Hamilton (painter)|William Hamilton]] painted the confrontation between Olivia and Viola circa 1797: in Act V, Scene 1 Olivia believes Viola (dressed as Cesario) to be Sebastian (Viola's twin brother) who she has just married.

It is currently headed by curator [[Wikipedia:WikiAfrica/Stubs/Meskerem Assegued|Meskerem Assegued]].

== History ==
The concept was first introduced to the public in 2002 during&amp;nbsp;Giziawi #1, its first art happening. Named after [[Zoma Shifferaw]], a young Ethiopian artist who died of cancer in 1979, ZCAC is located in two major cities in Ethiopia. ZCAC Addis is in a house built by [[Elias Sime]] in Addis Ababa, and ZCAC Harla is in Harla, a small historic village east of Dire Dawa. ZCAC is run like a family where the surrounding community is an extension of the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://zcac.weebly.com/zcac.html|title = Zoma Contemporary Art Center|date = |accessdate = |website = Zoma Contemporary Art Center|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==

=== ZCAC Addis Ababa ===
[[file:ZCAC Addis Compound.jpeg|thumb|ZCAC Addis Ababa Compound]]

The construction of ZCAC begun in 2002 by Elias Sime, which  took him about seven years to build the unique building of mud and straw. Due to Elias' solo exhibition “Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart” (2009) at the [[Santa Monica Museum of Art]], the house attracted the attention of the world media.&amp;nbsp;The New York Times Magazine&amp;nbsp;called it “a voluptuous dream, a swirl of ancient technique and ecstatic imagination”. The house is the home of ZCAC Addis and features a showroom and a studio for visiting artists. In 2014, the New York Times selected ZCAC's photo for their article about&amp;nbsp;52 places to go in 2014.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/10/travel/2014-places-to-go.html?_r=1|title = 52 Places to go in 2014|date = |accessdate = |website = New York Times|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== ZCAC Harla DireDawa ===
Harla is a small village located in hills roughly 15 kilometers from Dire Dawa encompassing  several archaeological sites. In 2007, ZCAC received a piece of land in Harla from the Dire Dawa city administration. Following ZCAC's goals, sustainable buildings are being constructed there.

== Zoma School ==
Zoma School is an edible schoolyard where students learn to create and sustain an organic garden in a landscape that is wholly integrated into the schools’ curriculum, culture and food program. 

Inspired by [[Alice Waters]] [[Edible Schoolyard]] project, Zoma School aims to provide an education system where children are thought mathematics, science, language and art by integrated garden and kitchen classes. 

One of the activities taught to kids at the school is how to [[unicycle]]. The founders believe that children will build a lifetime of confidence through the trail and error that it takes to learn how to unicycle and with out much help from adults.
