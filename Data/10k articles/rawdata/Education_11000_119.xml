'''Advanced Placement (AP) Physics 2''', along with [[AP Physics 1]], is a year-long [[Advanced Placement|AP]] course designed by the [[College Board]] to replace [[AP Physics B]] in the 2014 - 2015 school year. The courses will teach the same general curriculum as [[AP Physics B]], but instead splitting the course into two and covering more information, specifically [[Rotation around a fixed axis|rotational mechanics]].  The courses were formed through collaboration between current Advanced Placement teachers and The College Board, with the guidance of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] and the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/math-and-science/physics AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 | Advances in AP&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to [[AP Physics C]] the course is said to cover the material of a second [[semester]] [[university]] [[undergraduate]] [[physics]] course offered at a typical American university,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jacobsphysics.blogspot.com/2011/07/ap-physics-1-and-2-redesign-as-it.html Jacobs Physics: AP Physics 1 and 2 Redesign (as it stands now) and Honors Physics I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but with an algebra based curriculum as opposed to [[AP Physics C]] calculus based curriculum.

==History==
The first AP Physics 2 classes began in the fall of the 2014-2015 school year, with the first AP exams administered in May 2015. As of August 2013 AP summer institutes, the College Board [[professional development]] course for Advanced Placement and [[Pre-Advanced Placement Program|Pre-AP]] teachers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://professionals.collegeboard.com/prof-dev/workshops/summer-institutes AP and Pre-AP Summer Institutes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; will dedicate 20% of the total to preparing AP Physics B educators for the new AP physics course. Face to face workshops sponsored by the College Board will begin to focus 20% their content on the new course as soon as September 2013. In February 2014 the official course description and sample curriculum resources will be posted to the College Board website, with 2 practice exams being posted the next month. As of September 2014 face to face workshops will be dedicated solely to AP Physics 1 &amp; AP Physics 2. The full course will be taught starting in 2014, and the exam will be given 2015.

==Curriculum==
AP Physics 2 is an algebra-based, introductory college-level physics course that explores topics such as fluid statics and dynamics; thermodynamics with kinetic theory; PV diagrams and probability; electrostatics; electrical circuits with capacitors; magnetic fields; electromagnetism; physical and geometric optics; and quantum, atomic, and nuclear physics. Through inquiry-based learning, students will develop scientific critical thinking and reasoning skills.

The College Board has released a "Curriculum Framework" which includes the 7 principles on which the new AP Physics courses will be based as well as smaller "Enduring Understanding" concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap_physics2_2page_course_overview.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''academic library''' is a [[library]]  that is attached to a higher education institution which serves two complementary purposes 
to support the school's curriculum, and to support the research of the university faculty and students.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curzon|first=Susan|author2=Jennie Quinonez-Skinner|title=Academic Libraries|journal=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences|date=9 September 2009|doi=10.1081/E-ELIS3-120044525|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1081/E-ELIS3-120044390|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown how many academic libraries there are internationally. An academic and research portal maintained by [[UNESCO]] links to 3,785 libraries. According to the [[National Center for Education Statistics]], there are an estimated 3,700 academic libraries in the United States.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science" /&gt; 
The support of teaching and learning requires material for class readings and for student papers. In the past, the material for class readings, intended to supplement lectures as prescribed by the instructor, has been called reserves. In the period before electronic resources became available, the reserves were supplied as actual books or as photocopies of appropriate journal articles.

Academic libraries must determine a focus for collection development since comprehensive collections are not feasible. Librarians do this by identifying the needs of the faculty and student body, as well as the mission and academic programs of the college or university. When there are particular areas of specialization in academic libraries, these are often referred to as [[niche collections]]. These collections are often the basis of a [[Special collections|special collection]] department and may include original papers, artwork, and artifacts written or created by a single author or about a specific subject.

There is a great deal of variation among academic libraries based on their size, resources, collections, and services. The [[Harvard Library|Harvard University Library]] is considered to be the largest strict academic library in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pezzi |first=Bryan |title=Massachusetts |publisher=Weigl Publishers |year=2000 |page=15 |isbn=1-930954-35-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Danish Royal Library]]—a combined [[National library|national]] and academic library—has a larger collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2015|url=http://www.kb.dk/export/sites/kb_dk/da/kb/aarsberetning/aarsberetninger/2015.pdf|title=Årsberetning 2015|accessdate=2017-08-28|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable example is the [[University of the South Pacific]] which has academic libraries distributed throughout its twelve member countries.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science" /&gt; The [[University of California]] operates the largest academic library system in the world, it manages more than 34 million items in 100 libraries on ten campuses. 

==History==
{{globalize|date=August 2017}}
===United States===
{{see also|University libraries in the United States}}
The first colleges in the United States were intended to train members of the clergy. The libraries associated with these institutions largely consisted of donated books on the subjects of theology and the classics. In 1766, [[Yale University|Yale]] had approximately 4,000 volumes, second only to [[Harvard University|Harvard]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | last=Budd | first = John M.| title = The Academic Library: Its Context, Its Purpose, and Its Operation| publisher = Libraries Unlimited| year = 1998| location = Englewood, Colorado| pages = 30–31| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to these libraries was restricted to faculty members and a few students: the only staff was a part-time faculty member or the president of the college.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book| last = McCabe | first = Gerard|author2= Ruth J. Person| title = Academic Libraries: Their Rationale and Role in American Higher Education | publisher = Greenwood Press| year = 1995| location = Westport, Connecticut| pages = 1–3| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The priority of the library was to protect the books, not to allow patrons to use them. In 1849, [[Yale University|Yale]] was open 30 hours a week, the [[University of Virginia]] was open nine hours a week, [[Columbia University]] four, and [[Bowdoin College]] only three.&lt;ref name="Budd 1998, p. 34"&gt;Budd (1998), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Students instead created [[Literary society|literary societies]] and assessed entrance fees in order to build a small collection of usable volumes often in excess of what the university library held.&lt;ref name="Budd 1998, p. 34"/&gt;

Around the turn of the century, this approach began to change. The  [[American Library Association]] was formed in 1876, with members including [[Melvil Dewey]] and [[Charles Ammi Cutter]]. Libraries re-prioritized in favor of improving access to materials, and found funding increasing as a result of increased demand for said materials.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe (1995), pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic libraries today vary in regard to the extent to which they accommodate those who are not affiliated with their parent universities.   Some offer reading and borrowing privileges to members of the public on payment of an annual fee; such fees can vary greatly. The privileges so obtained usually do not extend to  such services as computer usage, other than to search the catalog, or Internet access. Alumni and students of cooperating local universities may be given discounts or other consideration when arranging for borrowing privileges. On the other hand, access to the libraries of some universities is absolutely restricted to students, faculty, and staff. Even in this case, they may make it possible for others to borrow materials through inter-library loan programs.

Libraries of land-grant universities generally are more accessible to the public. In some cases, they are official government document repositories and so are required to be open to the public. Still, members of the public are generally charged fees for borrowing privileges, and usually are not allowed to access everything they would be able to as students.

===Canada===
Academic libraries in Canada are a relatively recent development in relation to other countries. The very first academic library in Canada was opened in 1789 in Windsor, Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name="Beckman, M. 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Libraries|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0004674|author=Beckman, M.|author2=Dahms, M.|author3=Lorne, B.|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Academic libraries were significantly small during the 19th century and up until the 1950s, when Canadian academic libraries began to grow steadily as a result of greater importance being placed on education and research.&lt;ref name="Beckman, M. 2010"/&gt; The growth of libraries throughout the 1960s was a direct result of many overwhelming factors including inflated student enrollments, increased graduate programs, higher budget allowance, and general advocacy of the importance of these libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Downs|first=R. B.|title=Resources of canadian academic and research libraries|year=1967|publisher=Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada|location=Ottawa, ON.|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this growth and the Ontario New Universities Library Project that occurred during the early 1960s, 5 new universities were established in Ontario that all included fully catalogued collections.&lt;ref name="Beckman, M. 2010"/&gt; The establishment of libraries was widespread throughout Canada and was furthered by grants provided by the Canada Council and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, which sought to enhance library collections.&lt;ref name="Beckman, M. 2010"/&gt;  Since many academic libraries were constructed after World War Two, a majority of the Canadian academic libraries that were built before 1940 that have not been updated to modern lighting, air conditioning, etc., are either no longer in use or are on the verge of decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Downs|first=R. B.|title=Resources of canadian academic and research libraries|year=1967|publisher=Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada|location=Ottawa, ON.|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The total number of college and university libraries increased from 31 in 1959-1960 to 105 in 1969-1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Downs|first=R. B.|title=Resources of canadian academic and research libraries|year=1967|publisher=Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada|location=Ottawa, ON.|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the growth of academic libraries in Canada during the 1960s, there was a brief period of sedation, which was a primary result of some major budgetary issues.&lt;ref name="The Canada Council"&gt;{{cite book|title=University research libraries: Report of the consultative group on university research libraries|year=1978|publisher=The Canada Council|location=Ottawa, ON|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These academic libraries were faced with cost issues relating to the recently developed service of interlibrary lending and the high costs of periodicals on acquisition budgets, which affected overall acquisition budgeting and ultimately general collections.&lt;ref name="The Canada Council"/&gt; Canadian academic libraries faced consistent problems relating to insufficient collections and overall lack of coordination among collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=University research libraries: Report of the consultative group on university research libraries|year=1978|publisher=The Canada Council|location=Ottawa, ON|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic libraries within Canada would not have flourished and continue to be strengthened without the help of outside organizations. The Ontario Council of University Libraries (OCUL) was established in 1967 and is concerned with promoting unity among Canadian academic libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocul.on.ca/node/25|title=A History of Collaboration|first=|date=|year=2011|website=Ontario Council of University Libraries|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826054848/http://www.ocul.on.ca/node/25|archive-date=2012-08-26|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-02-17|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ontario College and University Library Association (OCULA) is attached to the Ontario Library Association (OLA) and is concerned with representing academic librarians in regards to issues that are shared in the academic library setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About OCULA |url=http://www.accessola.org/ola_prod/OLAWEB/OCULA/About_OCULA/OLAWEB/OCULA/About_OCULA.aspx |author=Ontario Library Association |year=n.d. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206012959/http://www.accessola.org/ola_prod/OLAWEB/OCULA/About_OCULA/OLAWEB/OCULA/About_OCULA.aspx |archivedate=6 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Bogoliubov Prize for young scientists''' is an award offered to young researchers in [[theoretical physics]] by the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR), an international intergovernmental organization located in Dubna, Russia. The award is issued in memory of the physicist and mathematician [[Nikolay Bogoliubov]]. 

The prize is awarded to young (up to 33-year-old) researchers for "outstanding contributions in fields of [[theoretical physics]] related to Bogoliubov's scientific interests".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/main/article/39/3/19 Bogoliubov prize for young scientists] at CERN COURIER&lt;/ref&gt; The awardee is one who has demonstrated "early scientific maturity" and whose results are recognized worldwide and peer-reviewed. The laureates generally emulate Bogoliubov's own skill in using sophisticated mathematics to attempt to solve concrete physical problems (mostly in the fields of [[nonlinear dynamics]], [[statistical physics]], [[quantum field theory]] and elementary [[particle physics]]).

==Jury==
The jury is presided by the theoretical physicist [[Dmitry Shirkov]], who co-authored many works with Nikolay Bogoliubov.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5424">The '''Rudolf Carnap Papers''' are a large collection of documents and photographs that record much of his life and career. They are used by scholars and historians not only for research into the life of [[Rudolf Carnap]] but also for research into his theories and the theories of other scholars with whom he corresponded. The Carnap papers are restored, maintained, cataloged and housed in the [[Archives Service Center, University Library System, University of Pittsburgh]]. They include extensive correspondence with others, lecture outlines for courses that he taught, and drafts of his published works and unpublished manuscripts. Much of the content of the Rudolf Carnap papers is available electronically and searchable through the finding aid through the [[Archives Service Center, University Library System, University of Pittsburgh|archives]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web

Originally an outgrowth of [[Damon Knight]] and [[Kate Wilhelm]]'s [[Milford Writer's Workshop|Milford Writers' Conference]], held at their home in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], United States, it was founded in 1968 by [[Robin Wilson (author)|Robin Scott Wilson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Anders|title=Project Triton: New Sci-Fi Colony|url=http://ucsdmag.ucsd.edu/magazine/vol5no2/features/projecttriton.htm|website=UCSD Alumni|publisher=UCSanDiego|accessdate=6 September 2015|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Clarion University of Pennsylvania|Clarion State College]] in [[Pennsylvania]].

== Other Clarion Workshops ==
Independently-operated workshops which share the Clarion name and follow its founding principles include:
* [[Clarion West Writers Workshop]], founded in Seattle, Washington in 1971 by [[Vonda N. McIntyre]]. It has been held annually since 1984.
* Clarion South Writers Workshop was held at [[Griffith University]] in Brisbane, Australia. It was founded in 2004 and ran biennially. In 2009, Clarion South lost its venue, although the workshop was held that year. In March 2011, Clarion South organizers announced that future workshops were "on hold indefinitely."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.clarionsouth.org/|title = Workshop Update|date = March 2011|accessdate = |website = Clarion South|publisher = |last = |first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130328142743/http://www.clarionsouth.org/|archivedate = March 28, 2013|dead-url = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CyArk''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization located in [[Oakland, California]], United States. The organization's website refers to it as a "digital archive of the world's heritage sites for preservation and education". Its official mission statement is "Digitally preserving cultural heritage sites through collecting, archiving and providing open access to data created by [[laser scanning]], [[3D modeling|digital modeling]], and other state-of-the-art technologies."

CyArk's founder, [[Ben Kacyra]], stated during his speech at the 2011 [[TED Conference]] that the organization was created in response to increasing human and natural threats to heritage sites, and to ensure the "collective human memory" is not lost while making it available through modern dissemination tools like the internet and mobile platforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/ben_kacyra_ancient_wonders_captured_in_3d.html Video of Ben Kacyra's speech at the TED 2011 conference]&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is known for its work with a number of partners in producing high-quality digital scanning of [[World Heritage Sites]], such as [[Angkor Wat]], [[Pompeii]], [[Chichen Itza]], the [[Eastern Qing tombs]], [[Nineveh]], the [[Antonine Wall]], [[Mount Rushmore]], and many others.&lt;ref name = "jbrown"&gt;{{Cite news

==History==
[[Image:Cyark Tikal Temple II.jpg|thumb|right|Profile of [[Tikal Temple II]]]]
CyArk was founded in 2003 by [[Iraqi American|Iraqi expatriate]] and [[civil engineer]] Ben Kacyra. In the 1990s, Kacyra was instrumental in the invention and marketing of the first truly portable [[3D Scanner|laser scanner]]. The scanner, called the [[Cyrax (HDS system)|Cyrax]], was designed for surveying purposes, and was produced by Cyra Technologies.&lt;ref name = "abate"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Cyra Technologies and all rights to the invention were sold to the Swiss firm [[Leica Geosystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After sale of the company, Ben Kacyra dedicated his energy to using the new technology to document archaeological and cultural heritage resources, and to the CyArk organization.&lt;ref name = "eapowell"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CyArk's primary focus has been the documentation and digital preservation of threatened ancient and historical architecture. This architecture includes sites such as Colorado's [[Mesa Verde]], Italy's [[Pompeii]], Wyoming's [[Fort Laramie]], and Kacyra's native [[Mosul]] in Iraq – also known as the biblical [[Assyria]]n city of [[Nineveh]].

CyArk has generated a fairly large amount of publicity since its inception. Initially, this was in part due to the relevance of Kacyra's life story to the ongoing [[Iraq War]], during which much of the country's cultural patrimony was destroyed amidst a [[Archaeological looting in Iraq|spasm of looting]] and heavy military damage to important historical sites such as [[Babylon]] and [[Samarra]]. As the public face of the CyArk organization, Ben Kacyra became a popular speaker at conferences such as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD7XUwxAuEw Google’s Zeitgeist (2008)],  and [http://www.ted.com/talks/ben_kacyra_ancient_wonders_captured_in_3d.html TEDGlobal (2011)], describing his life story and the potential of digital preservation to save the "collective treasure" of global heritage. In recent years, however, he has taken on more of an advisory role, while the independent non-profit organization CyArk has gathered considerable momentum.

"In October of 2013, CyArk launched the CyArk 500 Challenge."&lt;ref name = "cheves" /&gt; The organization announced that it seeks to "digitally preserve 500 heritage sites in five years."&lt;ref name = "cyark2014"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, CyArk has become a major entity in the historic preservationist and cultural resource/heritage management communities. The 2014 CyArk 500 Annual Summit was held at the [[National Archives Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The theme was "Democratising cultural  heritage: Enabling access to information, technology and  support."&lt;ref name = "cyark2014" /&gt;

According to CyArk's mission statement, the organization is 

{{quote|dedicated to the preservation of cultural heritage sites through the CyArk 3D Heritage Archive, an internet archive which is the repository for heritage site data developed through laser scanning, digital modeling, and other state-of-the-art spatial technologies.}} 

CyArk's digital data may be useful for professionals monitoring and managing gradual architectural deterioration at cultural sites.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Ben Kacyra in National Geographic (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This data could also make it possible to generate blueprints for reconstruction following catastrophic events, such as the [[Afghan Taliban]]'s notorious demolition of the [[Bamiyan Buddhas]] in 2001 or the 2010 destruction by suspected arson of the [[Kasubi Tombs|Royal Tombs of Kasubi]], [[Uganda]]. The Kasubi Tombs were digitally preserved by CyArk a year before their demise, providing a lasting digital record and potential blueprint for reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CyArk offers a publicly accessible web archive for the archaeological sites it has studied. The archive includes a short film introduction for each site, a slideshow of site history, and information about the digital preservation process used. A site plan displays geo-located multimedia, which is also accessible in an image gallery, along with three-dimensional images of site details such as rooms and profiles, and computer-generated reconstructions. The three dimensional images are often taken from a "[[point cloud]]" image showing the raw scan data.&lt;ref name = "pbswiredscience"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/story/91-laser_archaeology.html PBS' ''Wired Science'' segment on CyArk], November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; CyArk has granted permission for reuse of some of the images through a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution/Share-Alike license.

According to CyArk's online mission statement, the dissemination of free digital content about heritage sites can help encourage additional visits by tourists, and invigorate communities with revenue from [[cultural tourism]]. Youth and educators will benefit from free, publicly accessible historical and site information, including some Creative Commons-licensed content. And finally, the creation of digital records ensures not only that the sites will never be lost forever; it also provides a digital resource to facilitate the continued mining of information over time as technologies and methods of information extraction evolve.

The CyArk website also offers a world map of the hazards which global heritage sites face, such as earthquakes and [[Current sea level rise|sea level rise]] due to [[global warming]].

== Funding and partnerships ==
Initially, CyArk was fully supported by the Kacyra family and their Kacyra Family Foundation.&lt;ref name = "abate"/&gt;

CyArk is now primarily funded through individual project funding, corporate in-kind support, and foundation grants/donations. Corporate funders as of 2014 include [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], [[Iron Mountain Incorporated|Iron Mountain]], [[Autodesk]], and [[Trimble Navigation]].&lt;ref name = "cheves" /&gt;

CyArk has also established working relationships with project partners in engineering, media, and academia, including Christofori und Partner and [[PBS]]. At [[UC Berkeley]], the organization coordinated an internship program with the department of Anthropology in 2006-2007. CyArk is currently an approved work-study employer for Cal students.

As of October 2011, the already-existing partnerships with the United States' [[National Park Service]] (NPS), the United Kingdom's [[Historic Scotland]] (HS), [[World Monuments Fund]], and Mexico's [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|Instituto Nacional de Antropología]] y Historia ([[INAH]]) had been greatly expanded,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.cyark.org/community Updates from CyArk, 2011], CyArk website&lt;/ref&gt; with upcoming projects that include Mexico's Teotihuacan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.cyark.org/teotihuacan-and-the-pyramid-of-quetzalcoatl-blog Teotihuacan], CyArk website&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland's [[Rosslyn Chapel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.cyark.org/cyark-to-host-data-from-rosslyn-chapel-blog Rosslyn Chapel], CyArk website&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq's [[Babylon]], and the U.S.' [[Mount Rushmore|Mount Rushmore National Memorial]].&lt;ref name = "elee" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.cyark.org/managing-a-digital-mount-rushmore-blog Mount Rushmore], CyArk website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSACJG Entrance.JPG|thumbnail|right|One of the most renown institute in the whole GB Region [[Public Schools and Colleges Jutial Gilgit]]]]
'''Gilgit-Baltistan''' Balawaristan (GB) is an area which affiliated with [[Pakistan]] in 1948. There was no educational system at the time. Gradually some of the more ambitions students of GB moved toward different cities (such as [[Karachi]] and [[Lahore]]) in search of a better education. Some of them returned to their home after completion of their education, and started teaching their children, thus making people aware of what it was to be literate. They demanded the government build schools in the region, but their demand was neglected because the region didn't have a representative in the senate or [[National Assembly (Pakistan)]].
After several years, schools were opened in Gilgit-Baltistan and thus its educational system came into being.

==Beginnings==
At first, only primary and middle-schools were available. Gradually, these middle-schools were upgraded to high-schools. In the 1970s, students had to migrate in order to attend university. The revolution in education began when private schools began to emerge under the Jabir Bin Hayyan trust initiative. Then after a sudden several private schools began to emerge. According to one news report the private sector contributes 90% of the infrastructure for the overall education in Gilgit Baltistan. The Aga Khan foundation was also the other NGO which contributed to the spread of education.

==Actuality==
During the last decade the first higher education institutions were constructed. The first university, [[Karakoram University]], was founded during the reign of Pervez Musharaf. The university was established in 2002 by a charter from the federal government on the orders of [[Pervez Musharraf]], President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Another campus of this university was established in Skardu Hussain Abad in 2010, though it currently faces financial strains.

There are eighteen colleges in GB, including eight girls' colleges and ten boys' colleges. Ten of them are in the Gilgit district and seven are in the [[Skardu District]]. Seven are degree colleges, eight are intermediate{{clarify|date=August 2012}} and other two are elementary colleges.

==Statistics==
According to a [[World Bank]] Economic Report On Gilgit-Baltistan (2010–11), the net primary school enrolment in Gilgit Baltistan is 51%, the net middle-school enrollment is 17%, and only 14% are enrolled in matric school.{{clarify|date=August 2012}} In other words, only 17 out of every 100 students achieve the middle level and only 14 out of every 100 students reach to matric level.

According to a current survey,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} approximately a thousand students belonging to Baltistan are studying in different colleges and universities of Karachi. There are no medical or engineering colleges in the area. A large number of students are studying in different colleges and schools of Pakistan. However, seats for Gilgit-Baltistan are very limited in engineering and medical colleges.
There are no scholarship programs for higher education in GB. Medical colleges in Karachi do not provide a single seat for students coming from Gilgit-Baltistan. On September 29, 2009 Prime Minister Gillani announced the foundation of the first medical college. However, construction hasn't begun. Currently, the local government has allocated an amount of over Rs361 million (5.3% of the total budget) towards education in the area.

'''Eisenhower Fellowships''' is a private, non-profit, non-partisan organization created in 1953 by a group of prominent American citizens to honor President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] for his contribution to humanity as a soldier, statesman, and world leader.  The organization identifies, empowers and connects innovative leaders through a transformative fellowship experience and lifelong engagement in a global network of dynamic change agents committed to creating a world more peaceful, prosperous and just.

Each Fellow receives an individualized five to seven week program of consultations with experts and senior officials in government, industry, academia, the arts and the not-for profit sector. The Global Program brings 20 – 25 Fellows from countries around the world in all sectors to the U.S. each spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://efworld.org/our-programs/international |title=International program|publisher=Efworld.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each fall a Single Nation, Single Region or Common Interest Program brings to the U.S. a similar number of Fellows. The USA Program sends 8 – 10 Americans abroad, including at least one U.S. farmer or rancher, to gain international exposure to people, institutions, technologies and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://efworld.org/our-programs/usa |title=USA Program|publisher=Efworld.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2015, the Zhi-Xing China Eisenhower Fellowship is awarded to ten candidates, who travel as a group exclusively to China.

Fellows are identified by committees in 48 countries and six U.S. locales (New England, Philadelphia, Research Triangle-NC, St. Louis, Chicago and Los Angeles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efworld.org/programs/eisenhower_fellowships_prospective_usa_fellowships.php |title=Eisenhower Fellowships |publisher=Efworld.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315175133/http://www.efworld.org/programs/eisenhower_fellowships_prospective_usa_fellowships.php |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They identify men and women who have demonstrated significant achievement and are poised to assume positions of substantial influence in their fields. Eisenhower Fellows regularly attain higher positions after they have been awarded the fellowship.&lt;ref name="efworld1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efworld.org/alumni/eisenhower_fellowships_about_the_network.php |title=Eisenhower Fellowships |publisher=Efworld.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315175138/http://www.efworld.org/alumni/eisenhower_fellowships_about_the_network.php |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than half of all Eisenhower Fellowships alumni indicate that they have been involved in fostering societal change at some point after their fellowship.

Since the organization’s founding, nearly 2,000 men and women have been awarded fellowships, forming a global network of leaders. Fellows are located in over 100 countries, including heads of government, cabinet-level officials, national legislators, provincial governors, university presidents, and CEOs of corporations and non-profit organizations who engage with other Fellows and with other members of the Eisenhower network.&lt;ref name="efworld1"/&gt;

==History==
In 1953, [[Thomas Bayard McCabe]] led a group of Pennsylvania businessmen in the establishment of Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships to commemorate President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s first birthday in the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.efworld.org/about/eisenhower_fellowships_history.php |title=Eisenhower Fellowships 1 |publisher=Efworld.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202040317/http://www.efworld.org/about/eisenhower_fellowships_history.php |archivedate=2012-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower Fellowships was different from existing fellowship and exchange programs in all parts of the world because Fellows were chosen by nominating committees and awarded to mid-career professionals from all sectors of society, not just academia. Fellows have come from a number of diverse fields which vary year-to-year as the nominating committees respond to the current international needs. The programs were designed to allow the fellows an individual experience in which they travel to another country and interact with professional peers to expand their worldviews and gain cultural experiences as well as interact with other Fellows.

===1950s===
Sixteen fellowships were awarded in 1954 to three Americans and thirteen men from overseas. Initially, all funds came from the fundraising efforts of the EF Board of Trustees,&lt;ref name="Eisenhower Fellowships"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://efworld.org/about-us/trustees |title=Eisenhower Fellowships |publisher=Efworld.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a ten-year $600,000 grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] in 1956 massively contributed to the prestige and abilities of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordfoundation.org/grants/ |title=Grants / Ford Foundation |publisher=Fordfoundation.org |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decade, the size of yearly Fellow cohorts grew each year and from 1954 to 1964, the number of participating countries more than doubled.

===1960s===
As had been suggested by the first Fellows, each year’s program included at least two seminars where Fellows met and shared experiences. Yearly newsletters and three international alumni conferences strengthened the bonds among old friends and created new linkages. A second Ford Foundation grant in 1967 encouraged EF to experiment with larger programs. In 1961 the first Eisenhower regional conference was held in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], and in the same year, the first female Fellow, Dr. Pilar G. Villegas, was named.&lt;ref name="Eisenhower Fellowships"/&gt; In 1963, the USA Fellow program was suspended temporarily.

===1970s===
As the U.S. celebrated its [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial]] in 1976, one hundred and one Fellows from fifty six countries convened in San Francisco for EF’s First World Forum. The strength of the international alumni presence inspired the EF Trustees to name five international Fellows to the board. In 1977, President [[Gerald Ford]] was appointed president.

===1980s===
President [[Gerald Ford]] and John Eisenhower responded to fundraising challenges by helping to get a grant from the [[U.S. Congress]] for $7.5 million. The grant allowed EEF to expand its programs and reach. In 1986, the first Single Nation Program was introduced under the leadership of Theodore Friend, EEF President. Prior to 1986, Multi-Nation Programs had only allowed one fellowship to be granted to each participating country. The Single Nation Program allowed a closer focus and was launched in 1986 with six Eisenhower Fellows from the Philippines. In 1988, the first Dwight D. Eisenhower Medal for Leadership and Service was awarded to Ambassadors [[Walter Annenberg]] and [[Thomas J. Watson, Jr.]] In 1989, the USA Fellow Program returned after a 26-year hiatus, which brought EEF to three yearly programs (the Multi-Nation Program, the Single Nation Program, and the USA Fellow Program) with fifty Fellows participating.

===1990s===
EEF celebrated the centennial of President Eisenhower’s birth in 1990 at its second World Forum called “From Fellowship to Partnership” in Philadelphia. This time, over two hundred Fellows from 63 countries gathered. The enthusiastic response motivated the Turkish Fellows to hold a reunion conference in [[Turkey]] the following year. In the next eighteen years, eleven other countries hosted EF conferences. In 1991, legislation sponsored by Senator [[Bob Dole]] and Representative [[Pat Roberts]] established a permanent endowment for EEF in honor of President Eisenhower.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, V. 150, Pt. 11, June 25, 2004 to July 14, 2004 By Congress&lt;/ref&gt;
Single Area Programs in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] and Fellows from [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] in the early 90s demonstrated EF’s response to changing political conditions and support for emerging [[democracies]]. A Single Nation Program in [[South Africa]] for nine Fellows was run in 1994 after the country elected its first truly democratic government.

===2000s===
In its sixth decade, Eisenhower Fellowships developed additional programs and foci. In 2003, EF celebrated its 50th Multi Nation Program and 50th Anniversary Conference in Philadelphia called “Connecting Global Leaders.”&lt;ref&gt;Perrone, Marguerite. "Eisenhower Fellowship: A History 1953-2003". 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; USA Fellows started choosing their fellowship destination(s) from a list of 27 countries on six continents. The Multi-Nation and Single-Nation programs continued, but the addition of Regional Programs, three in Asia, and one each in Latin America and the Middle East, were implemented to develop stronger international ties between countries in similar areas. In 2007 and 2009, two Common Interest Programs were introduced with Fellows from the United States and from overseas participating. In 2010, Eisenhower Fellowships held its first Women's Leadership Program, designed to help create a more consequential and sustainable world in all sectors through the equitable involvement of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://efworld.org/news/head-of-un-women-on-next-steps-to-deliver-empowerment#.Vurm18vbKUl |title=Eisenhower Fellowships |publisher=Efworld.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Distinguished Alumnus Award==
In 2008, EF established the Distinguished Alumnus Award to recognize an alumnus or alumna who has demonstrated a significant contribution to his or her field of endeavor, and leadership in the Eisenhower Fellowships alumni network.&lt;ref name="efworld1"/&gt;  The recipient’s post-fellowship activities must reflect President Eisenhower’s commitment to peace and productivity by working through direct personal contacts across boundaries. Open to anyone who has completed an Eisenhower Fellowship since the program was founded in 1953, it is presented at the Annual Meeting of the Board of Trustees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17487">A '''financial endowment''' is a donation of [[money]] or [[property]] to a [[nonprofit organization]] which uses the resulting investment income for a specific purpose. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endowment.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the endowment is structured so that the [[principal (finance)|principal]] amount is kept intact, while the investment income is available for use, or part of the principal is released each year, which allows for their [[donation]] to have an impact over a longer period than if it were spent all at once. An endowment may come with stipulations regarding its usage.

The total value of an institution's [[investment]]s is often referred to as the institution's endowment and is typically organized as a [[public charity]], [[private foundation]], or [[trust (law)|trust]]. Among the institutions that commonly manage endowments are academic institutions (e.g., [[college]]s, [[universities]], and [[private school]]s), cultural institutions (e.g., museums, libraries, and theaters), service organizations (e.g., hospitals, retirement homes, the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|SPCA]]), and religious organizations (e.g., churches, synagogues, mosques).

==History==
The earliest "endowed chairs" were those established by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[emperor]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] in [[Athens]] in AD&amp;nbsp;176. Aurelius created one endowed chair for each of the major schools of philosophy: [[Platonism]], [[Aristotelianism]], [[Stoicism]], and [[Epicureanism]]. Later, similar endowments were set up in some other major cities of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frede|first=Dorothea|title=Alexander of Aphrodisias &gt; 1.1 Date, Family, Teachers, and Influence|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alexander-aphrodisias/#1.1|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=6 September 2012|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynch|first=John Patrick|title=Aristotle's school; a study of a Greek educational institution|year=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520021945|pages=19––207; 213–216|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaYV57QiQDYC&amp;vq=spoof&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was adapted to the modern university system beginning in England in 1502, when [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]], Countess of Richmond and grandmother to the future king [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]], created the first endowed chairs in divinity at the universities of Oxford ([[Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity (Oxford)|Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity]]) and Cambridge ([[Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity]]).&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2004110501 Lady Margaret's 500&amp;#8209;year legacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516043532/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2004110501 |date=2007-05-16 }} – University of Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 50&amp;nbsp;years later, Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII established the [[Regius Professorships]] at both universities, this time in five subjects: divinity, civil law, Hebrew, Greek, and physic—the last of those corresponding to what are now known as medicine and basic sciences. Today, the [[University of Glasgow]] has fifteen Regius Professorships.

Private individuals soon adopted the practice of endowing professorships. [[Isaac Newton]] held the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian Chair of Mathematics]] at Cambridge beginning in 1669, more recently held by the celebrated physicist [[Stephen Hawking]].&lt;ref name="Bruen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruen|first=Robert|title=A Brief History of The Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics at Cambridge University|url=http://www.lucasianchair.org/|publisher=Robert Bruen|accessdate=6 September 2012|date=May 1995|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824222550/http://www.lucasianchair.org/|archivedate=24 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
*Unrestricted endowment can be used in any way the recipient chooses to carry out its mission.
*Term endowment funds stipulate that all or part of the principal may be expended only after the expiration of a stated period of time or occurrence of a specified event, depending on donor wishes.
*Quasi endowment funds must retain the purpose and intent as specified by the donor or source of the original funds and earnings may be expended only for the specified purpose.

===Restricted endowments===
Endowment revenue can be restricted by donors to serve many purposes. Endowed professorships or scholarships restricted to a particular subject are common; in some places a donor could fund a trust exclusively for the support of a pet.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Forbes_March_5_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/01/13/pet-trusts-will-helmsley-personal-finance-protect-your-pet.html |title=Caring For Fido After You're Gone |newspaper=Forbes |date=January 13, 2010 |author=Ashlea Ebelling |accessdate=March 5, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402145722/http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/13/pet-trusts-will-helmsley-personal-finance-protect-your-pet.html |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_The_Wall_Street_Journal_March_5_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2015/02/19/monkey-to-inherit-house-garden-trust-fund/ |title=Monkey to Inherit House, Garden, Trust Fund – India Real Time |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=February 19, 2015 |author=Dhanya Ann Thoppil |accessdate=March 5, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222124527/http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2015/02/19/monkey-to-inherit-house-garden-trust-fund/ |archivedate=February 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring the restriction is called "[[Endowment invasion|invading]]" the endowment.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Thenonprofittimes.com_March_5_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/bankrupt-but-endowed/ |title=Bankrupt But Endowed – The NonProfit TimesThe NonProfit Times |newspaper=Thenonprofittimes.com |date=June 12, 2012 |author=Patrick Sullivan |accessdate=March 5, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402161542/http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/bankrupt-but-endowed/ |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But change of circumstance or financial duress like bankruptcy can preclude carrying out the donor's intent.  A court can alter the use of restricted endowment under a doctrine called [[Cy-près doctrine|cy-près]] meaning to find an alternative "as near as possible" to the donor's intent.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Thenonprofittimes.com_March_5_2015c"/&gt;  The restricted/unrestricted distinction focuses on the use of the funds; see quasi-endowment below for a distinction about whether principal can be spent.

==College and university endowments==
{{See also|Lists of institutions of higher education by endowment}}
Academic institutions, such as colleges and universities, will frequently control an endowment fund that finances a portion of the operating or capital requirements of the institution. In addition to a general endowment fund, each university may also control a number of restricted endowments that are intended to fund specific areas within the institution. The most common examples are endowed professorships (also known as named chairs), and endowed [[scholarship]]s or fellowships.

In the United States, the endowment is often integral to the financial health of educational institutions. Alumni or friends of institutions sometimes contribute capital to the endowment. The use of endowment funding is strong in the United States and Canada but less commonly found outside of North America, with the exceptions of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] universities. Endowment funds have also been created to support secondary and elementary school districts in several states in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Kansas incorporated its first public school district endowment association in [[Paola, Kansas]], a small town of 5,000 people, in 1983. Today, it has approximately $2&amp;nbsp;million in endowed principal, which generates approximately $110,000 annually to distribute in scholarships to high school graduates and fund special projects in the district, which can not be afforded by the tax base. To promote the development of endowment associations across Kansas, USD 368 Endowment Association, which received a statewide award recognizing, has developed a "starter kit" to assist other Kansas school districts in the organization and establishment of new endowment associations.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endowed professorships===
An endowed [[professor]]ship (or '''endowed chair''') is a position permanently paid for with the revenue from an endowment fund specifically set up for that purpose. Typically, the position is designated to be in a certain department. The donor might be allowed to name the position. Endowed professorships aid the university by providing a faculty member who does not have to be paid entirely out of the operating budget, allowing the university to either reduce its student-to-faculty ratio, a statistic used for [[College and university rankings|college rankings]] and other institutional evaluations, and/or direct money that would otherwise have been spent on salaries toward other university needs. In addition, holding such a professorship is considered to be an honour in the academic world, and the university can use them to reward its best faculty or to recruit top professors from other institutions.&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;[http://celebrate.cornell.edu/learn/mentor4.html Cornell's "Celebrating Faculty" Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050501174434/http://celebrate.cornell.edu/learn/mentor4.html |date=2005-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endowed scholarship/fellowship===
An endowed [[scholarship]] is tuition (and possibly other cost) assistance that is permanently paid for with the revenue of an endowment fund specifically set up for that purpose. It can be either merit-based or need-based (which is only awarded to those students for whom the college expense would cause their family financial hardship) depending on university policy or donor preferences. Some universities will facilitate donors' meeting the students they are helping. The amount that must be donated to start an endowed scholarship can vary greatly.

Fellowships are similar, although they are most commonly associated with graduate students. In addition to helping with tuition, they may also include a stipend. Fellowships with a stipend may encourage students to work on a [[doctorate]]. Frequently, teaching or working on research is a mandatory part of a fellowship.

==Financial operation==
A financial endowment is typically overseen by a board of [[trustee]]s and managed by a trustee or team of professional managers. Typically, the financial operation of the endowment is designed to achieve the stated objectives of the endowment.

At universities, typically 4–6% of the endowment's assets are spent every year to fund operations or capital spending.  Any excess earnings are typically reinvested to augment the endowment and to compensate for inflation and recessions in future years.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/54660|title=SO NICELY ENDOWED!|author=|date=31 July 2004|website=newsweek.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This spending figure represents the proportion that historically could be spent without diminishing the principal amount of the endowment fund. However, the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] had a major impact on the entire range of endowments globally.

Most notably, large U.S.-based college and university endowments, which had posted large, highly publicized gains in the 1990s and 2000s faced significant losses of principal across a range of investments. The [[Harvard University]] endowment fund, which held $37 billion on June 30, 2008, was reduced to $26 billion during the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonherald.com/business/general/view/20090911harvard_fund_loses_11b_decline_less_than_predicted/ Harvard fund loses $11B], a September 11, 2009 article from the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915194554/http://www.bostonherald.com/business/general/view/20090911harvard_fund_loses_11b_decline_less_than_predicted/ |date=September 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Yale University]], the pioneer of an approach that involved investing heavily in alternative investments such as real estate and [[private equity]], reported an endowment of $16 billion as of September 2009, a 30% annualized loss that was more than predicted in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125261190641700555 Yale Endowment Down 30%] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414092025/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125261190641700555 |date=2018-04-14 }}, a September 10, 2009 article from ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Stanford University]], the endowment was reduced from about $17 billion to $12 billion as of September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/02/BAQ519HJA6.DTL Stanford University endowment loses big] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906103714/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2009%2F09%2F02%2FBAQ519HJA6.DTL |date=2009-09-06 }}, a September 3, 2009 article from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brown University]]'s endowment fell 27 percent to $2.04 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=ajuf5s.QOqzY|title=404.

In Canada, after the financial crisis in 2008, [[University of Toronto]] reported a loss of 31% ($545 million) of its previous year-end value in 2009. The loss is attributed to over-investment in hedge funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burrows |first=Malcom D. |title=The End of Endowments? |year=2010 |journal=The Philanthropist |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=52–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quasi-endowments==
A quasi-endowment, or fund functioning as an endowment, are funds merely earmarked by an organization's governing board, rather than restricted by a donor or other outside agency, to be invested to provide income for a long but unspecified period, and the governing board has the right to decide at any time to expend the principal of such funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =Not-for-Profit Organizations |journal = AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide | page = 367  | publisher = [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] | date =May 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Separately from the endowment versus quasi-endowment distinction, there's another 2-way categorization of restricted and unrestricted, which focuses on the use of the funds. As an example, a quasi-endowment might be restricted by the donor to supporting the tennis team; the use is restricted to one purpose, but the governing board could "invade principal" to support the tennis team.

{{Nihongo|'''''Fushūgaku'''''|不就学}} is a Japanese term meaning non-attendance of [[Education in Japan|school]].

== Characteristics ==
There are a number of reasons as to why these children do not go to school. There are many cases where they cannot understand the Japanese language. In other cases they may be able to understand both Japanese and their own [[Mother tongue|native language]], but their level of conversation is insufficient to participate in class lessons. Bullying by native Japanese students may also contribute to their choice not to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan’s all too tentative opening to immigration|url=http://www.japanwatching.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98:japans-all-too-tentative-opening-to-immigration&amp;catid=36:society&amp;Itemid=2|publisher=Japan Watching|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the children have parents who both work to support the family, and the children end up being left at [[Latchkey kid|home alone]]. In these families, they spend time together late at night after their parents stop working. On their parents' day off, they go out late at night together (shopping, etc.) They pass their time at autonomous Japanese language classrooms that were built for the children of foreigners. These parents are usually [[blue-collar worker]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Other reasons are that the parents of ''fushugaku'' children want their children to go to a school where they would use their native language. However, such schools cost between 30,000 and 50,000 yen per month, so parents cannot afford to send their children.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

{{Political campaigning}}'''Grassroots fundraising''' is a common [[fundraising]] method used by political candidates, which has grown in popularity with the emergence of the [[Internet]] and its use by US presidential candidates like [[Howard Dean]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Ron Paul]], and most recently [[Bernie Sanders]]. Grassroots fundraising is a way of [[Campaign finance|financing their campaigns]] for candidates who don't have significant media exposure of front runner status, or who are perhaps in opposition to the powerful [[lobby group]]s which influence the political party nominating process. It often involves mobilizing [[grassroots]] support to meet a specific fundraising goal or sets a specific day for grassroots supporters to donate to the campaign. Grassroots [https://network.progressivetech.org/system/files/A%20Definition%20of%20Grassroots%20Fundraising%20_%20Opportunity%20Knocks%E2%80%9D.pdf fundraising] can also be a method for organizations to get as many people as possible to give and strategically get people involved.  This method encompasses the efforts to reach out to the community being served and gaining connections and resources for one's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://66.39.48.85/sites/default/files/incite_files/resource_docs/6634_lip-npic.pdf|title=the revolution will not be funded|last=Moral|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies of Grassroots Fundraising ==
There are several methods of undertaking grassroots fundraising, including:

===Reaching Donors===

Peer-to-peer fundraising growth has been promoted by the increased use of affiliations and donor networks. Amongst a younger peer group that views their age mates as role models who they can trust for advice. Peer networks have continued to expand in many ways, extending towards the traditional door-to-door or solicitation at the places of work. Grassroots in the modern age involves extensive use of e-mail communication, internet websites, and for monetary support.

===Recurring Contributions===

[[Nonprofit organization|Non-profit]] donors benefit effectively from a system that contributes monthly. Accepting little amounts can reduce the absolute financial burden and anxiety that a donor experiences, yet amounting to large amounts over time.

===Mixing Advocacy and Grassroots Fundraising===

Most people prefer to support in different ways hence this strategy provides them with multiple calls-to-action in the campaign communications. For example, a campaign was done from the international Rescue Committee to reach out to their supporters as a response to presidents Donald Trump's refugee ban. They gave their supporters a variety to get into the campaign:

* Advocacy: to tell the president to end the refugee ban.
* Fundraising: Donate to help support the refugee family relocation fees.

===Timely Campaigns===

These aspects go hand in hand with the present events and the news cycle. Research has shown that the content are most viral if the message makes people angry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-emotion-goes-viral-fastest-180950182/|title=What Emotion Goes Viral the Fastest?|last=Shaer|first=Matthew|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; normally the call-to-action and campaign should be:

*     Specific
*     Inspiring
*     Timely
*     Urgent

===Easily Understood Data===

Understanding what inspires the supporters is key to engaging effectively with them. Such information when targeted to them causes support gained from them to improve, the opportunities they'd enjoy and the kinds of communications they prefer. Some demographics such as gender and age are easy to understand while others are not. Therefore one should keep track of data as much as possible. Ultimately, this strategy allows you to understand what is best for the supporters.

===Segmented Campaign Outreach===

Since not all of the campaign messages should be sent to every supporter group. Therefore, the organizations data can be used to segment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.repequity.com/blog/amazing-segmentation-insights-advocacy-campaign|title=Amazing Segmentation Insights from an Advocacy Campaign|date=2017-03-07|work=REQ|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the supporters into sensible groups.

===Focusing on A Single Campaign===

There are very many legislative actions taken every year (more than 1.5 million). Therefore there is the need to be picky when it comes to advocacy and grassroots campaigns.

== History in the United States ==

In the 2000 elections, 66.1% of campaign contributions of $200 or less came from American households earning less than $100,000, who make 86.6% of the general population, but only 14.3% of the contributions over $200 come from these households.&lt;ref name=Obama&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackprof.com/?p=1720 |title=Obama Leads Grassroots Fundraising |publisher=blackprof.com |author=Spencer Overton |authorlink=Spencer Overton |date=2007-04-17 |accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 Democratic presidential primaries===
In 2004, presidential candidate Howard Dean built up his campaign around grassroots fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/jan-june04/dean_2-18.html |title=Howard Dean Ends His Campaign for President |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |date=2004-02-18 |accessdate=2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Jeff Howe, Dean described a $2,000-per-plate fundraising lunch organized by Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] for [[George W. Bush]]'s re-election. In response, Dean challenged his supporters to come to their computers with him "for lunch". Dean was able to match the amount raised by Cheney's fundraiser. He remarked, on his use of the Internet to raise funds for his campaign, "The Internet isn't magic, it's just a tool that can be used to do things differently."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/2003.html |work=Interview |author=Jeff Howe |title=The Candidate - Howard Dean |publisher=Wired |date=September 2003 |accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 presidential primaries===
According to Spencer A. Overton, a professor at [[George Washington University]], [[Barack Obama|Obama]]'s presidential campaign received the most grassroots fundraising of presidential candidates in the first Quarter 2007 based on contributions under $200 with $5.77 million, more than double the nearest candidate, John McCain, who got $2.54 million. Out of Obama's quarter fundraising total, 22% came from contributions under $200 with McCain again second at 19%. However, candidates outside the top tier received larger portions of their funds in contributions under $200 with Tancredo at 78%, Brownback 61%, Paul 39% and Kucinich at 68%.&lt;ref name=Obama/&gt;

In the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Republican primaries]], presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]] has made significant use of the Internet to organize grassroots fundraising efforts. His [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008|campaign]] is unique in seeing many grassroots fundraising events begin completely independent of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/Story?id=3822989&amp;page=2 |title=Who are Ron Paul's Donors? |author=Byron Wolf Z. |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of these was the November 5, 2007 "[[moneybomb]]", spread [[Viral advertising|virally]] through forums like [[YouTube]] and [[Myspace]]. It managed to earn Paul $4.2 million in one day, breaking the online fundraising record as well as raising more than any other Republican candidate in the election. [[Ed Rollins]], the manager of Ross Perot's 1992 presidential campaign, said of Paul's grassroots support, "What he's done{{spaced ndash}}what his supporters have done{{spaced ndash}}is astonishing. You can't dismiss his anti-war vote. You can't dismiss the power of one man standing up with a powerful message. I'll tell you, I've been in politics for 40 years, and these days everything I've learned about politics is totally irrelevant because there's this uncontrollable thing like the Internet. Washington insiders don't know what to make of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2007/11/06/post_184.html |author=Vargas, Jose Antonio |publisher=''[[Washington Post]]'' "The Trail" political blog |title=Paul's Money-Bomb Throwers |date=November 6, 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719223425/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2007/11/06/post_184.html |archivedate=July 19, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inclusion''', in [[education]] refers to the a model wherein [[special needs]] students spend most or all of their time with non-special (general education) needs students.  It arises in the context of special education with an [[individualized education program]] or [[504 plan]], and is built on the notion that it is more effective for students with special needs to have said mixed experience for them to be more successful in social interactions leading to further success in life.  Inclusion rejects but still provides the use of [[special schools]] or classrooms to separate students with disabilities from students without disabilities. Schools with inclusive classrooms do not believe in separate classrooms. They do not have their own separate world so they have to learn how to operate with students while being less focused on by teachers due to a higher student to teacher ratio.

Implementation of these practices varies.  Schools most frequently use the inclusion model for selected students with mild to moderate special needs.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, K.E., Schwartz, I&lt;/ref&gt;  Fully inclusive schools, which are rare, do not separate "general education" and "special education" programs; instead, the school is restructured so that all students learn together.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Scheyer ''et al.'' (1996). The Inclusive Classroom Teacher Created Materials, Inc. ''[http://lib.syndetics.com/hw7.pl?isbn=1557348804/LC.JPG The Inclusive Classroom]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusive education differs from the 'integration' or '[[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreaming]]' model of education, which tended to be concerned principally with disability and special educational needs, and learners changing or becoming 'ready for' or deserving of accommodation by the mainstream.  By contrast, inclusion is about the child's right to participate and the school's duty to accept the child.

A premium is placed upon full participation by students with disabilities and upon respect for their social, civil, and educational rights.  Feeling included is not limited to physical and cognitive disabilities, but also includes the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age and of other forms of human differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Inclusive Design|url=http://idrc.ocadu.ca/about-the-idrc|website=Inclusive Design Research Centre|publisher=OCAD University|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett wrote, "student performance and behaviour in educational tasks can be profoundly affected by the way we feel, we are seen and judged by others.  When we expect to be viewed as inferior, our abilities seem to diminish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Richard|last2=Pickett|first2=Kate|title=The Spirit Level- Why Equity is Better for Everyone|date=2010|publisher=Penguin Books|location=England|isbn=978-0-241-95429-4|pages=113|edition=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration and mainstreaming==
Inclusion has different historical roots which may be integration of students with severe disabilities in the US (who may previously been excluded from schools or even lived in institutions)&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J. &amp; Ferguson, D. (1985). A summary of strategies utilized in model programs and resource materials. In: S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Integration of Students with Severe Handicaps in Regular Schools''. Washington, DC: The Council for Exceptional Children.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schnorr, R. (1990). Peter? He comes and goes...First graders' perspectives on a part-time mainstream student. ''Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 15(4): 231-240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forest, M. (1986, winter). Education Integration/Integracion Scolaire. ''Entourage'', 1(1): 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt; or an inclusion model from Canada and the US (e.g., Syracuse University, New York) which is very popular with inclusion teachers who believe in participatory learning, cooperative learning, and inclusive classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Sapon-Shevin, M., Ayres, B., &amp; Duncan, J. (1994). Cooperative learning and inclusion. In: J. S. Thousand, R.A. Villa, &amp; A.I. Nevins, ''Creativity and Collaborative Learning: A Practical Guide to Empowering Students and Teachers''. (pp. 45-58). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusive education differs from the early university 
  professor's work (e.g., 1970s, Education Professor Carol Berrigan of Syracuse University, 1985; Douglas Biklen, Dean of School of Education through 2011) in ''[[Educational integration|integration]]'' and ''mainstreaming''&lt;ref&gt;Biklen, D. (1985). ''Achieving the Complete School: Strategies for Effective Mainsreaming''. NY, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which were taught throughout the world including in international seminars in Italy. Mainstreaming (e.g., the Human Policy Press poster; If you thought the wheel was a good idea, you'll like the ramp)tended to be concerned about "readiness" of all parties for the new coming together of students with significant needs. Thus, integration and mainstreaming principally was concerned about disability and 'special educational needs' (since the children were not in the regular schools) and involved teachers, students, principals, administrators, School Boards, and parents changing and becoming 'ready for'&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, C., Palombaro, M., &amp; Hollowood, T. (1993). On the nature and change of an inclusive elementary school. ''JASH'', 18(2): 75-84.&lt;/ref&gt; students who needed accommodation or new methods of curriculum and instruction (e.g., required federal IEPs – [[individualized education program]])&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, P., Goetz, L., &amp; Anderson, J. (1986, Summer). The quality of IEP objectives associated with placement on integrated versus segregated school sites. ''The Journal of The Association for Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 11(2): 125-130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snell, M. &amp; Browder, D.M. (1986, Spring). Community-referenced instruction: Research and issues. ''JASH'', 11(1): 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; by the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, P.S. (1994, Spring). Judgment of the social validity of instructional strategies used in community-based instructional sites. ''JASH'', 19(1): 43-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). Table 6.3: Curriculum for students with severe handicaps. ''Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support''. (p. 134). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford, A. &amp; Davern, L. (1989). Moving forward on school integration: Strategies for involving studennt with severe disabilities in the life of the school. In: R. Gaylord-Ross, ''Integration Strategies for Persons with Handicaps''. (pp. 11-31). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, inclusion is about the child’s right to participate and the school’s duty to accept the child returning to the US Supreme Court's Brown vs. the Board of Education decision and the new Individuals with Disabilities Education (Improvement) Act (IDEIA).  Inclusion rejects the use of [[special schools]] or classrooms, which remain popular among large multi-service providers, to separate students with disabilities from students without disabilities.  A premium is placed upon full participation by students with disabilities, in contrast to earlier concept of partial participation in the mainstream,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L., Schwarz, P., Udvari-Solner, A., Kampchroer, E., Johnson, F., Jorgensen, J., &amp; Gruenewald, L. (1991, Spring). How much time should students with severe intellectual disabilities spend in regular education classrooms and elsewhere? ''JASH'', 16(1): 39-47.&lt;/ref&gt; and upon respect for their social, civil, and educational rights. Inclusion gives students with disabilities skills they can use in and out of the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;"Students learn the importance of individual and group contributions and develop valuable life skills that are often unexplored in less inclusive settings" (Tapasak 216). Tapasak, Renee and Christine Walther-Thomas. "Evaluation of a First-Year Inclusion Program:Student Perceptions and Classroom Performance." Remedial and Special Education 20(1999): 216-225. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fully inclusive schools and general or special education policies==
Fully inclusive schools, which are rare, no longer distinguish between "general education" and "[[special education]]" programs which refers to the debates and federal initiatives of the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Davis, W. (1989). The regular education initiative debate: Its promises and pitfalls. ''Exceptional Children'', 55(5): 440-446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, J. (1989). The regular education initiative as Reagan-Bush education policy: A trickle down theory of the education of the hard-to-teach. ''The Journal of Special Education'', 23(3): 256- 278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stainback, S. &amp; Stainback, W. (1984). A rationale for the merger of special and regular education. ''Exceptional Children'', 51: 102-11.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Community Integration Project&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, J. &amp; Meyer, L. (1986). Principles and practices for school integration of students with severe disabilities: An overview of the literature. In: M. Berres &amp; P. Knoblock, ''Managerial Models of Mainstreaming''. Rockville, MD: Aspen.&lt;/ref&gt; and the debates on home schools and special education-regular education classrooms;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L., Long, E., Udvari-Solner, A., Schwarz, P., VenDeventer, P., et al. (1989, Spring). Should students with severe intellectual disabilities be based in regular or in special education classrooms in home schools? ''Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 14(1): 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt; instead, the school is restructured so that all students learn together.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sailor, W. (1991, November/December). Special education in the restructured school. ''Remedial and Special Education'', 12(6): 8-22.&lt;/ref&gt; All approaches to inclusive schooling require administrative and managerial changes to move from the traditional approaches to elementary and high school education.&lt;ref&gt;Sage, D.D. (1996). Administrative strategies for achieving inclusive schooling. (pp. 105-116). In: S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Inclusion: A Guide for Educators''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion remains in 2015 as part of school (e.g., Powell &amp; Lyle, 1997, now to the most integrated setting from LRE)&lt;ref&gt;Powell, D. &amp; Hyle, A. (12997, May). Principals and school reform: Barriers to inclusion in three secondary schools. ''Journal of School Leadership'', Volume 7: 301-326&lt;/ref&gt; and educational reform initiatives in the US&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy, T.G. (1989). Book Review of D. K. Liptsky and A. Gartner, ''School Reform for All Students: An Essay Review of Beyond Separate Education: Quality Education for All''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; and other parts of the world. Inclusion is an effort to improve quality in education in the fields of disability, is a common theme in educational reform for decades,&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J., (1999). ''Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support''. (p. 219). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN, 2006). Inclusion has been researched and studied for decades, though reported lighly in the public with early studies on heterogeneous and homogeneous ability groupings (Stainback &amp; Stainback, 1989),&lt;ref&gt;Stainback, W. &amp; Stainback, W. C. (1989). Classroom organization for diversity among students. In: D. Biklen, D. Ferguson &amp; Al Ford, ''Schooling and Disability''. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; studies of critical friends and inclusion facilitators (e.g., Jorgensen &amp; Tashie, 2000),&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C. &amp; Tashie, C. (2000). Turning points: The story of high school inclusion in New Hampshire. (pp. 131-176). In: J. Nisbet &amp; D. Hagner, ''Part of the Community''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; self-contained to general education reversal of 90% (Fried &amp; Jorgensen, 1998),&lt;ref&gt;Fried, R.L. &amp; Jorgensen, C.M (1998). Equity and excellence: Finding common ground between inclusive education and school reform. In: C. M. Jorgensen, ''Restructuring High School For All Students''. (pp. 15–28). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; among many others obtaining doctoral degrees throughout the US.

==Classification of students and educational practices==
Classification of students by disability is standard in educational systems which use diagnostic, educational and psychological testing, among others. However, inclusion has been associated with its own planning, including MAPS which Jack Pearpoint leads with still leads in 2015&lt;ref&gt;Forest, M. &amp; Pearpoint, J.. (1992). MAPS: Action planning. (pp. 52–56). In: J. Pearpoint, M. Forest, &amp; J. Snow, ''The Inclusion Papers: Strategies to Make Inclusion Work''. Toronto, Canada: The Inclusion Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[person-centred planning]] with John O'Brien and Connie Lyle O'Brien who view inclusion as a force for school renewal.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. &amp; Lyle O'Brien, C. (1996). Inclusion as a force for school renewal. In : S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Inclusion: A Guide for Educators''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion has two sub-types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/inclusion.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 1, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrE8sgg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/inclusion.html |archivedate=November 1, 2009 |df= }} Definition of inclusion, accessed October 11, 2007.  2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; the first is sometimes called '''regular inclusion''' or '''partial inclusion''', and the other is '''full inclusion'''.&lt;ref name=Bowe&gt;Bowe, Frank.  (2005).  ''Making Inclusion Work''.  Merrill Education/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Inclusive practice'' is not always inclusive but is a form of integration.  For example, students with special needs are educated in regular classes for nearly all of the day, or at least for more than half of the day.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt; Whenever possible, the students receive any additional help or special instruction in the general classroom, and the student is treated like a full member of the class. However, most specialized services are provided outside a regular classroom, particularly if these services require special equipment or might be disruptive to the rest of the class (such as [[speech therapy]]), and students are pulled out of the regular classroom for these services.  In this case, the student occasionally leaves the regular classroom to attend smaller, more intensive instructional sessions in a [[resource room]], or to receive other related services, such as speech and language therapy, [[occupational therapy|occupational]] and/or [[physical therapy]], psychological services, and social work.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt; This approach can be very similar to many [[mainstreaming in education|mainstreaming]] practices, and may differ in little more than the educational ideals behind it.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt;

In the "full inclusion" setting, the students with special needs are always educated alongside students without special needs, as the first and desired option while maintaining appropriate supports and services. Some educators say this might be more effective for the students with special needs.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingPsychology&gt;"Understanding Psychology Eighth Edition", Feldman, Robert S. (2008), page 309. Retrieved 2010-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the extreme, full inclusion is the integration of all students, even those that require the most substantial educational and behavioral supports and services to be successful in regular classes and the elimination of special, segregated special education classes.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingPsychology/&gt; Special education is considered a service, not a place and those services are integrated into the daily routines (See, ecological inventories) and classroom structure, environment, curriculum and strategies and brought to the student, instead of removing the student to meet his or her individual needs. However, this approach to full inclusion is somewhat controversial, and it is not widely understood or applied to date.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingPsychology/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Student teachers' attitudes toward the inclusion of children with special needs. Educational Psychology,'' Hastings. R.P., &amp; Oakford, S. (2003), page 23, 87-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mainstreaming to full inclusion: From orthogenesis to pathogenesis of an idea. International Journal of Disability, Development, and Education,'' Kavale, K.A. (2002), page 49, 201-214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Attitudes of elementary school principals toward the inclusion of students with disabilities. Exceptional Children,'' Praisner, C. L. (2003), page 69, 135-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much more commonly, local educational agencies have the responsibility to organize services for children with disabilities. They may provide a variety of settings, from special classrooms to mainstreaming to inclusion, and assign, as teachers and administrators often do, students to the system that seems most likely to help the student achieve his or her individual educational goals.  Students with mild or moderate disabilities, as well as disabilities that do not affect academic achievement, such as using power [[wheelchair]], scooter or other mobility device, are most likely to be fully included; indeed, children with polio or with leg injuries have grown to be leaders and teachers in government and universities; self advocates travel across the country and to different parts of the world. However, students with all types of disabilities from all the different disability categories (See, also 2012 book by Michael Wehmeyer from the University of Kansas) have been successfully included in general education classes, working and achieving their individual educational goals in regular school environments and activities (reference needed).

===Alternatives to inclusion programs: school procedures and community development===
Students with disabilities who are not included are typically either mainstreamed or segregated.

A [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreamed]] student attends some general education classes, typically for less than half the day, and often for less academically rigorous, or if you will, more interesting and career-oriented classes.  For example, a young student with significant [[intellectual disabilities]] might be mainstreamed for physical education classes, art classes and storybook time, but spend reading and mathematics classes with other students that have similar disabilities ("needs for the same level of academic instruction"). They may have access to a [[resource room]] for remediation or enhancement of course content, or for a variety of group and individual meetings and consultations.

A segregated student attends no classes with non-disabled students with disability a tested category determined before or at school entrance.  He or she might attend a [[special school]] termed residential schools that only enrolls other students with disabilities, or might be placed in a dedicated, self-contained classroom in a school that also enrolls general education students.  The latter model of integration, like the 1970s Jowonio School in Syracuse, is often highly valued when combined with teaching such as [[Montessori education]] techniques. Home schooling was also a popular alternative among highly educated parents with children with significant disabilities.

Residential schools have been criticized for decades, and the government has been asked repeatedly to keep funds and services in the local districts, including for family support services for parents who may be currently single and raising a child with significant challenges on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). ''Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support for All''. Binghamton, NY: The Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Children with special needs may already be involved with early childhood education which can have a [[family support]] component emphasizing the strengths of the child and family.&lt;ref&gt;Dunst, C.J. &amp; Trivette, C.M. (2012). Capacity-building family-system intervention practices. (pp. 33–57). In: G.H. S. Singer, Biegel, D.E. &amp; Conway, P., ''Family Support and Family Caregiving across Disabilities''. London &amp; NY, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some students may be confined to a hospital due to a medical condition (e.g., cancer treatments) and are thus eligible for tutoring services provided by a school district.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C., Schuh, M., &amp; Nisbet, J. (2005). The inclusion facilitator's guide. Baltimore: Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;  Less common alternatives include [[homeschooling]]&lt;ref name="NCES"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/homeschool/TableDisplay.asp?TablePath=TablesHTML/table_4.asp|title=Homeschooling in the United States: 2003 - Table 4: Number and percentage of homeschooled students whose parents reported particular reasons for homeschooling as being applicable to their situation and as being their most important reason for homeschooling: 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trentin G. &amp; Benigno V.

==Legal issues: education law and disability laws==
The new anti-discriminatory climate has provided the basis for much change in policy and statute, nationally and internationally. Inclusion has been enshrined at the same time that segregation and discrimination have been rejected. Articulations of the new developments in ways of thinking, in policy and in law include:
* The UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1989) which sets out children’s rights in respect of freedom from discrimination and in respect of the representation of their wishes and views.
* The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] of [[UNESCO]] prohibits any discrimination, [[social exclusion|exclusion]] or [[racial segregation|segregation]] in education.

===From the least restrictive to the most integrated setting===
For [[special education in the United States|schools in the United States]], the federal requirement that students be educated in the historic [[least restrictive environment]] that is [[reasonable]] encourages the implementation of inclusion of students previously excluded by the school system.&lt;ref&gt;Karp, N. &amp; Taylor, S.J. (1988). ''The Least Restrictive Environment and Community Integration: A Leadership Institute''. Washington, DC and Syracuse, NY: National Institute on Disability Research and Rehabilitation and Syracuse University, Center on Human Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, M., Blacher, J., Duffy, S., Hardman, M., McDonnell, J., Nisbet, J., Safer, N., &amp; Snell, M.

Washington, DC: The Arc of the US and the American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a critical critique of the LRE principle, commonly used to guide US schools, indicates that it often places restrictions and segregation on the individuals with the most severe disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J. (1988, Spring). Caught in the continuum: A critical analysis of the principles of the least restrictive environment. ''JASH'', 13(1): 41-53.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1980s, individuals with significant disabilities and their families and caregivers were already living quality lives in homes and local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J., Racino, J., Knoll, J., &amp; Lutfiyya, Z.M.

Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; as described by the national Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, which should result in better achievement of national integration and inclusion goals in the 21st Century.

==Inclusion rates in the world: "frequency of use"==
The proportion of students with disabilities who are ''included'' varies by place and by type of disability, but it is relatively common for students with milder disabilities and less common with certain kinds of severe disabilities.  In Denmark, 99% of students with [[learning disabilities]] like 'dyslexia' are placed in general education classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Vouchers Help the Learning Disabled:  Lesson from 22 countries: Special-education students thrive in private schools

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, three out of five students with learning disabilities spend the  majority of their time in the general education classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Cortiella, C. (2009). [http://www.ncld.org/stateofld The State of Learning Disabilities.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706072327/http://www.ncld.org/stateofld |date=2009-07-06 }} New York, NY: National Center for Learning Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt;

Postsecondary statistics (after high school) are kept by universities and government on the success rates of students entering college, and most are eligible for either disability services (e.g., accommodations and aides) or programs on college campuses, such as supported education in psychiatric disabilities or College for Living. The former are fully integrated college degree programs with college and vocational rehabilitation services (e.g., payments for textbooks, readers or translators), and the latter courses developed similar to retirement institutes (e.g., banking for retirees).

==Principles and necessary resources==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2016}}Although once hailed,{{By whom|date=August 2016}} usually by its opponents, as a way to increase achievement while decreasing costs, full inclusion does not save money, but is more cost-beneficial and cost-effective. It is not designed to reduce students' needs, and its first priority may not even be to improve academic outcomes; in most cases, it merely moves the special education professionals (now dual certified for all students in some states) out of "their own special education" classrooms and into a corner of the general classroom or as otherwise designed by the "teacher-in-charge" and "administrator-in-charge".  To avoid harm to the academic education of students with disabilities, a full panoply of services and resources is required (of education for itself), including:&lt;ref&gt;This list from the [[Utah Education Association]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adequate supports and services for the student
* Well-designed [[individualized education program]]s
* Professional development for all teachers involved, general and special educators alike
* Time for teachers to plan, meet, create, and evaluate the students together
* Reduced class size based on the severity of the student needs
* Professional skill development in the areas of cooperative learning, peer tutoring, adaptive curriculum
* Collaboration between parents or guardians, teachers or para educators, specialists, administration, and outside agencies.
* Sufficient funding so that schools will be able to develop programs for students based on student need instead of the availability of funding.
Indeed, the students with special needs do receive funds from the federal government, by law originally the Educational for All Handicapped Children Act of 1974 to the present day, Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, which requires its use in the most integrated setting.

In principle, several factors can determine the success of inclusive classrooms:
* Family-school partnerships
* Collaboration between general and special educators
* Well-constructed plans that identify specific accommodations, modifications, and goals for each student
* Coordinated planning and communication between "general" and "special needs" staff
* Integrated service delivery
* Ongoing training and staff development
* Leadership of teachers and administrators

By the mid-1980s, school integration leaders in the university sector already had detailed schemas (e.g., curriculum, student days, students with severe disabilities in classrooms) with later developments primarily in assistive technology and communication, school reform and transformation, personal assistance of user-directed aides, and increasing emphasis on social relationships and cooperative learning.  In 2015, most important are evaluations of the populations still in special schools, including those who may be deaf-blind, and the leadership by inclusion educators, who often do not yet go by that name, in the education and community systems.

===Differing views of inclusion and integration===
However, early integrationists{{Who|date=August 2016}} [[community integration]] would still recommend greater emphasis on programs related to sciences, the arts (e.g., exposure), curriculum integrated field trips, and literature as opposed to the sole emphasis on community referenced curriculum. For example, a global citizen studying the environment might be involved with planting a tree ("independent mobility"), or going to an arboretum ("social and relational skills"), developing a science project with a group ("contributing ideas and planning"), and having two core modules in the curriculum.

However, students will need to either continue to secondary school (meet academic testing standards), make arrangements for employment, supported education, or home/day services (transition services), and thus, develop the skills for future life (e.g., academic math skills and calculators; planning and using recipes or leisure skills) in the educational classrooms. Inclusion often involved individuals who otherwise might be at an institution or residential facility.

Today, longitudinal studies follow the outcomes of students with disabilities in classrooms, which include college graduations and quality of life outcomes. To be avoided are negative outcomes that include forms of institutionalization.

==Common practices in inclusive classrooms==
Students in an inclusive classroom are generally placed with their chronological age-mates, regardless of whether the students are working above or below the typical academic level for their age.  Also, to encourage a sense of belonging, emphasis is placed on the value of friendships. Teachers often nurture a relationship between a student with special needs and a same-age student without a special educational need. Another common practice is the assignment of a [[wikt:buddy|buddy]] to accompany a student with special needs at all times (for example in the cafeteria, on the playground, on the bus and so on). This is used to show students that a diverse group of people make up a community, that no one type of student is better than another, and to remove any barriers to a friendship that may occur if a student is viewed as "helpless." Such practices reduce the chance for elitism among students in later grades and encourage cooperation among groups.&lt;ref&gt;Strully, J., &amp; Strully, C. (1996). Friendships as an educational goal: What we have learned and where we are headed. In W. Stainback &amp; S. Stainback (Eds.), ''Inclusion: A guide for educators''. Baltimore: Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers use a number of techniques to help build classroom communities:
* Using games designed to build community
* Involving students in solving problems
* Sharing songs and books that teach community
* Openly dealing with individual differences by discussion
* Assigning classroom jobs that build community
* Teaching students to look for ways to help each other
* Utilizing [[physical therapy]] equipment such as [[standing frames]], so students who typically use wheelchairs can stand when the other students are standing and more actively participate in activities
* Encouraging students to take the role of teacher and deliver instruction (e.g. read a portion of a book to a student with severe disabilities)
* Focusing on the strength of a student with special needs
* Create classroom checklists
* Take breaks when necessary
* Create an area for children to calm down
* Organize student desk in groups
* Create a self and welcoming environment
* Set ground rules and stick with them
* Help establish short-term goals
* Design a multi-faced curriculum
* Communicate regular with parents and/or caregivers
* Seek support from other special education teachers

'''Inclusionary practices are commonly utilized by using the following team-teaching models:'''
* One teach, one support:
In this model, the content teacher will deliver the lesson and the special education teacher will assist students individual needs and enforce classroom management as needed.
* One teach, one observe:
In this model, the teacher with the most experience in the content will deliver the lesson and the other teacher will float or observe.  This model is commonly used for data retrieval during IEP observations or Functional Behavior Analysis.
* Station teaching (rotational teaching):
In this model, the room is divided into stations in which the students will visit with their small groups.  Generally, the content teacher will deliver the lesson in his/her group, and the special education teacher will complete a review or adapted version of the lesson with the students.
* Parallel teaching:
In this model, one half of the class is taught by the content teacher and one half is taught by the special education teacher.  Both groups are being taught the same lesson, just in a smaller group.
* Alternative teaching:
In this method, the content teacher will teach the lesson to the class, while the special education teacher will teach a small group of students an alternative lesson.
* Team teaching (content/support shared 50/50):
Both teachers share the planning, teaching, and supporting equally.  This is the traditional method, and often the most successful co-teaching model.

===Children with extensive support needs===
For children with significant or severe disabilities, the programs may require what are termed health supports (e.g., positioning and lifting; visit to the nurse clinic), direct one-to-one aide in the classroom, assistive technology, and an individualized program which may involve the student "partially" (e.g., videos and cards for "visual stimulation"; listening to responses)in the full lesson plan for the "general education student". It may also require introduction of teaching techniques commonly used (e.g., introductions and interest in science) that teachers may not use within a common core class.

Another way to think of health supports are as a range of services that may be needed from specialists, or sometimes generalists, ranging from speech and language, to visual and hearing (sensory impairments), behavioral, learning, orthopedics, autism, deaf-blindness, and traumatic brain injury, according to Virginia Commonwealth University's Dr. Paul Wehman.&lt;ref&gt;Wehman, P. (1997). ''Exceptional Individuals in School, Community and Work''. Austin, TX: PRO-ED.&lt;/ref&gt; As Dr. Wehman has indicated, expectations can include post secondary education, supported employment in competitive sites, and living with family or other residential places in the community.

In 2005, comprehensive health supports were described in National Goals for Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities as universally available, affordable and promoting inclusion, as supporting well-informed, freely chose health care decisions, culturally competent, promoting health promotion, and insuring well trained and respectful health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, D., Bacon, A., Birenbaum, A., Campbell, V., Cerreto, M., Corbin, S., Crocker, A., Krahn, G., McClain, C., McDermott, Nehring, W., Pietrangelo, R., Rader, R., Spitalnik, D. &amp; White-Scott, S.(2005). Comprehensive health support and health promotion. (pp.109-124).  In: K. C. Lakin &amp; A. Turnbull, ''National Goals and Research for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities''. Washington, DC: The Arc of the US and American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, mental health, behavioral, communication and crisis needs may need to be planned for and addressed.
 
"Full inclusion" – the idea that all children, including those with severe disabilities, can and should learn in a regular classroom has also taken root in many school systems, and most notably in the province of New Brunswick.

==Collaboration among the professions==
Inclusion settings allow children with and without disabilities to play and interact every day, even when they are receiving therapeutic services. When a child displays fine motor difficulty, his ability to fully participate in common classroom activities, such as cutting, coloring, and zipping a jacket may be hindered.  While occupational therapists are often called to assess and implement strategies outside of school, it is frequently left up to classroom teachers to implement strategies in school. Collaborating with occupational therapists will help classroom teachers use intervention strategies and increase teachers' awareness about students' needs within school settings and enhance teachers' independence in implementation of occupational therapy strategies.

As a result of the 1997 re-authorization of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|Individuals With Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA), greater emphasis has been placed on delivery of related services within inclusive, general education environments. [Nolan, 2004] The importance of inclusive, integrated models of service delivery for children with disabilities has been widely researched indicating positive benefits. [Case-Smith&amp; Holland, 2009] In traditional "pull out" service delivery models, children typically work in isolated settings one on one with a therapist, Case-Smith and Holland(2009) argue that children working on skills once or twice a week are "less likely to produce learning that leads to new behaviors and increased competence." [Case Smith &amp;Holland, 2009, pg.419]. In recent years, occupational therapy has shifted from the conventional model of "pull out" therapy to an integrated model where the therapy takes place within a school or classroom.

Inclusion administrators have been requested to review their personnel to assure mental health personnel for children with mental health needs, vocational rehabilitation linkages for work placements, community linkages for special populations (e.g., "deaf-blind", "autism"), and collaboration among major community agencies for after school programs and transition to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Rusch, F.R., Destefano, L., Chadsey-Rusch, J., Phelps, L.A., &amp; Szymanski, E. (1992). ''Transition from School to Adult Life: Models, Linkages and Policy''. Sycamore, IL: Sycamore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schall, C. &amp; McFarland-Whisman, J. (2009). Meeting transition goals through inclusion. (pp.95-110). In: P. Wehman, Datlow-Smith, M. &amp; Schall, C., ''Autism and the Transition to Adulthood: Success Beyond the Classroom''. Sydney, Australia: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Highly recommended are collaborations with parents, including parent-professional partnerships in areas of cultural and linguistic diversity (e.g., Syracuse University's special education Ph.D.'s Maya Kaylanpur and Beth Harry).

==Selection of students for inclusion programs in schools==
Educators generally say that some students with special needs are not good candidates for inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Doug. "Transformation Ahead for Special Education"  ''The Arizona Republic.'' 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Many schools expect a fully included student to be working at or near [[grade level]], but more fundamental requirements exist:  First, being included requires that the student is able to attend [[school]].  Students that are entirely excluded from school (for example, due to long-term hospitalization), or who are educated outside of schools (for example, due to enrollment in a [[distance education]] program) cannot attempt inclusion.

Additionally, some students with special needs are poor candidates for inclusion because of their effect on other students.  For example, students with severe behavioral problems, such that they represent a serious physical danger to others, are poor candidates for inclusion, because the school has a duty to provide a safe environment to all students and staff.

Finally, some students are not good candidates for inclusion because the normal activities in a general education classroom will prevent them from learning.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt;  For example, a student with severe attention difficulties or extreme [[sensory processing disorder]]s might be highly distracted or distressed by the presence of other students working at their desks. Inclusion needs to be appropriate to the child's unique needs.

Most students with special needs do not fall into these extreme categories, as most students do attend school, are not violent, do not have severe sensory processing disorders, etc.

The students that are most commonly included are those with physical disabilities that have no or little effect on their academic work ([[diabetes mellitus]], [[epilepsy]], [[food allergies]], [[paralysis]]), students with all types of mild disabilities, and students whose disabilities require relatively few specialized services.

Bowe says that regular inclusion, but not full inclusion, is a reasonable approach for a significant majority of students with special needs.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt;  He also says that for some students, notably those with severe [[autism spectrum]] disorders or [[mental retardation]], as well as many who are [[deaf]] or have multiple disabilities, even regular inclusion may not offer an appropriate education.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt; Teachers of students with autism spectrum disorders sometimes use antecedent procedures, delayed contingencies, self-management strategies, peer-mediated interventions, [[pivotal response training]] and naturalistic teaching strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sonja R. de Boer |title=Successful inclusion for students with autism: creating a complete, effective ASD inclusion program |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=San Francisco |year=2009 |pages=38–42 |isbn=0-470-23080-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to progressive education ==
Some advocates of inclusion promote the adoption of [[progressive education]] practices.  In the progressive education or inclusive classroom, everyone is exposed to a "rich set of activities", and each student does what he or she can do, or what he or she wishes to do and learns whatever comes from that experience. [[Maria Montessori]]'s schools are sometimes named as an example of inclusive education.

Inclusion requires some changes in how teachers teach, as well as changes in how students with and without special needs interact with and relate to one another.  Inclusive education practices frequently rely on active learning, [[Authentic assessment|authentic assessment practices]], applied curriculum, multi-level instructional approaches, and increased attention to diverse student needs and individualization.

sometimes it is not necessary that there will always be a positive environment and therefore a lot of attention of the teachers is also required along with the support of other children which will ensure a peaceful and happy place for both kinds of children.

==Arguments for full inclusion in regular neighborhood schools==
Advocates say that even partial non-inclusion is morally unacceptable.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;Stainback, W., &amp; Stainback, S. (1995). ''Controversial Issues Confronting Special Education''. Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents believe that non-inclusion reduces the disabled students' social importance and that maintaining their social visibility is more important than their academic achievement. Proponents say that society accords disabled people less [[human dignity]] when they are less visible in general education classrooms. Advocates say that even if typical students are harmed academically by the full inclusion of certain special needs students, that the non-inclusion of these students would still be morally unacceptable, as advocates believe that the harm to typical students' education is always less important than the social harm caused by making people with disabilities less visible in society.&lt;ref name=SS /&gt;

A second key argument is that everybody benefits from inclusion. Advocates say that there are many children and young people who don't fit in (or feel as though they don't), and that a school that fully includes all disabled students feels welcoming to all. Moreover, at least one author has studied the impact a diversified student body has on the general education population and has concluded that students with mental retardation who spend time among their peers show an increase in social skills and academic proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Trainer, M. (1991). ''Differences in common: Straight talk on mental retardation, Down Syndrome, and life''. Rockville, MD" Woodbine house.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for inclusion say that the long-term effects of typical students who are included with special needs students at a very young age have a heightened sensitivity to the challenges that others face, increased empathy and compassion, and improved leadership skills, which benefits all of society.&lt;ref&gt;Giangreco, M.F., Cloninger, C.J., &amp; Iverson, V.S.(1998). Choosing outcomes and accommodations for Children (COACH): A guide to educational planning for students with disabilities (2nd ed.). Baltimore: Paul H Brookes Publishing Co&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination of inclusion and pull-out (partial inclusion) services has been shown to be beneficial to students with learning disabilities in the area of reading comprehension, and preferential for the special education teachers delivering the services.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, Douglas. ''The Journal of Special Education'', Vol. 30, No. 2, 121–132 (1996)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusive education can be beneficial to all students in a class, not just students with special needs. Some research show that inclusion helps students understand the importance of working together, and fosters a sense of tolerance and empathy among the student body.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, R.M. (2004). The effects of cooperative learning on junior high school students during small group learning. ''Learning and Instruction'' there are inclusion units and other rooms in some schools which focus on these aspects, 14(2), 197–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive effects in regular classrooms==
There are many positive effects of inclusions where both the students with special needs along with the other students in the classroom both benefit. Research has shown positive effects for children with disabilities in areas such as reaching individualized education program (IEP) goal, improving communication and social skills, increasing positive peer interactions, many educational outcomes, and post school adjustments.  Positive effects on children without disabilities include the development of positive attitudes and perceptions of persons with disabilities and the enhancement of social status with non-disabled peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, T., Deluca, D., &amp; Bruns, D. (1997). Putting inclusion into practice: perspectives of teachers and parents. ''Exceptional Children,'' 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Several studies have been done on the effects of inclusion of children with disabilities in general education classrooms. A study on inclusion compared integrated and segregated (special education only) preschool students. The study determined that children in the integrated sites progressed in social skills development while the segregated children actually regressed.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, P., &amp; Carey, D. (1995). The Sociometric status of students with disabilities in a full-inclusion school. ''Exceptional Children,'' 62.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Another study shows the effect on inclusion in grades 2 to 5.  The study determined that students with specific learning disabilities made some academic and affective gains at a pace comparable to that of normal achieving students.  Specific learning disabilities students also showed an improvement in [[self-esteem]] and in some cases improved motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Banerji, M., &amp; Dailey, R. (1995). A Study of the effects of an inclusion model on students with specific learning disabilities. ''Journal of Learning Disabilities,'' 28(8), 511-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third study shows how the support of peers in an inclusive classroom can lead to positive effects for children with [[autism]].  The study observed typical inclusion classrooms, ages ranging from 7 years old to 11 years old.  The peers were trained on an intervention technique to help their fellow autistic classmates stay on task and focused.  The study showed that using peers to intervene instead of classroom teachers helped students with autism reduce off-task behaviors significantly.  It also showed that the typical students accepted the student with autism both before and after the intervention techniques were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Use of a peer support intervention for promoting academic engagement of students with autism in general education settings|last = McCurdy|first = E.

L.|volume = 44|issue = 4|pages = 883–893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of inclusion programs of school districts==
Critics of full and partial inclusion include educators, administrators and parents. Full and partial inclusion approaches neglect to acknowledge the fact that most students with significant special needs require individualized instruction or highly controlled environments.  Thus, general education classroom teachers often are teaching a curriculum while the special education teacher is remediating instruction at the same time.  Similarly, a child with serious inattention problems may be unable to focus in a classroom that contains twenty or more active children. Although with the increase of incidence of disabilities in the student population, this is a circumstance all teachers must contend with, and is not a direct result of inclusion as a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Barkley, R.A. (1998). ''Attention deficit hyperactivity disorders: A handbook for diagnosis and treatment'' (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Full inclusion may be a way for schools to placate parents and the general public, using the word as a phrase to garner attention for what are in fact illusive efforts to educate students with special needs in the general education environment.&lt;ref&gt;JM Kauffman, DP Hallahan.''The Illusion of Full Inclusion: A Comprehensive Critique of a Current Special Education Bandwagon''. PRO-ED, Inc., 8700 Shoal Creek Blvd., Austin, TX 78757-6897&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one study examined the lack of individualized services provided for students with IEPs when placed in an inclusive rather than mainstreamed environment.&lt;ref&gt;Espin, C.A.Individualized Education Programs in Resource and Inclusive Settings.''The Journal of Special Education'', Vol. 32, No. 3, 164–174 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have maintained school districts neglect to prepare general education staff for students with special needs, thus preventing any achievement. Moreover, school districts often expound an inclusive philosophy for political reasons, and do away with any valuable pull-out services, all on behalf of the students who have no so say in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, Laurence M. ''Preserving Special Education''. Weston: Nobb Hill Press Inc, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion is viewed by some as a practice philosophically attractive yet impractical.  Studies have not corroborated the proposed advantages of full or partial inclusion. Moreover, "push in" servicing does not allow students with moderate to severe disabilities individualized instruction in a [[resource room]], from which many show considerable benefit in both learning and emotional development.&lt;ref&gt;An Investigation of the Effectiveness of Resource Rooms for Children with Specific Learning Disabilities Lawrence H. Weiner Journal of Learning Disabilities, Apr 1969; vol. 2: pp. 223 - 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents of disabled students may be cautious about placing their children in an inclusion program because of fears that the children will be ridiculed by other students, or be unable to develop regular life skills in an academic classroom.&lt;ref&gt;This information provided by SEDL.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that inclusive schools are not a cost-effective response when compared to cheaper or more effective interventions, such as [[special education]].  They argue that special education helps "fix" the special needs students by providing individualized and personalized instruction to meet their unique needs.  This is to help students with special needs adjust as quickly as possible to the mainstream of the school and community.  Proponents counter that students with special needs are not fully into the mainstream of student life because they are secluded to special education.  Some argue that isolating students with special needs may lower their self-esteem and may reduce their ability to deal with other people.  In keeping these students in separate classrooms they aren't going to see the struggles and achievements that they can make together. However, at least one study indicated [[mainstreaming in education]] has long-term benefits for students as indicated by increased test scores,&lt;ref&gt;van den Bos, K.P., Nakken, H., Nicolay, P.G.,&amp; van Houten, E.J. (2007). Adults with mild intellectual disabilities: Can their reading comprehension ability be improved? ''Journal of Intellectual Disability Research'', 51(11), 830–845.&lt;/ref&gt; where the benefit of inclusion has not yet been proved.

== Broader approach: social and cultural inclusion ==
As used by UNESCO,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0017/001778/177849e.pdf|title=Policy Guidelines on Inclusion in Education|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; inclusion refers to far more than students with special educational needs.  It is centered on the inclusion of  marginalized groups, such as religious, racial, ethnic, and linguistic minorities, immigrants, girls, the poor, students with disabilities, HIV/AIDS patients, remote populations, and more.  In some places, these people are not actively included in education and learning processes.&lt;ref name="PolicyGuidelines"&gt;UNESCO (2009) Policy Guidelines on Inclusion in Education. UNESCO: Paris. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0017/001778/177849e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. this broader definition is also known as "culturally responsive" education, which differs from the 1980s-1990s cultural diversity and cultural competency approaches,&lt;ref&gt;Harry, B.

(1992). Reading between the lines and beyond the pages: A culturally relevant approach to literacy teaching.  Theory Into Practice, 31(4), 312-320.&lt;/ref&gt; points out that teachers who are culturally responsive know how to base learning experiences on the cultural realities of the child (e.g. home life, community experiences, language background, belief systems). Proponents argue that [http://ea.niusileadscape.org/lc/Record/137?search_query=Culturally%20Responsive culturally responsive pedagogy] is good for all students because it builds a caring community where everyone's experiences and abilities are valued.

Proponents want to maximize the participation of all learners in the community schools of their choice and to rethink and restructure policies, curricula, cultures and practices in schools and learning environments so that diverse learning needs can be met, whatever the origin or nature of those needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bps.org.uk/downloadfile.cfm?file_uuid=CE1DCB9D-1143-DFD0-7EA9-5C1B82EA4596&amp;ext=doc British Psychological Society position statement on inclusive education&lt;/ref&gt;  They say that all students can learn and benefit from education, and that schools should adapt to the physical, social, and cultural needs of students, rather than students adapting to the needs of the school. Proponents believe that individual differences between students are a source of richness and diversity, which should be supported through a wide and flexible range of responses. The challenge of rethinking and restructuring schools to become more culturally responsive calls for a complex systems view of the educational system (e.g.see Michael Patton&lt;ref name="Developmental Evaluation"&gt;Patton, M. (2011). Developmental evaluation: Applying complexity concepts to enhance innovation and use. New York, NY, The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;), where one can extend the idea of strength through diversity to all participants in the educational system (e.g. parents, teachers, community members, staff).

Although inclusion is generally associated with elementary and secondary education, it is also applicable in postsecondary education.  According to UNESCO, inclusion "is increasingly understood more broadly as a reform that supports and welcomes diversity amongst all learners."&lt;ref name="PolicyGuidelines" /&gt;  Under this broader definition of inclusion, steps should also be taken to eliminate discrimination and provide accommodations for all students who are at a disadvantage because of some reason other than disability.

===Benefiting in an inclusive environment===
"The inclusion of age-appropriate students in a general education classroom, alongside those with and without disability is beneficial to both parties involved. (Waitoller and Thorius) With inclusive education, all students are exposed to the same curriculum, they develop their own individual potential, and participate in the same activities at the same time. Therefore, there is a variety of ways in which learning takes place because students learn differently, at their own pace and by their own style. (Carter, Moss, Asmus, Fesperman, Cooney, Brock, Lyons, Huber, and Vincent) Effectively, inclusive education provides a nurturing venue where teaching and learning should occur despite pros and cons. It is evident that students with disabilities benefit more in an inclusive atmosphere because they can receive help from their peers with diverse abilities and they compete at the same level due to equal opportunities given."

The '''Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage''' ('''INTACH''') is a non-profit charitable organisation registered under the [[Societies' Registration Act]], 1860.

In 2007, the [[United Nations]] awarded INTACH a special [[consultative status]] with [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://esango.un.org/civilsociety/showProfileDetail.do?method=showProfileDetails&amp;profileCode=3029 Civil Society Participation &gt; Consultative Status&gt;Profile] ''[[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]'' Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hin"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/30/stories/2007103051980300.htm INTACH gets special status for its efforts] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 30 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Copper Age Tool - ACCN 93-51 - Prehistory and Terracotta Gallery - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 6248.JPG|thumb|150px| The INTACH logo has been derived from this 3000-year-old anthropomorphic copper figure (ACCN 93-51) found at Shahabad, UP, now at [[Government Museum, Mathura]].&lt;ref&gt;"INTACH." INTACH. N.p., n.d. Web. 27 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
INTACH was founded in 1984 in [[New Delhi]] with the vision to create a membership organisation to stimulate and spearhead heritage awareness and conservation in [[India]].

Since 1984, INTACH has pioneered the conservation and protection of India's natural and cultural heritage and is today the largest membership organisation in the country dedicated to conservation.

Today it has chapters in 170 Indian cities, as well as chapters in [[Belgium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intach.be Intach Belgium]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]].

The Memorandum of Association and Rules and Regulations of INTACH constituted the first Governing Council of the Trust with the following members:
[[Rajiv Gandhi]], [[Pupul Jayakar]], [[L. K. Jha]], Prof. [[M. G. K. Menon]], Dr [[Kapila Vatsyayan]], [[Rajeev Sethi]], [[B. K. Thapar]], [[Martand Singh]], [[Bilkees I. Latif]], [[Madhavrao Scindia]], and J. B. Dadachanji.

In 2007, INTACH signed a memorandum of understanding with [[AusHeritage]], Australia's noted heritage network, to collaborate on [[South Asia]]n and [[South East Asia]]n regional initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausgovindia.com/ndli/PA0807.html Cultural Heritage Cooperation: INTACH and "AusHeritage" sign MoU] [[Diplomatic missions of Australia|Australian High Commission]], [[India]], 2 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Among the tasks undertaken by INTACH are restoration of monuments and their management; advocacy for heritage property conservation; public awareness through heritage walks and buses;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/delhi-in-queue-to-ride-the-heritage-bus/393473/ Delhi in queue to ride the heritage bus] ''[[Indian Express]]'', 3 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; establishment of heritage clubs in schools;&lt;ref name=hinhy/&gt; and holding of awareness workshop for teachers of schools and colleges&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/34201033.cms INTACH trains teachers on protecting heritage] ''[[Times of India]]'', 13 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/33704836.cms INTACH holds awareness workshop for teachers] ''[[Times of India]], 8 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and heritage walks to various unprotected sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Potpourri/Guiding_the_cultural_ambassadors_/articleshow/3809504.cms Guiding the cultural ambassadors] ''[[Times of India]]'', 9 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-12-09/kolkata/27930257_1_heritage-buildings-heritage-structures-heritage-hotel Centre push for heritage revival] [[Kolkata]], ''[[Times of India]]'', 9 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, INTACH has taken up restoration and protection of hundreds of monuments that fall outside the coverage of [[Archaeological Survey of India]] and other government agencies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-08-14/india/27920787_1_monuments-intach-indian-national-trust 60,000 monuments at nature's mercy, says INTACH] ''[[Times of India]]'', 14 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and at times local authorities hand over the upkeep and restoration of heritage structures to INTACH directly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2004/06/11/stories/2004061114630300.htm Maintenance of Kurupam monument for INTACH ] ''[[The Hindu]], 11 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

INTACH has established chapters not only within India but also outside it. It now uses funds raised by its international chapters in Belgium and the United Kingdom, to take up restoration, conservation and protection projects of historical structures and heritage buildings across India.&lt;ref name=hin/&gt;

After developing [[Raghurajpur]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], a place famous for its master ‘[[Pattachitra]]’ artists and ‘[[Gotipua]]’ dance troupes as a heritage village, which has now become a major rural tourist destination, it later used the same pattern to develop Padmanabhpur village, [[Ganjam district]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], famous for its weavers and folk dancers, into another heritage destination.

In 2007, the government of [[Goa]] signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with INTACH for restoration, conservation and maintenance of 51 officially listed heritage and cultural monuments in the state.  This includes the restoration and conservation of the 16th century [[Reis Magos#Reis Magos Fort|Reis Magos Fort]] in [[Goa]],&lt;ref name=hin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/11/stories/2007101157960200.htm INTACH to develop village in Ganjam district] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 11 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/20/stories/2007092052340300.htm Goa, INTACH signs MoU to preserve monuments] Special Correspondent, [[The Hindu]], 20 Sep 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; then in 2008, INTACH signed anouth a memorandum of understanding with the [[Government of Delhi]] for the conservation of 92 monuments in Delhi, in the preparation of the [[Commonwealth Games 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/intach-delhi-govt-pact-for-conservation-of-92-monuments-on-route-of-2010-games/379167/ Intach, Delhi Govt pact for conservation of 92 monuments on route of 2010 Games] Express News Service, [[Indian Express]], 30 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The INTACH logo ==
The INTACH Logo, based on the anthropomorphic copper figure from Shahabad, Uttar Pradesh, belonging to the enigmatic [[Copper Hoard Culture|Copper Hoards of the Ganga Valley]] (circa 1800—1700 BC) is the perceived brand image of INTACH. The classic simplicity and vitality of its lines make it a striking example of primitive man’s creative genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = INTACH|url = http://www.intach.org/about-logo.php|website = www.intach.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
INTACH’s mission&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = INTACH|url = http://www.intach.org/about-mission.php|website = www.intach.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; to conserve heritage is based on the belief that living in harmony with heritage enhances the quality of life, and it is the duty of every citizen of India as laid down in the Constitution of India. The objectives spelt out in the Memorandum of Association constitute INTACH’s Mandate and Vision. Its stated mission to date continues to be:
* Sensitise the public about the pluralistic cultural legacy of India
* Instill a sense of social responsibility towards preserving India’s common heritage
* Protect and preserve India’s living, built, and natural heritage by undertaking necessary actions and measures
* Document unprotected buildings of archaeological, architectural, historic and aesthetic significance, as well as the cultural resources, as this is the first step towards formulating conservation plans
* Develop heritage policies and regulations, and make legal interventions to protect India’s heritage when necessary
* Provide expertise in the field of conservation, restoration and preservation of specific works of art; and encourage capacity-building by developing skills through training programmes
* Undertake emergency response measures during natural or man-made disasters and support the local administration whenever heritage is threatened
* Foster collaborations, Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) and partnerships with government and other national and international agencies
* Generate sponsorships for conservation and educational projects
To achieve the above-stated mission, at subsequent Visioning Exercises further measures were spelt out:
* INTACH must widen and strengthen its base so as to involve people in caring for our common heritage, as outlined in the objectives of the Memorandum of Association of the Society
* INTACH should develop into a highly competent and efficient organization of first recourse in all matters concerning Built (Architectural), Natural, Art (Material), Intangible (Living) Heritage in the country by building the requisite professional and other skills, both at its Central Office and at the Chapter level
* INTACH should strive to become the primary advisor on all matters pertaining to protection, conservation and preservation of heritage for the central government, the state governments (including institutions, agencies and organizations under them, such as the Armed Forces), and for institutions of decentralised governance such as the Panchayati Raj Institutions in the rural areas, for the urban local bodies (municipalities, metropolitan authorities, cantonment boards, etc.), and also the Corporate and Public Sectors
* INTACH should put into place an effective system of networking with other like-minded organizations and build a mutual support system

==Awards==
INTACH bestows the following awards:
* The '''Anirudh Bhargava – INTACH Environmental Award'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intach.org/awards.asp?links=award1&lt;/ref&gt; has been instituted in the memory of his son by Dr. Ranjit Bhargava, INTACH Life Member and facilitated by a grant. 
* '''INTACH Award for Best Practices in Heritage Conservation'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intach.org/awards-heritage-conservation.asp?links=award4&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The '''INTACH-SATTE Heritage Tourism Award''' recognizes "inspiring and innovative work done by individuals/organization/ institutions" in a number of areas including "reuse of heritage concepts and properties for tourism purposes".&lt;ref name="hinhy"&gt;[http://www.intach.org/awards-satte.asp?links=award2 INTACH-2008 SATTE - INTACH Heritage Tourism Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==INTACH UK Trust==
The '''INTACH UK Trust''', established in 1987, is a registered charity in the United Kingdom funded by the Charles Wallace bequest. The aim of this trust is to support the cause of heritage conservation in India.

Its two main activities are:
* Funding projects in India
* Providing scholarships to British scholars for heritage research projects in India

==Collaborations==
In recent years INTACH has been fortunate to receive support from the central government and several state governments, corporate houses and international agencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14717">An '''international medical graduate''' ('''IMG'''), earlier known as a '''foreign medical graduate''' ('''FMG'''), is a [[physician]] who has graduated from a medical school outside of the country where he or she intends to practice. Generally, the medical school of graduation is one listed in the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED) as accredited by the [[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research]] or the [[World Health Organization]].

Medical schools around the world vary in education standards, curricula, and evaluation methods. Many countries have their own certification program, equivalent to the ECFMG in the United States. The purpose of [[ECFMG]] Certification is to assess the readiness of international medical graduates to enter clinical specialty training programs as [[resident physician]]s and fellowship programs in the United States.

== License requirements by country ==

The requirements to obtain a license to practice varies by country and often by state or province.

===Australia===
{{main article|Overseas trained doctors in Australia}}

IMGs (or Overseas Trained Doctors) who wish to be licensed in [[Australia]] must apply to the [[Australian Medical Council|Australian Medical Council (AMC)]] to arrange an appropriate assessment pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/pub/downloads/359-applying-to-amc|title=IMG guides:   Applying to the Australian Medical Council| publisher= Australian Medical Council |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard pathway involves an IMG sitting a series of assessments, including AMC MCQ Exam and AMC clinical exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/ass/apo/sp |title= Assessments &amp; examinations: Standard pathway| publisher= Australian Medical Council |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMC MCQ Exam consists of 150 MCQs organized through computer adaptive scoring.

For AMC clinical exam, a candidate is required to pass 12 out of 16 cases including one compulsory case in each of Gyne and pediatrics.

Those IMGs who have passed the necessary exams and obtained AMC certification can then apply to an Australian specialty training positions.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080613222254/http://www.amc.org.au/prelim1.asp]

Australia is in the process of establishing a national registration process for all the doctors under Medical Board of Australia.

In 2010 the [[Minister for Health and Ageing (Australia)]] launched an [[Inquiry process into registration and accreditation processes for international medical graduates]] which reported in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=haa/overseasdoctors/report.htm | title=Inquiry into Registration Processes and Support for Overseas Trained Doctors | publisher= Parliament of Australia | accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Several organizations have put pressure on the government such as the Association For Access to Health Care Services, and Association of International Physicians and Surgeons of [[Ontario]]. Bill 97, Increasing Access to Qualified Health Professionals for Ontarians Act, was passed in 2008, requiring the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada|College of Physicians and Surgeons]] to provide adequate numbers of doctors by issuing transitional licenses. However, the college has not complied with the law.

In addition to undergoing the regular licensing process as required of all Canadian medical school graduates, IMGs must pass the [[Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada|LMCC]] Evaluating Examination. IMGs in Canada also have a harder time getting into residency programs compared to Canadian graduates &amp;mdash; only ten percent of IMG applicants get a position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readersdigest.ca/health/healthy-living/why-canada-shutting-out-doctors readersdigest.ca - Why Is Canada Shutting Out Doctors?]: "In 2003, 625 international graduates competed. Only 67—about ten percent—found a position"&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates of United States M.D. programs are ''not'' considered IMGs and are thus exempt from the Evaluating Examination; graduates of U.S. osteopathic medical schools ''are'' considered IMGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcc.ca/en/exams/ee/apply.shtml |title=Evaluating Examination: Apply |publisher=Medical Council of Canada |accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{update section|date=December 2017}}
[[Image:2007ACGME-2.PNG|250px|right]][[Image:2007ACGME-3.PNG|250px|right]]
Graduates of Canadian M.D. programs are ''not'' considered IMGs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfmg.org/2010ib/ibfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions: 1.

The purpose of ECFMG Certification is to assess whether graduates of these schools are ready to enter U.S. residency and fellowship programs that are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian physician with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] are qualified to take the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE]]. However, since the 2010s, the process of obtaining a license was becoming increasingly complicated&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/economy/long-slog-for-foreign-doctors-to-practice-in-us.html&lt;/ref&gt; India has exported more physicians to the United States than any other foreign nation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16774871&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pathway====
The main pathway for IMGs who wish to be licensed as physicians in the [[United States]] is to complete a U.S. [[residency (medicine)|residency]] hospital program. The general method to apply for residency programs is through the [[National Resident Matching Program]] (abbreviated NRMP, also called "the Match"). To participate in the NRMP, an IMG is required to have an [[ECFMG certification]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/ind_app/verif_new.html nrmp.org &gt; Independent Applicants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084648/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/ind_app/verif_new.html |date=2011-07-21 }} Updated 09/08/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; by the "rank order list certification deadline" time (usually in February of the year of the match).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/yearly.html nrmp.org &gt; 2012 Main Match Schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716035954/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/yearly.html |date=2011-07-16 }} Updated 05/19/2011&lt;/ref&gt; To acquire an ECFMG certification, the main requirements are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfmg.org/2011ib/ibmec.html ecfmg.org &gt; Medical Education Credentials] Last update: September 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Completion of [[USMLE Step 1]], [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge]] and [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills]]
*A medical diploma of [[medical education]] taken at an institution registered in the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED)
In comparison, regular graduates from medical schools in the United States and Canada need to complete USMLE Steps 1 and 2 as well, but can participate in the NRMP while still doing their final year of medical school before acquiring their medical diplomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/us_seniors/registration.html nrmp.org &gt; U.S. Seniors &gt; Registering with the NRMP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084824/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/us_seniors/registration.html |date=2011-07-21 }} Updated August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, taking regular administrative delays into account, and with residency programs starting around July, there is a gap of at least half a year for IMGs between graduation from medical school and beginning of a residency program.

Those IMGs who have passed the necessary [[USMLE]] exams and obtained the ECFMG certification can then apply to U.S. residency positions via the [[NRMP]] and [[Electronic Residency Application Service|ERAS]].

USMLE exam scores are considered in the [[National Resident Matching Program#International medical graduates|matching process]] for entering a residency program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Catherine Rampell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/economy/long-slog-for-foreign-doctors-to-practice-in-us.html|title=Path to United States Practice Is Long Slog to Foreign Doctors|publisher=New York Times|date=August 11, 2018|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study came to the result that almost half of IMGs were unsuccessful in their first attempts in the pursuit of a U.S. residency position, and three-quarters began a residency after five years.&lt;ref name=jolly2011&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/742193?src=mp&amp;spon=25 Participation in U.S. Graduate Medical Education by Graduates of International Medical Schools] By Jolly, Paul PhD; Boulet, John PhD; Garrison, Gwen PhD; Signer, Mona M. MPH. Posted: 05/23/2011; ''Academic Medicine''. 2011;86(5):559-564.&lt;/ref&gt; It also indicated that IMGs were considerably older when they first applied for a residency position than are most U.S. medical graduates, with mean age of IMGs when the ECFMG certificate was issued being 32.4 years, with a standard deviation of 5.8 years.&lt;ref name=jolly2011/&gt;

All applicants to residency programs in [[California]] need a ''{{visible anchor|Postgraduate Training Authorization Letter}}'' (PTAL), colloquially called a "California Letter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ö/www.ecfmg.org/eras/applicants-documents-pta.html Postgraduate Training Authorization Letter (PTAL) or “California Letter”], [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]]. Last updated June 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Obtainment of a PTAL requires graduation from a [[medical school]] listed by the Medical Board of California, which is more stringent than the [[International Medical Education Directory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fm.mednet.ucla.edu/IMG/residency/PTAL.asp University of California, Los Angeles - PTAL], Updated January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It also requires having a [[Social Security number]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbc.ca.gov/Applicants/Physicians_and_Surgeons/#8 The Medical Board of California - Physicians and Surgeons]. Retrieved May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning [[United States visa|visa]] requirements, non-U.S.-citizen doctors usually enter via the J1 or the H-1B visa. The J1 reqires a 2-year home residence after completion of training in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/life-career/immigration-information-international-medical-graduates|title=Immigration Information for International Medical Graduates|publisher=American Medical Association|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The H-1B visa does not have this 2-year home residence requirement, but further requires the [[USMLE Step 3]]. And initially, a B-1 visitor visa is required for taking the USMLE Step 2 clinical skills examination and the USMLE Step 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seak.com/blog/uncategorized/10-biggest-immigration-mistakes-physicians-make/|title=The 10 Biggest Immigration Mistakes Physicians Make|website=www.seak.com|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality of care==
One study examining quality of care by international medical graduates is noted as follows.  "One-quarter of practicing physicians in the United States are graduates of international medical schools. The quality of care provided by doctors educated abroad has been the subject of ongoing concern. Our analysis of 244,153 hospitalizations in Pennsylvania found that patients of doctors who graduated from international medical schools and were not U.S. citizens at the time they entered medical school had significantly lower mortality rates than patients cared for by doctors who graduated from U.S. medical schools or who were U.S. citizens and received their degrees abroad. The patient population consisted of those with congestive heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. We found no significant mortality difference when comparing all international medical graduates with all U.S. medical school graduates".&lt;ref name=Norcini_1467&gt;{{Harvnb|Norcini|2010|pp=1467}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data on older Medicare patients admitted to hospital in the US showed that patients treated by international graduates had lower mortality than patients cared for by US graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.j273 |title=Quality of care delivered by general internists in US hospitals who graduated from foreign versus US medical schools: observational study |publisher=BMJ |date=3 February 2017| doi=10.1136/bmj.j273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iren Dimitrova''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: Ирен Димитрова) (born 1950) is a [[Bulgaria]]n piano player and tutor of piano accompaniment and chamber music.

==Life==
Dimitrova studied at the [[National Academy of Music (Bulgaria)|National Music Academy]] of [[Bulgaria]] in the piano class of prof. P. [[:bg:Панка Пелишек|Pelishek]], after which she specialised in chamber music and piano accompaniment at the Russian Academy of Music [[Gnessin State Musical College|Gnesin]], Moscow where she received her PhD. She enjoyed a long performance and teaching career, and taught chamber music and piano accompaniment in the National Art School of Varna,&lt;ref&gt;http://varnasummerfest.org/participants_bg_2.php?page=news_show_search&amp;newsID=337&amp;nsID=12&lt;/ref&gt; piano at the [[Varna Free University]] "Chernorizets Hrabar", at the [[Shumen University|University of Shumen]] "Constantine of Preslav" and the Higher Institute of Music of Sfax. Dimitrova is one of the first pedagogues in Bulgaria who dedicated their life to the piano accompaniment and chamber music teaching and her activity greatly contributed to the development of these disciplines in the country. In 2011 she was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ubmd.org/static_info.php?id=18&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Hiram Bedford''' (April 20, 1893&amp;nbsp;– January 12, 1967) was an American psychology professor at the [[University of California]] who wrote several books on occupational counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Robert Cecil, ed. ''Who's Who in American Education'', 1928, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the first person whose body was [[Cryopreservation|cryopreserved]] after legal death, and who remains preserved at the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Perry | first=Mike | title=A Freezing Before Bedford’s | work=Physical Immortality 2(2) 7 (2nd Q 2004) | publisher=Depressed metabolism   | url=http://www.depressedmetabolism.com/a-freezing-before-bedfords/ | access-date=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galenpress.com/extras/extra32.htm|title=GALEN PRESS Medical Book Extras SOULS ON ICE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Dr James Hiram Bedford | publisher=[[Find A Grave]]   | date=July 26, 2008 | url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/28544550  | access-date=2008-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cryonic body preservation ==
In June 1965, Ev Cooper’s [[Life Extension Society]] (LES) offered the opportunity  to preserve one person free of charge, stating that "the Life Extension Society now has primitive facilities for emergency short term freezing and storing our friend the large [[homeothermy|homeotherm]] (man). LES offers to freeze free of charge the first person desirous and in need of cryogenic suspension." Bedford did not take this opportunity, however, but later used his own funds.

April 1966 saw the first case in history of a body being frozen with some thought of future reanimation. It had been embalmed for two months, and was placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at just above freezing point. The middle-aged woman from Los Angeles, whose name is unknown, was soon thawed out and buried by relatives.&lt;ref name="alcor1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alcor.org/Library/html/suspensionfailures.html |title=Suspension Failures - Lessons from the Early Days |publisher=Alcor.org |date=February 1992 |access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bedford suffered from [[kidney cancer]] that had later [[Metastasis|metastasized]] into his [[lung]]s, a condition that was untreatable at the time.&lt;ref name="dear dr. bedford"&gt;{{cite web | title=Dear Dr. Bedford (and those who will care for you after I do) | publisher=Cryonics   | date=July 1991 | url=http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/BedfordLetter.htm  | access-date=2009-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bedford left $100,000 to cryonics research in his will, but more than this amount was utilized by Bedford's wife and son in court, having to defend his [[will and testament|will]] and his [[cryopreservation]] due to arguments created by other relatives.&lt;ref name="dear dr. bedford" /&gt;

Bedford's body was [[freezing|frozen]] a few hours after his death due to natural causes related to his cancer.&lt;ref name="dear dr. bedford" /&gt; His body was preserved by [[Robert Prehoda]] (author of the 1969 book ''Suspended Animation''), Dr. [[Dante Brunol]] (physician and biophysicist) and Robert Nelson (President of the [[Cryonics Society of California]]). Nelson then wrote a book about the subject titled ''We Froze the First Man''. Compared to those employed by modern cryonics organizations, the use of cryoprotectants in Bedford's case was primitive. He was injected with [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], a compound once thought to be useful for long-term cryogenics, so it is unlikely that his brain was protected. [[Cryopreservation#methods|Vitrification]] was not yet possible, further limiting the possibility of Bedford's eventual recovery. In his first suspended animation stages, his body was stored at Edward Hope's Cryo-Care facility in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], for two years, then in 1969 moved to the Galiso facility in California. Bedford's body was moved from Galiso in 1973 to Trans Time near [[Berkeley, California]], until 1977, before being stored by his son for many years.&lt;ref name="dear dr. bedford" /&gt;

Bedford's body was maintained in [[liquid nitrogen]] by his family in southern California until 1982, when it was then moved to [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]], and has remained in Alcor's care to the present day.&lt;ref name="perry history"&gt;{{cite web

The examiners concluded that "it seems likely that his external temperature has remained at relatively low subzero temperatures throughout the storage interval."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=Evaluation of the Condition of Dr. James H.

== Personal life ==
Bedford married twice.  His first wife, Anna Chandler Rice, died in 1917, the same year she and Bedford were married.  Bedford married his second wife, Ruby McLagan, in 1920.  Bedford and McLagan had five children: Doris, Donald, Frances, Barbara and Norman. James Bedford enjoyed photography and extensive traveling.&lt;ref name="dear dr. bedford" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3100">'''June King McFee''' (died January 14, 2008) made many contributions to the world of [[art education]], with her research and publications.

Professor Emeritus '''June King McFee''' was Professor and Head of the Department of Art Education at the [[University of Oregon]] from 1965-1983.  She started an internationally recognized doctoral program at the university.

She is best known for advancing cultural understanding through the arts.  In her book, ''Preparation for Art'', McFee 
"portrays graphically the range of individual differences in children's reactions to visual phenomena and visual arts."

McFee believed in teaching art according to a child's needs.  She created the "perception delineation theory" based on [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], and the needs of urban [[children]].  According to her [[theory]], learning is a behavioral adjustment, and the education that society needed was guided change in behavior.

== University of Oregon ==

At the University of Oregon, June King King McFee, along with colleague and faculty member Vincent Lanier, developed strong focuses on community arts and cultural services within the Department of Art Education (ARE). McFee's work was rooted in cultural pluralism, the role of art in society, and the influence people have in their communities related to the arts.

After her tenure as faculty, her influence continued to develop the ARE curriculum. Rogena Degge, a close colleague in the department, went on to develop classes in [[Cultural policy]] based on the work of McFee. She later developed an Art and Society class still taught at the University, at the graduate level.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, E. (2005).

== Publications == 
According to WorldCat Identities, June King McFee has 17 works in 54 publications in 2 languages and 1,751 library holdings. Prominent publications books:
* Preparation for Art
* Art, Culture, and Environment: A Catalyst for Teaching
* Cultural Diversity and the Structure and Practice of Art Education
* Creative Problem Solving Abilities in Art of Academically Superior Adolescents

'''Lydia''' [Yakolevna] '''Lipkowska''' (1882–1958) was a Russian [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] origin.

==Biography==
[[File:LydiaLipkowska1921.tif|thumb|left|upright|&lt;center&gt;Lydia Lipkowska, from ''Music News,'' 1921&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Photo_and_2_drawings_of_Lydia_Lipkowska_by_Marguerite_Martyn,_1910.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Lipkowska in drawings by [[Marguerite Martyn]], with a photo, 1910&lt;/center&gt;]]
Lydia was born in [[Babyn, Kelmentsi|Babyn]], where is a village museum dedicated to her, in the family of a rural teacher. Lydia had three sisters, four brothers. Her aunt was a famous Ukrainian actress Maria Zankovetska. She received education in the Mariinsky Women's Gymnasium in [[Kamyanets-Podilskyi]]. Together with other students, she sang in the church choir, she had her own solo parties, drawing attention with a magic voice that ran under the dome of the cathedral. Residents of Kamyanets called the girl "Singing Bird". After Kamyanets-Podiskyi Lipkowska was trained at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]]. She was committed to the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] from 1906—1908 and again from 1911–1913. She was a member of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in [[New York City]] from 1909&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = New York Times | page = 9 | title = Metropolitan Plans Great Opera Season | date = 13 September 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;  until 1911. Lipkowska's debut with the Metropolitan was as Violetta in ''[[La Traviata]]'' on November 18, 1909, with [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] as Alfredo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = New York Times | date = 19 November 1909 | page = 11 | title = Traviata at Metropolitan: Mme. Lipkowska Makes Debut as Violetta &amp;ndash; Caruso as Alfredo}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sang as a guest artist at the [[Boston Opera Company]] in 1909 and the [[Chicago Grand Opera Company]] in 1910. While in Boston, Lipkowska was honored by [[The Lenox Hotel]], which put on its menu the "cup Lydia" and the "Souffle a la Lipkowska".  She petioned a judge for an injunction against the hotel, claiming that the menu items were "injuring her reputation and holding her up to ridicule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = New York Times | date = 16 February 1910 | page = 3 | title = Declines a Hotel's Homage}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 she made her debut at the [[Royal Opera House]] in London as Mimì in [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]''.

In 1912, Lipkowska charged New York gangster [[Sam Schepps]] with [[usury]] over his refusal to return two diamonds worth $80,000 that she'd pawned to him.  Lipkowska said that she'd borrowed $12,000 from Schepps, had left the diamonds with him as security, and that he sought $5000 in interest before he would return the jewels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = New York Times | date = 23 October 1921 | page = 18 | title = Lipkowska Accuses Broker of Usury}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914 she sang in the world premiere of [[Amilcare Ponchielli]]'s ''[[I Mori di Valenza]]'' at the [[Opéra de Monte-Carlo]].

Lipkowska escaped from the [[Soviet Union]] with her then husband Pierre Bodin in 1920, arriving in New York on the [[RMS Adriatic (1907)|Adriatic]] of the [[White Star Line]] on February 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = New York Times | date = 9 February 1920 | page = 3 | title = Saved From 'Reds,' Singer Here a Bride}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1920, Lipkowska sang Gilda in ''[[Rigoletto]]'' with the [[San Carlo Opera Company]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = New York Times | date = 22 September 1920 | page = 24 | title = 'Rigoletto' at Manhattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After retiring from the stage she lived in Romania where she was active as a voice teacher. One of her students was the soprano [[Virginia Zeani]]. She died in [[Beirut]] at the age of 75. For part of her life she was married to baritone [[Georges Baklanoff]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6532">The '''Advantage Testing Foundation''' '''Math Prize for Girls,''' often referred to as '''The Math Prize for Girls,''' is an annual [[mathematics competition]] open to female high school students from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The competition offers the world’s largest single monetary math prize in a math contest for young women.  In 2017, the First-Place prize was $46,000 (split equally amongst the three-way tie for first) with another $9,000 divided among the remaining finalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mit.edu/2011/math-prize-girls-0920|title=MIT hosts Math Prize for Girls|last1=Chu|first1=Jennifer|website=MIT News|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls may win a maximum of $50,000 by participating in the competition over multiple years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xia|first1=Victoria|date=Nov 2013|title=Reckoning with Randomness|url=http://cty.jhu.edu/imagine/docs/MathPrize.pdf|journal=Imagine Magazine|volume=|pages=12–14|accessdate=5 August 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized each year by the [[Advantage Testing Foundation]], the competition is considered to be the preeminent female math competition for young women in North America.&lt;ref name="MITAdmissions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/math_women_rock|title=Math Women Rock|last1=Peterson|first1=Chris|website=MIT Admissions|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.microsoft.com/newengland/tag/advantage-testing-foundation/|title=Advantage Testing Foundation|last=|first=|date=September 10, 2013|website=Microsoft New England|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-day annual contest is open to female high-school students in 12th grade or below, from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] who have attained a qualifying score on the [[American Mathematics Competitions]] Exams, specifically the [[AMC 10]] or [[AMC 12]] given in February each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/news/math-news/mit-to-host-math-competition-for-girls|title=MIT to Host Math Competition for Girls|website=Mathematical Association of America|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 300 participants are then selected each year for the competition.  Participants must complete 20 short-answer problems in geometry, algebra, [[trigonometry]], and other math topics in 150 minutes. The exams are then reviewed by a panel of judges, who award cash prizes to the top-scoring participants.&lt;ref name="MITnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mit.edu/2014/math-prize-for-girls-offers-inspiration-mentorship-0923|title=Math Prize for Girls offers inspiration and mentorship to participants on MIT’s campus.|last1=Schroeder|first1=Bendta|website=MIT News|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The competition was founded in 2009 by [[Arun Alagappan]] and Dr. Ravi Boppana in an effort to inspire the next generation of [[female mathematicians]] and create a community of young women who share a passion for math.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diverseeducation.com/article/16394|title=Math Prize for Girls Thrives at MIT|last1=Elfman|first1=Lois|website=Diverse Issues in Higher Education|publisher=CMA|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Boppana, the competition’s cofounder and Director, said in a statement that "the Math Prize was created to debunk gender stereotypes, and to support young women who see higher-level mathematics as a pursuit that is challenging, fun, and incredibly rewarding.”&lt;ref name="bostonglobe"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/27/for-girls-rare-chance-flex-math-muscles/WUyteAIjKYvmZXwfxjoWFI/story.html|title=For girls, a rare chance to flex math muscles at MIT|last1=Smith|first1=Jennifer|date=September 27, 2014|accessdate=31 July 2017|publisher=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two years of the competition were held at [[NYU]], and since 2011, the competition has been held annually at [[MIT]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MIT President Susan Hockfield applauds 250 High School Women in Math|last1=Liebman|first1=Lydia|accessdate=9 August 2016|publisher=Education Update|issue=Nov/Dec 2011|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4581">[[Image:Our Whole Lives.jpg|thumb|The Our Whole Lives logo.]]'''Our Whole Lives''', or '''OWL''', is a series of six comprehensive [[Sexual education|sexuality curricula]] for children, [[teenagers]], young adults and [[adults]] published by the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] and the [[United Church of Christ]] [[Justice and Witness Ministries]].&lt;ref&gt;Unitarian Universalist Association Our Whole Lives pages (http://www.uua.org/re/owl). Retrieved on 2007 May 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Church of Christ Our Whole Lives pages (http://www.ucc.org/justice/sexuality_education/our-whole-lives.html). Retrieved on 2007 November 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Publication was the result of seven years of collaborative effort by the two faiths to prepare material which addresses sexuality throughout the lifespan in [[age appropriate]] ways.

The Our Whole Lives program operates under the idea that well informed [[youth]] and young adults make better, healthier decisions about [[human sexuality|sexuality]] than those without complete information. OWL strives to be unbiased and teaches about [[heterosexual]], [[bisexual]], [[homosexual]], and [[transgender]] [[sexual health]]. In addition to information on sex, OWL is intended to help children, youth, and adults to be emotionally healthy and responsible in terms of their sexuality.

==Program structure==
There are four OWL curricula designed for the American school grades of K–1, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12, plus one for young adults (18- to 35-year-olds) and one for adults.

Each session of the Our Whole Lives curriculum can include the "Sexuality and Our Faith" companion, which comes in separate versions, one for the [[Unitarian Universalist Association|UUA]] and [[Canadian Unitarian Council|CUC]] communities and another one for the [[United Church of Christ|UCC]] community. Without "Sexuality and Our Faith," the programs have no religious material and are thus appropriate for use in schools and other non-religious institutions.

==Program values==
Our Whole Lives is built upon four core values:
# Self Worth
# Sexual Health
# Responsibility
# Justice and Inclusivity.

Participants are encouraged to use these values in decision-making concerning their own sexuality and relationships.  Throughout the program, participants are encouraged to explore and learn to articulate their own values.

==Program leaders==
Our Whole Lives classes are led by teams of facilitators recruited from within their congregations.  Before leading Our Whole Lives, facilitators must complete a training program led by certified trainers of trainers.  Training is intensive and focused on building the facilitation skills demanded by Our Whole Lives. In addition to exploring the core values and pedagogical theory underlying Our Whole Lives, trainings include opportunities to peer-facilitate a session, giving future leaders hands-on experience.  At the end of the training (which is approximately 20 hours of training over three days), facilitators must be certified by their trainers before leading Our Whole Lives in their congregations.  

Facilitators for Our Whole Lives work in teams of at least two – one male and one female – for each class.  The gender balance allows participants to feel comfortable raising concerns, questions and issues with their trainers.  For the middle school (grades 7-9) curriculum, some activities are done in gender segregated groups, otherwise all activities take place in mixed gender groups.  Leaders for Our Whole Lives are expected to model the program values - treating participants with respect and honoring their moral agency.

In Unitarian Universalist congregations the grades 7–9 OWL curriculum replaced the somewhat controversial [[About Your Sexuality]], which went out of print in the 1990s.

'''''Pizza Tycoon''''' (known as '''''Pizza Connection''''' in Europe) is a [[business simulation game|business simulation video game]]. The game was designed by the German company Cybernetic Corporation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/spiele/gallery120615650/Das-sind-die-besten-deutschen-Computerspiele.html Das sind die besten deutschen Computerspiele] on [[welt.de]] "1994: Pizza Connection" (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Software 2000]] in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurogamer.de/articles/2017-01-05-pizza-connection-1-und-2-auf-gog-com-erhaeltlich pizza-connection-1-und-2-auf-gog-com-erhaeltlich] on [[Eurogamer]] by Benjamin Jakobs (05/01/2017)&lt;/ref&gt; and was published by Assemble Entertainment after its re-release in 2017. It was published and adapted for the American market by [[MicroProse]] with changed artwork and locations.

== Gameplay ==
The game is centered on being the manager of a [[pizza]] [[restaurant]] in a town in [[Europe]] or the [[United States|U.S.]]. It gives the player the option to choose among more than thirty different characters, to create one's own pizza, have cooking contests and modify the display of the restaurant and kitchen. The player can call upon local [[mafia]] to sabotage competitor restaurants or get money from criminal activities such as weapon and [[drug deal]]ing.

The game displays a playful sense of humor from the graphics and cartoonish drawings, game messages, and animated faces that are put on interacting characters. The original European version ("Pizza Connection") featured a graphical style very similar to [[MAD magazine|MAD]] artist [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]].&lt;ref name="greer"/&gt; Microprose's adapted version ("Pizza Tycoon") for the American market distanced itself from this style due to copyright concerns with newly created characters in a different style modeled after famous people as [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]] or [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].&lt;ref name="greer"&gt;[http://www.terrygreer.com/microprosemisc.html ''Terry Greer's Microprose Misc graphics page'' Page] the Microprose artist who worked on the conversion from the original German game.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Pizza Tycoon'' was followed by ''Pizza Tycoon 2'', developed by [[Software 2000]].

Both games were released on [[GOG.com]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.destructoid.com/the-delightfully-odd-pizza-tycoon-is-now-on-gog-com-409984.phtml the-delightfully-odd-pizza-tycoon-is-now-on-gog-com] on [[Destructoid]] by Jordan Devore (2017-01-05)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The [[Amiga Joker]] 2/94 magazine gave ''Pizza Connection'' 88 of 100%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&amp;id=12291&amp;s=2 Pizza Connection review] on Amiga Joker (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Powerplay magazin rated the Amiga version 82 of 100%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultpower.de/powerplay_testbericht_extern.php3?im=pizzaconnection.jpg Pizza connection] on PowerPlay (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that "Not a game for die hard action fans, but a winner for just about everyone else."&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=6|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=June 1995|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reuben Nakian''' (born August 10, 1897, [[College Point, New York]] – died December 4, 1986, [[Stamford, Connecticut]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[sculptor]] and [[teacher]] of [[Armenians|Armenian]] extraction. His recurring themes are from Greek and Roman mythology. Noted works include ''Leda and the Swan'', ''The Rape of Lucrece'', ''Hecuba'', and ''The Birth of Venus''. He was also commissioned to create portraits of Roosevelt's cabinet in the 1930s.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Reuben Nakian was born on August 10, 1897 in [[College Point, New York]]. In 1915, Nakian studied at the Independent School of Art in [[New York City]] as well as the [[Robert Henri|Robert Henri School]] with [[Homer Boss]] and [[A.S. Baylinson]]. Later he studied at the [[Art Students League of New York]] and was apprenticed to [[Paul Manship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/biography.aspx?searchtype=BIO&amp;artist=110510 Reuben Nakian biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
He met and befriended  painters  [[Arshile Gorky]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] in the 1930s and [[Marsden Hartley]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] in the 1940s. Poet [[Frank O'Hara]] was the curator of a major Reuben Nakian retrospective at New York City's [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 1966 where the artist was also exhibited in 1930. In the exhibition's catalog, O'Hara noted:

"Nakian is unrepressed, un-neurotic, unabashed in his approach to sensuality, however tortuous his esthetic commitment, and whether his subject be death, bestiality, or Arcadian dalliance. This explicitness gives the "Nymph and Satyr" plaques a marvelous joy and ease, the "Europa" terra-cottas a voluptous dignity, and the "Leda and the Swan" drawings an almost comic abandon. Unlike most sexually oriented images in modern art, from [[Auguste Rodin]] to [[Andy Warhol]], one finds no guilt or masochism in a Nakian. It is outgoing and athletic even in its releases and defeats: the satyr, the bull, the swan, the goat are each circumvented or absorbed by the goddess of his choice in the most choice of circumstances, that of his own choosing, like the amorous "dying" of the Elizabethans or the Metamorphoses of [[Ovid]]."

Later, he became close friends with composer, musician and sound designer, [[Fred Weinberg]] who said:

"Reuben and I became very close friends since we are (were) both in the arts,  lived down the street from each other and worked on our music, and art in our  Stamford, Ct. country studios. As a composer, I would make tapes of the music Reuben loved, especially Classical.. When I traveled for out of town recording sessions, I would leave my parrots, Paco and Lucy with Ruben. He loved those two parrots which he called "birdbrains". Reuben stated upon my seeing Lucy do her 'business" on one of Reuben's sculpture "Reclining Man" "Its good for the patina!.".(I have some great pics of Ruben and myself with the birds.) When I recorded with George Burns in my Stamord, Ct. studio, I introduced the two to each other, and the "Tuesday Club" began- Sort of a "secret society", where we would partake in a few drinks of Bombay Gin...Ok, more than a few.. (Ruben commented on the interesting label of Bombay Gin). One day, near his death, I found him lying  on the grass in his backyard, facing the sky  and then he winked, and told me "The Gods are  going to call me soon". Upon  Reubens death, I wrote and performed a classical piece written for Ruben called "Tribute" performed at The Stamford Library."

The '''''Review of Educational Research''''' is a bimonthly [[peer-reviewed]] [[review journal]] published by [[Sage Publications]] on behalf of the [[American Educational Research Association]]. It was established in 1931 and covers all aspects of [[education]] and [[educational research]].

== Mission Statement ==
The ''Review of Educational Research'' (''RER'') publishes critical, integrative reviews of research literature bearing on education. Such reviews should include conceptualizations, interpretations, and syntheses of literature and scholarly work in a field broadly relevant to education and educational research. ''RER'' encourages the submission of research relevant to education from any discipline, such as reviews of research in psychology, sociology, history, philosophy, political science, economics, computer science, statistics, anthropology, and biology, provided that the review bears on educational issues. ''RER'' does not publish original empirical research unless it is incorporated in a broader integrative review. ''RER'' will occasionally publish solicited, but carefully refereed, analytic reviews of special topics, particularly from disciplines infrequently represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aera.net/Publications/Journals/Review-of-Educational-Research|title=Review of Educational Research|website=www.aera.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstracting and indexing ==
The journal is abstracted and indexed in [[Academic Search Premier]], [[EBSCO Publishing|EBSCO databases]], [[Current Contents]]/Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, [[ProQuest|ProQuest Education Journals]], [[PsycINFO]], [[SafetyLit]], [[Scopus]], and the [[Social Sciences Citation Index]]. According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2017 [[impact factor]] of 8.241, ranking it first out of 238 journals in the category "Education &amp; Educational Research".&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2015 |chapter=Journals Ranked by Impact: Education &amp; Educational Research |title=2014 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Science |series=[[Web of Science]] |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12368">The [[Serbian language]] is one of the officially recognized minority languages in [[Croatia]]. It is primarily used by the [[Serbs of Croatia]]. The [[Croatian Constitution]], [[Croatian Constitutional law on national minorities rights]], [[Law on Education in language and script of national minorities]] and [[Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities]] define the public co-official usage of Serbian in Croatia. Serbian and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] are two [[standard language|standardized]] [[Variety (linguistics)#Standard varieties|varieties]] of the [[Pluricentric language|pluricentric]] [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian language]]. Majority of Serbs of Croatia use [[Ijekavian]] pronunciation of [[Proto-Slavic]] vowel [[Yat|jat]] except in the [[Podunavlje]] region in [[Vukovar-Srijem]] and [[Osijek-Baranja]] Counties where local Serb population use [[Ekavian]] pronunciation. Post-[[World War II]] and [[Croatian War of Independence]] settlers in Podunavlje which have come from [[Bosnia]], [[Dalmatia]] or Western Slavonia either use their original Ijekavian pronunciation, adopted Ekavian pronunciation or both of them depending on context. In 2011 Census majority of Serbs of Croatia declared Croatian standardized variety as their first language with Ijekavian pronunciation always being required standard form in Croatian. While Serbian variety recognizes both pronunciations as standard Ekavian is the more common one as it is the dominant one in [[Serbia]], with Ijekavian being mostly limited to [[Republika Srpska]] in Bosnia, [[Montenegro]] and Croatia.

==History==
The Orthodox [[liturgical book]] [[Varaždin Apostol]] from 1454 represents the oldest preserved text in [[Cyrillic]] from the territory of today's Croatia.&lt;ref name="biskupija"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biskupija-varazdinska.hr/OLD/Aktualno/Aktualnosti_2005/Aktualno823.htm |title=A823 |publisher=Biskupija-varazdinska.hr |date= |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian Constitutional law on national minorities rights, one of only two constitutional laws in country, entered into force on 23 December 2002.&lt;ref name="SDF-May 2007."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdf.hr/publikacije/provedba_UZPNM_na_lokalnom_nivou.pdf |title=Provedba Ustavnog zakona o pravima nacionalnih manjina u jedinicama lokalne i područne (regionalne) samouprave|accessdate=3 May 2014 |author=[[Serb Democratic Forum]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015 the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] urged the Croatian government to ensure the right of minorities to use their language and alphabet.&lt;ref name="B92-UN"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=03&amp;nav_id=93697 |title=UN calls on Croatia to ensure use of Serbian Cyrillic |format= |author = [[B92]] |date=3 April 2015  |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted the [[2013 Anti-Cyrillic protests in Croatia|use of Serbian Cyrillic in Vukovar]] and municipalities concerned.&lt;ref name="B92-UN"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian Foreign Minister [[Ivica Dačić]] said that his country welcomes the UN Human Rights Committee's report.&lt;ref name="Tanjug-UN Serbia reaction"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tanjug.rs/news/172551/serbia-welcomes-un-stance-on-use-of-cyrillic-in-croatia.htm |title = Serbia welcomes UN stance on use of Cyrillic in Croatia |format =  |author = [[Tanjug]] |date = 3 April 2015 |accessdate = 2015-04-11 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150411211332/http://www.tanjug.rs/news/172551/serbia-welcomes-un-stance-on-use-of-cyrillic-in-croatia.htm |archivedate = 11 April 2015 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serbian language education==
[[File:Škola u Trpinji.jpg|thumbnail|right|bi-lingual plate in front of the school in [[Trpinja]]]]
[[File:Dalj_Street_sign.JPG|thumbnail|right|Bilingual street sign in [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] in [[Dalj]], eastern [[Croatia]]]]
Most schools with instruction in Serbian are located in [[Vukovar-Srijem County|Vukovar-Srijem]] and [[Osijek-Baranja County]] in the area of former [[Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1995–98)|Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]] where rights on education in minority languages were provided during the [[United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium]] based on the  [[Erdut Agreement]]. Today with those schools there is also [[Kantakuzina Katarina Branković Serbian Orthodox Secondary School]] in [[Zagreb]].

In the school year 2010-2011, 3.742 students attended kindergartens, primary and secondary schools in Serbian.&lt;ref name="Prijedlog izvještaja"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/Report/PeriodicalReports/CroatiaPR5_hr.pdf | title=Peto izvješće Republike Hrvatske o primjeni Europske povelje o regionalnim ili manjinskim jezicima | date=October 2013 | author=Government of Croatia | publisher=[[Council of Europe]] | page=36 | language=hr | format=PDF | accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 59 educational institutions offered Serbian language education that year and 561 educators and teachers worked in them.&lt;ref name="Prijedlog izvještaja" /&gt; In school year 2011-2012 the total number of students was 4.059 in 63 educational institutions and 563 educators and teachers worked in them.&lt;ref name="Prijedlog izvještaja" /&gt; Number of classes or groups in this period increased from 322 to 353.&lt;ref name="Prijedlog izvještaja" /&gt;

As a chair at the Department of [[South Slavic languages]], [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]] at the [[University of Zagreb]] has a The Chair of [[Serbian literature|Serbian]] and [[Montenegrin literature]].&lt;ref name="Filozofski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffzg.unizg.hr/slaven/juzslav/en/about-the-department/the-chair-of-serbian-and-montenegrin-literature/ | title=The Chair of Serbian and Montenegrin Literature | date= | author=[[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]] | publisher=[[University of Zagreb]] | page= | language=en | format= | accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the others, lecturers of Serbian literature at the university over the time included [[Antun Barac]], [[Đuro Šurmin]] and [[Armin Pavić]].&lt;ref name="Filozofski"/&gt;

==Other forms of cultural autonomy==
Various minority organizations use Serbian in their work. One of them, [[Association for Serbian language and literature in Croatia]] from [[Vukovar]] is a nonprofit professional organization that brings together scientists and technical workers in the Republic of Croatia engaged in studying and teaching of Serbian language and literature.

==The co-official use at local government level==
The [[Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities]] provides for a mandatory co-official use of minority languages in [[municipalities of Croatia]] with at least one third of members of ethnic minoritiy. Municipalities [[Dvor, Croatia|Dvor]], [[Gvozd]], [[Jagodnjak]], [[Šodolovci]], [[Borovo, Croatia|Borovo]], [[Trpinja]], [[Markušica]], [[Negoslavci]], [[Biskupija]], [[Ervenik]], [[Kistanje]], [[Gračac]], [[Udbina]], [[Vrbovsko]], [[Donji Kukuruzari]], [[Erdut]] and [[Vukovar]], according to the provisions of law, are obliged to grant equal co-official use of Serbian language and Serbian Cyrillic alphabet. Law enforcement is facing great resistance in the part of the majority population, most notably in the case of Vukovar where it led to [[2013 Anti-Cyrillic protests in Croatia]].

'''Transparify''' is an initiative that provides a global rating of the financial transparency of major [[think tanks]].&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; It rates the extent to which think tanks publicly disclose their sources of funding, the amount of funding they have received, and the specific research projects that were supported by this funding. It is based in Georgia and has a not-for-profit status. It is funded by [[Open Society Foundations]], an organisation set up by [[George Soros]]. Its executive director is Hans Gutbrod.&lt;ref name=ft /&gt;

==Ratings==
Transparify uses a five-star ranking system. Institutions that are highly transparent about their funding receive a five star rating, whereas institutions that are 'broadly transparent' receive four stars. Three star ratings and lower are given to think tanks that are deemed to lack transparency.

===2014===
For its first round of ratings, published in May 2014, Transparify rated 169 think tanks located in 47 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Brooke|title=New Report Rates Think Tank Transparency|url=http://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/new-report-rates-think-tank-transparency|website=Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics|accessdate=12 September 2014|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From all rated institutions, 21 were given a five star rating, and another 14 were given a four star rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Transparent are Think Tanks about Who Funds Them|url=https://static.squarespace.com/static/52e1f399e4b06a94c0cdaa41/t/536a108ee4b0e77a5729562c/1399459982820/How%20Transparent%20are%20Think%20Tanks%20(Transparify%2007May2014).pdf|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015===
A second round of ratings published in 2015. Again Transparify rated 169 think tanks located in 47 countries. One of the findings was ''"Taken as a group, British think tanks drag down the European average"''.  Three organisations in the UK were deemed to be 'highly opaque'; [[LSE IDEAS]], [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] and [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]].&lt;ref name=t2015/&gt; LSE IDEAS claimed to be ''"extremely surprising"'' by its one star rating, insisting its financial details are "... available online as well as in hard copy and can easily be found on the LSE IDEAS homepage"''.&lt;ref name=ft /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6414">An '''undergraduate research journal''' is an [[academic journal]] dedicated to publishing the work of [[undergraduate]] students. Such journals have been described as important for the professionalization of students into their academic discipline and a more substantive opportunity to experience the publication and peer review process than inclusion in the acknowledgments or as one of many authors on a traditional publication.&lt;ref name="jungck"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jungck|first1=J. R.|last2=Harris|first2=M.|last3=Mercuri|first3=R.|last4=Tusin|first4=J.|title=Points of View: Should Students Be Encouraged To Publish Their Research in Student-Run Publications?: Undergraduates: Do Research, Publish!|journal=Cell Biology Education|date=1 March 2004|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24–26|doi=10.1187/cbe.04-01-0022|pmc=3197277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model has been described as well established in the United States and as a potential extension to the traditional undergraduate [[dissertation]] written by students in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walkington|first1=Helen|last2=Jenkins|first2=Alan|title=Embedding Undergraduate Research Publication in the Student Learning Experience|url=http://bejlt.brookes.ac.uk/paper/embedding_undergraduate_research_publication_in_the_student_learning_experi-2/|website=Brookes eJournal of Learning and Teaching|publisher=Oxford Brookes University|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A case study of student participation in the journal ''Reinvention: A Journal of Undergraduate Research'', found that the process challenges the "student as consumer" model of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Paul|last2=Wilding|first2=Danny|title=Rethinking the values of higher education -  the student as collaborator and producer?

==Examples==

Many [[university|universities]] maintain such journals for their own undergraduates, such as the ''Beloit Biologist'', a [[Beloit College]] publication that launched in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=Omans&gt;{{cite news|last1=Omans|first1=Nathaniel|title=The Final Steps of Your Undergraduate Research Experience: Peer Review and Publishing|url=http://blogs.plos.org/thestudentblog/2014/03/25/final-steps-undergraduate-research-experience-peer-review-publishing/|accessdate=21 April 2015|publisher=[[PLOS]] Blog|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[scholarly society|scholarly societies]] also maintain venues for the dissemination of undergraduate research, for example as special sessions at [[academic conference]]s.&lt;ref name="jungck" /&gt; Non-institutional journals may be sponsored by professional societies - for example, the [[American Institute of Physics]] published the undergraduate-peer-reviewed ''Journal of Undergraduate Research in Physics'' starting in 1981, with a temporary hiatus beginning in 2014.&lt;ref name=jurp&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal of Undergraduate Research in Physics|url=http://www.jurp.org/|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal of Young Investigators'', which has received support through science-education grants from the United States [[National Science Foundation]], the [[Burroughs Wellcome Fund]], and [[Duke University]], is managed primarily by undergraduates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal of Young Investigators|url=http://www.jyi.org|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01EFDE113AF934A25751C0A96F958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=journal+of+young+investigators&amp;st=nyt NOTEBOOK; On-Line Research Papers - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and is regarded as innovative because students are involved in [[Peer review|reviewing]] and editing papers for publication.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Alan|title=Reshaping Teaching in Higher Education: Linking Teaching with Research|date=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0749439033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations on the model may accept work from even younger students; for example, the ''Journal of Emerging Investigators'', managed by graduate students at [[Harvard University]], publishes work by [[middle school|middle-]] and [[high school|high-school-aged]] children under the guidance of a teacher or mentor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emerginginvestigators.org/about/ |title=About JEI |work=emerginginvestigators.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KelseyPasquina&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cell.com/trends/pharmacological-sciences/fulltext/S0165-6147(14)00169-2 | title=Next-generation training: publishing student scientists’ research | work=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | date=January 2015 | accessdate=13 April 2015 |author1=Kelsey, Ilana |author2=Pasquina, Lincoln }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a JEI paper gained widespread international media attention for its recommendation that the United States government save money on ink by changing official [[font]]s.&lt;ref name=APNYTimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Pa. Teen Says Typeface Change Could Save Millions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/03/28/us/ap-us-odd-typeface-saving-ink.html|accessdate=21 April 2015|agency=AP|publisher=New York Times|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The model of separate journals specifically for undergraduates has been criticized for several reasons. Such journals may not be indexed in common literature databases and publishing research in an undergraduate-only venue may make it difficult for others to find the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Siegel|first1=V.|title=Points of View: Should Students Be Encouraged To Publish Their Research in Student-Run Publications?: Weighing the Pros and Cons of Undergraduate-only Journal Publications|journal=Cell Biology Education|date=1 March 2004|volume=3|issue=1|pages=26–27|doi=10.1187/cbe.04-01-0021|pmc=3197278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have also been expressed that the process could increase stress and competitiveness in [[undergraduate research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=S. F.|title=Points of View: Should Students Be Encouraged To Publish Their Research in Student-Run Publications?: A Case Against Undergraduate-only Journal Publications|journal=Cell Biology Education|date=1 March 2004|volume=3|issue=1|pages=22–23|doi=10.1187/cbe.04-01-0023|pmc=3197276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States-India Educational Foundation''' ('''USIEF''') (formerly known as the '''United States Educational Foundation in India''') is an international foundation dedicated to [[higher education]] in India and the United States. Its primary focal points include administering the [[Fulbright Program]] to Indian and American students, faculty and professionals; encouraging international engagement of Fulbright scholars; advising students in India of higher education opportunities in the United States; and linking higher education institutions in the USA and India. In addition to administering the Fulbright-Nehru programs in India, the Foundation also administers several Fulbright grants, including the Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowships; New Century Scholars Program, Teacher Exchange Program; International Fulbright Science and Technology Award; and the Foreign Language Teaching Assistant Program.

Headquartered in [[New Delhi]], India, the Foundation was forged in 1950 as the "United States Educational Foundation in India" (USEFI) as the result of a 38-year agreement between the U.S. and India. In 2008, another agreement was signed which gave India equal partnership and modified the Foundation's name. Since May 2008, its [[executive director]] has been Adam J Grotsky. In February 2010, the Foundation celebrated its 60th Founding Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://newdelhi.usembassy.gov/pr020210b.html | title = Ambassador’s Remarks USIEF 60th Foundation Day February 2, 2010 | accessdate = 5 November 2010 | publisher = Embassy of the United States, New Delhi India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wildwood School''' is an independent progressive [[K–12|K–12 school]] located in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Wildwood was founded as an [[elementary school]] in 1971, by a group of parents led by a young lawyer named Belle Mason.&lt;ref name="wildwood.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwood.org/page.cfm?p=11|title=Wildwood School: Community Login|publisher=|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secondary campus (middle and high school) opened in 2000. The elementary campus is located in [[Los Angeles]] and the middle and upper school campus is located in West Los Angeles. There are approximately 300 students in grades K-5, the elementary campus, and 400 in grades 6-12 at the middle and upper school campus.

== Brief history ==
In the 1970s and 1980s, Wildwood School was one building on [[Olympic Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Olympic Boulevard]] in Santa Monica, where the current campus for New Roads School is located. The first graduating elementary class had only ten students. In 1991 [[Hope Boyd]], formerly the Middle School Head of [[Westlake School for Girls]], became the head of Wildwood, and the following year the elementary campus relocated to its current Culver City location.&lt;ref name="wildwood.org"/&gt; Hope Boyd began to stabilize Wildwood's academic course and solidified its reputation, and under her watch the school doubled its size. In 1999, the Board of Trustees decided to create a middle and upper school. The school was to be based on the principles of the [[Coalition of Essential Schools]] and teach project-based equitable learning. The middle and upper school opened in 2000 on Olympic Boulevard in West Los Angeles, in a small and limiting former warehouse, with no windows (which has become a subject of humor amongst Wildwood students), mercurial temperature controls, and only 100 students.&lt;ref name="wildwood.org"/&gt; [[George Wood (educator)|George Wood]], a respected national educator and [[Principal (school)|principal]] of Federal Hocking High School in Ohio, was the founding director of the secondary school. The full remodel of the middle and upper school finished in 2002.&lt;ref name="wildwood.org"/&gt;

== Philosophy ==
At the elementary school, Wildwood incorporates multi-age primary classes. For kindergarten and first grade, students learn together in "Pods". The reasoning behind this is that the older children can influence and lead the younger children, starting at a very young age. The elementary school encourages parent participation and every week during "all school meetings" parents are invited to be updated on school news and events. Multi-age continues in the middle and upper school through blended "advisories".

At the middle and upper school, students receive narrative assessments rather than letter grades. Narrative assessments are comprehensive reports written by the teacher specific to each of "The Habits of Mind and Heart". These assessments are converted into a cumulative GPA which is calculated in grades 9 through 12 to facilitate the college process. Teachers assess the students on their academic work and a set of principles known as ''The Habits of Mind and Heart''. "The Habits" are derived from a national organization known as the [[Coalition of Essential Schools]] and focus on the student as a person in addition to an academic. The academic program at Wildwood School is centered on "project-based learning". Students are assigned both short- and long-term projects throughout the year. 

The middle and upper school "Advisory" system provides a foundation for student development. Advisories composed of 12-15 students and one advisor with mixed groups of 7th and 8th graders, 9th and 10th graders, and 11th and 12th graders meet four mornings per week for one hour. Sixth grade is considered a transitional year from elementary to middle school and 6th grade advisories are composed only of 6th graders. Specific curriculum is developed for Advisory such as the school's multicultural programming, timely current world events, and programs that focus the development of the individual. Advisory also provides time for students to work on homework and to consult with teachers during consultancy periods scheduled during Advisory. Advisory also provides time for students to relax and meet with peers and teachers before the start of the school day.

Wildwood encourages a collaborative learning environment. It offers honors courses in grades 9-12 but does not offer Advanced Placement classes, nor are AP credits from other institutions recognized. Rather, Wildwood students demonstrate their [[cumulative learning]] through hour long presentations known as "Gateways" at the end of 8th and 10th grade. Students present a cumulative "Senior exhibition" at the end of 12th grade. In all middle and upper school grades, parent teacher conferences are held three times a year (twice a year during the years of gateway/exhibition) with the student's advisor. The conferences seek to address the student's academic and social development, and constitutes planning and goals for the future. Students are required to prepare for the conference by assessing their 'strengths' and 'stretches' which they then present during their conferences.

== Community involvement and internship ==
Part of the curriculum of Wildwood includes working with local social service agencies, including St. Joseph Center and the Westside Children's Center. Middle and upper school students are required to participate in these activities during school hours for 3 hours a week.

In addition, juniors and seniors must participate in the internship program for four hours a week. As a result, students receive real world job training during school hours. Many students say that the Internship program was the best part of their Wildwood experience.

Upper school students also have an opportunity to go on International Community Involvement trips during spring break. Destinations have included [[Nepal]], [[Uruguay]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Bulgaria]].

== Outreach Center ==
In 2001, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] granted Wildwood the funds to create an Outreach Center. The mission of the Outreach Center is to support the creation, development, and enhancement of small, personalized, learner-centered schools in Southern California and throughout the nation. The Center was given a huge boost in 2004, when the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] gave its public schools two years to break down into smaller schools. As a result, Wildwood's Outreach Center has held numerous professional development workshops educating public school teachers and administrators on the elements of successful small schools including, Advisory Programs, Project-Based Learning, Habits of Mind and Heart and Portfolios and Exhibitions. In addition, Wildwood School was named a Coalition of Essential Schools mentor school in 2004 - a recognition of Wildwood's work with other schools. In 2005, Wildwood received a [[National Association of Independent Schools]] Leading Edge award for the outreach work it has done with public and charter schools nationwide.

== Wildwood Athletics==
The Wildwood Wolves have middle school and high school varsity teams including: Cross Country, Girls Volleyball, Boys/Girls Basketball, Boys/Girls Soccer, Baseball, Swim, and Track and Field. The school offers other sports such as Boys/Girls Tennis, and flag football. A number of Wildwood Varsity High School teams have gone on to CIF playoffs and league championships including Boys Baseball, Boys Basketball, Girls Volleyball, and Boys Soccer. Middle school sports teams have a "no cut" policy and all students are allowed to play. At the elementary school 4th and 5th grade sports are offered. The teams all follow the "no cut" policy.

==The Institute Model==
The Wildwood Institute for STEM Research and Development (WISRD) was launched in the fall of 2014. Wildwood's Institute Model brings together students with deep passions in particular areas of academic interest. Student scholars enrolled in Institutes decide what it is they want to learn and are charged with developing their own individualized learning outcomes. Coached by Wildwood teachers and supported by outside mentors in their fields of study, students figure out how to acquire knowledge. The Institute Model is a hallmark program for teaching and learning in Wildwood's middle and upper school that provides a framework for the best ways for students to develop skills necessary for 21st-century success: Mastering content, risk-taking, problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration, and navigating uncomfortable situations with comfort. Two additional Institutes are planned: Institute for Digital Design and Entrepreneurship and the Social Good and Community Leadership Institute. In 2015, Wildwood received a matching grant in support of the Institute Model from the prestigious Edward E. Ford Foundation. 

==Wildwood Arts==
Wildwood is well known for its arts programs.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Performing Arts===
Wildwood has performed a number of [[Play (theatre)|plays]]/[[musicals]] since it opened. Students of all ages have had opportunities to act, assistant direct, stage manage, and work on technical elements such as lighting and sound design.

In addition, every spring Wildwood has a repertoire of student-directed plays, in which seniors apply to direct a one-act play of their choice. The performing arts teachers pick four of the applicants to create the repertoire. Students have also written plays in the past.

===Music===
Wildwood's music program allows students to experiment with different instruments and to compose their own work. Every year, there is a Wildwood [[Cabaret]], in which students perform music. Additional performances are held by grade level. There is also a music production class for high-school students which allows the students to learn how to use software to produce, mix, and edit music.

===Visual Arts===
Wildwood is abundant with paintings and sculptures. At the middle and upper school campus, there is a ''Gallery Space'', in which students have an opportunity to curate shows of their artwork for anyone who walks in to see.

===Electives===
In addition to the Arts, there are many other electives that high school students can take. Some of these include Technical Theater, Film making, Creative Writing, Government and Politics, and Advanced Topics in Math and Science. Wildwood offers a class that mixes Math and Science that is called STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).

[[File:ZF Campus.jpg|thumb|''ZF Campus'']]

'''Zeppelin University''' (German: ''Zeppelin Universität'', '''ZU''') is a small and highly selective&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/zeppelin-universitaet-ist-bekannt-fuer-ihr-hartes-auswahlverfahren-a-875602.html|title=Zeppelin Universität ist bekannt für ihr hartes Auswahlverfahren|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=17 April 2013|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zu.de/mediathek/video/2014/imagefilm-pioneers-wanted-auswahltag.php|title=Mediathek|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; private [[research university]] located at [[Lake Constance]] in [[Friedrichshafen]], [[Germany]]. It is named after the German general and airship constructor [[Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin]], whose foundation is the main financier of Zeppelin University.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the official status, see [http://www.hochschulkompass.de/kompass/xml/download/hs_liste.txt ''Hochschulrektorenkonferenz, Hochschulkompass''] (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The university was established in 2003 and is known for its [[avant-garde]] character as well as for a sophisticated selection. On 10. September 2011, ZU was being bestowed the right to award [[doctorate]] and [[habilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs-kompass2.de/kompass/xml/akkr/80540_17594_de.htm|title=Akkreditierte Studiengänge - Zentrale Datenbank|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes along with the right to use the title "university" (German: ''Universität'').

== Overview ==
Zeppelin University has the legal form of a non-profit, limited liability organization and calls itself "university bridging business, culture and politics". Thus it stresses the multi-disciplinary character of research and teaching that is an integral part of its self-image. The university is accredited nationally by the Academic Council of the Federal Republic of Germany ([[Wissenschaftsrat]]). The undergraduate major courses are accredited by ACQUIN, a German higher education accreditation agency.

Zeppelin University has two main campuses in [[Friedrichshafen]]: One right on the banks of [[Lake Constance]] (the ''LakeCampus'' or ''SMH'') and the nearby ''ZFCampus'' (or ''FAB3''), which was built from 2013 to 2015 to create more space for the quickly growing university. Both campuses are modern, designed by well-known architects, and contain [[classroom]]s, [[lecture hall]]s, offices, [[cafeteria]]s, a [[library]] and a wing free to use solely by students. From 2007 to 2008 (until the closure of the airport), Zeppelin University had an additional location in the foyer of [[Tempelhof International Airport]] in Berlin, the so-called “Institute for the Art of Swimming on Air”. Since 2011, there is a campus in Berlin again (''CapitalCampus'').

There are several [[student group]]s and projects, such as groups affiliated with political parties (''LHG, Jusos, RCDS''), a debating club (''Soapbox''), the Club of International Politics (''CIP''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.international-politics.org/|title=CIP|website=CIP|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Model United Nations group (MUN), which also organizes ''LakeMun'', entrepreneurial groups, a cultural club which also organizes a music festival at the university (''SeeKult''), a student medical service, a filming group, several bands and many more - some of them are even known nationwide (e.g. ''RockYourLife''). In 2008, the student radio station ''Welle20'' went on air.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/das-studium/studentische-projekte.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection==
Applicants are selected by the university in an arduous two-step selection process: after a detailed written application, in which the first selection is made, the most auspicious candidates will be invited to an [[assessment centre|assessment day]] (''Pioneers Wanted''). Thereby, the candidates undergo a program consisting of several interviews with professors, students, [[alumni]], and external reviewers, as well as written tests. Furthermore, they have to accomplish a realistic project which is introduced by an associated organisation, whereby a problem has to be solved as a group and must be presented afterwards in front of the assessment committee.&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/bewerbung-bachelor/bewerbung.php Application]&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection procedure of ZU is being considered as outstandingly sophisticated, also because of its deviating modalities compared to other universities: ZU deliberately refrain from the solely use of a [[numerus clausus]] (which is widely prevalent in German educational landscape), but instead tries to find personalities which - besides accomplishing the required performance - also fit to the university's character.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; Therefore, the university currently has an undergraduate acceptance rate, which is lower than 10% and a graduate acceptance rate of about 16%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeppelin-university.de/deutsch/zeppelinuniversity/facts_figures.php?navid=8|title=zu in zahlen|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==
Students can graduate with the academic degree of a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A. with 240 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]) and a consecutive, as well as a non-consecutive, [[Master of Arts]] or [[Master of Science]] (M.A. / M.Sc. with 120 ECTS).

The university offers Bachelor courses in the field of [[Liberal arts education]]. Programs of Study are offered in:
* B.A. [[Sociology]], [[Political Science|Politics]] and [[Economics]] (SPE)
* B.A. [[Business administration|Corporate Management]] &amp; [[Economics]] (CME)
* B.A. [[Communication Science|Communication]] &amp; [[Cultural studies|Cultural Management]] (CCM) and
* B.A. [[Political Science|Politics]], [[Public administration|Administration]] &amp; [[International Relations]] (PAIR).&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/ba-studium.php Bachelor-Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are Master programs in:
* M.Sc. Corporate Management &amp; Economics (CME)
* M.A. General Management (GEMA)
* M.A. Pioneering in Arts, Media &amp; the Creative Industries (AMC) and
* M.A. Politics, Administration &amp; International Relations (PAIR).&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/ma-studium.php Master-Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the university offers several Executive Master programs (E.M.A.) in:
* E.M.A. Family Entrepreneurship (FESH)
* E.M.A. Digital Pioneering (DIP) and
* E.M.A. Business &amp; Leadership for Engineers and Mobility Innovations (BEL).&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/weiterbildung/index.php?navid=880908880908 Weiterbildungs-Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tuition]] for the bachelor program amounts to 3,950.00 euro per semester or 675.00 euro per month, for the master programs from 4,000.00 euro to 4,900.00 euro per semester.&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [http://www.zu.de/deutsch/bewerberportal/bachelor/2010/gebuehren_BA_CME.php Tuition]&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous merit-based [[scholarship]]s by foundations and patrons as well as a student loan of ''[[Sparkasse]] Bodensee'' that is offered at a relatively low interest rate and is used by more than half of the students.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.brandeins.de/archiv/2005/freiheit/am-strand-der-guten-hoffnung.html Am Strand der guten Hoffnung]'', in: [[brand eins]], January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from Fall Semester 2011, Zeppelin University reorganized all of their undergraduate degree programmes, converting them into 4-year programs. The additional year is intended to be used as "Humboldt-year", a one-year research project at one of the partner universities. Accordingly, it has cooperation agreements for example with [[University of California]], Berkeley, with [[Sciences Po]] in Paris, with [[Copenhagen Business School]] as well as with [[Goldsmiths College]], London.&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [http://www.zu.de/deutsch/bewerberportal/bachelor/ZU_Bachelorbroschuere_05_2011.pdf Info-brochure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217023856/http://www.zu.de/deutsch/bewerberportal/bachelor/ZU_Bachelorbroschuere_05_2011.pdf |date=February 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rankings==
Zeppelin University is a small and exclusive&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; private university and offers fewer programs than traditional universities in Germany. Due to its young age and small size, it typically goes unranked in international comparisons. Nevertheless, it has reached remarkable results in German Rankings: In the magazine ''Handelsblatt Karriere'', edition 07/08 dated April 27, 2007, Zeppelin University has appeared in a university ranking for the first time. It has instantly reached eighth place with its economic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idw-online.de/pages/en/news?id=206668|title=Zeppelin University unter den Top 10 der deutschen Unis|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most reputable German Ranking, the ''CHE University Ranking'', which was published by ''ZEIT Studienführer'' 2014/15, the university was able to reach the first place with “Corporate Management &amp; Economics” (CME), while [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/pair/index.php?navid=538739538739 Politics, Administration &amp; International Relations (PAIR)] was ranked among the three best Political Science programs. In 2011/12 the Communication &amp; Cultural Management program was ranked first place by ''CHE''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zu.de/universitaet/rankings.php|title=Rankings|website=www.zu.de|language=de|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sociology, Politics, and Economics degree is not ranked, due to its multidisciplinarity.

In 2014, the university was listed in an international ranking for the first time: in the ''U-Multirank'' it gained the best grade "excellent".
