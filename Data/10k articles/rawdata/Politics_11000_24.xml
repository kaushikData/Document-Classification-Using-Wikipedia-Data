'''Operation Amalgam Virgo''' is a [[CINCNORAD]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/ex-northcom.htm |title=Exercises - NORAD / Northern Command |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; joint task counter-terrorist and field training exercise (FTX) carried out in Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida on early June 2001. [[NORAD]] sponsored the multi-agency planning exercise involving the hypothetical scenario of a [[cruise missile]] or [[UAV]] launched by a terrorist group.&lt;ref&gt;Quote: TERRORIST GROUP ACQUIRES CM'S/UAV'S (page 17, pdf file)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osama bin Laden]] was pictured on the cover of the proposal for the exercise. Key military players involved in the exercise also included personnel from the 1st Air Force battalion, the U.S. National Guard, the U.S. Reserve forces, and the U.S. Navy.

Several naval ships including the [[USS Yorktown (CG-48)|USS ''Yorktown'']] and the Navy Aegis cruiser were dispatched to the Gulf of Mexico as part of the multi-service anti-cruise missile operation. Military land personnel from the 1st Air Force also engaged in gathering radar information on low-level targets by using the Joint-Based Expeditionary Connectivity Center (JBECC), a mobile shelter capable of being deployed to high-risk regions while providing early warning signals on cruise missile attacks.

'''Aspies For Freedom''' ('''AFF''') is a solidarity and campaigning group that aimed at raising public awareness of the [[autism rights movement]].  The aim of Aspies For Freedom is to educate the public that the autism spectrum is not always a [[disability]], and that there are advantages as well as disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9RrshCudnIAC&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=%22aspies%20for%20freedom%22&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q=%22aspies%20for%20freedom%22&amp;f=false|title=Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Reference Handbook|last=Bernier|first=Raphael|last2=Gerdts|first2=Jennifer|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|isbn=9781598843347|location=|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose, the group organizes an annual [[Autistic Pride Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Autistic Licence |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,589-1960650,00.html |work=Times Online |date=31 December 2005 |accessdate=8 November 2007 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103050400/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C589-1960650%2C00.html |archivedate=January 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; AFF provides support for the autistic community and protests attempts to cure autism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Established in 2004 by Amy and Gareth Nelson, AFF has received coverage from publications such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Trivedi |first=Bijal |title=Autistic and proud of it |date=18 June 2005 |work=New Scientist |location= London |url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18625041.500.html |accessdate=8 November 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070815184818/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18625041.500.html |archivedate= 15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' estimated the group's membership at 20,000.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/aug/07/health.medicineandhealth|title=G2: 'It is not a disease, it is a way of life'|last=Saner|first=Emine|date=12 August 2007|work=The Guardian|location=London|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Crossan, writing for the BBC, mentioned their belief that higher functioning autistics are often in possession of extraordinary talents in the fields of mathematics, memory, music or arts.&lt;ref name="OuchAspies"&gt;{{cite web |last=Crossan |first=Rob|title=Ouch Q&amp;A #19: Aspies |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/fact/ouch_q_a_19_aspies.shtml |work=Ouch!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6483">The '''Assimilative Crimes Act''', {{UnitedStatesCode|18|13}}, makes [[State law (United States)|state law]] applicable to conduct occurring on lands reserved or acquired by the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] as provided in {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|7|3}}, when the act or omission is not made punishable by an enactment of [[United States Congress|Congress]].

==History==
The first Assimilative Crimes Act was passed as § 3 of the [[Crimes Act of 1825]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Crimes Act of 1825]], ch. 65, § 3, 4 Stat. 115, 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and interpretation==
Prosecutions instituted under this statute are not to enforce the laws of the state, but to enforce Federal law, the details of which, instead of being recited, are adopted by reference. In addition to minor violations, the statute has been invoked to cover a number of serious criminal offenses defined by state law such as [[burglary]] and [[embezzlement]]. However, the Assimilative Crimes Act cannot be used to override other Federal policies as expressed by acts of Congress or by valid administrative orders.

The prospective incorporation of state law was upheld in ''United States v. Sharpnack'', 355 U.S. 286 (1957). State law is assimilated only when no "enactment of Congress" covers the conduct. The application of this rule is not always easy. In ''Williams v. United States'', 327 U.S. 711, 717 (1946), prosecution of a sex offense under a state statute with a higher age of consent was held impermissible, but a conviction for a shooting with intent to kill as defined by state law was upheld, despite the similarity of provisions of {{UnitedStatesCode|18|113}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Fields v. United States'', 438 F.2d 205 (2d Cir.), ''cert. denied'', 403 U.S. 907 (1971); but see ''Hockenberry v. United States'', 422 F.2d 171 (9th Cir. 1970). See also ''United States v. Bowers'', 660 F.2d 527 (5th Cir. 1981) (child abuse); ''United States v. Smith'', 574 F.2d 988 (9th Cir. 1978)(sodomy).&lt;/ref&gt; There seems to be a definite trend to construe 18 U.S.C. § 13 liberally to provide complete coverage of criminal conduct within a [[federal enclave]], even where the offense is generally covered by Federal law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''United States v. Johnson'', 967 F.2d 1431 (10th Cir. 1992)(aggravated assault); ''United States v. Griffith'', 864 F.2d 421 (6th Cir. 1988)(reckless assault); ''United States v. Kaufman'', 862 F.2d 236 (9th Cir. 1988)(assault); ''Fesler v. United States'', 781 F.2d 384 (5th Cir.), ''cert. denied'', 476 U.S. 1118 (1986)(child abuse).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to military law==
The [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (U.C.M.J.), 10 U.S.C. § 801 et seq., because of its unlimited applicability, is not considered an "enactment of Congress" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 13.&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Walker'', 552 F.2d 566 (4th Cir. 1977), ''cert. denied'', 434 U.S. 848 (1977) (drunk driving). See also ''Franklin v. United States'', 216 U.S. 559 (1910).&lt;/ref&gt; Military personnel committing acts on an enclave subject to Federal jurisdiction which are not made an offense by Federal statutes other than the U.C.M.J. may therefore be prosecuted in district court for violations of state law assimilated by 18 U.S.C. § 13, even though they are also subject to [[Courts-martial in the United States|court martial]]. However, dual prosecution, it should be noted, is constitutionally precluded by the [[Double Jeopardy Clause]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Grafton v. United States'', 206 U.S. 333 (1907).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to administrative law==
18 U.S.C. § 13 does not assimilate penal provisions of state regulatory schemes.&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Marcyes'', 557 F.2d 1361 (9th Cir. 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Nor does it incorporate state administrative penalties, such as suspension of [[driver's license]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Rowe'', 599 F.2d 1319 (4th Cir. 1979); ''United States v. Best'', 573 F.2d 1095 (9th Cir. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Section 13(b) allows suspension of licenses within the enclave.

[[United States administrative law|Federal agency regulations]], violations of which are made criminal by statute, have been held to preclude assimilation of state law.&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Adams'', 502 F. Supp. 21 (S.D.Fla. 1980)(carrying concealed weapon in federal courthouse); ''United States v. Woods'', 450 F. Supp. 1335 (D.Md. 1978)(drunken driving on parkway).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''United States v. Adams'', 502 F. Supp. 21, the defendant was charged with carrying a concealed weapon in a United States Courthouse in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 13 and the pertinent [[Florida]] felony firearms statute. In dismissing the indictment, the ''Adams'' court concluded that a [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) petty offense weapons regulation, which had explicitly provided for by statute, amounted to an enactment of Congress within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 13 and, therefore, the defendant could not be prosecuted by the assimilation of state law which prohibited the same precise act.

It is important to note, however, that a critical provision of the GSA regulations apparently was not considered in ''Adams''. The regulation at the time of the case provides in part: "Nothing in these rules and regulations shall be construed to abrogate any other Federal laws or regulations or any State and local laws and regulations applicable to any area in which the property is situated."

This non-abrogation provision arguably would permit the assimilation of appropriate state firearms laws or other state statutes notwithstanding the existence of the GSA regulations. It appears that this language has never been considered in any reported case. Moreover, no discussion of the meaning of this language appears in the pertinent parts of the [[Federal Register]].&lt;ref&gt;43 Fed.Reg. 29001, July 5, 1978; 41 Fed.Reg. 13378, March 30, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice]] believe it would be reasonable to interpret this non-abrogation provision as permitting the government, in its discretion, to proceed under 18 U.S.C. § 13 and appropriate state firearms laws, rather than under the GSA weapons regulation.

The '''Asturian miners' strike of 1934''' was a major [[strike action]], against the entry of the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] (CEDA) into the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish government]] on October 6,&lt;ref&gt;Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p.61, University of Notre Dame Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; which took place in [[Asturias]] in northern [[Spain]], that developed into a revolutionary uprising. It was crushed by the [[Spanish Navy]] and the [[Spanish Republican Army]], the latter using mainly Moorish troops from [[Spanish Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;The Splintering of Spain, p.54 CUP, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Franco]] controlled the movement of the troops, aircraft, warships and [[armoured train]]s used in the crushing of the revolution. Visiting [[Oviedo]] after the rebellion had been put down he said; "this war is a frontier war and its fronts are socialism, communism and whatever attacks civilization in order to replace it with barbarism."&lt;ref&gt;Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p.62&lt;/ref&gt; Though the forces sent to the north by Franco consisted of the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]] and the Moroccan colonial troops known as [[Regulares]], the right-wing press portrayed the Asturian rebels in xenophobic and [[anti-Semitic]] terms as the lackeys of a foreign [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish-Bolshevik]] conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Balfour, Deadly Embrace:Morocco and the Road to the Spanish Civil War, 252-254 OUP 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following the victory of the parties of the right in the general election of 1933, the new government, led by [[Alejandro Lerroux]], met stiff resistance from the leftist parties. As a result, the [[anarchist]]s and [[socialist]]s called a [[general strike]]. However the strike immediately exposed differences on the left between the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) linked [[Unión General de Trabajadores]] (UGT), which organised the strike and the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[trade union]], the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT), which was sceptical of the value of strike action as a political tactic.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} As a result, the strike failed in much of [[Spain]]. A "Catalan republic" lasted just ten hours, and  despite an attempt at a general stoppage in [[Madrid]], other strikes did not endure and [[Asturias]] was left to fight alone.&lt;ref&gt;Spain 1833-2002, p.133, Mary Vincent,  Oxford, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==The strike==
[[File:Localización de Asturias.svg|thumb|right|300px|Location of Asturias within Spain]]
In several mining towns in Asturias, local unions gathered small arms and were determined to see the strike through. The strike began on the evening of October 4, with the miners occupying several towns, attacking and seizing local [[Guardia Civil|Civil]] and [[Assault Guard]] barracks.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Gabriel. ''The Spanish Republic and the Civil War,1931-1939.'' Princeton University Press. Princeton. 1967. pp.154-155&lt;/ref&gt; The following day saw columns of miners advancing along the road to [[Oviedo]], the provincial capital. With the exception of two barracks where fighting with the garrison of 1,500 government troops continued, the city was taken by October 6. The miners proceeded to occupy several other towns, most notably the large industrial centre of [[La Felguera]], and set up town assemblies or 'revolutionary committees', to govern towns they controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. 2001. London. p.131&lt;/ref&gt; 

The revolutionary soviets set up by the miners attempted to impose order on the areas under their control and the moderate socialist leadership of [[Ramón González Peña]] and Balamino Tomas took measures to restrain violence. However a number of captured priests, businessmen and civil guards were executed in   [[Mieres, Asturias|Mieres]] and [[Sama, Asturias|Sama]], while churches, convents and part of the university at Oviedo were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh, p132 ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. 2001, {{ISBN|0-141-01161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The government in Madrid now called on two of its senior generals [[Manuel Goded]] and [[Francisco Franco]] to co-ordinate suppression of what had become a major rebellion. Goded and Franco recommended that regular units of colonial troops from [[Spanish Morocco]] be used instead of the inexperienced conscripts of the Peninsular Army. The Minister of War [[Diego Hidalgo y Durán|Diego Hidalgo]] agreed that the latter would be at a disadvantage in combat against the well organized miners, who were skilled in the use of dynamite.

Columns of Civil Guards, Moroccan [[Regulares]] and the [[Spanish Legion]] were accordingly organized under General [[Eduardo López Ochoa]] and Colonel [[Juan Yagüe|Juan de Yague]] to relieve the besieged government garrisons and to retake the towns from the miners. These troops were carried on the CNT-controlled railways to Asturias without resistance by the anarchists. During the operations, an [[autogyro]] made a reconnaissance flight for the government troops, in what was the first military employment of a [[rotorcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G. (1993). ''Spain's first democracy: the Second Republic, 1931–1936''. Univ of Wisconsin Press, p. 219. {{ISBN|0-299-13674-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 7, delegates from the anarchist-controlled seaport towns of [[Gijón]] and [[Avilés]] arrived in Oviedo to request weapons to defend against a landing of government troops. Ignored by the socialist UGT-controlled committee, the delegates returned to their town empty-handed and government troops met little resistance as they recaptured Gijón and Avilés the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Gabriel.

==Aftermath==
In the armed action taken against the uprising, some 3,000 miners were killed in the fighting, with another 30,000&lt;ref name="Thomas, Hugh 2001. p.136"&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. 2001. London. p.136&lt;/ref&gt;–40,000 taken prisoner,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Gabriel. ''The Spanish Republic and the Civil War, 1931-1939.'' Princeton University Press. Princeton. 1967. p.161&lt;/ref&gt; and thousands more sacked from their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939.'' Penguin Books. 2006. London. p.32&lt;/ref&gt; The repression of the uprising carried out by the [[Spanish Legion|colonial troops]] was very harsh, including looting, rape and summary executions.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. The battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939. Penguin Books. 2006. London. pp.31-32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Gabriel. ''The Spanish Republic and the Civil War, 1931-1939.'' Princeton University Press. Princeton. 1967. pp.159-160&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]], 2,000 persons died in the uprising: 230-260 military and police, 33 priests, 1,500 miners in combat and 200 individuals killed in the repression (among them the journalist Luis de Sirval, who pointed out tortures and executions and was arrested and killed by three officers of the [[Spanish Legion|Legion]]).&lt;ref name="Thomas, Hugh 2001. p.136"/&gt; The government suspended Constitutional guarantees.  Almost all the left's newspapers were closed, as they were owned by the parties which promoted the uprising.  Hundreds of town councils&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Helen. ''The Spanish Civil War. A very short introduction.'' Oxford University Press. 2005. p.16&lt;/ref&gt; and mixed juries were suspended.  Torture in prisons was widespread, as it was during all the Republic's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Gabriel. ''The Spanish Republic and the Civil War,1931-1939.'' Princeton University Press. Princeton. 1967. p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

Franco was convinced that the workers uprising had been "carefully prepared by the agents of Moscow". Fed by material he gathered from the Entente Anticommuniste of Geneva, Franco believed that he was justified in the brutal use of troops against Spanish civilians. Historian [[Paul Preston]]: "Unmoved by the fact that the central symbol of rightist values was the [[Reconquista|reconquest of Spain from the Moors]], Franco did not hesitate to ship Moorish mercenaries to fight in Asturias, the only part of Spain where the [[crescent]] had never flown.  He saw no contradiction about using the Moors, because he regarded left-wing workers with the same racialist contempt he  possessed towards the tribesmen of the [[Rif]]."&lt;ref&gt;Unearthing Franco's Legacy,  pp61-62&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bert Willis Karlsson''' (born 21 June 1945, in [[Skövde]], [[Västra Götaland County]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[record company]] manager, [[entrepreneur]], former [[politician]] ([[Member of Parliament]] 1991-1994) and front figure of the [[New Democracy (Sweden)|New Democracy]] (''Ny Demokrati'') party. 

As the owner and manager of the record company [[Mariann Grammofon AB]], Karlsson became a familiar face to the Swedish public as the man behind [[Carola Häggkvist]]. In 1984 he started [[Skara Sommarland]], a theme park. 

In 1991, Karlsson and count [[Ian Wachtmeister]] started the [[populism|populist]] political party ''[[Ny Demokrati|New Democracy]]''. Attracting major media attention, and with a patriotic platform, the party received 6.7 percent of the vote in the [[Swedish parliamentary election, 1991|parliamentary election]] in September. With no previous political experience, Karlsson suddenly found himself elected to the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] as a [[Member of Parliament]].

When ''New Democracy'' imploded due to internal struggles and failed in the [[Swedish parliamentary election, 1994|1994 parliamentary election]] Karlsson went back to being a full-time businessman. He has started the popular Swedish [[reality television]] show [[Fame Factory]], (a programme somewhat similar to the British show [[Pop Idol]]), in which he played an important role. Many Mariann artists have entered [[Melodifestivalen]], the Swedish qualifications for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. From 1978 to 2005, approximately 120 songs from Karlsson's record company competed, and 14 of these went on to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song contest. Mariann artists include [[Herreys]] and [[Charlotte Perrelli]], who went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1984|1984]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]], respectively).

In March 2005, Karlsson filled out an application for membership in the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]] during a television interview. When the party immediately responded with criticism of him, calling the move a media stunt, he did not go through with his application.

Karlsson was a judge in the first five seasons of the TV show "[[Talang Sverige|Talang]]" on [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]], the Swedish version of [[America's Got Talent]], between 2007–2011.

The '''Billion Oyster Project''' is a [[citizen science]] project co-ordinated by the [[New York Harbor School]] with the goal of restoring one billion live oysters to [[New York Harbor]] by 2030. The project aims to engage hundreds of thousands of school children during its lifetime in marine restoration-based [[STEM fields#Education|STEM education programs]]. The project grew out of the activities of students at the New York Harbor School who started growing and restoring oysters in New York Harbor in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billionoysterproject.org/about/ |title=Billion Oyster Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
The project was inspired by the success of the Oyster Recovery Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oysterrecovery.org/|title=Oyster Recovery Project|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Chesapeake Bay]] which has to date replanted more than 5.2 billion oysters on 1,600 acres of oyster reefs. Oyster reefs are thought to have covered more than 220,000 acres of the [[Hudson River]] estuary and filtered water, provided habitat for other marine species and attenuated wave energy but are now functionally extinct in the Harbor due to overharvesting, dredging and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/restaurants/a-billion-oysters-tell-the-history-of-new-york-7212289 |author=Karen Tedesco |title=A BILLION OYSTERS TELL THE HISTORY OF NEW YORK|publisher=Village Voice| date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The project was the brainchild of educators Murray Fisher and Peter Malinowski who are both associated with New York Harbor School and its Foundation and was formally established in 2014. A $5 million [[National Science Foundation]] grant will allow the program to spread to thousands of public middle school students from 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20141030/south-street-seaport/billion-oysters-project-5m-grant-used-build-new-marine-based-curriculum |author=Sybile Penhirin |title=Billion Oysters Project $5M Grant |publisher=DNAinfoNY |date=October 30, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231143/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20141030/south-street-seaport/billion-oysters-project-5m-grant-used-build-new-marine-based-curriculum |archivedate=September 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achievements ===

By August 2015, 11.5 million oysters had been grown in NY Harbor, with 1.05 acres of reef area restored. More than 2,150 high school students and 875 middle school students have taken part in the project. Approximately 93,600 pounds of oyster shell have been recycled. Co-ordinators estimate the oysters have filtered approximately 10.9 trillion gallons of water in New York Harbor, removing 6.75 million pounds of nitrogen.

[[Image:Catostconspirators.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The arrest of the Cato Street conspirators.]]
The '''Cato Street Conspiracy''' was an attempt to murder all the British cabinet ministers and Prime Minister [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] in 1820. The name comes from the meeting place near [[Edgware Road, London|Edgware Road]] in London. The police had an informer and the plotters fell into a police trap and 13 were arrested, while one policeman was killed. Five conspirators were executed, and five others were [[Convicts in Australia|transported to Australia]]. 

How widespread the Cato Street conspiracy was is uncertain. It was a time of unrest; rumours abounded.&lt;ref&gt;Elie Halevy, ''The Liberal Awakening 1815–1930'' [A History of the English People In The Nineteenth Century - vol. II] (1949), pp. 80–84.&lt;/ref&gt;  Malcolm Chase noted that, "the London-Irish community and a number of trade societies, notably shoemakers, were prepared to lend support, while unrest and awareness of a planned rising were widespread in the industrial north and on Clydeside."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Chase, "Thistlewood, Arthur (bap. 1774, d. 1820)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
[[File:Cato Street Conspiracy - 1a Cato Street Marylebone London W1H 5HG.jpg|thumb|left|The London building where the conspirators were discovered which is today marked by a [[blue plaque]]]]
The conspirators were called the Spencean Philanthropists, a group taking their name from the British radical speaker [[Thomas Spence]]. The group was known for being a revolutionary organization, involved in unrest and propaganda and plotting the overthrow of the government.

Some of them, particularly [[Arthur Thistlewood]], had been involved with the [[Spa Fields riots]] in 1816. Thistlewood came to dominate the group with George Edwards as his second in command.  Edwards was a police spy. Most of the members were angered by the [[Six Acts]] and the [[Peterloo Massacre]], as well as with the economic depression and political repression of the time. 

The conspirators planned to assassinate the cabinet which was supposed to be together at a dinner. They would then seize key buildings, overthrow the government and establish a "Committee of Public Safety" to oversee a radical revolution. According to the prosecution at their trial, they had intended to form a provisional government headquartered in the [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Smith, "Arthur Thistlewood: A 'Regency Republican'." ''History Today'' 3 (1953): 846–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hard economic times encouraged social unrest.  The end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 further worsened the economy and saw the return of job-seeking veterans. [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]'s death on 29 January 1820, created a new governmental crisis. In a meeting held on 22 February, George Edwards suggested that the group could exploit the political situation and kill all the cabinet ministers after invading the fictitious cabinet dinner at the home of [[Dudley Ryder, 1st Earl of Harrowby|Lord Harrowby]], [[Lord President of the Council]], armed with pistols and [[Hand grenade#Europe|grenades]]. Edwards even provided funds to help arm the conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., in a letter delivered to Lord Harrowby on the day of execution, conspirator William Davidson stated that "Mr Edwards was the man who gave me the money to redeem the blunderbuss, which Adams carried away to Cato-street". ''Morning Chronicle'', 2 May 1820, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thistlewood thought the act would trigger a massive uprising against the government. James Ings, a coffeeshop keeper and former [[butcher]], later announced that he would have decapitated all the cabinet members and taken two heads to exhibit on [[Westminster Bridge]]. Thistlewood spent the next hours trying to recruit more men for the attack. Twenty-seven men joined the effort.

== Discovery ==
When Jamaican-born [[William Davidson (conspirator)|William Davidson]], who had worked for Lord Harrowby, went to find more details about the cabinet dinner, a servant in Lord Harrowby's house told him that his master was not at home. When Davidson told this to Thistlewood, he refused to believe it and demanded that the operation commence at once. John Harrison rented a small house in Cato Street as the base of operations. However, Edwards kept the police fully informed. Some of the other members had suspected Edwards but Thistlewood had made him his top aide.  

Edwards had presented the idea with the full knowledge of the Home Office, who had also put the advertisement about the supposed dinner in ''The New Times''. When he reported that his would-be-comrades would be ready to follow his suggestion, the Home Office decided to act.

== Arrest ==
[[File:Execution of the Cato St Conspirators.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The execution of the Cato Street conspirators, 1 May 1820]]
On 23 February, [[Richard Birnie]], [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court|Bow Street]] magistrate, and George Ruthven, another police spy, went to wait at a public house on the other side of the street of the Cato Street building with twelve officers of the [[Bow Street Runners]]. Birnie and Ruthven waited for the afternoon because they had been promised reinforcements from the [[Coldstream Guards]], under the command of [[Lord Frederick FitzClarence|Captain FitzClarence]], an illegitimate son of the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence (later William IV)]]. Thistlewood's group arrived during that time. At 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm, the [[Bow Street Runners]] decided to apprehend the conspirators themselves. 

In the resulting brawl, Thistlewood killed a police officer with a sword. Some conspirators surrendered peacefully, while others resisted forcefully. William Davidson was captured while Thistlewood, Robert Adams, John Brunt and John Harrison slipped out through the back window but they were arrested a few days later.

== Charges ==

''"1. Conspiring to devise plans to subvert the Constitution. 2. Conspiring to levy war, and subvert the Constitution. 3. Conspiring to murder divers of the Privy Council. 4. Providing arms to murder divers of the Privy Council. 5. Providing arms and ammunition to levy war and subvert the Constitution. 6. Conspiring to seize cannon, arms and ammunition to arm themselves, and to levy war and subvert the Constitution. 7. Conspiring to burn houses and barracks, and to provide combustibles for that purpose. 8. Preparing addresses, &amp;c. containing incitements to the King's subjects to assist in levying war and subverting the Constitution. 9. Preparing an address to the King's subjects, containing therein that their tyrants were destroyed, &amp;c., to incite them to assist in levying war, and in subverting the Constitution. 10. Assembling themselves with arms, with intent to murder divers of the Privy Council, and to levy war, and subvert the Constitution. 11. Levying war."'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18200416-1&amp;div=t18200416-1 Court decision]. The Proceedings of the Old Bailey.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial and executions ==
[[Image:A May Day Garland for 1820.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Print from May 1820 showing establishment figures dancing around a [[maypole]] (a reference to the date of the conspirators' execution, [[May Day]] 1820).  On top of the maypole are the heads of:&lt;br&gt;John Thomas Brunt (1782–1820);&lt;br&gt;[[William Davidson (conspirator)|William Davidson]] (1781–1820);&lt;br&gt;James Ings (1794–1820);&lt;br&gt;[[Arthur Thistlewood]] (1774–1820);&lt;br&gt;and, Richard Tidd (1773–1820).]]
During the trial, the defence argued that the statement of Edwards, a government spy, was unreliable and he was therefore never called to testify. Police persuaded two of the men, Robert Adams and John Monument, to testify against other conspirators in exchange for dropped charges.  On 28 April most of the accused were sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] for [[high treason]]. All sentences were later commuted, at least in respect of this medieval form of execution, to hanging and beheading. The death sentences of Charles Cooper, Richard Bradburn, John Harrison, James Wilson and John Strange were commuted to [[penal transportation|transportation]] for life.

Arthur Thistlewood, Richard Tidd, James Ings, William Davidson and John Brunt were [[hanging|hanged]] at [[Newgate Prison]] on the morning of 1 May 1820 in front of a crowd of many thousands, some having paid as much as three guineas for a good vantage point from the windows of houses overlooking the scaffold.&lt;ref name="morningchronicle02May1820" /&gt; Infantry were stationed nearby, out of sight of the crowd, two [[troop]]s of [[Life Guards (United Kingdom)|Life Guards]] were present, and eight artillery pieces were deployed commanding the road at [[Blackfriars Bridge]].&lt;ref name=times2may/&gt; Large banners had been prepared with a painted order to disperse. These were to be displayed to the crowd if trouble caused the authorities to invoke the [[Riot Act]].&lt;ref name="morningchronicle02May1820" /&gt; However, the behaviour of the multitude was "peaceable in the extreme".&lt;ref name=times2may&gt;"Execution of Thistlewood, &amp;c", ''[[The Times]]'' 2 May 1820, p. 3. Accessed at The Times Digital Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The hangman was [[John Foxton]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Richard, [http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/newgate.html "A history of London's Newgate prison"] at capitalpunishmentuk.org&lt;/ref&gt; After the bodies had hung for half an hour, they were lowered one at a time and an unidentified individual in a black mask decapitated them against an angled block with a small knife. Each beheading was accompanied by shouts, booing and hissing from the crowd and each head was displayed to the assembled spectators, declaring it to be the head of a traitor, before placing it in the coffin with the remainder of the body.&lt;ref name="morningchronicle02May1820"&gt;{{cite news | title=Execution of Thistlewood and Others for High Treason | work=The Morning Chronicle | date=2 May 1820 | location=London | issue=15915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The British government used the incident to justify the [[Six Acts]] that had been passed two months prior. However, in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], [[Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet|Matthew Wood]] MP accused the government of purposeful entrapment of the conspirators to smear the campaign for parliamentary reform. The otherwise pro-government newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' ignored the order of the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] Sir [[Charles Abbott, 1st Baron Tenterden|Charles Abbott]] not to report the trial before the sentencing.

The conspiracy is the subject of many books, as well as one play, ''[[Cato Street]]'', written by the actor and author [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]. The conspiracy was also the basis for a 2001 radio drama, ''Betrayal: The Trial of William Davidson'' by [[Tanika Gupta]], on [[BBC Radio 4]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], '''community empowerment networks''' (CENs) are networks of a collection of local community, voluntary and third sector organisations and groups, set up by the central government as part of an initiative to foster community involvement in regeneration at a local level.  They get together periodically to discuss issues of concern to them in relation to regeneration plans. CENs exist locally across the UK. A CEN forms an important but small part of a [[Local Strategic Partnership]].

Statement from the [[Improvement and Development Agency]]'s Website [http://www.idea.gov.uk/idk/core/page.do?pageId=1092347 idea statement]:
{{quotation|As a crucial part of the Government’s drive to reduce the gap between England’s poorest communities and the country as a whole, the ‘National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal’ published in 2001, seeks to influence change at a local level.

The Neighbourhood Renewal Fund provides a grant to 88 of the most deprived local authority areas to fund the work of Local Strategic Partnerships (LSPs) in improving services and targeting resources more effectively.

Since 2001, £43 million a year has been invested in developing community empowerment networks through the Single Community Programme in order to foster community involvement in neighbourhood renewal initiatives. To date, these networks have funded 25,000 community projects, provided the LSPs with access to a wider community network and led community development work.}}

'''Community owned''' assets or organisations are those that are owned and controlled through some [[lobbying|representative]] mechanism that allows a community to influence their operation or use and to enjoy the benefits arising.

Benefits of  ownership in [[infrastructure]] projects such as dams and irrigation are claimed to include increased responsiveness to needs of that community and the community valuing the projects more highly.

==Community land buyouts==
Communities can sometimes buy the land they live on and manage them through locally-run trusts. There are many examples of this in [[Scotland]] including [[Eigg]], [[Assynt]] and potentially [[Ulva]].

==Community owned enterprises==

In [[Saranac Lake, New York]], after the local [[Ames Department Stores Inc.|Ames Department Store]] closed due to bankruptcy and residents were forced to travel 50 miles to [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]] for staples, the town was approached by [[Walmart]] which offered to build a 250,000 square foot [[Wal-Mart#Walmart_Supercenter|supercenter]], but it was felt by the community that Walmart would negatively impact local business and increase traffic. As an alternative a community-owned store was organized and shares were sold to community residents. $500,000 was raised by about 600 residents who made an average investment of $800. goal last spring. The store, Saranac Lake Community Store, opened in October 29, 2011 in remodeled facilities in downtown Saranac Lake. [[Powell, Wyoming]] also has a community store established in 2002 under similar circumstances. In both instances the securities were [[Securities_Act_of_1933#Registration_process|intrastate offerings]] registered under less onerous [[Blue sky law|state securities laws]] rather than [[Securities regulation in the United States|federal law]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Cortese|first=Amy|title=A Town Creates Its Own Department Store|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/business/a-town-in-new-york-creates-its-own-department-store.html|accessdate=November 14, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 12, 2011|quote=Community ownership seems to resonate in these days of protest.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funds were raised in a similar way for an [[independent bookstore]] in Brooklyn, a [[coffeehouse]] in Oakland, and restaurants in [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2009/09/08/smallbusiness/barnraising_a_business.fsb/index.htm "Love a local business?

H.R.2930, the Entrepreneur Access to Capital Act [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.02930:], would relax securities law requirements making it easier for a community to raise money for community owned enterprises.&lt;ref name=Crowdfunding&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Stacy|title=Crowdfunding Bill Would Allow People to Invest in Local Businesses|url=http://www.newrules.org/retail/news/crowdfunding-bill-would-allow-people-invest-local-businesses|publisher=Institute for Local Self-Reliance|accessdate=November 14, 2011|date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3722">'''Damir Kaletović''' is a multiple-award-winning [[investigative journalist]] from [[Tuzla]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He is a former reporter for [http://www.rtvfbih.ba/loc/ FTV], the public-service broadcasting organization of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] [[entity]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former co-host of the FTV-sponsored political talk show "60 Minutes" ([http://bljesak.info/rubrika/vijesti/clanak/specijal-60-minuta--zlocinacka-organizacija/51878 60 minuta]), and a former reporter for [http://www.obn.ba/ OBN Television]. He is best known for his high-profile role as co-host of "60 Minutes", which controversially investigated issues related post-war corruption and war crimes.

He has won numerous awards, including (but not limited to):
* 2005 "[http://bhstring.net/tuzlauslikama/tuzlarije/viewkultura.php?id=857 Most Deserving Journalist of the Year]" in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
* 2005 Max Magazine Television Personality "Man of the Year"[http://newsdemo.atlasproject.eu/asset_demo/news/details/en/details.html?hl=%D0%9D%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B4&amp;ci=a5fdde3d-0b2a-4651-bc4f-0013891b12e6]
* 2008 San News "Best Person of the Year" 
During his career, he has been the target of various threats, some of them openly expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.civilnodrustvo.ba/files/docs/biblioteka/NT_2008_Bosnia.pdf|title = Bosnia-Herzegovina Civil Society / Nations in Transit|date = 2008|accessdate = 2 December 2015|website = Civil Society|publisher = Jasna Jelisic|last = Jelisic|first = Jasna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work has been perceived as controversial by Bosnia-Herzegovina's main ethno-nationalist political parties: the Bosniak Muslim [[Party of Democratic Action]] (SDA); the [[Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ); and the [[Serb Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serbian Democratic Party]] (SDS).

In some of his [[reportage]]s he accused six [[Algeria]]ns of alleged [[terrorism]].

In March 2005, Hodel retired and [[Jim Daly (evangelist)|Jim Daly]], formerly the Vice President in charge of Focus on the Family's International Division, assumed the role of president and chief executive officer.&lt;ref&gt;

In its IRS Form 990 for Tax Year 2015, dated October 26, 2017, Focus on the Family for the first time declared itself a "church, convention of churches or association of churches",  claiming that it was no longer required to file the IRS disclosure form and that the sources and disposition of its $89 million budget were "Not for public inspection." Tax Attorney Gail Harmon, who advises nonprofits on tax law, said she found the declaration "shocking", noting that ""There’s nothing about them that meets the traditional definition of what a church is. They don’t have a congregation, they don’t have the rites of various parts of a person’s life."&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Blue, [http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/focus-on-the-family-has-declared-itself-a-church-avoiding-irs-disclosure-rules/, "Focus On The Family Has Declared Itself A Church, Avoiding IRS Disclosure Rules"], ‘’Right Wing Watch'', February 20, 2018, Retrieved: February 23, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Focus on the Family sees its primary ministry as helping couples "build healthy marriages that reflect God's design", based on what it sees as "morals and values grounded in biblical principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.focusonthefamily.com/about_us.aspx |title=About Us |publisher=Focus on the Family |date= |accessdate=November 11, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724193545/http://www.focusonthefamily.com/about_us.aspx |archive-date=July 24, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group strongly opposes same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Focus on the Family formed [[Love Won Out]], an [[ex-gay]] ministry, in 1998 and in 2009, it was sold to [[Exodus International]]. In June 2013, however, Exodus ceased activities and issued a statement which repudiated its aims and apologized for the harm their pursuit caused to [[LGBT]] people; see ''[[Exodus International#Closure]]''.

===Option Ultrasound Program===
Focus on the Family's Option Ultrasound Program (OUP) provides grants to qualifying [[crisis pregnancy centers]] to cover 80 percent of the cost of an [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] machine or sonography training. As of October 31, 2014, the program has provided 655 grants to centers in all 50 states and Bucharest, [[Romania]]. Focus on the Family began OUP in 2004 with the goal of convincing women not to have abortions. FOTF officials said that ultrasound services help a woman better understand her pregnancy and baby's development, creating an important "bonding opportunity" between "mother and unborn child".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/commented/ci_18223160?source=commented-news "Focus: Donations of ultrasound equipment stopped 100,000 abortions since 2004"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814112823/http://www.denverpost.com/commented/ci_18223160?source=commented-news |date=August 14, 2011 }}. ''The Denver Post''. Retrieved May 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Option Ultrasound Program reported in 2014 that it has helped prevent more than 270,000 abortions since 2004.

===Day of Dialogue===
{{main|Day of Dialogue}}

The [[Day of Dialogue]] is a student-led event which takes place April 16. Founders describe the goal of the event, created in opposition to the anti-bullying and anti-homophobic [[Day of Silence]], as "encouraging honest and respectful conversation among students about God's design for sexuality." It was previously known as the '''Day of Truth''' and was founded by the [[Alliance Defense Fund]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.com/articles/focus-107851-gay-taking.html Focus to sponsor anti-gay observance for students] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114123011/http://www.gazette.com/articles/focus-107851-gay-taking.html |date=November 14, 2010 }}.

===2008 Presidential campaign===
In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]], Focus on the Family shifted from supporting [[Mike Huckabee]], to not supporting any candidate, to finally accepting the Republican ticket once [[Sarah Palin]] was added to the ticket. Prior to the election, a television and letter campaign was launched predicting terrorist attacks in four U.S. cities and equating the U.S. with [[Nazi Germany]]. This publicity was condemned by the [[Anti Defamation League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0810/28/sitroom.02.html |work=CNN |title=CNN.com Video |accessdate=August 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828202628/http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0810/28/sitroom.02.html |archive-date=August 28, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a month before the general election, Focus on the Family began distributing a 16-page letter titled ''Letter from 2012 in Obama's America'', which describes an imagined American future in which "many of our freedoms have been taken away by a liberal [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and a majority of Democrats in both the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/165599 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028113955/http://www.newsweek.com/id/165599 |date=October 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[USA Today]]'', the letter "is part of an escalation in rhetoric from Christian right activists" trying to paint Democratic Party presidential nominee Senator [[Barack Obama]] in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-10-27-christian-right-obama_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Christian right's mailings depict disastrous future under Obama | date=October 28, 2008 | accessdate=May 2, 2010 | first1=Eric | last1=Gorski | first2=Rachel | last2=Zoll | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604035021/http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-10-27-christian-right-obama_N.htm | archive-date=June 4, 2011 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to same-sex marriage===
Focus on the Family works to preserve its interpretation of Biblical ideals of marriage and parenthood, taking a strong stance against LGBT rights, including same-sex marriage. Dobson expressed great concern for the institution of marriage in a 2003 letter to the Christian community. In reference to the same-sex marriage movement, Dobson says that the institution of marriage, "is about to descend into a state of turmoil unlike any other in human history." Focus on the Family believes that marriage should be defined as only being between a man and a woman. Dobson supported the failed [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], which would have defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman, preventing courts and state legislatures from challenging this definition.&lt;ref name="hli"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safamily.co.za/newsletter_dob?mode=content&amp;id=20115&amp;refto=3644 |title=Marriage on the Ropes |author=James Dobson |date=September 2003 |work=Newsletter Archive |publisher=Focus on the Family Southern Africa |authorlink=James Dobson }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same letter, Dobson says that traditional marriage is the cornerstone of society, and he states that the goal of the gay and lesbian movement is not to redefine marriage but to destroy the institution itself. "Most gays and lesbians do not want to marry each other…the intention here is to destroy marriage altogether." Dobson argues that, without the institution of marriage, everyone would enjoy the benefits of marriage without limiting the number of partners or their gender. Focus on the Family views allowing same-sex marriage as "…a stepping-stone on the road to eliminating all societal restrictions on marriage and sexuality."&lt;ref name="hli" /&gt;

Focus on the Family asserts that the Bible lays out the correct plan for marriage and family. Dobson says that "God created Eve to complement Adam physically, spiritually, and emotionally". Dobson also uses the biblical figure [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] to affirm his views on marriage.  He states that Paul maintained that men and women mutually complete each other, and to exchange a "natural relationship for an unnatural one is sinful".&lt;ref name="hli" /&gt;

In reference to same-sex marriage and same-sex couples with children, Dobson states, "Same-sex relationships undermine the future generation's understanding of the fundamental principles of marriage, parenthood, and gender." He also stated that the alleged destruction of what it considers to be the traditional family by permitting same-sex marriage will lead to "unstable homes for children".&lt;ref name="hli" /&gt;

Focus on the Family became more active in the same-sex marriage opposition movement after the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] declared that restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples is a violation of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="hli" /&gt;

Dobson spoke at the 2004 rally against gay marriage called Mayday for Marriage. It was here for the first time that he endorsed a presidential candidate, George W. Bush. Here he denounced the Supreme Court rulings in favor of gay rights, and he urged rally participants to get out and vote so that the battle against gay rights could be won in the Senate.&lt;ref name="KirkPatrick"&gt;{{cite news|last=KirkPatrick|first=David D.|title=THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: SAME-SEX MARRIAGE; Rally Against Gay Marriage Draws Thousands to Capital|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 16, 2004|page=12|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/16/national/16gays.html|accessdate=January 25, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528051651/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/16/national/16gays.html|archive-date=May 28, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Christianity Today|''Christianity Today'' magazine]], Dobson also explained that he was not in favor of [[civil unions]]. He stated that civil unions are just same-sex marriage under a different name. The main priority of the opposing same-sex marriage movement is to define marriage on the federal level as between a man and a woman and combat the passage of civil unions later.&lt;ref name="Rutledge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rutledge|first=Kathleen K.|title=Dobson on the Gay Marriage Battle|journal=[[Christianity Today]]|volume=49|issue=1|date=January 2005|page=60|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/january/21.60.html|accessdate=January 25, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203232105/http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/january/21.60.html|archive-date=February 3, 2010|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Football advertisements===
In 2010, Focus on the Family bought ad time during [[Super Bowl XLIV]] to air a commercial featuring [[Heisman Trophy]] winning [[Florida Gators football|Florida Gators]] [[quarterback]] [[Tim Tebow]] and his mother, Pam. In the ad, Pam described Tim as a "miracle baby" who "almost didn't make it into this world", and further elaborated that "with all our family's been through, we have to be tough" (after which Pam was promptly tackled by Tim). The ad directed viewers to the organization's website.&lt;ref name="latimes-tebowhype"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tebow ad falls short of the hype|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/08/nation/la-na-tebow-abortion8-2010feb08|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=January 19, 2014|first=Robin|last=Abcarian|date=February 8, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221051659/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/08/nation/la-na-tebow-abortion8-2010feb08|archive-date=February 21, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate-tebowad"/&gt;

As of 1998, James Dobson, in his welcome center film, compares his decision to build the headquarters in Colorado Springs to the founding of the temple in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="Ott2"/&gt;

'''Harry Elmer Barnes''' (June 15, 1889 – August 25, 1968) was an [[United States|American]] [[historian]] who, in his later years, was known for his [[historical revisionism]] and [[Holocaust denial]]. Barnes taught history at [[Columbia University]] from 1918 to 1929. Afterwards, he worked as a freelance writer and occasional adjunct professor at smaller schools. Through his position at Columbia and his prodigious scholarly output, Barnes was once highly regarded as a historian. However, by the end of the 1950s, he had lost credibility because of the major role he played in the inception of the Holocaust denial movement.&lt;ref name="Goddard, 1968"&gt;Goddard, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes used his wide reading to summarize vast quantities of information and present histories that would be "usable" to his readers. He published more than 30 books, 100 essays, and 600 articles and book reviews, making him one of the most prolific writers in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Doenecke&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
[[Image:Harryelmerbarnes.jpg|right|frame|Front cover of ''Harry Elmer Barnes, Learned Crusader'', by Arthur Goddard (ed.)]]
Barnes took a PhD at Columbia in 1918 in history with a study in the history of [[penology]]. He was among the graduate students of [[William Archibald Dunning]], who was influential in the history of the [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] in the United States. In 1917 Barnes published the first edition of ''An Introduction to the History of Sociology'', a collaborative work intended to be a comprehensive summary of sociological development. Barnes lectured widely between 1918 and 1941 on current events and recent history.&lt;ref name="Goddard, 1968"/&gt;

During [[World War I]], Barnes had been a strong supporter of the war effort; his anti-[[Germany|German]] propaganda was rejected by the National Board for Historical Service, which described it as  "too violent to be acceptable".&lt;ref name="lipstadt67"&gt;Lipstadt, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Barnes' views towards Germany reversed: he became as much of a [[Germanophile]] as he previously had been [[Anti-German sentiment|Germanophobic]].&lt;ref name="lipstadt67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mombauer86"&gt;Mombauer, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes took the view that the United States had fought on the wrong side in World War I.&lt;ref name="mombauer86" /&gt;

In the 1920s, Barnes was noted as a vehement advocate that Germany had borne no [[Historiography of the causes of World War I|responsibility for the outbreak of war]] in 1914, and had instead been the victim of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] aggression.&lt;ref name="lipstadt67" /&gt; In 1922, Barnes was arguing that the responsibility for World War I was split evenly between the Allies and the [[Central Powers]].&lt;ref name="mombauer86" /&gt; By 1924, Barnes was writing that Austria was the power most responsible for the war, but that [[Russia]] and [[France]] were more responsible than Germany.&lt;ref name="mombauer86" /&gt; By 1926, Barnes argued that Russia and France bore the entire responsibility for the outbreak of war in 1914, and the Central Powers none.&lt;ref name="mombauer86" /&gt; In Barnes' view, "vested political and historical interests" were behind the "official" account that Germany started World War I.&lt;ref name="dawidowicz32"&gt;Dawidowicz, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes' research on the origins of World War I was generously funded in the 1920s by the German Foreign Ministry, which intended to prove that Germany had not started World War I as a way of undermining the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name="herwig26"&gt;Herwig, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In Barnes' articles on the [[causes of World War I]] in ''[[The Nation]]'', ''Current History'', ''Christian Century'', and above all in his 1927 book ''The Genesis of the World War'', he portrayed France and Russia as the aggressors of the [[July Crisis]] of 1914, and Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] as the victims of a Franco-Russian plot.&lt;ref name="herwig26" /&gt; After 1924, Barnes had a close relationship with the [[Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War]], a pseudo-historical think-tank based in Berlin secretly funded by the German government and founded by Major Alfred von Wegerer, the former ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'' activist. The Centre's sole purpose was to prove Germany was the victim of aggression in 1914, and that the Versailles treaty was morally invalid.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig, pp. 22&amp;ndash;23, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre provided Barnes with research material, made funds available to him, translated his writings into other languages, and funded his trip to Germany in 1926.&lt;ref name="herwig26" /&gt; During Barnes' 1926 trip to Germany, the writer was welcomed for his efforts to, as Barnes described it, "clear Germany of the dishonour and fraud of the war-guilt clause of the Treaty of Versailles".&lt;ref name="lipstadt68"&gt;Lipstadt, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his European trip, Barnes met with the former [[German Emperor]], [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]], at his estate in the [[Netherlands]]. According to Barnes, the ruler said that he "was happy to know that I did not blame him for starting the war in 1914."&lt;ref name="lipstadt68" /&gt; However, Barnes added, "He disagreed with my view that Russia and France were chiefly responsible. He held that the villains of 1914 were the international Jews and [[Freemasonry|Free Masons]], who, he alleged, desired to destroy national states and the Christian religion".&lt;ref name="lipstadt68" /&gt;

In addition, during this 1926 trip Barnes met all of the surviving German and Austrian leaders of 1914. Based on their statements, he was confirmed in his belief that Germany was not responsible for World War I.&lt;ref name="mombauer86-87"&gt;Mombauer, pp. 86&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt; To assist Barnes with his writings against the so-called ''Kriegschuldlüge'' ("war guilt lie"), the Germans put Barnes into contact with Milos Boghitschewitsch, a former [[Serbia]]n diplomat living in Berlin. He was considered disreputable as, in exchange for German gold, he provided false testimony about the actions of the Serbian government in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig, pp. 23, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Barnes published ''The Genesis of the World War'', the first American book written about 1914 that was based upon the available primary sources. He argued that World War I was the result of a Franco-Russian plot to destroy Germany.&lt;ref name="mombauer86-87" /&gt; Wegerer wrote about ''The Genesis of the World War'' that it would be "scarcely possible to provide a better book than this one".&lt;ref name="mombauer87"&gt;Mombauer, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes was opposed to the idea of World War I as "just war", which he believed to have been caused by the economic imperialism of France and Russia.&lt;ref name="mombauer87" /&gt; In 1925, Barnes wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we can but understand how totally and terribly we were "taken in" between 1914 and 1918 by the salesmen of this most holy and idealistic world conflict, we shall be the better prepared to be on our guard against the seductive lies and deceptions which will be put forward by similar groups when urging the necessity of another world catastrophe in order to "crush militarism", "make the world safe for democracy", put an end to all further wars, etc.&lt;ref name="mombauer87" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his preface to ''The Genesis of the World War'', Barnes called World War I an "unjust war against Germany".&lt;ref name="mombauer87" /&gt; Barnes wrote in his preface that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the truth about the causes of the World War is one of the livest and most important practical issues of the present day. It is basic to the whole matter of the present European and world situation, resting as it does upon an unfair and unjust Peace Treaty, which was itself erected upon a most uncritical and complete acceptance of the grossest forms of war-time illusions concerning war guilt.&lt;ref name="mombauer87" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Barnes said when writing ''The Genesis of the World War'', he was compelled by "an ardent desire to execute an adequate exposure of the authors of the late World War in particular".&lt;ref name="mombauer87" /&gt; According to Barnes, the responsibility for World War I was as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In estimating the order of guilt of the various countries we may safely say that the only direct and immediate responsibility for the World War falls upon Serbia, France and Russia, with the guilt about equally distributed. Next in order&amp;mdash;far below France and Russia&amp;mdash;would come Austria, through she never desired a general European war. Finally, we place Germany and England as tied for last place, both being opposed to war in the 1914 crisis. Probably the German public was somewhat more favorable to military activity than the English people, but&amp;nbsp;... the Kaiser made much more strenuous efforts to preserve the peace of Europe in 1914 than did Sir Edward Grey.&lt;ref&gt;Mombauer, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The German government so liked Barnes's writings on the causes of World War I that it provided free copies of his articles to hand out at German embassies around the world.&lt;ref name="herwig26" /&gt; Though most German historians in the 1920s regarded Barnes merely as a propagandist whose work was mainly meant to appeal to a mass as opposed to an academic audience, the right-wing German historian Hans Herzfeld called Barnes's work "a document in the struggle against the war guilt thesis whose noble spirit cannot be appreciated enough".&lt;ref name="herwig27"&gt;Herwig, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The German-Canadian historian [[Holger Herwig]] has commented that Barnes's work on the origins of World War I, together with others of a similar bent, did immense scholarly damage, as generations of university students accepted Barnes' "apologias" for Germany as the truth.&lt;ref name="herwig27" /&gt; In 1969, the British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] called ''The Genesis of the World War'' "the most preposterously pro-German" account of the outbreak of war in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. J. P. ''War by Time-Table'', MacDonald Press: London, 1969, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, the American historian [[Bernadotte Schmitt]] wrote about ''The Genesis of the World War'' that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It must be said that Mr. Barnes' book fall short of being the objective and scientific analysis of the great problems which is so urgently needed. As a protest against the old notion of unique German responsibility for the war, it will be welcomed by all honest men, but as an attempt to set up a new doctrine of unique Franco-Russian responsibility, it must be unhesitatingly rejected. The war was a consequence, perhaps inevitable, of the whole system of alliances and armaments, and in the origin, development, and working of that system, the Central Powers, more particularly Germany, played a conspicuous part. Indeed, it was Germany that put the system to the test in July 1914. Because the test failed, she is not entitled to claim that no responsibility attaches to her.&lt;ref&gt;Mombauer, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1980, the American historian [[Lucy Dawidowicz]] attacked Barnes and contrasted his work with the German historian [[Fritz Fischer]]'s book ''Griff nach der Weltmacht'' (''Grasping at World Power'').&lt;ref&gt;Dawidowicz, pp. 31&amp;ndash;32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes's very public attacks on the idea of World War I as a just war, and his thesis that the United States should not have fought in the war, won him the admiration and friendship in the 1920s of many people in the United States such [[Oswald Garrison Villard]], the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] leader [[Norman Thomas]], the critic [[H. L. Mencken]], and the historian [[Charles A. Beard]].&lt;ref name="lipstadt67" /&gt; Long regarded as a leader of the [[progressivism|progressive]] intelligentsia, Barnes joined many of its intellectual leaders such as Beard in opposing from the left the [[New Deal]] and, at the price of their reputations, American entry into [[World War II]]. In the years following the war, he argued that [[Adolf Hitler]] did not want to go to war with the United States and that President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had deliberately provoked the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name="dawidowicz32" /&gt; He also contested many aspects of [[the Holocaust]], claiming death figures were far lower&lt;ref name=Atkins146&gt;Atkins, pp. 146&amp;ndash;147.&lt;/ref&gt; and arguing that all sides were guilty of equally awful atrocities.

==World War II==
In the late 1930s, Barnes emerged as a leading [[isolationism|isolationist]] and German apologist who defended German foreign policy as a legitimate effort to overthrow the Treaty of Versailles, which Barnes regarded as monstrously unfair to Germany.&lt;ref name="lipstadt68" /&gt; In 1937, Barnes identified as a "[[United States non-interventionism|noninterventionist]]" opposed to the United States being involved in any sort of foreign war.&lt;ref name="dawidowicz32" /&gt; After World War II, Barnes continued to expound his pre-war views of European diplomacy. In 1939, Barnes published an article that charged British diplomat Sir [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]] with scheming to commit aggression against Germany in the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="lipstadt80"&gt;Lipstadt, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Vansittart sued Barnes for [[libel]].&lt;ref name="lipstadt80" /&gt; In a letter to his friend Oswald Villard, Barnes said that Vansittart's libel suit against him was a "plot of the Jews and the [[Anti-Defamation League]] to intimidate any American historians who propose to tell the truth about the causes of the war".&lt;ref name="lipstadt80" /&gt; Barnes said that [[Louis Nizer]], Vansittart's lawyer, was an "Anti-Defamation League stooge" who had "needled Vansittart into action".&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, pp. 80&amp;ndash;81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes wrote further:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If I could raise money enough for a real defense we could make this an international ''cause celebre'', but I cannot fight the thirty million dollars now in the coffers of the Anti-Defamation League to be used for character assassination on empty pockets. If we let them get away with this, we are licked from the start.&lt;ref name="lipstadt81"&gt;Lipstadt, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The American historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]] has documented that the Anti-Defamation League had nothing to do with Vansittart or his libel suit against Barnes. She says that Barnes' claims otherwise were a sign of his anti-Semitism.&lt;ref name="lipstadt81" /&gt;

In 1940, the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' newspaper dropped Barnes' weekly column. The writer responded by complaining the action was due to a conspiracy against him, involving the British [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] intelligence service, the [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.|House of Morgan]], and all of the Jewish department store owners in [[New York City]]. Barnes alleged that the latter had threatened the publisher of the ''New York World-Telegram'' with the "loss of all advertising if he kept me on any longer".&lt;ref name="lipstadt81" /&gt;

After World War II, Barnes was increasingly strident in his writing, which alienated many and made it difficult for his writings to gain publication.&lt;ref name="dawidowicz32" /&gt; Most of Barnes' work after 1945 was self-published.&lt;ref name="dawidowicz32" /&gt; In particular, Barnes claimed that a historical black-out had covered up the real [[Causes of World War II|origins of World War II]].&lt;ref name="dawidowicz32" /&gt; In his 1947 pamphlet, "The Struggle Against The Historical Blackout", Barnes claimed that "court historians" suppressed that Hitler was the most "reasonable" leader in the world in 1939, and that France's Premier [[Édouard Daladier]] wanted to commit aggression against Germany aided and abetted by a scheming and dishonest British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and the U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.&lt;ref name="lipstadt68-69"&gt;Lipstadt, pp. 68&amp;ndash;69.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same pamphlet, Barnes claimed that, as part of the alleged smear campaign that had been committed against Germany, Allied governments had falsely charged Germany with responsibility for crimes that she did not commit.&lt;ref name="lipstadt69"&gt;Lipstadt, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Barnes wrote to Villard, saying that [[Winston Churchill]] and Roosevelt, "backed by certain pressure groups", caused the outbreak of war in 1939.&lt;ref name="lipstadt70"&gt;Lipstadt, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1948, Barnes wrote a statement saying that France had repeatedly committed aggression against Germany, and that, "Offhand I cannot recall a really unprovoked German invasion of France in modern times".&lt;ref name="lipstadt70" /&gt; Barnes' statement contained a list of every French invasion of Germany starting in 1552 and ended with: "1918 French invade Germany with American aid. 1944&amp;ndash;45 French again ride into Germany on the backs of the Americans."&lt;ref name="lipstadt70" /&gt;

In a letter to his friend [[Charles Tansill]] in 1950, Barnes described German foreign policy in 1939 as the "most reasonable of them all".&lt;ref name="lipstadt68" /&gt; Barnes wrote that Britain was "almost solely responsible for the outbreak of war on both the Eastern and Western fronts."&lt;ref name="lipstadt69" /&gt; In Barnes' view, Germany did not "precipitously launch" an invasion of [[Poland]] in 1939, but was instead "forced" into war by British "acts of economic strangulation".&lt;ref name="lipstadt68-69" /&gt;

In a 1953 essay, "Revisionism and the Historical Black-out", which appeared in Barnes' self-published book, ''Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace,'' he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is no exaggeration to say that the American Smearbund, operating through newspaper editors and columnists, "hatchet-men" book reviewers, radio commentators, pressure-group intrigue and espionage, and academic pressures and fears, has accomplished about as much in the way of intimidating honest intellectuals in this country as Hitler, Goebbels, Himmler, the Gestapo, and concentration camps were able to do in Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="dawidowicz32" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A strong non-interventionist, Barnes was very publicly opposed to the United States fighting in the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name="dawidowicz32" /&gt;

In 1955, Barnes first met [[David Hoggan]], and played a key role in helping Hoggan adapt his 1948 PhD dissertation, ''The Breakdown of German-Polish Relations in 1939: The Conflict Between the German New Order and the Polish Idea of Central Eastern Europe,'' into his 1961 book, ''Der erzwungene Krieg'' (''The Forced War''). It was "based on, but quite different from, the dissertation", and Hoggan blamed Britain and Poland for World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Barnes self-published a pamphlet, "Blasting the Historical Black-out", in which he offered some praise for A. J. P. Taylor's 1961 book, ''[[The Origins of the Second World War]].''&lt;ref name="dawidowicz33"&gt;Dawidowicz , p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes said that he thought Hoggan's book was better than Taylor's.&lt;ref name="dawidowicz33" /&gt; In "Blasting the Historical Black-out", Barnes referred to the "alleged wartime crimes of Germany" and wrote that, "Even assuming that all the charges ever made by the Nazis by anybody of reasonable sanity and responsibility are true, the Allies did not come off much, if any better".&lt;ref name="dawidowicz33" /&gt; Barnes wrote further that the suffering by [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|ethnic Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia and Poland after World War II]] were "obviously far more hideous and prolonged than those of the Jews said to have been exterminated in great numbers by the Nazis."&lt;ref name="dawidowicz33" /&gt;

Responding to an extremely hostile review of ''Der erzwungene Krieg'' by the American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] in the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' in October 1962, Barnes and Hoggan wrote a series of letters rebutting Weinberg's arguments. Weinberg in turn wrote letters replying to and rebutting the arguments of Hoggan and Barnes.&lt;ref name="dawidowicz32" /&gt; The exchanges between Hoggan and Barnes on one side and Weinberg on the other became increasingly rancorous and vitriolic; in October 1963, the editors of the ''American Historical Review'' announced that (in the interests of decorum) they would cease publishing letters relating to Hoggan's book.

In his 1962 pamphlet, "Revisionism and Brainwashing", Barnes claimed that there was a "lack of any serious opposition or concerted challenge to the atrocity stories and other modes of defamation of German national character and conduct."&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, pp. 73&amp;ndash;74.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes wrote that, in his view, there was "a failure to point out the atrocities of the Allies were more brutal, painful, mortal and numerous than the most extreme allegations made against the Germans."&lt;ref name="lipstadt74"&gt;Lipstadt, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting at this time, Barnes started to cite the French Holocaust denier [[Paul Rassinier]], whom Barnes described as a "distinguished French historian" who had exposed the "exaggerations of the atrocity stories".&lt;ref name="lipstadt74" /&gt; In a 1964 article entitled "Zionist Fraud", published in ''[[The American Mercury]],'' Barnes wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The courageous author [Rassinier] lays the chief blame for misrepresentation on those whom we must call the swindlers of the crematoria, the Israeli politicians who derive billions of marks from nonexistent, mythical and imaginary cadavers, whose numbers have been reckoned in an unusually distorted and dishonest manner.&lt;ref name="lipstadt74" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1964, Barnes and Rassinier met and became friends.&lt;ref name="dawidowicz33" /&gt; As a result, Barnes translated Rassinier's book ''The Drama Of the European Jews'' into English; it was published by an anti-Semitic publishing house named Liberty Bell.&lt;ref name="dawidowicz33" /&gt;

Using Rassinier as his source, Barnes claimed that Germany was the victim of aggression in both 1914 and 1939, and that the Holocaust was just propaganda to justify a [[war of aggression]] against Germany in the latter case.&lt;ref name="lipstadt74" /&gt; Barnes thought that World War II had ended in disaster for the West, because Germany was divided and the United States locked into the [[Cold War]]. Barnes thought that this was a terrible outcome, as he asserted that Germany never wanted war.&lt;ref name="lipstadt75"&gt;Lipstadt, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes claimed that, in order to justify the "horrors and evils of the Second World War", the Allies made the Nazis the "scapegoat" for their own misdeeds.&lt;ref name="lipstadt75" /&gt;

Barnes said there were two false claims made about World War II; namely, that Germany started the war in 1939, and that they conducted the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="lipstadt75" /&gt; In Barnes' opinion: "Hitler setting off the war was also deemed responsible for the wholesale extermination of the Jews, for it was admitted that this did not begin until a considerable time after war broke out."&lt;ref name="lipstadt75" /&gt; Barnes said: "The size of the German reparations to Israel has been based on the ''theory'' that vast numbers of Jews were exterminated at the ''express order of Hitler'', some six million being the most usually accepted number" (emphasis in the original).&lt;ref name="lipstadt75"/&gt;

Barnes repeated his ideas many times. In his 1966 essay "Revisionism: A Key to Peace", Barnes wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even if one were to accept the most extreme and exaggerated indictment of Hitler and the National Socialists for their activities after 1939 made by anybody fit to remain outside a mental hospital, it is most alarmingly easy to demonstrate that the atrocities of the Allies in the same period were more numerous as to victims and were carried out for the most part ''by methods more brutal and painful then that alleged extermination in gas ovens''. (Emphasis in the original.)&lt;ref name="lipstadt76"&gt;Lipstadt, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1967 pamphlet, "The Public Stake in Revisionism", Barnes said that the historical "blackout" with regards to World War II had become a "smotherout" as a result of the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]].&lt;ref name="lipstadt76" /&gt; Writing about the Eichmann trial of 1961, Barnes said that the trial showed "an almost adolescent gullibility and excitability on the part of Americans relative to German wartime crimes, real or ''alleged''" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name="lipstadt76" /&gt; Barnes wrote that the charges against Eichmann rested on "fundamental but ''unproved'' assumptions that what Hitler and the National Socialists did in the years ''after'' Britain and the United States entered the war revealed that they were&amp;nbsp;... vile, debased, brutal and bloodthirsty gangsters" (emphasis in the original).&lt;ref name="lipstadt76" /&gt; Barnes accused the American media of publishing "sensational articles" about "exaggerated National Socialist savagery".&lt;ref name="lipstadt76" /&gt; Barnes described the expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe as the "final solution" for the German people. Writing of the expulsion of the ethnic Germans from the [[Sudetenland]] region of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1945&amp;ndash;46, he claimed that "at least four million of them perished in the process from butchery, starvation and disease."&lt;ref name="lipstadt76" /&gt; Barnes wrote that the Anglo-American bombing offensive, together with the expulsions of the ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe, were far worse than anything the Nazis were alleged to have done.&lt;ref name="lipstadt76" /&gt; In "The Public Stake in Revisionisim", Barnes wrote that "The number of civilians exterminated by the Allies, before, during, and after the Second World War, equaled, if it did not far exceed those liquidated by the Germans and the Allied liquidation program was often carried out by methods which were far more brutal and painful then ''whatever extermination actually took place'' in German gas ovens".&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, pp. 76&amp;ndash;77.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes said that certain (unnamed) "court historians" were guilty of ensuring that Allied war crimes were never "cogently and frankly placed over against the doings, ''real or alleged'', at Auschwitz."&lt;ref name="lipstadt77"&gt;Lipstadt, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes acknowledged that there were [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps in Nazi Germany]], but denied there were ever [[death camps]].&lt;ref name="lipstadt77" /&gt; Barnes said that when "court historians" were forced by "revisionists" to admit there were no death camps, the evidence for [[gas chamber]]s at the death camps was manufactured.&lt;ref name="lipstadt77" /&gt;

Barnes wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is deemed important today is not whether Hitler started war in 1939 or whether Roosevelt was responsible for Pearl Harbour, but the number of prisoners were ''allegedly'' done to death in the concentration camps operated by Germany during the war. These camps were first presented as those in Germany, such as Dachau, Belsen, Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen, and Dora, but it was demonstrated that there had been no systematic extermination in those camps. Attention was then moved on to Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec, Chelmno, Jonoska, Tarnow, Ravensbrück, Mauthausen, Breznia and Birkenau, which does not exhaust the list that appears to have been extended as needed.&lt;ref name="lipstadt77" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Barnes claimed that "court historians", to keep the public from getting "bored", manufactured stories about German crimes against humanity that were "made more unceasing, exaggerated and inflammatory".&lt;ref name="lipstadt78"&gt;Lipstadt, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the German historian [[Martin Broszat]] wrote a letter in 1962 clarifying and defining the differences between concentration and death camps.&lt;ref name="lipstadt78" /&gt; In his letter to the ''[[Die Zeit]]'' newspaper, Broszat wrote that he wanted to "hammer home, once more, the persistently ignored or denied difference between concentration and extermination camps."&lt;ref name="lipstadt78" /&gt; In his letter, Broszat claimed this was not an "admission" that there was no Holocaust, but rather an attempt to "set the record straight" about the differences between concentration and death camps.&lt;ref name="lipstadt78" /&gt; Broszat noted the differences between concentration camps, which were places where the inmates were consistently mistreated, but were not the subject of annihilation, and death camps, which existed solely for the purpose of exterminating their inmates. Broszat denied there was a functioning gas chamber at the [[Dachau concentration camp]] (though he noted that one was built shortly before the end of the war as part of the effort to convert Dachau into a death camp, but was never used). Broszat commented that, though there were many concentration camps in Germany, all of the German death camps for the genocide of the European Jews were located in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|Nazi-occupied Poland]].&lt;ref name="lipstadt78" /&gt; Broszat argued that this confusion in the public's mind between concentration and death camps, and the tendency to erroneously describe Dachau as a death camp, was aiding the early Holocaust deniers like Rassinier, Hoggan, and Barnes, who made much of the fact that there was no functioning gas chamber at Dachau.&lt;ref name="lipstadt78" /&gt; In the same way, Barnes denied that the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' murdered millions of Jews in the occupied [[Soviet Union]], and instead claimed that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were "battling guerilla warfare behind the lines".&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, pp. 78&amp;ndash;79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes often attacked [[West Germany]] for apologizing to the Jews for the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="lipstadt78" /&gt; He wrote that the West German government should challenge the "unfair" verdict and "false dogmas" of World War II, which he claimed prevented "the restoration of Germany to its proper position of unity, power and respect among the nations of the world".&lt;ref name="lipstadt78" /&gt; Barnes drew unfavorable contrasts between the [[Weimar Republic]], which had in the 1920s vigorously fought the so-called ''Kriegsschuldlüge'' ("war guilt lie") that Germany started World War I, with the "masochistic" behavior of the government of [[Konrad Adenauer]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="lipstadt78" /&gt; Barnes accused Adenauer of having "brainwashed" and "indoctrinated" the German people into believing an "indictment of German responsibility for the war".&lt;ref name="lipstadt78" /&gt; Barnes accused Adenauer of "opposing the discovery and publication of the truth".&lt;ref name="lipstadt78" /&gt; Barnes professed to be "deeply puzzled" that the West German government was willing to accept responsibility for the Holocaust and its "downright disinclination to seek to refute the most outrageous charges of cruelty and barbarism leveled against Germany by conscienceless atrocity mongers and the continuation to this very day of not-so-little Nuremberg trials."&lt;ref name="lipstadt78" /&gt; In 1962, Barnes attacked the West German president [[Heinrich Lübke]] for his speech in Israel asking for forgiveness for the German people for the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="lipstadt79"&gt;Lipstadt, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes called the speech "almost incredible grovelling" and "subserviency" to the Jews.&lt;ref name="lipstadt79" /&gt; Barnes often said that Jews contended that they had been the victims of anti-Semitism throughout the ages, which he thought was false.&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, pp. 81&amp;ndash;82.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes claimed that those questioned this view were unjustly labeled anti-Semitic.&lt;ref name="lipstadt82"&gt;Lipstadt, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Barnes, those behind the "smotherout" about Nazi Germany believed that "it was far worse to exterminate Jews, even at the ratio of two Gentiles to one Jew, than to liquidate Gentiles."&lt;ref name="lipstadt82"/&gt;

Lipstadt's 1993 book ''[[Denying the Holocaust]]'' devotes chapter 4, "The First Stirrings of Denial in America", to Barnes as the main link between revisionism in the 1920s (re-evaluation of German responsibility for World War I) and the emergence in the 1950s of Holocaust denial (arguing that the Jewish Holocaust either did not happen or was exaggerated by wartime Allied propaganda and postwar Jewish politics). She notes that the German government of the 1920s enthusiastically supported and promoted Barnes' views as exonerating their country, but the postwar West German government accepted national responsibility for the Holocaust, solicited forgiveness, and paid reparations to Jewish survivors. This difference meant that Barnes in his later years had allied himself with American and European anti-Semites and cranks, rather than with respectable or official opinion. Historian Lucy Dawidowicz concurs.&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, pp. 71&amp;ndash;73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dawidowicz, pp. 31&amp;ndash;33.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heckler's veto''' is an [[Free speech in the United States|American free speech]] term describing situations in which a party who disagrees with a speaker's message is able to unilaterally trigger events that result in the speaker being silenced.

In the legal sense, a heckler's veto occurs when the speaker's right is curtailed or restricted by the government in order to prevent a ''reacting party's'' behavior. The common example is the termination of a speech or demonstration in the interest of maintaining the public peace based on the anticipated negative reaction of someone opposed to that speech or demonstration. The term was coined by  [[University of Chicago]] professor of law [[Harry Kalven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nazi/Skokie Conflict: A Civil Liberties Battle |first=David |last=Hamlin |location=Boston |publisher=Beacon Press |year=1980 |page=57 |isbn=0-8070-3230-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=The current citation, Kalven's 1980 book, does not support this contention.

Colloquially, the term is used to describe situations where [[hecklers]] or demonstrators silence a speaker without intervention of the law.

== Law ==
[[Case law in the United States|In the United States]], [[case law]] regarding the heckler's veto is mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGaffey|first=Ruth|date=1973|title=The Heckler's Veto|url=https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/mulr/vol57/iss1/3|journal=Marquette Law Review|volume=57|pages=39-64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most findings say that the acting party's actions cannot be pre-emptively stopped due to ''fear'' of heckling by the reacting party, but in the immediate face of violence, authorities can force the acting party to cease their action in order to satisfy the hecklers.

The best known case involving the heckler's veto is probably ''[[Feiner v. New York]]'', handed down by the Supreme Court in 1951.  Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]], writing for the majority, held that police officers acted within their power in arresting a speaker if the arrest was "motivated solely by a proper concern for the preservation of order and protection of the general welfare".  340 U.S. 315.

In ''[[Gregory v. Chicago]]'' (1969), Justice [[Hugo Black]], in a concurring opinion, argued that arresting demonstrators as a consequence of unruly behavior of by-standers would amount to a heckler's veto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2280&amp;context=mulr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3D%2522gregory%2520v.%2520chicago%2522%2520%2522heckler%27s%2520veto%2522%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CB4QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fscholarship.law.marquette.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D2280%2526context%253Dmulr%26ei%3DhwobT6bCC4KwiQKyroWwCA%26usg%3DAFQjCNEmEqL_BCo_q6ztr-M8oQXxLcWTPg#search=%22gregory%20v.%20chicago%20hecklers%20veto%22|title= The Heckler's Veto: A Reexamination|author=|date=|website=marquette.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was rejected in ''[[Hill v. Colorado]]'' (2000),&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite court  |litigants = Hill v. Colorado  |vol = 530 U.S. 703, 735  |reporter =   |opinion =   |pinpoint =   |court = [[SCOTUS]]  |year = 2000  |url=http://supreme.vlex.com/vid/hill-v-colorado-20080806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] rejected the "Heckler's Veto," finding "governmental grants of power to private actors" to be "constitutionally problematic" in cases where "the regulations allowed a single, private actor to unilaterally silence a speaker".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Other uses of the phrase ==
Heckler's veto is often used outside a strict legal context. One example is an article by [[Nat Hentoff]] in which he claims that "First Amendment law is clear that everyone has the right to picket a speaker, and to go inside the hall and heckle him or her—but not to drown out the speaker, let alone rush the stage and stop the speech before it starts. That's called the 'heckler's veto'."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0645,hentoff,74928,2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hentoff's formulation, the heckler him or herself is the party which directly carries out the "veto" and suppresses speech. This runs counter to the legal meaning of the phrase. Note that, to a lawyer familiar with the First Amendment law, the phrase "heckler's veto" means something different from what the plain English interpretation of the words suggests. In First Amendment law, a heckler's veto is the suppression of speech by the government, because of [the possibility of] a violent reaction by hecklers. It is the government that vetoes the speech, because of the reaction of the heckler. Under the First Amendment, this kind of heckler's veto is unconstitutional.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/heckler.htm|title=Heckler's Veto|first=Dr. Ronald B.|last=Standler|date=|website=www.rbs2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of California, Berkeley]] Law School Dean [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] has invoked the concept in an editorial following an incident on February 8, 2010, in which heckling by individual students disrupted a speech by the [[List of Israeli ambassadors to the United States|Israeli ambassador]] [[Michael Oren]]. Chemerinsky explained that broad freedom exists to invite speakers and hold demonstrations, but that once a speaker has begun an invited lecture, “You have the right—if you disagree with me—to go outside and perform your protest. But you don’t get the right to come in when I’m talking and shout me down. Otherwise people can always silence a speaker by heckler’s veto, and [[Tower of Babel|Babel]] results”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Israel: Interrupted in Irvine |first=David |last=Lumb |date=Feb 15, 2010 |publisher=[[New University (newspaper)|New University]] |url=http://www.newuniversity.org/2010/02/news/israel-interrupted-in-irvine/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michigan State University]] professor of political science [[William B. Allen]] has used the phrase "verbal terrorism" to refer to the same phenomenon, defining it as "calculated assault characterized by loud side-conversations, shouted interruptions, jabbered false facts, threats and personal insults".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ending racial preferences: the Michigan story |first=Carol M. |last=Allen |location=Lanham |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2008 |page=56 |isbn=978-0-7391-2433-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative writer and commentator [[Ben Shapiro]] cited the term during a 2017 testimony to Congress in reference to suppression of right-wing speakers on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oMblRBElJk|title=Ben Shapiro Crushes Anti-Free Speech College Snowflakes Before Congress|first=|last=THE LIBERTY DAILY|date=27 July 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human rights in Zambia''' are addressed in the [[constitution]]. However, the [[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|''Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Zambia for 2012'']] by the [[United States Department of State]] noted that in general, the government's [[human rights]] record remained poor. 

==Serious abuses==

The ''Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Zambia for 2012'' noted the following serious human rights abuses:&lt;ref name="USDOS-2012-HumanRightsReportforZimbia"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204181 "Zambia"], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 22 March 2013. Retrieved 22 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* abuses by security forces, including unlawful killings, torture, and beatings; 
* life-threatening prison conditions; 
* restrictions on freedom of speech, assembly, and association;
* arbitrary arrest and prolonged pretrial detention; 
* arbitrary interference with privacy; 
* government corruption;
* violence and discrimination against women, child abuse, and trafficking in persons; 
* discrimination against persons with disabilities and based on sexual orientation;
* restrictions on labor rights, forced labor, and child labor; and
* that the government generally did not take steps to prosecute or punish officials who committed abuses, allowing impunity to remain a problem.
* unlawful arrests and application of wrong charges on wrong cases .Eg the treason case of Hakainde Hichilemain 2017

==''Freedom in the World'' ratings==

The following are Zambia's ratings since 1972 in the [[Freedom in the World]] reports, published annually by [[Freedom House]] (1 is best, 7 is worst).&lt;ref name='FH1972'&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%20All%20Scores%2C%20Countries%2C%201973-2012%20%28FINAL%29.xls | title = Country ratings and status, Freedom in the World 1973-2012 | accessdate = 22 August 2012 | publisher = [[Freedom House]] | date = 2012 | format = XLS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freedom of the press ==
{{Main|Press freedom in Zambia}}

Freedoms of expression and of the press are constitutionally guaranteed in Zambia, but the government frequently restricts these rights in practice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldaudit.org/presstable.html|title=Press Freedom survey on 186 countries|website=www.worldaudit.org|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ruling Patriotic Front has pledged to free state-owned media—consisting of the [[Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation]] (ZNBC) and the widely circulated ''[[Zambia Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[Times of Zambia]]''—from government editorial control, these outlets have generally continued to report along pro-government lines. Many journalists reportedly practice self-censorship since most government newspapers do have prepublication review.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ZNBC dominates the broadcast media, though several private stations have the capacity to reach large portions of the population.

The rights group [[Freedom House]], which publishes annual country reports on press freedom status, has ranked Zambia’s press as “Not Free” even in 2016.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/zambia|title=Zambia {{!}} Country report {{!}} Freedom of the Press {{!}} 2016|website=freedomhouse.org|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37864">'''Indigenous People's Rights Act of 1997 (IPRA)''' ('''RA 8371''') is a legislation that recognize and promote all the rights of Indigenous Cultural Communities/[[indigenous peoples of the Philippines|Indigenous Peoples]] of the [[Philippines]].

==History==

=== Early Beginnings ===
Year 1909, in the case of [http://www.chanrobles.com/scdecisions/jurisprudence1906/dec1906/gr_l-2746_1906.php Cariño vs. Insular] Government, the court has recognized long occupancy of land by an indigenous member of the cultural communities as one of private ownership, which, in legal concept, is termed "native title".  This case paved the way for the government to review the so-called "native title" or "private right." In the year 1919, the Second Public Land Act was enacted, recognizing the right of ownership of any native of the country who, since July 4, 1907, or prior thereto, has continuously occupied and cultivated, either by himself or through his predecessors-in-interest, a tract of agricultural public land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Acts - The LawPhil Project|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/acts/acts.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-07-03|first = Philipp|last = Bautista}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Commonwealth Act No.141, amended by R.A. 3872 of 1964, was passed which provides that members of the national cultural minorities who have resided on agricultural, public land since July 4, 1955 are entitled to recognition of ownership whether or not the land has been certified as "disposable." They shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all conditions essential to a government grant and shall be entitled to a certificate of title.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Guide to R.A. 8371|last = |first = |publisher = Coalition for Indigenous Peoples' Rights and Ancestral Domains|year = 1998|isbn = |location = Manila|pages = |editor-last = Damaso|editor-first = Elena|editor-last2 = De Guzman|editor-first2 = Ma. Vicenta|editor-last3 = Manzano|editor-first3 = Florence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the laws protecting indigenous people's lands expanded to territorial and bigger domains. Under Bureau of Forestry Administrative Order No. 11 of 1970, all forest concessions were made subject to the private rights of cultural minorities within the area as evidenced by their occupation existing at the time a license is issued by the government.  The Revised Forestry Code of 1975 (Presidential Decree 705 under President Marcos) defines this "private right" of as "places of abode and worship, burial grounds and old clearings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Presidential Decree No. 705, s. 1975 {{!}} Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|url = http://www.gov.ph/1975/05/19/presidential-decree-no-705-s-1975/|accessdate = 2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the Presidential Arm for National Minorities ([[PANAMIN]]) was authorized to design, implement and maintain settlements among the National Minorities. Prior to this, a Presidential Decree was issued in 1974, "declaring all agricultural lands occupied and cultivated by members of the national Cultural Communities since 1964 as alienable and disposable, except the islands of Panay and Negros and the provinces of Abra, Quezon, Benguet and Camarines which became effective on March 11, 1984."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The most recent laws before the Indigenous People's Rights Act of 1997 was passed which recognize the existence of ancestral land right are the Organic Act of [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (RA 6734, 1989), and the Organic Act for the [[Cordillera Autonomous Region creation plebiscite, 1998|Cordillera Autonomous Region]] (RA 6766, 1989).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Historical Evolution of RA.8371 ===
The decrees that have been passed fail to encompass all the needs of the indigenous people primarily because of failure in implementation and sole focus on the land and domains only.

Because of this, a more comprehensive law is needed that "seeks to stop prejudice against indigenous people through recognition of certain rights over their ancestral lands, and to live in accordance recognize and protect the rights of the indigenous people not only to their ancestral domain but to social justice and human rights, self-determination and empowerment, and their cultural integrity,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" This then gave birth to movements for a comprehensive law that will protect not only the lands, but human rights of the Filipino indigenous people.

CIPRAD or the Coalition for Indigenous People's Rights and Ancestral Domains is an alliance of Indigenous People's Organizations (IPOs) and non-government organizations (NGOs) created to pursue the advocacy for IP rights and ancestral domains. The Coalition is participated by IPOs in the Cordillera, Region I, Nueva Vizcaya, Cagayan, Caraballo, Sierra Madre, Quezon, Aurora, Quirino, Nueva Ecija, Zambales, Pampanga, Bulacan, Mindoro Occidental, Palawan, Panay, Davao, Cagayan, Cotabato and Zamboanga. CIPRAD partnered with various NGOs organizations such as Episcopal Commission on Indigenous Peoples, National Peace Conference, Center for Living Heritage and PANLIPI (Legal Assistance Center for Indigenous Filipinos) in order to lobby for the IPRA or Indigenous People's Rights Act.

IPRA, formerly known as Ancestral Domain Bill, was first filed in the Congress sometime in 1987 under the Senate Bill No. 909 authored by Senator [[Nina Rasul|Santanina Rasul]], Senator Joseph Estrada and Senator [[Alberto Romulo]], during the [[8th Congress of the Philippines|8th Congress]], but was never enacted in to law. In the 9th Congress, Senator Rasul introduced Senate Bill No. 1029 and Senator Macapagal-Arroyo introduced Senate Bill No. 1849. However, the bill was never sponsored and deliberated upon in the floor.

Despite these failed efforts, the IPOs decided to give it another try. Decisions have been made during social negotiations among NGOs and POs to rename the bill from Ancestral Domain Bill to Indigenous Peoples Rights Act to emphasize the holistic approach and character of the bill. A consensus was made on December 1995 between IP representatives and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] representatives. Seven non-negotiable points of the bill that were promoted are the following:

a) recognition of native ttitle and rights of IPs to ancestral domains, b )respect for the right to cultural integrity, c) recognition of indigenous peoples’ political structures and governance, d) delivery of basic services to the indigenous peoples, e) respect for human rights, f) elimination of discrimination, g) and creation of an office that would cater to the IPs needs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Year 1996, during the 10th Congress, Senator [[Juan Flavier]] sponsored the Bill no. 1728 which meant that he has to defend the bill in all the Senate deliberations and discussions. In his sponsorship speech, he discussed the legal bases for the bill which can be found in the 1987 Constitution. He also discussed the basic rights of the ICCs, the contents of the bill itself, and the immediate need of protection of the Filipino Indigenous People.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Despite difficult hurdles and amendments enacted in the Congress which nearly brought the movement to its death, the House of Representatives finally approved the bill late in September 1997. President Fidel V. Ramos signed it on 22 October 1997 officially making it Republic Act No. 8371 Indigenous People's Rights Act of 1997 which aims to "Recognize, Protect and Promote the Rights of Indigenous cultural Communities/Indigenous Peoples (ICCs/IPS) and for other Purposes."

The term indigenous cultural communities (ICCs) was used in the Philippine Constitution to describe a group of people sharing common bonds of language, customs, traditions and other distinctive cultural traits, and who have, under claims of ownership since time immemorial, occupied, possessed and utilized a territory. Time immemorial refers to a period of time when as far back as memory can go, certain ICCs/IPs are known to have occupied, possessed and utilized a defined territory devolved to them by operation of custom law/traditions or inherited from their ancestors.

Both the terms IPs and ICCs refer to homogenous societies identified by self-ascription and ascription by others, who have continuously lived as a community on communally bounded and defined territory, sharing common bonds of customs, traditions and other cultural traits, through resistance to political, social and cultural inroads to colonization, non-indigenous religions and culture. Whereas, the Filipino majority learned very well the ways of the colonial masters by adapting to their laws and practices, the minority (IPs), consciously asserted the integrity of their ancestral territories, pre-Hispanic native culture and justice systems which are viewed as diametrically opposed to the majority's world view, but which the IPRA law attempts to recognize and interface with the national legal system.

Ancestral Domains

The 1997 IPRA Law defines ancestral domains as "areas generally belonging to ICCs/IPs comprising lands, inland waters, coastal areas, and natural resources held under a claim of ownership, occupied or possessed by ICCs/IPs, by themselves or through their ancestors, communally or individually since time immemorial, continuously to the present even when interrupted by war, force majeure or displacement by force, deceit, stealth or as a consequence of government projects or any other voluntary dealings entered into by government and private individuals or corporations, and which are necessary to ensure their economic, social and cultural welfare. It shall include forests, pastures, residential, agricultural and other lands individually owned whether alienable and disposable otherwise, hunting grounds, burial rounds, worship areas, bodies of water, mineral and other natural resources and lands which may no longer be exclusively occupied by ICCs/IPs but from which they traditionally had access to for their subsistence and traditional activities, particularly the home ranges of ICCs and IPs who are still nomadic and or shifting cultivators."&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Republic Act No. 8371 {{!}} Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|url = http://www.gov.ph/1997/10/29/republic-act-no-8371/|accessdate = 2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestral domains include the spiritual and cultural bonds to the areas which the ICCs/IPs possess, occupy and use and to which they have claims of ownership (inherited from ancestors). This generally refer to areas which they have possessed at a period of time when as far back as memory can go. Proofs of time immemorial possession main may include testimony of elders, historical accounts, anthropological or ethnographic studies, names of places, using dialect or language of indigenous peoples, genealogy, treaties or pacts, between or among indigenous peoples and or other populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Ancestral Lands ===

Ancestral lands, as stated in the law, refer to "lands occupied, possessed and utilized by individuals, families and clans who are members of the ICCs/IPs since time immemorial, by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest, under claims of individual or traditional group ownership, continuously, to the present even when interrupted by war, force majeure or displacement by force, deceit, stealth or as a consequence of government projects, and other voluntary dealings entered into by government and private individuals/corporations, including, but not limited to residential lots, rice terraces or paddies, private forests, swidden farms and tree lots."&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Ancestral land owners are given the right to transfer these ancestral lands and the right to redeem ancestral lands lost through vitiated consent. This is different with ancestral domains in a sense that this specifically refers to the land while the domain may include land, water, and aerial territories.

== Key Provisions ==

=== Right of Empowerment and Self Governance ===
SECTION 13. Self-Governance. — The State recognizes the inherent right of ICCs/IPs to self-governance and self-determination and respects the integrity of their values, practices and institutions. Consequently, the State shall guarantee the right of ICCs/IPs to freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.

SECTION 14. Support for Autonomous Regions. — The State shall continue to strengthen and support the autonomous regions created under the Constitution as they may require or need. The State shall likewise encourage other ICCs/IPs not included or outside Muslim Mindanao and the Cordilleras to use the form and content of their ways of life as may be compatible with the fundamental rights defined in the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines and other internationally recognized human rights.

SECTION 15. Justice System, Conflict Resolution Institutions, and Peace Building Processes. — The ICCs/IPs shall have the right to use their own commonly accepted justice systems, conflict resolution institutions, peace building processes or mechanisms and other customary laws and practices within their respective communities and as may be compatible with the national legal system and with internationally recognized human rights.

SECTION 16. Right to Participate in Decision-Making. — ICCs/IPs have the right to participate fully, if they so choose, at all levels of decision-making in matters which may affect their rights, lives and destinies through procedures determined by them as well as to maintain and develop their own indigenous political structures. Consequently, the State shall ensure that the ICCs/IPs shall be given mandatory representation in policy-making bodies and other local legislative councils.

SECTION 17. Right to Determine and Decide Priorities for Development. — The ICCs/IPs shall have the right to determine and decide their own priorities for development affecting their lives, beliefs, institutions, spiritual well-being, and the lands they own, occupy or use. They shall participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of policies, plans and programs for national, regional and local development which may directly affect them.

SECTION 18. Tribal Barangays. — The ICCs/IPs living in contiguous areas or communities where they form the predominant population but which are located in municipalities, provinces or cities where they do not constitute the majority of the population, may form or constitute a separate barangay in accordance with the Local Government Code on the creation of tribal barangays.

SECTION 19. Role of Peoples Organizations. — The State shall recognize and respect the role of independent ICCs/IPs organizations to enable the ICCs/IPs to pursue and protect their legitimate and collective interests and aspirations through peaceful and lawful means.

SECTION 20. Means for Development/Empowerment of ICCs/IPs. — The Government shall establish the means for the full development/empowerment of the ICCs/IPs own institutions and initiatives and, where necessary, provide the resources needed therefore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gov.ph/1997/10/29/republic-act-no-8371/|title = |date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rights to Ancestral Domain ===
Chapter III, section 7 of the Republic Act No. 8371 of 1997 covers the 8 Rights to Ancestral Domain. This chapter focuses on the identification and protection of the entitlement of the Indigenous Cultural Communities (ICC), and the Indigenous Peoples (IPs) as the proper owners of their ancestral land. The following rights are listed below:

This was implemented in order to stop the historical injustices experienced by the IPs. Despite the implementation of the law since the year 1997, the IPs of the Philippines still persistently experience injustices. The IPs are struggling fighting for their rights because they feel like the government has continued to neglect them.

The main criticism concerning R.A. 8371 is that it is ambiguous. One of the issues it encountered was that it is inconsistent and conflicting with the Philippines’ constitution (2).

This has become the case because of the doctrine of ''jura regalia'', which means that "all lands of the public domain belong to the state" (2). The next problem encountered was that the ancestral domain rights’ legal characterisation as "private but communal" differentiated from the Philippines’ civil law's idea of co-ownership of real property. This meant that areas in ancestral domains is shared by the members of the community, but that does not mean that they are considered as co-owners of the said property according to the New Civil Code (2).

Section 57 of chapter VIII of the Republic Act No. 8371 of 1997 which states that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Natural resources within Ancestral Domains - The ICCs/IPs shall have priority rights in the harvesting, extraction, development or exploitation of any natural resources within the ancestral domain. A non-member of ICCs/IPs concerned may be allowed to take part in the development and utilization of the natural resources for a period of not exceeding twenty-five (25) years: provided, that a formal and written agreement is entered into with the ICCs/IPs concerned or that the community, pursuant to its own decision making process, has agreed to allow such operation: provided, finally, that the NCIP may exercise visitorial powers and take appropriate action to safeguard the rights of ICCs/IPs under the same contract (1).&lt;/blockquote&gt;is also viewed as problematic (2) because being given

the right to be prioritised in terms of development, exploitation, extraction, or harvesting of natural resources belonging in ancestral domains does not necessarily mean that an IP member is given the right of ownership of the said
natural resources (3). Section 57 does not really reject the jura regalia, also known as the Regalian Doctrine or the Doctrine of Discipline expressed in the 1935, 1973, and 1987 Philippine Constitutions (4). According to the constitutions mentioned, the Regalian Doctrine expresses that "all lands of the public domain, as well as all natural resources enumerated therein, whether private or public land, belong to the State." (4). Most argue that the IPRA is flawed because it violates this (4). Instead of protecting the rights of the IPs, Section 57 strengthens argument that all natural resources found in ancestral domains belong to the State (3).

=== Social Justice and Human Rights ===
This chapter in the IPRA was written to recognize the indigenous people’ right to the same privileges and protections also afforded by the State to its citizens.  The law reemphasizes that all ICC/IPs are legally entitled to fundamental universal human rights and that the State should actively create an inclusive environment with this in mind.

Among these rights include;

==== Equal Protection and Non-discrimination of ICCs/IPs ====

Patterned after international standards set by the Charter of the United Nations, Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as the equal protection clause in the Philippine 1987 Constitution, this section places the State as duly responsible for the execution of the IPs’ human rights. The State is then called to acknowledge the ICCs/IPs position as a vulnerable group that have been historically excluded from socio-economic opportunities and to guarantee that the IPs enjoy equal protection by the law.

==== Rights During Armed Conflict ====

As signatory to the Geneva Conventions, the State is expected to respect and to ensure respect for the Conventions in all circumstances including local and international armed conflict. The State through the NCIP is empowered to ensure all civliians including IPs'/ICCs' safety in circumstances of emergency and conflict.

This being said, areas under Ancestral Domains and members of indigenous tribes require special regulation beyond that of the Convention as legally recognized IPs/ICCs are given the freedom to govern their territories by their own laws. Through the IPRA, the State must not;

a) Recruit children of the ICCs/IPs into the armed forces under any circumstance;

b) Conscript or recruit ICC/IP individuals against their will to the armed forces, and in particular for use against other indigenous peoples;

c) Relocate ICC/IP communities to special centers for military purposes;

d) Force ICC/IP communities, families or individuals to abandon their lands, territories, or means of subsistence; and

e) Require indigenous individuals to work for military purposes under discriminatory conditions.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

These provisions protects IP autonomy as well as requires the State to work alongside tribes through an integrated emergency program which includes relief and rehabilitation efforts for IP victims of armed violence. Special emphasis is placed the impact of armed conflict of indigenous children' mental well being and development in high risk conflict areas.

==== Freedom from Discrimination and Right to Equal Opportunity ====

==== Unlawful Acts Pertaining to Employment ====

==== Basic Services ====

The law guarantees indigenous peoples’ right to basic social services as provided by the State. As a vulnerable group, special attention is given for the "immediate, effective and continuing improvement of their economic and social conditions."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Examples of services that fit this provision include social security through the Republic of the Philippines Social Services System, housing, vocational training and employment support through various efforts of the Department of Social Welfare and Development as well as complete health coverage through the PhilHealth "No Balance Billing" from government hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PhilHealth to cover street children, PWDs, indigenous people – DOH - The Manila Times Online|url = http://www.manilatimes.net/breaking_news/philhealth-cover-street-children-pwds-indigenous-people-doh/|accessdate = 2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DSWD orients indigenous youths on their rights, privileges    {{!}} Department of Social Welfare and Development|url = http://www.dswd.gov.ph/2014/09/dswd-orients-indigenous-youths-on-their-rights-privileges-2/|website = www.dswd.gov.ph|accessdate = 2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women, Children and Youth ====

The law also emphasizes that these rights are also to be afforded to indigenous women and children. The provisions should not result in "the diminution of rights and privileges already recognized and afforded to these groups under existing laws of general application."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The government through NCIP must provide support to organizations which are geared towards empowering women and the youth to involve themselves in community/nation building.

In accordance to the customary laws of each tribe, the government must provide mechanisms that facilitate deeper understanding of indigenous culture for women and youth while their human dignity. The law ensures the full realization of women's and youth rights but requires all mechanisms and programs to be culturally sensitive and relevant to the ICCs/IPs needs.

An example of the programs geared towards the execution of this particular provision in the IPRA is the culturally sensitive day-care program for both IP children and their mothers which NCIP mentions in its first administrative order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ph/ph083en.pdf|url = http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ph/ph083en.pdf|website = www.wipo.int|accessdate = 2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cultural Integrity ====
Attempts to implement these rights regarding cultural integrity are most recently captured by the celebration of National Indigenous People's Month on October to November 2014. This was said to be the biggest gathering of Philippine indigenous peoples by far. Headed by the chairman of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), Felipe M. De Leon, Jr., showcased were the traditional cuisines, rituals, musical performances and other elements of culture. This gave way for indigenous peoples to interact and learn from one another's culture. It was held in three different venues, from Oct. 22 to 23 at the Baguio Convention Center in Baguio City in Luzon in expected attendees were from groups: Gaddang, Isinay, Tinggian, Itneg, Ibanag, Yogad, Itawit, Malaweg, Kasiguran, Ivatan, Itbayat, Bugkalot, Isnag, Kalinga, Ifugao, Ibaloy, Kankanaey,  Balangao, Bontok, Applai, Ilocano, Bolinao, Pangasinan, Tagalog, Sambal, Pampangan, Ayta, Agta, Mangyan, Palawani, Molbog, Jama Mapun, Tagbanua, Pala’wan, Agutaynen, Bicolano, Batak and Cuyunon; from Nov. 6 to 7 in Zamboanga City in Mindanao aimed to highlight the groups: Yakan, Subanen, Manobo, Higaonon, Bagobo, Mandaya, Mansaka, B’laan, Sangir, Ata Manobo, T’boli, Teduray, Arumanen, Mamanwa, Maranao, Magindanao, Iranun and Tausug and from Nov. 10 to 11 in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental in Visayas for the groups: Ati, Panay Bukidnon, Waray, Abaknon, Hiligaynon and Cebuano. It was organized by the Subcommission of Cultural Communities and Traditional Arts, a subcommission of the NCCA, along with the local governments, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations and private companies with the theme of "Katutubong Filipino para sa Kalikasan at Kapayapaan" ["Native Filipinos for Nature and Peace"].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A celebration of Philippine indigenous cultures|url = http://www.tribune.net.ph/life-style/a-celebration-of-philippine-indigenous-cultures|accessdate = 2015-07-06|first = Roel|last = Editor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related International Legislation on IP Rights ==
The United Nations acknowledges worldwide the rights of the indigenous people. The article on the UN [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] is recognized in the international sphere and was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly during its 61st session at UN Headquarters in New York City on 13 September 2007.

The Declaration is structured as a United Nations resolution, "with 23 preambular clauses and 46 articles concerning the collective and individual rights of the indigenous peoples in different parts of the world including protection of their cultural heritage and manifestations of their cultures including human and genetic resources."

The Philippines did not immediately support the draft. It abstained when the first votes were called, despite the existence of the Indigenous People's Rights Act of 1997. The Department of Justice and the Office of the Solicitor General expressed their opposition to the adoption, as they still had to study whether this was consistent with the Philippine Constitution. Furthermore, the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples, which was the representative organization of the Philippine IPs did not endorse it at first. However, after reviewing the declaration for many times, the Philippines supported and voted a yes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and Programme of the Second International Decade of the World's Indigenous People|last = |first = |publisher = Tebtebba Foundation|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Baguio City|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, the final result of the votes for the passing of the charter resulted to 143 yes votes, 4 no votes (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and U.S.) and 11 abstentions.

== Enforcement of IPRA ==

On October 2008, the Lumads (an indigenous group) organized a conference in Naga, Zamboanga Sibugay involving several indigenous people groups. In this summit, the indigenous people groups questioned the utility of IPRA in protecting their rights described in the IPRA. In this summit, the indigenous people groups discussed the instances the Philippine Law hindered their rights promised by IPRA. Primarily, the inconsistencies lie in how the Philippine Law prohibited them from following their customs and traditions that is centered around the indigenous people's governance of their land.

For instance, they complained  that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) prohibits some of the IP farmers to hunt animals, and to cultivate lands ( i.e. the 53,262-hectare part of Mt. Malindang )covered by National Integrated Protected Areas (NIPA) program; thereby, cutting off their primary source of income and food for their family. In worst-case scenarios, the state outrightly utilizes its right of state to dispose public lands for activities such as mining, logging and installation of dams that infringe upon the IP's ancestral domains. And because of these instances of usurpation of ancestral domain to the IP such as wide coverage of the NIPA to the IP's ancestral domain and economic activities that require the state to exercise their right to dispose public lands, the IP's basic sources of income and food for their families are greatly affected.

The limitations and prohibitions extends not only to their basic needs but also prevents them from performing important rituals in their lives. This includes wedding ceremonies that are normally held without cost but costs around 50 to 500 pesos when NCIP officials conduct it that is burdensome to IPs who lack sources of funds.

== Organisations related to IPRA ==
Here are some of the organisations that support IRPA law and their functions:
* Asian Development Bank (ADB)- gives loan to government to create projects such as Cordillera Agricultural Resource Management (CHARM) that help the development of IP's. The CHARM project involves helping the IPs in Cordillera to develop the agricultural resource of IPs land. They also helped in project Mindanao Basic Education Development project to give poor some education
* International Labor Organization- made some conventions regarding IPs such as poverty program, regarding on how IPs can assert more control and development of their own lands, regarding steps on how can IPs protect and guarantee their right of ownership and possession, regarding the responsibilities of government to ensure the rights of IPs.
* Philippine Action for Intercultural Development- helped the IPs regarding community mapping, where they help IPs in legalizing the boundaries of their respective lands
* National Confederation of Indigenous Peoples - aims to unite the different IP rights organization to fight for their rights. Their past projects includes Ancestral Domain Sustainable Development Protection Plan (ADSDPP), demarcation of Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) on the ground in favor of the Ati in Boracay Island etc.&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt;
* Tribal Communities Association of the Philippine- provides legal assistance to IPs

== Gaps in the Law ==
'''Section 56''' of the Indigenous People’s Rights Act of 1997 or the IPRA Law states that ''“property rights within the ancestral domains already existing and/or vested upon effectivity of this Act, shall be recognized and respected.”'' This section is problematic as it means that any title before 1997 holds more weight than an ancestral claim. Scholars and pro-indigenous groups have criticized this section as it effectively destroys any ancestral land claim before 1997. Historians have pointed out that most indigenous groups in the Philippines have been in the archipelago prior to Spanish occupation in the 15th century. However, according to Section 56, since there is no proper documentation committed by the indigenous people prior to 1997, an indigenous group cannot claim any land that have been in non-inidgenous possession prior to 1997. This makes multi-national companies and local government units have the power to resist ancestral claims and use the IPRA Law itself to counter indigenous land claims, as testified in an ongoing Mangyan case since 2011, which evicted indigenous Mangyans from a claimed land they have been using for many years. In 2015, it was announced that the indigenous land shall be made into a sanitary landfill by the Puerto Galero local government unit, and that the Mangyans shall be relocated into a site near the landfill. All Mangyan-planted coconut trees on the landfill site shall be chopped down by the government and the local government unit shall compensate only 100 pesos (approximately 2 US dollars) each to the Mangyans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/specialreports/490838/48-mangyan-families-in-puerto-galera-may-lose-homes-to-landfill/story/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Canadian politics}}
An '''interim leader''', in [[Politics of Canada|Canadian politics]], is a party leader appointed by the party's legislative caucus or the party's executive to temporarily act as leader when a gap occurs between the resignation or death of a party leader and the election of their formal successor. Usually a party leader retains the leadership until a successor is formally chosen — however, in some situations this is not possible, and an interim leader is thus appointed by the party's caucus or the party executive. An interim leader may also be appointed while a leader is on a leave of absence due to poor health or some other reason, and then relinquish the position upon the leader's return.

An interim leader has all the rights and responsibilities of an elected party leader, with the exception that the person does not have the discretion to choose the timing of their departure — an interim leader serves only until the party organizes and holds a [[leadership convention]]. By virtue of lacking a [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] from the party membership, however, an interim leader is not generally seen as possessing the authority to truly put his or her own ideological and organizational stamp on the party, and is thus effectively limited to a [[caretaker government|caretaker]] role in most cases.

There have been a number of instances where instead of a competitive leadership race between multiple candidates, the leadership convention directly [[ratification|ratified]] the interim leader as the party's new permanent leader, but a convention must still take place in some form.

By convention, if a competitive leadership race between sitting members of the party's caucus is taking place, the interim leader should be a caucus member who is ''not'' standing as a candidate in the leadership race, so they do not gain unfair advantage in the contest. Generally, an interim leader may also be a candidate for the permanent leadership only if he or she has no other caucus colleagues competing for the leadership; with rare exceptions, this generally occurs only in special circumstances, such as a minor party whose interim leader is also its only caucus member in the legislature.

An interim leader may, if necessary, lead the party into an election, but by Canadian custom, an election is usually not called while one of the parties is in a leadership race.

An interim leader may also assume political roles that would be held by a permanent leader of their party. For instance, if a prime minister or a provincial premier dies in office or resigns suddenly, the interim leader chosen to succeed them also becomes interim prime minister or premier.

==Practice==
In most circumstances, a leader who has decided to step down gives extended notice, and a leadership convention is organized to choose their successor. The outgoing leader remains in the position for the duration of the leadership campaign, and then hands over power to the successor shortly after the convention.

However, sudden vacancies may occur for a variety of reasons.

===Death in office===
[[Wilfrid Laurier]] died in 1919, while holding the leadership of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]. [[Daniel Duncan McKenzie]] was selected as the party's interim leader, serving until [[Mackenzie King]] was selected as the party's leader later in the year.

[[Jack Layton]] initially took a leave of absence from the leadership of the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] in 2011 for [[cancer]] treatment, and [[Nycole Turmel]] was named the interim leader of the party; Layton died before his intended date of return to office, and Turmel continued as interim leader pending the results of the [[New Democratic Party leadership election, 2012|2012 leadership election]].

===Scandal===
[[Glen Clark]] was forced to resign the leadership of the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]], and the [[Premier of British Columbia|premiership]], after a criminal investigation against him was announced. He was succeeded by [[Dan Miller (Canadian politician)|Dan Miller]], who served until [[Ujjal Dosanjh]] won the resulting leadership convention.

===Creation of a new party===
In 2000, after the [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] was folded into the new [[Canadian Alliance]], [[Deborah Grey]] served as the party's interim leader until the party's first leadership convention selected [[Stockwell Day]]. Similarly, after the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives merged in 2003, Senator [[John Lynch-Staunton]] was named interim leader of the new [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] until the first leadership convention selected [[Stephen Harper]].

===Internal dissension===
In 1983, [[Joe Clark]] received only 66.9 per cent support in an internal leadership review process conducted by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]]. Feeling that he did not have sufficiently strong support within the party, he thus scheduled a leadership convention. Initially, he remained the party's leader in the meantime — however, as he was also standing as a candidate in the leadership process, he eventually stepped down and [[Erik Nielsen]] was installed as the party's interim leader.

In early 2002, Stockwell Day's leadership of the [[Canadian Alliance]] came under criticism due to party infighting. Like Clark, he thus announced a new leadership campaign in which he would reoffer as a candidate, and [[John Reynolds (Canada MP)|John Reynolds]] became the party's interim leader.

===Leader defeated in an election===
In several cases, a party's leader has been defeated in his or her own riding in an election, and has resigned soon afterward. A resignation is not necessarily required in such a scenario, as other leaders in the same situation have retained the leadership until they were able to run in a [[by-election]]. However, for personal or political reasons some leaders have opted to immediately resign the leadership instead.

[[Andy Brandt]] became interim leader of the [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party]] following the party's defeat in the [[Ontario general election, 1987|1987 provincial election]], in which leader [[Larry Grossman (politician)|Larry Grossman]] lost his own seat. He served until 1990, when he was succeeded by [[Mike Harris]] following a leadership convention.

[[Jean Charest]] became interim leader of the federal [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] following the party's defeat in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 election]], in which [[Kim Campbell]] lost her own seat. At the next leadership convention in 1995, Charest was acclaimed to the full leadership of the party. Additionally, having subsequently become leader of the [[Quebec Liberal Party]], Charest resigned as leader following the party's defeat in the [[Quebec general election, 2012|2012 provincial election]], in which he lost his seat. As a result, [[Jean-Marc Fournier]] was named interim leader.

[[Joy MacPhail]] served as interim leader of the [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia]] from 2001 to 2003, following the party's defeat in the [[British Columbia general election, 2001|2001 provincial election]], in which [[Ujjal Dosanjh]] lost his seat. She served until [[Carole James]] was selected as the party's new leader in 2003.

[[John Tory]] was defeated in the [[Ontario general election, 2007|2007 Ontario election]], in which he ran in a different seat than the one where he was an incumbent. He stayed on as leader, despite facing some internal criticism — notably, a leadership review in 2008 gave him just 66.9 per cent support,&lt;ref name=canadianpress23feb2008&gt;[http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5ins3OgMvyNcaSGRZ_jCZ5zsk-81w "Conservative Leader John Tory to remain after 67 per cent in leadership vote"] &amp;mdash; Canadian Press, February 23, 2008. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; the very same result which [[Joe Clark]] had deemed ''not'' sufficient to justify staying on as leader of the federal Progressive Conservatives in 1983. [[Bob Runciman]] served as interim parliamentary leader, but Tory retained the actual leadership of the party. Tory eventually resigned in 2009, after losing a by-election in [[Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock (provincial electoral district)|Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock]], and Runciman became the party's interim leader.

[[Bob Rae]] was named interim leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] following the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 election]], in which his party's previous leader, [[Michael Ignatieff]], was defeated in his own riding.

===Internal disorganization===
In one case, [[Ontario Liberal Party]] interim leader [[W.E.N. Sinclair]] led his party through two consecutive elections in 1926 and 1929. He was interim leader from 1923 to 1930 since, due to the party's state of disorganization, there was no leadership convention held in that period to choose a successor to [[Wellington Hay]]. When a convention was finally held, Sinclair drew little support and withdrew before balloting began. He was succeeded by future Premier [[Mitchell Hepburn]].

===Leader accepts another position===

Sometimes an outgoing leader decides to resign immediately in order to ensure party unity, because they have accepted an appointment or chosen to stand as a candidate for (or been elected to) another position.

Following the resignation of [[Daniel Johnson, Jr.|Daniel Johnson]] as leader of the [[Quebec Liberal Party]] in 1998, the prospect of [[Jean Charest]] becoming the party's new leader began to attract widespread public support. When Charest subsequently decided to stand as a candidate, he resigned as leader of the federal [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]], and [[Elsie Wayne]] became the party's interim leader.

Similarly, [[Thomas Laird Kennedy|Thomas Kennedy]] served as interim leader of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]] from 1948 to 1949, after [[George A. Drew|George Drew]] resigned to contest the leadership of the federal Progressive Conservatives.

===Leave of absence===
An interim leader, [[Nycole Turmel]] was appointed to lead the NDP on July 28, 2011, while [[Jack Layton]] was on a medical leave of absence to fight cancer. She continued in the position following Layton's death on August 22, 2011.

From November 1954 to February 1955 [[William Earl Rowe]] acted as interim [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] when Progressive Conservative leader [[George A. Drew]] was in poor health following an attack of [[meningitis]]. Drew returned but later fell ill again, and Rowe again became as interim leader of the opposition in August 1956. Drew resigned in September and Rowe remained interim opposition leader until December when [[John George Diefenbaker]] was elected party leader.

===Political circumstances===
Following the [[2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute]], [[Stéphane Dion]]'s continued leadership of the federal Liberals was felt to be an impediment to the party's popular support, but with a situation where the party had to be almost immediately prepared to either take over the government or face an election, many party members felt that the party did not have the time to go through a conventional leadership race. After some internal debate, leadership candidates [[Dominic LeBlanc]] and [[Bob Rae]] withdrew from the race, and the only remaining candidate, [[Michael Ignatieff]], was immediately named interim leader. His leadership was formally ratified at a party convention in May 2009.

===Personal circumstances===
[[Pam Barrett]] resigned the leadership of the [[Alberta New Democrats]] in 2000, but for health reasons she opted not to retain the leadership until her successor could be chosen, instead announcing that her resignation was effective immediately. [[Raj Pannu]] was named interim leader, and was then acclaimed leader at the subsequent convention. [[Brian Mason]], who succeeded Pannu to the leadership in 2004, also took the position of interim leader before securing the full leadership at convention.

[[Danny Williams (politician)|Danny Williams]] resigned the leadership of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador]], similarly choosing to step down immediately rather than serving until a leadership convention, and Deputy Premier [[Kathy Dunderdale]] was elevated to the interim leadership of the party and to the premiership.

==Interim parliamentary leaders==
In certain circumstances, a party may also have an interim [[parliamentary leader]] who is ''not'' officially the party's leader, particularly when the party leader is not a sitting member of the legislature. [[Herb Gray]] served as parliamentary leader of the Liberals following the selection of [[Jean Chrétien]] as leader in 1989, until Chrétien could run in a by-election to enter the House of Commons. Similarly, [[Bob Runciman]] served as parliamentary leader of the [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party]] following the [[Ontario general election, 2007|2007 election]], in which party leader [[John Tory]] lost his seat in the legislature. He became the party's full interim leader in 2009 after Tory was defeated in an attempt to re-enter the Legislative Assembly in a by-election.

[[Bill Graham (Canadian politician)|Bill Graham]] served as interim parliamentary leader of the Liberals in early 2006, while outgoing party leader [[Paul Martin]] was still sitting as an MP and retained the formal leadership of the party. After this situation created some media confusion over which man would lead the party into an election if one were to occur, Martin stepped down as party leader in March, and Graham assumed the full interim leadership until [[Stéphane Dion]] was selected as leader in December.

[[Louis Plamondon]] became interim parliamentary leader of the [[Bloc Québécois]] on June 2, 2011, at the beginning of the first session of the [[41st Canadian Parliament]], following the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]] and the defeat and resignation of BQ leader [[Gilles Duceppe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Plamondon nommé chef parlementaire par intérim du Bloc Québécois |url=http://www.blocquebecois.org/bloc.aspx?bloc=b9ce5ece-2021-43c3-a58b-bea951e2c974 |publisher=Bloc Quebecois |accessdate=August 23, 2011 |date=June 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829173021/http://www.blocquebecois.org/Bloc.aspx?bloc=b9ce5ece-2021-43c3-a58b-bea951e2c974 |archivedate=August 29, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Vivian Barbot]] succeeded Duceppe as interim president of the BQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/Devastated+Bloc+loses+perks+previous+life/4878197/story.html |title=Devastated Bloc loses all the perks it had in previous life |first=PHILIP |last=AUTHIER |work=Montreal Gazette |date=June 2, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major James Coldwell]] became parliamentary leader of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] in October 1940, following the stroke and incapacitation of party leader [[J. S. Woodsworth]], who retained the title of "honorary president" (leader). Coldwell was officially elected leader in July 1942, several months following Woodsworth's death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Party.aspx?Item=12edf43c-e2be-4849-be6c-87131590112e&amp;Language=E&amp;MenuID=Lists.Party.aspx&amp;MenuQuery=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parl.gc.ca%2Fparlinfo%2FLists%2FParty.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}

The '''Kappeyne van de Coppello cabinet''' was the [[cabinet of the Netherlands]] from 3 November 1877 until 20 August 1879. The cabinet was formed by [[Independent politician|Independent Liberals]] after the [[Dutch general election, 1877|election of 1877]]. The [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] cabinet was a [[minority government]] in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]. [[Independent politician|Independent Classical Liberal]] [[Jan Kappeyne van de Coppello]] was [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4517">'''Labor and Agrarian Party''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Partido Laborista Agrario'', PALA) was a [[Panama]]nian right-of-center [[political party]], founded in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Contemporary Politics of Central America and the Caribbean. Gunson, Phil.New York, NY: Academic Reference Division, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991. Pp. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PALA supported the [[Marco Aurelio Robles]] administration in 1964-1968. In 1968 it allied with the [[People's Alliance (Panama)|People's Alliance]] (ADP) and its candidate [[David Samudio Ávila]].

The PALA survived the period of suspension under [[Omar Torrijos]] (1969–1979) and re-registered on 2 May 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribunal-electoral.gob.pa/elecciones/partidos-pol/partidos_desap.html Electoral Tribunal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119092857/http://www.tribunal-electoral.gob.pa/elecciones/partidos-pol/partidos_desap.html |date=2010-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
“''[[Azael Vargas]] (former Minister of Agriculture, Commerce and Industry), who claimed that the Labor and Agrarian Party had been hijacked, split with it to found the Authentic Labor and Agrarian Party. He then joined with industrialist [[Carlos Eleta Almaran]], scion of one of the "20 families', to found the National Renovation Movement (MNR), which in 1982 changed its name to the Conservative Party. An attempt to join forces with the [[Republican Party (Panama)|Republican Party]] (PR) to form the Conservative Republican Party was frustrated by the Electoral Tribunal, and Vargas and Eleta then went on to form PALA. The party mounted an expensive publicity drive and was accused of fraudulently boosting its membership figures''”.
&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Contemporary Politics of Central America and the Caribbean. Gunson, Phil.New York, NY: Academic Reference Division, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991. Pp. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Electoral Tribunal registered the PALA with 35000 members. [[Arnulfo Arias Madrid]] accuse PALA of fraud in obtaining their membership.
&lt;ref&gt;Inforpress Central America report, V. 10. Inforpress Centroamericana. 1983. Pp. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

“''Despite its name, and its use of the spade as its symbol, it is extremely conservative and hostile to organized labour. With backers among Panama's wealthy elite, PALA initially supported the presidential aspirations of National Guard chief Gen. [[Rubén Darío Paredes]] in 1984.''”&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Contemporary Politics of Central America and the Caribbean. Gunson, Phil.New York, NY: Academic Reference Division, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991. Pp. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;
The PALA eventually dropped him as a candidate and hacked the [[National Democratic Union (Panama)|National Democratic Union]] (UNADE) and its candidate [[Nicolás Ardito Barletta]] in the 1984 election.
&lt;ref&gt;Political Parties of the Americas, 1980s to 1990s: Canada, Latin America, and the West Indies. Ed. by Charles D. Ameringer. Greenwood Press. 1992. Pp. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;

PALA became the second most important force within UNADE, but was weakened in 1987 by a power struggle in which [[Carlos Eleta Almaran]] was ousted as party president, apparently as part of a move by the defense forces to take greater control over the party.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Contemporary Politics of Central America and the Caribbean. Gunson, Phil.New York, NY: Academic Reference Division, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991. Pp. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was succeeded as party leader by Ramon Sieiro Murgas (General [[Manuel Noriega]]'s brother-in-law).
&lt;ref&gt;Political Handbook of the world, 1993. New York, 1993. Pp. 637.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 it allied with the [[National Liberation Coalition]] (COLINA) and its candidate [[Carlos Duque]], PALA was expected to be allocated 1 seat in the post-US invasion legislature in 1989.
It joined the [[United People Alliance (Panama)|United People Alliance]] (APU) coalition behind official candidate [[Ernesto Pérez Balladares]] in the [[Panamanian general election, 1994]].

The PALA was abolished by the Electoral Tribunal on 15 September 1994.

The '''League Against Cruel Sports''' is an animal welfare charity that [[civil society campaign|campaigns]] against sports such as [[bullfighting]], [[fox hunting]] and [[hare coursing]]. It also campaigns to ban the manufacture, sale and use of [[Animal trapping|snares]], and for an end to [[greyhound racing]], commercial [[Game (food)|game shooting]] and [[trophy hunting]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070111023047/http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1236 ''League Campaigns''] League Against Cruel Sports, Retrieved 28/09/07&lt;/ref&gt; Famous supporters include [[comedian]] [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Jo Brand]], [[John Bishop]], Sir [[David Jason]], and [[Gemma Atkinson]].

The current president is naturalist [[Bill Oddie]] OBE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/content/347/Board-of-Trustees|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; League Vice Presidents include: actor [[Annette Crosbie]] OBE, The Rt Hon [[Baroness Smith of Basildon]],  and actor [[Peter Egan]].

==History==

===Original charter===
In 1924, the league issued the following charter entitled "''What We Stand For''":&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/frames/fulldesc?inst_id=73&amp;coll_id=7242 Archives in London and the M25 area] Retrieved 28/03/08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070921101218/http://league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1539 Original declaration of principles] League Against Cruel Sports, Retrieved 28/03/08&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Our Principle''':  That it is iniquitous to inflict suffering, either directly or indirectly, upon sentient animals for the purpose of Sport.
*'''We Condemn''': [[fox hunting|Fox-hunting]], [[otter]]-hunting, [[deer hunting|stag-hunting]], [[beagling|hare-hunting]] and [[coursing|rabbit]] and [[hare coursing|hare-coursing]], because they are organized forms of [[cruelty to animals|cruelty]] for pleasure, and, therefore, prejudicial to the best interests of the State.
*'''We Support and Recommend''': All clean humane forms of Sport, such as [[football (soccer)|football]], [[cricket]], [[golf]], [[running]], [[human swimming|swimming]], [[scouting]], [[hill-climbing]], etc., etc.
*'''We Specially Recommend''': [[Drag hunting]] as a substitute to hunting animals and we appeal to Hunts to adopt it.  Also "hunting" Big Game with the Camera as Major Dugmore and others do.
*'''Blooding Children''': We protest against the insult offered in hunting circles, not only to the child-life of the nation but to the community in general, by smearing children's cheeks with blood from the brush or pads of a [[fox]] or other animal hunted to death, and we demand the cessation of this demoralizing custom.
We respectfully invite Religious, [[Education]], [[Social Welfare]], [[Humanitarian]] and any other allied bodies willing to participate, by passing resolutions towards this end, to co-operate with us to make our demand effective.

==Key campaigns==

===Hunting===
Despite the passing of the [[Hunting Act 2004|Hunting Act]] in 2004, there is still a very strong pro-hunt lobby which seeks to have the Hunting Act repealed. The league campaigns to ensure that the Hunting Act is preserved. The league’s ‘Keep Cruelty History’ campaign &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keepcrueltyhistory.com/home/|title="Keep Cruelty History website"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in September 2009 and focused on highlighting the position on the finding of local candidates at the following year's [[general election]].
The league runs a Wildlife Crimewatch service through which members of the public can report any suspicious activity which may be in breach of the Hunting Act or any other wildlife legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/content/687/Report-a-crime|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the public call the Wildlife Crimewatch line several times a day to report suspicious behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/news_detail.aspx?ID=48|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This information is logged and passed on to police where appropriate. The league also coordinates a network of volunteers who monitor and record the activities of hunts.

===Snaring===
[[Snare trap|Snares]] are thin wire hitches used to catch and choke the animal. The snares are set to trap any animal perceived to be a pest or threat. The design of a snare &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antisnaring.org.uk/snares_and_snaring.html|title="Types of snare"|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210155/http://www.antisnaring.org.uk/snares_and_snaring.html|archivedate=22 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that it may [[strangle]] its victim and can lead to extreme pain and suffering, or cause the animal to die instantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antisnaring.org.uk/assets/files/The_Case_for_a_Ban_on_Snares.pdf|title="The Case for a Ban on Snares by the National Federation of Badger Groups" p6|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916142413/http://www.antisnaring.org.uk/assets/files/The_Case_for_a_Ban_on_Snares.pdf|archivedate=16 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commonly used by gamekeepers to catch [[fox]]es, [[rabbit]]s and [[stoat]]s, many protected [[mammal]]s such as [[badger]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antisnaring.org.uk/news_wire/badger_cub_found_in_snare.html|title="Badger cub found in snare"|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[otter]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/4511053.stm|title=BBC NEWS - England - Cornwall - Otter in 'terrible' snare death|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  plus [[livestock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishspca.org/assets/0000/2593/Snaring_in_Scotland.pdf|title="Snaring in Scotland: A Scottish SPCA Survey of Suffering" p2-3|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617110400/http://www.scottishspca.org/assets/0000/2593/Snaring_in_Scotland.pdf|archivedate=17 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[pet|domestic pets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antisnaring.org.uk/news_wire/cat_maimed_in_illegal_trap.html|title="Cat maimed in illegal trap"|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are either caught, seriously injured or killed in snares. Despite being banned in most countries across [[Europe]], snaring is still legal in the [[United Kingdom]]. The League Against Cruel Sports believes that snaring is cruel, indiscriminate, and wholly unnecessary and calls for an end to the manufacture, sale and use of snares in the UK.

===Dog fighting===
Despite being made illegal in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1835, [[dog fighting]] has been gaining ground in some communities in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rspca.org.uk/servlet/Satellite?blobcol=urlblob&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=RSPCABlob&amp;blobwhere=1236788694832&amp;ssbinary=true "New RSPCA Figures Show Shocking Rise In Dog Fighting On Our Streets"]&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs are trained to be [[violent]] by being starved and beaten. Those that seem too weak or fail to show enough aggression are killed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aspca.org/fight-animal-cruelty/dog-fighting/dog-fighting-faq.html ASPCA Dog Fighting FAQ&lt;/ref&gt; If a dog they use for fighting does not die from their wounds, losing dogs may be [[electrocuted]], [[drowned]], or [[hanged]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/6962563.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Programmes - Panorama - Dog-Fighting Undercover|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The league campaigns to raise awareness of the prevalence of dog fighting in the UK. In April 2010, the league launched a new telephone line through which members of the public can report suspicious incidents that they think might be related to fighting dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/content.ASpx?CategoryID=299|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shooting===
Millions of [[game birds]] are shot every year. Over 35 million [[pheasants]] and 6.5 million [[partridges]] are reared for shooting in the UK each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/images/pdf/gamedrain.pdf"The|title=Game Drain, Animal Aid report" p2|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These birds are often reared in [[battery cage]]s, according to the league’s website. The league's website also states "the misery doesn't end there - all kinds of wildlife suffer at the hands of the shoot, in the name of predator control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/content.aspx?CategoryID=300|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/images/pdf/kfps.pdf|title=Robinson, Peter: "Pheasant Shooting in Britain: The Sport and the Industry in the 21st Century" p9|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112173009/http://animalaid.org.uk/images/pdf/kfps.pdf|archivedate=12 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league campaigns for the shooting industry to be brought within the scope of the animal Welfare Act. It also conducts investigations to highlight what it alleges is cruelty within the industry and highlights concerns about teaching children to kill for sport and recreation.

===Bullfighting===
The League Against Cruel Sports seeks a complete end to [[bullfighting]] anywhere in the world and [[Lobbying|lobbies]] regional and local [[governments]] to put an end to bullfighting internationally. The league discourages [[big business]]es from associating with or sponsoring bullfighting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/content.ASpx?CategoryID=337|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally raises awareness of the cruelty and suffering involved in bullfighting. The league also promotes the Worldwide Anti-Bullfighting Pledge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-activist.com/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=122&amp;ea.campaign.id=3429|title=League Against Cruel Sports|website=e-activist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which signatories pledge never to visit a bullfight anywhere in the world.

===Racing animals===
The League is now opposed to [[greyhound racing]] as it believes there is a much darker side to this sport, and attempts to regulate it to minimise cruelty have failed. Thousands of [[greyhounds]] go missing every year, many put down, others dispatched with a [[bullet]] to the head or a brick around the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sighthounds.org.uk/updocs/RacingGreyhounds_WorkingLurchers_Wales.pdf|title=Sighthound Welfare Trust - Working towards the end of abuse, neglect and exploitation suffered by sighthounds|website=www.sighthounds.org.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531214136/http://www.sighthounds.org.uk/updocs/RacingGreyhounds_WorkingLurchers_Wales.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league has campaigned for a number of changes such as; independent regulation of the greyhound racing industry; the set-up of one single regulatory authority tasked with establishing and enforcing welfare rules; and a compulsory [[Tax|levy]] from bookmakers to fund welfare improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/content.ASpx?CategoryID=344|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the league is calling for a phasing out of greyhound racing.

===Trophy hunting===
[[Trophy hunting]] is the stalking and killing of wild animals for sport. The league says this multimillion-pound international industry is causing an irreversible decline in some of the world's most [[threatened species]] and campaigns to see it abolished. The league focuses on exposing British travel companies who promote trophy hunting. The league has also conducted numerous investigations into trophy hunting around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/content.ASpx?CategoryID=342|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
*'''1923''' – The league began in [[Morden]], (now a suburb of [[London]]) after Henry Amos raised a protest against rabbit [[coursing]]; he was successful in motivating support and managed to achieve a ban. This encouraged him to organise opposition to other forms of [[blood sport]]s and so, along with Ernest Bell, he established the League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports. Although many blood sports such as [[Bull-baiting|bull]], [[Bear-baiting|bear]] and [[badger baiting]] and [[cock fighting]] had already been outlawed at the time, animal protection laws only applied to domestic and captive animals. With the [[RSPCA]] unwilling to take action against hunting, Amos and Bell identified a clear need for an organisation which would campaign against what it classified as cruel sports.
*'''1927''' – The organisation had 1000 members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071009175638/http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1636 ''1927: The League had 1000 members''] League Against Cruel Sports, Retrieved 28/09/07&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1932''' – Bell left the organisation due to a difference in tactics. He went on to found the National Society for the Abolition of Cruel Sports (NSACS).
*'''1948''' – Actress [[Yvonne Arnaud]] became the league's president until 1951.&lt;ref name = "Developing Campaigns"/&gt;
*'''1960''' – League patron, [[Sir Patrick Moore]], introduced an anti-hunting motion to the [[RSPCA]]'s AGM but it was defeated.&lt;ref name="Developing Campaigns"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071009175311/http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1637 ''Developing Campaigns''] League Against Cruel Sports, Retrieved 29/09/07&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1967''' – [[Donald Soper|Reverend Lord Donald Soper]] became president of the league, a position held for 30 years, until his death in 1997.
*'''1975''' – An anti-[[hare coursing]] Bill, supported by the league, passed through the House of Commons, but failed in the House of Lords.
*'''1978''' – The league helped establish legal protection for [[otter]]s, which numbers were declining, by making it illegal to kill them.
*'''1989''' – As part of a "Safe Setts" campaign, the league joined forces with the [[RSPCA]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], [[Royal Society for Nature Conservation|RSNC]] and [[Badger Trust|NFBG]] to push for further protection for [[badgers]]. The previous legislation covered the actual animals, but not the setts, which were said to be still being destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071009175434/http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1638 ''Legislative Victories''] League Against Cruel Sports, Retrieved 02/11/07&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999 the league appointed Douglas Batchelor as chief executive, with a mandate to modernize the organisation and achieve the long sought after legislation on hunting and coursing for sport. 
Douglas Bachelor's background was in farms and estate management, business consultancy and IT systems and services for agriculture. The League Committee decision to bring in rural issue and countryside management experience to the campaign proved crucial in the run up to the eventual passage of legislation on hunting and coursing in Scotland and in England and wales.

The league worked with the SSPCA (the Scottish Society for the Protection of animals) in Scotland together with IFAW, (the International Fund for Animal welfare) on assisting MSPs to bring forward a Private Members Bill banning hunting and Coursing in Scotland for sport. The bill became an Act in 2002.

The league worked with the RSPCA (the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals) and with IFAW in England and Wales to help secure the passage of the Hunting Act through Parliament in 2004. The campaign was contested throughout by the Countryside Alliance and the Middle way Group who challenged it at every opportunity in Parliament, in the House of Lords and in Court, losing on each occasion.

*'''2005''' – With the commencement of the [[Hunting Act 2004|Hunting Act]], [[hare coursing]], [[fox hunting]], [[deer hunting]], and hare hunting with dogs became illegal in England and Wales.  "We are delighted that 80 years of peaceful, legal campaigning has paid off and that hunters will not be permitted to inflict suffering on wild mammals for their entertainment," a spokesman for the League Against Cruel Sports told BBC News.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4275753.stm ''Ban on hunting comes into force''] [[BBC]], Retrieved 05/03/08&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2006''' – A huntsman with the Exmoor Foxhounds, was found guilty of illegal hunting foxes with dogs in a [[private prosecution]] taken out by the league. (In 2009, the huntsman's appeal was upheld by the High Court, and the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to contest that ruling.) The league continued to monitor hunts so that evidence of law breaking could be brought before the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/5245458.stm ''Huntsman guilty of breaking ban''] [[BBC]].

*'''2009''' – announced a new campaign against dog fighting, amidst news reports that there is an increase in dog fighting in London.
*'''2010''' – the league rebrands and launches a new image and new logo "to better equip [it] for the campaigning challenges ahead."
*'''2011''' - Joe Duckworth was appointed chief executive following Douglas Batchelor's retirement. Joe, who has a long and distinguished background in public services, was appointed through an open recruitment and selection process.
*'''2014''' The league celebrates 90 years of campaigning against cruelty to animals in the name of sport.

==Sanctuaries==
The league began buying land in 1959 to provide a [[Nature reserve|safe haven]] for hunted animals. Concentrated around [[Exmoor]] and the [[Quantock Hills]] in the West Country, the league at one time owned around 40 wildlife reserves, the first of which it set up at Baronsdown, near [[Dulverton]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070112221256/http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1618 ''League Sanctuaries''] League Against Cruel Sports, Retrieved 28/03/08&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, they faced accusations by hunt supporters and the British Deer Society of poor practice in [[wildlife management]].&lt;ref name="BDS report"/&gt; A league spokesman said: "With its close links to field sports organizations, it comes as no surprise to the League that the BDS has chosen at the behest of its members to attack an organization that does not support their principle of management by killing."&lt;ref name = "BDS report"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/12/01/ndeer01.xml ''Deer society presses for inquiry into sanctuary''] Telegraph, Retrieved 02/11/07&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the league conceded that some of the Baronsdown [[red deer|deer]] were infected with [[bovine tuberculosis]] and agreed to stop feeding the deer herd in winter to decrease overall numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1720027.ece ''Stag stabbed to death at deer sanctuary''] The Times, Retrieved 02/11/07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent activities==
The league supported the [[Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002|Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act]], passed in 2002 by the [[Scottish Parliament]], and the [[Hunting Act 2004]]. Both laws make it illegal to chase a mammal with more than two dogs, but allow the use of two dogs (England) or a pack of dogs (Scotland) to flush an animal out of its lair to be shot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2002/20006--a.htm#3 ''Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002''] HMSO, Retrieved 28/03/08&lt;/ref&gt; Both laws allow the use of one terrier at a time below ground to flush a fox to be shot, if the owner of the terrier has written permission from the land owner or occupier to reduce fox populations in order to prevent or reducing serious damage to game birds or wild birds being kept on the land. The Hunting Act requires that the terrier is fitted with an electronic locator collar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basc.org.uk/media/terrier_code_final_form.pdf ''Code of practice for hunting with dogs below ground''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927165950/http://www.basc.org.uk/media/terrier_code_final_form.pdf |date=27 September 2006 }} Retrieved 28/03/08&lt;/ref&gt;

The league is currently campaigning against [[factory farming|commercial breeding]] of non-native [[pheasants|game birds]] for [[sport shooting|shooting]], and against hunts that it believes are continuing to hunt wild mammals contrary to the 2004 ban.

It also campaigns to extend [[hunting legislation]] from Scotland, England and Wales to [[Northern Ireland]]. Between 2006 and 2008, it successfully undertook private prosecutions against four hunt officials under the Hunting Act, because the police would not take action, and argued that this showed that the Hunting Act was clear in its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/hunt/Story/0,,1837783,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=1 ''Rethink ahead as huntsman is fined for breaking ban''] The Guardian, Retrieved 29/09/07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/6729983.stm ''Pair guilty of hunting with dogs''] [[BBC]], Retrieved 02/11/07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westpress.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=146238&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=146064&amp;contentPK=19479691&amp;folderPk=100268&amp;pNodeId=145795 ''Guilty plea after hunt pair do a deal with the League'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Western Daily Press, Retrieved 28/03/08&lt;/ref&gt; The first prosecution led to a conviction, but this was overturned on appeal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/7121482.stm ''Huntsman conviction appeal upheld''] [[BBC]], Retrieved 13/03/08&lt;/ref&gt; and the second conviction was upheld in the Crown Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/6729983.stm ''Hunting duo appeal is turned down''] [[BBC]], Retrieved 02/11/07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In the late 1980s, the league's executive director, Richard Course, was fired from the league after he expressed views divergent from the league's mission.  He had begun to spend some time with the mounted fox hunts as an outgrowth of his work. After a period of time talking with professional wildlife managers and hunt supporters, he concluded that: "I find it repugnant that some people will kill another living creature for recreational purposes" but said that the dogs easily outpace the fox within a minute or two and kill it within a second or two and that how the fox is located is "totally irrelevant" to animal welfare considerations. Richard Course has since denied that he supported hunting as a humane method of culling foxes. James Barrington, an ex-hunt saboteur, then assumed Course's position within the league.  Barrington later resigned, stating that he concluded that an absolute ban on hunting was not in the best interests of animal welfare; he later joined the [[Countryside Alliance]] as an animal welfare consultant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countryside-alliance.org.uk/hunting-campaigns/hunting-events/ex-anti%11hunt-chief-joins-alliance/ Ex anti-hunt chief joins Alliance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220065504/http://www.countryside-alliance.org.uk/hunting-campaigns/hunting-events/ex-anti%11hunt-chief-joins-alliance/ |date=20 February 2009 }} Countryside Alliance, Retrieved 09/03/09&lt;/ref&gt; Barrington admits that he did not fully understand hunting and therefore could not fully condemn it.

==Political links==

The league as a charity is [[Political neutrality|politically neutral]]. Complaints from opponents attacking the league's neutrality have all been dismissed by the [[Charity Commission]]. Several League staff have previously had political links. Former Chief Executive Joe Duckworth is a former trade union leader. Former CEO Douglas Batchelor was at one  time a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]].  Labour member and ex hunt saboteur [[Chris Williamson (politician)|Chris Williamson]] is a member of the board of trustees [https://web.archive.org/web/20131007031330/http://www.league.org.uk/content/347/Board-of-Trustees League Against Cruel Sports (2013) Board of Trustees], whilst several other board members are [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] members. Lorraine Platt, organizer of 'Conservatives Against Fox Hunting', is a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Vice-Presidents include Labour politicians [[Robert Evans (London politician)|Robert Evans]] and [[Kerry McCarthy]].

There are and have been throughout recorded history a great many [[Monarchy|monarchies]] in the world. 
[[Tribal kingship]] and [[Chiefdom]]s have been the most widespread form of social organisation from the [[Neolithic]], and the predominance of monarchies has declined only with the rise of [[Republicanism]] in the modern era.

A monarchical form of government can be combined with many different kinds of political and economic systems, from [[absolute monarchy]] to [[constitutional monarchy]] and from a [[market economy]] to a [[planned economy]]. Some examples for certain forms of monarchy are:

''Extant monarchies are listed in '''bold type'''.''

==Enlightenment and later==
[[File:Monarchies.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|Dates of the latest abolitions of monarchies in [[Europe]] and the territories nearby. A green rectangle indicates that the monarchy was restored afterwards and is currently functioning. If a country has no date, it means that either it has never had a monarchical government (e.g. [[Switzerland]]) or it has been functioning throughout the country's modern history (e.g. [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]]). Note that the dates do not necessarily mark the end of the national independent monarchy but the territory it covered (e.g. [[Ukraine]]).]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13999">The '''[[papal tiara]]''' is the [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] worn by popes of the Catholic Church for centuries, until 1978 when Pope John Paul I declined a [[papal coronation|coronation]], opting instead for an inauguration. The tiara is still used as a symbol of the papacy. It features on the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Holy See]] and of the [[Vatican City State]], though not on the pope's personal coat of arms since [[Pope Benedict XVI]] replaced the tiara on his official coat of arms with a traditional bishop's mitre. A tiara is used to crown a  statue of Saint Peter in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] every year on his feast day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Holy See Press Office | accessdate = 30 August 2017 | language = es | title =Tiara papal | url = http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/insigne/triregno_sp.html | date=3 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popes commissioned tiaras from jewelers or received them as gifts, with a number remaining in the possession of the Holy See. In 1798, [[Roman Republic (18th century)|French troops occupied Rome]] and stole or destroyed all but one of the papal tiaras held by the Holy See. Since then popes have used or received as gifts more than twenty tiaras. Several were never worn by a pope, notably those presented as gifts since the last papal coronation in 1963.

| [[Napoleon Tiara]]
| 1804
| [[Napoleon I]] gifted a tiara to [[Pope Pius VII]], who presided at his [[Coronation of Napoleon I|coronation as emperor]] in December 1804. Manufactured by [[Henri Auguste]] and [[Marie-Etienne Nitot]] of the [[Chaumet|House of Chaumet]], its decoration celebrated that coronation and the [[Concordat of 1801]]. Some of its jewels and decoration came from tiaras taken by the troops of the [[French Directory]] in 1798. It was purposely made too small and too heavy to be worn. It was later modified and worn by [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX]] at his coronation in 1846&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= The United States Catholic Magazine and Monthly Review |title=Intelligence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhVLAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA454 |volume= 5 |issue=8 |date= August 1846 |page=454| accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to open the [[First Vatican Council]] in 1868.

The '''Lokiriama Peace Accord''' is a peace treaty between the [[Turkana people]] of [[Kenya]] and the Matheniko of [[Uganda]] signed in December 1973 as a commitment by both parties to peacefully co-exist. The accord derives its name from [[Lokiriama]], a remote town in [[Turkana District]], North Western Kenya that is inhabited by the Turkana. A symbolic monument for this accord is situated at Lokiriama on the Kenya – Uganda border. It is believed that elders from both Turkana and Matheniko buried instruments of conflict, honey, milk and traditional brew in a pit over which the monument was constructed.&lt;ref&gt; Intermediate Technology Development Group East Africa (2003), Peace Bulletin Newsletter &lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemoration of the accord ==

Celebrations to commemorate the accord and re-affirm the commitment of all parties to upholding its content are held every year. The date for commemorating the accord is not fixed and may sometimes fall in December, earlier or later. In 2011 for example, commemoration was held on [[International Day of Peace]] which falls on September 21 every year. In addition to the Turkana and Matheniko, the commemorations bring together the [[Toposa people]] and [[Didinga people]] of [[Southern Sudan]], other [[Karamojong people]] from Uganda and [[Nyangatom people|Nyangatom]] of [[Ethiopia]]. Commemorations are also graced with the presence of high-profile political and appointed leaders from all levels, including the [[central government]] for both Kenya and Uganda. Local and international [[civil society|civil society organizations]] also participate in the event often making contributions to meet various associated expenses such as media coverage, transportation of clan members and food for all attendees. The 2011 commemoration was attended by former Kenyan President [[Daniel Arap Moi]], [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentary members]], Ministers and high-profile civil servants from both Kenya and Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gurtong.net/ECM/Editorial/tabid/124/ctl/ArticleView/mid/519/articleId/5752/EES-Governor-Commemorates-Lokiriama-Peace-Accord-In-Kenya.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lê Văn Khôi revolt''' (1833–1835) was an important revolt in 19th century [[Vietnam]], in which southern Vietnamese, Vietnamese Catholics, [[Paris Foreign Missions Society|French Catholic missionaries]] and [[Hoa people|Chinese settlers]] under the leadership of [[Lê Văn Khôi]] opposed the Imperial rule of [[Minh Mạng]].

==Origin==
The revolt was spurred by the prosecutions launched by Minh Mạng against southern factions which had opposed his rule and tended to be favourable to Christianity. In particular, Minh Mạng prosecuted [[Lê Văn Duyệt]], a former faithful general of Emperor [[Gia Long]], who had opposed his enthronement.&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Since Lê Văn Duyệt had already died in July 1832, his tomb was profaned and inscribed with the words "This is the place where the infamous Lê Văn Duyệt was punished".&lt;ref name=c192/&gt;

==Start of the revolt==
[[File:Prince Canh MEP.jpg|thumb|The Lê Văn Khôi revolt sought the re-establishment of the line of [[Prince Cảnh]] (here during his 1787 visit in Paris).]]
[[Lê Văn Khôi]], the adoptive son of general Lê Văn Duyệt, had also been imprisoned, but managed to escape on 10 May 1833.&lt;ref name=c192/&gt; Soon, numerous people joined the revolt, in the desire to avenge Lê Văn Duyệt and challenge the legitimacy of the [[Nguyễn dynasty]].&lt;ref name=w95/&gt;

===Catholic support===
Lê Văn Khôi declared himself in favour of the restoration of the line of [[Prince Cảnh]], the original heir to [[Gia Long]] according to the rule of [[primogeniture]], in the person of his remaining son An-hoa.&lt;ref name=m30/&gt; This choice was designed to obtain the support of Catholic missionaries and Vietnamese Catholics, who had supported the line of Prince Cảnh with Lê Văn Duyệt.&lt;ref name=m30/&gt; Lê Văn Khôi further promised to protect Catholicism.&lt;ref name=m30&gt;McLeod, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 1833, the rebels managed to take the [[Citadel of Saigon]] (''Thanh Phien-an'').&lt;ref name=m30/&gt; Lê Văn Khôi was able to conquer six provinces of [[Gia Dinh]] in the span of one month.&lt;ref name=c192&gt;Chapuis, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; The main actors of the revolt were Vietnamese Christians and Chinese settlers who had been suffering from the rule of Minh Mạng.&lt;ref name=w95/&gt;

===Siamese support===
As Minh Mạng raised an army to quell the rebellion, Lê Văn Khôi fortified himself into the Saigon fortress and asked for the help of the [[Thai people|Siamese]].&lt;ref name=c192/&gt; [[Rama III]], king of Siam, accepted the offer and sent troops to attack the Vietnamese provinces of [[Ha-tien]] and [[An-giang]] and Vietnamese imperial forces in [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref name=m30/&gt; The Siamese troops were accompanied by 2,000 Vietnamese Catholic troops under the command of Father [[Nguyen Van Tam (catholic priest)|Nguyen Van Tam]].&lt;ref name=m31/&gt; These Siamese and Vietnamese forces were repelled in summer 1834 by General [[Truong Minh Giang]].&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Lê Văn Khôi died in 1834, during the siege, and was succeeded by his 8-year-old son Le Van Cu.&lt;ref name=c192/&gt;

==Defeat and repression==

It took three years for Minh Mạng to quell the rebellion and the Siamese offensive. When the fortress of Phien An was invaded in September 1835,&lt;ref name=m30/&gt; 1,831 people were executed and buried in mass graves (now situated in [[3rd District]], Saigon).&lt;ref name=c192/&gt; Only six survivors were temporarily spared,&lt;ref name=Vo/&gt; among whom were Le Van Cu, but also the French missionary Father [[Joseph Marchand]], of the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]]. Marchand had apparently been supporting the cause of Lê Văn Khôi, and asked for the help of the Siamese army, through communications to his counterpart in Siam, [[Jean-Louis Taberd|Father Taberd]]. This revealed the strong Catholic involvement in the revolt.&lt;ref name=c192/&gt; Father Marchand was tortured and executed on 5 November 1835, as was the child Le Van Cu.&lt;ref name=c192/&gt;

The failure of the revolt had a disastrous effect on the Christian communities of Vietnam.&lt;ref name=w95&gt;Wook, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; New waves of persecutions against Christians followed, and demands were made to find and execute remaining missionaries.&lt;ref name=m31/&gt; Anti-Catholic edicts to this effect were issued by Minh Mạng in 1836 and 1838. In 1836–1837 six missionaries were executed: Ignacio Delgado, Dominico Henares, [[Jean-Charles Cornay]], José Fernández, [[François Jaccard]], and Bishop [[Pierre Borie]].&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LvvzlLf9dFEC&amp;pg=PA517&amp;dq=Fran%C3%A7ois-Isidore+Gagelin&amp;sig=ACfU3U2vAoHiwJK3OamylPqlNTLA2chwsA ''The Cambridge History of Christianity'', p. 517]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Western Sahara}}
The '''National Union of Sahrawi Women''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Unión Nacional de Mujeres Saharauis'', UNMS) is the [[women's wing]] of the '''[[Polisario Front]]'''. It was created in 1974, and claims to have 10,000 members, divided between the [[Refugee camps in Tindouf Province, Algeria|Sahrawi refugee camps]], the ''[[Free Zone (region)|Liberated territories]]'', the Moroccan-occupied part of [[Western Sahara]] and the ''Sahrawi diaspora'' (including for instance Spain, Mauritania or France).

==Organization==
The organization is mostly active in the [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] [[refugee camps]] in [[Tindouf]], [[Algeria]], where it is a powerful force within the POLISARIO and the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|Sahrawi republic]]. It is internationally active in organizing support for Sahrawi women and the Sahrawi cause, but also campaigns for women's rights within the exile community and in political decision-making. As a consequence of this, and of the special circumstances of the [[Western Sahara]] war years, the situation of Sahrawi women has improved noticeably. There are presently two women in the Sahrawi republic's government, the Minister of Culture '''Khadijah Hamdi''', and the Minister of Education '''Mariem Salek Hamada'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polisario.es/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=4 Datos Generales de la República Árabe Saharaui Democrática - Gobierno de la RASD tras el XII Congreso del Frente Polisario - Diciembre de 2007] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNMS is directed by a "National Committee" of 66 members, elected in the UNMS congress every 5 years. It is subdivided into several departments:
* Department of External Relations and Cooperation
* Department of Information and Culture
* Department of Administration and Organization
* Department of Occupied Towns and Emigration
* Department of Social Affairs
* Department of Health and Family Affairs
* Department of Formation
* Department of Education
* Department of Production
There are also departments for each [[Wilaya]].
The national committee is chaired by a Secretary General, elected also in the congresses, who is at the same time member of the Polisario Front national committee.

'''Keltoum Khayati''', a former secretary general of the UNMS, fled to Morocco and is defending the Moroccan position in the conflict.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} '''Fatma Mehdi Hassan''' has been secretary general since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mujeresaharauis.es/index.php/mujeres-saharauis/biograficas/fatma-mehdi Fatma Mehdi] Mujeresaharauis.es&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNMS has been a member of the [[Women's International Democratic Federation]] (WIDF)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdim-widf.com.br/indexingles/affiliateds/africa/repSaara.htm Union Nationale des Femmes Sahraouies]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[General Federation of Arab Women]] since 1977 and of the [[Pan-African Women's Organization]] (PAWO) since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arso.org/NUSW-1.htm National Union of Saharawi Women] ARSO.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
[[File:Saharako Emakumeen biltzarra - Congreso de la Union de Mujeres Saharauis - Saharauiak.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sectorial workshop during the 5th Congress of the "National Union of Sahrawi Women", at the [[Sahrawi refugee camps]] (April 6, 2007).]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3420">'''Pondage''' usually refers to the comparably small water storage behind the [[weir]] of a [[run-of-the-river hydroelectric]] power plant. Such a power plant has considerably less storage than the reservoirs of large dams and conventional hydroelectric stations which can store water for long periods such as a dry season or year. With pondage, water is usually stored during periods of low electricity demand and hours when the power plant is inactive, enabling its use as a [[peaking power plant]] in dry seasons and a [[base load power plant]] during wet seasons.&lt;ref name="Dwivedi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwivedi|first=A.K.

As a daily hydropeaking cylcle of a hydro power plant with pondage results in fast rising river levels downstream, environmental regulations often restrict the full use of the dispatchability as a [[Peaking_power_plant|peaker]]. 

==Calculation==
Because of the possibility of limited pondage, calculating its effect on power generation is important in determining how often the plant can be operated. The ''pondage factor'' is a rough index of the amount pondage needed when the stream flow is constant and the plant is operational during specific periods. It is calculated by the ratio of total inflow hours per week to the hours the power plant will be operated in that same period.&lt;ref name=raghun&gt;{{cite book|last=Raghunath|first=H.M.|title=Hydrology : principles, analysis, and design|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N1G5VSoRngC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288 |publisher=New Age International|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-224-1825-2|edition=Rev. 2nd |page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a river has an inflow for seven days a week and the plant operates for five of those days for eight hours:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{7 \times 24}{5 \times 8} = 4.2&lt;/math&gt;
24-hour inflows and plant operation would have a pondage factor of one. 

If power is used for twelve hours per day and during the inactive hours, relatively all inflows can be stored, then power can be doubled during active hours. In 12 hours there are 43,200 seconds and in {{Convert|1|acre.ft|m3|0|abbr=on}} there are {{Convert|43560|ft3|0|abbr=on}}. This gives an estimation and guide that for twelve hours of pondage, there must be as much storage available in the pond as cubic feet per section received.&lt;ref name="HH"/&gt;

In [[developmental economics]], the '''Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle''' (also called the '''Growth-Inequality-Poverty Triangle''' or '''GIP Triangle''') refers to the idea that a country's change in poverty can be fully determined by its change in income growth and income inequality.  According to the model, a development strategy must then also be based on income growth and income inequality.&lt;ref name = "ReferenceF"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gelaw|first=Fekadu|title=The Relationship between Poverty, Inequality, and Growth in the Rural Ethiopia: Micro Evidence|date=August 2009|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/51915/2/648,%20Fekadu%20G%20-%203.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourguignon|first=François|title=The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPGI/Resources/342674-1206111890151/15185_ICRIER_paper-final.pdf|date= February 2004|work=World Bank Website|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle model was created by [[François Bourguignon]], the former [[Chief Economist]] (2003-2007) of the [[World Bank]].

{{TOC limit|4}}

==Background==

The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle was originally introduced by Bourguignon in a paper presented at the Conference on Poverty, Inequality and Growth in Paris on November 13, 2003.  A modified version of the paper was presented at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations in New Delhi on February 4, 2004.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Economists working for international organizations like the World Bank use the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle to create poverty reduction strategies that include both steps to reduce inequality and stimulate growth.  Economists have used the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle to study poverty in both [[developing countries]] and [[developed countries]], including China, Egypt, India, Mexico, and Nigeria.&lt;ref name = "ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Growth-Inequality-Poverty Triangle Implication for the Development Strategy in Developing Countries|date=December 2004|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/84797-1104785060319/Cairo_ECES_1210final.pdf|work=Egyptian Center for Economic Studies|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; &lt;ref name = "ReferenceJ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Growth, Inequality, and Poverty in Nigeria|last=Aigbokhan|first=Ben E.|date=February 2008|url=http://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/publications/growthinequalitypoverty.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a study of the 138 countries over the period 2005 to 2010 found that the basic ideas of Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle hold and that both growth and inequality impact absolute poverty as Bourguignon described.&lt;ref name = "ReferenceI"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khan|first=Muhammad Azhar|last2=Khan|first2=Muhammad Zahir|last3=Zaman|first3=Khalid|last4=Hassan|first4=Umar|last5=Umar|first5=Sobia|title=Global estimates of growth–inequality–poverty (GIP) triangle: evidence from World Bank's classification countries|journal=Quality &amp; Quantity|volume=48|issue=5|pages=2631–2646|date=July 2013|doi=10.1007/s11135-013-9912-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==

[[File:Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle.png|Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle|left|thumb|x150px|''The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle, by [[François Bourguignon]].'']]

The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle can be drawn as a triangle with arrows pointing out of each corner.  At the top of the triangle is "absolute poverty."  This refers to the percent of the population below the income [[poverty line]].  At the bottom left of the triangle is "inequality" or "distribution."  This refers to differences in income across a population.  At the bottom right of the triangle is "growth."  This refers to the change in income for a population (for example, a change in [[GDP]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The arrows pointing out of "absolute poverty," "growth," and "inequality" in the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle represent cause and effect.  In the model, inequality and growth affect each other and both of them affect absolute poverty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Bourguignon defines the change in poverty as a function of growth, distribution, and changes in distribution: Δ poverty ≡ F(growth, distribution, Δ distribution). This equation assumes small changes in poverty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;  Bourguignon uses per capita income ([[GDP]] per capita) as the measure of growth and the [[Gini Index]] as the measure of inequality in his model.&lt;ref name = "ReferenceH"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lopez|first=J. Humberto|title=Pro-poor growth: a review of what we know (and of what we don't)|date=September 2004|url=http://www.eldis.org/vfile/upload/1/document/0708/DOC17880.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle model differs from previous models of poverty in that it looks at the interactions between growth and inequality, rather than considering the two separately.  On the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle, the bottom points of the triangle are boxed together under the heading of "development strategy," because Bourguignon believed the mix of policies to reduce poverty should depend on that relationship between growth and inequality.&lt;ref name = "ReferenceA"/&gt;

The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle model implies that reducing poverty requires a combination of country-wide policies focused on growth and country-wide policies focused on reducing inequality.  Development strategies that focus on only one of these miss opportunities to reduce absolute poverty.  The model describes that a change in inequality affects absolute poverty in two ways.  First, a change in relative poverty affects absolute poverty by immediately changing the number of people below the poverty line.  Second, a change in relative poverty changes the [[growth elasticity of poverty]]. A redistribution of income means more poverty reduction for a given amount of growth.  The consequence of this is that policies that focus only on growth without considering distribution limit poverty reduction in two ways.&lt;ref name = "ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grammy|first=Abbas|last2=Assane|first2=Djeto|title=The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle Hypothesis: An Empirical Examination|date=November 2006|url=http://www.econmodels.com/upload7282/a77f04149bbad14085ce30ac170e7da0.pdf|work=Journal of Policy Model|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inequality Matters|last=Kapoor|first=Radhicka|url=http://www.gdn.int/admin/uploads/editor/files/2013Conf_Papers/RadickaKapoor_ppt.pdf|work=ICRIER|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Economists theorize that for this reason sub-Saharan Africa and other less developed countries will not be able to meet poverty goals like the [[Millennium Development Goals]] through growth alone.&lt;ref name = "ReferenceK"&gt;{{cite web|last=Naschold|first=Felix|title=Inequality Briefing|url=http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/3876.pdf|date=March 2002|work=Overseas Development Institute|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Critics argue that the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle looks at aggregate concepts in a way that ignores the processes behind those concepts.  Critics say terms like "poverty," "inequality," and "growth" are too broad.  Instead, critics suggest that poverty should be traced back to individual behavior.&lt;ref name = "ReferenceG"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=Francisco H.G. |editor-last=Jefferson |editor-first=Philip N. |title=The Oxford Handbook of the Economics of Poverty|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=November 2012 |pages=427–462 |chapter=Distributions in Motion: Economic Growth, Inequality, and Poverty Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Developmental economists [[Abhijit Banerjee]] and [[Esther Duflo]] argue that cross-country data cannot be used to give any meaningful insight on topics like poverty and inequality.&lt;ref name = "ReferenceG"/&gt;

Critics also argue that the simplified nature of the model means that it misses factors that affect absolute poverty.  Poverty itself can be considered a barrier for economic growth, meaning that the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle would need to consider the effect of poverty on growth.&lt;ref name = "ReferenceI"/&gt;  Other economists argue that the triangle should include financial instability, crises, the business cycle, and their effects on poverty. Finally, many economists believe that there is a strong link between education, literacy rates, and poverty, and that the focus on decreasing poverty should lie in targeting these areas in addition to inequality and growth.&lt;ref name = "ReferenceE"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chemili|first=Leila|last2=Smida|first2=Mourir|title=Interaction between Poverty, Growth, and Inequality during the Crisis: A Panel Data Study|journal=International Journal of Economics and Finance|volume=5|issue=5|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijef/article/view/26709/0|date=May 2013|accessdate=4 November 2014|doi=10.5539/ijef.v5n5p120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who follow the PIP ideology are usually called ''independentistas'', ''pipiolos'', or sometimes just ''pro-independence activists''.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Carol J.; "Translating Laughter: Humor as a Special Challenge in Translating the Stories of [[Ana Lydia Vega]]"; The Journal of the Midwest [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA), Vol. 35, No. 2, Translating in and across Cultures (Autumn, 2002), pp. 75-87&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The party began as the electoral wing of the [[Puerto Rican independence movement]]. It is the largest of the independence parties, and the only one that is on the ballot during elections (other candidates must be added in by hand). In 1948, two years after being founded, the PIP gathered 10.2% of the votes in the island. In 1952, two years after an armed uprising of the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]], it obtained 19% of the votes, its highest electoral support ever, which made it the second electoral party on the island for a moment. In 1956 it took 12.4% of the votes; in 1960 3.1%; in 1964, 4%; in 1968, 3.5; in 1972, 5.4; in 1976, 5.7; in 1980, 5.4; in 1984, 3.6, and in 1988, 5.5. In 2004 it obtained 2.7% of the votes, and in 2008 it took 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Comisión estatal de elecciones de Puerto Rico|title=web site|work=www.ceepur.org.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foundation ===
The party was founded on October 20, 1946, by [[Gilberto Concepción de Gracia]] (1909–1968) and his colleague [[:es:Fernando Milán Suárez|Fernando Milán Suárez]].  &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independencia.net/ingles/aboutind.html&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; They felt the independence movement had been "betrayed" by the [[Popular Democratic Party (Puerto Rico)|Popular Democratic Party]], whose ultimate goal had originally been independence.

=== FBI surveillance of the party ===

In 2003, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the following about the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] publicly admitting it had directed "tremendously destructive" efforts against various organizations, including the Puerto Rican Independence Party:

{{quote|They include a 1961 directive from Mr. Hoover to seek information on 12 independence movement leaders, six of them operating in New York, "concerning their weaknesses, morals, criminal records, spouses, children, family life, educational qualifications and personal activities other than independence activities."
The instructions were given under the domestic surveillance program known as Cointelpro, which aimed at aggressively monitoring antiwar, leftist and other groups in the United States and disrupting them.

In the case of Puerto Rican independence groups, [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s 1961 memo refers to 'our efforts to disrupt their activities and compromise their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fernandez|first1=Ronald|title=The Disenchanted Island: Puerto Rico and the United States in the Twentieth Century|date=1 Jan 1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group,|page=213|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=JfJYJ9u4JP4C&amp;pg=PA213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars say the papers provide invaluable additions to the recorded history of Puerto Rico. "I expect that this will alter somewhat the analysis of why independence hasn't made it,' said [[Felix V. Matos Rodriguez|Félix V. Matos Rodríguez]], director of the center at Hunter{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. 'In the 1940s, independence was the second-largest political movement in the island, (after support for commonwealth status), and a real alternative. But it was criminalized.'

The existence of the FBI papers came to light during a [[US House of Representatives]] Appropriations Subcommittee hearing in 2000, when Representative [[Jose E. Serrano|José E. Serrano]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] questioned [[Louis J. Freeh]], then FBI director, on the issue. Freeh gave the first public acknowledgment of the federal government's Puerto Rican surveillance and offered a mea culpa.

'Your question goes back to a period, particularly in the 1960s, when the F.B.I. did operate a program that did tremendous destruction to many people, to the country and certainly to the F.B.I.,' Freeh said, according to transcripts of the hearing. Freeh said that he would make the files available 'and see if we can redress some of the egregious illegal action, maybe criminal action, that occurred in the past'.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Caribbean/FBI_PuertoRicanGroups.html|title=Decades of FBI Surveillance of Puerto Rican Groups by Mireya Navarro|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The FBI's surveillance of any person or organization advocating Puerto Rico's independence has been recognized by the FBI's top leadership.&lt;ref name="eldiariony.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldiariony.com/noticias/detail.aspx?section=25&amp;desc=Editorial&amp;id=1794932|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223002159/http://www.eldiariony.com/noticias/detail.aspx?section=25&amp;desc=Editorial&amp;id=1794932|title=El Diario/LA PRENSA OnLine  |archivedate=23 February 2008|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI's past surveillance of the pro-independence movement is detailed in 1.8 million documents, a fraction of which were released in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-secretfiles.net/organizations_info.html?detail=8|title=pr-secretfiles.net|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-secretfiles.net/index.html|title=pr-secretfiles.net|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then FBI Director [[Louis Freeh]] made an unprecedented admission to the effects that the FBI had engaged in egregious and illegal action from the 1930s to the 1990s, quite possibly involving the FBI in widespread crimes and violation of Constitutional rights against Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name="eldiariony.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; He stunned a congressional budget hearing by conceding that his agency had violated the civil rights of many Puerto Ricans over the years and had engaged in "egregious illegal action, maybe criminal action."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pKqVpqGVsJYC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94 America's Colony By Pedro A. Malavet, page 95] Accessed 14 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===
In 1971, the PIP gubernatorial candidate, [[Rubén Berríos]] led a protest against the [[US Navy]] in [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra]].&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, "Protesters on Culebra Scuffle With Marines"; pg. 13, January 19, 1971. At that time, he was found guilty of trespassing federal lands and incarcerated for three months at Fox River State Penitentiary (''see also:'' [[Navy-Culebra protests]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berrios Martinez, Ruben; "From a Puerto Rican Prison"; The New York Times, pg. 47, 28 April 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1972 elections, the PIP showed the largest growth in its history while running a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]], pro-worker, pro-poor campaign. One year later during a delegate assembly Rubén Berríos declared that the party was not presenting a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] platform and took the matter to the PIP's assembly which voted in favor of the party's current stance in favor of [[social democracy]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The Marxist–Leninist faction, called the "terceristas", split into several groups. The biggest of them went into the [[Popular Socialist Movement]], while the rest went into the [[Puerto Rican Socialist Party]].

=== 1990s ===
{{Social democracy sidebar}}

In 1999, PIP leaders, especially [[Rubén Berríos]], became involved in the [[Navy-Vieques protests]] started by many citizens of [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques]] against the presence of the [[US military]] in the island-[[Municipalities of Puerto Rico|municipality]] (''see also:'' [[Cause of Vieques]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=83278&amp;page=1 ABC News: ''Dozens of Puerto Rican Protesters Arrested - Marshals Raid Activists' Homes''; by Vilma Perez, 3 July 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 election===

During the 2008 elections, the PIP lost official recognition for the second time, obtaining 2.04% of the gubernatorial vote.  Loss of recognition was official on January 2, 2009.  The minimum vote percentage to keep official recognition is 3.0% as per the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico law. The party also lost both of its seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico|legislature]], where they had had one seat in each house.

In May 2009, the party submitted more than 100,000 signed petitions to the Puerto Rico's elections commission and regained legal status.&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=334663&amp;CategoryId=14092|title=Puerto Rican Independence Party Regains Legal Status|date=2009-15-2009|publisher=Latin American Herald Tribune|accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 election===
During the 2012 elections, the PIP lost official recognition for the third time, obtaining 2.5% of the gubernatorial vote. Loss of recognition will be official on January 2, 2013. The minimum vote percentage to keep official recognition is 3.0% as per the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vocero.com/pierde-su-franquicia-el-pip/|title=El Vocero de Puerto Rico|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130205200620/http://www.vocero.com/pierde-su-franquicia-el-pip/|archivedate=5 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 election===
For the 2016 election, [[María de Lourdes Santiago|Senator María de Lourdes Santiago]] was the party's nominee. She obtained 33,452 votes and came in fifth place, with 2.1% of the vote. Some of the senator's main policies for the election are outlined below&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univision.com/puerto-rico/wlii/noticias/politica-de-educacion/maria-de-lourdes-santiago-presenta-su-propuesta-educativa ''Politica de Educacion: María de Lourdes Santiago presenta su propuesta educativa.''] Inter News Services.

}}
The PIP cause receives moral support by international organizations. Examples of these are the [[Socialist International]] (the largest organization of political parties in the world), including fifteen political parties which are in power in Latin America. The [[government of Cuba]] also supports it, as well as the ex-president of [[Panama]], [[Martín Torrijos]], and a wide group of world-recognized writers and artists.&lt;ref&gt;"Panama requests Latin America to support Puerto Rican independence"; ''Dominican Today;'' 19 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Prominentes figuras de América Latina apoyan la independencia de Puerto Rico - Escritores y artistas declaran su adhesión a la Proclama de Panamá" www.independencia.net/topicos/panama/cpi_panama_nov06.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2007, the [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Gabriel García Márquez]] joined other figures such as [[Mario Benedetti]], [[Ernesto Sábato]], [[Thiago de Mello]], [[Eduardo Galeano]], [[Carlos Monsiváis]], [[Pablo Armando Fernández]], [[Jorge Enrique Adoum]], [[Pablo Milanés]], [[Luis Rafael Sánchez]], [[Mayra Montero]] and [[Ana Lydia Vega]], in supporting independence for Puerto Rico and joining the [[Latin American and Caribbean Congress in Solidarity with Puerto Rico's Independence]], which approved a resolution favoring the island's right to assert its independence, as ratified unanimously by political parties hailing from 22 countries in November 2006. García Márquez's push for the recognition of Puerto Rico's independence was obtained at the behest of the Puerto Rican Independence Party. His pledge for support to the [[Puerto Rican Independence Movement]] was part of a wider effort that emerged from the Latin American and Caribbean Congress in Solidarity with Puerto Rico's Independence.

==PIP anti-war mobilization and protests==
As reported in numerous media, the PIP's leadership and active members participated in [[anti-war]] protests and mobilization to resist the [[Iraq War]] and oppose the U.S. government's efforts to encourage Puerto Ricans to enlist in the [[U.S. Armed Forces]]. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' wrote in August 2007 that "on this island with a long tradition of military service, pro-independence advocates are tapping the territory's growing anti-Iraq war sentiment to revitalize their cause. As a result, 57 percent of Puerto Rico's 10th-, 11th- and 12th-graders, or their parents, have signed forms over the past year withholding contact information from the Pentagon. ... For five years, PIP has issued opt-out forms to about 120,000 students in Puerto Rico and encouraged them to sign—and independista activists expect this year to mark their most successful effort yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/17/AR2007081702175_pf.html|title=Recruiting For Iraq War Undercut in Puerto Rico|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article also quoted [[Juan Dalmau]], then-secretary general of the Puerto Rican Independence Party as saying: if the death of a Puerto Rican soldier is tragic, it's more tragic if that soldier has no say in that war [with Iraq]" and that he did not want the children of [[Puerto Rico]] to become "colonial cannon meat."

Another article in ''[[The Progressive]]'' also reported on PIP's anti-war activity. It was written three years earlier, in 2004, but it still noted that "some groups like the Puerto Rico Bar Association and the Independence Party have registered strong protests against the deployments. In an attempt to draw attention to Puerto Ricans' lack of elected representatives, even the usually pro-U.S. statehood party has raised concerns about the disproportionate body count suffered by islanders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progressive.org/media_898|title=Puerto Rican involvement in Iraq comes with no representation |work=The Progressive|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, it was reported that PIP, along with hundreds of other supporters of Puerto Rican independence "blocked the entrance to the U.S. Federal Courthouse here on Feb. 20 to denounce recent FBI raids against the homes and workplaces of ... supporters of Puerto Rican independence...and the growing repression by the FBI against the independence movement in general." This demonstration reportedly marked the beginning of PIP "campaign to get the FBI out of Puerto Rico."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workers.org/2006/world/puerto-rico-0302/|title=Puerto Rican Independence Party protests FBI attacks on activists and the|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PIP stance on Puerto Rico's economic crisis and taxation system==
During the 2005–2007 Puerto Rico economic crisis, the Puerto Rican Independence Party submitted various bills that would have taxed corporations making $1 million or more in annual net profits an extra ten percent above the average tax rate these corporations pay, which hovers around 5%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Cruz, José A.; "Puerto Rico's crisis highlights its colonial status"; ''People's Weekly World''. (National Edition). New York: Jun 17-Jun 23, 2006. Vol. 21, Iss. 3; pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The PNP and the PPD parties amended the bill, taxing the corporations the traditional lower rate.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Despite objections presented by the PIP, the PNP and PPD also allowed the companies to claim the additional tax as a credit on next year's bill, making the "tax", in effect, a one-year loan. Puerto Rico has been said "There is no place in the territorial limits of the United States that provides such an advantageous base for exporters. " Because of this, many US companies moved their headquarters and manufacturing facilities there. This is why the PNP and PPD believed the tax increase would exacerbate the problems&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offshore-manual.com/taxhavens/PuertoRico.html|title= — Offshore Manual - We walk the walk, and talk the talk! --|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Party symbol ==

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Red Rose (Socialism).svg|thumb|130px|left|The official symbol of the PIP's supranational-affiliation, the [[Socialist International]] (SI); the largest organization of political parties around the world, of which the PIP is a full-fledged member.]] --&gt;

[[Image:Flag of the Puerto Rican Independence Party.svg|thumb|250px|The PIP's symbol is a [[Scandinavia]]n white [[cross]] on a green [[flag]]; because of this and its commitment to protecting the environment and promoting [[sustainable development]], it is identified as the ''green'' party by both the voting public and ballots{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.]]

The flag's green color stands for the hope of becoming free, and the white cross stands for the sacrifice and commitment of the party with democracy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  The flag's design is based on the first [[Nationalism|national]] flag ever flown by Puerto Ricans, which is also the current flag of the municipality of [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]], location where the first relatively successful attempt of revolutionary insurgency in Puerto Rico, called [[Grito de Lares]], took place on September 23, 1868. The [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]] flag is, on the other hand, similar to that of the [[Dominican Republic]], since the Grito's mastermind, [[Ramón Emeterio Betances]], not only admired the Dominican pro-independence struggle, but was also half-Dominican himself. The party's flag is based on the [[Nordic Cross]] flag design. Nordic Cross flags, or [[Latin cross]] flags, are a common design in [[Scandinavia]] and other parts of the world, and in theory, the PIP's emblem belongs to this family of flags.

==Disfranchisement due to residence in Puerto Rico==

United States citizens residing in the [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|U.S. commonwealth]] of Puerto Rico do not hold the right to vote in U.S. presidential elections. Although Puerto Rican residents elect a [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico|Resident Commissioner]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]], that official may not participate in votes determining the final passage of legislation. Furthermore, Puerto Rico holds no representation of any kind in the [[United States Senate]].

Both the Puerto Rican Independence Party and the [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico]] officially oppose the island's political status quo and consider Puerto Rico's lack of federal representation to be disfranchisement. The remaining political organization, the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico|Popular Democratic Party]], is less active in its opposition of this case of disfranchisement but has officially stated that it favors fixing the remaining "deficits of democracy" that the [[Clinton administration|Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush administration]]s have publicly recognized in writing through Presidential Task Force Reports.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15459">[[File:Red flag.svg|thumb|250px|right|The plain red flag is often used at socialist or communist rallies, especially on [[International Workers' Day]].]]

In [[politics]], a '''red flag''' is predominantly a symbol of [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[Marxism]], [[trade unions]], [[left-wing politics]], and historically of [[anarchism]]; it has been associated with left-wing politics since the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99).&lt;ref name="Brink"&gt;Brink, Jan ten [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1402138296 ''See also Merthyr Rising''Robespierre and the Red Terror], 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; Socialists adopted the symbol during the [[Revolutions of 1848]] and it became a symbol of communism as a result of its use by the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871. The flags of several [[communist state]]s, including [[flag of the People's Republic of China|China]], [[Flag of Vietnam|Vietnam]] and the [[Soviet Union]], are explicitly based on the original red flag. The red flag is also used as a symbol by some [[democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] and [[social democracy|social democrats]], for example the [[League of Social Democrats]] of [[Hong Kong]], [[Socialist Party of France|French Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] used it until the late 1980s. It was the inspiration for the socialist anthem, ''[[The Red Flag (song)|The Red Flag]]''.

Lamartine said that the red flag represented revolutionary violence, and "has to be put down immediately after the fighting."]]
In the Middle Ages, ships in combat flew a long red streamer, called the Baucans, to signify a fight to the death.&lt;ref&gt;''Flags of the World'', "[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/vxt-dvb2.html#baucens Baucans (or Bauccedillian)]".&lt;/ref&gt; In one petition, a group of English sailors asserted that the Crown had no right to a share of the prize money earned from a Norman ship captured in 1293 because it had raised the Baucans.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, R.G., "Early Prize Jurisdiction and Prize Law in England" (1909)&lt;br&gt;Perrin, W.G. ''British Flags: Their Early History and Their Development at Sea; with an Account of the Origin of the Flag as a National Device'' (1922) p, 161.&lt;/ref&gt; (Raising this streamer may have been a relatively novel practice at this time, since the writers feel the need to explain it.) By the 17th century, the Baucans had evolved into a red flag, or "flag of defiance."&lt;ref&gt;'''1602''' Dekker Satirom. ''Wks.'' 1873 I. 233 What, dost summon a parlie, my little Drumsticke? tis too late: thou seest my red flag is hung out.&lt;br&gt;'''1666''' ''Lond. Gaz.'' No. 91/4 That the Red Flag was out, both Fleets in sight of each other, expecting every hour fit weather to Engage.&lt;br&gt;''Flags of the World'', "[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/vxt-dvf3.html#flagofdefiance Flag of Defiance]."&lt;/ref&gt; It was raised in cities and castles under siege to indicate that they would not surrender.&lt;ref&gt;"so the red flag of defiance was pulled down", Grant, James, ''[http://www.oldandnewedinburgh.co.uk/volume1/page60.html Cassell's Old and New Edinburgh]'', Vol. 1, (1882) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; "The red flag is a signal of defiance and battle," according to ''Chambers Cyclopedia'' (1727–41).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in "red flag," ''Oxford English Dictionary.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The red cap was a symbol of popular revolt in France going back to the [[Jacquerie]] of 1358. The color red become associated with patriotism early in the [[French Revolution]] due to the popularity of the [[Tricolour (flag)|Tricolour]] cockade, introduced in July 1789, and the [[Phrygian cap]], introduced in May 1790. A red flag was raised over the [[Champ-de-Mars]] in Paris on July 17, 1791 by [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]], commander of the National Guard, as a symbol of martial law, warning rioters to disperse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Carlyle]], ''[http://dickens.stanford.edu/archive/tale/print_issue10_gloss.html French Revolution]'', p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; As many as fifty anti-royalist protesters were killed in the fighting that followed.

Inverting the original symbolism, the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] protested this action by flying a red flag to honor the "martyrs' blood" of those who had been killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Flags of the World'', "[http://www.crwflags.com/FOTW/flags/fr_revol.html#red French Revolution]"&lt;/ref&gt; They created their own red flags to declare "the martial law of the people against the revolt of the court."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.marxists.org/archive/jaures/1901/history/aug-10-1792.htm Socialist History of the French Revolution]"&lt;/ref&gt;
The Jacobin Club ruled France during the [[Reign of Terror]] (1793–1794) and made the red flag an unofficial national emblem.&lt;ref name="Brink"/&gt; However, the earlier Tricolor never lost its official status and regained popularity under [[Napoleon]].

British sailors [[Nore mutiny|mutinied]] near the mouth of the [[River Thames]] in 1797 and hoisted a red flag on several ships. Two red flags soaked in calf's blood were flown by marchers in [[South Wales]] during the [[Merthyr Rising]] of 1831. It is claimed to be the first time that the red flag was waved as a banner of workers power. Along with the Newport Rising eight years later, it was one of the most serious violent outbreaks witnessed on mainland Britain.&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;Saunders, Bob, "[http://libcom.org/library/1831-merthyr-tydfil-uprising The Merthyr Rising 1831]"&lt;/ref&gt;  The red flags of Merthyr became a potent relic following the execution of early trade unionist [[Dic Penderyn]] (Richard Lewis) in August 1831, despite a public campaign to pardon him.

During the Mexican siege of the [[Alamo]] in March 1836, General [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana]] displayed a plain red flag (approx. 10 feet square) from the highest church tower in Bejar.  The meaning of this flag was not socialism: its meaning - directed to the Alamo defenders - meant "no surrender; no clemency." {{citation needed|date=July 2011}}
[[File:Flag of Colorado Party (Uruguay).svg|thumb|right|The flag of the [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]] during the [[Uruguayan Civil War]].]]

At much the same time, the Liberal "Colorados" in the [[Uruguayan Civil War]] used red flags. This prolonged struggle at the time got considerable attention and sympathy from Liberals and revolutionaries in Europe and it was in this war that [[Garibaldi]] first made a name for himself and that he was inspired to have his troops wear the famous [[Redshirts (Italy)|Red Shirts]].

During the [[Revolution of 1848 in France|1848 Revolution in France]], [[Socialists]] and radical republicans demanded that the red flag be adopted as France's national flag. Led by poet-politician [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], the government rejected the crowd's demand: "[T]he red flag that you have brought back here has done nothing but being trailed around the Champ-de-Mars in the people's blood in [17]91 and [17]93, whereas the Tricolore flag went round the world along with the name, the glory and the liberty of the homeland!"&lt;ref&gt;''Flags of the World'', "[http://www.crwflags.com/FOTW/flags/fr_secdr.html France]"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of the Soviet Union (1936-1955).svg|thumb|right|The [[flag of the Soviet Union]], adopted in 1923. This version was used until 1955, when the flag was modified slightly. It lost official status in 1991 when the Soviet Union dissolved.]]

The banner of the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 was red and it was at this time that the red flag became a symbol of communism.  The flag was flown by anarchists at a [[May Day]] rally for an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]] in [[Chicago]] in 1886. A bomb blast killed a policeman and the [[Haymarket Affair|Haymarket Eight]] were arrested and five were executed. This event, considered the beginning of the international labor movement, is still commemorated annually in many countries (although not in the U.S.) The red flag gained great popularity during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] of 1917.&lt;ref name="su flag"&gt;''Flags of the World'', "[http://www.crwflags.com/FOTW/flags/su.html Soviet]"&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet flag, with a hammer, a sickle and a star on a red background, was adopted in 1923.&lt;ref name="su flag"/&gt; Various Communist and socialist newspapers have used the name ''The Red Flag.'' In [[China]], both the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party]]-led [[Republic of China]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]-led [[People's Republic of China]] use a red field for their flags, a reference to their revolutionary origins.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In more recent times, [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties have gravitated away from the Red Flag as a symbol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} However, several European parties retain a "red square" symbol, including Germany's [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and the [[Party of European Socialists]]. The building to have had a red flag flying for the longest period of time and to still have one is the [[Victorian Trades Hall]] in Melbourne, Australia. The flag has been flying for over a century.

===Usage by anarchists===
Anarchists, as part of socialist movement, in 19th century also used red flag - it was one of first anarchist symbols. Usage of the red flag by anarchists disappeared after the [[October Revolution]], when red flags started to be associated only with communist parties and bureaucratic, reformist and authoritarian [[social democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cia.media.pl/symbole_ruchu_anarchistycznego |title=Barwy anarchistyczne: Skąd czarne i czarno-czerwone flagi? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2012-06-19 |website=cia.media.pl |publisher=Centrum Informacji Anarchistycznej |language=pl |trans-title=Anarchist colours: Where are black and black-red flags from? |access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The British Labour Party===

The red flag was the emblem of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from its inception until the [[Labour Party Conference]] of 1986 when it was replaced by a red [[rose]], itself a variant of the "Fist and Rose" then in wide use by left of center parties in Europe. The more floral red rose design has subsequently been adopted by a number of other socialist and social-democratic parties throughout Europe. Members of the party also sing the traditional anthem ''[[The Red Flag (song)|The Red Flag]]'' at the conclusion of the annual party conference. In February 2006 the ''Red Flag'' was sung in Parliament to mark the centenary of the Labour Party's founding. The flag was regularly flown above [[Sheffield Town Hall]] on [[May Day]] under [[David Blunkett]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] administration of [[Sheffield]] during the 1980s, leading to Sheffield being labelled the [[People's Republic of South Yorkshire]].

===Laws to ban red flags===
During the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] of 1919-20 in the United States, many states passed laws forbidding the display of red flags, including [[Minnesota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Oklahoma]],&lt;ref&gt;Zechariah Chafee, Jr., ''Freedom of Speech'' (NY: Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920), 180ff., Appendix V&lt;/ref&gt; and [[California]].  In ''[[Stromberg v. California]]'', the United States Supreme Court held that such laws are unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''Stromberg v. California'', 283 U.S. 359 (1931).&lt;/ref&gt;  The current [[flag of Oklahoma]] dates to this period and was adopted because of the association of the [[Flag of Oklahoma#History|first flag of Oklahoma]], a white star on a red background, with socialism.{{citation needed|date = June 2011}}

===Flag of Kuwait===
In the 19th century, [[Kuwait]] was using a [[Flag of Kuwait|red flag]], unintentionally virtually identical to the flag used by various revolutionary movements at the time. In 1899 Kuwait changed this flag.

==Communist/socialist Red Flag as name or title==
[[File:Order of Red Banner.png|thumb|[[Order of Red Banner]] of Soviet Union]]
It has been common to find streets, buildings, businesses and product brands named after the Red Flag in nominally socialist countries as a result of [[recuperation (politics)|recuperation]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} For example, a famous line of [[limousine]] cars manufactured by [[China FAW Group Corporation]] has the brand name of [[FAW Hongqi|Red Flag]].

'''Sarah Harrison''' is [[WikiLeaks]] section editor. She works with the WikiLeaks Legal Defense and is [[Julian Assange]]'s closest adviser.&lt;ref name="BI: Meet Sarah Harrison"/&gt; Harrison accompanied [[National Security Agency]] [[whistleblower]] [[Edward Snowden]] on a high-profile flight from Hong Kong to Moscow while he was sought by the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vogue.com/11122973/sarah-harrison-edward-snowden-wikileaks-nsa/|title=How a Snowdenista Kept the NSA Leaker Hidden in a Moscow Airport|last=Corbijn|first=Sara Corbett, Anton|newspaper=Vogue|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== WikiLeaks ==

As an intern at the Centre, she was assigned to [[Julian Assange]] before the [[Afghan War documents leak]].&lt;ref name="Guardian: escort"/&gt; After [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]] left WikiLeaks over a dispute with Assange, Harrison's role in the organisation increased, particularly with the embassy cable publication and Assange's legal fight against Swedish [[extradition]].&lt;ref name="Guardian: escort"/&gt; Harrison is a WikiLeaks section editor.&lt;ref name="BI: Meet Sarah Harrison"/&gt; She works with the WikiLeaks Legal Defense led by [[Baltasar Garzón]],&lt;ref name="IBT: travels to Moscow"/&gt; and is Julian Assange's closest adviser.&lt;ref name="BI: Meet Sarah Harrison"/&gt;

=== Edward Snowden ===

On 24 June 2013, WikiLeaks said that Harrison accompanied [[National Security Agency]] leaker [[Edward Snowden]] on a high-profile&lt;ref name="NYT: back in the game"/&gt; flight from Hong Kong to Moscow en route to [[political asylum]] from US extradition.&lt;ref name="IBT: travels to Moscow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BI: Meet Sarah Harrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian: escort"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT: back in the game"/&gt; Dominic Rushe of ''[[The Guardian]]'' observed that Harrison was a "strange choice" because of her lack of legal qualifications compared to other WikiLeaks staff, such as human rights lawyer [[Jennifer Robinson (lawyer)|Jennifer Robinson]].&lt;ref name="Guardian: escort"/&gt; At the time, she had been with the organisation for over two years.&lt;ref name="BI: Meet Sarah Harrison"/&gt;  On 1 August 2013, Harrison accompanied Snowden out of Moscow's [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] after he was granted a year of temporary asylum.&lt;ref name="BBC: leaves airport"/&gt;

In 2014, Harrison spoke about her support for WikiLeaks' endeavours saying "the greatest unaccountable power of today [is] the United States and our Western democracies."&lt;ref&gt;Berthold Stevens (2 July 2014), [http://www.dw.de/exposing-the-secrets-of-unaccountable-power/a-17753718 Exposing the secrets of unaccountable power] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison also works as acting director for [[Courage Foundation]], an organisation whose aim is providing support to whistleblowers all around the world, including [[Edward Snowden]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.couragefound.org/2015/04/courage-team-members-participate-in-reddit-ama/ Courage team members participate in Reddit AMA]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5776">'''Sean R. Garner''' is a physicist currently working on a diverse suite of projects for [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC), in San Francisco, CA.  Garner received his BA, Mathematics and BS, Physics from [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] in 1999, and completed his PhD in Physics in 2005 at [[Cornell University]]. His thesis was titled "Force-Gradient Detection of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance", and Prof. John A. Marohn was his Doctoral Advisor. He then spent 3 years as a Postdoctoral Fellow at [[Harvard University]], School of Engineering and Applied Sciences researching ultra-slow and stopped light in [[Bose-Einstein Condensate]]s with Prof. [[Lene Vestergaard Hau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marohn.chem.cornell.edu/Marohn%20Alumni.htm |title=Marohn Group Alumni}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Garner was the second author on the groundbreaking paper “Coherent control of optical information with matter wave dynamics,” which appeared on the cover of [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], and detailed the first experimental verification "that a slow light pulse can be stopped and stored in one Bose–Einstein condensate and subsequently revived from a totally different condensate, 160 m away; information is transferred through conversion of the optical pulse into a travelling matter wave."&lt;ref name="nature1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7128/abs/nature05493.html |title=Coherent control of optical information with matter wave dynamics | volume=445 | doi=10.1038/nature05493 |journal=Nature |pages=623–626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After completing his post-doctoral work,  Garner moved to [[California]], to take up the position of Area Manager of [[PARC (company)|PARC]] San Francisco Research Division in 2009.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parc.com/about/people/69/sean-garner.html |title=Sean Garner - PARC, a Xerox company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed him to undertake further work in [[photovoltaics]], [[sustainable engineering]] and other technologies designed to innovate PARC products to be "environmentally friendly".  PARC currently conducts research into "clean technology", user interface design, sensemaking, ubiquitous computing and context-aware systems, large-area electronics, and model-based control and optimization in embedded, intelligent systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[PARC (company)#PARC today]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Garner is currently managing the Energy Systems group in the Hardware Systems Laboratory, and has a focus on CleanTech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleantechopen.com/app.cgi/content/home/index |title=Home The Cleantech Open}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of which PARC is a major sponsor.

'''Shih Ming-teh''' ({{zh|c=施明德}}; born 15 January 1941) commonly known as '''Chairman Shih''', is a political activist in [[Taiwan]] and was once a [[political prisoner]] for 25-and-a-half years.

He was arrested at the age of 21 in 1962 and charged with creating the "Taiwan Independence League" (a study group) with the intention of overthrowing the [[Kuomintang]] government, Shih was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].  The sentence was commuted to 15 years in 1975, and Shih was released on 16 June 1977.

He promptly joined the [[Tangwai]] (literally meaning "outside the party", because the Kuomintang was the only legally existing political party in Taiwan at that time), became a reporter for the ''[[Liberty Times]]'' and married the American researcher [[Linda Arrigo|Linda Gail Arrigo]]. After playing a part in organizing the 10 December 1979 pro-democracy rally subsequently known as the [[Kaohsiung Incident]], (also known as the Formosa Incident or Meilitao Incident), an arrest warrant was issued charging Shih with treason, and following 26 days on the run he was again arrested and sentenced to life in prison. In 1984, while he was incarcerated, Polish politician and Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Lech Wałęsa]] nominated him for Peace Prize.

In July 1987, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] lifted [[martial law]] and offered an amnesty to Shih, but he refused to accept. On 20 May 1990 he was finally released. In total, he spent 25 years in prison, 13 years in [[solitary confinement]] and over 4 years on hunger strike.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In 1994, he was elected leader of the legalized opposition Democratic Progressive Party. He was also elected legislator in three occasions. Shih's proposal of a political "[[Grand Reconciliation]]" in Taiwan earned him strong rejection from within the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], to which he resigned on 14 November 2000.

In 2006, Shih carried out a massive protest, known as [[Million Voices Against Corruption, President Chen Must Go]], in an effort to force the embattled president [[Chen Shui-bian]] to resign. He led an around the clock sit-in in front of the Presidential Building and [[Taipei Railway Station]] in Taipei City, pledging to remain there until such time as President Chen resigned, or the reached the end of his term in March 2008. On 5 December 2006, he left Taipei Railway Station pledging to continue the protest alone in "self-reclusion" at an apartment nearby. As of April 2007, this protest has ended.

Shih was one of the most prominent personalities of the Tangwai movement and greatly contributed to Taiwan's democratization{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. He had been referred to by some as "Taiwan's [[Nelson Mandela|Mandela]]"{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
Shih Ming-te's father Shih Kuo-tsui was a well-known practitioner of [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medicine]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

In February 1947, Shih Ming-te witnessed at [[Kaohsiung Station]] that would later be known as the [[February 28 Incident]]. The student leaders of schools were charged as instigators and some were executed as riots broke out. Students seized weapons from Harbor Garrison and exchanged fires with the guards.

He entered Kaohsiung's Chung-Cheng Senior High in 1957. In 1959, after failing to pass his college entrance exam, he signed up with the ROC Army, passing the admission exams for the artillery school. On occasion he vowed in public to overthrow the ROC government by force, through an armed coup d'état as an army officer. {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. That same year, his girlfriend gave birth to a daughter when he was 19.&lt;ref name="〈從軍造反記〉"&gt;[http://www.nori.org.tw/read/youth.html 〈從軍造反記〉] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724124423/http://www.nori.org.tw/read/youth.html |date=July 24, 2011 }}，奉獻者•施明德 傳記 新台灣研究文教基金會&lt;/ref&gt;

He briefly served as an artillery officer in [[Kinmen]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

=== First imprisonment: 1962–1977 ===
In 1962 Shih was arrested for alleged involvement in the "[[Formosa Independence Movement]]"; over 30 more accomplices, mostly army school and university students, were also arrested. Shih's two brothers, poet and painter [[Shih Ming-cheng]] and medical school student [[Shih Ming-hsiung]] were among them.

In 1964 Shih was sentenced to life imprisonment for orchestrating the independence movement. He was also stripped of his civil rights for life. Shih was roughened up and suffered the loss of his teeth and spinal damage at the age of 22{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

The [[Kuomintang]] regime considered outspoken Shih as a highly dangerous political criminal and therefore prevented him from doing any forced labor that would put him in contact with the world outside prison{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. This gave him time to do research and study{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Shih focused on philosophy, history, international law, linguistics and Japanese{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. He also developed a strong and resolute personality in prison{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

In the 1970s, Taiwan's government suffered several blows to its international status. First, its seat at the United Nations was taken over by the People's Republic of China, then the United States established official ties with Beijing, severing those with Taipei. A rebellion in the Taiyuan prison, where many of the inmates were political prisoners, was planned{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Access to the Taitung radio station and a publicly broadcast declaration of Taiwan's independence from China was one of their goals{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Many pro-independence prisoners took part in the plot{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. On 8 February 1970 five prisoners murdered a guard and tried to take his gun. Ultimately the five inmates broke from prison, only to be caught soon after. The breakout plot was foiled. The Kuomintang believed Shih was one of the masterminds of the uprising and therefore kept him in isolation during his time in Taiyuan{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. To this date, the investigation documents are still kept confidential and the implication of Shih is disputed by Shih himself, who sued Lin Shu-chi for defamation{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

In 1974, after 12 years of imprisonment, Shih's first wife Chen Li-chu asked for divorce. She had had an affair with one of Shih's friends, who was released before Shih. In 1975, when president [[Chiang Kai-shek]] died, his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] succeeded as KMT Chairman. Under his rule, a leniency policy was implemented. On 16 June 1977, Shih was released after serving only 15 years of a life sentence.

=== Leader of the [[Kaohsiung Incident]] ===
During [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]'s presidency, political opposition to the [[Kuomintang]] was suppressed. After [[Peter Huang]]'s attempt to assassinate Chiang proved unsuccessful, the KMT became more aware of opposition. Shih Ming-teh created a "party without a name" amidst the absence of freedom of association in Taiwan at that time. In September 1978 Shih became active in the [[tangwai movement]]. In May 1979 this group of non-Kuomintang activists established the ''[[Formosa Magazine|Meilitao Magazine]]''; Shih was named general manager. During this time, he adopted the English nickname "Nori", after the [[Kun'yomi|Japanese pronunciation]] of the second [[Chinese character]] in his given name, "Teh". For historical reasons, this nickname served as a [[shibboleth]] to enrage ''[[Waishengren]]'' people in Taiwan (mainlanders whose ancestors fought the Japanese), and endear him to the ''benshengren'' (less-recent Hokkien migrants disenfranchised by the Waishengren, and who have a more positive view of Japanese colonization).&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, Richard C. (2000) ''Chen Shui-Bian: Building A Community And A Nation''. Asia-Pacific Academic Exchange Foundation. p.68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chee, Soon Juan (1998). ''To Be Free: To be Free: Stories from Asia's Struggle Against Oppression''. Monash Asia Institute. p.9&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December 1979, the Tangwai group commemorated the [[Human Rights Day]] in Kaohsiung. The rally operated without prior approval, with specific stipulations that no torches and weapons were allowed. Police intervened and clashed with the protestors resulting in various damages. The event would be known as the [[Kaohsiung Incident|Meilitao Incident]], a milestone in Taiwan's democratization process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwandc.org/hst-1979.htm 〈The "Kaohsiung Incident" of 1979〉]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days later, Shih dramatically escaped: [[Chang Wen-ing]], then a dentist and later Mayor of [[Taichung City]], performed plastic surgery on Shih to change his looks so he could escape overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huang|first1=Joyce|title=Newsmakers: Taichung Major Chang goes it alone|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/2001/10/15/0000107194/1|accessdate=23 April 2017|date=15 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shih was later caught along with the dentist, and sentenced to life in prison for the second time.

During the 1980 Meilitao Incident trials Shih was defiant and proud facing a potentially fatal court-martial decision{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. He declared during his defense: "Taiwan should be independent, in fact, it already is, it has been for 30 years and currently it is known as the Republic of China"{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Shih also demanded an end to the political monopoly of the Kuomintang, the control of the Taiwanese press, and martial law, so that the 30-plus-year rubber-stamping legislative session could be dissolved{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

=== Second imprisonment and hunger strike: 1980–1990 ===
In 1983, one of {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} Shih's allies, Professor [[Chen Wen-chen]] ,was murdered;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twhistory.org.tw/20010702.htm 〈Truth, finding the perpetrator, and recollection: The 20th anniversary of the Chen Wen-chen incident&gt; ] 台灣歷史學會&lt;/ref&gt; Shih Ming-te began a 1-month hunger strike to protest what he believed to be an assassination ordered by the secret police{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

[[Communist Poland|Polish]] union leader [[Lech Wałęsa]] (Nobel Peace 1983) nominated Shih Ming-teh for the 1984 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

In 1985, Shih commenced an indefinite [[hunger strike]]. He demanded an end to [[martial law]] and state-sponsored political murders{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}, implementation of a democratic system and release of all Meilitao Incident political prisoners. Shih was sent to the Tri-Service General Hospital and underwent [[force-feeding]] through a [[nasogastric tube]] during his four and half years of protest.

On 15 July 1987, the 38-year-long order of martial law was declared over by the KMT government, when President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] announced nationwide sentence reductions and conditional releases. Shih declined the offer{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. In 1988, Shih went on another hunger strike protest with his brother Shih Ming-cheng. His brother died on 23 August 1988;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prison report Editorial: Let Shih Ming-teh go!|journal=Taiwan Communiqué|date=September 1988|issue=36|page=19|url=http://www.taiwandc.org/twcom/tc36-int.pdf|issn=1027-3999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shih survived.

=== Release ===
On 20 May 1990, the new president [[Lee Teng-hui]] officially assumed the presidency and ordered a special amnesty for all Meilitao Incident prisoners. Shih ripped up his amnesty document and demanded an unconditional release{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. When President Lee announced the invalidation of the Meilitao Trials, Shih Ming-te finally accepted his release as an innocent person{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Upon recovering his freedom, he joined the now legal [[Democratic Progressive Party]], which originated in the Tangwai movement.

=== Political career ===
In 1992, Shih was elected [[legislator]] for the Tainan County constituency in the [[Legislative Yuan]]. [[Republic of China legislative election, 1992|This election]] was the first free direct legislative elections in Taiwan history.

Between 1994 and 1996 Shih was elected Chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party.&lt;ref name="dpp_president"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpp.org.tw/history/pub/LIT_4.asp?ctyp=LITERATURE&amp;catid=1816 |title=民主進步黨歷任黨主席 |accessdate=December 25, 2006 |author=民主進步黨 |date=2002 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061015003717/http://www.dpp.org.tw/history/pub/LIT_4.asp?ctyp=LITERATURE&amp;catid=1816 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, he claimed that "Taiwan is already an independent and sovereign nation, when the Democratic Progressive Party is in power, there is no need and it will not announce Taiwan's independence". At the same time Shih proposed a political and social Grand Reconciliation. Elected legislator for a new term in 1996, he ran for the presidency of the Legislative Yuan, gaining a vote from former archrival [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]] but losing one from Democratic Progressive Party legislator Chang Chin-cheng. [[Liu Sung-pan]] was elected the [[President of the Legislative Yuan]].

On 23 March 1996, [[Republic of China presidential election, 1996|Taiwan's first direct presidential election]] was held. The Democratic Progressive Party's candidate was defeated by incumbent president [[Lee Teng-hui]], with only 21.1% of the vote(The DPP got around 30% in before regional elections). Shih Ming-te resigned to his position as party chief, and Chang Chun-hsiung assumeed as acting leader of the opposition party. Shih shifted his attention to the completion of the "Meilitao [[Oral History]] Records".

[[File:President Direct Election Movement Ming-te Shih Yi-hsiung Lin and Hsin-liang Hsu.jpg|left|400px|thumb|Shih (left front) in 1992]]

On 1 April 1997, Shih was indicted for a violation to the Mass Gathering and Demonstration Act. He had organized in 1992 a protest demanding direct presidential elections. [[Huang Hsin-chieh]], [[Hsu Hsin-liang]] and [[Lin Yi-hsiung]] went to prison with Shih for 50 days. This was the third time Shih was imprisoned, but now as a legislator. He was released after 41 days.

In 1998, Shih was re-elected legislator but this time representing a [[Taipei City]] constituency. He would continue his efforts for the completion of the "Meilitao Oral History Records". In three years, 200 individuals of the political spectrum. The oral testimonies amounted to over 6 million words, and were edited to a 600,000 word four volume version. To date, this is the most comprehensive historical research of the 1970–1990 era in Taiwan's development, earning it a publishing prize. This was the result of Shih's individual efforts, using his own financial and personal resources. Neither the Democratic Progressive Party nor the government of Taiwan have helped complete this overwhelming historic research project.

In 2000, [[Chen Shui-bian]], the former [[Mayor of Taipei City]], was elected president. Shih congratulated the leader of the Democratic Progressive Party [[Lin Yi-hsiung]] for the triumph. He said in an interview that since his childhood dream of ousting the Chiang's KMT regime had been accomplished, he would leave the political party. In May, Chen before he assumed the presidency, visited Shih's office to personally ask him if he was willing to be appointed senior political advisor. Shih rejected Chen's offer once more, but instead proposed Hsu Hsin-liang for the position.

Shih condemned President Chen for leading the country with a minority government, ignoring the KMT majority in the Legislative Yuan and risking political stability. After Chen rejected his suggestion for an alliance with the opposition majority in the Legislative Yuan, Shih further walked away from the party. Believing that Taiwan's greatest challenge in the 21st century was globalization, together with former colleagues Hsu Hsin-liang and [[Sisy Chen]], famous Wen Shih-ren and a dozen others intellectuals and entrepreneurs, founded the "''Shan'' (Mountain) Alliance". Their goal: to draw a road map for Taiwan in the 21st century.

Shih ran as an independent twice, in December 2001 and December 2004. On the first occasion he lost with 24,925 votes, on the second he narrowly lost the race by receiving 26,974 votes in the highly contested Taipei North Constituency. He had proposed a parliamentary political system to overcome the aggravation of political differences in Taiwan's society.

In December 2002, Shih ran as Mayor candidate for Kaohsiung City. His platform: turn the port-city into a [[free port]], much like Hong Kong or [[Amsterdam]], to cope with the challenge of [[globalization]]. Direct maritime links with Chinese ports was also part of the proposal. Shih perceived that the political division was so severe that he decided to announce his withdrawal three days before the election.

In September 2003, Shih Ming-te was a visiting scholar at [[George Mason University]] for a one-year period. During his tenure, Shih researched what he called the "One China: European Union Model" as a means of ending the impasse between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and reiterated his proposal for a constitutional amendment in favor of a parliamentary system, in an attempt to put an end to the political polarization into the two camps (blue or Kuomintang-based and green or Democratic Progressive Party-centered) which was deteriorating into ethnic rivalry between Chinese refugees coming to rule Taiwan in 1949, and those who were there before that time.

On 6 October 2005, the Department of Political Science at the [[National Taiwan University]] opens the "Shih Ming-te Lecture" series; ethnic harmony, political reconciliation and cross-Strait peace are its core values.

In May, 2006, "Shih Ming-te Lecture" invited Mr. [[Frederik Willem de Klerk]], Former [[State President of South Africa]], to a dialog with Shih Ming-te: "Maintaining Peace: South Africa's Experience, a Perspective for Taiwan?" is the topic.

In May 2015, Shih announced his intention to run for president as an independent candidate in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loa|first1=Lok-sin|title=Shih Ming-te launches campaign for presidency|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/05/22/2003618886|accessdate=22 May 2015|work=Taipei Times|date=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again reiterated the Broad One China Framework first proposed in 2014, in which China and Taiwan govern one legal entity separately. Both governments would be allowed to join international organizations and not use military force against the other, instead "resolving issues through consensus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=I-chia|title=‘Broad one-China framework’ set|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/05/28/2003591400|accessdate=22 May 2015|work=Taipei Times|date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chen|first1=Wei-ting|last2=Kuo|first2=Chung-han|title=Presidential hopeful Shih Ming-teh vows to form coalition Cabinet|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201505210025.aspx|accessdate=22 May 2015|agency=Central News Agency|date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shih ended his campaign in September, as he had not been able to fulfill the [[Central Election Commission (Taiwan)|Central Election Commission]] requirements needed to stand in the 2016 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kao|first1=Evelyn|title=Independent pulls out of presidential race|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201509150026.aspx|accessdate=16 September 2015|agency=Central News Agency|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerber|first1=Abraham|title=Shih Ming-te fails to meet threshold, ends candidacy|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/09/16/2003627834|accessdate=16 September 2015|work=Taipei Times|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Million Voices Against Corruption, Chen Must Go Campaign ==

===Chronology===
On 9 August 2006, Shih wrote an open letter to President [[Chen Shui-bian]], whose aides, wife and son-in-law were implicated in several corruption cases. Shih urged Chen to resign as a display of strength in times of crisis, respect for public opinion and acknowledgement of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nori.org.tw/english/main3.asp?idno=30 〈Shih Ming-teh's Letter To Chen Shui-bian〉] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205010250/http://www.nori.org.tw/english/main3.asp?idno=30 |date=December 5, 2008 }}, Million Voices Against Corruption-Chen Must Go Headquarters&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Chen Shui-bian had been Shih's defense attorney in the aftermath of the [[Kaohsiung Incident]] and had been imprisoned for 18 months himself.

On 12 August 2006, Shih gave a keynote speech to kick-start the "Million Voices Against Corruption-Chen Must Go" campaign in the February 28 Incident Memorial Park. He argued that the people could not bear with so much corruption anymore. Shih asks all those who support the movement a NT$100 (US$3, €2.3) donation as a symbol of commitment and consent, as well as a display of determination to ask Chen Shui-bian to leave the Presidential Office. Shih vowed to lead the people in a protest until Chen Shui-bian stepped down if the donations came in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2006/08/12/87690/NT$100-donation.htm 〈NT$100 donation fund legal, account numbers available: Ho〉], August 12, 2006, the china news&lt;/ref&gt; By 22 August 2006, a sum equivalent of that from over 1 million people had been received (the actual number of donators cannot be computed because there was no restriction on the maximum amount of money one could transfer to the designated account) in only seven days. The designated account was quickly closed and the preparations for the marathon protest started.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5323466.stm 〈Protests against Chen gain ground 〉], September 7, 2006, BBC NEWS&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2006, the anti-corruption campaign organizers started training for the sit-ins (emergency procedures in case of police intervention).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2006/08/25/88743/Deposing-Chen.htm 〈Deposing Chen up to people's will, Shih says〉], August 25, 2006, the china post&lt;/ref&gt; The sit-in began on a rainy day on 9 September 2006. According to the Chinapost, over 300,000 people gathered that day on Ketagalan Avenue, in front of the Presidential Building in Taipei under the pouring rain. The Taipei Police Department claimed there were only 100,00 protestors. According to the organizers' request, most of them were wearing red shirts; no controversial flags or political icons should be displayed, not even the Republic of China flag, perceived as a pro-Kuomintang device. Some protestors still brought along a small Republic of China flag or other campaign items with them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5329816.stm 〈Taiwan leader faces mass protest 〉], September 9, 2006, BBC NEWS&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2006, a Democratic Progressive Party Taipei city counselor booked the [[Ketagalan Boulevard]] site where the red-clad protestors were still gathered. Shih Ming-teh decided to move the protest to Taipei Railway Station. A climax was reached the night of the procession: a large perimeter of over 5.5 kilometers around the heavily guarded Presidential Building and Residence at the heart of Taipei was quickly flooded by peaceful red-clad protestors: the ''China Post'' reported that over 8 hundred thousand people had joined the candlelight encirclement; the Taipei Police again contradicted this with an estimate of 3 hundred thousand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5348830.stm 〈TMass march against Taiwan leader 〉], September 15, 2006, BBC NEWS&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 2006, Shih declared that he would not form his own political party nor participate in any political negotiations, he also made it clear that he was not willing to engage in negotiations with former president Lee Teng-hui; instead he would stay with the red-clad anti-Chen protestors. On 20 November 2006, Shih Ming-te urged Taipei City Mayor [[Ma Ying-jeou]] (the Kuomintang's 2008 presidential hopeful) to resign amidst accusations of corruption. Shih said he was not contemplating anti-corruption protests against Ma, but insisted there should not be double standards regarding corruption allegations. Ma was acquitted.

On 30 November 2006, the last night of protest by the Million Voices Against Corruption, Chen Must Go Campaign. Shih Ming-te later travelled to Thailand for a TV interview and panel discussion.

On 7 December 2006, the Special State Funds case of President Chen and his wife was underway, campaign organizers claimed that Taiwan needed to go back to normal, but Shih would protest until Chen steps down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uncleyap-news.blogspot.com/2006/12/rocs-mr-shih-ming-teh-will-begin-self.html 〈ROC's Mr. Shih Ming Teh will begin SELF-IMPRISONMENT 〉], December 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2007, Shih announced the end to his self-imprisonment and started preparations for the second stage of the anti-Chen campaign. Plans involved presenting candidates for the next legislative elections. Originally schedduled for late 2007, the elections would instead be carried out in early 2008.

== Controversy ==
Shih is often considered a "romantic revolutionary" in Taiwan media. He believes that he is rooted in his ability "to pursue unlimited aspirations and ideals under restrictive conditions".&lt;ref name="〈從軍造反記〉"/&gt; The latest editions of Taiwan's High-School textbooks list Shih Ming-teh as a political activist. Shih's former Legislative Yuan secretary, cartoonist and writer Yu-fu, thinks Shih "is never quite sure of his own place in history".

Shih is accused by his ex-wife Chen, Li Zhu, in her book, "The Innocent Song of a Taiwanese Woman," of using her as a sex toy, and failing his responsibility as a husband.  Chen also claimed Shih been indifferent to his responsibility toward their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taiwan.huanqiu.com/gossip/2008-09/236314.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927064938/http://taiwan.huanqiu.com/gossip/2008-09/236314.html |archivedate=September 27, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shih Ming-te often says: "I have been locked up for 25 years, where were you then?"{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}.

Another former secretary of Shih, Kuo Wen-pin, wrote about his opinion of Shih on Taiwan Daily (15 October 2000): Taking a look at 40 years of his struggle for Taiwan's democracy, he revealed himself as a visionary, making several pioneering proposals ahead of his time.

Over 20 years ago, Shih already said the four evils of Taiwan's path towards democracy were the political monopoly by the Kuomintang, the press control in Taiwan, the martial law and the "ten thousand year" legislative session (萬年國會). Risking death penalty, Shih advocated for a "Republic of China, Taiwanese Independence Model", and added that "Taiwan is already an independent country, it has been so for over 30 years". For his opinions, Shih was considered seditious and the media, organizations, academia, everyone attacked him and humiliated him, only for the Democratic Progressive Party to adopt and implement his ideas; they even led the way to Lee Teng-hui's "Silent Revolution" political compromises. When the Kuomintang's 50 years in power ended, the Chen Shui-bian administration accepted some of his teachings. Arrests and repression are no longer the defensive measures of the regime when facing harsh criticism, but the abuse of public power and the media by individuals to insult, humiliate, and defame others is still common practice. The DPP party has vowed to improve its image with more diplomatic means, but this has yet to be seen.

In the aftermath of Shih's "red-shirt" movement, he became a darling of PRC-controlled media, including CCTVPhoenix TV, and the People's Daily.&lt;ref&gt;http://history.huanqiu.com/people/2010-05/806828_7.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Shih's efforts in discrediting the DPP have been widely praised and reported by various media outlets controlled or owned by the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.china.com.cn/chinese/zhuanti/238778.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November 2006, ifeng.com, web portal of pro-CCP television channel Phoenix TV, reported Shih planned a trip to Thailand to discuss his "red shirt" philosophy.  In the same article, Shih also rebutted claims by representative of the American Institute in Taiwan that the red shirts instigated violence and caused social upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.ifeng.com/taiwan/detail_2006_11/20/967875_0.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January 2010, [http://www.chinanews.com.cn/tw/tw-twyw/news/2010/01-16/2075541.shtml chinanews.com.cn, a PRC media outlet, reported the possibility of Shih running for presidency in 2012.] On 19 April 2010, www.chinataiwan.org, a Chinese government sponsored site, reported Shih claimed numerous prominent DPP leaders, including Chen Shui-bian and Hsieh Chang-ting, were undercover agents for the Kuomintang against political dissidents during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinataiwan.org/plzhx/hxshp/zhzh/201004/t20100419_1326363.htm&lt;/ref&gt; According to Huaxia.com, yet another pro-CCP website, Shih's accusations have caused a general panic in the DPP.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huaxia.com/thpl/tdyh/wzf/2010/04/1849396.html&lt;/ref&gt; A former supporter and pastor of the Presbyterian Church, Wang, Jie Nan, wrote an opinion piece highlighting his disappointment with Shih, starting from Shih's "red shirt" movement and his subsequent efforts to undermine the DPP with outlandish accusations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2010/new/apr/24/today-o3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2011, Shih courted controversy when he asked [[Tsai Ing-Wen]] to publicly disclose her sexual orientation before she participated in her presidential bid. Despite his own support for [[LGBT rights in Taiwan]], Shih was roundly criticized by major women's groups including the Awakening Foundation, the Taiwan Women's Link and the Taiwan Gender Equity Education Association. Tsai herself characterized the request as "surprising" and refused to reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/04/17/2003500949|title = Tsai takes stand on right to privacy|work=The Taipei Times |date = Apr 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Small Luk''', formerly named Luk yiu-hung, is the first [[intersex]] person to openly acknowledge her biological sex characteristics in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name = "day" /&gt; She was born with [[partial androgen insensitivity syndrome]].&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; Luk lived as a male for 36 years, and now lives as a woman.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.timeout.com.hk/gay-lesbian/features/72091/interview-we-talk-to-intersex-individual-dr-small-luk-about-her-gender-struggles.html | title = We talk to intersex individual Dr Small Luk about her gender struggles | publisher = Time Out Hong Kong }}&lt;/ref&gt; She founded the organization “Beyond Boundaries – Knowing and Concerns Intersex”&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.facebook.com/concerns.IS | title = Beyond Boundaries – Knowing and Concerns Intersex}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011, which is concerned with, and strives for, the rights of [[intersex]] people.

== Background ==

Small Luk was the first child of her family. When Luk was born, the doctor found that she was intersex, with organs resembling testicles and a penis. Luk was deemed male and underwent more than 20 operations between the ages of 8 and 13 to construct a [[urethra]] – the duct that conducts urine from the bladder. When she was 12, the surgery failed. Luk found the surgery too unbearable and attempted suicide several times. News records state that Luk&lt;ref name="scmp" /&gt; was the only surviving person among the seven people who were operated on as children at Hong Kong’s [[Kwong Wah Hospital]] in the 1970s to "fix" their anatomies. After surgery at the age of 13, Luk refused further genital reconstruction.

During adolescence, Luk developed breasts, suffered stomach cramps and saw blood in her urine. Doctors explained that her body did not respond to [[androgen]]. Luk eventually underwent surgery to remove her male [[genitalia]], and now lives as a woman.&lt;ref name = "scmp"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/1905393/no-child-should-endure-my-ordeal-says-sex-disorder-hongkonger-forced-be | title = No child should endure my ordeal | publisher = [[South China Morning Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://thestandnews.com/lgbtq/%E9%86%AB%E7%94%9F%E8%AA%AA%E6%98%AF%E9%99%B0%E8%8E%96-%E5%85%B6%E5%AF%A6%E6%98%AF%E4%B8%80%E6%A2%9D%E8%82%89-%E5%B0%88%E8%A8%AA%E9%9B%99%E6%80%A7%E4%BA%BA-%E7%B4%B0%E7%B4%B0%E8%80%81%E5%B8%AB/ | title = 醫生說是陰莖 其實是一條肉 — 專訪雙性人 細細老師 | publisher = Stand News | date = 24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the surgical pain, Luk also suffered from bullying. Luk was at the receiving end of discrimination from classmates and teachers.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

== Education ==
Despite the past, Luk has completed her education, earning degrees in [[social work]] and [[traditional Chinese medicine]], as well as a master’s in gender studies at [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]]. She now runs a holistic treatment clinic in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gdottv.com/main/archives/1964 | title = 紀錄片《 Intersex 雙性迷思》 — 首位出櫃香港雙性人細細老師的故事｜轉載影片 | publisher = GTV | date = 26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
Small Luk founded the organization “Beyond Borders-- knowing and concerns intersex” &lt;ref name="day"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://intersexday.org/en/beyond-boundaries-intersex-hk-china/ | title = Beyond boundaries: intersex in Hong Kong and China | publisher = [[Intersex Awareness Day|Intersex Day]] | date = 20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt; in 2011, and it has been working to spread awareness about intersex people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8053">'''Space in landscape design''' refers to theories about the meaning and [[nature]] of [[space]] as a [[volume]] and as an element of [[design]]. The concept of space as the fundamental medium of [[landscape design]] grew from debates tied to [[modernism]], [[contemporary art]], Asian art and design as seen in the [[Japanese garden]], and [[architecture]].

==Europe==
[[Elizabeth K. Meyer]] cites [[Claude-Henri Watelet|Claude-Henri Watelet's]] ''Essay on Gardens'' (1774) as perhaps the first reference to space in garden/architectural theory.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, lecture notes: "The Spatial medium of modernism between open space and figural space/Kiley's articulated spaces and multivalent landscapes: abstract modern grid and contextual response/The grid, the bosque, the allée. Planted form as spatial device".&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] in 1918 wrote "Space Composition in Architecture", which directly linked [[painting]] and [[gardens]] as arts involved in the creation of space.

The origins of modern northern European thought is a German [[aesthetic philosophy]] of the 1890s. By the 1920s,  [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theories of relativity were replacing [[Sir Isaac Newton|Newton's]] conception of universal space. Practitioners such as [[Fletcher Steele]], [[James C. Rose|James Rose]], [[Garrett Eckbo]], and [[Dan Kiley]] began to write and design through a vocabulary of lines, volumes, masses and planes in an attempt to replace the prevalent debate, centered around ideas of the formal and informal, with one that would more closely align their field with the [[fine art]]s.

According to [[Adrian Forty]],&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Forty, ''Words and Building: A Vocabulary of Modern Architecture'' (New York: Thames and Hudson, 2000), 256-275.&lt;/ref&gt; the term "[[space]]" in relation to design was all but meaningless until the 1890s. At that time two schools began to develop. Viennese [[Gottfried Semper]] in 1880 developed an [[architectural theory]] based the idea that the first impulse of [[architecture]] was the enclosure of space. [[Camillo Sitte]] extended Semper's ideas to exterior spaces in his ''City Planning According to Artistic Principles'' (1889). Concurrently, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] built on ideas from [[Emmanuel Kant|Kant]] which emphasized the experience of space as a force field generated by human movement and perception. [[Martin Heidegger]] would later contradict both of these schools. In his 1927 ''Being and Time'' and 1951 "Building, Dwelling, Thinking" he claimed that space was neither a construct of the mind nor a given, but was "that for which a room has been made" and was created by the object within a room rather than the room itself. [[Henri Lefebvre]] would call all of this into question, linking designers' notions of themselves as space-makers to a subservience to a dominant [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. He felt that the [[abstract space]] they had created had destroyed [[social space]] through alienation, separation, and a privileging of the eye.

[[James C. Rose|James Rose]] and [[Garrett Eckbo]], colleagues at [[Harvard]] in the 1930s, were the pioneers of a movement which adopted ideas about space from artists such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Naum Gabo]] and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]], and from architectural ideas based om [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe's]] [[free plan]]. Seeing gardens as outdoor rooms or [[sculptures]] to be walked through, they prioritized movement. In analogy to [[painting]] and [[sculpture]], Rose in particular saw elements of [[landscape]] as having architectural volume, not just mass: "In pure landscape, we drop the structural shell and the volume is defined by earth, paving, water and ground cover; foliage, walls, structures and other vertical elements on the sides, and sky, branching and roofing above."&lt;ref&gt;James Rose, "Plant Forms and Space" Pencil Points 10(1938), 227.&lt;/ref&gt;   Eckbo adopted the grid of [[columns]] and thin [[wall]]s of the free plan to make a statement about the social function of the [[garden]] as a place where the [[individual]] and the [[collective]] coincide.

By the 1940s, writings about space in landscape design had proliferated. [[Siegfried Giedion]], in his ''Space, Time and Architecture'', reframed the history of architecture as that of the history of space. [[Ernő Goldfinger]] wrote several influential articles in ''Architectural Review''&lt;ref&gt;"The Sensation of Space", "The Elements of Enclosed Space", and "Urbanism and Spatial Order", 1941-1942.&lt;/ref&gt;  addressing the subconscious effect of the sizes and shapes of spaces. He notes that [[perception]] of space happens in a state of distraction: we are required to move through a landscape in order to fully experience it. [[Dan Kiley]] absorbed these writings and built upon the work of Rose and Eckbo, promoting asymmetry over [[symmetry]], [[balance in art|balance]] over [[hierarchy]], multiple centers, and figure-ground ambiguity.

==Minimalism==
[[Minimalism|Minimalist art]] would have a profound influence on designers of the 1960s such as [[Peter Walker (architect)|Peter Walker]], [[Martha Schwartz]], and [[Hideo Sasaki]]. On the one hand, [[Sol LeWitt|Sol LeWitt's]] space-frame sculptures and [[Carl Andre|Carl Andre's]] floor sculptures of [[mass production|mass-produced objects]] allowed a re-thinking of the necessity for [[wall]]s in the formation of [[space]]. [[Geometry]], repetition, and changes in ground plane created a "field of making" in which walls and even plantings were questioned as essential elements of landscape. Equally at issue in applied practice was the [[perception]] on the part of Sasaki that landscape had come to be seen as "open space", a white sheet of paper on which to display [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] buildings. This disconnection with the [[landscape]] was especially notable in corporate office parks, and Sasaki and Walker addressed this through an attempt to connect interior and exterior spaces.

[[James Corner]] considers landscape spatiality to be one of the three things that distinguish the medium of landscape (the others are landscape temporality and landscape materiality). He refers to [[Gaston Bachelard]]&lt;ref&gt;Bachelard's ''The Poetics of Space'' was published in 1951 and had immense influence on designers and artists.&lt;/ref&gt;  in emphasizing the role of scale and psychic location, which distinguish the space of landscape from that of [[architecture]] and [[painting]]: "the immediate immensity of the world from the inner immensity of the imagination, the inner space of the self&lt;ref&gt;James Corner, "Representation and landscape: drawing and making in the landscape medium" Word &amp; Image 8(July-Sept. 1992) 246.&lt;/ref&gt;".

[[Augustin Berque]] analyses landscape space by comparing Newtonian [[universal space]] and [[René Descartes|Cartesian dualistic space]], in which there is a distinct separation between subject and object, and Chinese mediumistic space, in which a unity of landscape and environment corresponds to a unity of mind and body. Thus [[postmodernism|postmodern thought]] brings together the concepts of space as product of [[mind]], [[Human body|body]] and [[culture]]. Rather than being the negative of the objects that occupy it, space can be seen as its own volume with undeniable importance as a design tool. In contemporary design, it is considered a palpable, lived [[phenomenon]] that contributes to our [[perception]] and [[experience]] of the world in subtle but often intentional ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7163">The '''Spanish blanks plot''' was an alleged pro-Spanish Catholic conspiracy in Scotland, discovered in late 1592. A number of letters to Spain were discovered, which included blank sheets signed by prominent nobles.

==Background==
The [[Spanish Armada]] had failed in its attempt to conquer England in 1588. The undeclared [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War]] continued, however. The [[Kingdom of Scotland]] under [[James VI]] was divided over religion, despite the formal ascendancy of the [[Church of Scotland]] at this time in a [[presbyterian]] form. The Scottish nobility were turbulent, while the king was working to assert administrative and political control of the country against factional and religious strife. A [[Jesuit]] mission concerned with Scotland included [[William Crichton (Jesuit)|William Crichton]] and [[Robert Abercromby (missionary)|Robert Abercromby]]; it looked to help from Spain to further the aims of the [[Counter-reformation]] in the British Isles.

==Discovery==
[[Andrew Knox (bishop)|Andrew Knox]], Minister of Paisley was sent to arrest George Kerr,&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=15780|title=Knox, Andrew|first=James|last=Kirk}}&lt;/ref&gt; son of [[Mark Kerr (abbot)|Mark Kerr of Newbattle]]. George Kerr was about to sail to Spain from the west coast of Scotland, and carried incriminating correspondence. He was arrested at night on the [[Isle of Cumbrae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas M. McCoog|author2=Campion Hall (University of Oxford)|title=The Reckoned Expense: Edmund Campion and the Early English Jesuits : Essays in Celebration of the First Centenary of Campion Hall, Oxford (1896-1996)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f01RY4H7MfoC&amp;pg=PA216|accessdate=24 May 2012|year=1996|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-0-85115-590-6|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Spanish blanks" which were found with other letters in a chest on Kerr's boat, were documents signed by four members of the Catholic nobility of Scotland, and otherwise left to be filled in. At first, the English diplomat [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] supposed the blanks had writing in [[invisible ink]] written with "white [[vitriol]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (1936), pp. 823, 828–9, describes the blanks.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Kerr, his servant, and the letters were taken to Edinburgh and examined by the Privy Council on 2 January 1593.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol.10 (1936), pp. 829–833, with a list of the letters, not including the royal "position paper."&lt;/ref&gt; Under torture, Kerr said that the blanks were to be filled in by Crichton, to forward a Spanish invasion.&lt;ref name="McCoog2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas M.

==Investigation==
Three prominent Earls were directly implicated:
*[[William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=7931|title=|first=Allan|last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=12715|title=Hay, Francis|first=Concepcion|last=Saenz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=11036|title=Gordon, George|first=J. R. M.|last= Sizer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The fourth signature on the papers discovered was that of Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchindoun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. B. Patterson|title=King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYK_Czpa1WwC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=24 May 2012|date=14 September 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79385-8|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erroll and Huntly were given a date of 5 February to appear and explain themselves: they did not do so, and went to ground in the north. The king was confronted by them on 24 October, on the road from [[Soutra]] to [[Fala, Midlothian|Fala]], south-east of Edinburgh; they explained that the blanks related to their support for the Jesuits in Scotland.&lt;ref name="McCoog2012"/&gt;

Others involved were:

==Aftermath==
An official account of the plot appeared in February 1593; it is assumed it was edited by [[John Davidson (minister)|John Davidson]]. It by no means included all the intercepted letters; but it printed a number concerned with [[William Sempill]] in 1589; the connection was that when Sempill's servant Pringle was found in England carrying letters to the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]], they had included some from Huntly and Erroll.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Rawson Elder]], ''Spanish Influences in Scottish History'' (1920), p. 188; [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028145526#page/n203/mode/2up archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Sempill, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perceptions of James VI shifted after the discoveries: some assumed the affair showed the king had at least tacitly approved dealings with Spain, and many more put it down to slackness in anti-Catholic measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Crawford Gribben|author2=David George Mullan|title=Literature and the Scottish Reformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMZD6zBkzbcC&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=24 May 2012|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6715-5|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lucky Country''''' is a 1964 book by [[Donald Horne]]. The title has become a nickname for [[Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-03/australia-is-second-best-place3a-un/3620398/?site=melbourne "Australia second best place to live: UN"], [[774 ABC Melbourne]], 3 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and is generally used favourably, although the origin of the phrase was negative in the context of the book. Among other things, it has been used in reference to Australia's natural resources, weather, history, its early dependency of the British system, [[The Tyranny of Distance: How Distance Shaped Australia's History|distance from problems elsewhere in the world]], and other sorts of supposed prosperity.

Horne's intent in writing the book was to portray Australia's climb to power and wealth based almost entirely on luck rather than the strength of its political or [[Economy of Australia|economic system]], which Horne believed was "second rate". In addition to political and economic weaknesses, he also lamented on the lack of innovation and ambition, as well as a [[philistinism]] in the absence of art, among the Australian population, viewed by Horne as being complacent and indifferent to intellectual matters. He also commented on matters relating to Australian puritanism, as well as [[Conservative|conservatism]], particularly in relation to [[censorship]] and politics.

==Overview==
The title of Horne's book comes from the opening words of the book's last chapter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Australia is a lucky country run mainly by second rate people who share its luck. It lives on other people's ideas, and, although its ordinary people are adaptable, most of its leaders (in all fields) so lack curiosity about the events that surround them that they are often taken by surprise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9780143180029/lucky-country/39485/extract ''The Lucky Country'' – Introduction] to the sixth edition by [[Hugh Mackay (social researcher)|Hugh Mackay]] (extract), [[Penguin Modern Classics]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Horne's statement was an indictment of 1960s Australia. His intent was to comment that, while other [[industrialized nations]] created wealth using "clever" means such as [[technology]] and other innovations, Australia did not. Rather, Australia's economic prosperity was largely derived from its rich [[natural resources]] and immigration. Horne observed that Australia "showed less enterprise than almost any other prosperous industrial society."&lt;ref name="culture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/lucky-country|title=The Lucky Country|accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1976 follow-up book, ''Death of the Lucky Country'', Horne clarified what he had meant when he first coined the term:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I invented the phrase in 1964 to describe Australia, I said: 'Australia is a lucky country run by second rate people who share its luck.' I didn't mean that it had a lot of material resources … I had in mind the idea of Australia as a [British] derived society whose prosperity in the great age of manufacturing came from the luck of its historical origins … In the lucky style we have never 'earned' our democracy. We simply went along with some British habits.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the decades following his book's publication, Horne became critical of the "lucky country" phrase being used as a term of endearment for Australia. He commented, "I have had to sit through the most appalling rubbish as successive generations misapplied this phrase."

==Legacy==
The book became a phenomenon at its publication, despite some initially critical reviews. One commentator remarked that the release of the book was like "A bucket of cold saltwater emptied onto the belly of a dreaming sunbather".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Australia still the Lucky Country?|work=[[BBC News]]|date=31 October 2014|accessdate=27 June 2018|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-29844752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was published at a time when criticism of Australia, which had experienced an ascension to wealth and prosperity in a relatively short history (the country was federated in 1901), was rife. It is not the only book to shine an unfavourable light on the country: [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]]'s ''[[The Australian Ugliness]]'' was released four years earlier in 1960 and is considered a seminal work on Australian architecture. Boyd's book was an indictment on the taste of Australian suburbanites, and the aesthetic of the Australian suburbs, which he lamented was in a deplorable state, full of European imitation styles fused together to make one whole. 

Horne's book was given an unofficial sequel in 2016, with [[Ian Lowe]]'s ''The Lucky Country? Reinventing Australia''. Lowe's book addresses Horne's stance, and states that due to poor leadership, little has changed since ''The Lucky Country''.

With regard to economic innovation, Australia still ranks low: in 2014 ''[[The Economist]]'''s Economic Innovation Index ranked Australia 22nd, behind Japan, the US, Germany and Sweden.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

The division of [[human rights]] into '''three generations''' was initially proposed in 1979 by the [[Czech people|Czech]] jurist [[Karel Vasak]] at the [[International Institute of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]]. He used the term at least as early as November 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Vasak, "Human Rights: A Thirty-Year Struggle: the Sustained Efforts to give Force of law to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights", ''UNESCO Courier'' 30:11, Paris: [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]], November 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Vasak's theories have primarily taken root in European law.

His divisions follow the three watchwords of the [[French Revolution]]: ''[[Liberté, egalité, fraternité|Liberty, Equality, Fraternity]]''. The three generations are reflected in some of the rubrics of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] includes rights that are thought of as second generation as well as first generation ones, but it does not make the distinction in itself (the rights listed are not in specific order).

== First-generation human rights ==
First-generation human rights, sometimes called "blue" rights, deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life. They are fundamentally [[civil and political rights|civil and political]] in nature: They serve [[negative and positive rights|negatively to protect]] the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include, among other things, the [[right to life]], [[equality before the law]], [[freedom of speech]], the [[right to a fair trial]], [[freedom of religion]], and [[voting rights]]. They were pioneered by the [[United States]] [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and in [[France]] by the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in the 18th century, although some of these rights and the right to due process date back to the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 and the [[Rights of Englishmen]], which were expressed in the [[English Bill of Rights]] in 1689.

They were enshrined at the global level and given status in [[international law]] first by Articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and later in the 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In Europe, they were enshrined in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1953.

== Second-generation human rights ==
Second-generation human rights are related to equality and began to be recognized by governments after [[World War II]]. They are fundamentally [[economic, social and cultural rights|economic, social, and cultural]] in nature. They guarantee different members of the citizenry equal conditions and treatment. Secondary rights would include a [[right to work|right to be employed]] in [[decent work|just and favorable condition]], rights to [[right to food|food]], [[public housing|housing]] and [[universal health care|health care]], as well as [[social security]] and [[unemployment benefit]]s. Like first-generation rights, they were also covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and further embodied in Articles 22 to 28 of the Universal Declaration, and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]].

In the United States of America, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] proposed a [[Second Bill of Rights]], covering much the same grounds, during his State of the Union Address on January 11, 1944. Today, many nations, states, or groups of nations have developed legally binding declarations guaranteeing comprehensive sets of human rights, e.g. the [[European Social Charter]].

Some states have enacted some of these economic rights, e.g. the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] has enshrined the [[Campaign for Fiscal Equity#Campaign for Fiscal Equity.2C Inc. v. State|right to a free education]],&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Const. ART. XI, § 1, found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=**CNSA11S1+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=EXPLORER+&amp;TOKEN=14425895+&amp;TARGET=VIEW New York State Assembly website].

Retrieved February 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; in its [[constitutional law]].

These rights are sometimes referred to as "[[Red#Use by political movements|red]]" rights. They impose upon the government the duty to respect and promote and fulfill them, but this depends on the availability of resources. The duty is imposed on the state because it controls its own resources. No one has the direct [[right to housing]] and [[right to education]]. (In [[South Africa]], for instance, the right is not, ''per se'', to housing, but rather "to have access to adequate housing",&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa]], [[1996 in South Africa|1996]], s 26(1).&lt;/ref&gt; realised on a progressive basis.&lt;ref&gt;s s 26(2).&lt;/ref&gt;)

The duty of government is in the realization of these positive rights.

== Third-generation human rights ==
Third-generation human rights are those rights that go beyond the mere civil and social, as expressed in many progressive documents of [[international law]], including the 1972 [[Stockholm Declaration]] of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], the 1992 [[Rio Declaration]] on Environment and Development, and other pieces of generally aspirational "[[soft law]]". Because of the present-day tilting toward national [[sovereignty]] and the preponderance of would-be offender nations, these rights have been hard to enact in legally binding documents.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The term "third-generation human rights" remains largely unofficial, just as the also-used moniker of "[[Green politics|green]]" rights, and thus houses an extremely broad spectrum of rights, including:

* [[Group rights|Group]] and [[collective rights]]
* Right to [[self-determination]]
* [[right to development|Right to economic and social development]]
* Right to a [[healthy environment]]
* Right to [[natural resources]]
* Right to [[communication|communicate]] and [[Communication Rights|communication rights]]
* Right to participation in [[cultural heritage]]
* Rights to [[intergenerational equity]] and [[sustainability]]

The [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] ensures many of those: right to self-determination, right to development, right to natural resources and right to satisfactory environment.&lt;ref&gt;[[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], Article 20, 21, 22 and 24&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries also have constitutional mechanisms for safeguarding third-generation rights. For example, the Hungarian [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pieandcoffee.org/2010/02/26/sandor-fulop/ Notes: Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Eduskunta|Parliament of Finland]]'s [[Committee for the Future]], and the erstwhile [[Commission for Future Generations]] in the Knesset in Israel.

Some international organizations have offices for safeguarding such rights. An example is the [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]] of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. The [[Directorate-General for the Environment (European Commission)|Directorate-General for the Environment]] of the European Commission has as its mission "protecting, preserving and improving the environment for present and future generations, and promoting sustainable development".

A few jurisdictions have enacted provisions for [[environmental protection]], e.g. New York's "forever wild" constitutional article,&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Const. ART XIV, § 1.  Found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=**CNSA14S1+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=EXPLORER+&amp;TOKEN=08222978+&amp;TARGET=VIEW New York State Assembly website].

== Commentary ==
[[Maurice Cranston]] argued that [[scarcity]] means that supposed second-generation and third-generation rights are not really rights at all.&lt;ref&gt;Cranston, Maurice. "Human Rights: Real and Supposed," in ''Political Theory and the Rights of Man'', edited by D. D. Raphael (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1967), pp. 43-51.&lt;/ref&gt; If one person has a right, others have a duty to respect that right, but governments lack the resources necessary to fulfill the duties implied by citizens' supposed second- and third-generation rights.

Charles Kesler, a professor of government at [[Claremont McKenna College]] and senior fellow of the [[Claremont Institute]], has argued that second- and third-generation human rights serve as an attempt to cloak political goals, which the majority may well agree are good things in and of themselves, in the language of rights, and thus grant those political goals inappropriate connotations. In his opinion, calling socio-economic goods "rights" inherently creates a related concept of "[[duties]]", so that other citizens have to be coerced by the government to give things to other people in order to fulfill these new rights. He also has stated that, in the US, the new rights create a "nationalization" of political decision-making at the federal level in violation of federalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/47825927.html |title=Charles Kesler on the Grand Liberal Project |date=May 28, 2009 |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |publisher=''[[Uncommon Knowledge]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715094108/http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/47825927.html |archivedate=July 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Soft Despotism, Democracy's Drift'', Paul Rahe, the Charles O. Lee and Louise K. Lee Chair in Western Heritage at [[Hillsdale College]], wrote that focusing on equality-based rights leads to a subordination to the initial civil rights to an ever-expanding government, which would be too incompetent to provide for its citizens correctly and would merely seek to subordinate more rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/72025472.html |title=Soft Despotism with Paul Rahe |date=November 19, 2009 |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |publisher=''[[Uncommon Knowledge]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104072827/http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/72025472.html |archivedate=January 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th century philosopher [[Frederic Bastiat]] summarized the conflict between these [[negative and positive rights]] by saying:

{{quote|M. de Lamartine wrote me one day: "Your doctrine is only the half of my program; you have stopped at liberty; I go on to fraternity." I answered him: "The second half of your program will destroy the first half." And, in fact, it is quite impossible for me to separate the word "fraternity" from the word "voluntary". It is quite impossible for me to conceive of fraternity as legally enforced, without liberty being legally destroyed, and justice being legally trampled underfoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Economist [[F. A. Hayek]] has argued that the second generation concept of "[[social justice]]" cannot have any practical political meaning:

{{quote|No state of affairs as such is just or unjust: it is only when we assume that somebody is responsible for having brought it about ... In the same sense, a [[free market|spontaneously working market]], where prices act as guides to action, cannot take account of what people in any sense need or deserve, because it creates a distribution which nobody has designed, and something which has not been designed, a mere state of affairs as such, cannot be just or unjust. And the idea that things ought to be designed in a "just" manner means, in effect, that we must abandon the market and turn to a [[planned economy]] in which somebody decides how much each ought to have, and that means, of course, that we can only have it at the price of the complete abolition of personal liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reason.com/archives/1992/07/01/the-road-from-serfdom/4|publisher=''[[Reason Magazine|Reason]]''|accessdate=January 4, 2010|title=The Road from Serfdom: Forseeing the Fall|first=Thomas W.|last=Hazlett|date=July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[New York University School of Law]] professor of law [[Jeremy Waldron]] has written in response to critics of the second-generation rights:

{{quote|In any case, the argument from first-generation to second-generation rights was never supposed to be a matter of conceptual analysis. It was rather this: if one is really concerned to secure civil or political liberty for a person, that commitment should be accompanied by a further concern about the conditions of the person's life that make it possible for him to enjoy and exercise that liberty. Why on earth would it be worth fighting for this person's liberty (say, his liberty to choose between A and B) if he were left in a situation in which the choice between A and B meant nothing to him, or in which his choosing one rather than the other would have no impact on his life?"&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, 1993. Liberal Rights: Collected Papers, page 7, 1981–91. {{ISBN|0-521-43617-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[socialist]] and [[political economist]] [[Karl Polanyi]] made the antithetical argument to Hayek in the book ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]''. Polanyi wrote that an uncontrolled free market would lead to repressive economic concentration and then to a co-opting of democratic governance that degrades civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Karl Polanyi]]|title=[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|year=2001|ISBN=978-0-8070-5643-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Conference on Human Rights]] opposed the distinction between [[civil and political rights]] (negative rights) and [[economic, social and cultural rights]] (positive rights) that resulted in the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] proclaiming that "all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated".&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], Part I para 5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|Topicality (policy debate)||Topic (disambiguation)}}
{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}
'''Topicality''' is a [[stock issues|stock issue]] in [[policy debate]] which pertains to whether or not the [[plan (policy debate)|plan]] affirms the [[resolution (policy debate)|resolution]] as worded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prager|first=John|title=Introduction to Policy Debate, Chapter 11|url=http://webpages.charter.net/johnprager/IPD/Chapter11.htm|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To contest the topicality of the [[affirmative (policy debate)|affirmative]], the [[negative (policy debate)|negative]] interprets a word or words in the resolution and argues that the affirmative does not meet that definition, that the interpretation is preferable, and that non-topicality should be a voting issue.

==Structure of a Violation==
A topicality violation, as presented in the [[Structure of policy debate|1NC]], is generally as follows:
*'''Interpretation''' - Also known as "definition", interpretation of a word or words in the resolution, often supported by [[evidence (policy debate)|evidence]]. Evidence to support an interpretation can come from virtually any source (dictionary, legal dictionary, academic paper, laws, court rulings, etc.) and emphasis is placed on both the desirability of the interpretation and the quality of the evidence which supports the interpretation.
*'''Violation''' - Reason(s) why the plan does not meet the interpretation.
*'''Standards''' - Reason(s) why the interpretation is superior.
*'''Voting Issue''' - Reason(s) why the [[judge (policy debate)|judge]] should vote negative if the plan does not meet the interpretation.

==Commonly used Standards==
===Predictable limits===
Limits are a measure of how many cases would be topical under a given interpretation of the topic and whether that cleavage of cases is predictable.  Teams will often debate the desirability of having a small or large number of topical cases.

===Ground===
Ground is a measure of the quantity and quality of [[argument]]s and [[evidence (policy debate)|literature]] available to both teams under a certain [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of the topic. Teams will often debate the desirability of incorporating or excluding certain arguments.

===Brightline===
Brightline (sometimes called precision) is a measure of how clear the division is between topical and non-topical cases under a certain interpretation.

===Grammar===
[[Grammar]] is a measure of how grammatically correct an interpretation is. Some teams argue that grammar is key to the predictability of an interpretation.

===Education===
An Education standard asserts that the negative's interpretation of the resolution focuses the debate down to the most important area(s) for learning. This involves explaining why the topics and discussions preserved by the negative's interpretation are more important to the affirmative case and cases under the counterinterpretation.

===Effects (FX) Topicality===
Effects topicality alleges that the Affirmative team is not topical in its direct mandate(s) or intent, but only arrives at alleviating the Harms introduced by the Affirmative team typically associated with the topic through a variety of internal links. An example might be a case under a topic about limiting the use or stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction that declares war on North Korea or Iran. The Negative team would argue that such a case would only possibly be topical if it could be proven beyond a doubt not only that Iran or North Korea had weapons of mass destruction but also if such a war did not increase global proliferation pressures or involve the eventual use of weapons of mass destruction or did not lead to looting of such stockpiles, all very tendentious assumptions.

Negative teams will typically argue that such plans drastically abuse the resolution (i.e. allow too wide of a variety of cases to be run). Any case or plan could fall under the topic if enough causal links are allowed, and in running a Topicality attack, the Negative team states topicality should be decided based on a strict reading of the Affirmative plan text (whether or not it takes the stock issue of solvency into account). Affirmative teams will either argue that they are not effectual, that the plan's mandate directly falls under the rubric of the topic (though they may continue to claim remote advantages not typically associated with topical cases), or that effects topicality is acceptable.

===Extra-Topicality===
Extra-topicality is sometimes run in conjunction with FX, sometimes separately. The argument is that the Affirmative plan includes "planks" or components that are not topical. For example, a plan under an energy-conservation topic might both sign the Kyoto Protocol and increase general science funding across the board, obviously including energy conservation. Such a plan might then argue for environmental, economic or military benefits separate from anything having to do with energy conservation. A Negative team would argue that this would be extra-topical because the plan is acting in areas that are outside the boundaries of the resolution (therefore, "extra"-topicality). Either seriously or as an example, sometimes Negatives running against FX and Extra cases will run counterplans that they argue would be the truly topical version of the Affirmative  plan: For example, the Negative in the above case could run a counterplan wherein they only sign Kyoto. Negative teams will argue that the whole plan's mandate must be topical, as otherwise every Affirmative could run a different permutation of topical and non-topical components and make the topic literally unlimited. Affirmative teams will either argue that extra-topicality is legitimate or, much more frequently, that all components of their plan are in fact topical. A plan can arguably be extra-topical, not topical and FX-topical all at once: Its arguably topical plank may both not be topical no matter the causal links and rely on causal links to get to its arguable topicality, as well as having non-topical planks.

==Commonly asserted voting issues==
===Competing Interpretations===
Under the competing interpretations framework, if the negative presents a better interpretation than the affirmative's (which the affirmative does not meet), the negative wins. In other words, the affirmative's burden is to meet the best interpretation in the round. The usual affirmative answer is "reasonability", that is, that if the affirmative meets a good definition of the topic, the affirmative wins the debate, even if it isn't the best definition of the topic. In other words, the affirmative's burden is to meet some interpretation in the round that is sufficiently good.

===Fairness===
Some teams argue that it is unfair for the negative to have to debate a non-topical case and thus the judge should vote against one. This voting issue is sometimes referred to as "competitive equity."

===Education===
Some Negative teams argue that non-topical cases decrease the educational factor of a round. This is true. However, it should not constitute a real argument in and of itself; simply because the Affirmative team's plan is not the best provides no reason for the judge to vote against the Affirmative team.

===Jurisdiction===
Some teams argue that the judge only has the jurisdiction to vote for cases which affirm the resolution. This justification has largely fallen out of favor in collegiate debate after the 2001-2002 [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s topic led to large numbers of [[kritik]]s about how it was the issue and mindset of jurisdiction that destroyed Native American culture.

==Affirmative answers to Topicality==
Affirmatives can deploy a variety of answers to topicality violations in the [[Structure of policy debate|2AC]]. They can be generally categorized as follows:
*'''We Meet''' - The affirmative can argue that their case meets the negative's interpretation isn't ontological, only antiblackness is. 
*'''Counter-interpretation''' - The affirmative can offer a different interpretation of the word or words that the negative defined. The affirmative will usually argue that their interpretation is superior using the same standards outlined above, they can either use the standards that the negative used or present counterstandards.
*'''Non-voter''' - The affirmative can argue that the judge shouldn't vote negative even if they don't meet the negative's interpretation. This argument may be phrased as "reasonability", that the judge should accept the affirmative's case if it meets a reasonable interpretation of the resolution.
*'''Kritik''' - The affirmative can make critical arguments as to why topicality is an unnecessary and oppressive burden placed upon the affirmative.
*'''Reverse Voting Issue (RVI)''' - The affirmative can claim that the topicality argument offered by the negative is abusive in its own right and justifies an affirmative ballot. Judges do not find this argument very persuasive.
*'''Reasonability''' - The affirmative will argue that their plan does a "good enough" job of meeting the resolution and that it is unwarranted to reject them outright. They will argue that the negative has to prove that it has become impossible to prepare and argue against the affirmative's case. This is used to answer competing interpretations.

'''Uniting for Consensus''' ('''UfC''') is a movement, nicknamed the '''Coffee Club''', that developed in the 1990s in opposition to the possible expansion of permanent seats in the [[United Nations Security Council]]. Under the leadership of [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/200/41204.html |title=Players and Proposals in the Security Council Debate |author=Ayca Ariyoruk |date=3 July 2005 |publisher=[[Global Policy Forum]] |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iai.it/pdf/DocIAI/iaiwp1112.pdf |title=The European Union and the Reform of the UN Security Council: Toward a New Regionalism? |author=Nicoletta Pirozzi; Natalino Ronzitti |date=May 2011 |publisher=[[Istituto Affari Internazionali]] |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it aims to counter the bids for permanent seats proposed by [[G4 nations]] (Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan) and is calling for a consensus before any decision is reached on the form and size of the Security Council.

==History==
Italy, through the ambassador [[Francesco Paolo Fulci]], along with Pakistan, Mexico and Egypt, in 1995 founded the "Coffee Club".&lt;ref name="IAI0911"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iai.it/pdf/DocIAI/IAI0911.pdf |title=La riforma del Consiglio di Sicurezza dagli anni '90 ad oggi: problemi e prospettive |author=Pamela Preschern |year=2009 |publisher=[[Istituto Affari Internazionali]] |language=Italian |accessdate=3 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425124759/http://www.iai.it/pdf/DocIAI/IAI0911.pdf |archive-date=25 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four countries were united by a rejection of the proposal to increase number of [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members of the Security Council]], instead desiring to encourage the expansion of non-permanent seats. The founders of the group were soon joined by other countries, including Spain, Argentina, Turkey, Canada, and South Korea, and in a short time the group came to include about 50 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="IAI0911" /&gt; The thesis of the Uniting for Consensus group is that the increase of permanent seats would have further accentuated the disparity between the member countries and resulted in the extension of a series of privileges with a [[cascade effect]]. The new permanent members would have in fact benefited from the method of electing, which is particularly advantageous in a number of specific organs of the [[United Nations System]] {{Clarify|date=May 2018}}.

After having agreed with the need to increase the representativeness of the Security Council, in 2005 during the 59th session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the UfC group — led by the representatives of Canada, Italy, Colombia and Pakistan — made a proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/ga10371.doc.htm |title=Uniting for Consensus group of States introduces text on Security Council reform to General Assembly |date=26 July 2005 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that centres on an enlargement of the number of non-permanent members from ten to twenty. The non-permanent members would be elected by the General Assembly for a two-year term and would be eligible for immediate re-election, subject to the decision of their respective geographical groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reform of the United Nations |author=Kulwant Rai Gupta |year=2006 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors |location=[[New Delhi]] |isbn=81-269-0668-5 |page=232 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j2R18roKQ6IC&amp;pg=PA232 |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other members and co-sponsors of the text, entitled "Reform of the Security Council", were listed as Argentina, Costa Rica, Malta, Mexico, San Marino, South Korea, Spain and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/59/L.68 |title=Draft resolution: Reform of the Security Council |date=21 July 2005 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the proposal was not accepted, the initiative found broad consensus among member states, including permanent member China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china-un.org/eng/chinaandun/zzhgg/t191026.htm |title=Remarks by Ambassador Wang Guangya at Meeting on Uniting for Consensus |date=11 April 2005 |publisher=Permanent mission of the PRC to the UN |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 2009, Colombia and Italy, acting as representatives of the UfC group, provided a new model of reform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.italyun.esteri.it/NR/rdonlyres/C37FC89F-8132-4CA8-A2F9-149515B37BD1/0/2009_04_17screform.pdf |title=Security Council reform |date=17 April 2009 |publisher=Permanent mission of Italy to the UN |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was presented as a concrete attempt to reach a deal. The document proposed creating a new category of seats, still non-permanent, but elected for an extended duration (3 to 5 years terms) without the possibility of immediate re-elections. This new kind of seat would not be allocated to single national countries but rather to regional groups on a rotational basis. As far as traditional categories of seats are concerned, the UfC proposal does not imply any change, but only the introduction of small and medium size states among groups eligible for regular seats. This proposal includes even the question of [[veto]], giving a range of options that goes from abolition to limitation of the application of the veto only to [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII]] matters.

During the last round, Italy firmly rejected the G4 proposal as well as the [[African Union]] one and even denounced the unfair behaviour of G4 countries. According to Italy, the G4 is attempting to exclude the UfC proposal from the floor, “on the basis of a presumed level of support”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.italyun.esteri.it/Rappresentanza_ONU/Menu/Comunicazione/Archivio_News/2009_09_02+meeting+GA.htm |title=Meeting of the informal plenary of the General Assembly on the question of the Security Council and related matters |date=2 September 2009 |publisher=Permanent mission of Italy to the UN |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Italy believes that it has shown flexibility by putting forward a new proposal on April 2009, while the G4 remained tied to its 2005 document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.affarinternazionali.it/articolo.asp?ID=1161 |title=L'Italia e la riforma del Consiglio di Sicurezza dell’Onu |author=Nicoletta Pirozzi |date=10 June 2009 |publisher=[[Istituto Affari Internazionali]] |language=Italian |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's active role in current discussions started in February 2009 before the beginning of intergovernmental negotiations, when Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Franco Frattini]] hosted more than 75 countries to develop a shared path towards a reform of the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Italy+hosts+ministerial+meeting+on+UNSC+reform+in+Rome.-a0200796959 |title=Italy hosts ministerial meeting on UNSC reform in Rome |date=5 February 2009 |publisher=[[Kyodo News]] |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 2011, the members states which have participated in the group meeting held in [[Rome]] rose to 120.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esteri.it/MAE/EN/Sala_Stampa/ArchivioNotizie/Approfondimenti/2011/05/20110516_rifonu.htm?LANG=EN |title=Riforma ONU: Frattini, il Consiglio di Sicurezza sia più rappresentativo |date=16 May 2011 |publisher=[[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs]] |language=Italian |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2011/05/15/news/consiglio_di_sicurezza_onu_roma_con_120_voti_sfida_berlino-16271793/ |title=Consiglio di sicurezza Onu: Roma con 120 voti sfida Berlino |author=Vincenzo Nigro |date=15 May 2011 |publisher=[[La Repubblica]] |language=Italian |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vaughan Foods beheading incident''' occurred on September 24, 2014, when a man attacked two employees at the [[Reser's Fine Foods|Vaughan Foods]] food processing plant in [[Moore, Oklahoma]], United States, with a knife. Colleen Hufford was beheaded, while another employee, Traci Johnson, was stabbed and critically injured. The suspect identified as Alton Nolen who was fired from the plant prior to the attack, was then shot and wounded by Vaughan Foods Chief Operating Officer Mark Vaughan.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/26/alton-nolan-beheads-cowor_n_5888500.html|last=Murdock|first=Sebastian|title=Alton Nolen Allegedly Beheads Oklahoma Coworker After Firing|date=September 26, 2014|accessdate=July 26, 2016|publisher=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/26/us/oklahoma-beheading/index.html|title=Police: FBI probing past of Okla. beheading suspect - CNN.com|author=Greg Botelho, CNN|date=September 26, 2014|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americas1stfreedom.org/articles/2015/5/5/mark-vaughan-nra-leo-of-the-year/|last=Chesnut|first=Mark|date=May 5, 2015|publisher=NRA|title=Mark Vaughan: NRA LEO Of The Year|work=America's 1st Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alton Nolen was charged with [[first-degree murder]] and assault and battery with a deadly weapon, while facing possible federal charges as well.&lt;ref name="1st-degree murder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beheading Suspect"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/alton-nolen-oklahoma-beheading-suspect-described-as-a-little-odd/|title=Alton Nolen, Oklahoma beheading suspect, described as "a little odd"|accessdate=July 26, 2016|date=September 27, 2014|website=cbsnews.com|publisher=CBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oklahoma man charged with murder in beheading"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/oklahoma-man-charged-murder-beheading-154028051.html|last=Murphy|first=Sean|date=September 30, 2014|title=Oklahoma man charged with murder in beheading|work=Yahoo News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002095924/https://news.yahoo.com/oklahoma-man-charged-murder-beheading-154028051.html|archive-date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack came to national attention due to its gruesome nature, which followed a well-publicized [[2014 ISIL beheading incidents|recent series of beheadings]] carried out by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ]] (ISIS).&lt;ref name="Horrifying Violence"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCoy|first1=Terrence|date=June 13, 2014|title=ISIS, beheadings and the success of horrifying violence|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/06/13/Isis-beheadings-and-the-success-of-horrifying-violence/|website=The Washington Post - Morning Mix|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolen was convicted of murder and assault in October 2017.

== Attack ==
On September 24, 2014, a Vaughan Foods employee identified as Alton Nolen was suspended from his job in suburban [[Oklahoma City]]  after one of the victims (Traci Johnson) initiated a complaint against him following an argument "about [Nolen] not liking white people," according to Cleveland County Prosecutor Greg Mashburn.&lt;ref name="WWKAltonNolen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/30/what-we-know-about-alton-nolen-who-has-been-charged-with-murder-in-the-oklahoma-beheading-case/|title=What we know about Alton Nolen, who has been charged with murder in the Oklahoma beheading case|author=Abby Ohlheiser|accessdate=July 26, 2016|date=September 30, 2014|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately afterwards, he went home to retrieve a knife and placed it inside his shoe. He then drove to the plant's main distribution center, crashed into a parked car,&lt;ref name="Oklahoma man charged with murder in beheading"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oklahoma beheading: Alton Nolen charged with murder"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29436269|title=Oklahoma beheading: Alton Nolen charged with murder|work=BBC News|date=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entered the front administrative office area. There, according to detectives, he attacked a female employee (Colleen Hufford) from behind with the knife, first slashing her throat and then beheading her.&lt;ref name="Beheading Suspect"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/09/27/woman-beheaded-at-oklahoma-food-distribution-center-police-say/|title=Oklahoma beheading: FBI probing suspect's recent conversion to Islam|work=Fox News|date=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other coworkers tried to stop him during the assault by kicking him and throwing chairs at him. He proceeded to slash the throat and face of another female employee, Traci Johnson, intending to behead her as well.

'''Alton Alexander Nolen''' (born August 16, 1984), at the time age 30, was identified as the sole perpetrator in the attack.  He worked as a production line employee at Vaughan Foods before being suspended.  He was charged with assault and battery on a police officer after being pulled over in 2010 for having a suspended license plate. He fled, sparking a massive manhunt that lasted for twelve hours. Nolen was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released on March 2013 after serving two years and ordered to attend an anger management course. He was also convicted of cocaine possession with the intent to distribute during the following year.&lt;ref name="Beheading Suspect"/&gt;

Nolen had been suspended from his job prior to the attack due to "personnel issues", although specific details still remain unclear.&lt;ref name="1st-degree murder"/&gt;  Injured victim Traci Johnson later claimed it was from an altercation she had with him when he stated he "did not like white people".&lt;ref name="Oklahoma man charged with murder in beheading"/&gt;  The weapon he used in the attack was a 10-inch work knife used by employees to cut lettuce and other vegetables, allegedly acquired from his home.&lt;ref name="Oklahoma man charged with murder in beheading"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oklahoma Woman Beheaded: FBI Investigates Suspect Alton Nolen, Reportedly Attemped To Convert Co-Workers To Islam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/oklahoma-woman-beheaded-fbi-investigates-suspect-alton-nolen-reportedly-attemped-convert-1695686|title=Oklahoma Woman Beheaded: FBI Investigates Suspect Alton Nolen, Reportedly Attemped To Convert Co-Workers To Islam|author=Alessandria Masi|date=26 September 2014|work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  County District Attorney Greg Mashburn, noted that Nolen reportedly had three specific targets for the attack, including Johnson.&lt;ref name="Alton Nolen likely to face death penalty for beheading Oklahoma co-worker, trying to behead other: DA"/&gt; The other two reported targets were not hurt during the incident. Nolen was shot and stopped by the company's Chief Operating Officer, a reserve deputy who happened to be armed.&lt;ref name="Fox6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox6now.com/2014/10/02/prosecutor-will-seek-death-penalty-for-alton-nolen-in-oklahoma-workplace-beheading/|title=Prosecutor will seek death penalty for Alton Nolen in Oklahoma workplace beheading|date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=July 26, 2016|publisher=FOX6Now.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic connection ===
The motive for the attack was initially unclear, as it was not known if the suspect's beliefs played a role in the attack.&lt;ref name=MSNBC1/&gt;&lt;ref name=KFOR/&gt;  In their search warrant requests, police reported that witnesses had stated "Nolen had several previous disagreements and arguments with employees," while describing him as becoming increasingly violent, disrespectful, and aggressive towards his co-workers.  "Witnesses also had overheard Nolen saying that he did not like and beat Caucasians."  Nolen had also "recently converted to the Islam religion and was attempting to convince other employees to convert to the religion," and that Nolen had become aggressive and belligerent to other employees, while wanting others to call him 'Muhammad.'&lt;ref name="NewsOK1"/&gt;

However, prosecutors noted that Nolen had demonstrated an "infatuation" with beheadings.  Because of the brutal manner of death and the fact that the attack followed a series of high-profile videotaped [[2014 ISIL beheading incidents|beheadings carried out by Islamic State]] (ISIS) militants in the [[Middle East]], Moore police asked the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to assist in the investigation.&lt;ref name="WWKAltonNolen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RememberVictim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/10/03/friends-and-family-gather-to-remember-oklahoma-beheading-victim-back-fundraiser/|date=October 3, 2014|title=Friends and family gather to remember Oklahoma beheading victim, back fundraiser to aid family|publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FBI was also investigating the attack because Nolen "was saying Arabic terms in the attack," according to County Prosecutor Greg Mashburn.&lt;ref name="Fox6"/&gt;  Although Nolen attended a [[Baptist]] church as a youth, Oklahoma prison system records listed his religion as [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="NewsOK1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clay|first1=Nolan|title=Oklahoma murder defendant accused of beheading wanted to be called 'Muhammad,' police reported|url=http://newsok.com/article/5347678|website=The Oklahoman|publisher=NewsOK|accessdate=July 26, 2016|date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FBI officials confirmed that their investigation included whether Nolen's recent conversion to Islam was somehow linked to the crime.&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt;  Moore Police Sgt. Jeremy Lewis confirmed his department's request for FBI help investigating Nolen's background.  Oklahoma prison records also show that Nolen, who has a previous criminal record, has a tattoo reading "Assalamu Alaikum", an Arabic greeting that translates to "Peace be with you".&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

After his arrest, news websites published information from his [[Facebook]] page, in which he calls himself "Jah'Keem Yisrael" and uploaded photos of himself reading the Koran and wearing Muslim religious clothing.&lt;ref name="'SHARIA LAW IS COMING!!!!' Oklahoma Beheader Celebrated Terrorists, Disparaged Non-Muslims On Facebook"/&gt; His online posts were often related to Islamist interests, condemning the United States and [[Israel]], also claiming that [[Sharia|sharia law]] was coming.

Using his Islamic name, "Jah'Keem Yisrael" his Facebook page featured photos of the [[Taliban]], [[Osama bin Laden]], as well as an image of a partially decapitated man with someone standing over him pulling his head back to show the wound. A photo of the [[September 11 attacks]] was shown with the caption:

Patrick T. Dunleavy, former deputy inspector general of the New York State Police Criminal Intelligence Unit and author of ''The Fertile Soil of Jihad: Terrorism's Prison Connection'', calls it likely that Alton's actions were the result of radicalization.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman&gt;{{cite news|last1=McKay|first1=Hollie|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Malia|title=ISIS flag, radical manifesto raise questions about Calif. campus stabber's motive|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/11/10/uc-merced-stabber-had-isis-flag-among-his-belongings-report-says/|accessdate=November 11, 2015|publisher=Fox News|date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saad Mohammed, director of information for the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City, confirmed that Alton Nolen began worshipping at the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City (ISGOC) mosque in May and that he has seen him there several times since.  A picture on Nolan's Facebook page shows him attending the mosque on September 5, 2014, nineteen days before the attack and murder. Although, he claimed Nolen wasn't outgoing and those who attended the same mosque as he did described his behavior as "a little odd" and "a little weird", nonetheless his behavior didn't raise any red flags.  Mohammed said that Nolen's actions did not reflect the beliefs of Islam.&lt;ref name="Beheading Suspect"/&gt;

== Legal proceedings ==
On September 30, Nolen was charged with first-degree murder and assault and battery with a deadly weapon.&lt;ref name="WWKAltonNolen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oklahoma man charged with murder in beheading"/&gt;  According to police, he "openly admitted" to killing Hufford and injuring Johnson during the attack.&lt;ref name="Oklahoma beheading: Alton Nolen charged with murder"/&gt; Prosecutors are expected to pursue the death penalty in the case.&lt;ref name="Alton Nolen likely to face death penalty for beheading Oklahoma co-worker, trying to behead other: DA"/&gt; A preliminary hearing was scheduled for October 14,&lt;ref name="Prosecutors will seek death penalty against Alton Nolen for beheading co-worker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-okla-beheading-suspect-article-1.1961177|last=Hensley|first=Nicole |date=October 2, 2014|title=Prosecutors will seek death penalty against Alton Nolen for beheading co-worker|publisher=nydailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was later rescheduled to December 2 due to a scheduling conflict with Nolen's lawyers.&lt;ref name="Nolen's court appearance delayed"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Regier|first1=Andy|url=http://www.normantranscript.com/news/article_c3e40eda-4fed-11e4-8926-3311fd31c68a.html|title=Nolen's court appearance delayed|date=October 9, 2014|publisher=The Norman Transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rescheduled again to April 2015.&lt;ref name="Vaughan Foods Survivor Speaks Out"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news9.com/story/27599922/vaughan-foods-survivor-speaks-out|title=Vaughan Foods Survivor Speaks Out|author=Lisa Monahan|date=December 10, 2014|publisher=news9.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary hearing was delayed again until June 10,&lt;ref name="NewsOK2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/judge-orders-mental-competency-evaluation-in-moore-beheading-case/article/5404512|date=March 25, 2015|last=Clay|first=Nolan|title=Judge Orders Mental Competency Evaluation|publisher=NewsOK}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was postponed again until July 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.normantranscript.com/news/courts_crime_police/courts-waiting-on-competency-evaluation-for-man-accused-of-beheading/article_64b3cc1c-865f-5290-8bfa-609d1b5dbf1a.html|date=June 10, 2015|last=Bruha|first=Jessica|title=Courts waiting on competency evaluation for man accused of beheading in Moore|publisher=The Norman Transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 15, 2015, a competency trial for Nolen was set for October 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/competency-trial-is-set-for-man-accused-of-beheading-co-worker/article/5447038|date=September 15, 2015|last=Clay|first=Nolan|title=Competency trial is set for man accused of beheading co-worker|publisher=NewsOK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2015, District Judge Lori Walkley ruled that Alton Nolen was competent to stand trial. He is accused of beheading co-worker Colleen Hufford, and nearly beheading Traci Johnson, a second co-worker, who survived her injuries.  He also faces four assault and battery charges for threatening or assaulting co-workers with a knife.

On August 17, 2016, an Oklahoma judge ruled that Nolen was not competent to enter a guilty plea in his murder case. The state mental hospital in Vinita is handling Nolen's treatment and evaluation.

{{Politics of Iraq}}

[[Iraq]] has three '''vice presidents''' or '''deputy presidents''', although a debate is ongoing about a [[political reform]] to abolish their posts.

The office of Vice-President was historically largely ceremonial but prestigious. In post-war Iraq, the [[Constitution of Iraq]], in its "Transitional Guidelines," creates a three-member [[Presidency Council of Iraq|Presidency (or Presidential) Council]], consisting of the [[President of Iraq|President of the Republic]] and two deputy presidents, who must act in unison. The Presidency Council had three members to accommodate Iraq's three largest groups: [[Sunni]] Muslim Arabs, [[Shiite]] Muslim Arabs, and the mostly Sunni [[Kurds]]. As a unit, the Presidency Council was meant to symbolize the unity of the nation. This arrangement is required by the constitution to continue until the [[Council of Representatives of Iraq|Council of Representatives]], enters its second set of sessions. At this point, the Presidency Council would be replaced by a solitary President of the Republic, who would have only one deputy, the Vice-President. In any case, the Presidency is appointed by the Council of Representatives.

The three-member arrangement was a hold-over from the [[Iraqi interim government]] and the [[Iraqi Transitional Government]].

On 13 May 2011, three vice-presidents were elected.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90854/7379161.html&lt;/ref&gt; On July 11, 2011, [[Adil Abdul-Mahdi]] resigned after he had presented his resignation to [[President of Iraq|President]] [[Jalal Talabani]] on May 30, 2011. &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130218053057/http://en.aswataliraq.info/(S(dhb2p22a42qvlc3bv0ffrhq1))/Default.aspx?page=article_page&amp;c=slideshow&amp;id=142843 (''Al-Aswat'')]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2011-07-11-iraq-vice-president-resigns_n.htm (''USA Today'')]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2014, three new Vice Presidents were elected: former Prime Ministers [[Nouri al-Maliki]] and [[Ayad Allawi]] and former [[List of Speakers of the Council of Representatives of Iraq|Speaker of Parliament]] [[Osama al-Nujaifi]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

On August 11, 2015 the Council of Representatives approved the [[Al Abadi Government|al Abadi government]] plan to abolish the posts of both Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/08/14/premature-excitement-about-iraqs-new-government-reforms/|title=Premature excitement about Iraq’s new government reforms|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Osama al-Nujaifi filed a complaint against the decision, considering it to be against the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/iraq-vice-president-files-court-case-keep-post-521531666|title=Iraq vice president files court case to keep his post|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also Nuri al-Maliki promised to cling to his post.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aawsat.com/2015/09/article55344978/iraq-maliki-nujaifi-say-pms-decision-to-cancel-vice-president-posts-unconstitutional|title=Iraq: Maliki, Nujaifi say PM’s decision to cancel vice president posts “unconstitutional”|first=Asharq|last=Al-awsat|date=1 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October 2016, the three posts of Vice President were restored by the [[Supreme Court of Iraq]] which deemed their abolition unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="restored"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-10/11/c_135744075.htm|title=Iraqi court nullifies Abadi's earlier decision to sack 3 vice president posts|publisher=Xinhua|date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of officeholders==

===Under [[Iraqi Republic (1958–68)|Iraqi Republic]] and [[Ba'athist Iraq]]===

The [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'athist regime]] of [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] also used the office of Vice President. However, the post was not as influential as the Vice Chairmen of the [[Revolutionary Command Council (Iraq)|Revolutionary Command Council]]. Vice Presidents were appointed at the discretion of the President.
