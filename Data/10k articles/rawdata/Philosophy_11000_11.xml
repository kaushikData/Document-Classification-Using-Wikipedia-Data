'''''A Philosopher by lamplight''''' (also known as '''''A Hermit Studying Anatomy''''') is a painting by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]]. It is not known when Wright painted the picture, but it was first exhibited in 1769 in London with the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]]. This was one of the earliest of many lamplight or candlelight paintings and portraits for which Wright is famed.

== Description ==

This picture was described in the catalogue of the 1801 sale as a companion to ''[[The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus]]''. Each has a main figure in the foreground with two subsidiary ones behind, both are night scenes and show old men engaged in scientific research.&lt;ref name="Nicolson 1968"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Benedict|title=Joseph Wright of Derby: Painter of light, Volume 1|year=1968|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|author2=Mellon, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows an old man who is thought to be a philosopher or a pilgrim,examining a collection of human bones in a lamp-lit cave. Two smaller men, or boys, dressed as pilgrims (as identified by the [[Shell of Saint James|scallop shells]] in their hats: the emblem of St James) seem to be approaching him. The size of these figures is a lot smaller than the main character in the painting. Outside the cave the dark landscape is lit by the moonlight breaking through the clouds. Shells were the sign of pilgrims but they were also the emblem of the Darwin family which included [[Erasmus Darwin]] who was a leading member of the [[Lunar Society]] and [[Derby Philosophical Society]] which linked key men in the age of enlightenment.
[[File:Demokrit, hensunken i betragtninger.jpg|thumb|left|100px|''Democritus in Meditation'' by [[Salvator Rosa]].]]
Experts believe that this painting was based on [[Salvator Rosa]]'s ''Democritus in Meditation''. Wright’s friend [[John Hamilton Mortimer]] was a follower of Rosa’s so it is possible that Wright would have seen Rosa's work or an engraving of it.&lt;ref name="Derby Museums page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art treasure - A Hermit |url=http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureAHermit.htm |accessdate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425222633/http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureAHermit.htm |archivedate=25 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Democritus was a Greek philosopher who is remembered for making fun of the foolishness of mankind.

Though the painting's subtitle is ''A Hermit Studying Anatomy'', his attitude towards the bones he is holding does not suggest particularly serious scrutiny. He is surrounded by symbols of the ephemeral nature of the human condition which include the skeleton, a lamp that will burn all its fuel, the moon which has to be reborn every four weeks and an hour glass. The moon was also the symbol of the [[Lunar Society]] which Wright was strongly associated with although he never became a member.

The preoccupation of the philosopher and trepidation of the two pilgrims may be a reflection on concerns about the new scientific understanding and [[The Enlightenment|enlightenment at the time]] Wright lived.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== Issues==
There are scholars and theologians who consider only the original autographs of Scripture as infallible and as final authority, while others hold more to what is called the "Ecclesiastical Text" view, that [[Bible Canon|Scripture canon]] is also authoritative in various renderings in later copies or [[Bible manuscript#Textual criticism|manuscript traditions]], or established "apo-grapha" (meaning "copied-writings"), and not just the [[Biblical manuscript|original autographs]] alone. The reason being that the "original autographs" no longer actually exist, in tangible extant form, so later verified copies of copies, or "apographa", are the only real tangible or present "canon" that we have, and providentially preserved for current knowledge.  And that the "apographa" or "Ecclesiastical Text" is all that is really available and should be mainly considered realistically, from established and accepted confessions, church traditions, revivals, productivity, understandings, and interpretations, and should be all that is accepted reasonably, efficiently, or sufficiently, for study or edification.&lt;ref&gt; Dr. Jeffrey Khoo - [http://www.deanburgonsociety.org/Preservation/sola.htm SOLA AUTOGRAPHA OR SOLA APOGRAPHA?

MacDonald, Jr. - [https://ajmacdonaldjr.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/the-ecclesiastical-text/ The Ecclesiastical Text] - wordpress.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theologians and scholars hold to what's called the "Critical Text" position,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gotquestions.org/critical-text.html  Question: "What is the Critical Text?"] - GotQuestions.org.&lt;/ref&gt; such as put forth by [[Westcott and Hort]], that seeks to find out and put forth what the original Apostles and Prophets actually wrote, regardless of later tradition or confessional history, or "majority text" views.&lt;ref name="gotquestions critical text"&gt;[https://www.gotquestions.org/verbal-plenary-preservation.html What is Verbal Plenary Preservation?] - GotQuestions.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Westcott and Hort's work, according to Bible scholar and translator [[Bruce M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3339">[[File:Aristarchus of Samothrace.JPG|thumb|Aristarchus of Samothrace, detail from: ''Apotheosis of Homer'' (1827) by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] (1780–1867)]]
'''Aristarchus of Samothrace''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀρίσταρχος ὁ Σαμόθραξ}}; c. 220 &amp;ndash; c. 143 BC) was a [[Philologist|grammarian]] noted as the most influential of all scholars of [[Homer]]ic poetry. He was the [[librarian]] of the [[Library of Alexandria|library]] [[Alexandria|of Alexandria]] and seems to have succeeded his teacher [[Aristophanes of Byzantium|Aristophanes]] [[Byzantium|of Byzantium]] in that role.

He left Samothrace island at a young age and went to [[Alexandria]]  where he studied with the director of the [[Library of Alexandria|library]]. Later at first he was a teacher at the Royal courtyard and then director of the library from 153 to 145 BC. After he was persecuted by his disciple Ptolemy the Benefactor, he found refuge in [[Cyprus]] where he died. 

It said that Aristarchus had a remarkable memory and was completely indifferent as to his external appearance.

He established the most historically important critical edition of the Homeric poems, and he is said to have applied his teacher's accent system to it, pointing the texts with a careful eye for metrical correctness. His rejection of doubtful lines&lt;ref&gt;Cic. ad Fam. iii.11.5, ix.10.1; in Pis. 30.73&lt;/ref&gt; made his severity proverbial.&lt;ref&gt;Hor. A. P. 450&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that he, or more probably, another predecessor at Alexandria, [[Zenodotus]], was responsible for the division of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' into twenty-four books each. According to the ''[[Suda]]'', Aristarchus wrote 800 treatises ({{lang|grc|ὑπομνήματα}}) on various topics; these are all lost but for fragments preserved in the various ''[[scholia]].'' His works cover such writers as Alcaeus, Anacreon, Pindar, Hesiod, and the tragedians.

Accounts of his death vary, though they agree that it was during the persecutions of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy VIII]] [[Ptolemaic Egypt|of Egypt]]. One account has him, having contracted an incurable [[Edema|dropsy]], starving himself to death while in exile on [[Cyprus]].

He modified the system of the ancient Greek textual signs (''semeia'') and from some point on these signs were called [[Aristarchian symbols]]. The historical connection of his name to [[literary criticism]] has created the term '''''aristarch''''' for someone who is a judgmental critic.

'''Blitz BASIC''' refers to the [[programming language]] dialect that was interpreted by the first Blitz compilers, devised by [[New Zealand]]-based developer Mark Sibly. Being derived from [[BASIC]], Blitz syntax was designed to be easy to pick up for beginners first learning to program.  The languages are game-programming oriented but are often found general-purpose enough to be used for most types of application. The Blitz language evolved as new products were released, with recent incarnations offering support for more advanced programming techniques such as [[object-oriented programming|object-orientation]] and [[Multithreading (software)|multi-threading]].  This led to the languages losing their BASIC moniker in later years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blitzbasic.com|title=The Official Blitz Website|website=www.blitzbasic.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331013346/http://www.blitzbasic.com/|archivedate=31 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The first iteration of the Blitz language was created for the [[Amiga]] platform and published by the [[Australia]]n firm Memory and Storage Technology.  Returning to [[New Zealand]], Blitz BASIC 2 was published several years later by Acid Software (a local Amiga game publisher).  Since then, Blitz compilers have been released on several [[Platform (computing)|platforms]]. Following the demise of the Amiga as a commercially viable platform, the Blitz BASIC 2 source code was released to the Amiga community. Development continues to this day under the name AmiBlitz.

=== BlitzBasic ===
[[Idigicon]] published BlitzBasic for [[Microsoft Windows]] in October 2000.  The language included a built-in API for performing basic 2D graphics and audio operations. Following the release of Blitz3D, BlitzBasic is often synonymously referred to as Blitz2D.

Recognition of BlitzBasic increased when a limited range of "free" versions were distributed in popular UK computer magazines such as [[PC Format]]. This resulted in a legal dispute between the developer and publisher which was eventually resolved amicably.

=== BlitzPlus ===
In February 2003, Blitz Research Ltd. released BlitzPlus also for Microsoft Windows. It lacked the 3D engine of Blitz3D, but did bring new features to the 2D side of the language by implementing limited Microsoft Windows control support for creating native [[GUI]]s.  Backwards compatibility of the 2D engine was also extended, allowing compiled BlitzPlus games and applications to run on systems that might only have [[DirectX]] 1.

=== BlitzMax ===

The first BlitzMax compiler was released in December 2004 for [[Mac OS X]]. This made it the first Blitz dialect that could be compiled on *nix platforms. Compilers for Microsoft Windows and [[Linux]] were subsequently released in May 2005. BlitzMax brought the largest change of language structure to the modern range of Blitz products by extending the type system to include object-oriented concepts and modifying the graphics API to better suit [[OpenGL]]. BlitzMax was also the first of the Blitz languages to represent strings internally using [[UCS2]], allowing native-support for string literals composed of non-[[ASCII]] characters.

BlitzMax's platform-agnostic command-set allows developers to compile and run source code on multiple platforms. However the official compiler and build chain will only generate binaries for the platform that it is executing on. Unofficially, users have been able to get Linux and Mac OS X to cross-compile to the Windows platform.

BlitzMax is also the first [[modularity (programming)|modular]] version of the Blitz languages, improving the extensibility of the command-set. In addition, all of the standard modules shipped with the compiler are open-source and so can be tweaked and recompiled by the programmer if necessary. The official BlitzMax [[cross-platform]] [[GUI]] module (known as MaxGUI) allows developers to write GUI interfaces for their applications on Linux ([[FLTK]]), Mac ([[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]]) and Windows.

In October 2007, BlitzMax 1.26 was released which included the addition of a [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]] module.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=72891#814878|title=BlitzMax update 1.26 now available!|website=www.blitzbasic.com|access-date=11 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526130312/http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=72891#814878|archive-date=26 May 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BlitzMax 1.32 shipped new [[thread (computer science)|threading]] and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] scripting modules and most of the standard library functions have been updated so that they are [[unicode]] friendly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=83917#947391 BlitzMax V132 for Windows and MacIntel now up!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526130325/http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=83917#947391 |date=26 May 2011 }} on blitzbasic.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blitz3D SDK ===
Blitz3D SDK is a 3D graphics engine based on the engine in Blitz3D. It was marketed for use with [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], BlitzMax and [[PureBasic]], however it could also be used with other languages that follow compatible calling conventions. A game example for Blitz3d is [[SCP – Containment Breach]] which was made with Blitz3d

=== Max3D module ===
In 2008, the source code to Max3D - a C++-based cross-platform 3D engine - was released under a [[BSD license]]. This engine focused on OpenGL but had an abstract backend for other graphics drivers (such as DirectX) and made use of several open-source libraries, namely [[Assimp]], [[Boost C++ Libraries|Boost]] and [[Open Dynamics Engine|ODE]].

Despite the excitement in the Blitz community of Max3D being the eagerly awaited successor to Blitz3D, interest and support died off soon after the source code was released and eventually development came to a halt. There is no indication that Blitz Research will pick up the project again.

=== Open-source release ===
BlitzPlus was released as [[Open Source]] on 28 April 2014 under the [[zlib license]] on [[github.com]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Home/_index_.php BlitzPlus Source Code Released] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716133612/http://www.blitzbasic.com/Home/_index_.php |date=16 July 2016 }} by simonh (2014-04-29)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=102907 Blitz3D open sourced!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906075242/http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=102907 |date=6 September 2016 }} on Blitz3D Forums by (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Blitz3D followed soon after and was released as Open Source on 3 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Home/_index_.php Blitz3D Now Free and Open Source!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716133612/http://www.blitzbasic.com/Home/_index_.php |date=16 July 2016 }} by simonh (2014-08-03)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/blitz-research/blitz3d blitz3d] on github.com&lt;/ref&gt; BlitzMax was later released as Open Source on 21 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/blitz-research/blitzmax blitzmax] on github.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample code==
The following code creates a windowed application that shows the current time in binary and decimal format. This code is written in BlitzBasic, but will compile and run in both Blitz3D and BlitzPlus. See below for the same example written in BlitzMax.

==Legacy==
In 2011, BRL released a new cross-platform programming language called [[Monkey (programming language)|Monkey]] and its first official module called Mojo. Monkey has a similar syntax to BlitzMax, but instead of compiling direct to assembly code, it translates Monkey source files directly into [[source code]] for a chosen language, framework or platform e.g. Windows, [[Mac OS X]], [[iOS]], Android, [[HTML5]], and [[Adobe Flash]].

Development of Monkey has been halted in favor of monkey2, an updated version of the language by Mark Sibly.

{{Chinese |t = 義和團運動 |s = {{Linktext|义|和|团|运动}} |p = Yìhétuán Yùndòng |l = Militia United in Righteousness Movement}}

The '''Boxer Rebellion''' ({{lang|zh-hant|拳亂}}), '''Boxer Uprising''', or '''Yihetuan Movement''' ({{lang|zh-hant|義和團運動}}) was an anti-foreign, [[anti-colonial]], and [[anti-Christian movement|anti-Christian]] uprising that took place in [[China]] between 1899 and 1901, toward the end of the [[Qing dynasty]]. They were motivated by proto-[[Chinese nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments and by opposition to [[Western world|Western]] [[colonialism]] and the [[Protestant missions in China|Christian missionary activity]] that was associated with it.

It was initiated by the [[Yìhéquán|Militia United in Righteousness]] (''[[Yìhéquán|Yihetuan]]''), known in English as the ''Boxers'', for many of their members had been practitioners of [[Chinese martial arts]], also referred to in the west as ''Chinese Boxing''. The uprising took place against a background that included severe drought and disruption caused by the growth of foreign [[spheres of influence]]. After several months of growing violence in [[Shandong]] and the [[North China plain]] against the foreign and [[Christian]] presence in June 1900, Boxer fighters, convinced they were invulnerable to foreign weapons, converged on [[Beijing]] with the slogan ''Support the Qing government and exterminate the foreigners''. Foreigners and Chinese Christians sought refuge in the [[Beijing Legation Quarter|Legation Quarter]].

In response to reports of an armed invasion by allied American, Austro-Hungarian, British, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Russian forces to lift the siege, the initially hesitant [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] supported the Boxers and on June{{nbsp}}21 issued an [[Imperial Decree of declaration of war against foreign powers|Imperial Decree]] [[Declaration of war|declaring war]] on the foreign powers. Diplomats, foreign civilians, and soldiers as well as [[Christianity in China|Chinese Christians]] in the Legation Quarter were detained for 55 days by the Imperial Army of China and the Boxers.

Chinese officialdom was split between those supporting the Boxers and those favoring conciliation, led by [[Yikuang, Prince Qing|Prince Qing]]. The supreme commander of the Chinese forces, the Manchu General [[Ronglu]] (Junglu), later claimed he acted to protect the besieged foreigners. Many officials refused the imperial order to fight against foreigners in their [[Mutual Protection of Southeast China]], because Qing had lost the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] five years before.

The [[Eight-Nation Alliance]], after being initially turned back, brought 20,000 armed troops to China, defeated the Imperial Army, and arrived at Peking on August{{nbsp}}14, relieving the [[Siege of the International Legations|siege of the Legations]]. Uncontrolled plunder of the capital and the surrounding countryside ensued, along with the [[summary execution]] of those suspected of being Boxers.

The [[Boxer Protocol]] of 7 September 1901 provided for the [[Capital punishment|execution]] of government officials who had supported the Boxers, provisions for foreign troops to be stationed in Beijing, and 450&amp;nbsp;million [[tael]]s of [[silver]]—approximately $10&amp;nbsp;billion at 2018 silver prices and more than the government's annual [[tax revenue]]—to be paid as [[indemnity]] over the course of the next thirty-nine years to the eight nations involved. The Empress Dowager then sponsored a set of [[New Policies|institutional and fiscal changes]] in a [[Xinhai Revolution|failed attempt]] to save the dynasty.

==Historical background==

===Origins of the Boxers===
[[File:BoxerRevolutionarybyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wax sculpture|Model made out of wax]] of a Boxer, armed with a spear and sword.&lt;br&gt;Model by George S. Stuart]]
[[File:Boxer Rebellion.png|thumb|upright-1.2|Boxer Rebellion and Eight-Nation Alliance, China 1900-1901]]

The Righteous and Harmonious Fists (Yihequan) arose in the inland sections of the northern coastal province of [[Shandong]], long known for social unrest, religious sects, and martial societies. American Christian missionaries were probably the first to refer to the well-trained, athletic young men as "Boxers", because of the martial arts and weapons training they practiced. Their primary practice was a type of [[Chinese spirit possession|spiritual possession]] which involved the whirling of swords, violent prostrations, and chanting incantations to deities.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Larry Clinton (2009), ''William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary'', Jefferson, NC: McFarland and Co., Inc., p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The opportunities to fight back Western encroachment and colonization were especially attractive to unemployed village men, many of whom were teenagers.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jVESdBSMasMC&amp;pg=PA114 114]}} The tradition of possession and invulnerability went back several hundred years but took on special meaning against the powerful new weapons of the West.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987| pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jVESdBSMasMC&amp;pg=PA54 xii, 54- 59, 96, etc.]}}  The Boxers, armed with rifles and swords, claimed supernatural invulnerability towards blows of cannon, rifle shots, and knife attacks. Furthermore, the Boxer groups popularly claimed that millions of soldiers of [[Tian|Heaven]] would descend to assist them in purifying China of foreign oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAxresT12ogC&amp;pg=PA112|title=The origins of the Boxer War: a multinational study|author=Lanxin Xiang|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|page=114|isbn=0-7007-1563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These beliefs are characteristic of [[millenarianism|millenarian]] movements of [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] resistance, especially the characteristic magical belief, shared by the [[Ghost Dance]]rs of North America and the Kartelite Cults of Africa, that the believer could be rendered invulnerable to bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Landes|first=Richard|editor=James R Lewis|title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRESDAAAQBAJ|date=17 July 2008|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0-19-536964-9|chapter=Millennialism|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=sRESDAAAQBAJ 342]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, in spite of ambivalence toward their heterodox practices, [[Yuxian (Qing dynasty)|Yuxian]], a Manchu who was then prefect of [[Cao Prefecture|Caozhou]] and would later become provincial governor, used the [[Big Swords Society]] in fighting bandits. The Big Swords, emboldened by this official support, also attacked their local Catholic village rivals, who turned to the Church for protection. The Big Swords responded by attacking Catholic churches and [[Church arson|burning]] them. "The line between Christians and bandits", remarks one recent historian, "became increasingly indistinct." As a result of diplomatic pressure in the capital, Yuxian executed several Big Sword leaders, but did not punish anyone else. More martial secret societies started emerging after this.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997| p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ky4_whmgIZcC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}}

The early years saw a variety of village activities, not a broad movement with a united purpose. Martial folk religious societies such as the [[Baguadao]] (Eight Trigrams) prepared the way for the Boxers. Like the Red Boxing school or the [[Plum Flower tradition|Plum Flower Boxers]], the Boxers of Shandong were more concerned with traditional social and moral values, such as filial piety, than with foreign influences. One leader, Zhu Hongdeng (Red Lantern Zhu), started as a wandering healer, specializing in skin ulcers, and gained wide respect by refusing payment for his treatments.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ky4_whmgIZcC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30 27–30]}} Zhu claimed descent from [[Ming dynasty]] emperors, since his surname was the surname of the Ming imperial family.

European legations had a particular jurisdiction status in Peking: they were not subject to Chinese authorities. A den of robbers had been formed in the out-buildings of the German legation, mainly among Lutheran missionaries. They were doing pillage in the city as much as they could, then took shelter in the European legations to escape any punishment for their criminal acts, hence triggering exasperation among the townspeople. The German minister, in an attempt to stop the rising counter-movement, set himself to harrangue the mob, but he only succeeded to get himself killed in the turmoil. To avenge this outrage, a retaliation expedition was organized at once, involving most European states in the wake of Germany.

The combination of extreme weather conditions, Western attempts at colonizing China and growing anti-imperialist sentiment fueled the movement. First, a drought followed by floods in Shandong province in 1897–1898 forced farmers to flee to cities and seek food. As one observer said, "I am convinced that a few days' heavy rainfall to terminate the long-continued drought ... would do more to restore tranquility than any measures which either the Chinese government or foreign governments can take."{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=9}}

A major cause of discontent in north China was missionary activity. The [[Treaty of Tientsin]] (or Tianjin) and the [[Convention of Peking]], signed in 1860 after the [[Second Opium War]], had granted foreign missionaries the freedom to preach anywhere in China and to buy land on which to build churches.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=77}} On 1 November 1897, a band of armed men who were perhaps members of the [[Big Swords Society]] stormed the residence of a German missionary from the [[Society of the Divine Word]] and killed two priests. This attack is known as the [[Juye Incident]].

When [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] received news of these murders, he dispatched the [[German East Asia Squadron]] to occupy [[Jiaozhou Bay]] on the southern coast of the Shandong peninsula. {{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jVESdBSMasMC&amp;pg=PA363 123]}} Germany's action triggered a "scramble for [[concession (territory)|concessions]]" by which Britain, France, Russia and Japan also secured their own [[sphere of influence]] in China.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=129–30}}

In October 1898, a group of Boxers attacked the Christian community of Liyuantun village where a temple to the [[Jade Emperor]] had been converted into a Catholic church. Disputes had surrounded the church since 1869, when the temple had been granted to the Christian residents of the village. This incident marked the first time the Boxers used the slogan "Support the Qing, destroy the foreigners" ("扶清灭洋 ''fu Qing mie yang''") that would later characterise them.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=143–144, 163}} The "Boxers" called themselves the "Militia United in Righteousness" for the first time one year later, at the [[Battle of Senluo Temple]] (October 1899), a clash between Boxers and Qing government troops.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=253}} By using the word "Militia" rather than "Boxers", they distanced themselves from forbidden martial arts sects, and tried to give their movement the legitimacy of a group that defended orthodoxy.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=32}}

Aggression toward missionaries and Christians drew the ire of foreign (mainly European) governments.&lt;ref&gt;Spence (1999) pp. 231–232.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, the French minister in Beijing helped the missionaries to obtain an edict granting official status to every order in the Roman Catholic hierarchy, enabling local priests to support their people in legal or family disputes and bypass the local officials. After the German government took over Shandong many Chinese feared that the foreign missionaries and quite possibly all Christian activities were imperialist attempts at "carving the melon", i.e., to divide and colonize China piece by piece.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|loc=Ch 3 "Imperialism for Christ's Sake", pp. 68–95}} A Chinese official expressed the animosity towards foreigners succinctly, "Take away your missionaries and your opium and you will be welcome."{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=12}}

The early growth of the Boxer movement coincided with the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] (11 June – 21 September 1898). Progressive Chinese officials, with support from Protestant missionaries, persuaded the [[Guangxu Emperor]] to institute reforms which alienated many conservative officials by their sweeping nature. Such opposition from conservative officials led [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] to intervene and reverse the reforms. The failure of the reform movement disillusioned many educated Chinese and thus further weakened the Qing government. After the reforms ended, the conservative Empress Dowager Cixi seized power and placed the reformist Guangxu Emperor under house arrest.

The national crisis was widely seen as being caused by foreign aggression.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p=114}} Foreign powers had defeated China in several wars, forced a right to promote Christianity and imposed [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] under which foreigners and foreign companies in China were accorded special privileges, extraterritorial rights and immunities from Chinese law, causing resentment among the Chinese. France, Japan, Russia and Germany carved out spheres of influence, so that by 1900 it appeared that China would likely be dismembered, with foreign powers each ruling a part of the country. Thus, by 1900, the Qing dynasty, which had ruled China for more than two centuries, was crumbling and Chinese culture was under assault by powerful and unfamiliar religions and secular cultures.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=7–8}}

In January 1900, with a majority of conservatives in the imperial court, Empress Dowager Cixi changed her position on the Boxers, and issued edicts in their defence, causing protests from foreign powers. In spring 1900, the Boxer movement spread rapidly north from Shandong into the countryside near Beijing. Boxers burned Christian churches, killed Chinese Christians and intimidated Chinese officials who stood in their way. American Minister [[Edwin H. Conger]] cabled Washington, "the whole country is swarming with hungry, discontented, hopeless idlers." On 30 May the diplomats, led by British Minister [[Claude Maxwell MacDonald]], requested that foreign soldiers come to Beijing to defend the legations. The Chinese government reluctantly acquiesced, and the next day a multinational force of 435 navy troops from eight countries disembarked from warships and travelled by train from [[Taku Forts|Dagu (Taku)]] to Beijing. They set up defensive perimeters around their respective missions.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 42 }}

On 5 June 1900, the railway line to Tianjin was cut by Boxers in the countryside and Beijing was isolated. On 11 June, at [[Yongdingmen|Yongding gate]], the secretary of the Japanese legation, Sugiyama Akira, was [[Kansu Braves#Assassination of Sugiyama Akira|attacked and killed by the soldiers]] of general [[Dong Fuxiang]], who were guarding the southern part of the Beijing walled city.{{sfnb|Preston|2000|p =70}} Armed with [[Mauser]] rifles but wearing traditional uniforms,{{sfnb|Elliott| 2002|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=wWvl9O4Gn1UC 126]}} Dong's troops had threatened the foreign Legations in the fall of 1898 soon after arriving in Beijing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAxresT12ogC|title=The origins of the Boxer War: a multinational study|author=Lanxin Xiang|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|page=207|isbn=0-7007-1563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; so much that troops from the [[United States Marine Corps]] had been called to Beijing to guard the legations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=S8YtE0SIDq0C&amp;pg=PA25 |title=The United States Marines in North China, 1894–1942 |author=Chester M.

===Seymour Expedition===
{{main|Seymour Expedition}}
[[File:BoxerJapaneseMarines.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese marines who served in the [[Seymour Expedition]]]]

As the situation grew more violent, a second multinational force of 2,000 sailors and marines under the command of the British Vice-Admiral [[Edward Hobart Seymour|Edward Seymour]], the largest contingent being British, was dispatched from Dagu to Beijing on 10 June 1900. The troops were transported by train from Dagu to Tianjin with the agreement of the Chinese government, but the railway between Tianjin and Beijing had been severed. Seymour resolved to move forward and repair the railway, or progress on foot if necessary, keeping in mind that the distance between Tianjin and Beijing was only 120&amp;nbsp;km. When Seymour left Tianjin and started toward Beijing, it angered the imperial court.

As a result, the pro-Boxer Manchu Prince Duan became leader of the Zongli Yamen (foreign office), replacing Prince Qing. Prince Duan was a member of the imperial [[Aisin Gioro]] clan (foreigners called him a "Blood Royal"), and Empress Dowager Cixi had named her son as next in line for the [[Dragon Throne|imperial throne]]. He became the effective leader of the Boxers, and was extremely anti-foreigner. He soon ordered the Qing imperial army to attack the foreign forces. Confused by conflicting orders from Beijing, General [[Nie Shicheng]] let Seymour's army pass by in their trains.{{sfn|Leonhard|p=12}}

[[File:SeymourTianjin.jpg|thumb|Admiral Seymour returning to Tianjin with his wounded men on 26 June]]

After leaving Tianjin, the convoy quickly reached Langfang, but found the railway there to be destroyed. Seymour's engineers tried to repair the line, but the allied army found itself surrounded, as the railway both behind and in front of them had been destroyed. They were attacked from all parts by Chinese irregulars and Chinese governmental troops. Five thousand of Dong Fuxiang's "[[Kansu Braves|Gansu Braves]]" and an unknown number of "Boxers" won a costly but major victory over Seymour's troops at the [[Battle of Langfang]] on 18 June.{{sfn|Leonhard|p=18}}{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=ky4_whmgIZcC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49 49]}} As the allied European army retreated from Langfang, they were constantly fired upon by cavalry, and artillery bombarded their positions. It was reported that the Chinese artillery was superior to the European artillery, since the Europeans did not bother to bring along much for the campaign, thinking they could easily sweep through Chinese resistance.

The Europeans could not locate the Chinese artillery, which was raining shells upon their positions.&lt;ref name="smith1901"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WmAuAAAAYAAJ |title=China in convulsion |volume=2 |first=Arthur Henderson |last=Smith |year=1901 |publisher=F.

[[File:Italian mounted infantry in China 1900 HD-SN-99-01989.jpg|thumb|left|Italian mounted infantry near [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] in 1900]]

News arrived on 18 June regarding attacks on foreign legations. Seymour decided to continue advancing, this time along the Beihe river, toward [[Tongzhou, Hebei|Tongzhou]], {{convert|25|km}} from Beijing. By the 19th, they had to abandon their efforts due to progressively stiffening resistance and started to retreat southward along the river with over 200 wounded. Commandeering four civilian Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]] along the river, they loaded all their wounded and remaining supplies onto them and pulled them along with ropes from the riverbanks. By this point they were very low on food, ammunition and medical supplies. Unexpectedly they then happened upon [[The Great Hsi-Ku Arsenal|the Great Xigu Arsenal]], a hidden Qing munitions cache of which the Allied Powers had had no knowledge until then. They immediately captured and occupied it, discovering not only [[Krupp]] field guns, but rifles with millions of rounds of ammunition, along with millions of pounds of rice and ample medical supplies.

There they dug in and awaited rescue. A Chinese servant was able to infiltrate through the Boxer and Qing lines, informing the Eight Powers of the Seymour troops' predicament. Surrounded and attacked nearly around the clock by Qing troops and Boxers, they were at the point of being overrun. On 25 June, a regiment composed of 1,800 men (900 Russian troops from [[Lüshunkou|Port Arthur]], 500 British seamen, with an ad hoc mix of other assorted Alliance troops) finally arrived on foot from Tientsin to rescue Seymour. Spiking the mounted field guns and setting fire to any munitions that they could not take (an estimated £3&amp;nbsp;million worth), Seymour, his force, and the rescue mission marched back to Tientsin, unopposed, on 26 June. Seymour's casualties during the expedition were 62 killed and 228 wounded.{{sfnb|Preston|2000|p = 100-104}}

===Conflicting attitudes within the Qing imperial court===
[[File:Qing Imperial Army.jpg|thumb|Qing imperial soldiers during the Boxer Rebellion]]

Meanwhile, in Beijing, on 16 June, Empress Dowager Cixi summoned the imperial court for a mass audience and addressed the choices between using the Boxers to evict the foreigners from the city or seeking a diplomatic solution. In response to a high official who doubted the efficacy of the Boxers' magic, Cixi replied: Both sides of the debate at the imperial court realised that popular support for the Boxers in the countryside was almost universal and that suppression would be both difficult and unpopular, especially when foreign troops were on the march.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jVESdBSMasMC&amp;lpg=PA289 289–290]}}&lt;ref name="Purcell2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor Purcell|title=The Boxer Uprising: A Background Study|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2MeUoD9G9xAC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;q=cannot%20rely%20charms%20heart%20people%20lose|date=3 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-14812-2|pages=250–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two factions were active during this debate. On one side were anti-foreigners who viewed foreigners as invasive and imperialistic and evoked a nativist populism. They advocated taking advantage of the Boxers to achieve the expulsion of foreign troops and foreign influences. The pro-foreigners on the other hand advanced rapprochement with foreign governments, seeing the Boxers as superstitious and ignorant.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The event that tilted the Qing imperial government irrevocably toward support of the Boxers and war with the foreign powers was the attack of foreign navies on the [[Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)|Dagu Forts]] near Tianjin, on 17 June 1900.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Siege of the Beijing legations===
{{main|Siege of the International Legations}}

On 15 June, Qing imperial forces deployed electric [[Naval mine|mines]] in the [[Beihe River|River Beihe]] (Peiho) to prevent the Eight-Nation Alliance from sending ships to attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LYYLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA533|title=Reports on Military Operations in South Africa and China|authors=Stephan L'H.

With a difficult military situation in Tianjin and a total breakdown of communications between Tianjin and Beijing, the allied nations took steps to reinforce their military presence significantly. On 17 June they took the Dagu Forts commanding the approaches to Tianjin, and from there brought increasing numbers of troops on shore. When Cixi received an ultimatum{{when|date=February 2014}} demanding that China surrender total control over all its military and financial affairs to foreigners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Last Empress: The She-Dragon of China|author=Keith Laidler|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=221|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLPZ7294oSIC&amp;pg=PA221|isbn=0-470-86426-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; she defiantly stated before the entire [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]], "Now they [the Powers] have started the aggression, and the extinction of our nation is imminent.

It was at this point that Cixi began to blockade the legations with the armies of the [[Peking Field Force]], which began the siege. Cixi stated that "I have always been of the opinion, that the allied armies had been permitted to escape too easily [[Second Opium War|in 1860]]. Only a united effort was then necessary to have given China the victory. Today, at last, the opportunity for revenge has come", and said that millions of Chinese would join the cause of fighting the foreigners since the Manchus had provided "great benefits" on China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit Soldiers: A Historical Narrative of the Boxer Rebellion|author=Richard O'Connor| year=1973|edition=illustrated| publisher=Putnam|page=85| url=https://books.google.com/?id=P4NxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=extinction+imminent}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On receipt of the news of the attack on the [[Dagu Fort]]s on the 19th of June, Empress Dowager Cixi immediately sent an order to the legations that the diplomats and other foreigners depart Beijing under escort of the Chinese army within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning, diplomats from the besieged legations met to discuss the Empress's offer. The majority quickly agreed that they could not trust the Chinese army. Fearing that they would be killed, they agreed to refuse the Empress's demand. The German Imperial Envoy, Baron Klemens Freiherr von Ketteler, was infuriated with the actions of the Chinese army troops and determined to take his complaints to the royal court. Against the advice of the fellow foreigners, the baron left the legations with a single aide and a team of porters to carry his sedan chair. On his way to the palace, von Ketteler was killed on the streets of Beijing by a Manchu captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Warriors of the Rising Sun: A History of the Japanese Military|author=Robert B.

At this news, the other diplomats feared they also would be murdered if they left the legation quarter and they chose to continue to defy the Chinese order to depart Beijing. The legations were hurriedly fortified. Most of the foreign civilians, which included a large number of missionaries and businessmen, took refuge in the British legation, the largest of the diplomatic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Preston, page 87, "A Brief History of the Boxer Rebellion", {{ISBN|1-84119-490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Christians were primarily housed in the adjacent palace (Fu) of Prince Su who was forced to abandon his property by the foreign soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Preston, page 79, "A Brief History of the Boxer Rebellion", {{ISBN|1-84119-490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legations of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United States, Russia and Japan were located in the [[Beijing Legation Quarter]] south of the [[Forbidden City]]. The Chinese army and Boxer irregulars besieged the Legation Quarter from 20 June to 14 August 1900. A total of 473 foreign civilians, 409 soldiers, marines and sailors from eight countries, and about 3,000 Chinese Christians took refuge there.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=84–85}} Under the command of the British minister to China, [[Claude Maxwell MacDonald]], the legation staff and military guards defended the compound with small arms, three machine guns, and one old muzzle-loaded cannon, which was nicknamed the ''International Gun'' because the barrel was British, the carriage Italian, the shells Russian and the crew American. Chinese Christians in the legations led the foreigners to the cannon and it proved important in the defence. Also under siege in Beijing was the [[Church of the Saviour, Beijing|Northern Cathedral]] (''Beitang'') of the Catholic Church. The Beitang was defended by 43 French and Italian soldiers, 33 Catholic foreign priests and nuns, and about 3,200 Chinese Catholics. The defenders suffered heavy casualties especially from lack of food and mines which the Chinese exploded in tunnels dug beneath the compound.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=85, 170–171}} The number of Chinese soldiers and Boxers besieging the Legation Quarter and the Beitang is unknown.

On the 22nd and 23 June, Chinese soldiers and Boxers set fire to areas north and west of the British Legation, using it as a "frightening tactic" to attack the defenders. The nearby [[Hanlin Academy]], a complex of courtyards and buildings that housed "the quintessence of Chinese scholarship ... the oldest and richest library in the world", caught fire. Each side blamed the other for the destruction of the invaluable books it contained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla62/62-davd.htm|title=Destruction of Chinese Books in the Peking Siege of 1900.

After the failure to burn out the foreigners, the Chinese army adopted an anaconda-like strategy. The Chinese built barricades surrounding the Legation Quarter and advanced, brick by brick, on the foreign lines, forcing the foreign legation guards to retreat a few feet at a time. This tactic was especially used in the Fu, defended by Japanese and Italian sailors and soldiers, and inhabited by most of the Chinese Christians. Fusillades of bullets, artillery and firecrackers were directed against the Legations almost every night—but did little damage. Sniper fire took its toll among the foreign defenders. Despite their numerical advantage, the Chinese did not attempt a direct assault on the Legation Quarter although in the words of one of the besieged, "it would have been easy by a strong, swift movement on the part of the numerous Chinese troops to have annihilated the whole body of foreigners ... in an hour."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Arthur H. ''China in Convulsion''. 2 vols. New York: Fleming H. Revell, 1901, pp. 316–317&lt;/ref&gt; American missionary [[Francis Dunlap Gamewell|Frank Gamewell]] and his crew of "fighting parsons" fortified the Legation Quarter,&lt;ref&gt;Weale, Putnam. ''Indiscreet Letters from Peking.'' New York: Dodd, Mead, 1907, pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt; but impressed Chinese Christians to do most of the physical labour of building defences.&lt;ref&gt;Payen, Cecile E. "Besieged in Peking." ''The Century Magazine'', January 1901, pp 458–460&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans and the Americans occupied perhaps the most crucial of all defensive positions: the Tartar Wall. Holding the top of the {{convert |45|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert |40|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide wall was vital. The German barricades faced east on top of the wall and {{convert |400|yd|m|abbr=on}} west were the west-facing American positions. The Chinese advanced toward both positions by building barricades even closer. "The men all feel they are in a trap", said the American commander, Capt. [[John Twiggs Myers|John T. Myers]], "and simply await the hour of execution."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Captain John T. "Military Operations and Defenses of the Siege of Peking." ''Proceedings of the U.S. Naval Institute'', September 1902, pp. 542–50.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June, the Chinese forced the Germans off the Wall, leaving the American Marines alone in its defence. At the same time, a Chinese barricade was advanced to within a few feet of the American positions and it became clear that the Americans had to abandon the wall or force the Chinese to retreat. At 2&amp;nbsp;am on 3 July, 56 British, Russian and American marines and sailors, under the command of Myers, launched an assault against the Chinese barricade on the wall. The attack caught the Chinese sleeping, killed about 20 of them, and expelled the rest of them from the barricades.&lt;ref&gt;Oliphant, Nigel, ''A Diary of the Siege of the Legations in Peking''. London: Longman, Greens, 1901, pp 78–80&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese did not attempt to advance their positions on the Tartar Wall for the remainder of the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, W.A.P. ''The Siege in Peking''. New York:Fleming H. Revell, 1900, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Claude MacDonald said 13 July was the "most harassing day" of the siege.{{sfnb|Fleming|1959|p=157–158}} The Japanese and Italians in the Fu were driven back to their last defence line. The Chinese detonated a mine beneath the French Legation pushing the French and Austrians out of most of the French Legation.{{sfnb|Fleming|1959|p=157–158}} On 16 July, the most capable British officer was killed and the journalist [[George Ernest Morrison]] was wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Peter and Macklin, Robert ''The Man who Died Twice: The Life and Adventures of Morrison of Peking''. Crow's Nest, Australia: Allen &amp; Unwin, 2005, pp 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; But American Minister [[Edwin Hurd Conger]] established contact with the Chinese government and on 17 July, an armistice was declared by the Chinese.{{sfnb|Conger|1909|p= 135}} More than 40% of the legation guards were dead or wounded. The motivation of the Chinese was probably the realization that an allied force of 20,000 men had landed in China and retribution for the siege was at hand.

===Officials and commanders at cross purposes===
[[File:General Nie Shicheng.jpg|thumb|upright|Han Chinese General [[Nie Shicheng]], who fought both the Boxers and the Allies{{sfnb|Elliott|2002| p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=wWvl9O4Gn1UC 402] }}]]

The Manchu General [[Ronglu]] concluded that it was futile to fight all of the powers simultaneously, and declined to press home the siege.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997| p= 54}} The Manchu [[Zaiyi]] (Prince Duan), an anti-foreign friend of [[Dong Fuxiang]], wanted artillery for Dong's troops to destroy the legations. Ronglu blocked the transfer of artillery to Zaiyi and Dong, preventing them from attacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GiqiIYdocKMC&amp;pg=PA216|title=Empress dowager Cixi: China's last dynasty and the long reign of a formidable concubine: legends and lives during the declining days of the Qing dynasty|author=X.

They issued edicts ordering the foreigners to be protected, but the Gansu warriors ignored it, and fought against Bannermen who tried to force them away from the legations. The Boxers also took commands from Dong Fuxiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Md801mHEeOkC&amp;pg=PA124 |title=Modern Chinese warfare, 1795–1989 |author=Bruce A.

The Decree ordered him to stop fighting the Boxers because of the foreign invasion, and also because the population was suffering. Due to Ronglu's actions, General Nie continued to fight the Boxers and killed many of them even as the foreign troops were making their way into China. Ronglu also ordered Nie to protect foreigners and save the railway from the Boxers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lAxresT12ogC&amp;pg=PA235|title=The origins of the Boxer War: a multinational study|author=Lanxin Xiang|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|page=235|isbn=0-7007-1563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because parts of the Railway were saved under Ronglu's orders, the foreign invasion army was able to transport itself into China quickly. General Nie committed thousands of troops against the Boxers instead of against the foreigners. Nie was already outnumbered by the Allies by 4,000 men. General Nie was blamed for attacking the Boxers, as Ronglu let Nie take all the blame. At the [[Battle of Tientsin|Battle of Tianjin (Tientsin)]], General Nie decided to sacrifice his life by walking into the range of Allied guns.{{sfnb|Elliott|2002|p = 499}}

[[File:BoxerSoldiers.jpg|thumb|left|Boxer rebels]]

[[Xu Jingcheng]], who had served as the Qing Envoy to many of the same states under siege in the Legation Quarter, argued that "the evasion of extraterritorial rights and the killing of foreign diplomats are unprecedented in China and abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=趙爾巽等撰 |year=1976 |title=Qing shi gao |last3=Zhao |first3=Erxun |author2=趙爾巽 |publisher=新華書店北京發行所發行,&lt;/span&gt; Beijing |oclc=17045858| ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xu and five other officials urged Empress Dowager Cixi to order the repression of Boxers, the execution of their leaders, and a diplomatic settlement with foreign armies. The Empress Dowager, outraged, sentenced Xu and the five others to death for "willfully and absurdly petitioning the Imperial Court" and "building subversive thought." They were executed on July 28, 1900 and their severed heads placed on display at [[Caishikou Execution Grounds]] in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.ihp.sinica.edu.tw/ttscgi/ttsquery?0:0:mctauac:TM%3D%B3%5C%B4%BA%BC%E1|title=資料連結|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dong Fuxiang.jpg|thumb|upright|Han Chinese General [[Dong Fuxiang]] was overtly hostile to foreigners and his "Gansu Braves" relentlessly attacked the besieged legations.]]

Reflecting this vacillation, some Chinese soldiers were quite liberally firing at foreigners under siege from its very onset. Cixi did not personally order imperial troops to conduct a siege, and on the contrary had ordered them to protect the foreigners in the legations. Prince Duan led the Boxers to loot his enemies within the imperial court and the foreigners, although imperial authorities expelled Boxers after they were let into the city and went on a looting rampage against both the foreign and the Qing imperial forces. Older Boxers were sent outside Beijing to halt the approaching foreign armies, while younger men were absorbed into the Muslim Gansu army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNPFc7kkjwAC&amp;pg=PA88|title=Imperial masquerade: the legend of Princess Der Ling|author=Grant Hayter-Menzies |year=2008|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|page=88|isbn=962-209-881-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With conflicting allegiances and priorities motivating the various forces inside Beijing, the situation in the city became increasingly confused. The foreign legations continued to be surrounded by both Qing imperial and Gansu forces. While Dong Fuxiang's Gansu army, now swollen by the addition of the Boxers, wished to press the siege, Ronglu's imperial forces seem to have largely attempted to follow Empress Dowager Cixi's decree and protect the legations. However, to satisfy the conservatives in the imperial court, Ronglu's men also fired on the legations and let off firecrackers to give the impression that they, too, were attacking the foreigners. Inside the legations and out of communication with the outside world, the foreigners simply fired on any targets that presented themselves, including messengers from the imperial court, civilians and besiegers of all persuasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNPFc7kkjwAC&amp;pg=PA88|title=Imperial masquerade: the legend of Princess Der Ling|author1=Grant Hayter-Menzies |year=2008|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|page=89|isbn=962-209-881-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dong Fuxiang was denied artillery held by Ronglu which stopped him from leveling the legations, and when he complained to Empress Dowager Cixi on June 23, she dismissively said that "Your tail, is becoming too heavy to wag." The Alliance discovered large amounts of unused Chinese Krupp artillery and shells after the siege was lifted.{{sfnb|Fleming|1959|p = 226}}

The armistice, although occasionally broken, endured until 13 August when, with an allied army led by the British [[Alfred Gaselee]] approaching Beijing to relieve the siege, the Chinese launched their heaviest fusillade on the Legation Quarter. As the foreign army approached, Chinese forces melted away.

===Gaselee Expedition===
{{Boxer Rebellion}}
{{main|Eight-Nation Alliance|Gaselee Expedition}}

Foreign navies started building up their presence along the northern China coast from the end of April 1900. Several international forces were sent to the capital, with varying success, and the Chinese forces were ultimately defeated by the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] of [[Austria-Hungary]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], [[Imperial Japan|Japan]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Independent of the alliance, the [[Netherlands]] dispatched three cruisers in July to protect its citizens in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor-last = Nordholt| editor-first = J. W.

British Lieutenant-General [[Alfred Gaselee]] acted as the commanding officer of the Eight-Nation Alliance, which eventually numbered 55,000. The main contingent was composed of Japanese (20,840), Russian (13,150), British (12,020), French (3,520), U.S. (3,420), German (900), Italian (80), Austro-Hungarian (75) and anti-Boxer Chinese troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russojapanesewar.com/boxers.html |title=Russojapanesewarweb |publisher=Russojapanesewar.com |date=1 July 1902 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "First Chinese Regiment" ([[Weihaiwei Regiment]]) which was praised for its performance, consisted of Chinese collaborators serving in the British military.&lt;ref name="Powell2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph L.

Notable events included the seizure of the [[Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)|Dagu Forts]] commanding the approaches to Tianjin and the boarding and capture of four Chinese destroyers by British Commander [[Roger John Brownlow Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Roger Keyes]]. Among the foreigners besieged in Tianjin was a young American mining engineer named [[Herbert Hoover]], who would go on to become the 31st President of the United States.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=96}}&lt;ref name=Hoover&gt;Hoover, Herbert C.

[[File:CaptureTianjin.jpg|thumb|The capture of the southern gate of Tianjin. British troops were positioned on the left, Japanese troops at the centre, French troops on the right.]]

The march from Tianjin to Beijing of about 120&amp;nbsp;km included about 20,000 allied troops. On 4 August, there were approximately 70,000 Qing imperial troops and anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 Boxers along the way. The allies only encountered minor resistance, fighting battles at [[Battle of Beicang|Beicang]] and [[Battle of Yangcun|Yangcun]]. At Yangcun, the [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|14th Infantry Regiment]] of the U.S. and British troops led the assault. The weather was a major obstacle. Conditions were extremely humid with temperatures sometimes reaching {{convert|42|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. These high temperatures and insects plagued the Allies. Soldiers dehydrated and horses died. Chinese villagers killed Allied troops who searched for wells.{{sfnb|Edgerton|1997|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=wkHyjjbv-yEC 88]}}

The heat killed Allied soldiers, who foamed at the mouth. The tactics along the way were gruesome on either side. Allied soldiers beheaded already dead Chinese corpses, bayoneted or beheaded live Chinese civilians, and raped Chinese girls and women.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5K9BN96p1hcC&amp;pg=PA168 168]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cossacks were reported to have killed Chinese civilians almost automatically and Japanese kicked a Chinese soldier to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edgerton|1997|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wkHyjjbv-yEC&amp;pg=PA89 87, 89]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese responded to the Alliance's atrocities with similar acts of violence and cruelty, especially towards captured Russians.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Lieutenant [[Smedley Butler]] saw the remains of two Japanese soldiers nailed to a wall, who had their tongues cut off and their eyes gouged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edgerton|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wkHyjjbv-yEC&amp;pg=PA88 88]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Butler was wounded during the expedition in the leg and chest, later receiving the Brevet Medal in recognition for his actions.

[[File:Chinese Soldiers 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese troops wearing modern uniforms in 1900]]

The international force reached Beijing on 14 August. Following the defeat of Beiyang army in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the Chinese government had invested heavily in modernizing the imperial army, which was equipped with modern [[Mauser]] repeater rifles and [[Krupp]] artillery. Three modernized divisions consisting of Manchu [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] protected the Beijing Metropolitan region. Two of them were under the command of the anti-Boxer [[Yikuang, Prince Qing|Prince Qing]] and Ronglu, while the anti-foreign Prince Duan commanded the ten-thousand-strong [[Hushenying]], or "Tiger Spirit Division", which had joined the Gansu Braves and Boxers in attacking the foreigners. It was a Hushenying captain who had assassinated the German diplomat Ketteler. The Tenacious Army under Nie Shicheng received western style training under German and Russian officers in addition to their modernised weapons and uniforms. They effectively resisted the Alliance at the [[Battle of Tientsin]] before retreating and astounded the Alliance forces with the accuracy of their artillery during the siege of the Tianjin concessions (the artillery shells failed to explode upon impact due to corrupt manufacturing). The Gansu Braves under Dong Fuxiang, which some sources described as "ill disciplined", were armed with modern weapons but were not trained according to western drill and wore traditional Chinese uniforms. They led the defeat of the Alliance at Langfang in the Seymour Expedition and were the most ferocious in besieging the Legations in Beijing. Some [[Eight Banner|Banner]] forces were given modernised weapons and western training, becoming the Metropolitan Banner forces, which were decimated in the fighting. Among the Manchu dead was the father of the writer [[Lao She]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The British won the race among the international forces to be the first to reach the besieged Legation Quarter. The U.S. was able to play a role due to the presence of U.S. ships and troops stationed in [[Manila]] since the U.S. conquest of the Philippines during the [[Spanish–American War]] and the subsequent [[Philippine–American War]]. In the U.S. military, the action in the Boxer Rebellion was known as the [[China Relief Expedition]]. [[United States Marines]] scaling the walls of Beijing is an iconic image of the Boxer Rebellion.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=177}}

The British Army reached the legation quarter on the afternoon of 14 August and relieved the Legation Quarter. The Beitang was relieved on 16 August, first by Japanese soldiers and then, officially, by the French.{{sfnb|Fleming|1959|p=220–221}}

===Evacuation of the Qing imperial court from Beijing to Xi'an===
[[File:BoxerTroops.jpg|thumb|Painting of Western and Japanese troops]]

In the early hours of 15 August, just as the Foreign Legations were being relieved, Empress Dowager Cixi, dressed in the padded blue cotton of a farm woman, the Guangxu Emperor, and a small retinue climbed into three wooden ox carts and escaped from the city covered with rough blankets. Legend has it that the Empress Dowager then either ordered that the Guangxu Emperor's favourite concubine, [[Consort Zhen]], be thrown down a well in the Forbidden City or tricked her into drowning herself. The journey was made all the more arduous by the lack of preparation, but the Empress Dowager insisted this was not a retreat, rather a "tour of inspection." After weeks of travel, the party arrived in [[Xi'an]] in [[Shaanxi]] province, beyond protective mountain passes where the foreigners could not reach, deep in Chinese Muslim territory and protected by the Gansu Braves. The foreigners had no orders to pursue the Empress Dowager, so they decided to stay put.{{sfnb|Preston|2000|pp=253–261}}

==Russian invasion of Manchuria==
[[File:Russian soldiers during the boxer rebellion.jpg|left|thumb|Russian officers in Manchuria during the Boxer Rebellion]]

The Russian Empire and the Qing Empire had maintained a long peace, starting with the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] in 1689, but Tsarist forces took advantage of Chinese defeats to impose the [[Aigun Treaty]] of 1858 and the [[Treaty of Peking]] of 1860 which ceded formerly Chinese territory in Manchuria to Russia, much of which is held by Russia to the present day ([[Primorye]]). The Russians aimed for control over the [[Amur River]] for navigation, and the all-weather ports of [[Dairen]] and [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]] in the [[Liaodong]] peninsula. The rise of Japan as an Asian power provoked Russia's anxiety, especially in light of expanding Japanese influence in [[Korea]]. Following Japan's victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1895, the [[Triple Intervention]] of Russia, Germany and France forced Japan to return the territory won in Liaodong, leading to a de facto Sino-Russian alliance.

Local Chinese in Manchuria were incensed at these Russian advances and began to harass Russians and Russian institutions, such as the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]]. In June 1900, the Chinese bombarded the town of [[Blagoveshchensk]] on the Russian side of the Amur. The Czar's government used the pretext of Boxer activity to move some 200,000 troops into the area to [[Crushing of boxers in Northern and Central Manchuria|crush the Boxers]]. The Chinese used arson to destroy a bridge carrying a railway and a barracks on 27 July. The [[Boxers attacks on Chinese Eastern Railway|Boxers destroyed railways and cut lines for telegraphs]] and burned the Yantai mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HvhEAAAAIAAJ|title=The Russo-Chinese War|author=George Alexander Lensen|year=1967|publisher=Diplomatic Press|page=14|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 21 September, Russian troops took [[Jilin]] and Liaodong, and by the end of the month completely occupied Manchuria, where their presence was a major factor leading to the [[Russo-Japanese War]].

The Chinese [[Honghuzi]] bandits of Manchuria, who had fought alongside the Boxers in the war, did not stop when the Boxer rebellion was over, and continued guerilla warfare against the Russian occupation up to the [[Russo-Japanese war]] when the Russians were defeated by Japan.

==Massacre of missionaries and Chinese Christians==
[[File:Chinese Martirs.jpg|thumb|The [[Chinese Martyrs|Holy Chinese Martyrs]] of the [[Orthodox Church]] as depicted in an [[icon]] commissioned in 1990]]

Orthodox, Protestant, and Catholic missionaries and their Chinese parishioners were massacred throughout northern China, some by Boxers and others by government troops and authorities. After the declaration of war on Western powers in June 1900, Yuxian, who had been named governor of [[Shanxi]] in March of that year, implemented a brutal anti-foreign and anti-Christian policy. On 9 July, reports circulated that he had executed forty-four foreigners (including women and children) from missionary families whom he had invited to the provincial capital [[Taiyuan]] under the promise to protect them.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p= 51}}{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|pp= 190–191}} Although the purported [[Witness|eye witness]] accounts have recently been questioned as improbable, this event became a notorious symbol of Chinese anger, known as the [[Taiyuan Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger R. Thompson,  "Reporting the Taiyuan Massacre: Culture and Politics in the China War of 1900", in Robert A. Bickers and R. G. Tiedemann, ed., ''The Boxers, China, and the World'' (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007): 65–92. Thompson points out that the widely circulated accounts were by people who could not have seen the events and that these accounts closely followed (often word for word) well known earlier martyr literature.&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer's end, more foreigners and as many as 2,000 Chinese Christians had been put to death in the province. Journalist and historical writer Nat Brandt has called the massacre of Christians in Shanxi "the greatest single tragedy in the history of Christian evangelicalism."&lt;ref&gt;Nat Brandt, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R0GGv-Dio1MC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22massacre%20in%20shansi%22&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;pg=PR13 Massacre in Shansi]'', Syracuse University Press, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Boxer Rebellion as a whole, a total of 136 Protestant missionaries and 53 children were killed, and 47 Catholic priests and nuns. 30,000 Chinese Catholics, 2,000 Chinese Protestants, and 200 to 400 of the 700 Russian Orthodox Christians in Beijing were estimated to have been killed. Collectively, the Protestant dead were called the [[China Martyrs of 1900]].{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 184}} 222 of Russian Christian [[Chinese Martyrs]] including [[Metrophanes, Chi Sung|St. Metrophanes]] were [[canonization|locally canonised]] as [[New Martyrs]] on 22 April 1902, after [[archimandrite]] Innocent (Fugurovsky), head of the Russian Orthodox Mission in China, solicited the [[Most Holy Synod]] to perpetuate their memory.

Beijing, Tianjin, and other cities in northern China were occupied for more than one year by the international expeditionary force under the command of German General [[Alfred von Waldersee|Alfred Graf von Waldersee]]. Atrocities by foreign troops were common. French troops ravaged the countryside around Beijing on behalf of Chinese Catholics. The Americans and British paid General [[Yuan Shikai]] and his army (the [[New Army|Right Division]]) to help the Eight Nation Alliance suppress the Boxers. Yuan Shikai's forces killed tens of thousands of people in their anti Boxer campaign in [[Zhili Province]] and [[Shandong]] after the Alliance captured Beijing.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Warriors of the Rising Sun: A History of the Japanese Military|author=Edgerton, R.B.|date=1997|publisher=Norton|isbn=9780393040852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wkHyjjbv-yEC&amp;pg=PA94|page=94|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuan operated out of [[Baoding]] during the campaign, which ended in 1902.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Yuan Shih-kʻai|author=Ch?ên, J.|date=1972|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804707893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_W-mAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA76|page=76|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Li Hongzhang]] commanded Chinese soldiers to kill "Boxers" to assist the foreign invaders.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Kocvarp., [https://otik.uk.zcu.cz/bitstream/handle/11025/17656/Kocvar.pdf?sequence=1 Germany and the Boxer Uprising in China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311030127/https://otik.uk.zcu.cz/bitstream/handle/11025/17656/Kocvar.pdf?sequence=1 |date=11 March 2016 }}  ''West Bohemian Historical Review'' Vol. 5.2 2015, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Chinese point of view, as well as reports from contemporary Western observers, German, Russian, and Japanese troops received the greatest criticism for their ruthlessness and willingness to wantonly execute Chinese of all ages and backgrounds, sometimes burning and killing entire village populations.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Paul A.

Kaiser Wilhelm II on July 27 during departure ceremonies for the German relief force included an impromptu, but intemperate reference to the [[Hun]] invaders of continental Europe which would later be resurrected by British propaganda to mock Germany during the First World War and Second World War:

::Should you encounter the enemy, he will be defeated! No quarter will be given! Prisoners will not be taken! Whoever falls into your hands is forfeited. Just as a thousand years ago the Huns under their King Attila made a name for themselves, one that even today makes them seem mighty in history and legend, may the name German be affirmed by you in such a way in China that no Chinese will ever again dare to look cross-eyed at a German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilhelm II: "Hun Speech" (1900) ''German History in Documents and Images'' (GHDI) |url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=755 |publisher=germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One newspaper called the aftermath of the siege a "carnival of loot", and others called it "an orgy of looting" by soldiers, civilians and missionaries. These characterisations called to mind the [[Old Summer Palace#Destruction|sacking of the Summer Palace in 1860]].&lt;ref&gt;James L. Hevia, "Looting and Its Discontents: Moral Discourse and the Plunder of Beijing, 1900–1901", in Bickers and Tiedemann, ed., ''The Boxers, China, and the World'' (2007): 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Each nationality accused the others of being the worst looters. An American diplomat, [[Herbert G. Squiers]], filled several railroad cars with loot. The British Legation held loot auctions every afternoon and proclaimed, "looting on the part of British troops was carried out in the most orderly manner." However, one British officer noted, "it is one of the unwritten [[laws of war]] that a city which does not surrender at the last and is taken by storm is looted." For the rest of 1900–1901, the British held loot auctions everyday except Sunday in front of the main-gate to the British Legation. Many foreigners, including [[Claude Maxwell MacDonald|Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald]] and Lady Ethel MacDonald and [[George Ernest Morrison]] of ''[[The Times]]'', were active bidders among the crowd. Many of these looted items ended up in Europe.{{sfnb|Preston|2000|p = 284-285}} The Catholic [[Xishiku Cathedral|Beitang]] or North Cathedral was a "salesroom for stolen property."&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, Wilbur J. letter to his wife (11 December 1900), in ''Ordered to China: Letters of Wilbur J. Chamberlin: Written from China While Under Commission from the New York Sun During the Boxer Uprising of 1900 and the International Complications Which Followed,'' (New York: Frederick A. Stokes, 1903), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
The American commander General [[Adna Chaffee]] banned looting by American soldiers, but the ban was ineffectual.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 194-197}}

Some, but by no means all Western missionaries took an active part in calling for retribution. To provide restitution to missionaries and Chinese Christian families whose property had been destroyed, [[William Scott Ament|William Ament]], a missionary of [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], guided American troops through villages to punish those he suspected of being Boxers and confiscate their property. When [[Mark Twain]] read of this expedition, he wrote a scathing essay, [[s:To the Person Sitting in Darkness|"To the Person Sitting in Darkness"]] that attacked the "Reverend bandits of the American Board,"  especially targeting Ament, one of the most respected missionaries in China.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 207-208 }}  The controversy was front-page news during much of 1901. Ament's counterpart on the distaff side was doughty British missionary Georgina Smith who presided over a neighborhood in Beijing as judge and jury.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 204-214}}

While one historical account reported that Japanese troops were astonished by other Alliance troops raping civilians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XtmzFZS_SX0C&amp;pg=PA301|title=East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History|author1=Patricia Ebrey |author2=Anne Walthall |author3=James Palais |year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=301|isbn=0-547-00534-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; others noted that Japanese troops were 'looting and burning without mercy', and that Chinese 'women and girls by hundreds have committed suicide to escape a worse fate at the hands of Russian and Japanese brutes.'&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Paul A., ''History In Three Keys: The Boxers As Event, Experience, and Myth'', Columbia University Press (1997), {{ISBN|0231106505}}, pp. 184&lt;/ref&gt;  Roger Keyes, who commanded the British destroyer ''[[HMS Fame (1896)|Fame]]'' and accompanied the Gaselee Expedition, noted that the Japanese had brought their own "regimental wives" (prostitutes) to the front to keep their soldiers from raping Chinese civilians.{{sfnb|Preston|2000|p =90, 284–285}} Thousands of Chinese women committed suicide; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' journalist E. J. Dillon stated it was to avoid rape by Alliance forces, and he witnessed the mutilated corpses of Chinese women who were raped and killed by the Alliance troops. The French commander dismissed the rapes, attributing them to "gallantry of the French soldier." A foreign journalist, George Lynch, said "there are things that I must not write, and that may not be printed in England, which would seem to show that this Western civilization of ours is merely a veneer over savagery."{{sfnb|Preston|2000|p = 284-285}}

Many [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] supported the Boxers and shared their anti-foreign sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NUTE8V-WhwoC&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Crossley 1990], p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;  The German Minister [[Clemens von Ketteler]] was assassinated by a Manchu.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QiM2pF5PDR8C&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Rhoads 2000], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Bannermen had been devastated in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895 and Banner armies were destroyed while resisting the invasion.

Under the lead of some highly ranked officials including [[Li Hongzhang]], [[Yuan Shikai]] and [[Zhang Zhidong]], several provinces in the southeast formed the [[The Mutual Protection of Southeast China|Southeastern Mutual Protection]] during this period to avoid the further expansion of the chaos or the worsening of the situation between China and western powers. These provinces claimed to be neutral and refused to fight either the Boxers or the [[Eight Nation Alliance]].

===Reparations===
After the capture of Peking by the foreign armies, some of Empress Dowager Cixi's advisers advocated that the war be carried on, arguing that China could have defeated the foreigners as it was disloyal and traitorous people within China who allowed Beijing and Tianjin to be captured by the Allies, and that the interior of China was impenetrable. They also recommended that Dong Fuxiang continue fighting. The Empress Dowager Cixi was practical, however, and decided that the terms were generous enough for her to acquiesce when she was assured of her continued reign after the war and that China would not be forced to cede any territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWxKQejMtlMC&amp;pg=PA312|title=The Boxer Rebellion: The Dramatic Story of China's War on Foreigners that Shook the World in the Summer of 1900|author=Diana Preston|year=2000|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|page=312|isbn=0-8027-1361-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September 1901, the Qing imperial court agreed to sign the "[[Boxer Protocol]]" also known as Peace Agreement between the Eight-Nation Alliance and China. The protocol ordered the execution of 10 high-ranking officials linked to the outbreak and other officials who were found guilty for the slaughter of foreigners in China. [[Alfons Mumm von Schwarzenstein|Alfons Mumm]] (Freiherr von Schwarzenstein), [[Ernest Satow]] and [[Komura Jutaro]] signed on behalf of Germany, Britain and Japan, respectively.

China was fined [[war reparations]] of 450,000,000 [[tael]]s of fine silver (≈{{convert|540000000|ozt|t}} @ 1.2&amp;nbsp;ozt/tael) for the loss that it caused. The reparation was to be paid within 39 years, and would be 982,238,150 taels with interest (4 percent per year) included. To help meet the payment it was agreed to increase the existing tariff from an actual 3.18 percent to 5 percent, and to tax hitherto duty-free merchandise. The sum of reparation was estimated by the Chinese population (roughly 450&amp;nbsp;million in 1900), to let each Chinese pay one tael. Chinese custom income and salt tax were enlisted as guarantee of the reparation. China paid 668,661,220 taels of silver from 1901 to 1939, equivalent in 2010 to ≈US$61&amp;nbsp;billion on a purchasing power parity basis.&lt;ref name="Hsu, 481"&gt;Hsu, 481&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of the reparations paid to the United States was diverted to pay for the education of Chinese students in U.S. universities under the [[Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program]]. To prepare the students chosen for this program an institute was established to teach the English language and to serve as a preparatory school. When the first of these students returned to China they undertook the teaching of subsequent students; from this institute was born [[Tsinghua University]]. Some of the reparation due to Britain was later earmarked for a similar program.

The [[China Inland Mission]] lost more members than any other missionary agency:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/martyredmission02broogoog |title=Archive.org |publisher=Archive.org |date=10 March 2001 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
58 adults and 21 children were killed. However, in 1901, when the allied nations were demanding compensation from the Chinese government, [[Hudson Taylor]] refused to accept payment for loss of property or life in order to demonstrate the meekness and gentleness of Christ to the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Broomhall (1901), several pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian Catholic vicar apostolic of Ordos, Msgr. Alfons Bermyn wanted foreign troops garrisoned in [[Christianity in Inner Mongolia|Inner Mongolia]], but the Governor refused. Bermyn petitioned the Manchu [[Enming]] to send troops to [[Hetao]] where Prince Duan's Mongol troops and General [[Dong Fuxiang]]'s Muslim troops allegedly threatened Catholics.

==Long-term consequences==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
The European great powers finally ceased their ambitions of colonizing China having learned from the Boxer rebellions that the best way to deal with China was through the ruling dynasty, rather than directly with the Chinese people (a sentiment embodied in the adage: "The people are afraid of officials, the officials are afraid of foreigners, and the foreigners are afraid of the people" ({{zh|c=老百姓怕官，官怕洋鬼子，洋鬼子怕老百姓|labels=no}}), and even briefly assisted the Qing in their war against the Japanese to prevent a Japanese domination in the region.

[[File:French China medal 1900 1901.jpg|thumb|French [[1901 China expedition commemorative medal]]. [[Musée de la Légion d'Honneur]]]]

Concurrently, this period marks the ceding of European great power interference in Chinese affairs, with the Japanese replacing the Europeans as the dominant power for their lopsided involvement in the war against the Boxers as well as their victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. With the toppling of the Qing that followed and the rise of the Nationalist [[Kuomintang]], European sway within China was reduced to symbolic status. After taking Manchuria in 1905, Japan came to dominate Asian affairs both militarily and culturally with many of the Chinese scholars also educated in Japan with the most prominent example being [[Sun Yat-Sen]] who would later found the Nationalist movement of the [[Kuomintang]] in China.

In October 1900, Russia occupied the provinces of Manchuria,&lt;ref name="Paine1996"&gt;{{cite book|first1=S. C. M.|last1=Paine|title=Imperial Rivals: China, Russia, and Their Disputed Frontier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMrx5Rw5n0AC|year=1996|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-1-56324-724-8|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; a move which threatened [[Anglo-American relations|Anglo-American]] hopes of maintaining what remained of China's territorial integrity and the country's openness to commerce under the [[Open Door Policy]].

Japan's clash with Russia over Liaodong and other provinces in eastern Manchuria, due to the Russian refusal to honour the terms of the Boxer protocol which called for their withdrawal, led to the [[Russo-Japanese War]] when two years of negotiations broke down in February 1904. The Russian Lease of the Liaodong (1898) was confirmed. Russia was ultimately defeated by an increasingly confident Japan.

Besides the compensation, [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] reluctantly started some reforms despite her previous views. Under her reforms known as the [[New Policies]] started in 1901, the [[imperial examination]] system for government service was eliminated and as a result the system of [[Chinese classic texts|education through Chinese classics]] was replaced with a [[Liberal arts|European liberal system]] that led to a university degree. Along with the formation of new military and police organisations, the reforms also simplified central bureaucracy and made a start on revamping taxation policies.&lt;ref name="Benedict1996"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Carol Ann|last1=Benedict|title=Bubonic Plague in Nineteenth-Century China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxa7jcVIR9MC|year=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2661-0|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the deaths of Cixi and the [[Guangxu Emperor]] in 1908, the [[prince regent]] [[Zaifeng, Prince Chun|Zaifeng (Prince Chun)]], the Guangxu Emperor's brother, launched further reforms.

The effect on China was a weakening of the dynasty and its national defense capabilities. The government structure was temporarily sustained by the Europeans. Behind the international conflict, it further deepened internal ideological differences between northern-Chinese anti-foreign royalists and southern-Chinese anti-Qing revolutionists. This scenario in the last years of the Qing dynasty gradually escalated into a chaotic [[warlord era]] in which the most powerful northern warlords were hostile towards the revolutionaries in the south who overthrew the Qing monarchy in 1911. The rivalry was not fully resolved until the northern warlords were defeated by the [[Kuomintang]]'s 1926–28 [[Northern Expedition]]. Prior to the final defeat of the Boxer Rebellion, all anti-Qing movements in the previous century, such as the [[Taiping Rebellion]], had been successfully suppressed by the Qing.

Historian [[Walter LaFeber]] has argued that President [[William McKinley]]'s decision to send 5,000 American troops to quell the rebellion marks "the origins of modern presidential war powers":&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Woods|Woods, Thomas]] (7 July 2005) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/woods/woods45.html Presidential War Powers], [[LewRockwell.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

::McKinley took a historic step in creating a new, 20th century presidential power. He dispatched the five thousand troops without consulting Congress, let alone obtaining a declaration of war, to fight the Boxers who were supported by the Chinese government ... Presidents had previously used such force against non-governmental groups that threatened U.S. interests and citizens. It was now used, however, against recognised governments, and without obeying the [[War Powers Clause|Constitution's provisions about who was to declare war]].

[[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] concurred, writing that:&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.|Schlesinger, Arthur]]. ''[[The Imperial Presidency]]'' (Popular Library 1974), pg. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

::The intervention in China marked the start of a crucial shift in the presidential employment of armed force overseas. In the 19th century, military force committed without congressional authorization had been typically used against nongovernmental organizations. Now it was beginning to be used against sovereign states, and, in the case of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], with less consultation than ever.

In the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], when the Japanese asked the Muslim general [[Ma Hongkui]] to defect and become head of a Muslim puppet state, he responded that his relatives had been killed during the Battle of Peking, including his uncle [[Ma Fulu]]. Since Japanese troops made up the majority of the Alliance forces there would be no cooperation with the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=LEI |first=Wan |date=February 2010 |title=The Chinese Islamic "Goodwill Mission to the Middle East" During the Anti-Japanese War |url=https://www.academia.edu/4427135/The_Chinese_Islamic_Goodwill_Mission_to_the_Middle_East_-_Japonyaya_Karsi_Savasta_Cinli_Muslumanlarin_Orta_Dogu_iyi_Niyet_Heyeti_-_Wan_LEI |journal=DÎvÂn Disiplinlerarasi Çalismalar Dergisi |volume=cilt 15 |issue=sayı 29 |pages=133–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and changing views of the Boxers==

From the beginning, views differed as to whether the Boxers were better seen as anti-imperialist, patriotic, and proto-nationalist or as "uncivilized", irrational, and futile opponents of inevitable change. The historian Joseph Esherick comments that "confusion about the Boxer Uprising is not simply a matter of popular misconceptions", for "there is no major incident in China's modern history on which the range of professional interpretation is as great".{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p= xiv }}

Chinese liberals such as [[Hu Shih|Hu Shi]] often condemned the Boxers for their irrationality and barbarity.&lt;ref&gt;顾则徐：清末民初思想领袖评价义和团总览&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]], the founding father of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] Party at first believed that the Boxer Movement was stirred up by the Qing government's rumors, which "caused confusion among the populace", and delivered "scathing criticism" of the Boxers' "anti-foreignism and obscurantism". Sun praised the Boxers for their "spirit of resistance" but called them "bandits". Students shared an ambivalent attitude to the Boxers, stating that while the uprising originated from the "ignorant and stubborn people of the interior areas", their beliefs were "brave and righteous", and could "be transformed into a moving force for independence".&lt;ref name="Han 20, 21"&gt;{{cite book|last=Han|first=Xiaorong |title=Chinese discourses on the peasant, 1900–1949 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oxTe1YYZa7MC&amp;pg=PA20|date=February 2005|publisher= State University of New York Press|isbn=0791463192|pages=20, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, nationalist Chinese became more sympathetic to the Boxers.

In other countries, views of the Boxers were complex and contentious. [[Mark Twain]] said that "the Boxer is a patriot. He loves his country better than he does the countries of other people. I wish him success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Twain|first=Mark |title=Mark Twain Speeches |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dhWMWs_7J3UC&amp;pg=PA116|date=7 November 2007|publisher=|isbn=978-1-4346-7879-9|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian writer [[Leo Tolstoy]] also praised the Boxers. He accused Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm II of Germany of being chiefly responsible for the lootings, rapes, murders and the "Christian brutality" of the Russians and other western troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=k1_iAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=he+praised+the+Chinese+for+their+heroic+patience.+When+he+learned+about+the+%22orgy+of+murder,+raping,+and+looting%22+committed+by+the+Western+powers+in+quelling+the+Boxer+rebellion,+he+raged+against+the+brutality+of+the+Christians|title=The Russian review, Volume 19|author=William Henry Chamberlin |year=1960|publisher=Blackwell|page=115|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]] mocked the Russian government's claim that it was protecting [[Christian civilization]]: "Poor Imperial Government! So Christianly unselfish, and yet so unjustly maligned! Several years ago it unselfishly seized Port Arthur, and now it is unselfishly seizing Manchuria; it has unselfishly flooded the frontier provinces of China with hordes of contractors, engineers, and officers, who, by their conduct, have roused to indignation even the Chinese, known for their docility."&lt;ref&gt;V. I.  Lenin, "The War in China", ''Iskra'', No. 1 (December 1900), in ''Lenin Collected Works'' (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1964), Volume 4, pages 372–377, online [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1900/dec/china.htm Marxists Internet Archive].&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Bengali Hindu [[Rabindranath Tagore]] attacked the European colonialists.&lt;ref name="Bickers2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A.

Even some American churchmen spoke out in support of the Boxers. The evangelist Rev. Dr. [[George F. Pentecost]] said that the Boxer uprising was a "patriotic movement to expel the 'foreign devils' — just that — the foreign devils". Suppose, he said, the great nations of Europe were to “put their fleets together, came over here, seize Portland, move on down to Boston, then New York, then Philadelphia, and so on down the Atlantic Coast and around the Gulf of Galveston? Suppose they took possession of these port cities, drove our people into the hinterland, built great warehouses and factories, brought in a body of dissolute agents, and calmly notified our people that henceforward they would manage the commerce of the country? Would we not have a Boxer movement to drive those foreign European Christian devils out of our country?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=11 February 1912 |title=

[[File:Boxer1900.jpg|upright|thumb|A Boxer during the revolt]]

The Russian newspaper ''Amurskii Krai'' criticized the killing of innocent civilians, charging that "restraint" "civilization" and "culture" instead of "racial hatred" and "destruction" would have been more becoming of a "civilized Christian nation". The paper asked "What shall we tell civilized people? We shall have to say to them: 'Do not consider us as brothers anymore. We are mean and terrible people; we have killed those who hid at our place, who sought our protection'".&lt;ref name="LensenChʻen1982"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Alexander Lensen|author2=Fang-chih Chʻen|title=The Russo-Chinese War: |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ehhSAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=midst+confidently+blemish+The+Russo-Chinese+War:+Chinese|year=1982|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events also left a longer impact. The historian Robert Bickers found that for the British in China the Boxer rising served as the "equivalent of the Indian 'mutiny'" and came to represent the [[Yellow Peril]]. Later events, he adds, such as the [[Northern Expedition|Chinese Nationalist Revolution]] of the 1920s and even the activities of the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] of the 1960s, were perceived as being in the shadow of the Boxers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bickers, ''Britain in China: Community, Culture, and Colonialism, 1900–1949'' (Manchester; New York: Manchester University Press, distributed in the US by St. Martin's Press,  1999 {{ISBN|0719046971}}), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Taiwan]]  and [[Hong Kong]], history textbooks often present the Boxer as irrational. But in the [[People's Republic of China]], government textbooks described the Boxer movement as an anti-imperialist, patriotic peasant movement whose failure was due to the lack of leadership from the modern working class, and described the international army as an invading force. In recent decades, however, large-scale projects of village interviews and explorations of archival sources have led historians in China to take a more nuanced view. Some non-Chinese scholars, such as Joseph Esherick, have seen the movement as anti-imperialist; while others hold that the concept "nationalistic" is anachronistic because the Chinese nation had not been formed and the Boxers were more concerned with regional issues. Paul Cohen's recent study includes a survey of "the Boxers as myth", showing how their memory was used in changing ways in 20th-century China from the [[New Culture Movement]] to the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Pt Three, "The Boxers As Myth", Cohen, ''History in Three Keys'', pp. 211–288.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the Boxer question has been debated in the People's Republic of China. In 1998, the critical scholar Wang Yi argued that the Boxers had features in common with the extremism of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Both events had the external goal of "liquidating all harmful pests" and the domestic goal of "eliminating bad elements of all descriptions" and this relation was rooted in "cultural obscurantism". Wang explained to his readers the changes in attitudes towards the Boxers from the condemnation of the May Fourth Movement to the approval expressed by [[Mao Zedong]] during the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Wang Yi, "The Cultural Origins of the Boxer Movement's Obscurantism and Its Influence on the Cultural Revolution", in Douglas Kerr, ed., ''Critical Zone Three.'' (Hong Kong University Press), 155.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 [[Yuan Weishi]], a professor of philosophy at [[Zhongshan University]] in Guangzhou, wrote that the Boxers by their "criminal actions brought unspeakable suffering to the nation and its people! These are all facts that everybody knows, and it is a national shame that the Chinese people cannot forget".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20060126_1.htm|title=History Textbooks in China|publisher=Eastsouthwestnorth|accessdate=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuan charged that history text books had been lacking in neutrality in presenting the Boxer Uprising as a "magnificent feat of patriotism", and not presenting the view that the majority of the Boxer rebels were violent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/24/AR2006012401003.html|title=Leading Publication Shut Down In China |date= 25 January 2006|publisher=Washington Post Foreign Service|accessdate=19 October 2008 | first=Philip P. | last=Pan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, some labeled Yuan Weishi a "traitor" ([[Hanjian]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060308103607/http://www.snzg.com.cn/readnews.asp?newsid=1082 网友评论：评中山大学袁时伟的汉奸言论和混蛋逻辑]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The first reports coming from China in 1898 referred to the village activists as "Yihequan", (Wade–Giles: I Ho Ch'uan). The first known use of the term "Boxer" was September 1899 in a letter from missionary Grace Newton in Shandong. It appears from context that "Boxer" was a known term by that time, possibly coined by the Shandong missionaries [[Arthur Henderson Smith|Arthur H. Smith]] and Henry Porter.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 223}} Smith says in his book of 1902 that the name
&lt;blockquote&gt;I Ho Ch'uan... literally denotes the 'Fists' (Ch'uan) of Righteousness (or Public) (I) Harmony (Ho), in apparent allusion to the strength of united force which was to be put forth. As the Chinese phrase 'fists and feet' signifies boxing and wrestling, there appeared to be no more suitable term for the adherents of the sect than 'Boxers,' a designation first used by one or two missionary correspondents of foreign journals in China, and later universally accepted on account of the difficulty of coining a better one.&lt;ref&gt;''China in Convulsion'' Vol I, pp. 154–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On 6 June 1900 the ''Times'' of London used the term "rebellion" in quotation marks, presumably to indicate their view that the rising was in fact instigated by Empress Dowager Cixi.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Elliot, ''Some Did It for Civilisation''", p. 9, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Lanxin Xiang refers to the "so called 'Boxer Rebellion,'" and explains that "while peasant rebellion was nothing new in Chinese history, a war against the world's most powerful states was."&lt;ref&gt;Xiang, ''The Origins of the Boxer War'' p. vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Boxer Rebellion", concludes Joseph Esherick, another recent historian, is truly a "misnomer", for the Boxers "never rebelled against the Manchu rulers of China and their Qing dynasty" and the "most common Boxer slogan, throughout the history of the movement, was "support the Qing, destroy the Foreign." He adds that only after the movement was suppressed by the Allied Intervention did both the foreign powers and influential Chinese officials realize that the Qing would have to remain as government of China in order to maintain order and collect taxes to pay the indemnity. Therefore, in order to save face for the Empress Dowager and the imperial court, the argument was made that the Boxers were rebels and that support from the imperial court came only from a few Manchu princes. Esherick concludes that the origin of the term "rebellion" was "purely political and opportunistic", but it has shown a remarkable staying power, particularly in popular accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Esherick p. xiv. Esherick notes that many textbooks and secondary accounts followed Victor Purcell, ''The Boxer Uprising: A Background Study'' (1963) in seeing a shift from an early anti-dynastic movement to pro-dynastic, but that the "flood of publications" from Taiwan and the People's Republic (including both documents from the time and oral histories conducted in the 1950s) has shown this not to be the case. xv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other recent Western works refer to the "Boxer Movement", "Boxer War" or Yihetuan Movement, while Chinese studies use 义和团运动 (Yihetuan yundong), that is, "Yihetuan Movement." In his discussion of the general and legal implications of the terminology involved, the German scholar Thoralf Klein notes that all of the terms, including the Chinese ones, are "posthumous interpretations of the conflict." He argues that each term, whether it be "uprising", "rebellion" or "movement" implies a different definition of the conflict. Even the term "Boxer War", which has become widely used by recent scholars in the West, raises questions, as war was never declared, and Allied troops behaved as a punitive expedition in colonial style, not in a declared war with legal constraints. The Allies took advantage of the fact that China had not signed "The Laws and Customs of War on Land", a key document at the 1899 [[Hague Peace Conference]]. They argued that China had violated its provisions but themselves ignored them. {{sfnb|Klein|2008}}

By 1900, many new forms of media had matured, including illustrated newspapers and magazines, postcards, broadsides and advertisements, all of which presented images of the Boxers and of the invading armies.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Perdue, "[http://video.mit.edu/watch/mit-visualizing-cultures-visualizing-the-boxer-uprising-10054/ Visualizing the Boxer Uprising]" MIT Visualizing Cultures Illustrated Slide Lecture&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion was covered in the foreign illustrated press by artists and photographers.

London: Greenhill, 2000. {{ISBN|1-85367-409-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decades, the Boxers were a constant subject for comment. A sampling includes:

* In the Polish play ''[[The Wedding (1901 play)|The Wedding]]'' by [[Stanisław Wyspiański]], first published on 16 March 1901, even before the rebellion was finally crushed, the character of Czepiec asks the Journalist (''Dziennikarz'') one of the best-known questions in the history of Polish literature: ''"Cóż tam, panie, w polityce? Chińczyki trzymają się mocno!?'' (''"How are things in politics, Mister? Are the Chinese holding out firmly!?"'').&lt;ref name="Wesele"&gt;{{cite web|author=met [2007-08-26] |url=http://broszka.pl/chincyki-trzymaja-sie-mocno,a |title=''Chińcyki trzymają się mocno!?'' |publisher=Broszka.pl |date=26 August 2007 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Liu E]], ''[[The Travels of Lao Can]]''&lt;ref&gt;translated by Harold Shaddick as ''The Travels of Lao Ts'an'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1952), also available in an abridged version which omits some scenes of the Boxers: ''The travels of Lao Can'', translated by Yang Xianyi, Gladys Yang (Beijing: Panda Books, 1983; 176p.),&lt;/ref&gt; sympathetically shows an honest official trying to carry out reforms and depicts the Boxers as sectarian rebels.
* [[G. A. Henty]], ''With the Allies to Pekin, a Tale of the Relief of the Legations'' (New York: Scribners, 1903; London: Blackie, 1904). Juvenile fiction by a widely read author, depicts the Boxers as "a mob of ruffians."
* A false or forged diary, ''Diary of his Excellency Ching-Shan: Being a Chinese Account of the Boxer Troubles'', including text written by [[Sir Edmund Backhouse, 2nd Baronet|Edmund Backhouse]], who claimed he recovered the document from a burnt building. It is suspected that Backhouse falsified the document, as well as other stories, because he was prone to tell tales dubious in nature, including claims of nightly visits to the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]: ''A Hidden Life – The Enigma of Sir Edmund Backhouse'' (Published in the USA as ''Hermit of Peking, The Hidden Life of Sir Edmund Backhouse'') (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', Tintin's Chinese friend [[Chang Chong-Chen]] when they first meet, after Tintin saves the boy from drowning, the boy asks Tintin why he saved him from drowning as, according to Chang's uncle who fought in the Rebellion, all white people were wicked.
* The novel ''[[Moment in Peking]]'' (1939), by [[Lin Yutang]], opens during the Boxer Rebellion, and provides a child's-eye view of the turmoil through the eyes of the protagonist.
* ''[[Tulku (novel)|Tulku]]'', a 1979 children's novel by [[Peter Dickinson]], includes the effects of the Boxer Rebellion on a remote part of China.
* ''[[The Diamond Age]] or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer'' (New York, 1996), by [[Neal Stephenson]], includes a quasi-historical re-telling of the Boxer Rebellion as an integral component of the novel
* The novel ''[[The Palace of Heavenly Pleasure]]'' (2003), by Adam Williams, describes the experiences of a small group of foreign missionaries, traders and railway engineers in a fictional town in northern China shortly before and during the Boxer Rebellion.
* Illusionist William Ellsworth Robinson a.k.a. [[Chung Ling Soo]] had a [[bullet catch]] trick entitled "Condemned to Death by the Boxers", which famously resulted in his onstage death.
* The 1963 film ''[[55 Days at Peking]]'' directed by [[Nicholas Ray]] and starring [[Charlton Heston]], [[Ava Gardner]] and [[David Niven]].&lt;ref name="days"&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0056800|title=55 Days at Peking}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1975 Hong Kong's [[Shaw Brothers]] studio produced the film ''Boxer Rebellion'' ({{zh|t=八國聯軍|p=bāguó liánjūn|w=Pa kuo lien chun|l=Eight-Nation Allied Army}}) under director [[Chang Cheh]] with one of the highest budgets to tell a sweeping story of disillusionment and revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.533288/qx/details.htm |title=HKflix |publisher=HKflix |date= |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hong Kong's [[Shaw Brothers]] ''[[Legendary Weapons of China]]'' (1981), director [[Lau Kar Leung]]. A comedy starring [[Hsiao Ho (actor)|Hsiao Ho]] (Hsiao Hou) as a disillusioned boxer of the Magic Clan who is sent to assassinate the former leader of a powerful boxer clan who refuses to dupe his students into believing they are impervious to firearms.
* There are several flashbacks to the Boxer Rebellion in the television shows ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]].'' During the conflict, [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] kills his first slayer to impress [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]], and [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] decisively splits from [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]].
* The 2003 film, ''[[Shanghai Knights]],'' starring [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]], shows that the Boxers still exist, working for Lord Rathbone, who wants to assassinate many members of the British Royal Family.
* ''[[The Last Empress (novel)|The Last Empress]]'' (Boston, 2007), by [[Anchee Min]], describes the long reign of the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] in which the siege of the legations is one of the climactic events in the novel.
* [[Mo Yan|Mo, Yan]]. ''Sandalwood Death.'' Viewpoint of villagers during Boxer Uprising.&lt;ref&gt;''Sandalwood Death''  (Translated by Howard Goldblatt. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2013. {{ISBN|9780806143392}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The pair of [[graphic novel]]s by [[Gene Luen Yang]], with colour by Lark Pien, ''[[Boxers and Saints]],'' describes the "bands of foreign missionaries and soldiers" who "roam the countryside bullying and robbing Chinese peasants." Little Bao, "harnessing the powers of ancient Chinese gods", recruits an army of Boxers, "commoners trained in [[kung fu]] who fight to free China from 'foreign devils.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Boxers and Saints'' (First Second Books, 2013 {{ISBN|1596439246}})[http://www.worldcat.org/title/boxers-saints-boxed-set/oclc/825754024&amp;referer=brief_results WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2013 video game ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' featured the Boxer Rebellion as a major historical moment for the floating city of Columbia. Columbia, in an effort to rescue American hostages during the rebellion, opened fire upon the city of Peking and burned it to the ground. These actions resulted in the United States recalling Columbia, which led to its secession from the Union.
* The Boxer Rebellion is the historical backdrop for the episode titled "Kung Fu Crabtree" (Season 7, Episode 16, aired 24 March 2014) of the television series ''[[Murdoch Mysteries]],'' when Chinese officials visit Toronto in 1900 in search of Boxers who have fled from China.

'''Euphoria''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|audio=en-us-euphoria.ogg|juː|ˈ|f|ɔːr|i|ə}}) is the experience (or [[affect (psychology)|affect]]) of [[pleasure]] or excitement and intense feelings of [[well-being]] and [[happiness]].&lt;ref name="Euphoria definition"&gt;{{Cite book|year=2015|title="Addicted to Euphoria": The History, Clinical Presentation, and Management of Party Drug Misuse|journal=Int.

However, in our view, cognitive processes, are only one “slice of the pie”, and gamma oscillations may be more globally viewed as the overall emotional–motivational neurodynamics through which the SEEKING disposition is expressed, accompanied by a feeling of excitement/eurphoria (not ‘pleasure’) that is evolutionarily designed to achieve a diversity of useful outcomes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[natural rewards]] and social activities, such as [[aerobic exercise]], [[laughter]], listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria.&lt;ref name="DSM4phrases"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatewaypsychiatric.com/key-dsm-iv-mental-status-exam-phrases|title=Key DSM-IV Mental Status Exam Phrases|publisher=Gateway Psychiatric Services|accessdate=17 February 2014|at = Mood and Affect|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131113061611/https://www.gatewaypsychiatric.com/key-dsm-iv-mental-status-exam-phrases|archivedate = 13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Primary-Rower's high definition"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen EE, Ejsmond-Frey R, Knight N, Dunbar RI | title = Rowers' high: behavioural synchrony is correlated with elevated pain thresholds | journal = Biol.

Moreover, the early stages of a new, romantic relationship can be a powerful and absorbing experience. Individuals in new romantic relationships report feeling euphoric and energetic. They also become emotionally dependent on, desire closeness with, and have highly focused attention on their partner (Reynaud et al. 2010; Young 2009). Human neuroimaging studies have shown that feelings experienced during the early stages of a romantic relationship are associated with neural activations in several reward-system and affect-processing regions of the brain (Young 2009; Aron et al. 2005; Bartels &amp; Zeki 2000; Mashek, Aron &amp; Fisher 2000).&lt;!--It has been found that deltaFosB gene in the NAc is critical for reinforcing effects of sexual reward.

To our knowledge, the first experimental study aimed at investigating the influence of PA on ECS in humans was carried out in 2003 by Sparling and coworkers [63], who showed increased plasma AEA content after 45 min of moderate intensity exercise on a treadmill or cycle ergometer. Since then, other human studies have shown increased blood concentrations of AEA&amp;nbsp;... A dependence of the increase of AEA concentration on exercise intensity has also been documented.

===Music euphoria===
{{See also|Frisson}}
Euphoria can occur as a result of dancing to music, music-making, and listening to emotionally arousing music.&lt;ref name="Primary-Rower's high definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21217764"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salimpoor VN, Benovoy M, Larcher K, Dagher A, Zatorre RJ | title = Anatomically distinct dopamine release during anticipation and experience of peak emotion to music | journal = Nat.

Musical stimuli can significantly increase extracellular DA levels in the NA. NA DA and serotonin were found significantly higher in animals exposed to music. Finally, passive listening to unfamiliar although liked music showed activations in the NA.&amp;nbsp;... Music can arouse feelings of euphoria and craving, similar to tangible rewards that involve the striatal DAergic system [16]. Reward value for music can be coded by activity levels in the NA, whose functional connectivity with auditory and frontal areas increases as a function of increasing musical reward [19].&amp;nbsp;... Listening to pleasant music induces a strong response and significant activation of the VTA-mediated interaction of the NA with the hypothalamus, insula and orbitofrontal cortex [1].&lt;br /&gt;'''Conclusions'''&lt;br /&gt;Listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing including the NA. Music, acting as a positive pleasant emotion, increases NA DAergic activity. Specifically the NA is more involved during the experience of peak emotional responses to music. Reward value of music can be predicted by increased functional connectivity of auditory cortices, amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal regions with the NA. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the NA role in the influence of music in our lives.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the [[reward system]] plays a central role in mediating music-induced pleasure.&lt;ref name="Music - NAcc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Music - reward system" /&gt; Pleasurable emotionally arousing music strongly increases [[dopamine]] neurotransmission in the [[dopaminergic pathway]]s that project to the [[striatum]] (i.e., the [[mesolimbic pathway]] and [[nigrostriatal pathway]]).&lt;ref name="pmid21217764" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Music - NAcc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Music - reward system"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zatorre RJ | title = Musical pleasure and reward: mechanisms and dysfunction | journal = Ann.

Neuroimaging studies show that the reward system of the human brain is central to this experience. Specifically, the dorsal and ventral striatum release dopamine when listening to pleasurable music, and activity in these structures also codes the reward value of musical excerpts. Moreover, the striatum interacts with cortical mechanisms involved in perception and valuation of musical stimuli.&amp;nbsp;... Development of a questionnaire for music reward experiences has allowed the identification of separable factors associated with musical pleasure, described as music-seeking, emotion-evocation, mood regulation, sensorimotor, and social factors. Applying this questionnaire to a large sample uncovered approximately 5% of the population with low sensitivity to musical reward in the absence of generalized anhedonia or depression. Further study of this group revealed that there are individuals who respond normally both behaviorally and psychophysiologically to rewards other than music (e.g., monetary value) but do not experience pleasure from music despite normal music perception ability and preserved ability to identify intended emotions in musical passages. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately&amp;nbsp;5% of the population experiences a phenomenon termed "musical [[anhedonia]]", in which individuals do not experience pleasure from listening to emotionally arousing music despite having the ability to perceive the intended emotion that is conveyed in passages of music.&lt;ref name="Music - reward system" /&gt;

===Copulation-induced===

A '''euphoriant''' is a type of [[psychoactive drug]] which tends to induce euphoria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/euphoriant Merrian-Webster definition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/euphoriant |title=euphoriant |work=Memidex/WordNet Dictionary |accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most euphoriants are [[addictive drugs]] due to their [[reinforcement|reinforcing properties]] and ability to activate the [[brain]]'s [[reward system]].&lt;ref name="NHM-DA stims, opioids, nicotine, cannabinoids, inhalants, corticoids" /&gt;

Although short-term administration of glucocorticoids often produces euphoria and increased energy, the impact of long-lasting increases in endogenous glucocorticoids produced during depression can involve complex adaptations such as those that occur in Cushing syndrome (Chapter 10).&amp;nbsp;...

====Opioids====
[[µ-Opioid receptor]] [[agonist]]s are a set of euphoriants&lt;ref name="NHM-DA stims, opioids, nicotine, cannabinoids, inhalants, corticoids" /&gt; that include drugs such as [[heroin]], [[morphine]], [[codeine]], [[oxycodone]], and [[fentanyl]]. By contrast, [[κ-opioid receptor]]  agonists, like the endogenous [[neuropeptide]] ''[[dynorphin]]'', are known to cause [[dysphoria]],&lt;ref name="NHM-DA stims, opioids, nicotine, cannabinoids, inhalants, corticoids" /&gt; a mood state opposite to euphoria that involves feelings of profound discontent.

====Cannabinoids====
[[Cannabinoid receptor 1]] agonists are a group of euphoriants that includes certain [[Phytocannabinoids|plant-based cannabinoids]] (e.g., [[tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] from the [[cannabis]] plant), [[endocannabinoids|endogenous cannabinoids]] (e.g., [[anandamide]]), and [[synthetic cannabinoid]]s.&lt;ref name="NHM-DA stims, opioids, nicotine, cannabinoids, inhalants, corticoids" /&gt;

====Inhalants====
Certain gases, like [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, aka "laughing gas"), can induce euphoria when inhaled.&lt;ref name="NHM-DA stims, opioids, nicotine, cannabinoids, inhalants, corticoids" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Huang C, Johnson N|year=2016|title=Nitrous Oxide, From the Operating Room to the Emergency Department |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4819505/pdf/40138_2016_Article_92.pdf|journal=Current Emergency and Hospital Medicine Reports|volume=4|page=16&lt;!--|pages=11–18--&gt;|doi=10.1007/s40138-016-0092-3|issn=2167-4884|pmc=4819505|pmid=27073749|quote=The term 'laughing gas' is a common layman’s term for nitrous oxide, given its ability to create a sense of euphoria in the user.

====Glucocorticoids====
Acute exogenous [[glucocorticoid]] administration is known to produce euphoria, but this effect is not observed with long-term exposure.&lt;ref name="NHM-DA stims, opioids, nicotine, cannabinoids, inhalants, corticoids" /&gt;

====Mania====
Euphoria is also strongly associated with both [[hypomania]] and [[mania]], mental states characterized by a pathological heightening of mood, which may be either euphoric or irritable, in addition to other symptoms, such as [[pressured speech]], [[flight of ideas]], and [[grandiosity]].&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book | title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) | section-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-JivBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT272#v=onepage&amp;q=manic%20euphoria | section=Bipolar and Related Disorders | edition=5th | isbn=9780890425572 | publisher=American Psychiatric Association | year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruggero"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruggero CJ, Kotov R, Watson D, Kilmer JN, Perlman G, Liu K | title = Beyond a single index of mania symptoms: structure and validity of subdimensions | journal = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8024">'''Fragmentalism''' is a view that holds that the world consists of individual and independent objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kukla A|title=Antirealist Explanations of the Success of Science|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=63|issue=1|pages=S298–S305|year=1996|doi=10.1086/289964|jstor=188539}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term contends that the world is indeed composed of separable parts, and that it is chiefly knowable through the study of these component parts, rather than through wholes. It therefore stands opposed to holistic interpretations of phenomena.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Fragmentalists carved the universe up into smaller and smaller pieces until they reached such a fine level of subdivision that they could no longer observe the pieces directly." (Stewart &amp; Cohen, p.198) "As the tale of the Fragmentalists demonstrates, reductionist science usually looks for a mathematical equation, formula, or process that describes general features of the universe." (Stewart &amp; Cohen, p.200)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fragmentalism has also been defined as ''the notion that knowledge is a growing collection of substantiated facts or "nuggets of truth."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pope ML|title=Personal construction of formal knowledge|journal=Interchange|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/VQ4L33X920880824.pdf|volume=13|issue=4|pages=3–14|year=1982|doi=10.1007/BF01191417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-realism|Anti-realists]] use the term fragmentalism in arguments that the world does not exist of separable [[entity|entities]], instead consisting of wholes. For example, advocates of this position declare that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The linear deterministic approach to nature and technology promoted a fragmented perception of reality, and a loss of the ability to foresee, to adequately evaluate, in all their complexity, global crises in ecology, civilization and education.&lt;ref&gt;Anatoly P. Liferov, Global Education as a Trend Reflecting the Problems of Today and Meeting the Requirements of Tomorrow http://www.indiana.edu/~isre/NEWSLETTER/vol6no2/global.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This term is usually applied to [[reductionism|reductionist]] modes of thought, frequently with the related pejorative term of ''[[scientism]]''. This usage is popular amongst some ecological activists: &lt;blockquote&gt;There is a need now to move away from [[scientism]] and the ideology of cause-and-effect determinism toward a radical [[empiricism]], such as [[William James]] proposed, as an [[epistemology]] of science.&lt;ref&gt;Yunkaporta on Kakkib and Oneness, Tyson Yunkaporta, Friday, January 05, 2007 http://bioregionalanimism.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; These perspectives are not new and in the early twentieth century, [[William James]] noted that rationalist science emphasized what he termed fragmentation and disconnection.&lt;ref name=Lumpkin/&gt;
 Such anti-realist rhetoric also underpins many criticisms of the scientific method: &lt;blockquote&gt;The scientific method only acknowledges monophasic consciousness. The method is a specialized system that focuses on studying small and distinctive parts in isolation, which results in fragmented knowledge.&lt;ref name=Lumpkin&gt;Tara W. Lumpkin, ''Perceptual Diversity: Is Polyphasic Consciousness Necessary for Global Survival?'' December 28, 2006, http://bioregionalanimism.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An alternative usage of this term is in [[cognitive psychology]]. Here, [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] developed "constructive alternativism" as a form of [[personal construct psychology]], this provided an alternative to what he saw as "accumulative fragmentalism". In this theory, knowledge is seen as the construction of successful mental models of the exterior world, rather than the accumulation of independent "nuggets of truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pope ML and Watts M|title=Constructivist Goggles: Implications for Process in Teaching and Learning Physics|journal=Eur. J. Physics|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0143-0807/9/2/004|volume=9|pages=101–109|year=1988|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/9/2/004|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also has ancillary uses in education,&lt;ref&gt;[http://construct.haifa.ac.il/~ilangz/oxford/gur-zeev.pdf Gur-Ze'ev, Ilan, ''Toward a New Critical Language in Education,'' in Gur-Ze'ev, Ilan, (Ed.), ''Critical Theory and Critical Pedagogy Today: Toward a New Critical Language in Education,'' Haifa: University of Haifa Press, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; in design theory,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designtrain-ldv.com/activitie7/63-ssalbacak.pdf Salih Salbacak, ''Starting Design Education: Basic Design Course,” Designtrain 2008, Amsterdam, Netherlands, June 05–07, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Knopfelmacher''' ([[Vienna]], 3 February 1923&amp;nbsp;– [[Melbourne]], 17 May 1995), was a [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] [[Jew]],&lt;ref name=Andknop&gt;Knopfelmacher, Andrew (subject's son): [http://www.pwhce.org/textknop.html The Nine Lives of Frank Knopfelmacher] at pwhce.org, 21 March 2002. Retrieved 23 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=October 2016}} who migrated to [[Australia]] in 1955 and became a [[psychology|psychology lecturer]] and [[anticommunism|anticommunist]] [[advocacy journalism|political commentator]] at the [[University of Melbourne]]. He was embroiled in virulent political controversies during the [[Vietnam War]]-era, the 1960s and 1970s.

==Early life==
He was born into an upper-middle-class Czech Jewish family in [[Vienna]] and enjoyed a happy childhood until the [[Anschluss]], the annexation of Austria in 1938. Realising the personal danger, he fled the country in November 1939 with other members of a [[Zionist]] youth group, to join a [[kibbutz]] in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. In January 1942 he joined the Communist Party and spent the remainder of [[World War II]] as a member of the Free Czech Forces, attached to the [[British Army]]. The family that he had left in Vienna all perished in [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name=Andknop/&gt;{{Better source|date=October 2016}}

Once [[Prague]], where he had returned in 1945, had been taken over by the Communists. Reading [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' had soured him from them, and he used money from his family estate to bribe officials into letting him flee to [[England]]. He thereafter detested the [[Soviet Union]] and continued to revere the man [[Karl Marx]], whom, as late as July 1983, he defended, in a ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'' article)&lt;ref&gt;Knopfelmacher, F. (1983) As I please: In (mild) defence of Karl Marx. ''Quadrant'' 27, 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Academic career==
Knopfelmacher completed a doctorate in philosophy and psychology at the [[University of Bristol]]. In 1955, he moved to Melbourne and took up a lectureship at University of Melbourne's Psychology Department.

Few outside professional circles had heard of him until 1965, when he applied and was approved for a post in political philosophy at the [[University of Sydney]] but had his appointment blocked, in what became a front-page ''cause célèbre'', by the University Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Full details may be found in Robert Scoble, "The Knopfelmacher Case" in ''Quadrant'', Sept-Oct 1971, pp.72-82.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Senate considered Knopfelmacher's published criticisms of [[Moscow]], and its apologists, to be unduly strong meat. He had written of Melbourne leftists that "like rats, they wish to operate in the dark" (''Twentieth Century'' magazine, Volume 18, 1964). Those firmly supporting him included [[Sydney]] philosopher [[David Malet Armstrong]], who called Knopfelmacher "a man fatally ahead of his time by a few years. A short time afterwards academic rebels were saying pretty much anything they liked, how they liked, about their opponents. If anyone tried to censure them or impede their careers as a result of this, the shouts that their academic freedom had been violated were deafening. To Knopfelmacher, however... [[Saki]]'s saying applied: it is the first Christian martyr who gets the hungriest lion."&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, ''Corrupting the Youth: A History of Philosophy in Australia'' (Macleay Press, Sydney, 2003), [http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/corruptingtheyouthch11.pdf ch. 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with right-wing figures==
A close associate, [[Bob Santamaria]], stated (in his 1969 book ''Point of View'') that, compared with Knopfelmacher's opponents, "[[Pontius Pilate]] was an amateur!". {{cn|date=May 2013}}

During the late 1960s Knopfelmacher (still lecturing at Melbourne University) became de facto academic leader of those, usually associated with the Santamaria-controlled Peace With Freedom group, who favoured continuing Australian military involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. He became a strong proponent of controversial drive for [[Conscription in Australia|Australian conscription]] and the method of conscription by lottery.  

When, in 1972, Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War ended (with the election of the [[Whitlam government]]), Knopfelmacher's long-standing intellectual unpredictability became more pronounced. He turned vehemently against Santamaria. In ''[[The Age]]'' on 7 April 1984, he likened Santamaria's treatment of trade-union opponents to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s treatment of [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]. The previous year (''Quadrant'', October 1983), he had directed some of his most sarcastic prose against Santamaria's supporters among conservative Catholic activists.

His self-contradictions end there. In 1977, he had proclaimed, in an article in the shortlived Sydney magazine ''[[Nation Review]]'', that "Australia is a deeply racist nation" and lauded [[Indochina refugee crisis|Indochinese refugee]] arrivals, viewing their acceptance by the immigration authorities as a debt of honour that Australia owed to its defeated allies. Within five years he executed a complete ''volte-face'' in condemning [[multiculturalism]] in sharp terms and calling it an "ethnic cauldron" (''The Bulletin'', 24 March 1981) and "a banana republic of squabbling and mutually resentful expatriated mini-cultures, each with its own special bunch of ethnic ... führers" ([[Robert Manne]] [ed.], ''The New Conservatism in Australia'', St Lucia, Queensland, 1982). From 1979, he denounced (notably in letters to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' magazine) John Bennett, the secretary of the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties, for disseminating [[Holocaust denial]] literature.  Yet by 1989 he was arguing vituperatively with Jews who publicly advocated a national war crimes statute&lt;ref&gt;See [[W. D. Rubinstein]], ''The Jews in Australia'' [Melbourne, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;. A further issue which divided him from other [[Australian Jews]] was multiculturalism, which he described as being a racket, an industry scrambling for government grants&lt;ref&gt;Norman Abjorensen, (1995), A key figure in a puzzling era, [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/130551744 ''The Canberra Times'', 19 May 1995, p.13.] Accessed 16 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

For all his admiration of Koestler and [[George Orwell]], Knopfelmacher wrote far less than either man, and his hardcover bibliography amounted to one 1968 reflection, ''Intellectuals and Politics''. (A promised full-length memoir remains in manuscript, but a brief account of his political education appeared in the 1981 anthology ''Twenty-Five Years of 'Quadrant'''.) His protracted, usually free-wheeling, invariably slanderous late-night telephone monologues, visited alike upon associates and, more often antagonists, retained a mythic status for decades among Australian intellectuals, not least for their superabundant four-letter words, which evoked the heyday of [[Kenneth Tynan]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]'s [[Free Speech Movement|Filthy Speech Movement]]. (The monologues, if attempted today, would now be actionable under [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'s anti-[[stalking]] laws.)

Having in his old age revived his long-defunct friendship with Santamaria, who, from the early 1990s, deliberately sought reconciliations with ex-Cabinet Minister [[Clyde Cameron]] and other erstwhile foes{{cn|date=March 2018}}, Knopfelmacher died after incurring severe injuries in a road accident following a meeting with [[Václav Havel]]. Obituarists likened him to [[Primo Levi]] and to [[Samuel Johnson]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

His first wife, fellow refugee Jarmila "Jacka" Pick, whom he had married in 1944, succumbed in 1968 to an especially cruel and protracted form of [[multiple sclerosis]]. In 1970, Knopfelmacher wed Australian teacher Susan Robinson; the couple had two children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5140">'''Frederick G. Lawrence''' is an American hermeneutic philosopher and theologian, and a specialist in [[Bernard Lonergan]], teaching in the Department of Theology at [[Boston College]], Boston, USA.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Madigan, “Catholic Philosophers in the U.S.,” ''The Sheed &amp; Ward Anthology of Catholic Philosophy'', ed.

== Life ==
Fred Lawrence (as he is popularly known) is married to Sue Lawrence. He has been running the annual Lonergan Workshop at [[Boston College]] for many years, and is editor of ''Lonergan Workshop'', which publishes the proceedings. He also convened the First and Second International Lonergan Conferences at Rome (2001) and Toronto (2004).

He was a student of Bernard Lonergan at the [[Gregorian University]], Rome, and is today one of the foremost interpreters of Lonergan's thought and an acknowledged hermeneutical philosopher in his own right.

He did his PhD on the 'unlikely topic' of the hermeneutical circle in the thought of [[Gadamer]] and Lonergan. The thesis had the unique distinction of being appreciated by both thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;B. Lonergan, "A Requested Review of the Writings of Frederick Lawrence," ''Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education'' 19/1-2 (2008) 269-282.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, it has still to be published, though a copy is available at the Lonergan Centre, Boston College, and in microfilm.

He was a personal friend of both Gadamer and Lonergan, and upon his invitation, Gadamer came several semesters to Boston College.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the papers published in ''The Beginning and the Beyond. Papers from the Gadamer and Voegelin Conferences,'' Supplementary Issue of ''Lonergan Workshop'' 4: v-vi, ed. Fred Lawrence (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
In 2007, 6–8 September, a conference on "Hermeneutics, Postmodernism, Relativism" was held in honour of Fred Lawrence at [[Divyadaan: Salesian Institute of Philosophy, Nashik|Divyadaan: Salesian Institute of Philosophy]], Nashik, India. Lawrence was scheduled to participate, but in the end could not for reasons of health; he, however, did contribute four papers outlining the contributions of [[Heidegger]], [[Gadamer]] and Lonergan to the twentieth century hermeneutic revolution. The papers were published by [[Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education'' 19/1-2 (2008): Hermeneutics, Postmodernism, Relativism: Conference in Honour of Fred Lawrence, Divyadaan, Nashik - India, 6–8 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerd Gigerenzer''' (born September 3, 1947, [[Wallersdorf]], [[Germany]]) is a [[Germany|German]] [[psychologist]] who has studied the use of [[bounded rationality]] and [[heuristic]]s in [[decision making]]. Gigerenzer is director emeritus of the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) at the [[Max Planck Institute for Human Development]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/staff/gerd-gigerenzer Gerd Gigerenzer | Max Planck Institute for Human Development]&lt;/ref&gt; and director of the Harding Center for Risk Literacy,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.harding-center.mpg.de/en/team Harding Center for Risk Literacy (Team)&lt;/ref&gt; both in Berlin, Germany.

Gigerenzer investigates how humans make inferences about their world with limited time and knowledge. He proposes that, in an uncertain world, probability theory is not sufficient; people also use smart heuristics, that is, rules of thumb. He conceptualizes rational decisions in terms of the ''adaptive toolbox'' (the repertoire of heuristics an individual or institution has) and the ability to choose a good heuristics for the task at hand. A heuristic is called [[Ecological rationality|ecologically rational]] to the degree that it is adapted to the structure of an environment.

Gigerenzer argues that heuristics are not irrational or always second-best to optimization, as the accuracy-effort trade-off view assumes, in which heuristics are seen as short-cuts that trade less effort for less accuracy. In contrast, his and associated researchers' studies have identified situations in which "less is more", that is, where heuristics make more accurate decisions with less effort. This contradicts the traditional view that more information is always better or at least can never hurt if it is free. Less-is-more effects have been shown experimentally, analytically, and by computer simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gigerenzer|first=Gerd|date=2008|title=Why Heuristics Work|url=|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=3 | issue = 1 |pages=20–29|via=Sage Journals|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2008.00058.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Academic career===
Gigerenzer received his PhD from the [[University of Munich]] in 1977 and became a professor of psychology there the same year. In 1984 he moved to the [[University of Konstanz]] and in 1990 to the [[University of Salzburg]]. From 1992 to 1995 he was Professor of Psychology at the [[University of Chicago]] and has been the John M. Olin Distinguished Visiting Professor, School of Law at the [[University of Virginia]]. In 1995 he became director of the Max Planck Institute for Psychological Research in Munich. Since 2008 he has been at the Harding Center for Risk Literacy in Berlin.

He is also Batten Fellow at the Darden Business School, University of Virginia, and Fellow of the [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences]] and the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].

===Heuristics===
With [[Daniel Goldstein]] he first theorized the [[recognition heuristic]] and the [[take-the-best heuristic]]. They proved analytically conditions under which semi-ignorance (lack of recognition) can lead to better inferences than with more knowledge. These results were experimentally confirmed in many experiments, e.g., by showing that semi-ignorant people who rely on recognition are as good as or better than the ATP Rankings and experts at predicting the outcomes of the Wimbledon tennis tournaments. Similarly, decisions by experienced experts (e.g., police, professional burglars, airport security) were found to follow the take-the-best heuristic rather than weight and add all information, while inexperienced students tend to do the latter. A third class of heuristics, [[Fast-And-Frugal trees]], are designed for categorization and are used for instance in emergency units to predict heart attacks, and model bail decisions made by magistrates in London courts. In such cases, the risks are not knowable and professionals hence face uncertainty. To better understand the logic of [[Fast-And-Frugal trees]] and other heuristics, Gigerenzer and his colleagues use the strategy of mapping its concepts onto those of well-understood optimization theories, such as [[signal-detection theory]].

A critic of the work of [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]], Gigerenzer argues that heuristics should not lead us to conceive of human thinking as riddled with irrational cognitive biases, but rather to conceive rationality as an adaptive tool that is not identical to the rules of formal logic or the probability calculus. He and his collaborators have theoretically and experimentally shown that many so-called cognitive fallacies are better understood as adaptive responses to a world of uncertainty—such as the [[conjunction fallacy]], the [[base rate fallacy]], and [[overconfidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gigerenzer | first1 = G | year = 1991 | title = How to make cognitive illusions disappear: Beyond "heuristics and biases" | url = | journal = European review of social psychology | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 83–115 | doi=10.1080/14792779143000033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The adaptive toolbox===
The basic idea of the adaptive toolbox is that different domains of thought require different specialized cognitive mechanisms instead of one universal strategy. The analysis of the adaptive toolbox and its evolution is descriptive research with the goal of specifying the core cognitive capacities (such as [[recognition memory]]) and the heuristics that exploit these (such as the [[recognition heuristic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gigerenzer and Selten: ''Bounded Rationality: The Adaptive Toolbox.'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk communication===
Alongside his research on heuristics, Gigerenzer investigates risk communication in situations where risks can actually be calculated or precisely estimated. He has developed an ecological approach to risk communication where the key is the match between cognition and the presentation of the information in the environment. For instance, lay people as well as professionals often have problems making [[Bayesian inference]]s, typically committing what has been called the base-rate fallacy in the cognitive illusions literature. Gigerenzer and Ulrich Hoffrage were the first to develop and test a representation called ''natural frequencies'', which helps people make Bayesian inferences correctly without any outside help. Later it was shown that with this method, even 4th graders were able to make correct inferences. Once again, the problem is not simply in the human mind, but in the representation of the information. Gigerenzer has taught risk literacy to some 1,000 doctors in their CMU and some 50 US federal judges, and ''natural frequencies'' has now entered the vocabulary of evidence-based medicine. In recent years, medical schools around the world have begun to teach tools such as natural frequencies to help young doctors understand test results.

==Intellectual background==
Intellectually, Gigerenzer's work is rooted in [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]]'s work on satisficing (as opposed to maximizing) and on ecological and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] views of cognition, where adaptive function and success is central, as opposed to logical structure and consistency, although the latter can be means towards function.

Gigerenzer and colleagues write of the mid-17th century "probabilistic revolution", "the demise of the dream of certainty and the rise of a calculus of uncertainty – probability theory".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todd|first=Peter M.|last2=Gigerenzer|first2=Gerd|date=2000|title=Précis of ''Simple heuristics that make us smart''|url=http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~mckenzie/ToddGigerenzer2000BBS.pdf|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=23|pages=727–741|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00003447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gigerenzer calls for a second revolution, "replacing the image of an omniscient mind computing intricate probabilities and utilities with that of a bounded mind reaching into an adaptive toolbox filled with fast and frugal heuristics".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These heuristics would equip humans to deal more specifically with the many situations they face in which not all alternatives and probabilities are known, and surprises can happen.

==Personal==
Gigerenzer is a jazz and Dixieland musician. He was part of The Munich Beefeaters Dixieland Band which performed in a TV ad for the [[VW Golf]] around the time it came out in 1974. The ad can be viewed on YouTube,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Pxss-xGI0rw|Original TV ad for VW Golf with The Munich Beefeaters Dixieland Band}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Gigerenzer at the steering wheel and on the banjo.

He is married to [[Lorraine Daston]], director at the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]] and has one daughter, Thalia Gigerenzer.

==Awards==
Gigerenzer is recipient of the [[AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.aaas.org/awards.php?a_id=24 History &amp; Archives:  AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research]&lt;/ref&gt; for the best article in the behavioral sciences, the Association of American Publishers Prize for the best book in the social and behavioral sciences, the German Psychology Prize,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutscher-psychologie-preis.de/presse/deutscher-psychologie-preis-2011-an-prof-dr-gerd-gigerenzer.html Pressemitteilung Deutscher Psychologie Preis 2011 an Prof. Dr. Gerd Gigerenzer]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Communicator Award of the German Research Association (DFG),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfg.de/en/service/press/press_releases/2011/press_release_no_16/ Press Release: Communicator Award 2011 Goes to Gerd Gigerenzer ]&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11767">'''Giles of Rome''' ([[Latin]]: ''Aegidius Romanus''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Egidio Colonna''; c. 1243 &amp;ndash; 22 December 1316), was an  [[archbishop of Bourges]] who was famed for his [[logician]] commentary on the ''[[Organon]]'' by [[Aristotle]]. Giles was [[style (address)|style]]d '''Doctor Fundatissimus''' ("Best-Grounded Teacher") by [[Pope Benedict XIV]]. He was Prior General of the [[Augustinian]] order, and also authored two other important works, ''De Ecclesiastica Potestate'', a major text of early 14th century [[papalism]], and ''De Regimine Principum'', a guide book for princes.

Writers in 14th and 15th century England such as [[John Trevisa]] and [[Thomas Hoccleve]] translated or adapted him into English.

==Early life==
Very little in known about his early life, although [[Jordan of Saxony]] claimed in his late 13th century work ''Liber Vitasfratrum'' that Giles belonged to the Colonna family of [[Rome]]. But Jordan of Saxony was not a contemporary of Giles, and many scholars remain skeptical of his account of Giles' early life.  Having entered the [[Order of the Hermits of St. Augustine]] at Rome, he was sent to Paris for his philosophical and theological studies, and became there the disciple of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. He was the first Augustinian appointed to teach in the [[University of Paris]].

It is likely that Giles was a student of Thomas Aquinas during the period between 1269 and 1272. He began many of his commentaries on the works of Aristotle during the 1270s. Giles was in Paris doing theology until Bishop [[Étienne Tempier]] condemned the Aristotelian school of thought, including those who wrote commentaries on Aristotle's work, in the [[Condemnation of 1277]]. Giles, whose work had been condemned, disappeared from the Paris academic scene. There is no information on Giles between the period of 1277 and 1281, when he returned to Italy. However, in 1281, at the Thirty-sixth Council of Paris, in which several differences between bishops and [[mendicant order]]s were arranged, he sided with the bishops against the regulars. Referring to this, a contemporary philosopher, [[Godfrey of Fontaines]] mentioned him as the most renowned theologian of the whole city (''qui modo melior de totâ villâ in omnibus reputatur''), suggesting he might have been in Paris during this period before going back to Rome.

[[Philip III of France]] entrusted to him the education of his son, who later, in 1285, ascended the throne as [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]]. When the new king, after his consecration at [[Reims]], entered Paris, Giles gave the address of welcome in the name of the university, insisting on justice as the most important virtue of a king. (For the text, see Ossinger, in work cited below.)

In 1285 Giles' work was again called into question, but by 1287 he was allowed to continue teaching. Eight years later in 1295 Giles was appointed as the archbishop of Bourges, which he wrote about in his work ''De renunciatione''.

==Controversy==
Giles was involved in the [[Condemnations_of_1210–1277#Condemnation_of_1277|condemnation of 1277]] promulgated by [[Étienne Tempier]]. Several of his opinions had been found reprehensible by Archbishop Tempier, and in 1285 Pope [[Honorius IV]] asked him for a public retraction. This, however, was far from lessening his reputation, for in 1287 a decree of the general chapter of the Augustinians held in Florence, after remarking that Giles's doctrine "shines throughout the whole world" (''venerabilis magistri nostri Ægidii doctrina mundum universum illustrat''), commanded all members of the order to accept and defend all his opinions, written or to be written.

After filling several important positions in his order he was elected [[superior-general]] in 1292. Three years later [[Pope Boniface VIII]] appointed him Archbishop of Bourges, France, although [[Jean de Savigny]] had already been designated for this [[episcopal see|see]] by [[Pope Celestine V]]. The French nobility protested on the ground that Colonna was an Italian, but his appointment was maintained and approved by the king.

He was present at the [[Council of Vienne]] (1311–1312) in which the [[Knights Templar|Order of Knights Templars]] was suppressed. He died in [[Avignon]].

==Works==
[[File:Egidio - In secundum librum sententiarum quaestiones, 1581 - 4373725 BEIC3 V00027-1 F0005.tif|thumb|''In secundum librum sententiarum quaestiones'', 1581]]
{{Catholic philosophy}}
His writings cover the fields of philosophy and theology. There is no complete edition of his works, but several treatises have been published separately.

In Holy Scripture and theology he wrote commentaries on the ''Hexaemeron'', the ''Canticle of Canticles'', and the ''[[Epistle to the Romans]]''; several ''Opuscula'' and ''Quodlibeta,'' various treatises, and especially commentaries on [[Peter the Lombard]]'s ''Four Books of Sentences.''

In philosophy, besides commentaries on almost all the works of [[Aristotle]], he wrote several special treatises. But his main work is the treatise ''De regimine principum,'' written for, and dedicated to, his pupil, Philip IV. It passed through many editions (the first, Augsburg, 1473) and was translated into several languages. The Roman edition of 1607 contains a life of Egidio. The work is divided into three books: the first treats of the individual conduct of the king, the nature of his true happiness, the choice and acquisition of virtues, and the ruling of passions; the second deals with family life and the relations with wife, children, and servants; the third considers the State, its origin, and the proper mode of governing in times of peace and war.

His pedagogical writings have been published in German by Kaufmann (Freiburg, 1904).

His attitude in the difficulties between Pope Boniface VIII and King Philip IV was long believed to have been favourable to the king. But it has been proved that he is the author of the treatise ''De potestate ecclesiasticâ,'' in which the rights of the pope are vindicated. The similarity between this treatise and the [[papal bull|bull]] ''[[Unam Sanctam]]'' seems to support the view taken by some writers that he was the author of the bull.

He had already taken an active part in ending the discussions and controversies concerning the validity of Boniface's election to the papacy. In his treatise ''De renunciatione Papæ sive Apologia pro Bonifacio VIII'' he shows the legitimacy of Celestine's resignation and consequently of Boniface's election. In philosophy and theology he generally follows the opinions of his master, St. Thomas, whose works he quotes as ''scripta communia.''

The ''Defensorium seu Correctorium corruptorii librorum Sancti Thomæ Acquinatis'' against the Franciscan [[William de la Mare]] of [[Oxford]] is by some attributed to him; but this remains uncertain. Nevertheless, on many points he holds independent views and abandons the Thomistic doctrine to follow the opinions of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and of the Franciscan School. He even errs in asserting that, before [[Fall of Man|the Fall]], [[Actual grace|grace]] had not been given to [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], an opinion which he wrongly attributes to St. Augustine.

Giles wrote a commentary on [[Guido Cavalcanti]]'s philosophical love ''[[canzone]]'' "Donna me prega" (see Enrico Fenzi, ''La canzone d'amore di Guido Cavalcanti e i suoi antichi commenti'', Melangolo, 1999).

==The Aegidian school==
After the decree of the general chapter of 1287, mentioned above, his opinions  were generally accepted in the Augustinian Order. He thus became the founder of the Ægidian School. Among the most prominent representatives of this school must be mentioned [[Giacomo Capoccio of Viterbo]] (d. 1307) and [[Augustinus Triumphus]] (d. 1328), both of them his contemporaries, and also students and professors in the University of Paris: [[Prosper of Reggio]], [[Albert of Padua]], [[Gerard of Siena]], [[Henry of Frimar]], [[Thomas of Strasburg]] &amp;mdash; all in the first half of the fourteenth century.

For some time after this other opinions prevailed in the Augustinian Order. But as late as the seventeenth century should be mentioned [[Raffaello Bonherba]] (d. 1681) who wrote ''Disputationes totius philosophiæ … in quibus omnes philosophicæ inter D. Thomam et Scotum controversiæ principaliter cum doctrinâ nostri Ægidii Columnæ illustrantur'' (Palermo, 1645, 1671); and [[Augustino Arpe]] (d. 1704) who wrote ''Summa totius theologiæ Ægidii Columnæ'' (Bologna, 1701, and Genoa, 1704).

[[Federico Nicolò Gavardi]] (d. 1715), the most important interpreter of Colonna, composed ''Theologia exantiquata iuxta orthodoxam S. P. Augustini doctrinam ab Ægidio Columnâ doctoræ fundatissimo expositam …'' (6 vols. fol., Naples and Rome, 1683–1696); this work was abridged by [[Anselm Hörmannseder]] in his ''Hecatombe theologica'' (Presburg, 1737). [[Benignus Sichrowsky]] (d. 1737) wrote also ''Philosophia vindicata ad erroribus philosophorum gentilium iuxta doctrinam S. Augustini et B. Ægidii Columnæ'' (Nuremberg, 1701).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3956">'''Helene von Druskowitz''' (May 2, 1856 &amp;ndash; May 31, 1918), born '''Helena Maria Druschkovich''', was an Austrian philosopher, writer and music critic. She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in [[Zürich]]. She usually published under a male alias because of predominant [[sexism]].

== Biography ==
Druskowitz was born at [[Hietzing]], in [[Vienna]]. In 1874 she moved to Zürich and completed her ''[[abitur]]'' in 1878. After studying philosophy, archeology, German literature, [[Orientalism]] and modern languages, she became the first Austrian woman and the second after [[Stefania Wolicka]] to obtain a doctorate in philosophy, with a dissertation on [[Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]''. She then worked as a literary history teacher in different universities (Vienna, Zurich, Munich, Basel). She also traveled to North Africa, France, Italy and Spain before returning to Vienna. In 1881 she met [[Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach]] who introduced her to her literary circle. Three years later, she became acquainted with [[Lou Andreas Salomé]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], whom she was introduced to by the circle of [[Malwida von Meysenbug]]. Helene Druskowitz was one of the happy few who received a copy of the fourth book of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', published at the author's expense. However, the relationship with Nietzsche did not last long.

In 1885 she published a book on ''Three English Writers'', [[Joanna Baillie]], [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] and [[George Eliot]].

Helene Druskowitz's brother died in 1886, and her mother in 1888. In 1887, she began a live-in relationship in Dresden with the opera singer [[Therese Malten]].&lt;ref&gt;Who's ''Who in Gay and Lesbian History'' edited by Robert Aldrich and Garry Wotherspoon; Routledge, London (2202)&lt;/ref&gt; She started to drink excessively and also had some drug problems. After a romantic separation in 1891, she finally slipped into alcoholism, and was sent in 1891 to a [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Dresden]]. However, Helene continued to write and publish until 1905. She helped found the feminist reviews ''[[Der heilige Kampf]]'' (''The Holy Struggle'') and ''[[Der Federuf]]'' (''The Call to Feud''). Druskowitz criticized both religion, sexism and, after her break with Nietzsche, [[Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy|his philosophy]].

She died at the end of May 1918 in [[Mauer-Öhling]], of [[dysentery]], having spent the last 27 years of her life in a psychiatric institution.

'''Henri-Louis Bergson''' ({{IPA-fr|bɛʁksɔn|lang}}; 18 October 1859 – 4 January 1941) was a [[French philosophy|French]]-[[Jews|Jewish]] philosopher who was influential in the tradition of [[continental philosophy]], especially during the first half of the 20th century until [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Merquior, J.G. (1987). Foucault (Fontana Modern Masters series), University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-06062-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergson is known for his arguments that processes of [[immediate experience]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] are more significant than abstract [[rationalism]] and science for understanding reality.

He was awarded the 1927 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "in recognition of his rich and vitalizing ideas and the brilliant skill with which they have been presented".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1927/|title=The Nobel prize in Literature|accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 France awarded him its highest honour, the [[Grand-Croix de la Legion d'honneur]].

Bergson's great popularity created a controversy in France where his views were seen as opposing the secular and scientific attitude  adopted by the Republic's officials.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C.

==Biography==

=== Overview ===
Bergson was born in the Rue Lamartine in Paris, not far from the [[Palais Garnier]] (the old Paris opera house) in 1859. His father, the pianist [[Michał Bergson]], was of a [[Polish Jewish]] background (originally bearing the name Bereksohn). His great-grandmother, [[Temerl Bergson]], was a well-known patroness and benefactor of Polish Jewry, especially those associated with the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2587502673.html|title=Bergson|first= Nathan Michael |last=Gelber |work=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|date=1 January 2007|accessdate=7 December 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVtp3s8CtScC&amp;pg=PA102 |title=Men of Silk: The Hasidic Conquest of Polish Jewish Society|first=Glenn|last=Dynner|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019538265X|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Katherine Levison, daughter of a Yorkshire doctor, was from an [[History of the Jews in England|English]] and [[History of the Jews in Ireland|Irish]] Jewish background.

King of Poland from 1764 to 1795.

Henri Bergson's family lived in London for a few years after his birth, and he obtained an early familiarity with the English language from his mother. Before he was nine, his parents settled in France, Henri becoming a naturalized French citizen.

Henri Bergson married Louise Neuberger, a cousin of [[Marcel Proust]] (1871–1922), in 1891. (The novelist served as [[groomsman#best man|best man]] at Bergson's wedding.)&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Guerlac, ''Thinking in Time: An Introduction to Henri Bergson'', Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2007, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Henri and Louise Bergson had a daughter, Jeanne, born deaf in 1896. Bergson's sister, Mina Bergson (also known as [[Moina Mathers]]), married the English [[occult]] author [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]], a founder of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], and the couple later relocated to Paris as well.

Bergson lived the quiet life of a French professor, marked by the publication of his four principal works:

# in 1889, ''[[Time and Free Will]]'' (''Essai sur les données immédiates de la conscience'')
# in 1896, ''[[Matter and Memory]]'' (''Matière et mémoire'')
# in 1907, ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' (''L'Évolution créatrice'')
# in 1932, ''The Two Sources of Morality and Religion'' (''Les deux sources de la morale et de la religion'')

In 1900 the [[College of France]] selected Bergson to a Chair of Greek and Roman Philosophy, which he held until 1904. He then replaced [[Gabriel Tarde]] in the Chair of Modern Philosophy, which he held until 1920. The public attended his open courses in large numbers.

Bergson attended the Lycée Fontanes (known as the [[Lycée Condorcet]] 1870–1874 and 1883–present) in Paris from 1868 to 1878.

Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2016/entries/bergson/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Between 14 and 16, however, he lost his faith. According to Hude (1990), this moral crisis is tied to his discovery of the theory of [[evolution]], according to which humanity shares common ancestry with modern primates, a process sometimes construed as not needing a creative deity.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Hude, ''Bergson'', Paris, Editions Universitaires, 1990, 2 volumes, quoted by Anne Fagot-Largeau in her [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/cours_3.jsp 21 December 2006 course] at the College of France&lt;/ref&gt;

While at the lycée Bergson won a prize for his scientific work and another, in 1877 when he was eighteen, for the solution of a mathematical problem. His solution was published the following year in ''[[Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques |series=2 |number=17 |year=1878 |page=268 |location=Paris |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3c_AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA268 |access-date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his first published work. After some hesitation as to whether his career should lie in the sphere of the sciences or that of the [[humanities]], he decided in favour of the latter, to the dismay of his teachers.&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau&gt;[[Anne Fagot-Largeau]], [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm 21 December 2006 course] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206183341/http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm |date=6 February 2009 }} at the [[College of France]] (audio file of the course)&lt;/ref&gt; When he was nineteen, he entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. During this period, he read [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; He obtained there the degree of ''[[licence ès lettres]]'', and this was followed by that of ''[[Agrégation|agrégation de philosophie]]'' in 1881 from the [[University of Paris]].

The same year he received a teaching appointment at the [[lycée]] in [[Angers]], the ancient capital of [[Anjou]]. Two years later he settled at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Blaise-Pascal (Clermont-Ferrand)|fr}} in [[Clermont-Ferrand]], capital of the [[Puy-de-Dôme]] [[département]].

The year after his arrival at Clermont-Ferrand Bergson displayed his ability in the humanities by the publication of an edition of extracts from [[Lucretius]], with a critical study of the text and of the [[materialism|materialist]] [[cosmology]] of the poet (1884), a work whose repeated editions{{Which|date=November 2009}} attest to its value in promoting Classics among French youth. While teaching and lecturing in this part of his country (the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] region), Bergson found time for private study and original work. He crafted his dissertation ''Time and Free Will'', which was submitted, along with a short [[Latin]] thesis on [[Aristotle]] (''Quid Aristoteles de loco senserit'', "On the Concept of Place in Aristotle"), for his doctoral degree which was awarded by the [[University of Paris]] in 1889. The work was published in the same year by [[Félix Alcan]]. He also gave courses in Clermont-Ferrand on the [[Pre-Socratic Philosophy|Pre-Socratics]], in particular on [[Heraclitus]].&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt;

Bergson dedicated ''Time and Free Will'' to {{ill|Jules Lachelier|fr}} (1832–1918), then [[Minister of National Education (France)|public education minister]], a disciple of [[Félix Ravaisson]] (1813–1900) and the author of a philosophical work ''On the Founding of [[inductive reasoning|Induction]]'' (''Du fondement de l'induction'', 1871). Lachelier endeavoured "to substitute everywhere force for inertia, life for death, and liberty for fatalism". (Bergson owed much to both of these teachers of the ''École Normale Supérieure''. Compare his memorial address on Ravaisson, who died in 1900.)

Bergson settled again in Paris in 1888,&lt;ref&gt;''Henri Bergson: Key Writings'', ed. Keith Ansell Pearson and John Mullarkey. London: Continuum, 2002, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; and after teaching for some months at the [[municipal college]], known as the ''College Rollin'', he received an appointment at the [[Lycée Henri-Quatre]], where he remained for eight years. There, he read [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and gave a course on his theories.&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; Although Bergson had previously endorsed [[Lamarckism]] and its theory of the [[inheritance of acquired characters|heritability of acquired characteristics]], he came to prefer Darwin's hypothesis of gradual variations, which were more compatible with his continual vision of life.&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt;

In 1896 he published his second major work, entitled ''Matter and Memory''. This rather difficult work investigates the function of the brain and undertakes an analysis of [[perception]] and [[memory]], leading up to a careful consideration of the problems of the relation of body and mind. Bergson had spent years of research in preparation for each of his three large works. This is especially obvious in ''Matter and Memory'', where he showed a thorough acquaintance with the extensive pathological investigations which had been carried out during the period.

In 1898 Bergson became ''[[maître de conférences]]'' at his alma mater, École Normale Supérieure, and later in the same year received a promotion to a Professorship. The year 1900 saw him installed as Professor at the [[Collège de France]], where he accepted the Chair of [[Greek philosophy|Greek and Roman Philosophy]] in succession to {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles Lévêque|fr}}.

At the first [[International Congress of Philosophy]], held in Paris during the first five days of August 1900, Bergson read a short, but important, paper, "Psychological Origins of the Belief in the Law of Causality" (''Sur les origines psychologiques de notre croyance à la loi de causalité''). In 1900 [[Felix Alcan]] published a work which had previously appeared in the ''[[Revue de Paris]]'', entitled ''[[Laughter (book)|Laughter]]'' (''Le rire''), one of the most important of Bergson's minor productions. This essay on the meaning of comedy stemmed from a lecture which he had given in his early days in the Auvergne. The study of it is essential to an understanding of Bergson's views of life, and its passages dealing with the place of the artistic in life are valuable. The main thesis of the work is that [[laughter]] is a corrective evolved to make social life possible for human beings. We laugh at people who fail to adapt to the demands of society if it seems their failure is akin to an inflexible mechanism. Comic authors have exploited this human tendency to laugh in various ways, and what is common to them is the idea that the comic consists in there being "something mechanical encrusted on the living".&lt;ref&gt;p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seth Benedict Graham ''[http://etd.library.pitt.edu/ETD/available/etd-11032003-192424/unrestricted/grahamsethb_etd2003.pdf A CULTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE RUSSO-SOVIET ANEKDOT]'', 2003, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 the [[Académie des sciences morales et politiques]] elected Bergson as a member, and he became a member of the Institute. In 1903 he contributed to the ''[[Revue de métaphysique et de morale]]'' a very important essay entitled ''[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Bergson)|Introduction to Metaphysics]]'' (''Introduction à la metaphysique''), which is useful as a preface to the study of his three large books. He detailed in this essay his philosophical program, realized in the ''Creative Evolution''.&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt;

On the death of [[Gabriel Tarde]], the sociologist and philosopher, in 1904, Bergson succeeded him in the Chair of Modern Philosophy. From 4 to 8 September of that year he visited [[Geneva]], attending the Second International Congress of Philosophy, when he lectured on ''The Mind and Thought: A Philosophical Illusion'' (Le cerveau et la pensée: une illusion philosophique). An illness prevented his visiting Germany from attending the Third Congress held at [[Heidelberg]].

His third major work, ''Creative Evolution'', the most widely known and most discussed of his books, appeared in 1907. Pierre Imbart de la Tour remarked that ''Creative Evolution'' was a milestone of new direction in thought.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} By 1918, [[Alcan]], the publisher, had issued twenty-one editions, making an average of two editions ''per annum'' for ten years. Following the appearance of this book, Bergson's popularity increased enormously, not only in academic circles but among the general reading public.

At that time, Bergson had already made an extensive study of [[biology]] including the theory of [[fecundation]] (as shown in the first chapter of the ''Creative Evolution''), which had only recently emerged, ca. 1885 – no small feat for a philosopher specializing in the [[history of philosophy]], in particular Greek and Roman philosophy.&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; He also most certainly had read, apart from Darwin, [[Haeckel]], from whom he retained his idea of a unity of life and of the ecological solidarity between all living beings,&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; as well as [[Hugo de Vries]], from whom he quoted his [[mutation theory]] of evolution (which he opposed, preferring Darwin's gradualism).&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; He also quoted [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]], the successor of [[Claude Bernard]] at the Chair of Experimental Medicine in the Collège de France, etc.

Bergson served as a juror with [[Florence Meyer Blumenthal]] in awarding the [[Prix Blumenthal]], a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"&gt;{{Cite web

===Relationship with James and pragmatism===
Bergson traveled to London in 1908 and met there with [[William James]], the [[Harvard]] philosopher who was Bergson's senior by seventeen years, and who was instrumental in calling the attention of the Anglo-American public to the work of the French professor. The two became great friends. James's impression of Bergson is given in his Letters under date of 4 October 1908:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So modest and unpretending a man but such a genius intellectually! I have the strongest suspicions that the tendency which he has brought to a focus, will end by prevailing, and that the present epoch will be a sort of turning point in the history of philosophy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As early as 1880, James had contributed an article in French to the periodical ''La Critique philosophique'', of Renouvier and Pillon, entitled ''[[Le Sentiment de l'Effort]]''. Four years later, a couple of articles by him appeared in the journal ''Mind'': "What is an Emotion?" and "On some Omissions of Introspective Psychology". Bergson quoted the first two of these articles in his 1889 work, ''Time and Free Will''. In the following years, 1890–91 appeared the two volumes of James's monumental work, ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', in which he refers to a pathological phenomenon observed by Bergson. Some writers, taking merely these dates into consideration and overlooking the fact that James's investigations had been proceeding since 1870 (registered from time to time by various articles which culminated in "The Principles"), have mistakenly dated Bergson's ideas as earlier than James's.

It has been suggested{{By whom|date=September 2009}} that Bergson owes the root ideas of his first book to the 1884 article by James, "On Some Omissions of Introspective Psychology," which he neither refers to nor quotes. This article deals with the conception of thought as a [[stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], which [[intellect]] distorts by framing into concepts. Bergson replied to this insinuation by denying that he had any knowledge of the article by James when he wrote ''Les données immédiates de la conscience''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The two thinkers appear to have developed independently until almost the close of the century. They are further apart in their intellectual position than is frequently supposed. Both have succeeded in appealing to audiences far beyond the purely academic sphere, but only in their mutual rejection of "intellectualism" as decisive as their actual agreement. Although James was slightly ahead in the development and enunciation of his ideas, he confessed that he was baffled by many of Bergson's notions. James certainly neglected many of the deeper metaphysical aspects of Bergson's thought, which did not harmonize with his own, and are even in direct contradiction. In addition to this, Bergson can hardly be considered a pragmatist. For him, "utility," far from being a test of truth, was, in fact, the reverse: a synonym for error.

Nevertheless, William James hailed Bergson as an ally. In 1903, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been re-reading Bergson's books, and nothing that I have read for years has so excited and stimulated my thoughts. I am sure that his philosophy has a great future; it breaks through old frameworks and brings things to a solution from which new crystallizations can be reached.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ibiblio.org/HTMLTexts/John_Alexander_Gunn/Bergson_And_His_Philosophy/chapter1.html Bergson and his philosophy] Chapter 1: Life of Bergson
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most noteworthy tributes James paid to Bergson come in the [[Hibbert Lectures]] (A Pluralistic Universe), which James gave at [[Manchester College, Oxford]], shortly after meeting Bergson in London. He remarks on the encouragement he gained from Bergson's thought, and refers to his confidence in being "able to lean on Bergson's authority." (See further James's reservations about Bergson, below.)

The influence of Bergson had led James "to renounce the intellectualist method and the current notion that [[logic]] is an adequate measure of what can or cannot be". It had induced him, he continued, "to give up logic, squarely and irrevocably" as a method, for he found that "reality, life, experience, concreteness, immediacy, use what word you will, exceeds our logic, overflows, and surrounds it".

These remarks, which appeared in James's book ''A Pluralistic Universe'' in 1909, impelled many English and American readers to investigate Bergson's philosophy for themselves, but no English translations of Bergson's major work had yet appeared. James, however, encouraged and assisted Dr. [[Arthur Mitchell (physician)|Arthur Mitchell]] in preparing an English translation of ''Creative Evolution''. In August 1910, James died. It was his intention, had he lived to see the translation finished, to introduce it to the English reading public by a prefatory note of appreciation. In the following year, the translation was completed and still greater interest in Bergson and his work was the result. By coincidence, in that same year (1911), Bergson penned a preface of sixteen pages entitled ''Truth and Reality'' for the French translation of James's book, ''Pragmatism''. In it, he expressed sympathetic appreciation of James's work, together with certain important reservations.

From 5 to 11 April, Bergson attended the Fourth International Congress of Philosophy held at [[Bologna]], in Italy, where he gave an address on "Philosophical Intuition". In response to invitations he visited England in May of that year, and on several subsequent occasions. These visits were well received.{{By whom|date=September 2009}} His speeches offered new perspectives{{Which|date=November 2009}} and elucidated many passages in his three major works: ''Time and Free Will'', ''Matter and Memory'', and ''Creative Evolution''. Although necessarily brief statements, they developed and enriched the ideas in his books and clarified for English audiences the fundamental principles of his philosophy.

===Lectures on change===
In May 1911 Bergson gave two lectures entitled ''The Perception of Change'' (''La perception du changement'') at the [[University of Oxford]]. The [[Clarendon Press]] published these in French in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;

His talks were concise and lucid, leading students and the general reader to his other, longer writings. Oxford later conferred on him the degree of [[Doctor of Science]].

Two days later he delivered the [[Huxley Lecture]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], taking for his subject ''Life and Consciousness''. This subsequently appeared in ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]'' (October 1911), and since revised, is the first essay in the collected volume ''Mind-Energy'' (''L'Énergie spirituelle''). In October he again traveled to England, where he had an enthusiastic reception, and delivered at [[University College London]] four lectures on ''La Nature de l'Âme'' [The nature of the soul].

In 1913 Bergson visited the United States of America at the invitation of [[Columbia University]], New York, and lectured in several American cities, where very large audiences welcomed him. In February, at Columbia University, he lectured both in French and English, taking as his subjects: ''Spirituality and Freedom'' and ''The Method of Philosophy''. Being again in England in May of the same year, he accepted the Presidency of the British [[Society for Psychical Research]], and delivered to the Society an address on ''Phantoms of Life and Psychic Research'' (Fantômes des vivants et recherche psychique).

Meanwhile, his popularity increased, and translations of his works began to appear in a number of languages: English, German, Italian, Danish, Swedish, Hungarian, Polish, and Russian. In 1914 Bergson's fellow-countrymen honoured him by his election as a member of the [[Académie française]]. He was also made President of the Académie des Sciences morales et politiques, and in addition, he became Officier de la [[Légion d'honneur]], and Officier de l'Instruction publique.

Bergson found disciples of many types. In France movements such as [[Neo-Catholicism (France)|neo-Catholicism]] and [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernism]] on the one hand and [[syndicalism]] on the other endeavoured to absorb and appropriate for their own ends some central ideas of his teaching. The continental organ of socialist and syndicalist theory, ''[[Le Mouvement socialiste]]'',&lt;ref&gt;

portrayed the realism of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] as hostile to all forms of intellectualism, and argued, therefore, that supporters of Marxist socialism should welcome a philosophy such as that of Bergson.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Other writers, in their eagerness, claimed that the thought of the holder of the Chair of Philosophy at the Collège de France, and the aims of the ''[[Confédération Générale du Travail]]'' and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] were in essential agreement.

While social revolutionaries endeavoured to make the most out of Bergson, many religious leaders, particularly the more liberal-minded theologians of all creeds, e.g., the Modernists and Neo-Catholic Party in his own country, showed a keen interest in his writings, and many of them found encouragement and stimulus in his work. The [[Roman Catholic Church]], however, banned Bergson's three books on the charge of [[pantheism]] (that is, of conceiving of God as immanent to his Creation and of being himself created in the process of the Creation).&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; They were placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of prohibited books]] (Decree of 1 June 1914).

===Later years===
In 1914 the Scottish universities arranged for Bergson to give the famous [[Gifford Lectures]], planning one course for the spring and another for the autumn. Bergson delivered the first course, consisting of eleven lectures, under the title of ''The Problem of Personality'', at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in the spring of that year. The course of lectures planned for the autumn months had to be abandoned because of the outbreak of war. Bergson was not, however, silent during the conflict, and he gave some inspiring addresses. As early as 4 November 1914, he wrote an article entitled ''Wearing and Nonwearing forces'' (La force qui s'use et celle qui ne s'use pas), which appeared in that unique and interesting periodical of the ''[[poilu]]s'', ''Le Bulletin des Armées de la République Française''. A presidential address, ''The Meaning of the War'', was delivered in December 1914, to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques.

Bergson contributed also to the publication arranged by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in honour of King [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I of the Belgians]], ''King Albert's Book'' (Christmas, 1914).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1915 he was succeeded in the office of President of the ''Académie des Sciences morales et politiques'' by [[Alexandre Ribot]], and then delivered a discourse on "The Evolution of German [[Imperialism]]". Meanwhile, he found time to issue at the request of the Minister of Public Instruction a brief summary of French Philosophy. Bergson did a large amount of traveling and lecturing in America during the war. He participated in the negotiations which led to the [[World War I#Entry of the United States|entry of the United States]] in the war. He was there when the French Mission under [[René Viviani]] paid a visit in April and May 1917, following upon America's entry into the conflict. Viviani's book ''La Mission française en Amérique'' (1917), contains a preface by Bergson.

Early in 1918 the ''[[Académie française]]'' received Bergson officially when he took his seat among "The Select Forty" as successor to [[Emile Ollivier]] (the author of the historical work ''L'Empire libéral''). A session was held in January in his honour at which he delivered an address on Ollivier. In the war, Bergson saw the conflict of Mind and Matter, or rather of Life and Mechanism; and thus he shows us the central idea of his own philosophy in action. To no other philosopher has it fallen, during his lifetime, to have his philosophical principles so vividly and so terribly tested.

As many of Bergson's contributions to French periodicals remained relatively inaccessible, he agreed to the request of his friends{{Which|date=November 2009}} to have such works collected and published in two volumes. The first of these was being planned when war broke out. The conclusion of strife was marked by the appearance of a delayed volume in 1919. It bears the title ''Spiritual Energy: Essays and Lectures'' (reprinted as ''Mind-Energy'' – ''L'Énergie spirituelle: essais et conférences''). The advocate of Bergson's philosophy in England, Dr. [[Wildon Carr]], prepared an English translation under the title ''Mind-Energy''. The volume opens with the Huxley Memorial Lecture of 1911, "Life and Consciousness", in a revised and developed form under the title "Consciousness and Life". Signs of Bergson's growing interest in social ethics and in the idea of a future life of personal survival are manifested. The lecture before the Society for Psychical Research is included, as is also the one given in France, ''L'Âme et le Corps'', which contains the substance of the four London lectures on the Soul. The seventh and last article is a reprint of Bergson's famous lecture to the Congress of Philosophy at Geneva in 1904, ''The Psycho-Physiological Paralogism'' (Le paralogisme psycho-physiologique), which now appears as ''Le cerveau et la pensée: une illusion philosophique''. Other articles are on the False Recognition, on Dreams, and Intellectual Effort. The volume is a most welcome production and serves to bring together what Bergson wrote on the concept of mental force, and on his view of "tension" and "detension" as applied to the relation of matter and mind.

In June 1920, the [[University of Cambridge]] honoured him with the degree of [[Doctor of Letters]]. In order that he might devote his full-time to the great new work he was preparing on ethics, religion, and sociology, the Collège de France relieved Bergson of the duties attached to the Chair of Modern Philosophy there. He retained the chair, but no longer delivered lectures, his place being taken by his disciple, the mathematician and philosopher [[Édouard Le Roy]], who supported a [[conventionalism|conventionalist]] stance on the [[foundations of mathematics]], which was adopted by Bergson.&lt;ref name=TheCreativeEvolution&gt;See Chapter III of [https://archive.org/stream/creativeevolu1st00berguoft#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Creative Evolution'']&lt;/ref&gt; Le Roy, who also succeeded to Bergson at the ''Académie française'' and was a fervent Catholic, extended to [[Revelation|revealed truth]] his conventionalism, leading him to privilege faith, heart and sentiment to [[dogma]]s, speculative theology and abstract reasoning. Like Bergson's, his writings were placed on the Index by the Vatican.

===Debate with Albert Einstein===
In the fall of 1922 Bergson's book ''Durée et simultanéité, a propos de la theorie d'Einstein'' (''Duration and Simultaneity: Bergson and the Einsteinian Universe'') was published.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jimena Canales|Canales J.]], ''The Physicist and the Philosopher: Einstein, Bergson and the Debate That Changed Our Understanding of Time'', Princeton, Princeton Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier in the spring Einstein had come to the French Society of Philosophy and briefly replied to a short speech made by Bergson.&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of the meeting:[http://s3.archive-host.com/membres/up/784571560/GrandesConfPhiloSciences/philosc13_einstein_1922.pdf Séance du 6 Avril 1922]&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been often considered as one of his worst, many alleging that his knowledge of physics was insufficient, and that the book did not follow up contemporary developments on physics.&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; (But in "Einstein and the Crisis of Reason", a leading French philosopher, [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], accused Einstein of failing to grasp Bergson's argument. This argument, Merleau-Ponty says, which concerns not the physics of special relativity but its philosophical foundations, addresses paradoxes caused by popular interpretations and misconceptions about the theory, including Einstein's own.&lt;ref&gt;Signs, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, trans. Richard C. McCleary, Northwestern Univ. Press, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;) It was not published in the 1951 ''Edition du Centenaire'' in French, which contained all of his other works, and was only published later in a work gathering different essays, titled ''Mélanges''. ''Duration and simultaneity'' took advantage of Bergson's experience at the [[League of Nations]], where he presided from 1920 to 1925 the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] (the ancestor of the [[UNESCO]], which included Einstein, [[Marie Curie]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;On the relation between Einstein and Bergson in this Committee, see [http://www.jimenacanales.org/pdf-files/canales-Einstein,%20Bergson%20and%20the%20Experiment%20that%20Failed.pdf ''Einstein, Bergson and the Experiment that Failed: Intellectual Cooperation at the League of Nations''].

===Later years and death===
While living with his wife and daughter in a modest house in a quiet street near the Porte d'Auteuil in Paris, Bergson won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1927 for having written ''The Creative Evolution''. Because of serious [[rheumatology|rheumatics ailments]], he could not travel to Stockholm, and sent instead a text subsequently published in ''La Pensée et le mouvant''.&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1928.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his retirement from the Collège, Bergson began to fade into obscurity: he suffered from a degenerative illness (rheumatism, which left him half paralyzed&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt;). He completed his new work, ''The Two Sources of Morality and Religion'', which extended his philosophical theories to the realms of morality, religion, and art, in 1935. It was respectfully received by the public and the philosophical community, but all by that time realized that Bergson's days as a philosophical luminary were passed. He was, however, able to reiterate his core beliefs near the end of his life, by renouncing all of the posts and honours previously awarded him, rather than accept exemption from the [[Statute on Jews|antisemitic laws]] imposed by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government.

Bergson inclined to convert to Catholicism, writing in his will on 7 February 1937: "My thinking has always brought me nearer to Catholicism, in which I saw the perfect complement to Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: {{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Though wishing to convert to Catholicism, as stated in his will, he did not convert in view of the travails inflicted on the Jewish people by the rise of [[Nazism]] and [[anti-Semitism]] in Europe in the 1930s; he did not want to appear to want to leave the persecuted. On 3 January 1941 Bergson died in occupied Paris from bronchitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/library/henri-bergson/biography/ |title=Henri Bergson – Philosopher – Biography |work=www.egs.edu |date=3 January 1941 |accessdate=17 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527113913/http://www.egs.edu/library/henri-bergson/biography/ |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A Roman Catholic priest said prayers at his funeral per his request. Bergson is buried in the Cimetière de Garches, [[Hauts-de-Seine]].

==Philosophy==
Bergson rejected what he saw as the overly mechanistic predominant view of causality (as expressed in, say, [[finalism]]). He argued that we must allow space for free will to unfold in an autonomous and unpredictable fashion. While Kant saw free will as something beyond time and space and therefore ultimately a matter of faith, Bergson attempted to redefine the modern conceptions of time, space, and causality in his concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|Duration]], making room for a tangible marriage of free will with causality. Seeing Duration as a mobile and fluid concept, Bergson argued that one cannot understand Duration through "immobile" analysis, but only through experiential, first-person [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Creativity===
Bergson considers the appearance of novelty as a result of pure undetermined creation, instead of as the predetermined result of mechanistic forces. His philosophy emphasises pure mobility, unforeseeable novelty, creativity and freedom; thus one can characterize his system as a [[process philosophy]]. It touches upon such topics as time and identity, [[free will]], perception, change, memory, consciousness, language, the [[foundation of mathematics]] and the limits of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Bergson explores these topics in ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness'', in ''Matter and Memory'', in ''Creative Evolution'', and in ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics''.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticizing [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s theory of knowledge exposed in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and his conception of truth – which he compares to [[Plato]]'s conception of truth as its symmetrical inversion (order of nature/order of thought) – Bergson attempted to redefine the relations between science and metaphysics, intelligence and [[intuition (Bergson)|intuition]], and insisted on the necessity of increasing thought's possibility through the use of intuition, which, according to him, alone approached a knowledge of the absolute and of real life, understood as pure [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]. Because of his (relative) criticism of intelligence, he makes a frequent use of images and metaphors in his writings in order to avoid the use of [[concept]]s, which (he considers) fail to touch the whole of reality, being only a sort of abstract net thrown on things. For instance, he says in ''The Creative Evolution'' (chap. III) that thought in itself would never have thought it possible for the human being to swim, as it cannot deduce swimming from walking. For swimming to be possible, man must throw itself in water, and only then can thought consider swimming as possible. Intelligence, for Bergson, is a practical faculty rather than a pure speculative faculty, a product of evolution used by man to survive. If metaphysics is to avoid "false problems", it should not extend the abstract concepts of intelligence to pure speculation, but rather use intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Elie During, ''[http://ciepfc.rhapsodyk.net/article.php3?id_article=63 « Fantômes de problèmes »]'', published by the ''[[Centre International d'Etudes de la Philosophie Française Contemporaine]]'' (short version first published in ''[[Le magazine littéraire]]'', n°386, April 2000 (issue dedicated to Bergson)&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Creative Evolution'' in particular attempted to think through the continuous creation of life, and explicitly pitted itself against [[Herbert Spencer]]'s evolutionary philosophy. Spencer had attempted to transpose [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] in philosophy and to construct a [[cosmology]] based on this theory (Spencer also coined the expression "[[survival of the fittest]]"). Bergson disputed what he saw as Spencer's mechanistic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 11 to 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergson's ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' ([[philosophy of life]]) can be seen as a response to the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic philosophies]] of his time,&lt;ref name="Creative_Mind"&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 11 to 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  but also to the failure of [[finalism]].&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; Indeed, he considers that finalism is unable to explain "duration" and the "continuous creation of life", as it only explains life as the progressive development of an initially determined program – a notion which remains, for example, in the expression of a "[[genetics|genetic]] program";&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; such a description of finalism was adopted, for instance, by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; It clearly announces [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s.

Bergson regarded planning beforehand for the future as impossible, since time itself unravels unforeseen possibilities. Indeed, one could always explain a historical event retrospectively by its conditions of possibility. But, in the introduction to the ''Pensée et le mouvant'', he explains that such an event created retrospectively its causes, taking the example of the creation of a work of art, for example a symphony: it was impossible to predict what would be the symphony of the future, as if the musician knew what symphony would be the best for his time, he would realize it. In his words, the effect created its cause. Henceforth, he attempted to find a third way between mechanism and finalism, through the notion of an original impulse, the ''élan vital'', in life, which dispersed itself through evolution into contradictory tendencies (he substituted to the finalist notion of a [[teleological]] aim a notion of an original impulse).

===Duration===
{{See also|Duration (philosophy)}}
The foundation of Henri Bergson's philosophy, his theory of [[Duration (philosophy)|Duration]], he discovered when trying to improve the inadequacies of [[Herbert Spencer]]'s philosophy.&lt;ref name="Creative_Mind"/&gt; Bergson introduced Duration as a theory of time and [[consciousness]] in his doctoral thesis ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness'' as a response to another of his influences: [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref name="Stanford_Kant"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''], "Henri Bergson": "'Time and Free Will' has to be seen as an attack on Kant, for whom freedom belongs to a realm outside of space and time."&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant believed that free will (better perceived as The Will) could only exist outside of time and space, indeed the only non-determined aspect of our private existence in the universe, separate to water cycles, mathematics and mortality. However, we could therefore not know whether or not it exists, and that it is nothing but a pragmatic faith.&lt;ref name="Stanford_Kant"/&gt; Bergson responded that Kant, along with many other philosophers, had confused time with its spatial representation.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness'', Author's Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Bergson argued, Duration is unextended yet heterogeneous, and so its parts cannot be juxtaposed as a succession of distinct parts, with one causing the other. Based on this he concluded that determinism is an impossibility and free will pure mobility, which is what Bergson identified as being the Duration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''], "Henri Bergson": "For Bergson – and perhaps this is his greatest insight – freedom is mobility."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intuitionism===
{{See also|Intuition (Bergson)}}
Duration, as defined by Bergson, then is a unity and a multiplicity, but, being mobile, it cannot be grasped through immobile concepts. Bergson hence argues that one can grasp it only through his method of [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]]. Two images from Henri Bergson's ''An Introduction to Metaphysics'' may help one to grasp Bergson's term intuition, the limits of concepts, and the ability of intuition to grasp the absolute. The first image is that of a city. Analysis, or the creation of concepts through the divisions of points of view, can only ever give us a model of the city through a construction of photographs taken from every possible point of view, yet it can never give us the dimensional value of walking in the city itself. One can only grasp this through intuition; likewise the experience of reading a line of [[Homer]]. One may translate the line and pile commentary upon commentary, but this commentary too shall never grasp the simple dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its originality itself. The method of intuition, then, is that of getting back to the things themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 160 to 161. For a Whiteheadian use of Bergsonian intuition, see [[Michel Weber]]'s ''[https://www.academia.edu/279953/Whiteheads_Pancreativism._The_Basics Whitehead’s Pancreativism. The Basics]''. Foreword by [[Nicholas Rescher]], Frankfurt / Paris, Ontos Verlag, 2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Élan vital''===
{{See also|Élan vital}}

''Élan vital'' ranks as Bergson's third essential concept, after Duration and intuition. An idea with the goal of explaining evolution, the ''élan vital'' first appeared in 1907's ''Creative Evolution''. Bergson portrays ''élan vital'' as a kind of vital impetus which explains evolution in a less mechanical and more lively manner, as well as accounting for the creative impulse of mankind. This concept led several authors to characterize Bergson as a supporter of [[vitalism]]—although he criticized it explicitly in ''The Creative Evolution'', as he thought, against [[Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch|Driesch]] and [[Johannes Reinke]] (whom he cited) that there is neither "purely internal finality nor clearly cut individuality in nature":&lt;ref&gt;''L'Évolution créatrice'', pp. 42–44; pp. 226–227&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hereby lies the stumbling block of vitalist theories ... It is thus in vain that one pretends to reduce finality to the individuality of the living being. If there is finality in the world of life, it encompasses the whole of life in one indivisible embrace.&lt;ref&gt;''L'Évolution créatrice'', pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Laughter===
In ''[[Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic]]'', Bergson develops a theory not of laughter itself but of how laughter can be provoked (see his objection to Delage, published in the 23rd edition of the essay).&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; He describes the process of laughter (refusing to give a conceptual definition which would not approach its reality&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt;), used in particular by comics and [[clown]]s, as caricature of the mechanistic nature of humans (habits, automatic acts, etc.), one of the two tendencies of life (degradation towards inert matter and mechanism, and continual creation of new forms).&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; However, Bergson warns us that laughter's criterion of what should be laughed at is not a moral criterion and that it can in fact cause serious damage to a person's [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timoroso.com/philosophy/writings/sketches/2006-04-09-henri-bergsons-theory-of-laughter Henri Bergson's theory of laughter]. A brief summary.&lt;/ref&gt; This essay made his opposition to the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] theory of the animal-machine obvious.&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt;

==Reception==
From his first publications, Bergson's philosophy attracted strong criticism from different quarters, although he also became very popular and durably influenced [[French philosophy]].  The mathematician [[Édouard Le Roy]] became Bergson's main disciple. Nonetheless, Suzanne Guerlac has argued that his institutional position at the Collège de France, delivering lectures to a general audience, may have retarded the systematic reception of his thought: "Bergson achieved enormous popular success in this context, often due to the emotional appeal of his ideas.  But he did not have the equivalent of graduate students who might have become rigorous interpreters of his thought.  Thus Bergson's philosophy—in principle open and nonsystematic—was easily borrowed piecemeal and altered by enthusiastic admirers".&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Guerlac, ''Thinking in Time: An Introduction to Henri Bergson'', Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2006, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred North Whitehead]] acknowledged Bergson's influence on his [[process philosophy]] in his 1929 ''[[Process and Reality]].''&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ronny Desmet and [[Michel Weber]] (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Éditions Chromatika, 2010 &amp; [[Michel Weber]], ''[https://www.academia.edu/279953/Whiteheads_Pancreativism._The_Basics Whitehead’s Pancreativism. The Basics]''. Foreword by Nicholas Rescher, Frankfurt / Paris, ontos verlag, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Bertrand Russell]], Whitehead's collaborator on ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', was not so entranced by Bergson's philosophy. Although acknowledging Bergson's literary skills, Russell saw Bergson's arguments at best as persuasive or emotive speculation but not at all as any worthwhile example of sound reasoning or philosophical insight.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B.; "The Philosophy of Bergson," The Monist 1912 vol. 22 pp.&amp;nbsp;321–347&lt;/ref&gt; The [[epistemology|epistemologist]] [[Gaston Bachelard]] explicitly alluded to him in the last pages of his 1938 book ''The Formation of the Scientific Mind''. Others influenced by Bergson include [[Vladimir Jankélévitch]], who wrote a book on him in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;entitled ''Henri Bergson''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]] who wrote ''Le bergsonisme'' in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;transl. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergson also influenced the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]],&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Moran, ''Introduction to Phenomenology'', 2000, pp. 322 and 393.&lt;/ref&gt; although Merleau-Ponty had reservations about Bergson's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Vatican]] accused Bergson of [[pantheism]], while [[freethought|free-thinkers]]{{Who|date=September 2009}} (who formed a large part of the teachers and professors of the [[French Third Republic]]) accused him of [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualism]]. Still others have characterized his philosophy as a [[emergent materialism|materialist emergentism]] – [[Samuel Alexander]] and [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] explicitly claimed Bergson as their forebear.&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; According to Henri Hude (1990, II, p.&amp;nbsp;142), who supports himself on the whole of Bergson's works as well as his now published courses, accusing him of pantheism is a "counter-sense". Hude alleges that a [[mysticism|mystical experience]], roughly outlined at the end of ''Les Deux sources de la morale et de la religion'', is the inner principle of his whole philosophy, although this has been contested by other commentators.

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] took strong exception to those who associated him with Bergson. In response to a letter comparing his work with that of Bergson he wrote, "a man who seeks to further science can hardly commit a greater sin than to use the terms of his science without anxious care to use them with strict accuracy; it is not very gratifying to my feelings to be classed along with a Bergson who seems to be doing his utmost to muddle all distinctions." [[William James]]'s students resisted the assimilation of his work to that of Bergson. See, for example, [[Horace Kallen]]'s book on the subject ''James and Bergson''. As [[Jean Wahl]] described the "ultimate disagreement" between James and Bergson in his ''System of Metaphysics'': "for James, the consideration of action is necessary for the definition of truth, according to Bergson, action ... must be kept from our mind if we want to see the truth"{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}. Gide even went so far as to say that future historians will overestimate Bergson's influence on art and philosophy just because he was the self-appointed spokesman for "the spirit of the age".

As early as the 1890s, Santayana attacked certain key concepts in Bergson's philosophy, above all his view of the New and the indeterminate:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the possibility of a new and unaccountable fact appearing at any time," he writes in his book on [[Hermann Lotze]], "does not practically affect the method of investigation; ... the only thing given up is the hope that these hypotheses may ever be adequate to the reality and cover the process of nature without leaving a remainder. This is no great renunciation; for that consummation of science ... is by no one really expected.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Santayana and Russell, Bergson projected false claims onto the aspirations of scientific method, claims which Bergson needed to make in order to justify his prior moral commitment to freedom. Russell takes particular exception to Bergson's understanding of number in chapter two of ''Time and Free-will''. According to Russell, Bergson uses an outmoded spatial metaphor ("extended images") to describe the nature of mathematics as well as [[logic]] in general. "Bergson only succeeds in making his theory of number possible by confusing a particular collection with the number of its terms, and this again with number in general", writes Russell (see ''The Philosophy of Bergson''{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} and ''A History of Western Philosophy''{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}).

Furthermore, writers such as Russell, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], and James saw ''élan vital'' as a projection of subjectivity onto the world. The external world, according to certain{{Which|date=November 2009}} theories of [[probability]], provides less and less indeterminism with further refinement of scientific method. In brief, one should not confuse the moral, psychological, subjective demand for the new, the underivable and the unexplained with the universe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} One's subjective sense of duration differs the (non-human) world, a difference which, according to the ancient materialist [[Lucretius]] should not be characterized as either one of becoming or being, creation or destruction (''[[De Rerum Natura]]'').

[[Suzanne Guerlac]] has argued that the more recent resurgence of scholarly interest in Bergson is related to the growing influence of his follower [[Deleuze]] within [[continental philosophy]]: "If there is a return to Bergson today, then, it is largely due to Gilles Deleuze whose own work has etched the contours of the New Bergson.  This is not only because Deleuze wrote about Bergson; it is also because Deleuze's own thought is deeply engaged with that of his predecessor, even when Bergson is not explicitly mentioned."&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Guerlac, ''Thinking in Time: An Introduction to Henri Bergson'', Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2006, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Lawlor]] and Valentine Moulard agree with Guerlac that "the recent revitalization of Bergsonism ... is almost entirely due to Deleuze."  They explain that Bergson's concept of multiplicity "is at the very heart of Deleuze's thought, and [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]] is the model for all of Deleuze's 'becomings.'  The other aspect that attracted Deleuze, which is indeed connected to the first, is Bergson's criticism of the concept of negation in Creative Evolution. ... Thus Bergson became a resource in the criticism of the [[Hegel]]ian [[Dialectic#Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]], the negative."&lt;ref name=LawlorMoulard2011&gt;{{citation |author=Leonard Lawlor and Valentine Moulard |chapter=The revitalization of Bergsonism |title=Henri Bergson |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |origyear= 18 May 2004|date= 12 July 2011 |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/#7 |accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to Eastern philosophies===
Several [[Hindu]] authors have found parallels to Hindu philosophy in Bergson's thought. The integrative evolutionism of [[Sri Aurobindo]], an Indian philosopher from the early 20th century, has many similarities to Bergson's philosophy. Whether this represents a direct influence of Bergson is disputed, although Aurobindo was familiar with many Western philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;K Mackenzie Brown. "Hindu perspectives on evolution: Darwin, Dharma, and Design". Routledge, Jan 2012. Page 164-166&lt;/ref&gt; K Narayanaswami Aiyer, a member of the [[Theosophical Society]], published a pamphlet titled "Professor Bergson and the Hindu Vedanta", where he argued that Bergson's ideas on matter, consciousness, and evolution were in agreement with Vedantic and Puranic explanations.&lt;ref&gt;KN Aiyer.

Hervaeus Natalis Brito. There was another [[Hervaeus Brito]] of the early 13th century.&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 1260, [[Nédellec]], [[diocese of Tréguier]], [[Brittany]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://edit16.iccu.sbn.it/scripts/iccu_ext.dll?fn=11&amp;res=6501 Risultato della ricerca Web OPAC ICCU&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;-1323) was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] theologian, the 14th Master of the Dominicans, and the author of a number of works on philosophy and theology.  Among his many writings may be included the ''Summa Totius Logicae'', an ''opusculum'' once attributed to [[Thomas Aquinas]].

==Life==

Natalis joined the Dominicans in 1276.  In 1303, he entered the convent of St. Jacques at the University of Paris.  On his arrival to St. Jacques, he signed a petition supporting Philip the Fair's attempt to convoke a council in his war with Pope Boniface VIII on grounds of papal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pasnau|first=Robert|title=The Cambridge History of Medieval Philosophy|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied theology in Paris&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/1298h-j.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611131207/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/1298h-j.htm |archivedate=2007-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and became French provincial of the Dominicans in 1308.  Later in 1318, he was appointed Master General of the Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowe|first=Elizabeth|title=The Contested Theological Authority of Thomas Aquinas: The Controversies between Hervaeus Natalis and Durandus of St. Pourcain|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A resolute early [[Thomist]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetpadre.com/reality.htm]: ''The first Thomists appear at the end of the thirteenth century and the beginning of the fourteenth. They defend St. Thomas against certain Augustinians of the ancient school, against the Nominalists and the Scotists. In particular, the works of Herve de Nedellec against [[Henry of Ghent]]; of [[Thomas Sutton (Dominican)|Thomas Sutton]] against Scotus, of [[Durandus of Aurillac]] against Durandus of Saint-Pourcain and against the first [[Nominalists]].''&lt;/ref&gt; nicknamed ''Doctor rarus'', he was a tenacious opponent of the theology of [[Durandus of Saint-Pourçain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domcentral.org/trad/shorthistory/short04.htm], {{cite web|url=http://www.domcentral.org/study/ashley/dominicans/ashdom03.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725064028/http://www.domcentral.org/study/ashley/dominicans/ashdom03.htm |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }}. His predecessor as Master had appointed him, [[Peter de la Palu]], [[John of Naples]] and others as a theological commission to assess the ideas of Durandus.&lt;/ref&gt; He also opposed [[Scotism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14588a.htm]: ''a valiant opponent of Scotus''.&lt;/ref&gt; He sought for and obtained the [[canonization]] of Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domcentral.org/study/ashley/dominicans/ashdom03.htm Ashley/Dominicans: 3 Mystics 1300s&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725064028/http://www.domcentral.org/study/ashley/dominicans/ashdom03.htm |date=2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became [[Master of the Order of Preachers]] in 1318, a post he held until he died in 1323 on the way to attend the canonization of Thomas Aquinas.

==As Master of the Order==

Natalis' tenure as master general of the Order was focused on removing the corruption prevalent in the Dominican Order.  His ordered a series of acts that limited the privileges of the elites within the Order.  These acts ordered high members of the Order to take part in choir and eat in the refectory along with abolishing the use of titles1.  In addition to these acts, Natalis sought to reign in the studia generalia by abolishing the title magister.  He also sought to centralize the curriculum and appointments of the studia generalia to the Master General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowe|first=Elizabeth|title=The Contested Theological Authority of Thomas Aquinas: The Controversies between Hervaeus Natalis and Durandus of St. Pourcain|year=2003|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences with Durandus of St. Pourçain==

While Natalis was Durandus' mentor, the two scholars disputed on numerous theological ideas. In a commission investigating the works of Durandus, Natalis found 91 objectionable propositions.  From 1309 to 1316, a polemical war ensued between Hervaeus Natalis and  Durandus of St. Pourçain.  Throughout those years, both Natalis and Durandus of St. Pourçain exchanged polemics and writings that sought to disprove the other.  Near the end of this war, Hervaeus Natalis compiled two censure lists, one in 1314 and one in 1316.  These lists gathered the problematic tenets of Durandus' works, and in turn, compelled Durandus to revise his work.

Notable works concerning this polemical war include Reprobationes excusationum Durandi, Quodlibet III, and Correctiones super dicta Durandi in Quodlibet Avenonense I.  These works either reprimanded Durandus or responded to Durandus' counterattacks to Natalis' arguments.  One of Natalis' most significant counters to Durandus was in his Evidentiae contra Durandum super Ivum sent, in which Natalis examines 38 articles where Durandus deviated from the teachings of Aquinas regarding the sacraments

'''Holmes Rolston III''' (born November 19, 1932) is a philosopher who is University Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at [[Colorado State University]]. He is best known for his contributions to [[environmental ethics]] and the [[relationship between science and religion]]. Among other honors, Rolston won the 2003 [[Templeton Prize]], awarded by [[Prince Philip]] in [[Buckingham Palace]].  He gave the [[Gifford Lectures]], [[University of Edinburgh]], 1997–1998.

The [[Darwinian]] model is used to define the main thematic concepts in Rolston's philosophy and, in greater depth, the general trend of his thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index226.html Afeissa, H.

==Life==

'''Jens Kraft''' (1720–1756) was a [[Danish people|Danish]] [[mathematics|mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] of [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] birth. He was born in [[Frederikshald]] in [[Norway]], but at age 5 he became an orphan and was subsequently raised by his uncle in [[Thy (district)|Thy]] in [[Jutland]]. As a philosopher he introduced the study of [[ontology]] to [[Scandinavia]]n academic circles.

He was influenced by [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] whilst still a student at [[Copenhagen]], attending a lecture by Wolff while visiting [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle]]. He was appointed professor of philosophy at the [[Sorø Academy]], where he responded to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]]'s ''Metaphsica'' with his own text ''metaphysik''. Both divided their work into ''[[cosmology|cosmologie]]'', ''[[ontology|ontologie]]'', ''[[psychology|psykologie]]'' and ''[[natural theology|naturlig theologie]]''.

Kraft made a distinction between [[time]] and [[eternity]] writing that "the finite can never obtain eternity, but it can obtain an infinite time, (Aevum) or a time with beginning but without end." The infinite by contrast has permanence (''sempiternité'')".

'''Julián Marías Aguilera''' (17 June 1914 – 15 December 2005) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] associated with the [[Generation of '36]] movement. He was a pupil of the Spanish philosopher [[José Ortega y Gasset]].

== Life and work ==
Marías was born in the city of [[Valladolid]], and moved to [[Madrid]] at the age of five. He went on to study philosophy at the [[Complutense University of Madrid]], graduating in 1936. Within months of his graduation the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out. During the conflict Marías sided with the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]], although his actual contributions were limited to propaganda articles and broadcasts.

Following the end of the war in 1939, Marías returned to education. His doctoral thesis was rejected by the university, however, and handed over to the police, due to his inclusion of a number of lines critical of the rule of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. As a consequence of his writings Marías was briefly imprisoned and, upon his release, banned from teaching. Fortunately for Marías the proceeds from the sales of his ''History of Philosophy'', which went through countless editions, meant that the punishment did not seriously damage his livelihood.

In 1948 he co-founded, along with his former teacher José Ortega y Gasset, the Instituto de Humanidades (which he went on to head after the death of Ortega in 1955). Between the late 1940s and the 1970s, being unable to teach in Spain, Marías taught at numerous institutions in the [[United States]], including [[Harvard University]], [[Yale University]], [[Wellesley College]], and [[UCLA]].

Marías wrote on a wide variety of subjects during his long career. A subject of particular interest was [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes's]] ''[[Don Quixote]]''. In 1964 he was elected into the [[Real Academia Española]], and he won a [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias award]] in 1996.

He is the father of novelist [[Javier Marías]] and art historian Fernando Marías, and married the sister of director [[Jesús Franco]].

'''Keith Wylie Faulkner''' is a British academic specializing in the work of [[Gilles Deleuze]]. He received his Ph.D in philosophy from the [[University of Warwick]], UK. He is known for authoring ''Deleuze and the Three Syntheses of Time'' on Deleuze's theory of time, which he calls the most important theory of time since [[Heidegger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deleuze and the Three Syntheses of Time |url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=46302 |website=peterlang.com |publisher=Peter Lang |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714225743/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=46302 |archivedate=2015-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
According to [[Keith Ansell-Pearson|Ansell-Pearson]] Faulkner's "treatment of Deleuze’s three syntheses of time provides the analytical depth and intellectual profundity lacking in existing accounts." Calling it a 'must' read for the serious student and scholar of Deleuze, he says it rewards anyone with an interest in [[philosophy of time]]. According to Daniel W. Smith, Faulkner "tackles one of the most important but also most difficult aspects of Deleuze’s philosophy - the theory of temporality ([[Difference and Repetition|repetition]]) - and his analyses of the 'three syntheses' are not only rigorous and penetrating, but also accessible."

Apart from playing a leading role in [[Malta]]’s national educational policy development, and in the setting of the national [[curriculum]], he continued to contribute actively in the field as chairman of the Foundation for Tomorrow’s Schools, and of the Foundation for Educational Services. Wain is also a board member of the International Network of Philosophers of Education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucm.es/info/inpe/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Wain was appointed Commissioner for Voluntary Organisations.

==Appreciation==
Being an educationist with a pronounced bend towards the western model of [[democracy]], Wain’s early philosophy was very much influenced by [[John Dewey]]. His later philosophy also draws on the works of [[poststructuralist]] philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Richard Rorty]].

This can be especially gauged from Wain’s interest in the concept of [[lifelong learning]], which, he maintains, should not be infected with any mania for efficient productivity in relation to [[political ideology]], but, on the contrary, should be imbued with a broad [[humanistic]] awareness. This corroborates Wain’s understanding of [[democracy]], which, to him, has more to do with individual maturity and responsibility and less with State hegemony or political performance. According to Wain, [[education]] and [[democracy]] are handmaids of each other. His political, moral, and aesthetic, philosophies, to be sure, all stem from, and are based on, this foundation.

''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been adopted by numerous other occultists, such as [[Kenneth Grant]], and has been particularly influential on the [[chaos magic]] movement.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

[[Phil Baker (writer)|Phil Baker]] has speculated that the word "Kia" may have been influenced by "esoteric Eastern and cabalistic words" such as [[Qi|''ki'', ''chi'']], [[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|''khya'' and ''chiah'']]. Or, alternatively, it may have been taken from ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' by [[Madame Blavatsky]], which refers to a universal power called "Kia-yu".&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==

The first reference to "Kia" appears on a painting exhibited by Spare in 1904, when he was just 17 years old.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Spare conceived of Kia as a sort of [[universal mind]], of which individual human consciousnesses are aspects.&lt;ref name=Spare1&gt;[[#refSpare1|Spare, Austin Osman. ''The Book of Pleasure'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Spare further elaborated on the concept in ''The Book of Pleasure'' (1913), introducing it with the words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Of name it has no name, to designate. I call it Kia I dare not claim it as myself. The Kia which can be expressed by conceivable ideas, is not the eternal Kia, which burns up all belief but is the archetype of "self," the slavery of mortality.&lt;ref name=Spare1&gt;[[#refSpare1|Spare, Austin Osman. ''The Book of Pleasure'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Spare's words here bear marked resemblance to the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'', which states "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao; The name that can be named is not the eternal name."&lt;ref name=Tao&gt;[[#refTao|Lao Tzu. ''Tao Te Ching'']]&lt;/ref&gt; – and like the Tao, or the [[Hindu]] [[Brahman]], or the [[Sunyata]] of [[Buddhism]], Spare's conception of Kia combined pure transcendent consciousness with a voidness inherent in all things.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer and occultist [[Kenneth Grant]], who had known Spare in the 1950s,&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt; promoted Spare's ideas after his death, referring to his system as "Zos Kia Cultus".&lt;ref name=Grant1&gt;[[#refGrant1|Grant, Kenneth. ''Cults of the Shadow'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Grant emphasises the similarities between Kia and certain concepts from Eastern philosophy, comparing it to the [[Yab-Yum]] of [[Tantra]], and describing reality as the dream of Kia.&lt;ref name=Grant2&gt;[[#refGrant2|Grant, Kenneth. ''Hidden Lore: The Carfax Monograms'']]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Grant also states that Kia differs from the Buddhist concept of voidness, in that it is realised through the body, rather than the mind, stating: "The Kia is present everywhere, but the immediacy of its realisation is sought through the flesh, as in Zen it is apprehended through the mind. The object is the same in both methods, but the means appear to vary."&lt;ref name=Grant2&gt;[[#refGrant2|Grant, Kenneth. ''Hidden Lore: The Carfax Monograms'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant also departs from Spare in conceptualising Kia as inherently ''feminine'', equating it with both the [[Wicca|Wiccan]] [[Triple_Goddess_(Neopaganism)|Goddess]]&lt;ref name=Grant2&gt;[[#refGrant2|Grant, Kenneth. ''Hidden Lore: The Carfax Monograms'']]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aleister Crowley|Aleister Crowley's]] [[Babalon]]&lt;ref name=Grant3&gt;[[#refGrant3|Grant, Kenneth. ''The Magical Revival'']]&lt;/ref&gt; – the basic idea being that Kia is a sort of all-encompassing void that is impregnated by the will of the magician, and that gives birth to magical results.&lt;ref name=Grant3&gt;[[#refGrant3|Grant, Kenneth. ''The Magical Revival'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter J. Carroll]], one of the founders of [[chaos magic]] (along with [[Ray Sherwin]]), elaborated a system heavily influenced by Spare in his early writings, particularly ''Liber Null'' (1978).&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt; However, somewhat confusingly, Carroll uses the term "Kia" to refer to the consciousness of the individual: "the elusive 'I' which confers self-awareness".&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt; The more general universal force, of which Kia is an aspect, Carroll termed "Chaos".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The unity which appears to the mind to exert the twin functions of will and perception is called ''Kia'' by magicians. Sometimes it is called the spirit, or soul, or life force, instead... Kia is capable of occult power because it is a fragment of the great life force of the universe... The "thing" responsible for the origin and continued action of events is called ''Chaos'' by magicians... Chaos... is the force which has caused life to evolve itself out of dust, and is currently most concentratedly manifest in the human life force, or Kia, where it is the source of consciousness... To the extent that the Kia can become one with Chaos it can extend its will and perception into the universe to accomplish magic.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Kuruvilla Pandikattu''' (born 28 November 1957) is an Indian [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Catholic priest|priest]] and Professor of Philosophy, Science and Religion at [[Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth]]: Institute of Philosophy and Religion, [[Pune]], Maharashtra, India.&lt;ref&gt;Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth (2010), ''Handbook and Calendar'', Pune: JDV, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also Director of JDV Centre for Science-Religion Studies (JCSR) and Association of Science, Society and Religion (ASSR), Pune.

He has authored/edited twenty-six books and written more than 160 academic articles. He has been involved as co-founder and co-publisher with two journals, ''Jnanadeepa: Pune Journal of Religious Studies'' and ''AUC: Asian Journal of Religious Studies.'' Further, he has organised   more than forty academic conferences. His weekly column on "Contemporary Spirituality" appears on Tuesdays in ''Financial Chronicle''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mydigitalfc.com/2008/kuruvilla-pandikattu-sj&lt;/ref&gt; He has been contributing regularly to both academic and popular journals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smartcompanion.in/client/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

He is involved in science-religion dialogue and science-related activities,&lt;ref&gt;See Mialil, John (2008) ''Wonders in Nature'', New Delhi: Media House, 2008, pp. 121–130.&lt;/ref&gt; in which topic he has been teaching four courses. His areas of interest (and specialisation) include: Science-Religion Dialogue;&lt;ref&gt;It may be noted that together with Prof Job Kozhamthadam, he has started the firsts Masters Programme in Science and Religion at [[Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth]], Pune, India. See also Kozhamthadam, Job (2002) ''Contemporary Science and Religion in Dialogue'', Pune: ASSR, pp.98–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical [[Anthropology]] ([[Emerich Coreth]]); [[Hermeneutics]] ([[Paul Ricœur]]) and Inter-religious dialogue ([[Bede Griffiths]]).

==Philosophical Approach==
The two starting points of his academic research works are in physics and religion: quest for the unification of the fourfold forces of nature in physics and the hermeneutics of dialogue in [[Paul Ricoeur]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://philpapers.org/rec/PANITD&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to seek further the interpretative and symbolic (or mythic) nature of religious experience  and resulted in his first doctoral thesis: ''“Idols to die, so that symbols might live.”'' He traces the idol-symbol tension in every aspect of human experience.

=== Dialogue as Way of Life ===
Then he look up the dialogical dimension of not only of religions, but also of human existence. So his second doctoral thesis on [[Bede Griffiths]] was published under the title, ''"Dialog as Way of Life."''  Further, he took up issues in science-religion dialogue, which according to him is "not an option but an obligation" for the very survival of the human species. This calls for radial commitment.&lt;ref&gt;See Kuruvilla Pandikattu "LSI as Social Web of Committed Entrepreneurs," https://jdv.academia.edu/KuruvillaPandikattu/Papers/956906/LSI_as_Social_Web_of_Committed_Entrepreneurss&lt;/ref&gt; Two main areas of his research are ''[[physical immortality]]''&lt;ref&gt;See https://sites.google.com/site/kurusj/articles&lt;/ref&gt; and ''viable or sustainable life-style''.&lt;ref&gt;Kuruvilla Pandikattu, "Global Village vs Gandhian Villages: A Viable Vision,"  See https://books.google.com/books?id=YrGadHsc1bUC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=viable+or+sustainable+life-style+pandikattu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=esgCrSb21f&amp;sig=8IsOmubP9enLNHf3yREFKqs0gAk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7HtWTaf9L5DSrQeE-pzWBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=viable%20or%20sustainable%20life-style%20pandikattu&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Kuruvilla Pandikattu" See http://www.counterbalance.org/bio/kuru-frame.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humans as "Between Before and Beyond"===
He has been teaching and writing on philosophical anthropology. His view on the human person could be summarised as the "between before and beyond." Following [[Martin Heidegger]], he holds that we always carry with us our past (before) and anticipate our future (beyond) and experience the healthy tension as the "between" or the present.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/kuruvilla-pandikattu&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he would say that human freedom, is the "finite search for the infinite."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Between-Beneath-Before-Beyond-Exploration/dp/8188360023&lt;/ref&gt;

===God as "Ever Approachable, Never Attainable"===
This infinite or God (also The Reality) is the enticing and elusive dimension of our human life. God is ever approachable, but never attainable exhaustively. Like the horizon, that invites and cajoles us and recedes from us, God is always near and far at the same time. He bases this insight on scientific details like the lowest temperature reachable (t →0) and knowing that the beginning of Big Bang (T →0) and is like the "horizon",&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/pandikattujoseph/everapproachable&lt;/ref&gt; which is never fully attainable.

===Reality as Relational and Paradoxical ===

He says that reality is relational and at the same time paradoxical. The paradox of love is that when two people, who have accepted their own emptiness and recognises their own nothingness, affirm each other, there emerges authentic love, that is infinite. Thus, when one truly looks at reality, accepts its nothingness (even absurdity) there emerges traces of infinity. That is the paradoxical beauty of love and of our existence.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.fig.usv.ro/socio-umane/arhiva/2010I.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major Activities==
He has been actively involved in science-religion dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.science-religion-news.org/regular-courses.asp&lt;/ref&gt; He is interested in looking at both science and religion critically and creatively,&lt;ref&gt;https://sapnaonline.com/dancing-to-diversity-science-religion-dialogue-in-india-194680&lt;/ref&gt; so that they can enrich each other and the humanity. In this area he has delivered numerous lectures, written numerous articles and books and organised conferences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jdv.edu.in&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7864">'''Leslie Armour''' (9 March 1931 – 1 November 2014) was a Canadian-born [[philosopher]] and writer on social economics. He is the father of the [[cellist]] and [[impresario]] [[Julian Armour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leslie Armour Obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/ottawacitizen/obituary.aspx?pid=173084915|accessdate=25 June 2015|agency=The Ottawa Citizen|date=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Armour completed a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1952 and a [[PhD]] at the [[University of London]] in 1956. At the time of his death, he was a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] and a Research Professor of Philosophy at the [[Dominican University College]], [[Ottawa]], Adjunct Professor of Philosophical Theology at [[St. Paul University]], and Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Ottawa]]. He taught at universities in Montana, California, and Ohio. From 2004 to 2010, he was editor of the ''International Journal of Social Economics''. His major areas of research included metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy, the philosophical underpinnings of economics and "he is a pioneer in publishing early Canadian philosophy and has philosophical publications in metaphysics, religion, law, politics and economics".&lt;ref&gt;"Armour, Leslie", ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Armour has contributed significantly to the interdisciplinary school of [[Canadian Studies]].

He authored nine books (three with co-authors), more than seventy chapters in books and a hundred articles in scholarly journals.  He was a frequent speaker at conferences on economics, religious studies and French and German philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;"Armour, Leslie", ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a bibliography to 2001 and extensive commentaries on Armour's work in William Sweet's ''Idealism, Metaphysics, and Community''.&lt;ref&gt;William Sweet, ed., ''Idealism, Metaphysics, and Community'', Ashgate, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Inference and Persuasion''==
Armour's most recent book, ''Inference and Persuasion: An Introduction to Logic and Critical Reasoning'' (2005), was co-authored by Richard Feist. It is written so as to be accessible to all audiences and is concerned with the problems associated with logic, offering suggestions rather than solutions, for, as Armour states, nothing is certain. This book discusses meaning-assignment, rule-making, beliefs, and the correlation between belief and action. It pays special attention to how these are misunderstood, corrupted and blocked so that we are robbed of our freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Armour and Feist, ''Inference and Persuasion'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argue that reason and experience are both important to logic, and that logic is important because it allows for understanding and survival.&lt;ref&gt;''Inference and Persuasion'', Preface&lt;/ref&gt;

Inference is described as the beliefs and judgments that create rules.  Inference and rule are tools that we use for freedom. We think for ourselves and draw our own conclusions; knowledge permits freedom to act.  Yet the way inferences are drawn is subject to the influence of logicians, such as Aristotle, and their language.&lt;ref&gt;''Inference and Persuasion'', pp. 1–22&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's focus on class inclusion and exclusion highlights the limits of the language of logic. This idea of classification is problematic, as it ignores things not included in a class and the fact that the meaning of classes is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;''Inference and Persuasion'', pp. 18–22&lt;/ref&gt; "Trying to lay out axioms or rules in advance... will always lead to limitations" because "imposing systems on our thinking seems to bring limits into play".&lt;ref&gt;''Inference and Persuasion'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Examining John Dewey's logic (Chapter Four), the notion that reason and experience are interconnected is evident. Logic is concerned with the 'human world', which is not the 'world in itself'.&lt;ref&gt;''Inference and Persuasion'', p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking has a purpose; it is a problem solving tool, an attempt to make experience coherent.&lt;ref&gt;''Inference and Persuasion'', pp. 54–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors go through previous theories and views on logic and add interesting and thought-provoking ideas. They note the tensions between experience and logic, the biases associated with reasoning,&lt;ref&gt;"Logic and Morality", ''Inference and Persuasion''&lt;/ref&gt; and the importance of context.&lt;ref&gt;"Logic and Politics", ''Inference and Persuasion''&lt;/ref&gt; In "Logic and Morality" it is argued that our biases inform how we form our understanding of facts. How we reason about what to do is based on practicality, which is based on our values. In "Logic and Politics" we see the notion of classes, as assembled from members, as individualist, with community interests ignored. The authors suggest we must understand the world through relationships, since individuals only exist in context, such as social contexts. Logic has the tendency to either ignore social realities or create individualist societies.&lt;ref&gt;''Inference and Persuasion'', pp. 193–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Concluding their text with the limits set by the rules of logic, they state that the ultimate reason for caution in using logic is that "One should not let one's choice of logic impose restrictions on one's freedom — provided of course that one can see rational alternatives. Where that line is drawn readers must decide for themselves"&lt;ref&gt;''Inference and Persuasion'', p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==
Armour was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in August 1998, which recognized his significant contribution to research and scholarly work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.uottawa.ca/perspectives/bravo-article_96.html Centre Stage], August 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucilio Vanini''' (1585{{snd}}9 February 1619), who, in his works, styled himself '''Giulio Cesare Vanini''',&lt;ref&gt;Giulio Cesare is the Italian equivalent of Julius Caesar in English.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Italy|Italian]] philosopher, physician and [[free-thinker]], who was one of the first significant representatives of intellectual [[libertinism]]. He was among the first modern thinkers who viewed the universe as an entity governed by natural laws ([[nomological determinism]]). He was also the first literate proponent of biological evolution, maintaining that humans and other [[ape]]s have common ancestor.

==Life==
===Summary===
Vanini was born at [[Taurisano]] near [[Lecce]], and studied [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at [[Naples]]. Afterwards, he applied himself to the physical studies, chiefly medicine and astronomy, which had come into vogue with the [[Renaissance]]. Like [[Giordano Bruno]], he attacked [[scholasticism]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Vanini, Lucilio|volume=27|page=895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Naples he went to [[Padua]], where he came under the influence of the [[Alexandrists|Alexandrist]] [[Pietro Pomponazzi]], whom he styled his divine master. Subsequently, he led a roving life in [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[Low Countries]], supporting himself by giving lessons and disseminating radical ideas. He was obliged to flee to [[England]] in 1612 but was imprisoned in [[London]] for 49 days.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Returning to Italy, he made an attempt to teach in [[Genoa]] but was driven again to France, where he tried to clear himself of suspicion by publishing a book against [[atheism]]: ''Amphitheatrum Aeternae Providentiae Divino-Magicum'' (1615). Though the definitions of [[God]] are somewhat [[pantheistic]], the book served its immediate purpose. Although Vanini did not expound his true views in his first book, he did in his second: ''De Admirandis Naturae Reginae Deaeque Mortalium Arcanis'' (Paris, 1616). This was originally certified by two doctors of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], but was later re-examined and condemned.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Vanini then left Paris, where he had been staying as chaplain to the [[François Bassompierre|Marechal de Bassompierre]], and began to teach in [[Toulouse]]. In November 1618, he was arrested and, after a prolonged trial, was condemned to have his tongue cut out, to be strangled at the stake and to have his body burned to ashes. The sentence was executed on 9 February 1619.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Early life (1585–1612)===
[[Image:Casa Giulio Cesare Vanini Taurisano.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Vanini's birthplace, Taurisano]]
Lucilio Vanini was born in 1585 in Taurisano, [[Terra d'Otranto]], Italy. His father was Giovan Battista Vanini, a businessman from Tresana in Tuscany, while his mother was the daughter of a man named Lopez de Noguera, a customs contractor of the Spanish royal family's lands in [[Bari]], Terra d'Otranto, [[Capitanata]], and [[Basilicata]]. A document dated August 1612, discovered in the [[Vatican Secret Archives]], describes Vanini as of [[Apulia]], which is consistent with the native land he mentions in his own works.

The government census of the population of the hamlet of Taurisano, in 1596, includes the names of Giovan Battista Vanini, his lawful son Alexander, born in 1582, and his natural son Giovan Francesco, while there is no mention of Vanini's wife or of another lawful son called Lucilio (or Giulio Cesare). In 1603 Giovan Battista Vanini is reported for the last time in Taurisano.

Lucilio Vanini entered the University of Naples in 1599.&lt;ref name="Galileo Project"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/vanini.html |title=Vanini, Giulio Cesare |last1=Westfall |first1=Richard S. |website=The Galileo Project |publisher=Rice University, USA |accessdate=26 November 2014}} (based on works by Emile Namer and Andrzej Nowicki)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1603 he  entered the Carmelite order,&lt;ref&gt;A letter from the English ambassador to Venice, Dudley Carleton, dated 7 [but 17] February 1611 [but 1612]; the episode refers to nine years before, or 1603.&lt;/ref&gt; taking the name of Fra Gabriele. He earned a doctorate in canon and civil law from the University of Naples on 6 June 1606.&lt;ref name="Galileo Project" /&gt;

Afterwards, he remained in the Naples area for two years, apparently living as a friar,&lt;ref name="Galileo Project" /&gt; or alternatively he returned to Lecce and studied the new [[Renaissance]] sciences, chiefly medicine and astronomy. By now, he had assimilated much knowledge and "speaks very good Latin and with great ease, is tall and a bit thin, has brown hair, an aquiline nose, lively eyes and a pleasant and ingenious physiognomy".

[[Image:Campo Santa Fosca - Paolo Sarpi.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Statue of Paulo Sarpi in Venice]]
In (probably) 1606, Vanini's father died in Naples. Vanini, now come of age, was recognised by a court in the capital as heir of Giovan Battista and guardian of his brother Alexander. With a series of deeds and power of attorney drawn up in Naples, Vanini began to settle the financial consequences of the death of his father: selling a house he owned in Ugento, a few miles from his home country; in 1607 mandating a maternal uncle to fulfil assignments of the same type; in 1608 instructing friend Scarciglia to recover a sum and sell some goods remaining in Taurisano and held in custody by the two brothers.

In 1608, Vanini moved to [[Padua]], a town under the rule of Venice, to study theology at that university (although there is no record of him subsequently obtaining a degree).&lt;ref name="Galileo Project" /&gt; While there he came into contact with the group led by [[Paolo Sarpi]] that, with the support of the English embassy in Venice, fueled anti-papal polemics. In 1611 he participated in the [[Lent]]en sermons, attracting the suspicions of the religious authorities. During that period, the controversy over the 1606 interdict placed on the Republic of Venice by [[Pope Paul V]] was still raging, and Vanini showed himself unambiguously in favour of the Republic.&lt;ref name="Galileo Project" /&gt; Consequently, the Prior General of his order, Enrico Silvio, commanded him to return to Naples, where he would have been disciplined, probably severely, but instead Vanini sought refuge with the English ambassador to Venice in 1612.&lt;ref name="Galileo Project" /&gt;

===In England (1612–1614)===
Vanini now fled to England, along with his Genoese companion Bonaventure Genocchi. They passed through [[Bologna]], [[Milan]], the Swiss canton of [[Graubünden]], and descended via the [[Rhine]], through [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]], to the [[North Sea]] coast and the [[English Channel]], finally reaching [[London]] and the [[Lambeth]] residence of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Here the two remained for nearly two years, hiding their true identity from their English guests. In July 1612, they both renounced their Catholic faith and embraced [[Anglicanism]].

By 1613, however, Vanini was having doubts, so he appealed to the Pope to be allowed back into the Catholic fold, but as a secular priest rather than as a friar; the request was granted by the Pope himself.&lt;ref name="Galileo Project" /&gt; Around the start of 1614, Vanini visited the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford and confided to some acquaintances his imminent flight from England, so in January, he and Genocchi were arrested on the orders of the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[George Abbot (bishop)|George Abbot]]. They managed to escape however, Genocchi in February 1614 and Vanini in March. The Spanish ambassador in London and the chaplain of the embassy of the Venetian Republic were thought to have engineered their escapes. The two passed through the hands of the papal nuncio in Flanders, [[Guido Bentivoglio]], to the papal nuncio in Paris, [[Roberto Ubaldini]].

===In France (1614–1618)===
In Paris, in the summer of 1614, Vanini subscribed to the principles of the Council of Trent, to prove the sincerity of his return to the Catholic faith. He then journeyed to Italy, going first to Rome, where he had to face the difficult final stages of the process in the court of the Inquisition, then to Genoa for a few months, where he found his friend Genocchi and taught philosophy to children of Scipio Doria for a time.

[[Image:Lucilio (Julius Caesar) Vanini. Line engraving. Wellcome V0005991.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Line engraving of Lucilio (Giulio Cesare) Vanini]]
Despite assurances, the return of Vanini and Genocchi was not entirely peaceful; in January 1615 Genocchi was arrested by the Inquisitor of Genoa. Vanini therefore, fearing the same fate, ran away again to France and headed to Lyon. There, in June 1615, he published ''Amphitheatrum'', a book against atheism, which he hoped would clear his name with the Roman authorities.

A short time later Vanini returned to Paris, where he asked Nuncio Ubaldini to intervene on his behalf with the authorities in Rome. Insufficiently assured, Vanini decided not return in Italy, and instead cultivated connections with prestigious elements of the French nobility.

In 1616, Vanini completed the second of his two works, ''De Admirandis'', and got it approved by two theologians at the Sorbonne. The work was published in September in Paris. It was dedicated to François de Bassompierre, a powerful man at the court of [[Marie de' Medici]], and was printed by Adrien Périer, a Protestant. The work was immediately successful among those aristocratic circles populated by young spirits who looked with interest to the cultural and scientific innovations that came from Italy. The ''De Admirandis'' was a [[summa]], lively and brilliant, of the new knowledge, and became a kind of "manifesto" for these cultural free spirits, giving Vanini a chance to stay safe in circles close to the French court. However, a few days after the publication of the work, the two theologians at the Sorbonne who had expressed their approval were presented to the Faculty of Theology in formal session and the outcome was a ''de facto'' ban on the movement of the text.

Now, unwelcome in England, unable to return to Italy and threatened by some circles of French Catholics, Vanini saw his room for manoeuvre shrinking and his chances of finding a stable place in French society failing. Fearing that a court case would be started against him in Paris, he fled and went into hiding at [[Redon Abbey]] in Brittany, where Abbott Arthur d'Épinay de Saint-Luc acted as his protector. But other factors gave cause for concern: in April 1617 [[Concino Concini]], favorite of Marie de' Medici, was killed in Paris, giving rise to a wave of hostility to Italian residents at court.

===Final year (1618–1619)===
In the following months, a mysterious Italian, with a strange name (Pompeo Uciglio&lt;ref name="Galileo Project" /&gt;) and in possession of great knowledge but an uncertain past, appeared in some cities of [[Guyenne]], then the [[Languedoc]] and finally [[Toulouse]]. Duke [[Henri II de Montmorency]], protector of ''esprits forts'' of the time, was the governor of this region and seemed to grant protection to the fugitive, who still continued to keep carefully hidden.

The presence of this mysterious character in Toulouse did not however pass unnoticed and attracted the suspicions of the authorities. In August 1618 he was apprehended and interrogated. In February 1619, the Parliament of Toulouse found him guilty of atheism and blasphemy and, in accordance with the regulations of the time, his tongue was cut out, he was strangled and his body was burned. After the execution it emerged that the stranger was in fact Vanini.

==Works==

===''Amphitheatrum''===
''Amphitheatrum Aeternae Providentiae divino-magicum, christiano-physicum, necnon astrologo-catholicum adversus veteres  philosophos, atheos, epicureos, peripateticos et stoicos'' (possible translation: "Amphitheatre of Eternal Providence – Religio-magical, Christian-physical and Astrologico-Catholic – against the Ancient Philosophers, Atheists, Epicureans, Peripatetics and Stoics"), published in Lyon in 1615, consists of 50 exercises, which aim to demonstrate the existence of God, to define His essence, to describe His providence and to examine or refute the opinions of [[Pythagoras]], [[Protagoras]], [[Cicero]], [[Boethius]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], the [[Epicureans]], [[Aristotle]], [[Averroes]], [[Gerolamo Cardano]], the [[Peripatetics]], the [[Stoics]], etc. on this subject.

===''De Admirandis''===
''De Admirandis Naturae Reginae Deaeque Mortalium Arcanis'' (possible translation: "On the Marvelous Secrets of Nature, the Queen and Goddess of Mortals"), printed in Paris in 1616 by publisher Adrien Périer, is divided into four books:

#On Sky and Air
#On Water and Land
#On Animals and Passions
#On Non-Christian Religions

These contain a total of 60 dialogues (but really only 59, as dialogue XXXV is absent), which take place between the author, in the role of disseminator of knowledge, and an imaginary Alessandro, who urges his interlocutor to list and explain the mysteries of nature found around and within man.

In a mixture of reinterpretation of ancient knowledge and the dissemination of new scientific and religious theories, the protagonist discusses: the material, figure, colour, form, energy and eternity of heaven; the motion and the central pole of the heavens; the sun, the moon, the stars; fire; comets and rainbows; lightning, snow and rain; the motion and rest of projectiles in the air; the impulsion of mortars and crossbows; winds and breezes; corrupt airs; the element of water; the birth of the rivers; the rising of the Nile; the extent and saltiness of the sea; the roar and the motion of the water; the motion of projectiles; the creation of islands and mountains, as well as the cause of earthquakes; the genesis, root and colour of the gems, as well as spots of stones; life, food, and the death of the stones; the strength of the magnet to attract iron and its direction toward the Earth's poles; plants; the explanation to be given to certain phenomena of everyday life; semen; the reproduction, nature, respiration and nutrition of fish; the reproduction of birds; the reproduction of bees; the first generation of man; stains contracted by children in the womb; the generation of male and female; parts of monsters; the faces of children covered by larvae; the growth of man; the length of human life; sight; hearing; smell; taste; touch and tickle; the affections of man; God; appearances in the air; oracles; the Sibyls; the possessed; sacred images of the pagans; augurs; the miraculous healing of diseases reported in pagan times; the resurrection of the dead; witchcraft; dreams.

==Thought==
[[Image:Pietro Pomponazzi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pietro Pomponazzi]]
The naturalistic interpretation of supernatural phenomena that [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] – called by Vanini ''magister meus, divinus praeceptor meus, nostri seculi Philosophorum princeps'' – had given in ''De Incantationibus'' was summarised in ''De Admirandis Naturae'', where, in simple and elegant prose, Vanini also referred to [[Cardano]], [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] and other 16th century thinkers.

"God acts on sublunary beings [humans] using the sky as a tool": hence the natural and rational explanation of the allegedly supernatural phenomena, since even astrology was considered a science. God may use such phenomena to warn the people, and especially rulers, of danger. But the real origin of supernatural phenomena is, for Vanini, the human imagination, which can sometimes change the appearance of external reality. For the ecclesiastical "impostors" that promulgate false beliefs to gain wealth and power, and rulers interested in dominating the people, according to Vanini, "all religious things are false and fake principles to teach the naive populace that, when reason cannot be reached, at least practice religion".

Following Pietro Pomponazzi and [[Simone Porzio]] in their interpretation of the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] texts and the commentary thereon by [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], Vanini denied the immortality of the soul and attacked the Aristotelian cosmos-view. Like Bruno, he denied the difference between the everyday world and the celestial world, saying that both are composed of the same corruptible material. He disputed, in the physical and biological world, finality and the hylomorphic Aristotelian doctrine, and, reconnecting [[Epicureanism]] with [[Lucretius]], prepared a new mechanistic-materialistic description of the universe where bodies are likened to a watch, and conceived a first form of universal transformation of living species. He agreed with the Aristotelian eternity of the world, especially considering the temporal aspect, but affirmed the rotation of the earth and appeared to reject the [[Geocentric model#Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic]] system in favour of the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric/Copernican]] system.

If the first editor of his works, Luigi Corvaglia, and historian Guido De Ruggiero, unjustly, considered his writings simply "a ''centone'' devoid of originality and scientific seriousness", the Jesuit priest François Garasse, far more worried about the consequences of the spread of his writings, judged them "a work of such most pernicious atheism as was never released in the last hundred years". The works of Vanini have been extensively reviewed and revalued by contemporary critics, revealing originality and insights (metaphysical, physical, biological) sometimes well ahead of their time.

Since Vanini in his works obscured his ideas, a typical ploy at the time to avoid serious conflicts with the religious and political authorities (conflicts which paradoxically and unfortunately, despite the precautions, led finally to his death), the interpretation of his thought is difficult. However, in the history of philosophy, he has the image of an unbeliever or even an atheist. Considered as one of the fathers of libertinism, he was regarded as a lost soul by conventional Christians, despite having written a defense of the Council of Trent.

To understand the origins of Vanini's thought one has to look to his cultural background, which was fairly typical of the Renaissance, with a prevalence of elements of [[Averroes|Averroistic]] Aristotelianism but with strong elements of mysticism and Neo-Platonism. On the other hand, he drew from [[Nicholas of Cusa]] typical pantheistic elements, similar to those which are also found in [[Giordano Bruno]], but more materialistic. His world view was based on the eternity of matter, and of a God in nature as a "force" that shapes, orders and directs. All forms of life, he thought, had originated spontaneously from the earth itself as their creator.

Vanini was considered an atheist, but his first work, published in Lyon in 1615, ''Amphitheatrum'', indicates otherwise. As a precursor of libertinism there are many elements that make his teaching close to the thought of the unknown author of the [[Treatise of the Three Impostors]], also a pantheist. Vanini thought in fact that the creators of the three monotheistic religions, [[Moses]], [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]], were nothing but impostors.

In ''De Admirandis'' are found themes from ''Amphitheatrum'', with refinements and developments that make it his masterpiece and the summary of his philosophy. Denying creation from nothing and the immortality of the soul, he saw God in Nature as its driving force and vital force, both eternal. The stars of heaven he considered a kind of intermediary between God and Nature. The true religion is therefore a "religion of Nature" that does not deny God but considers Him a spirit-force.

The thought of Vanini is quite fragmented and also reflects the complexity of its origins, as he was a religious figure, a naturalist, but also a doctor and in part a magician. What characterizes the prose is the vehemently anti-clerical sentiment. Among the original aspects of his thinking there is a kind of anticipation of Darwinism, because, after a first half in which he argues that the animal species arise by spontaneous generation from the earth, in the second part he seems convinced that they can be transformed into each other and that man comes from "animals related to man, such as the Barbary apes, the monkeys and apes in general".

==Reputation==
In 1623 two works appeared that started the myth of Vanini the atheist: ''La doctrine curieuse des beaux esprits de ce temps ...'' of Jesuit [[François Garasse]], and ''Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim cum accurata explicatione ...'', of Father [[Marin Mersenne]]. The two works, though, instead of turning off the voice of the philosopher, boosted it in an environment that was obviously ready to receive, discuss and recognise the validity of his claims.

In that same year the name of Vanini was again brought to the attention of French culture during the sensational trial of the poet [[Théophile de Viau]], whose outlook had striking similarities with Vaninian thought.

In 1624, the monk Marin Mersenne returned to attacking the philosophy of Vanini, analyzing some statements in chapter X of his ''L'Impiétè des Déistes, Athées et Libertins de ce temps, combatuë, et renversee de point en point par raisons tirées de la Philosophie, et de la Theologie'', in which the theologian expresses his judgment of the works of Girolamo Cardano and Giordano Bruno.

Even [[Leibniz]], another opponent of libertinism, was strongly opposed to Vanini, considering him evil, a fool and a charlatan.

English intellectuals showed interest in the ideas of Vanini, and it was especially with the work of [[Charles Blount (deist)|Charles Blount]] that Vanini's ideas entered English culture, becoming a cornerstone of libertinism and [[deism]] in seventeenth century England.

An unpublished manuscript in the municipal library of [[Avignon]] preserves ''Observations sur Lucilio Vanini'' written by Joseph Louis Dominique de Cambis, Marquis de Velleron, but provides only uncertain information on the philosopher, largely rectified by recent studies. In this same period a manuscript copy of the ''Amphitheatrum'', was made or commissioned by Joseph Uriot, which later came to the library of the Duke of Württemberg; currently it is in the Württembergische Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart. Another manuscript copy of the same work is in the Staats und Universitätbibliothek in Hamburg, reflecting the continued interest in the thought of Vanini in German culture.

In 1730, the press in London was given a biography of Vanini with an extract of his works, entitled ''The life of Lucilio (alias Julius Caesar) Vanini, burnt for atheism at Toulouse. With an abstract of his writings.'' The work debates Vanini's ideas, recognising much merit.

'''Meta-epistemology''' is a [[metaphilosophical]] study of the subject, matter, [[philosophical method|methods]] and aims of [[epistemology]] and of approaches to understanding and structuring our knowledge of knowledge itself.

In epistemology, there are two basic meta-epistemological approaches: traditional "[[Norm (philosophy)|normative]]" epistemology, and [[naturalized epistemology]].

Traditional epistemology has been concerned with "[[Theory of justification|justification]]". According to the traditional model of knowledge, some proposition ''p'' is knowledge [[if and only if]]:
#some agent X believes ''p'',
#''p'' is true, 
#X is ''justified'' in believing in ''p''

Since the time of [[Descartes]], who sought to establish the criteria by which true beliefs could be acquired, and to determine those beliefs we are in fact justified in believing, the primary epistemological project has been the elucidation of the justificatory condition in the classic tripartite conception of knowledge (i.e. justified true belief).

Naturalized epistemology had its beginnings in the twentieth century with [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]]. Quine's proposal, which is commonly called "Replacement Naturalism," is to excise every trace of normativity from the epistemological body. Quine wanted to merge epistemology with empirical psychology such that every epistemological statement would be replaced by a psychological statement.

==Definition==
Epistemology is the study, or theory of knowledge, including the questions: What is knowledge? How is or should it be acquired, tested, stored, revised, updated, and retrieved?

Some goals of meta-epistemology are to identify inaccurate traditional assumptions, or hitherto overlooked scope for generalization. Thus whereas epistemology has usually been seen as a branch of philosophy, the discussion below also takes examples from biology which seem equivalent in relevant ways. Also, insofar as philosophy ''is'' involved, there may be a case for extending it beyond its traditional domain of word-based definitions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2240">'''Metaknowledge''' or '''meta-knowledge''' is [[knowledge]] about a preselected knowledge.

For the reason of different definitions of knowledge in the subject matter literature, meta-information may or may not be included in meta-knowledge. Detailed cognitive, systemic and [[epistemology|epistemic]] study of human knowledge requires a distinguishing of these concepts.

Meta-knowledge is a fundamental conceptual instrument in such research and scientific domains as, [[knowledge engineering]], [[knowledge management]], and others dealing with study and operations on knowledge, seen as a unified [[object (philosophy)|object]]/entities, abstracted from local conceptualizations and terminologies.
Examples of the first-level individual meta-knowledge are methods of planning, modeling, [[knowledge tags|tagging]], learning and every modification of a [[domain knowledge]]. 
Indeed, universal meta-knowledge frameworks have to be valid for the organization of meta-levels of individual meta-knowledge.

Metaknowledge may be automatically harvested from electronic publication archives, to reveal patterns in research, relationships between researchers and institutions  and to identify contradictory results.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1201765 James A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4395">{{distinguish|Moore's paradox}}
The '''paradox of analysis''' is a paradox that concerns how an [[analysis]] can be both correct and informative.  Although the problem takes its origin from the conflict in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Meno]]'', it was formulated in its complete form by philosopher [[G. E. Moore]] in his book ''[[Principia Ethica]]'', and first named by [[Cooper Harold Langford|C. H. Langford]] in his 1942 article "The Notion of Analysis in Moore's Philosophy".

==The paradox==
A [[conceptual analysis]] is something like the definition of a word.  However, unlike a standard dictionary definition (which may list examples or talk about related terms as well), a completely correct analysis of a concept in terms of others seems like it should have exactly the same meaning as the original concept.  Thus, in order to be correct, the analysis should be able to be used in any context where the original concept is used, without changing the meaning of the discussion in context.  Conceptual analyses of this sort are a major goal of [[analytic philosophy]].

However, if such an analysis is to be useful, it should be informative.  That is, it should tell us something we don't already know (or at least, something one can imagine someone might not already know).  But it seems that no conceptual analysis can both meet the requirement of correctness and of informativeness, on these understandings of the requirements.

To see why, consider a potential simple analysis:

:(1) For all x (any given member of a class or set), x is a brother if and only if x is a male sibling	

One can say that (1) is correct because the expression "brother" represents the same concept as the expression "male sibling," and (1) seems to be informative because the two expressions are not identical.  And if (1) is truly correct, then "brother" and "male sibling" must be interchangeable:

:(2) For all x, x is a brother if and only if x is a brother

Yet (2) is not informative, so either (1) is not informative, or the two expressions used in (1) are not interchangeable (because they change an informative analysis into an uninformative one) so (1) is not actually correct.  In other words, if the analysis is correct and informative, then (1) and (2) must be essentially equal, but this is not true because (2) is not informative.  Therefore, it seems an analysis cannot be both correct and informative at the same time.

==Proposed resolutions==
One way to resolve this paradox is to redefine what is an analysis.  In explaining the paradox, a potential analysis is assumed to be a relation between concepts rather than the verbal expressions used to illustrate them.  If the verbal expression is part of the analysis, then we shouldn't expect complete [[salva veritate|intersubstitutivity]] even in cases of correct analyses.  However, this response seems to move the notion of analysis into mere linguistic definition, rather than doing interesting work with concepts.

Another response is to [[bite the bullet]] and just say that correct analyses are uninformative — which then raises the question of what positive cognitive notion should be used instead of this one, if any.

One further response would be to take [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s position and reject the notion of conceptual analysis altogether. This is a natural response to the rejection of the [[analytic–synthetic distinction]]. The fact that many philosophers have followed Quine in this direction is part of the reason that many now say that the term "analytic philosophy" is a misnomer.

[[File:Parchment from goatskin.jpg|right|thumb|Central European (Northern) type of finished parchment made of [[goatskin (material)|goatskin]] stretched on a wooden frame]]
[[File:קלף, נוצה ודיו.jpg|thumb|Parchment with a quill and ink]]
'''Parchment''' is a writing material made from specially prepared untanned skins of animals—primarily sheep, calves, and goats. It has been used as a writing medium for over two millennia. [[Vellum]] is a finer quality parchment made from the skins of young animals such as lambs and young calves.

It may be called '''animal membrane''' by libraries and museums that wish to avoid distinguishing between "parchment" and the more restricted term vellum (see below).

== Parchment and vellum ==
Today the term "parchment" is often used in non-technical contexts to refer to any animal skin, particularly [[goat]], [[sheep]] or [[cow]], that has been scraped or dried under tension. The term originally referred only to the skin of sheep and, occasionally, goats. The equivalent material made from calfskin, which was of finer quality, was known as [[vellum]] (from the [[Old French]] ''velin'' or ''vellin'', and ultimately from the [[Latin]] ''vitulus'', meaning a calf);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=Roy|title=Conservation of Leather and Related Materials |year=2007 |publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-7506-4881-3|edition=Repr}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the finest of all was "uterine vellum", taken from a calf [[foetus]] or [[stillbirth|stillborn]] calf.

Some authorities have sought to observe these distinctions strictly: for example, [[lexicographer]] [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1755, and master [[calligrapher]] [[Edward Johnston]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Johnston |authorlink=Edward Johnston |year=1906 |title=Writing &amp; Illuminating, &amp; Lettering |place=London |publisher=John Hogg }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when old books and documents are encountered it may be difficult, without scientific analysis, to determine the precise animal origin of a skin either in terms of its species, or in terms of the animal's age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Anthony |last=Cains |chapter=The surface examination of skin: a binder's note on the identification of animal species used in the making of parchment |title=The Book of Kells: proceedings of a conference at Trinity College Dublin, 6–9 September 1992 |editor-first=Felicity |editor-last=O'Mahony |publisher=Scolar Press |place=Aldershot |year=1994 |isbn=0-85967-967-5 |pages=172–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, therefore, there has long been considerable blurring of the boundaries between the different terms. In 1519, [[William Horman]] wrote in his ''Vulgaria'': "That stouffe that we wrytte upon, and is made of beestis skynnes, is somtyme called parchement, somtyme velem, somtyme abortyve, somtyme membraan."&lt;ref&gt;William Horman, ''Vulgaria'' (1519), fol. 80v; cited in Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' (written c. 1599–1602) the following exchange occurs:
{{quote|''Hamlet.'' Is not parchment made of sheepskins?&lt;br /&gt;
''Horatio.'' Ay, my lord, and of calves' skins too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Shakecite|Ham|M|5|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lee Ustick, writing in 1936, commented that:
{{quote|To-day the distinction, among collectors of manuscripts, is that ''vellum'' is a highly refined form of skin, ''parchment'' a cruder form, usually thick, harsh, less highly polished than vellum, but with no distinction between skin of calf, or sheep, or of goat.&lt;ref&gt;Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is for these reasons that many modern [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]], [[librarian]]s and [[archivist]]s prefer to use either the broader term "parchment", or the neutral term "animal membrane".&lt;ref&gt;Stokes and Almagno 2001, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Permennter-1568.png|thumb|upright|German parchmenter, 1568]]

The word parchment evolved (via the Latin ''pergamenum'' and the French ''parchemin'') from the name of the city of [[Pergamon]] which was a thriving center of parchment production during the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/443382/parchment |title=parchment (writing material) |work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |year=2012 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705155624/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/443382/parchment |archive-date=2012-07-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city so dominated the trade that a legend later arose which said that parchment had been invented in Pergamon to replace the use of [[papyrus]] which had become monopolized by the rival city of [[Alexandria]]. This account, originating in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder]] (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', Book XII, 69–70), is dubious because parchment had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Peter |title=Alexander to Actium: the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age |place=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1990 |isbn=0520056116 |page=168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] mentions writing on skins as common in his time, the 5th century BC; and in his ''Histories'' (v.58) he states that the Ionians of Asia Minor had been accustomed to give the name of ''skins'' (''diphtherai'') to books; this word was adapted by Hellenized Jews to describe scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/parchmen.html |title=Parchment |author=Meir Bar-Ilan |website=Bar-Ilan University – Faculty Members Homepages |access-date=2005-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050422080330/http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/parchmen.html |archive-date=2005-04-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd century BC, [[Library of Pergamum|a great library]] was set up in Pergamon that rivaled the famous [[Library of Alexandria]]. As prices rose for papyrus and the reed used for making it was over-harvested towards local extinction in the two [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] of the [[Nile delta]] that produced it, Pergamon adapted by increasing use of parchment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abaa.org/blog/post/the-history-of-vellum-and-parchment|title=The History Of Vellum And Parchment {{!}} The New Antiquarian {{!}} The Blog of The Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America|last=|first=|date=|website=www.abaa.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830081534/https://www.abaa.org/Blog/post/the-history-of-vellum-and-parchment|archive-date=30 August 2017|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Writing on prepared animal skins had a long history, however. [[David Diringer]] noted that "the first mention of Egyptian documents written on leather goes back to the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (c. 2550–2450 BC), but the earliest of such documents extant are: a fragmentary roll of leather of the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (c. 24th century BC), unrolled by Dr. H. Ibscher, and preserved in the [[Cairo Museum]]; a roll of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] (c. 1990–1777 BC) now in Berlin; the mathematical text now in the [[British Museum]] (MS. 10250); and a document of the reign of [[Ramses II]] (early thirteenth century BC)."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Diringer]], ''The Book before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental'', Dover Publications, New York 1982, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Assyria]]ns and the [[Babylonians]] impressed their [[cuneiform]] on clay tablets, they also wrote on parchment from the 6th century BC onward. [[Rabbinic literature]] traditionally maintains that the institution of employing parchment made of animal hides for the writing of ritual objects such as the [[Torah]], [[mezuzah]], and [[tefillin]] is [[Revelation at Sinai|Sinaitic]] in origin, with special designations for different types of parchment such as [[gevil]] and [[klaf]].&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Hilkhoth Tefillin 1:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Islamic texts are also found on parchment.

In the later [[Middle Ages]], especially the 15th century, parchment was largely replaced by [[paper]] for most uses except luxury manuscripts, some of which were also on paper. New techniques in paper milling allowed it to be much cheaper than parchment; it was made of textile rags and of very high quality. With the advent of [[printing]] in the later fifteenth century, the demands of printers far exceeded the supply of animal skins for parchment.

[[File:NLW Penrice and Margam Deeds 204 front (8634702372).jpg|thumb|left|Latin [[Grant (money)|grant]] written on fine parchment or [[vellum]] with [[seal (device)|seal]] dated 1329]]

There was a short period during the introduction of printing where parchment and paper were used at the same time, with parchment (in fact vellum) the more expensive luxury option, preferred by rich and conservative customers. Although most copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] are on paper, some were printed on parchment; 12 of the 48 surviving copies, with most incomplete. In 1490, [[Johannes Trithemius]] preferred the older methods, because "handwriting placed on parchment will be able to endure a thousand years. But how long will printing last, which is dependent on paper? For if ... it lasts for two hundred years that is a long time."&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in David McKitterick, ''Print, Manuscript, and the Search for Order'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In fact high quality paper from this period has survived 500 years or more very well, if kept in reasonable library conditions.

The heyday of parchment use was during the medieval period, but there has been a growing revival of its use among artists since the late 20th century. Although parchment never stopped being used (primarily for governmental documents and diplomas) it had ceased to be a primary choice for artist's supports by the end of 15th century [[Renaissance]]. This was partly due to its expense and partly due to its unusual working properties. Parchment consists mostly of [[collagen]]. When the water in paint media touches parchment's surface, the collagen melts slightly, forming a raised bed for the paint, a quality highly prized by some artists.
[[File:Sachsenspiegel.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A 1385 copy of the [[Sachsenspiegel]], a German legal code, written on parchment with straps and clasps on the binding]]
Parchment is also extremely affected by its environment and changes in humidity, which can cause buckling. Books with parchment pages were bound with strong wooden boards and clamped tightly shut by metal (often brass) clasps or leather straps;&lt;ref name="pul" /&gt; this acted to keep the pages pressed flat despite humidity changes. Such metal fittings continued to be found on books as decorative features even after the use of paper made them unnecessary.&lt;ref name="pul"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/hb/cases/closures/index.html |title=Clasps, Furniture, and Other Closures |author= |year=2004 |work=Hand Bookindings |publisher=Princeton University Library |accessdate=4 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208042037/http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/hb/cases/closures/index.html |archive-date=2011-12-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary artists prize the changeability of parchment, noting that the material seems alive and like an active participant in making artwork. To support the needs of the revival of use by artists, a revival in the art of preparing individual skins is also underway. Hand-prepared skins are usually preferred by artists because they are more uniform in surface and have fewer oily spots which can cause long-term cracking of paint than mass-produced parchment, which is usually made for lamp shades, furniture, or other interior design purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of current artists using parchment see:

The [[radiocarbon dating]] techniques that are used on papyrus can be applied to parchment as well. They do not date the age of the writing but the preparation of the parchment itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santos|first1=F.J.|last2=Gomez-Martinez|first2=I.|last3=Garcia-Leon|first3=M.|title=Radiocarbon dating of medieval manuscripts from the University of Seville|url=http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/75115/4/Radiocarbon%20dating.pdf|format=PDF|website=[[Digital.csic.es]]|access-date=2015-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102317/http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/75115/4/Radiocarbon%20dating.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is feasibly possible also to radio carbon date certain kinds of ink, it is extremely difficult to do due to the fact that they are generally present on the text only in trace amounts, and it is hard to get a carbon sample of them without the carbon in the parchment contaminating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stolte|first=D.|year=2011|title=UA experts determine age of book 'nobody can read'|url=http://uanews.org/story/ua-experts-determine-age-book-nobody-can-read|website=www.uanews.org|access-date=2015-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404164910/http://uanews.org/story/ua-experts-determine-age-book-nobody-can-read|archive-date=2015-04-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacture ==
Parchment is prepared from pelt&amp;nbsp;– i.e. wet, unhaired, and limed skin&amp;nbsp;– by drying at ordinary temperatures under tension, most commonly on a wooden frame known as a stretching frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reed |first=Ronald |title=Ancient Skins Parchments and Leathers |year=1972 |publisher=Seminar Press |place=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flaying, soaking, and dehairing ===
After being flayed, the skin is soaked in water for about a day. This removes blood and grime from the skin and prepares it for a dehairing liquor.&lt;ref name='reed75'&gt;Reed, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The dehairing liquor was originally made of rotted, or fermented, vegetable matter, like beer or other liquors, but by the [[Middle Ages]] an unhairing bath included [[lime (mineral)|lime]]. Today, the lime solution is occasionally sharpened by the use of sodium sulfide. The liquor bath would have been in wooden or stone vats and the hides stirred with a long wooden pole to avoid human contact with the [[alkaline]] solution. Sometimes the skins would stay in the unhairing bath for eight or more days depending how concentrated and how warm the solution was kept—unhairing could take up to twice as long in winter. The vat was stirred two or three times a day to ensure the solution's deep and uniform penetration. Replacing the lime water bath also sped the process up. However, if the skins were soaked in the liquor too long, they would be weakened and not able to stand the stretching required for parchment.&lt;ref name='reed75' /&gt;

=== Stretching ===
After soaking in water to make the skins workable, the skins were placed on a stretching frame. A simple frame with nails would work well in stretching the pelts. The skins could be attached by wrapping small, smooth rocks in the skins with rope or leather strips. Both sides would be left open to the air so they could be scraped with a sharp, [[blade#Patterns of knife blades|semi-lunar knife]] to remove the last of the hair and get the skin to the right thickness. The skins, which were made almost entirely of [[collagen]], would form a natural glue while drying and once taken off the frame they would keep their form. The stretching aligned the fibres to be more nearly parallel to the surface.

== Treatments ==
{{See also|Purple parchment}}
To make the parchment more aesthetically pleasing or more suitable for the [[scribe]]s, special treatments were used. According to Reed there were a variety of these treatments. Rubbing [[pumice]] powder into the flesh side of parchment while it was still wet on the frame was used to make it smooth and to modify the surface to enable inks to penetrate more deeply. Powders and pastes of calcium compounds were also used to help remove grease so the ink would not run. To make the parchment smooth and white, thin pastes (starchgrain or staunchgrain) of lime, flour, egg whites and milk were rubbed into the skins.&lt;ref&gt;See for example recipes in the [[Secretum Philosophorum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meliora di Curci in her paper "The History and Technology of Parchment Making" notes that parchment was not always white. "[[Cennino Cennini|Cennini]], a 15th century craftsman provides recipes to tint parchment a variety of colours including purple, indigo, green, red and peach." The Early medieval [[Codex Argenteus]] and [[Codex Vercellensis]], the [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]] and the [[Codex Brixianus]] give a range of luxuriously produced manuscripts all on [[purple vellum]], in imitation of Byzantine examples, like the [[Rossano Gospels]], [[Sinope Gospels]] and the [[Vienna Genesis]], which at least at one time are believed to have been reserved for Imperial commissions.

Many techniques for [[parchment repair]] exist, to restore creased, torn, or incomplete parchments.

=== Reuse ===
{{Main|Palimpsest}}
During the seventh through the ninth centuries, many earlier parchment manuscripts were scrubbed and scoured to be ready for rewriting, and often the earlier writing can still be read. These recycled parchments are called [[palimpsest]]s. Later, more thorough techniques of scouring the surface irretrievably lost the earlier text.

== Jewish parchment ==
[[File:Torah and jad.jpg|thumb|right|A ''Sefer [[Torah]]'', the traditional form of the [[Hebrew Bible]], is a scroll of parchment.]]
{{See also|Gevil|Klaf|Duchsustus}}
The way in which parchment was processed (from hide to parchment) has undergone a tremendous evolution based on time and location. Parchment and vellum are not the sole methods of preparing animal skins for writing. In the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Bava Batra]] 14B) Moses writes the first Torah Scroll on the unsplit cow-hide called ''[[gevil]]''.

Parchment is still the only medium used by traditional [[religious]] [[Jews]] for [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] or [[tefilin]] and [[mezuzah]]s, and is produced by large companies in [[Israel]]. For those uses, only hides of [[kosher]] animals are permitted. Since there are many requirements for it being fit for the religious use, the liming is usually processed under supervision of a qualified [[Rabbi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccdesigninc.com/MishmeresStam/Leaflet.pdf |format=PDF |title=Information Leaflet by Vaad Mishmereth Staam |website=CC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410134250/http://www.ccdesigninc.com/MishmeresStam/Leaflet.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional uses of the term ==
In some universities, the word parchment is still used to refer to the certificate (scroll) presented at graduation ceremonies, even though the modern document is printed on paper or thin card; although doctoral graduates may be given the option of having their scroll written by a calligrapher on vellum. The [[University of Notre Dame]] still uses animal parchment for its [[diploma]]s. Similarly, [[University of Glasgow]] and [[Heriot-Watt University]] use goat skin parchment for their degrees.

=== Plant-based parchment ===
{{See also|Parchment paper (baking)}}
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
'''Vegetable (paper) parchment''' is made by passing a waterleaf (an unsized paper like blotters) made of pulp fibers into [[sulfuric acid]]. The sulfuric acid hydrolyses and solubilises the main natural organic polymer, cellulose, present in the pulp wood fibers. The paper web is then washed in water, which stops the hydrolysis of the cellulose and causes a kind of cellulose coating to form on the waterleaf. The final paper is dried. This coating is a natural non-porous cement, that gives to the vegetable parchment paper its resistance to grease and its semi-translucency.

Other processes can be used to obtain grease-resistant paper, such as waxing the paper or using [[fluorine]]-based chemicals. Highly beating the fibers gives an even more translucent paper with the same grease resistance. Silicone and other coatings may also be applied to the parchment. A [[silicone]]-coating treatment produces a cross-linked material with high density, stability and heat resistance and low surface tension which imparts good anti-stick or release properties. [[Chromium]] salts can also be used to impart moderate anti-stick properties.

== Parchment craft ==
{{Main|Parchment craft}}
Historians believe that parchment craft originated as an art form in Europe during the fifteenth or sixteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Parchment craft at that time occurred principally in Catholic communities, where crafts persons created lace-like items such as devotional pictures and communion cards. The craft developed over time, with new techniques and refinements being added. Until the sixteenth century, parchment craft was a European art form. However, missionaries and other settlers relocated to South America, taking parchment craft with them. As before, the craft appeared largely among the Catholic communities. Often, young girls receiving their first communion received gifts of handmade parchment crafts.

Although the invention of the printing press led to a reduced interest in hand made cards and items, by the eighteenth century, people were regaining interest in detailed handwork. Parchment cards became larger in size and crafters began adding wavy borders and perforations. In the nineteenth century, influenced by French romanticism, parchment crafters began adding floral themes and cherubs and hand embossing.

Parchment craft today involves various techniques, including tracing a pattern with white or colored ink, embossing to create a raised effect, stippling, perforating, coloring and cutting. Parchment craft appears in hand made cards, as scrapbook embellishments, as bookmarks, lampshades, decorative small boxes, wall hangings and more.

== DNA testing ==
An article published in 2009 by Timothy L. Stinson considered the possibilities of tracing the origin of medieval parchment manuscripts and codices through [[DNA]] analysis. The methodology would employ [[polymerase chain reaction]] to replicate a small DNA sample to a size sufficiently large for testing. A 2006 study had revealed the genetic signature of several Greek manuscripts to have "goat-related sequences". It might be possible to use these techniques to determine whether related library materials were made from genetically related animals (perhaps from the same herd).&lt;ref&gt;Stinson 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Persecution of Sufis''' and [[Sufism]] has included destruction of Sufi shrines and mosques, suppression of orders, murder, and discrimination against adherents in a number of Muslim-majority countries. The Turkish Republican state banned all Sufi orders and abolished their institutions in 1925 after Sufis opposed the new secular order. The Iranian Islamic Republic has harassed Shia Sufis, reportedly for their lack of support for the government doctrine of "[[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist|governance of the jurist]]" (i.e., that the supreme [[Shiite]] jurist should be the nation's political leader). 

In most other Muslim countries, attacks on Sufis and especially their shrines have come from adherents of puritanical schools of thought who believe that practices such as [[Mawlid#Other uses of the term|celebration of the birthdays of Sufi saints]], and [[dhikr]] ("remembrance" of God) ceremonies are [[bid‘ah]] or impure innovation, and polytheistic ([[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]]).&lt;ref name="ibrahim"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/may/10/islam-sufi-salafi-egypt-religion Salafi intolerance threatens Sufis] |Baher Ibrahim |guardian.co.uk |10 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mir&gt;{{cite web|last=Mir|first=Tariq|title=Kashmir: From Sufi to Salafi|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/kashmir-sufi-resurgence-salafi-islam-belief-conflict-rising-salafism-muslim-islam|work=November 5, 2012|publisher=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=violence/&gt;

[[File:'Ali Dede al-Busnawi - Three Hundred Sixty Sufi Questions - Walters W585 - Closed Top View A.jpg|thumb|right|Ali Dede the Bosnian's book ''Three Hundred Sixty Sufi Questions'']]
During the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Iran, "both the wandering dervishes of 'low' Sufism" and "the philosopher-ulama of 'high' Sufism came under relentless pressure" from powerful cleric [[Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi]] (d. 1110/1699).

{{quote|Before the [[World War I|first world war]] there were almost 100,000 disciples of the Mevlevi order throughout the Ottoman empire. But in 1925, as part of his desire to create a modern, western-orientated, secular state, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] banned all the different Sufi orders and closed their tekkes. Pious foundations were suspended and their endowments expropriated; Sufi hospices were closed and their contents seized; all religious titles were abolished and [[dervish]] clothes outlawed.

In recent years, shrines, and sometimes mosques, have been damaged or destroyed in many parts of the Muslim world. Some Sufi adherents have been killed as well.

===Egypt===
A May 2010 ban by the ministry of awqaf (religious endowments) of centuries old Sufi [[dhikr]] gatherings (devoted to the remembrance of God, and including dancing and religious songs) has been described as a "another victory for extreme Salafi thinking at the expense of Egypt's moderate Sufism".

According to Gaber Qassem, deputy of the Sufi Orders, approximately 14 shrines have been violated in Egypt since the January 2011 revolution. According to Sheikh Tarek El-Rifai, head of the Rifai Sufi Order, a number of Salafis have prevented Sufi prayers in Al-Haram. Sheikh Rifai said that the order's lawyer has filed a report at the Al-Haram police station to that effect. In early April 2011, a Sufi march from Al-Azhar Mosque to Al-Hussein Mosque was followed by a massive protest before Al-Hussein Mosque, "expressing outrage at the destruction" of Sufi shrines. The Islamic Research Centre of Egypt, led by Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Ahmed El-Tayeb, has also denounced the attacks on the shrines.&lt;ref name=violence&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamopediaonline.org/country-profile/egypt/salafists/salafi-violence-against-sufis|title=Salafi Violence against Sufis|publisher=[[Islamopedia Online]]|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Muslim Brotherhood website ikhwanweb.com, in 2011 "a memorandum was submitted to the Armed Forces" citing 20 "encroachments" on Sufi shrines.&lt;ref name=ikhwanweb/&gt;

Said Atsayev—also known as Sheikh Said Afandi al-Chirkavi—a prominent 74-year-old Sufi Muslim spiritual leader in Dagestan Russia, was killed by a suicide bombing August 28, 2012 along with six of his followers. His murder follows "similar religiously motivated killings" in Dagestan and regions of ex-Soviet Central Asia, targeting religious leaders—not necessarily Sufi—who disapprove of violent jihad.

Several books were published arguing that because Sufis follow their own spiritual leaders they do not believe in the Islamic state's theocratic principle of the [[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist|governance of the jurist]] and should therefore be treated as second-class citizens, not allowed to have government jobs, or be fired if they do.&lt;ref name=attack&gt;{{cite web|last=Esfandiari|first=Golnaz|title=Wednesday, February 27, 2013 Features Sufism Under Attack In Iran|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Sufism_Under_Attack_In_Iran/1499990.html|work=February 27, 2013|publisher=rferl.org|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the [[Ni'matullāhī]] order—Iran's largest Sufi order—has come under increasing state pressure. Three of its [[khanqah]]s have been demolished. Officials accused it of not having building permits and of narcotics possession—charges which the Sufis reject.&lt;ref name=attack/&gt;

It also reports:
{{Quote|
In February 2009, at least 40 Sufis in [[Isfahan]] were arrested after protesting the destruction of a Sufi place of worship; all were released within days.

In January, Jamshid Lak, a Gonabadi Dervish from the Nematollahi Sufi order was flogged 74 times after being convicted in 2006 of slander following his public allegation of ill-treatment by a Ministry of Intelligence official.

In late December 2008, after the closure of a Sufi place of worship, authorities arrested without charge at least six members of the Gonabadi Dervishes on [[Kish Island]] and confiscated their books and computer equipment; their status is unknown.

In November 2008, Amir Ali Mohammad Labaf was sentenced to a five-year prison term, 74 lashes, and internal exile to the southeastern town of [[Babak, Hormozgan|Babak]] for spreading lies, based on his membership in the Nematollahi Gonabadi Sufi order.

In October, at least seven Sufi Muslims in Isfahan, and five others in [[Karaj]], were arrested because of their affiliation with the Nematollahi Gonabadi Sufi order; they remain in detention.

In November 2007, clashes in the western city of [[Borujerd]] between security forces and followers of a mystic Sufi order resulted in dozens of injuries and the arrests of approximately 180 Sufi Muslims. The clashes occurred after authorities began bulldozing a Sufi monastery. It is unclear how many remain in detention or if any charges have been brought against those arrested. During the past year, there were numerous reports of Shi'a clerics and prayer leaders, particularly in [[Qom]], denouncing Sufism and the activities of Sufi Muslims in the country in both sermons and public statements.&lt;ref name="USCoIRF"/&gt;}}

In 2009 the mausoleum of the 19th century Sufi poet Nasir Ali and an adjoining Sufi prayer house were bulldozed.&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=Stephen|title=Iran Continues Crackdown on Sufis|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-schwartz/iran-continues-crackdown-on-sufis_b_3181642.html|work=04/30/2013|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=6 May 2014|date=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Sufis in Iran have been subject to government pressure. Sunni dervish orders—such as the Qhaderi dervishes—in the Sunni-populated parts of the country are thought by some to be seen as allies of the government against Al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=attack/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4120">'''Philip Paul Hallie''' (1922–1994) was an author, philosopher and professor at [[Wesleyan University]] for 32 years. During [[World War II]] he served in the [[US Army]]. His degrees were from [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (where he was a [[Rhodes Scholar]] at [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]] from 1949 to 1951)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E7DD1730F933A2575BC0A962958260|title=Philip P. Hallie, 72, Professor and Writer|work=[[New York Times]]|date=August 10, 1994|accessdate=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grinnell College]].

He developed the model of [[institutional cruelty]].

==Institutional cruelty==
''Institutional cruelty'' is a model developed by Philip Hallie, who believes ethics are rooted in passion and common sense rather than in technical science.

Hallie defines "institutional cruelty" as a persistent pattern of humiliation that endures for years in a community, but the victimizer and the victim find ways to downplay the harm that is being done. Both the victim and the victimizer justify cruel actions based on what they have been led to believe is "actual" inferiority.  Hallie argues that cruelty is created by an imbalance of power, or hierarchy. According to his view, the opposite of institutionalized cruelty is freedom from the cruel relationship, not just kindness.

Institutional cruelty demotes individuality. "Commitment [to an institution] that overrides all sentimentality transforms cruelty and destruction into moral nobility, and commitment is the lifeblood of an institution," (Hallie "From Cruelty to Goodness" 7).

==Published works==
Hallie's work generally explores the nature of ethics—good and evil, cruelty and kindness. His writing and statements have made particular reference to the admiration he holds for members of the [[French Resistance]] at [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallie, Philip. ''In the Eye of the Hurricane: Tales of Good and Evil, Help and Harm''. Wesleyan University, 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5DG8oaLGGTYC Google Book Search]. 31 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Tales of Good and Evil, Help and Harm'' (1997)
* ''In the Eye of the Hurricane: Tales of Good and Evil, Help and Harm'' (2001)
* ''From Cruelty to Goodness''

In "From Cruelty to Goodness" he defines cruelty by what it depends upon to exist. He explains that all cruelty derives from a deficit in power. Examples are used such as Nazi concentration camps and slavery. "The power of the majority and the weakness of a minority were at the center of institutional cruelty of slavery and Nazi anti-Semitism." He also emphasizes that deep humiliation in institutionalized cruelty can be just as hurtful to the victim as episodic cruelty, cruelty where both the victim and the victimizer are aware of the harm being committed.
He then goes on to purport that the redress of stopping cruelty isn't enough to negate or perfectly oppose cruelty. Hospitality is the only cure for cruelty. "It lies in unsentimental, efficacious love."&lt;ref&gt;Hallie, Philip. "From Cruelty to Goodness" in Christina Sommers &amp; Fred Sommers, ''Vice and Virtue in Everyday Life'', Harcourt College Publishers (2001) pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This is described as not only "being your brothers keeper" (protecting the weak), but also as staying true to the "negative injunctions against killing and betraying."

[[Image:New 2000 black percent.gif|thumb|275px|right|The proposed territory centers on areas where the highest percentage of the population classified as black lives in the US (2000).]]

The '''Republic of New Afrika''' ('''RNA'''), founded in 1968 as the Republic of New Africa (RNA), is a [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] organization and [[Black separatism|black separatist]] movement popularized by [[Black supremacy|black supremacist]] groups in the [[United States]]. The larger New Afrika movement in particular has three goals:

* Creation of an independent [[African-American|Black]]-majority country situated in the [[southeastern United States|Southeastern region]], in the heart of an area of black-majority population.
* Payment by the federal government of several billion dollars in [[Reparations for slavery|reparations]] to African-American descendants of slaves for the damages inflicted on Africans and their descendants by [[Slavery|chattel enslavement]], [[Jim Crow laws]], and modern-day forms of [[Racism in the United States|racism]].
* A [[referendum]] of all African Americans to determine their desires for citizenship; movement leaders say they were not offered a choice in this matter after emancipation in 1865 following the American Civil War.

The vision for this country was first promulgated by the Malcolm X Society&lt;ref name="Mjagkij"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=56KH2aisL_UC&amp;pg=PA277&amp;lpg=PA277&amp;dq=black+government+conference+1968+detroit#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20government%20conference%201968%20detroit&amp;f=false|title=Organizing Black America|last=Mjagkij|first=Nina|date=2013-05-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135581231|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; on March 31, 1968, at a Black Government Conference held in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The conference participants drafted a constitution and declaration of independence.&lt;ref name="Mjagkij"/&gt; Its proponents{{who|date=November 2014}} lay claim to five Southern states: [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[South Carolina]]; and to the black-majority [[County (United States)|counties]] adjacent to this area in [[Arkansas]], [[Texas]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackpast.org/aah/republic-new-africa-1968&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Black Government Conference was convened by the [[Malcolm X Society]] and the [[Group on Advanced Leadership]] (GOAL), two influential [[Detroit]]-based black organizations with broad followings. The attendees produced a Declaration of Independence (signed by 100 conferees out of approximately 500), a constitution, and the framework for a [[provisional government]]. [[Robert F. Williams]], a controversial human rights advocate then living in exile in China, was chosen as the first president of the provisional government; attorney [[Milton Henry]] (a student of [[Malcolm X]]'s teachings) was named first vice president; and [[Betty Shabazz]], widow of Malcolm X, served as second vice president.

The Provisional Government of the Republic of New Afrika (PG-RNA) advocated/advocates a form of cooperative economics through the building of New Communities—named after the [[Ujamaa]] concept promoted by Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]]. It proposed militant self-defense through the building of local people's militias and a standing army to be called the Black Legion; and the building of racially based organizations to champion the right of [[self-determination]] for people of black African descent.

The organization was involved in numerous controversial issues. For example, it attempted to assist [[Oceanhill-Brownsville]] area in Brooklyn to secede from the United States during the [[New York City teachers' strike of 1968|1968 conflict]] over control of public schools. Additionally, it was involved with shootouts at New Bethel Baptist Church in 1969 (&lt;!-- where? --&gt;during the one-year anniversary of the founding) and another in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], in 1971. (It had announced that the capital of the Republic would be in Hinds County, Mississippi, located on a member's farm.) In the confrontations, law-enforcement officials were killed and injured. Organization members were prosecuted for the crimes.&lt;!-- More detail, explain --&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) listed the Republic of New Afrika as a [[Sedition|seditious]] group due to its advocacy of [[secession]]. It conducted raids on its meetings, which led to violent confrontations. It repeatedly arrested and prosecuted certain RNA leaders noted above. The group was a target of the [[COINTELPRO]] operation by the FBI, as well as [[Red Squad]] activities of [[Michigan State Police]] and the [[Detroit Police Department]], among other cities.

==Early life and education==

He has worked as a lecturer in several universities in [[Tehran]], including Allameh Tabataba'i University. He was also an interpreter at several bilingual philosophical conferences, such as “International Conference on Religious Epistemology”, “International Conference on Mulla Sadra &amp; Transcendent Philosophy” and “International Conference on Two Hundred Years after Kant.” He has worked as a researcher, translator, and interpreter for Iranian philosophical institutes like “Institute for Humanities and Cultural Studies”, “Iranian Institute of Philosophy,” and “Sadra Islamic Philosophy Institute.” Now, he is a [[faculty member]] and [[assistant professor]] of department of philosophy at Imam Khomeini International University (IKIU), [[Qazvin]], [[Iran]]. He has published more than 20 books and research papers, including The Limits of Morality (Tehran, Ney, 2012), An Analysis and Critique of Classical and Modern Types of Utilitarianism (Tehran, Negah-e Mo’aser, 2015), and Persian translation of [[Julia Driver]]’s Consequentialism (Tehran, Hekmat, 2015), and [[Jack Russell Weinstein|J. R. Weinstein]]’s On [[Adam Smith]] (Tehran, IHCS, 2013). His expertise, research interests, and (Persian, English, and Russian) publications are focused in the areas of moral, political and legal philosophy; harm and liberty-limiting principles, comparative analysis between [[pre-Islamic Iran]]ian teachings, Western philosophies and philosophers; comparative analysis between Islamic ethics and jurisprudence and Western moral philosophy; and comparative analysis between the main after-Islamic Iranian philosophical traditions – esp. The Peripatetic School, the Illumination School and the Transcendent Philosophy - and Western philosophies and philosophers. He has taught students in these areas of expertise and has a particular interest in developing his theory entitled “the moral permissibility of subjective harm” for establishing peace and tolerance in the world – esp, in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Analysis and critique of moral theories of utilitarianism|url=http://www.mehrnews.com/news/2149471/%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%84-%D9%88-%D9%86%D9%82%D8%AF-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82%DB%8C-%D9%81%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AF%D9%87-%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1|accessdate=14 March 2017|agency=[[Mehr News Agency]]|language=fa|date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shirzad Peik Herfeh is an Iranian [[philosopher]], [[intellectual]], moral, political, and legal theorist. Also an author, translator and a [[university professor]]. He is best known for his theories for “peace” and “tolerance” in the world and in the [[Middle East]], such as “The Moral Permissibility of Subjective Harms as a Base for Peace &amp; Tolerance”, “A New Synthetic Model as a Refinement for the Do/Allow Distinction”, “An Appeal to Mysticism for Solving the Problem of Fanaticism”, “The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law;” and his own “Harm Principle” in which he criticizes J. S. Mill’s “Harm Principle,” analyzes different kinds of “harm” and categorizes them into two different categories: “subjective” &amp; “objective.” He is also against “Legal Moralism” and “Legal Paternalism.”
Peik Herfeh is also known for introducing the newest and hottest theories in moral, political, and legal philosophy to Persian-speaking and [[Muslim world]], and his Persian translations of English books and papers including Julia Driver’s Consequentialism and Jack Russell Weinstein’s On Adam Smith.
He is also the manager of “IPA: Iranian Philosophers Association” in which he tries to criticize what he calls [[Pop philosophy]] and open a third front for philosophy in Iran as well as “Academic Philosophy” and “Pop Philosophy.”
Peik Herfeh has taught philosophy for many years in Iran. Now, he is a faculty member in the department of philosophy at [[Imam Khomeini International University]] (IKIU). Peik Herfeh has also written a variety of articles from [[Zoroastrianism|Iranian Zoroastrian]] pre-Islamic and post-Islamic thoughts to Western Philosophy. 
His first Persian book entitled “The Borders of Ethics” (Persian: مرزهای اخلاق‎‎) has been the “award winner” of the 20th Book of the Season Award in the Islamic Republic of Iran. It has been published in 2012 by Ney publication, the best Iranian publication in humanities and social sciences. His last Persian book entitled “The Origins and Different Types of Classical &amp; Modern Utilitarianism” has been published by Nashr-e Negah-e Mo’aser. In this very book, he tries to find a reasonable answer for a variety of questions about “utilitarianism,” such as: 
#  Are the values that should figure in determining which option is the best, ‘the values of what would be the case were the agent to carry out the option’ or ‘the values that are possible for the agent in an ideal situation’?
#  Is the moral quality of a feature of agency determined by ‘actual consequences’ or by what the agent ‘expects’ or ‘intends’ to be brought about by her actions?
#  Is ‘the greatest good principle’ a criterion for evaluating ‘all features of agency’ or just agent’s ‘actions’? 
#  Is the right action what ‘maximizes the good’ or what ‘satisfices the good’?
#  Which one is the sole intrinsic good: ‘pleasure’ or ‘preference’?

His father then married Giribala Devi, and himself died in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sanjib|last=Chattopadhyay |title='Sri Sri Sitaramdas Omkarnath Shivthakurer kache ki Mantra peyechilen'  |page=12 |newspaper=[[Bartaman]] Patrika (Bengali: বর্তমান) |date=19 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Omkarnath attended a village school but then determined that Dasarathidev Yogeswar of Digsui village should be his [[guru]].&lt;ref name="Omkar Math Omkareshwar"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gurus&gt;{{cite book |last=Singh Uban |first=Sujan |title=Gurus of India |year=1977 |publisher=East-West Publications (U.K.) Ltd |page= |isbn=978-0-85692-004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133}}Though he was admitted to the Bandel Church School for a quite of time to pursue Western Education, he left that school for is earnest interest in Indian Sankritised Education system.  Thereafter he studied at Yogeswar's house, where he undertook daily chores as well as spiritual education. In 1918, Probodh was  meditating at about midnight when he visualised the god [[Shiva]] along with the [[Durga|Durga, the Divine Mother]].&lt;ref name="THE MOUNTAIN PATH"&gt;{{cite journal| title=THAKUR SRI SRI SITARAMDAS OMKARNATH MAHARAJ  BY PROF. S. BANERJEE| url=http://www.ramana-maharshi.info/m_path/1965_3/july_1965_frameset.htm|  accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Omkarnath visualised his previous birth on the day of [[Saraswati]] [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]. Through this he came to believe that he was a famous worshipper of the goddess [[Kali]] in previous life.&lt;ref name="The Mother Divine"&gt;{{cite web |title=Impression of Sri Sitaramdas Omkarnath|url= http://www.themotherdivine.com/sponsor_founder.shtml |accessdate=2015-05-26 |publisher=[The Mother Divine]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual quest==
Guru Dasarathidev had named him ''Sitaram'', the name ''Omkarnath'' was a divine revelation which was later formally conferred by Swami Dhruvananda Giri. Thus, Probodh came to be known as Sitaramdas Omkarnath. He had heard the ''Hare Krishna'' [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|MahaMantra]] as a Divine Sound during his austere meditation in a cave at Ramashram, Dumurdaha, Hooghly. Later, he heard a divine voice say "O Sage, dive in". Still Sitaram was not ready for giving spiritual initiation to masses, and he waited for direct command. At [[Puri]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], Sitaram visualised [[Jagannath]] in a halo &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pather Alo- Thakur |url=http://patheralo.org/aboutus.html|accessdate=2015-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jagannath gave the instruction — "Go, Go, Go and give the Name".&lt;ref name="Gurus"/&gt;{{rp|134}} Thereafter, Sitaram started spreading the Lord's name on a mass scale.&lt;ref name="Gurus"/&gt;{{rp|136}}

== As a preacher/guru==
After getting the alleged Divine instruction, Omkarnath began to preach Nam all across India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kinkar |last=Viththal Ramanuja|title=Mahapurusder Tirtho Bhraman |publisher= Sukhi Grihakon(Bengali: সুখী গৃহকোণ )  |date= 1 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; . Temples were established and renovated, the poor were fed, clothes were distributed, help was given to the fathers of marriageable daughters, taking on the responsibility of lifetime maintenance of hundreds of poverty-stricken families, establishment of free schools for poor students, setting up 29 Akhanda Naam Kirtan centres across India, establishing temples and ashrams, and several other activities of the kind went on continuously.&lt;ref name="Gurus"/&gt;

Millions of men and women took spiritual initiation from Sitaram. His reputation spread and people gathered in large numbers wherever he resided. Sitaram was respected by contemporaries such as [[Anandamayi Ma]], [[Mohanananda Brahmachari]], [[Dalai Lama]], [[Vilayat Inayat Khan]], [[Swami Chidananda]], [[Sushil Kumar (Jain monk)|Jain Muni Sushil Kumar]] and others.&lt;ref name="Gurus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Mother Divine"/&gt;

==Teachings==

According to Omkarnath,
{{Quote| ''Nama'' meant ''Nama'' of God; [[Rama]], Krishna, Shiva, Durga; but ''Nama'' had to be repeated constantly. ''Nama'' could reach the [[Sadhaka]] to ''[[Nāda yoga|Nada]]'' and ''Jyoti'' (Divine Sounds and Lights); ...and ultimately Name could bring ''[[Om|Onkar]]'', the Anahat sound one could hear inside. So what the [[Rishis]] of the old days could not gain even after hundred of years of [[Tapasya]] in jungles, Nama could achieve even when a person lived his normal life and did his every day work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Banerjee |first=R. K. |date=January 1993 |title=Shree Shree Sitaramdas Omkarnath |url=http://www.anandamayi.org/anandavarta/Vol40No1.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Ananda Varta |volume=40 |issue=1 |page=1 |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Sitaramdas Omkarnath's spiritual philosophy encompassed [[Bhakti]], [[Jnana]], [[Karma Yoga]], [[Kriya Yoga]] and all segments of ancient Indian religion, with emphasis on Nam [Lord's Name]. Sitaramdas did not promote conversion, but guided all seekers on the path of their respective religion. He said- 'The paths may differ, but HE is not different.' By holding onto the Holy Name of Lord, and by performing the duties prescribed by religion of oneself, everybody can attain the Supreme Truth. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite Journal |first=Vithal|last=Ramanuja|title='Bishesh Sraddharghya' |newspaper=[[Bartaman]] Patrika (Bengali: বর্তমান) |date= August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teachings of Omkarnath derive from his personal experiences, revealed in the course of a lifelong and continual spiritual practice. His teachings were compiled by Kinkar Omananda (alias Madhav Swamiji), his closest monastic disciple.&lt;ref name="Cloudburst"/&gt;{{rp|at=c.Introduction¶.17}}

==Miracles==
Many of unexplained incidents associated with Omkarnath have been documented in books and newspapers by prominent personalities. Among these are:

*The writer [[Nabaneeta Dev Sen]] wrote of a 'medical miracle' she had seen. Her father, Naren Dev, was in coma for several days but when Omkarnath came and touched him, he opened his eyes and talked and within a week had begun walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Devsen |first1=Nabanita |title=Bhraman Samagra |publisher=Dey's Publishing | isbn=978-81-295-0902-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Many newspapers of Kolkata reported a revival from death at a[[Calcutta Medical College]]. Padmalochan Mukerjee was declared dead, Omkarnath arrived, touched him and revived him in front of Sister G. Wood, who was overwhelmed by the incident.&lt;ref name="Gurus"/&gt;{{rp|126}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dr.Naliniranjan |last=Sengupta |title=Chithipotro|pages=4 |publisher= Jugantor(Bengali: যুগান্তর)  |date= 1 July 1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*General Sujan Singh Uban described that Omkarnath had foreseen the Indo-Pakistan war of December 1971 and that during the war a supernatural power of Omkarnath had given him an extraordinary victory. Besides the national issues, Uban had felt the powers of Omkarnath in many aspects of his personal life.&lt;ref name="Gurus"/&gt;{{rp|131}}

==Death==
Omkarnath died in the early hours of 6 December 1982. His body was placed at Sri Ramashram, Dumurdaha, so that people could pay their respects. He was cremated on a [[sandalwood]] pyre on 8 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Full text of "s.v.u.oriental journal"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11818">The '''Sleeping Beauty problem''' is a puzzle in [[decision theory]] in which an ideally rational [[Epistemology|epistemic]] agent is to be woken once or twice according to the [[toss of a coin]], once if heads and twice if tails, and asked her [[degree of belief]] for the coin having come up heads. 

== History ==
The problem was originally formulated in unpublished work in the mid 1980s by Arnold Zuboff (work that was later published as "One Self: The Logic of Experience"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.informaworld.com/index/902035430.pdf |title=One Self: The Logic of Experience |author=Arnold Zuboff |volume=33 |issue=1 |year=1990 |journal=Inquiry: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Philosophy |doi=10.1080/00201749008602210 |pages=39–68 |accessdate=November 7, 2014}}{{paywall|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) followed by a paper by Adam Elga.&lt;ref name="Elga"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elga |first=A. |year=2000 |title=Self-locating Belief and the Sleeping Beauty Problem |journal=Analysis |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=143–147 |doi=10.1093/analys/60.2.143 |jstor=3329167}}&lt;/ref&gt; A formal analysis of the problem of belief formation in decision problems with imperfect recall was provided first by Michele Piccione and [[Ariel Rubinstein]] in their paper: "On the Interpretation of Decision Problems with Imperfect Recall" where the "paradox of the absent minded driver" was first introduced and the Sleeping Beauty problem discussed as Example 5.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Piccione and Ariel Rubinstein (1997) “On the Interpretation of Decision Problems with Imperfect Recall,” ''Games and Economic Behavior'' 20, 3-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michele Piccione and Ariel Rubinstein (1997) “The Absent Minded Driver's Paradox: Synthesis and Responses,” ''Games and Economic Behavior'' 20, 121-130.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name "Sleeping Beauty" was given to the problem by [[Robert Stalnaker]] and was first used in extensive discussion in the [[Usenet newsgroup]] ''rec.puzzles'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maproom.co.uk/sb.html |title=Some "Sleeping Beauty" postings |author=Nick Wedd |date=June 14, 2006 |accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The problem==
[[Sleeping Beauty]] volunteers to undergo the following experiment and is told all of the following details: On Sunday she will be put to sleep. Once or twice, during the experiment, Beauty will be awakened, interviewed, and put back to sleep with an amnesia-inducing drug that makes her forget that awakening. A [[fair coin]] will be [[Coin flipping|tossed]] to determine which experimental procedure to undertake: 
* If the coin comes up heads, Beauty will be awakened and interviewed on Monday only. 
* If the coin comes up tails, she will be awakened and interviewed on Monday and Tuesday. 
In either case, she will be awakened on Wednesday without interview and the experiment ends.

Any time Sleeping Beauty is awakened and interviewed she will not be able to tell which day it is or whether she has been awakened before. During the interview Beauty is asked: "What is your [[credence (statistics)|credence]] now for the proposition that the coin landed heads?"

==Solutions==
This problem continues to produce ongoing debate.

===Thirder position===
The thirder position argues that the probability of heads is 1/3. Adam Elga argued for this position originally&lt;ref name="Elga" /&gt; as follows: Suppose Sleeping Beauty is told and she comes to fully believe that the coin landed tails. By even a highly restricted [[principle of indifference]], her credence that it is Monday should equal her credence that it is Tuesday since being in one situation would be subjectively indistinguishable from the other. In other words, [[Conditional probability|P(Monday {{pipe}} Tails)]] = P(Tuesday | Tails), and thus

:P(Tails and Tuesday) = P(Tails and Monday).

Consider now that Sleeping Beauty is told upon awakening and comes to fully believe that it is Monday. Guided by the objective chance of heads landing being equal to the chance of tails landing, it should therefore hold that P(Tails | Monday) = P(Heads | Monday), and thus

:P(Tails and Tuesday) = P(Tails and Monday) = P(Heads and Monday).

Since these three outcomes are exhaustive and exclusive for one trial, the probability of each is one-third by the previous two steps in the argument.

===Halfer position===
[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] responded to Elga's paper with the position that Sleeping Beauty's credence that the coin landed heads should be 1/2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=D. |year=2001 |title=Sleeping Beauty: reply to Elga |journal=Analysis |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=171–76 |doi=10.1093/analys/61.3.171 |jstor=3329230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleeping Beauty receives no new non-self-locating information throughout the experiment because she is told the details of the experiment. Since her credence before the experiment is P(Heads) = 1/2, she ought to continue to have a credence of P(Heads) = 1/2 since she gains no new relevant evidence when she wakes up during the experiment. This directly contradicts one of the thirder's premises, since it means P(Tails | Monday) = 1/3 and P(Heads | Monday) = 2/3.

[[Nick Bostrom]] argues that Sleeping Beauty does have new evidence about her future from Sunday: "that she ''is'' now in it," but does not know whether it is Monday or Tuesday, so the halfer argument fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nick |last=Bostrom |title=Sleeping beauty and self-location: A hybrid model |journal=Synthese |date=July 2007 |volume=157 |issue=1 |pages=59–78 |url=http://www.anthropic-principle.com/preprints/beauty/synthesis.pdf |doi=10.1007/s11229-006-9010-7 |jstor=27653543}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, she gains the information that it is not both Tuesday and the case that Heads was flipped.

===Double halfer position===
The double halfer position&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meacham, C. J. |year=2008 |title=Sleeping beauty and the dynamics of de se beliefs |journal=Philosophical Studies |volume=138 |issue=2 |pages=245–269 |doi=10.1007/s11098-006-9036-1 |jstor=40208872}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that both P(Heads) and P(Heads | Monday) equal 1/2. Mikaël Cozic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mikaël Cozic |title=Imaging and Sleeping Beauty: A case for double-halfers |journal=International Journal of Approximate Reasoning |volume=52 |issue=2 |date=February 2011 |pages=137–143 |doi=10.1016/j.ijar.2009.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular, argues that context-sensitive propositions like "it is Monday" are in general problematic for conditionalization and proposes the use of an imaging rule instead, which supports the double halfer position.

==Connections to other problems==

Nick Bostrom argues that the thirder position is implied by the [[Self-Indication Assumption]].

Credence about what precedes awakenings is a core question in connection with the [[anthropic principle]].

==Variations==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
===Extreme Sleeping Beauty===
This differs from the original in that there are one million and one wakings if tails comes up. It was formulated by [[Nick Bostrom]].

=== The Sailor's Child problem ===
A non-fantastical variation called the Sailor's Child problem was introduced by Radford M. Neal. It involves a sailor who regularly sails between ports. On one port there is a woman who wants to have a child with him, across the sea there is another woman who also wants to have a child with him.  The sailor cannot decide if he will have one or two children so he will leave it up to coin toss. If Heads he will have one child and if Tails two children. But if the coin lands on Head which woman would have his child? He would decide this by looking at The Sailors Guide to Ports and the woman in the port that appears first would be the woman that he has a child with. You are his child. You do not have a copy of The Sailors Guide to Ports. What is the probability that you are his only child, thus the coin landed on Heads (assume a fair coin). &lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0608592.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-fictional situations ===
The problem does not necessarily need to involve a fictional situation. For example, computers can be programmed to act as Sleeping Beauty and not know when they are being run; consider a program that is run twice after tails is flipped and once after heads is flipped.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21614">In [[linguistics]], '''sound symbolism''', '''phonesthesia''' or '''phonosemantics''' is the idea that vocal sounds or [[phoneme]]s carry meaning in and of themselves.

==Origin==
In the 18th century, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] propagated a theory that words containing certain sounds should bear certain meanings; for instance, the front vowel sounds E, I, YU should be used when depicting tender subjects and those with back vowel sounds O, U, Y when describing things that may cause fear ("like anger, envy, pain, and sorrow").&lt;ref&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/lomonos/texts/lo0/lo7/lo7-0892.htm М. В. Ломоносов. Краткое руководство к красноречию. Книга первая, в которой содержится риторика, показующая общие правила обоего красноречия, то есть оратории и поэзии, сочиненная в пользу любящих словесные науки (1748)] // Ломоносов М. В. Полное собрание сочинений / АН СССР. — М.; Л., 1950—1983.
Т. 7: Труды по филологии 1739—1758 гг. — М.; Л.: Изд-во АН СССР, 1952. — С. 242 (§ 172).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) who is considered to be the founder of modern 'scientific' linguistics. Central to what de Saussure says about words are two related statements: First, he says that "the [[Sign (linguistics)|sign]] is arbitrary". He considers the words that we use to indicate things and concepts could be any words &amp;mdash; they are essentially just a consensus agreed upon by the speakers of a language and have no discernible pattern or relationship to the thing. Second, he says that, because words are arbitrary, they have meaning only in relation to other words. A dog is a dog because it is not a cat or a mouse or a horse, etc. These ideas have permeated the study of words since the 19th century.

==Types==

[[Margaret Magnus]] is the author of a comprehensive book designed to explain phonosemantics to the lay reader: ''Gods in the Word''. This work describes three types of sound symbolism using a model first proposed by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (see below):

===Onomatopoeia===
{{see also|Onomatopoeia}}
This is the least significant type of symbolism. It is simply imitative of sounds or suggests something that makes a sound. Some examples are "crash", "bang", and "whoosh".

===Clustering===

Words that share a sound sometimes have something in common. If we take, for example, words that have no prefix or suffix and group them according to meaning, some of them will fall into a number of categories. So we find that there is a group of words beginning with /b/ that are about barriers, bulges and bursting, and some other group of /b/ words that are about being banged, beaten, battered, bruised, blistered and bashed. This proportion is, according to Magnus, above the average for other letters.

Another hypothesis states that if a word begins with a particular phoneme, then there is likely to be a number of other words starting with that phoneme that refer to the same thing. An example given by Magnus is if the basic word for 'house' in a given language starts with a /h/, then by clustering, disproportionately many words containing /h/ can be expected to concern housing: hut, home, hovel, habitat...

Sound symbolic words cannot be broken down into smaller units of meaning. Sound clusters are not treated as [[morpheme]]s. Words beginning with /gl/ (glitter, gleam, glow, glisten, etc.) pertain to light reflection but [gl] on its own has no meaning nor does every other word with /gl/ refer to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907495600|title=Introducing morphology|last=Lieber|first=Rochelle|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2016|isbn=9781107480155|edition= Second |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=48|oclc=907495600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clustering is language dependent, although closely related languages will have similar clustering relationships.

===Iconism===
Iconism, according to Magnus, becomes apparent when comparing words which have the same sort of referent. One way is to look at a group of words that all refer to the same thing and that differ only in their sound, such as 'stamp', 'stomp', 'tamp', 'tromp', 'tramp', and 'step'. An /m/ before the /p/ in some words makes the action more forceful; compare 'stamp' with 'step' or 'tamp' with 'tap'. According to Magnus, the /r/ sets the word in motion, especially after a /t/ so a 'tamp' is in one place, but a 'tramp' goes for a walk. The /p/ in all those words would be what emphasizes the individual steps.

Magnus suggests that this kind of iconism is universal across languages.

===Phenomimes and psychomimes===

Some languages possess a category of words midway between onomatopoeia and usual words. Whereas [[onomatopoeia]] refers to the use of words to imitate actual sounds, there are languages known for having a special class of words that "imitate" soundless states or events, called ''phenomimes'' (when they describe external phenomena) and ''psychomimes'' (when they describe psychological states). On a scale that orders all words according to the correlation between their meaning and their sound, with the sound-imitating words like ''meow'' and ''whack'' at one end, and with the conventional words like ''water'' and ''blue'' at the other end, the phenomimes and the psychomimes would be somewhere in the middle. In the case of the Japanese language, for example, such words are learned in early childhood and are considerably more effective than usual words in conveying feelings and states of mind or in describing states, motions, and transformations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.aall.ufl.edu/SJS/Baba.pdf Junko Baba, "Pragmatic Function of Japanese Mimesis in Emotive Discourse"] The author shows that psychomimes "create more vivid and intensified expressions to fuel the liveliness of the personal conversation" and "are effectively used to dramatize the emotive state of the protagonist".&lt;/ref&gt; They are not found, however, only in children's vocabulary, but widely used in daily conversation among adults and even in more formal writing. Like Japanese, the Korean language also has a relatively high proportion of phenomimes and psychomimes.

==History of phonosemantics==

Several ancient traditions exist which talk about an archetypal relationship between sounds and ideas. Some of these are discussed below, but there are others as well. If we include a link between ''letters'' and ideas then the list includes the [[Viking]] ''[[Runes]]'', the [[Hebrew]] ''[[Kabbalah]]'', the [[Arab]] ''[[Abjad]]'', etc.. References of this kind are very common in [[The Upanishads]], The [[Nag Hammadi Library]], the [[Celt]]ic ''[[Book of Taliesin]]'', as well as [[early Christian]] works, the [[Shinto]] [[Kototama]], and [[Shingon]] [[Buddhism]].

===Old Chinese===

Sinologist Axel Schuessler asserts that in [[Old Chinese]], "Occasionally, certain meanings are associated with certain sounds."&lt;ref name="Schuessler"&gt;Schuessler (2007), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning initials, he suggests that words with meanings such as "dark, black, covered" etc. tend begin with &lt;tt&gt;*m-&lt;/tt&gt;, while those indicating "soft, subtle, flexible" begin with &lt;tt&gt;*n-&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref name="Schuessler"/&gt; Taking a broader perspective, he also notes that "Roots and stems meaning 'round, turn, return' have an initial &lt;tt&gt;*w-&lt;/tt&gt; not only in Chinese, but generally in the languages of the area."&lt;ref name="Schuessler"/&gt;

As for finals in Old Chinese, Schuessler points out, "Words that signify movement with an abrupt endpoint often end in &lt;tt&gt;*-k&lt;/tt&gt;," and "Words with the meaning 'shutting, closing' [...] tend to end in final &lt;tt&gt;*-p&lt;/tt&gt;."&lt;ref name="Schuessler"/&gt; He also notes an overlap between the significations of initial &lt;tt&gt;*m-&lt;/tt&gt; and final &lt;tt&gt;*-m&lt;/tt&gt;: "Words that imply 'keeping in a closed mouth' tend to end in a final &lt;tt&gt;*-m&lt;/tt&gt;".&lt;ref name="Schuessler"/&gt;

===Plato and the Cratylus Dialogue===

In ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', [[Plato]] has [[Socrates]] commenting on the origins and correctness of various names and words. When [[Hermogenes (philosopher)|Hermogenes]] asks if he can provide another hypothesis on how signs come into being (his own is simply 'convention'), Socrates initially suggests that they fit their referents in virtue of the sounds they are made of:

{{quote|Now the letter [[rho]], as I was saying, appeared to the imposer of names an excellent instrument for the expression of motion; and he frequently uses the letter for this purpose: for example, in the actual words rein and roe he represents motion by rho; also in the words tromos (trembling), trachus (rugged); and again, in words such as krouein (strike), thrauein (crush), ereikein (bruise), thruptein (break), kermatixein (crumble), rumbein (whirl): of all these sorts of movements he generally finds an expression in the letter R, because, as I imagine, he had observed that the tongue was most agitated and least at rest in the pronunciation of this letter, which he therefore used in order to express motion|Cratylus.&lt;ref&gt;(note this is an open source translation available at [http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/cratylus.html Internet Classics Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, faced by an overwhelming number of counterexamples given by Hermogenes, Socrates has to admit that "my first notions of original names are truly wild and ridiculous".

===Upanishads===

The [[Upanishads]] contain a lot of material about sound symbolism, for instance:

{{quote|The mute consonants represent the earth, the sibilants the sky, the vowels heaven. The mute consonants represent fire, the sibilants air, the vowels the sun… The mute consonants represent the eye, the sibilants the ear, the vowels the mind.|[[Aitareya Aranyaka]] III.2.6.2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe01/sbe01237.htm] [[The Upanishads]], translated by [[Max Müller]], 1879.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Shingon Buddhism===

[[Kūkai]], the founder of [[Shingon]], wrote his ''Sound, word, reality'' in the 9th century which relates all sounds to the voice of the [[trikaya|Dharmakaya]] [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].

===Early Western phonosemantics===

The idea of phonosemantics was sporadically discussed during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. In 1690, [[John Locke|Locke]] wrote against the idea in an essay called "[[An Essay on Human Understanding]]". His argument was that if there were any connection between sounds and ideas, then we would all be speaking the same language, but this is an over-generalisation. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s book ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding]]'' published in 1765 contains a point by point critique of Locke's essay. Leibniz picks up on the generalization used by Locke and adopts a less rigid approach: clearly there is no perfect correspondence between words and things, but neither is the relationship completely arbitrary, although he seems vague about what that relationship might be.&lt;ref&gt;adapted from a literature review by Magnus - see website below&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern phonosemantics===
In 1836 [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] published ''Über die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einfluß auf die geistige Entwicklung des Menschengeschlechts.'' It is here that he establishes the three kinds of relationship between sounds and ideas as discussed above under '''Types of Sound Symbolism'''. Below is a sample of researchers in the field of phonosemantics.

[[Otto Jespersen]] suggests that: "Sound symbolism, we may say, makes some words more fit to survive."  [[Dwight Bolinger]] of [[Harvard University]] was the primary proponent of phonosemantics through the late 1940s and the 1950s. In 1949, he published ''The Sign is Not Arbitrary''. He concluded that [[morpheme]]s cannot be defined as the minimal meaning-bearing units, in part because [[Meaning (linguistic)|linguistic meaning]] is so ill-defined, and in part because there are obvious situations in which smaller units are meaning-bearing.

[[Ivan Fónagy]] (1963) correlates phonemes with [[metaphors]]. For example, nasal and velarized vowels are quite generally considered ‘dark’, front vowels as ‘fine’ and ‘high’. Unvoiced stops have been considered ‘thin’ by European linguists, whereas the fricatives were labelled ‘raw’ and ‘hairy’ by the Greeks.

[[Hans Marchand]] provided the first extensive list of English [[phonestheme]]s. He wrote, for example, that "/l/ at the end of a word symbolizes prolongation, continuation" or "nasals at the end of a word express continuous vibrating sounds."

[[Gérard Genette]] published the only full length history of phonosemantics, ''Mimologics'' (1976). In 450 pages, Genette details the evolution of the linguistic iconism among linguists and poets, in syntax, morphology and phonology.&lt;ref&gt;The above review of modern phonosemantics is partially adapted from a literature review by Magnus - see website below.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguist [[Keith McCune]] demonstrated in his doctoral thesis that virtually every word in the [[Indonesian language]] has an iconic (phonosemantic) component. His two-volume doctoral thesis "The Internal Structure of Indonesian Roots" was completed at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1983 and published  in [[Jakarta]] in 1985.

==Relationship with neuroscience==

[[Image:Booba-Kiki.svg|thumb|right|250px|Booba and Kiki shapes|This image is an illustration of the [[Bouba/kiki effect]]. Canary Islands natives called the shape on the left "kiki" and the one on the right "bouba".]]

In the 2003 [[BBC]] [[Reith Lectures]], [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] outlined his research into the links between [[brain structure]] and function. In the fourth lecture of the series he describes the phenomena of [[synesthesia]] in which people experience, for example, sounds in terms of colors, or sounds in terms of tastes. In one type of synesthesia, people see numbers, letters of the alphabet, or even musical notes as having a distinct color. Ramachandran proposes a model for how language might have evolved.{{Clarify|date=May 2009}} The theory may explain how humans create [[metaphor]]s and how sounds can be metaphors for &lt;!--visual/mental--&gt; images – why for example sounds can be described as "bright" or "dull". In explaining how language might have evolved from cross activation of adjacent areas in the brain, Ramachandran notes four crucial factors, not all related to language, but which combined might have resulted in [[Origin of language|the emergence of language]]. Two of these four processes are of particular interest here.

''[[Synesthetic cross modal abstraction]]'': i.e. we recognize properties that sounds and images have in common and abstract them to store them independently. The sounds and shapes of the objects have characteristics in common that can be abstracted; for example, a "sharp", "cutting" quality of a word, and the shape it describes. Ramachandran calls this the '[[Bouba/kiki effect]]', based on the results of an experiment with two abstract shapes, one blob-like and the other spiky, that asked people to relate the nonsense words ''bouba'' and ''kiki'' to them. The effect is real and observable, repeatable across linguistic groups, and evident even in the description of the experiment (with the ''bouba'' shape usually described using similar-sounding words like ''bulbous'' or ''blobby'' while the ''kiki'' shape is ''prickly'' or ''spiky'').

''Built in preexisting cross activation''. Ramachandran points out that areas of the brain which appear to be involved in the mix-ups in synesthesia are adjacent to each other physically, and that cross-wiring, or cross activation, could explain synesthesia and our ability to make metaphors. He notes that the areas that control the muscles around the mouth are also adjacent to the visual centers, and suggests that certain words appear to make our mouth imitate the thing we are describing. Examples of this might be words like "teeny weeny", "diminutive" to describe small things; "large" or "enormous" to describe big things.

More recently, research on [[ideasthesia]] indicated that Kiki and Bouba have an entire semantic-like network of associated cross-modal experiences.

==Relationship with poetry==

The sound of words is important in the field of [[poetry]], and [[rhetoric]] more generally.  Tools such as [[euphony]], [[alliteration]], and [[rhyme]] all depend on the speaker or writer confidently choosing the best-sounding word.

[[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]]'s book ''Euphonics: A Poet's Dictionary of Enchantments'' collects lists of words of similar meaning and similar sounds. For example, the entry for "gl-" contains words for shiny things: glisten, gleam, glint, glare, glam, glimmer, glaze, glass, glitz, gloss, [[glory (optical phenomenon)|glory]], glow, and glitter.  Likewise, in German, nouns starting with "kno-" and "knö-" are mostly small and round: ''Knoblauch'' "garlic", ''Knöchel'' "ankle", ''Knödel'' "dumpling", ''Knolle'' "tuber", ''Knopf'' "button", ''Knorren'' "knot (in a tree)", ''Knospe'' "bud (of a plant)", ''Knoten'' "knot (in string or rope)".

==Use in commerce==
Phonesthesia is used in commerce for the names of products and even companies themselves. According to linguist [[Steven Pinker]], one particularly "egregious example" was when cigarette maker [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] rebranded to [[Altria]]. The name "Altria" is claimed to come from the Latin word for "high"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-2337818_ITM | work=Finance Wire | title=Altria Director Discusses Rebranding Company, CNNfn | date=November 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Pinker sees the change as an attempt to "switch its image from bad people who sell addictive [[carcinogen]]s to a place or state marked by [[altruism]] and other lofty values".&lt;ref name="Pinker"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Stuff of Thought | publisher=Penguin Books | year=2007 | accessdate=21 August 2013 | author=Pinker, Steven | pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand names of many pharmaceuticals are common examples.

'''Ugo Mattei''' (born 1961 in [[Turin]], [[Piedmont]]) is the Alfred and Hanna Fromm Professor of International and Comparative Law at the [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]], in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] and a full Professor of Civil Law in the [[University of Turin]], [[Italy]]. He is the Academic Coordinator of the [[International University College of Turin]], Italy, a radically new school where issues of law and finance in global capitalism are critically approached. He is also a columnist for the Italian newspapers ''[[Il Manifesto]]'' and [[Il Fatto Quotidiano]]. For his ground-breaking studies on the commons, in 2017 Mattei won the [[Elinor Ostrom]] Award for the Collective Governance of the Commons.

Mattei graduated first in his class in 1983 from the Law School of the [[University of Turin]] and he received his LL.M. from [[Boalt Hall]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]] School of Law) in 1989 where he was a [[Fulbright Fellow]]. He also attended the [[London School of Economics]] and the [[Faculté Internationale de Droit Comparé]] in [[Strasbourg]].

Mattei has been a visiting scholar at [[Yale Law School]] and the [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] and [[Wolfson College, Cambridge|Wolfson College]], [[University of Cambridge]], and a visiting professor at Oslo, [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], Montpellier, Macau. In 1985 he joined the law school of the [[University of Trento]], where he received tenure as a full professor in 1990. In 1992 he was appointed as a professor in the Faculté Internationale de Droit Comparé (Strasbourg), where he served for four years.

In 1993, Mattei taught as a visiting professor on the U.C. Hastings faculty, where in 1994 he was appointed as the first holder of the Fromm Chair in International and Comparative Law, succeeding [[Rudolf Schlesinger]] in teaching [[Comparative Law|comparative law]]. In 1997, he accepted a call from the [[University of Turin, Faculty of Law]] to succeed the famous Italian scholar [[Rodolfo Sacco]] in the Chair of Civil Law. He is a Full Member of the International Academy of Comparative Law, a member of the Executive Committee of the American Society of Comparative Law, a member of the Advisory Board of the Friburg Institute of Comparative Law, an advisor to the Institute of Law, Economics and Finances at [[Copenhagen Business School]], a General Editor of the Series Common Core of European Private Law (Trento Project) at [[Cambridge University Press]], a series editor of European Private Law in Context at [[Springer Science+Business Media|Kluwer International]] and an [[editor in chief]] of ''[[Berkeley Electronic Press#List of B.E. Press journals .28by field.29|Global Jurist]]''. He is a member of the Editorial Board of the ''[[International Review of Law and Economics]]'' and of ''New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics and Law''.

Mattei’s scholarship is broadly multi-disciplinary. Mattei has published many books and more than one hundred other publications in [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. His book in English, written with anthropologist [[Laura Nader]], ''Plunder: When the Rule of Law is Illegal''.&lt;ref name="Plunder"&gt;Ugo Mattei and Laura Nader, ''Plunder: When the Rule of Law is Illegal'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-7895-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been translated in five languages.

Ugo Mattei has recently oriented the focus of his research on the study and practice of the commons after successfully masterminding a nationwide referendum against privatization of water in 2011. His Italian bestseller "Beni Comuni.Un Manifesto"&lt;ref&gt;Ugo Mattei, Beni Comuni.Un Manifesto, Bari Roma, Laterza 2013&lt;/ref&gt; has generated much attention throughout European social movements. Mattei experimented some of the ideas developed in that book in Naples as the President of the local water company from 2012 to 2014 and in Chieri (Turin) as a Deputy Major in 2014 and 2015.  He is currently leading a project on commons with Saki Bailey ([[International University College of Turin]]) and [[Filippo Valguarnera]] ([[Örebro University]]) in the context of the Common Core of European Private Law. In 2015 together with ecologist and scientist [[Fritjof Capra]] he has published "The Ecology of Law. Toward a Legal System in Tune with Nature and Community".&lt;ref&gt;Fritjof Capra &amp; Ugo Mattei, The Ecology of Law. Toward a Legal System in Tune with Nature and Community, Oakland, Berrett-Koheler, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4944">A '''Ulysses pact''' or '''Ulysses contract''' is a freely made [[decision making|decision]] that is designed and intended to bind oneself in the future. The term is used in [[medicine]], especially in reference to [[advance directive]]s (also known as [[living will]]s), where there is some controversy over whether a decision made by a person in one state of health should be considered binding upon that person when he or she is in a markedly different, usually worse, state of health.

==Origin of the name==
The term refers to the pact that Ulysses ([[Ancient Greece|Greek]] name Ὀδυσσεύς, ''[[Odysseus]]'') made with his men as they approached the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s. Ulysses wanted to hear the Sirens' song although he knew that doing so would render him incapable of rational thought. He put wax in his men's ears so that they could not hear, and had them tie him to the mast so that he could not jump into the sea. He ordered them not to change course under any circumstances, and to keep their swords upon him and to attack him if he should break free of his bonds.

Upon hearing the Sirens' song, Ulysses was driven temporarily insane and struggled with all of his might to break free so that he might join the Sirens, which would have meant his death.

==Psychiatric context==
[[Psychiatric advance directive]]s are sometimes referred to as ''Ulysses pacts'' or ''Ulysses contracts'', where there is a legal agreement designed to override a present request from a [[competence (law)|legally competent]] patient in favor of a past request made by that patient.&lt;ref name=spellecy&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ryan Spellecy |title=Reviving Ulysses contracts |journal=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal |year=2003 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=373–392 |doi=10.1353/ken.2004.0010 |pmid=15049305}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of when Ulysses contracts are invoked is when people with [[schizophrenia]] stop taking their medication at perceived [[remission (medicine)|remission]] times.&lt;ref name=puran&gt;{{cite journal |author=Namita Puran |title=Ulysses Contracts: Bound to Treatment or Free to Choose? |journal=The York Scholar |year=2005 |volume=2 |pages=42–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological context==
In the wake of the [[Snowden revelations]], digital technology companies and commentators have had to consider the situation of a technology provider being ordered by a government to act in a way that they feel morally opposed to.  One example is that Apple, as part of the [[FBI–Apple encryption dispute]], decided to engineer the iPhone in a way that made it impossible for them to read the data on it, which has been described as "a digital Ulysses pact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vogt|first1=PJ|title=Apple Will No Longer Let The Cops Into Your Phone|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/apple-wont-let-police-your-phone/|publisher=WNYC|accessdate=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A related example is that of a [[warrant canary]], which [[Cory Doctorow]] describes as being a Ulysses pact (albeit a "weak" one, since the issuer of the canary can fail or be forced not to kill the canary), as is [[binary transparency]] (applying the idea of [[certificate transparency]] to binary executable files), which he describes as a "much stronger, more effective Ulysses pact", since a public append-only log is harder to censor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doctorow|first1=Cory|title='Warrant canaries': a subtle hint that your email provider is compromised|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/20/warrant-canaries-a-subtle-hint-that-your-email-provider-is-compromised|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy context==
Ulysses clauses in public policy are provisions that discourage or prevent future changes. For example, in the state of California initiatives generally include a Ulysses clause to prevent amendments.

==Biography==

Vallicella has a Ph.D. ([[Boston College]]; 1978), taught for a number of years at [[University of Dayton]] (where he was a tenured Associate Professor of Philosophy; 1978–91) and [[Case Western Reserve University]] (Visiting Associate Professor of Philosophy; 1989–91), and retired to [[Gold Canyon, Arizona]] from where he now contributes to philosophy mainly online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=61485 |title=Notes on Contributors |journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]] |volume=75 |issue=4 |page=475 |doi=10.1017/s0031819100000620}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://maverickphilosopher.powerblogs.com sketchy bio-details here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maverickphilosopher.blogspot.com/2004/10/on-being-independent-philosopher.html |title=Maverick Philosopher: On Being an Independent Philosopher |publisher=Maverickphilosopher.blogspot.com |date=October 26, 2004 |accessdate=March 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mullins2006"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mullins |first=Matthew |url=http://prosblogion.ektopos.com/archives/2006/03/new-contributor-4.html |title=New Contributor – The Prosblogion |publisher=Prosblogion.ektopos.com |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the author of many published articles, primarily on the subjects of [[metaphysics]] and [[philosophy of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=61485 ''Philosophy'' (2000), 75 : 475–75, [[Cambridge University Press]], December 11, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:GW3FXPVLLvMJ:philosophy.hku.hk/paper/%3Fq%3Dstory+Vallicella+%22University+of+dayton%22&amp;cd=33&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a&lt;/ref&gt;

In the short chapter on him in the book ''Falling in love with wisdom: American philosophers talk about their calling'', Vallicella discusses the philosophical questions which he happened to think about in his youth, such as "What if God hadn't created anything?", "What if even God didn't exist", and "Why is good, good, and evil, evil?", and his thoughts on the inquiry of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=1MuuWezK7w8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Vallicella&amp;ots=x6R8V2-bTS&amp;sig=OCP0Y8pTcL8dStQkBzTxe9tCb18#v=onepage&amp;q=Vallicella&amp;f=false ''Falling in love with wisdom: American philosophers talk about their calling'', David D.

''[[Forbes]]'' summarizes this book as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbesbookclub.com/BookPage.asp?prod_cd=IANFA Forbes book summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"What is it for any contingent thing to exist? Why does any contingent thing exist? For some time now, the preferred style in addressing such questions has been deflationary when it has not been eliminativist. In its critical half, this book thoroughly analyzes and demolishes the main deflationary and eliminativist accounts of [[existence]], including those of [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]], [[Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], thereby restoring existence to its rightful place as one of the deep topics in philosophy, if not the deepest. In its constructive half, the book defends the thesis that the two questions admit of a unified answer, and that this answer takes the form of what the author calls a paradigm theory of existence. The central idea of the [[paradigm]] theory is that existence itself is a paradigmatically existent concrete individual. In this way the author vindicates [[onto-theology]] and puts paid to the [[Heideggerian]] conceit that Being cannot itself be a being. This work will be of interest to all serious students and teachers of philosophy, especially those interested in [[metaphysics]] and the [[philosophy of religion]]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''William Henry Chamberlin Jr.''' (February 12, 1870&amp;nbsp;– May 9, 1921) was an American [[Mormon]] [[philosopher]], [[theologian]], and educator. His teachings and writings worked to reconcile [[Mormonism]] with the [[theory of evolution]].  He taught philosophy and ancient languages as well as science and math at several [[LDS Church|Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) institutions including [[Brigham Young University]] in the early 20th century. He was one of four educators at Brigham Young University whose teaching of evolution and attempts to reconcile it with Mormon thought, although strongly popular with students, generated controversy among university officials and the LDS community. Chamberlin has been called "Mormonism's first professionally trained philosopher and theologian."&lt;ref name=McLachlan96&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLachlan|first= James M.|title= W. H.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
William Chamberlin was born in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] on February 12, 1870 to parents William Henry Chamberlin and Eliza Frances Brown Chamberlin. William Jr. was the oldest of 12 children. He showed early interest in botany, geology, and mathematics. His brother [[Ralph Vary Chamberlin]] would go on to become a noted biologist and would later become embroiled with William in controversy regarding the teaching of evolution. On September 28, 1892, Chamberlin married Amelia Telle Cannon, a daughter of [[President (LDS Church honorific)|President]] [[George Q. Cannon]], First Counselor in the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)]]. William and Amelia had six children: Max Cannon, Hester, Martha, Paul, Frances, and Luke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Utah News|work=[[The Latter-Day Saints' Millennial Star]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5JJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA687|year=1892|publisher=Parley P.

===Mission and early career===
Chamberlin's early career was divided between teaching, studying, and working to support his family. He taught in public schools from 1889-1891, and from 1891 to 1897 he taught math, geology, and astronomy at [[Latter-day Saint College]]. He finally completed a Bachelor of Arts in science with the [[University of Utah]] in 1896. From 1897 to 1900 he served a [[Mission (LDS Church)|mission]] in the South Pacific [[Society Islands]] where as part of his [[proselytizing]] he translated the [[Book of Mormon]] into [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], and became [[mission president]], an ordained [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]] of the Church. Around the turn of the century he donated a large collection of ferns from Utah and the South Pacific to the University of Utah's natural history museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chamberlin|first= Ralph V.|year=1960|title=The University of Utah, a History of its First Hundred Years, 1850 to 1950|location=Salt Lake City|publisher= University of Utah Press|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1900 to 1904 he taught science and theology at [[Brigham Young College]], where he was Chair of Geology and Mineralogy.&lt;ref name=McLachlan96/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chamberlin papers bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arrington&amp;Bitton1992&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arrington|first1=Leonard J.|last2=Bitton|first2=Davis|title=The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-Day Saints|date=1992|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana|isbn=9780252062360|pages=258–261|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMQgrBcI998C&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barlow2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barlow|first1=Philip L.|title=Mormons and the Bible: The Place of the Latter-day Saints in American Religion|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780199739035|pages=112–161|edition=Updated |chapter=The Mormon Response to Higher Criticism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy and Brigham Young years===
{{main|1911 Brigham Young University controversy}}
{{Further|History of Brigham Young University}}
In 1901, Chamberlin began studying philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]]. Over several years he studied philosophy with several prominent thinkers, including [[George Howison]] at [[U.C. Berkeley]] and [[Josiah Royce]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. He earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from the University of Chicago in 1906.

In 1909, William Chamberlin was recruited to Brigham Young University (BYU) by president [[George H. Brimhall]], as part of an effort to increase the academic quality of his university. Two years earlier, Brimhall had recruited brothers [[Joseph Peterson (psychologist)|Joseph]] and Henry Peterson, professors of psychology and education, as well as Chamberlin's own brother Ralph, a biologist. William Chamberlin taught philosophy and ancient languages. The Chamberlin and Peterson brothers, while devout Mormons, actively sought to increase the intellectual atmosphere of the university and community, facilitating discussion and debates on evolution and the Bible, and sought to convey that evolutionary ideas and Mormon theology were not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary. The four instructors' courses were popular among students and other faculty, but university and church officials accused the professors of promoting heretical views, and in 1911 offered the Petersons and Ralph Chamberlin a choice: alter their teachings or lose their jobs. This ignited a great deal of controversy in the school and surrounding community. The students of BYU overwhelmingly supported the professors, and a petition of support signed by at least 80% of the student body was submitted to BYU officials and reprinted in the ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune|Salt Lake Tribune]]'', Salt Lake City's largest secular newspaper. William Chamberlin was not given the same ultimatum, but soon after the accusations he published an essay entitled "The Theory of Evolution as an Aid to Faith in God and Belief in the Resurrection" in the BYU student newspaper, whose student editors wrote "the thoughtful reading of it will well repay any student".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Second supplement|work=The White and Blue|
volume= 14|number=14|date=1911-02-14|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Petersons and Ralph Chamberlin left the university in 1911, while William remained for another 5 years, resigning in 1916.&lt;ref name=McLachlan96/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arrington&amp;Bitton1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherlock85&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherlock|first=Richard|title=Campus in Crisis: BYU's earliest conflict between secular knowledge and religious belief|date=January–February 1979|work=[[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]]|issue=13|pages=10–16|url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/013-10-16.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In 1917 Chamberlin began a PhD with Harvard philosopher [[Ralph Barton Perry]], but left after one year due to poor health and financial troubles. He taught philosophy at the University of Utah from 1917 to 1920, and later at [[Utah State Agricultural College]] until his death.

Chamberlin died in [[Logan, Utah]] following a flu infection on May 9, 1921. He was fifty-one years old.&lt;ref name=McLachlan96/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chamberlin papers bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Improvement Era"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/stream/improvementera2409unse#page/858/mode/1up|title=Passing Events|journal=[[Improvement Era]]|volume=24|number=9|date=July 1921|page=858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and theology==
{{See also|Mormon views on evolution}}
Chamberlin's philosophical views have been termed "spiritual realism", and are rooted in the philosophical tradition of [[personalism]].  Mormon scholar [[James McLachlan (editor and professor)|James M. McLaughlin]] consolidated Chamberlin's philosophical views into five major statements:&lt;ref name=McLachlan96/&gt;{{rp|159}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Persons are eternal, they are ontologically and metaphysically ultimate. This personalism is tied to a pragmatic theory of knowledge in which truth is determined in relation to its outcome and the interests and purposes of persons.
#Community and sociality is an essential feature of the being of persons. The moral meaning of the world grows out of the relation of eternal co-dependence of persons in community. At the head of this community is God.
#God is a person and is the ultimate example of personal existence. God is dependent on the other members of the community of minds.
#God's revelation in the world is limited to the capacity of human truth; it must be stated in human terms. 
#Evolution is a true and explanatory principle through which we can come to understand the development of the "Kingdom of God." Evolution must be viewed as a teleology reflecting God's design and not as a string of efficient causes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chamberlin was the first LDS scholar to extensively apply [[higher criticism]] to the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name=Russell86&gt;{{cite journal|first=William D. |last=Russell|title= Beyond Literalism|journal= Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought| volume=19| number= 1| date=Spring 1986|pages= 57–67|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V19N01_59.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63}} Religious scholar Anthony Hutchinson labeled Chamberlin's style of [[biblical criticism]] (the academic study of the Bible) as a "critical historical and philological hermeneutic" approach,{{efn|[[Philology]] is the study of language in historic texts, while [[Biblical hermeneutics|hermeneutics]] is the interpretation of religious texts.}} broadly characterized by acceptance of mainstream (non-LDS) biblical criticism and fluency in ancient biblical languages. According to Hutchinson, relative strengths of this approach, as compared to other LDS approaches to biblical studies, include ease of communicating with scholars of [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], while relative weaknesses include a highly intellectual approach which may preclude its application to popular religious practice, and promotion of views that may be interpreted as [[Heresy in Christianity|heretical]]. Other LDS scholars Hutchinson grouped into this approach include [[Lowell L. Bennion]], [[Sterling McMurrin]], and [[John L. Sorenson]].&lt;ref name=Hutchinson82&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first= Anthony A.| title= LDS approaches to the Holy Bible|journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|volume=15|number=1|pages=99–124|date=Spring 1982|url=http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V15N01_101.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of thirty-eight prominent LDS intellectuals conducted by [[Leonard J. Arrington]] in the late 1960s, Chamberlin was recognized as one of the top twelve figures in LDS intellectual history.&lt;ref name=Arrington69&gt;{{cite journal|first=Leonard J.|last= Arrington|title=The intellectual tradition of the Latter-day Saints |journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|volume=4|issue=1|date=Spring 1969|pages=13–26|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/issues/V04N01.pdf#page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Philip L. Barlow]] notes that Chamberlin is less well-known than other prominent LDS figures.&lt;ref name=Barlow2013/&gt;{{rp|142}}

Students of Chamberlin's included [[E. E. Ericksen]],&lt;ref name=McLachlan96/&gt; who later become chairman of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Utah and who is known as a leading figure in LDS intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10 LDS 'Intellectuals'|last=Boyd|first=Hal|newspaper=Deseret News|date=June 10, 2011|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/top/168/1/E-E-Ericksen-Top-10-LDS-6Intellectuals7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His early research involved the study of political violence and [[empiricism]], especially the works of [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]]. He was Director of the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] from 1989 to 1997. In 2000, Michaud partnered with [[Jean-Jacques Aillagon]] to establish the ''Université de tous les savoirs (University of all knowledge)'', a French government initiative to disseminate information on new scientific advances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120721182019/http://www.alliance-us.org/en/Page.Culture.Lecture.Michaud.aspx  Yves Michaud], alliance-us.org.
