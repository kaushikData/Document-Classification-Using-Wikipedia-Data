'''Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language''' ('''ABSL''') is a [[village sign language]] used by about 150 [[deaf]] and many hearing members of the [[al-Sayyid, Israel|al-Sayyid]] [[Bedouin]] tribe in the [[Negev|Negev desert]] of southern [[Israel]].

As deafness is so frequent (4% of the population is deaf, compared to 0.1% in the United States)&lt;ref name=TalkingHands&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Talking Hands|year=2008|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deaf and hearing people share a language, deaf people are not stigmatised in this community, and marriage between deaf and hearing people is common. There is also no separate [[Deaf culture]] or politics.&lt;ref name="TalkingHands"/&gt;

==History==
In 2004, the Al-Sayyid community numbered around 3,000, most of whom trace their ancestry to the time the village was founded, in the mid-19th century, by a local woman and an [[Egypt]]ian man. Two of this founding couple's five sons carried a gene for nonsyndromic, genetically recessive, profound pre-lingual neurosensory deafness. The descendants of the founding couple often [[Cousin marriage|married their cousins]] due to the tribe's rejection by its neighbours for being "foreign [[fellah]]in".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=434665 One in Twenty] Haaretz, 2 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The gene became [[homozygous]] in several members of the family.

ABSL was first studied in the late 1990s by anthropologist Shifra Kisch&lt;ref&gt;Kisch, Shifra. 2000. ‘Deaf discourse’: Social construction of deafness in a Bedouin community in the Negev. MA thesis, Tel Aviv University.&lt;/ref&gt; and came to worldwide attention in February 2005 when an international group of researchers published a study of the language in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/102/7/2661.full The emergence of grammar: Systematic structure in a new language], Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Wendy Sandler, Irit Meir, Carol Padden, and Mark Aronoff&lt;/ref&gt; The spontaneous emergence of the language in the last 70 years, which has developed a complex grammar in near-isolation, is of particular interest to [[linguistics|linguists]] for the insights it provides into the birth of human language.

==Linguistics==
Scholars study ABSL because it is the closest they can come to performing the "forbidden experiment" (a type of [[language deprivation]] experiment in which children are isolated before they are exposed to any language so that experimenters may observe their organic formation of a language). Since deaf people in Al-Sayyid cannot hear Arabic or Hebrew and they have not been exposed to any other sign languages, ABSL is a brand new language, uninfluenced by any other.{{what|date=February 2015}} ABSL is in its early stages, so researchers are observing the language as it develops.&lt;ref name="TalkingHands"/&gt;

ABSL shows a preference for [[subject–object–verb]] [[word order]] (e.g., "woman child feed"), in marked contrast to the dialect of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] spoken by hearing members of the community ([[subject–verb–object|SVO]]), as well as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ([[subject–verb–object|SVO]]), classical Arabic ([[verb–subject–object|VSO]]), and the predominant sign languages in the region, [[Israeli Sign Language]] and [[Jordanian Sign Language]]. The authors of the study ([[Mark Aronoff]] from [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], [[Irit Meir]] and [[Wendy Sandler]] from the [[University of Haifa]] and [[Carol Padden]] from the [[University of California, San Diego]]) see ABSL as evidence for the human tendency to construct communication along [[grammar|grammatical]] lines. These authors remarked on the speed with which a grammar emerged, with the SOV word-order emerging with the first generation of signers, as well as the language's continuing rapid development – the third generation is signing twice as fast as the first and is using longer sentences.

Researchers have detected examples of abstraction in the language, a sure sign of grammatical development. For example, the sign for "man" is formed by the curling of the finger in the shape of a mustache, although Bedouin men no longer wear mustaches.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Wade|first=Nicholas |title=A New Language Arises, and Scientists Watch It Evolve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/01/science/01lang.html|accessdate=2012-11-11|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the language does not currently contain "agreeing" verbs, as most known sign languages do, which may indicate that the language has more grammatical development in store.&lt;ref name="TalkingHands"/&gt;

The community was isolated not by geography but by social stigma,&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; on several levels. Contact with the outside world is growing, as students are exposed to Israeli Sign Language and Jordanian Sign Language in schools, and community members are marrying outside the community.

The '''Alemannic Wikipedia''' (Alemannic: ''Alemannischi Wikipedia'') is the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic language]] edition of the [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based [[free-content]] [[encyclopedia]] [[Wikipedia]]. The project was started on November 13, 2003 as an [[Alsatian language]] edition. A year later it was expanded to encompass all Alemannic dialects because of low activity in the first year. Since 2004 all Alemannic dialects are accepted on als:wp.

As of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, this edition has about [[:als:Special:Statistics|{{formatnum:{{#expr:{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|als}} round -2}}}}]] articles&lt;ref&gt;[[:gsw:Spezial:Statischtik?uselang=en|Alemannic Wikipedia statistics page]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is the 108th largest Wikipedia by number of articles.&lt;ref&gt;[[m:Complete list of language Wikipedias ordered by size|Meta-Wiki's list of language Wikipedias ordered by size]]&lt;/ref&gt; Contributors and users include people from [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[France]], [[Liechtenstein]], and even a few [[Walser German|Walser people]] from [[Italy]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Language==
===Articles and article titles===
A peculiarity of the Alemannic Wikipedia is the wide range of dialects permitted; all varieties of Alemannic, including [[Swiss German]], [[Swabian German|Swabian]], [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], and all others are accepted. Authors may not normally alter the dialect used by another contributor, though exceptions are made for local topics, in which modifying the text to reflect the local variety is encouraged. Articles may thus be written in a mix of different varieties. Since there is no standardized orthography for Alemannic, spelling rules are quite relaxed. However, contributors are encouraged to adhere to spelling conventions found in the Alemannic-language literature, and introducing new symbols is not tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;[[:gsw:Wikipedia:Artikel#Froge un Antworte zum Dial.C3.A4kt|Wikipedia:Artikel#Froge un Antworte zum Dial.C3.A4kt]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article titles are in Standard German, but display is frequently manipulated to show Alemannic text.

===Language codes===
The code &lt;nowiki&gt;"als"&lt;/nowiki&gt; was used because in 2003 there had been no language code for Alsatian. [[ISO 639-3]] gives four codes for several Alemannic dialects:
* &lt;nowiki&gt;gct&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the code for [[Colonia Tovar dialect|Alemán Coloniero]]
* &lt;nowiki&gt;gsw&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the code for [[Swiss German]], also for Alsatian
* &lt;nowiki&gt;swg&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the code for [[Swabian German]]
* &lt;nowiki&gt;wae&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the code for [[Walser German]]
As all of these four dialects are accepted on the Alemannic Wikipedia, it was decided not to move the Alemannic Wikipedia to gsw.wikipedia.org, even though the code &lt;nowiki&gt;als&lt;/nowiki&gt; stands for [[Tosk Albanian]] in ISO 639-3. To solve this problem a request for a superior code for all Alemannic dialects has been submitted to [[SIL International]] by Alemannic Wikipedians.&lt;ref&gt;look [[:als:Benutzer:Chlämens/Ethnologue|here]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the existence of dedicated ISO 639-3 codes and the possibility of more specific marking with country code subtags, all pages use 'gsw' in the HTML language tag.

===List of dialects that are used on single-dialect pages===
Below is a list of dialects that have a category in [[:als:Kategorie:Wikipedia:Dialekt]] and where that category contains at least one article.

===Other Wikipedias in German dialect===
Alemannic Wikipedia was the first Wikipedia in a German dialect, followed by the [[Bavarian Wikipedia]] and the [[Ripuarian Wikipedia]].

===Alemannic in other Wikimedia projects===
Other Wikimedia projects in Alemanic have also been created, such as an Alemannic Wiktionary, an Alemannic Wikiquote, and an Alemannic Wikibooks. As activity in these projects was low even after years, the community of the Alemannic Wikipedia decided to merge all Alemannic projects and import all contents of the other projects into the Alemannic Wikipedia. Since April 2008 these projects are separate namespaces within the Alemannic Wikipedia. Also an Alemannic Wikisource and an Alemannic Wikinews have been created as separate namespaces within als:wp.

Wikidata supports one language with code 'gsw' and name 'Swiss German'. A proposal to remove it has not been adopted. [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Project_chat/Archive/2016/04#gsw_-_Alemannic.2FSwiss_German_in_labels_and_descriptions.3F].

'''Algerian Jewish Sign Language (AJSL)''', also known as '''Ghardaia Sign Language''', is a moribund [[village sign language]] originally of [[Ghardaïa]], Algeria that is now used in Israel and possibly also in France.&lt;ref name="LanesmanMeir2012"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish community of Ghardaïa emigrated to France and Israel during the years 1943 to 1962.&lt;ref name="Lanesman2016" /&gt; However, because deaf Algerian Jews tended to marry deaf Israelis from other backgrounds, they adopted [[Israeli Sign Language]] (ISL) as their primary language. AJSL is therefore moribund, being used primarily for interaction between deaf immigrants and their hearing siblings and parents. It is thus hearing people who are preserving its use.

Little is known about its use in France.

'''Ambala''' is a [[Sambalic language]] spoken in the [[Philippines]]. It has more than 2,000 speakers (Ramos 2004) and is spoken within [[Aeta]] communities in the [[Zambales|Zambal]] [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]] of [[Subic, Zambales|Subic]], [[San Marcelino, Zambales|San Marcelino]], and [[Castillejos, Zambales|Castillejos]]; in the [[Cities of the Philippines|city]] of [[Olongapo City|Olongapo]]; and in [[Dinalupihan, Bataan]] (''Ethnologue'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13090">In [[computer science]], an '''ambiguous grammar''' is a [[context-free grammar]] for which there exists a [[string (computer science)|string]] that can have more than one [[leftmost derivation]] or [[parse tree]], while an '''unambiguous grammar''' is a context-free grammar for which every valid string has a unique leftmost derivation or parse tree. Many languages admit both ambiguous and unambiguous grammars, while some languages admit only ambiguous grammars. Any non-empty language admits an ambiguous grammar by taking an unambiguous grammar and introducing a duplicate rule or synonym (the only language without ambiguous grammars is the empty language). A language that only admits ambiguous grammars is called an [[#Inherently ambiguous languages|inherently ambiguous language]], and there are inherently ambiguous [[context-free language]]s. [[Deterministic context-free grammar]]s are always unambiguous, and are an important subclass of unambiguous grammars; there are non-deterministic unambiguous grammars, however.

For computer [[programming language]]s, the reference grammar is often ambiguous, due to issues such as the [[#Dangling else|dangling else]] problem. If present, these ambiguities are generally resolved by adding precedence rules or other [[context-sensitive grammar|context-sensitive]] parsing rules, so the overall phrase grammar is unambiguous.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The set of all parse trees for an ambiguous sentence is called a ''parse forest''.&lt;ref&gt;Tomita, Masaru. "[http://anthology.aclweb.org/J/J87/J87-1004.pdf An efficient augmented-context-free parsing algorithm]." Computational linguistics 13.1-2 (1987): 31-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Trivial language===
The simplest example is the following ambiguous grammar for the trivial language, which consists of only the empty string:
:A → A | ε
…meaning that a production can either be itself again, or the empty string. Thus the empty string has leftmost derivations of length 1, 2, 3, and indeed of any length, depending on how many times the rule A → A is used.

This language also has the unambiguous grammar, consisting of a single production rule:
:A → ε
…meaning that the unique production can only produce the empty string, which is the unique string in the language.

In the same way, any grammar for a non-empty language can be made ambiguous by adding duplicates.

===Unary string===
The [[regular language]] of unary strings of a given character, say &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt; (the regular expression &lt;code&gt;a*&lt;/code&gt;), has the unambiguous grammar:
:A → aA | ε
…but also has the ambiguous grammar:
:A → aA | Aa | ε
These correspond to producing a [[right-associative]] tree (for the unambiguous grammar) or allowing both left- and right- association. This is elaborated below.

===Addition and subtraction===
The [[context free grammar]]
:A → A + A | A − A | A * A | a
is ambiguous since there are two leftmost derivations for the string a + a + a:

{| border="0"
|-----
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || A || → A + A
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| A || → A + A
|-----
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ||  || → a + A
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| || → A + A + A (First A is replaced by A+A. Replacement of the second A would yield a similar derivation)
|-----
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ||  || → a + A + A
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| || → a + A + A
|-----
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ||  || → a + a + A
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| || → a + a + A
|-----
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ||  || → a + a + a
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| || → a + a + a
|}

As another example, the grammar is ambiguous since there are two [[parse tree]]s for the string a + a &amp;minus; a:
:[[Image:Leftmostderivations jaredwf.png|Leftmostderivations jaredwf.png]]

The language that it generates, however, is not inherently ambiguous; the following is a non-ambiguous grammar generating the same language:
:A → A + a | A − a | a

===Dangling else===
{{main|Dangling else}}
A common example of ambiguity in computer programming languages is the [[dangling else]] problem. In many languages, the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; in an [[Conditional (computer programming)#If–then(–else)|If–then(–else)]] statement is optional, which results in [[nested conditional]]s having multiple ways of being recognized in terms of the context-free grammar.

Concretely, in many languages one may write conditionals in two valid forms: the if-then form, and the if-then-else form – in effect, making the else clause optional:&lt;ref group=note&gt;The following example uses [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] syntax&lt;/ref&gt;

In a grammar containing the rules

 Statement → '''if''' Condition '''then''' Statement |
             '''if''' Condition '''then''' Statement '''else''' Statement |
             ...
 Condition → ...

some ambiguous phrase structures can appear. The expression
 '''if''' a '''then''' '''if''' b '''then''' s '''else''' s2
can be parsed as either
 '''if''' a '''then''' '''begin''' '''if''' b '''then''' s '''end''' '''else''' s2
or as
 '''if''' a '''then''' '''begin''' '''if''' b '''then''' s '''else''' s2 '''end'''
depending on whether the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; is associated with the first &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; or second &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;.

This is resolved in various ways in different languages. Sometimes the grammar is modified so that it is unambiguous, such as by requiring an &lt;code&gt;endif&lt;/code&gt; statement or making &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; mandatory. In other cases the grammar is left ambiguous, but the ambiguity is resolved by making the overall phrase grammar context-sensitive, such as by associating an &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; with the nearest &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;. In this latter case the grammar is unambiguous, but the context-free grammar is ambiguous.{{clarify|reason=There is no such thing as an 'overall phrase grammar'. The 'nearest-if' rule can possibly be implemented by using a slightly modified, but still context-free grammar.|date=January 2017}}

===An unambiguous grammar with multiple derivations===
It should be noted that the existence of multiple derivations of the same string does not suffice to indicate that the grammar is ambiguous; only multiple ''leftmost'' derivations (or, equivalently, multiple parse trees) indicate ambiguity.

For example, the simple grammar
 S → A + A
 A → 0 | 1
is an unambiguous grammar for the language { 0+0, 0+1, 1+0, 1+1 }. While each of these four strings has only one leftmost derivation, it has two different derivations, for example
 S [[Context-free grammar#Rule application|⇒]] A + A ⇒ 0 + A ⇒ 0 + 0
and
 S ⇒ A + A ⇒ A + 0 ⇒ 0 + 0
Only the former derivation is a leftmost one.

==Recognizing ambiguous grammars==
The [[decision problem]] of whether an arbitrary grammar is ambiguous is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] because it can be shown that it is equivalent to the [[Post correspondence problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hopcroft |first1=John |authorlink1=John Hopcroft |last2=Motwani |first2=Rajeev |authorlink2=Rajeev Motwani |last3=Ullman |first3=Jeffrey |authorlink3=Jeffrey Ullman |title=[[Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation]] |edition=2nd |date=2001 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn = 0-201-44124-1 | at = Theorem 9.20, pp. 405–406}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least, there are tools implementing some [[semi-decidable|semi-decision procedure]] for detecting ambiguity of context-free grammars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Axelsson | first1 = Roland | last2 = Heljanko | first2 = Keijo | last3 = Lange | first3 = Martin | year = 2008 | title = Analyzing Context-Free Grammars Using an Incremental SAT Solver | book-title = Proceedings of the 35th [[International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming]] (ICALP'08), Reykjavik, Iceland | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 5126 | pages = 410–422 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-70583-3_34 | subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficiency of context-free grammar parsing is determined by the automaton that accepts it. [[Deterministic context-free grammar]]s are accepted by [[deterministic pushdown automata]] and can be parsed in linear time, for example by the [[LR parser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Knuth | first1 = D. E. | authorlink = Donald Knuth | title = On the translation of languages from left to right | doi = 10.1016/S0019-9958(65)90426-2 | journal = Information and Control | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 607–639 | date=July 1965 | url = http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~mckeeman/cs48/mxcom/doc/knuth65.pdf | accessdate=29 May 2011 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a subset of the [[context-free grammars]] which are accepted by the [[pushdown automaton]] and can be parsed in polynomial time, for example by the [[CYK algorithm]]. Unambiguous context-free grammars can be nondeterministic.

For example, the language of even-length [[palindrome]]s on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the unambiguous context-free grammar S → 0S0 | 1S1 | ε.  An arbitrary string of this language cannot be parsed without reading all its letters first which means that a pushdown automaton has to try alternative state transitions to accommodate for the different possible lengths of a semi-parsed string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hopcroft |first1=John |authorlink1=John Hopcroft |last2=Motwani |first2=Rajeev |authorlink2=Rajeev Motwani |last3=Ullman |first3=Jeffrey |authorlink3=Jeffrey Ullman |title=[[Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation]] |edition=2nd |date=2001 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn = 0-201-44124-1 |pages=249–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, removing grammar ambiguity may produce a deterministic context-free grammar and thus allow for more efficient parsing. Compiler generators such as [[YACC]] include features for resolving some kinds of ambiguity, such as by using the precedence and associativity constraints.

==Inherently ambiguous languages==
The existence of inherently ambiguous languages was proven with [[Parikh's theorem]] in 1961 by [[Rohit Jivanlal Parikh|Rohit Parikh]] in an MIT research report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parikh | first = Rohit | title = Language-generating devices | publisher = Quarterly Progress Report, Research Laboratory of Electronics, MIT | date = January 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some context-free languages (the set of strings that can be generated by a grammar) have both ambiguous and unambiguous grammars, there exist context-free languages for which no unambiguous context-free grammar can exist. An example of an inherently ambiguous language is the union of &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^m c^m d^n | n, m &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^m d^m | n, m &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set is context-free, since the union of two context-free languages is always context-free. But {{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}} give a proof that there is no way to unambiguously parse strings in the (non-context-free) common subset &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^n d^n | n &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;p.99-103, Sect.4.7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Armazic''' is an extinct written [[Aramaic language]] used as a language of administration in the [[South Caucasus]] in the first centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mgaloblishvili|first1=Tamila|last2=Rapp|first2=Stephen H.|editor1-last=van den Berg|editor1-first=Jacob Albert|editor2-last=Kotzé|editor2-first=Annemaré|editor3-last=Nicklas|editor3-first=Tobias|editor4-last=Scopello|editor4-first=Madeleine|title=In Search of Truth: Augustine, Manichaeism and other Gnosticism: Studies for Johannes van Oort at Sixty|date=2011|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-18997-3|page=287f|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qeYE234vlgwC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=%22armazic%22|accessdate=1 September 2014|chapter=Chapter Seventeen: Manichaeism in late antique Georgia?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Armazic language and script were related to the Aramaic of northern [[Mesopotamia]]. The name "Armazic" was introduced by the Georgian scholar [[Giorgi Tsereteli]] in reference to [[Armazi]], an ancient site near [[Mtskheta]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], where several specimens of a local idiom of written Aramaic have been found. Beyond several sites in eastern Georgia, an Armazic-type inscription is also present on the [[temple of Garni]] in [[Armenia]]. The latest specimen of Armazic is an inscription of a 3rd-century plate from Bori, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rapp|first1=Stephen H.|title=The Sasanian World through Georgian Eyes: Caucasia and the Iranian Commonwealth in Late Antique Georgian Literature|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=1472425529|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aulus Gellius''' (c. 125{{snd}}after 180 AD) was a [[Latin]] author and grammarian, who was probably born and certainly brought up in [[Rome]]. He was educated in [[Athens]], after which he returned to Rome. He is famous for his ''Attic Nights'', a [[commonplace book]], or compilation of notes on [[grammar]], [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[antiquarianism]], and other subjects, preserving fragments of the works of many authors who might otherwise be unknown today.

He attended the [[Pythian Games]] in the year 147,&lt;ref name=Holford-Strevens/&gt; and resided for a considerable period in [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="dgrbm"/&gt; Gellius studied rhetoric under [[Titus Castricius]] and [[Sulpicius Apollinaris]]; philosophy under [[Calvisius Taurus]] and [[Peregrinus Proteus]]; and enjoyed also the friendship and instruction of [[Favorinus]], [[Herodes Atticus]], and [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]].&lt;ref name="dgrbm"/&gt;

He returned to Rome, where he held a judicial office.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Gellius, Aulus |volume=11 |page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed by the [[praetor]] to act as an umpire in civil causes, and much of the time which he would gladly have devoted to literary pursuits was consequently occupied by judicial duties.&lt;ref name="dgrbm"/&gt; 

==Writings==
His only known work, the ''Attic Nights'' ({{lang-la|Noctes Atticae}}), takes its name from having been begun during the long nights of a winter which he spent in [[Attica, Greece|Attica]]. He afterwards continued it in Rome. It is compiled out of an ''Adversaria'', or commonplace book, in which he had jotted down everything of unusual interest that he heard in conversation or read in books, and it comprises notes on [[grammar]], [[geometry]], [[philosophy]], [[history]] and many other subjects.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; One story is the fable of [[Androcles]], which is often included in compilations  of [[Aesop]]'s fables, but was not originally from that source. Internal evidence led Leofranc Holford-Strevens to date its publication in or after AD 177.&lt;ref name=Holford-Strevens/&gt;

The work, deliberately devoid of sequence or arrangement, is divided into twenty books. All these have come down to us except the eighth, of which nothing remains but the index. The ''Attic Nights'' are valuable for the insight they afford into the nature of the society and pursuits of those times, and for its many excerpts from works of lost ancient authors.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

The ''Attic Nights'' found many readers in Antiquity. Writers who used this compilation include [[Apuleius]], [[Lactantius]], [[Nonius Marcellus]], [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], the anonymous author of the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', [[Servius]], and [[Augustine]]; but most notable is how Gellius' work was mined by [[Macrobius]], "who, without mentioning his name, quotes Gellius verbatim throughout the ''Saturnalia'', and is thus of the highest value for the text".&lt;ref&gt;P. K. Marshall, "Aulus Gellius" in ''Texts and Transmission: A Survey of the Latin Classics'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
The ''[[editio princeps]]'' was published at [[Rome]] in 1469 by [[Giovanni Andrea Bussi]], bishop-designate of [[Aleria]].&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise indicated, this section is based on Leofranc Holford-Strevens, ''Aulus Gellius'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1988), pp.241-244&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest critical edition was by [[Ludovicus Carrio]] in 1585, published by [[Henricus Stephanus]]; however, the projected commentary fell victim to personal quarrels. Better known is the critical edition of [[Johann Friedrich Gronovius]] ; although he devoted his entire life to work on Gellius, he died in 1671 before his work could be completed. His son [[Jakob Gronovius|Jakob]] published most of his comments on Gellius in 1687, and brought out a revised text with all of his father's comments and other materials at Leyden in 1706; this later work became known as the "Gronoviana". According to Leofranc Holford-Strevens, the "Gronoviana" remained the standard text of Gellius for over a hundred years, until the edition of [[Martin Hertz]] (Berlin, 1883–85; there is also a smaller edition by the same author, Berlin, 1886), revised by C. Hosius, 1903, with bibliography. A volume of selections, with notes and vocabulary, was published by Nall (London, 1888). There is an English translation by W. Beloe (London, 1795), and a French translation (1896).&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Gellius, Aulus|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent English translation is by [[John Carew Rolfe]] (1927) for the [[Loeb Classical Library]].

'''Bactrian''' (Αριαο, ''Aryao'', [[Help:IPA|[arjaːu̯ɔ]]]{{fix|text=?}}) was an [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] language which was spoken in the [[Central Asia]]n region of [[Bactria]] (present-day [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sims-Williams|first1=N|title=Bactrian Language|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bactrian-language|website=Encyclopaedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used as the official language of the [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] and the [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalite]] empires.

==Etymology==
It was long thought that [[Avestan language|Avestan]] represented "Old Bactrian", but this notion had "rightly fallen into discredit by the end of the 19th century".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gershevitch|1983|p=1250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bactrian, which was written predominantly in an alphabet based on the [[Greek script]], was known natively as αριαο ''/arjāu̯ɔ/'' ("[[Arya]]"; an [[endonym]] common amongst Iranian peoples). It has also been known by names such as Greco-Bactrian, [[Kushan]] or Kushano-Bactrian.

Under Kushan rule, Bactria became known as ''Tukhara'' or ''Tokhara'', and later as ''Tokharistan''. When texts in two extinct and [[Tocharian languages|previously unknown Indo-European languages]] were discovered in the [[Tarim Basin]] of China, during the early 20th century, they were linked circumstantially to Tokharistan, and Bactrian was sometimes referred to as "Eteo-Tocharian" (i.e. "true" or "original" Tocharian). By the 1970s, however, it became clear that there was little evidence for such a connection. For instance, the Tarim "Tocharian" languages were part of the so-called "[[centum]] group" within the Indo-European family, and were most closely related to the [[Anatolian languages]], whereas Bactrian was a [[satem]]ised Iranian language.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Classification==
Bactrian is a part of the [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]] [[Language area|areal group]], and shares features with the extinct Middle Iranian languages [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] and [[Khwarezmian language|Khwarezmian]] (Eastern) and [[Parthian language|Parthian]] ([[Western Iranian|Western]]), as well as with the modern Eastern Iranian languages [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Yidgha language|Yidgha]], and [[Munji language|Munji]].&lt;ref&gt;Henning (1960), p. 47. ''Bactrian thus “occupies an intermediary position between Pashto and Yidgha-Munji on the one hand, Sogdian, Choresmian, and Parthian on the other: it is thus in its natural and rightful place in Bactria”.''&lt;/ref&gt; Its genealogical position is unclear.&lt;ref name="Novak"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ľubomir|last=Novák|title=Question of (re)classification of Eastern Iranian languages|journal=Linguistica Brunensia|year=2014|pp=77–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another source, the present-day speakers of Munji, the modern Eastern Iranian language of the Munjan Valley in northeast Afghanistan, display the closest possible linguistic affinity with the Bactrian language.&lt;ref&gt;Waghmar, Burzine K. (2001) 'Bactrian History and Language: An Overview.' Journal of the K. R. Cama Oriental Institute, 64. pp. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Rabatak inscription.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Rabatak inscription]] is an inscription written on a rock in the Bactrian language and the Greek script, which was found in 1993 at the site of [[Robatak, Afghanistan|Rabatak]], near [[Surkh Kotal]] in [[Afghanistan]]. The inscription relates to the rule of the [[Kushan]] emperor [[Kanishka]], and gives remarkable clues on the genealogy of the Kushan dynasty.]]
Following the conquest of Bactria by [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, for about two centuries [[Greek language|Greek]] was the administrative language of his [[Hellenistic]] successors, that is, the [[Seleucid]] and the [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]]s. Eastern [[Scythians|Scythian]] tribes (the [[Saka]], or Sacaraucae of Greek sources) invaded the territory around 140 BC, and at some time after 124 BC, Bactria was overrun by a confederation of tribes belonging to the [[Great Yuezhi]] and [[Bactria#Daxia,_Tukhara_&amp;_Tokharistan|''Tokhari'']]. In the 1st century AD, the Kushana – one of the Yuezhi tribes – founded the ruling dynasty of the [[Kushan Empire]].

The Kushan Empire initially retained the [[Greek language]] for administrative purposes, but soon began to use Bactrian. The Bactrian [[Rabatak inscription]] (discovered in 1993 and deciphered in 2000) records that the Kushan king [[Kanishka]] (c. 127 AD)&lt;ref&gt;Harry Falk (2001), “The yuga of Sphujiddhvaja and the era of the Kuṣâṇas.” Silk Road Art and Archaeology 7: 121–36.p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.silkroadfoundation.org/newsletter/vol10/SilkRoad_10_2012_simswilliams.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; discarded Greek (Ionian) as the language of administration and adopted Bactrian ("Arya language"). The Greek language accordingly vanished from official use and only Bactrian was later attested. The [[Greek script]] however remained and was used to write Bactrian.

The territorial expansion of the Kushans helped propagate Bactrian in other parts of [[Central Asia]] and [[North India]].

In the 3rd century, the Kushan territories west of the [[Indus river]] fell to the [[Sassanid Empire|Sasanians]], and Bactrian began to be influenced by [[Middle Persian]]. Next to [[Pahlavi script]] and (occasionally) [[Brahmi script]], some coinage of this period is still in Greco-Bactrian script. Beginning in the mid-4th century, Bactria and northwestern India yielded to the [[Hephthalite]] tribes. The Hephthalite period is marked by linguistic diversity and in addition to Bactrian, Middle Persian, North Indo-Aryan, Turkish and Latin vocabulary is also attested. The Hephthalites ruled their territories until the 7th century when they were overrun by the Arabs, after which the official use of Bactrian ceased. Although Bactrian briefly survived in other usage, that too eventually ceased, and the latest examples of the language date to the end of the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia: The Development of Sedentary and Nomadic Civilizations, 700 B. C. to A, Part 250 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=9U6RlVVjpakC&amp;pg=PA433 |accessdate=27 March 2013 |year=1994 |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |location= |isbn=9231028464 |page=433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
[[File:Sho uc lc.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Bactrian was predominantly written using the [[Greek script]] with the addition of the letter ''[[Sho (letter)|sho]]'' (here in majuscule and minuscule) to represent the {{IPA|/ʃ/}} sound.]]
Among Indo-Iranian languages, the use of the Greek script is unique to Bactrian. Although ambiguities remain, some of the disadvantages were overcome by using ''[[heta]]'' (&lt;span style="font-family:serif"&gt;Ͱ, ͱ&lt;/span&gt;) for /h/{{cn|date=May 2015}} and by introducing ''[[Sho (letter)|sho]]'' (Ϸ, ϸ) to represent /ʃ/. ''[[Xi (letter)|Xi]]'' (&lt;span style="font-family:serif"&gt;Ξ, ξ&lt;/span&gt;) and ''[[Psi (letter)|psi]]'' (&lt;span style="font-family:serif"&gt;Ψ, ψ&lt;/span&gt;) were not used for writing Bactrian as the ''ks'' and ''ps'' sequences do not occur in Bactrian. They were however probably used to represent numbers (just as other Greek letters were).

The Bactrian language is known from inscriptions, coins, seals, manuscripts, and other documents.

Sites at which Bactrian language inscriptions have been found are (in North-South order) [[Afrasiyab (Samarkand)|Afrasiyab]] in [[Uzbekistan]]; [[Termez|Kara-Tepe]], Airtam, Delbarjin, [[Balkh]], [[Kunduz]], [[Baghlan|Baglan]], [[Surkh Kotal|Ratabak/Surkh Kotal]], Oruzgan, [[Kabul]], Dasht-e Navur, [[Ghazni]], Jagatu in [[Afghanistan]]; and [[Islamabad]], [[Shatial|Shatial Bridge]] and [[Tochi Valley]] in [[Pakistan]]. 
{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Of eight known manuscript fragments in Greco-Bactrian script, one is from [[Loulan|Lou-lan]] and seven from Toyoq, where they were discovered by the second and third [[Turpan]] expeditions under [[Albert von Le Coq]]. One of these may be a [[Buddhist]] text. One other manuscript, in [[Manichaean alphabet|Manichaean script]], was found at [[Gaochang|Qočo]] by [[Mary Boyce]] in 1958.

[[File:Kushan script.jpg|thumb|Variations of the [[Greek alphabet]] (narrow columns) in the [[Kushan]] script (wide columns).]]
Over 150 legal documents, accounts, letters and Buddhist texts have surfaced since the 1990s, several of them currently a part of the collection of [[Nasser Khalili]]. These have greatly increased the detail in which Bactrian is currently known.

==Phonology==
The phonology of Bactrian is not known with certainty, due to the limitations of the native scripts.

A major difficulty in determining Bactrian phonology is that affricates and voiced stops were not consistently distinguished from the corresponding fricatives in the Greek script.
* [[Proto-Iranian]] *b, *d, *g have generally become spirants, as in most other Eastern Iranian languages. A distinctive feature of Bactrian, shared within the Iranian languages with Munji, Yidgha and Pashto, is the development of Proto-Iranian *d &gt; *ð further to {{IPA|/l/}}, which may have been areal in nature.&lt;ref name="Novak"/&gt; Original *d remains only in a few consonant clusters, e.g. *bandaka &gt; ''βανδαγο'' 'servant', *dugdā &gt; ''λογδο'' 'daughter'. The clusters {{IPA|/lr/}} and {{IPA|/rl/}} appear in earlier Bactrian, but revert to {{IPA|/dr/}}, {{IPA|/rd/}} later, e.g. *drauga &gt; ''λρωγο'' (4th to 5th century) &gt;  ''δδρωρο'' (7th to 8th century) 'lie, falsehood'.{{sfn|Gholami|2010|pp=18–19}}
* Proto-Iranian *p, *t, *č, *k have become voiced between vowels, and after a nasal consonant or *r.
** Inside a word, the digraphs ''ββ'', ''δδ'' for original voiceless *p, *t can be found, which probably represent [b], [d]. The former is attested only in a single word, ''αββο'' 'water'. Manichaean Bactrian appears to only have had /v/ in native vocabulary. According to Gholami, instances of single ''δ'' may indicate a fricative pronunciation, {{IPA|[ð]}}.{{sfn|Gholami|2010|p=10}}
** ''γ'' appears to stand for both the stop {{IPA|[g]}} and the fricative {{IPA|[ɣ]}}, but it is unclear if a contrast existed, and which instances are which. Evidence from the Manichaean script suggests that ''γ'' from *k may have been {{IPA|/g/}} and ''γ'' from *g may have been {{IPA|/ɣ/}}. According to Greek orthographic practices, ''γγ'' represents {{IPA|[ŋg]}}.{{sfn|Gholami|2010|pp=11–12}}
* ''σ'' may continue both Proto-Iranian *c &gt; *s and *č, and the Manichaean script confirms that it represents two phonemes, likely /s/ and /ts/.{{sfn|Gholami|2010|p=12}}
* ''ζ'' may continue similarly on one hand Proto-Iranian *dz &gt; *z, and on the other *ǰ and *č, and it represents at least /z/ and /dz/. This distinction is again confirmed by the Manichaean script. Also a third counterpart of ''ζ'' is found in Manichaean Bactrian, possibly representing {{IPA|/ʒ/}}.

The status of ''θ'' is unclear; it only appears in the word ''ιθαο'' 'thus, also', which may be a loanword from another Iranian language. In most positions Proto-Iranian *θ becomes {{IPA|/h/}} (written ''υ''), or is lost, e.g. *puθra- &gt; ''πουρο'' 'son'.{{sfn|Gholami|2010|p=13}} The cluster *θw, however, appears to become {{IPA|/lf/}}, e.g. *wikāθwan &gt; ''οιγαλφο'' 'witness'.{{sfn|Gholami|2010|p=25}}

''ϸ'' continues, in addition to Proto-Iranian *š, also Proto-Iranian *s in the clusters *sr, *str, *rst. In several cases Proto-Iranian *š however becomes {{IPA|/h/}} or is lost; the distribution is unclear. E.g. *snušā &gt; ''ασνωυο'' 'daughter-in-law', *aštā &gt; ''αταο'' 'eight', *xšāθriya &gt; ''χαρο'' 'ruler', *pašman- &gt; ''παμανο'' 'wool'.

The Greek script does not consistently represent vowel length. Fewer vowel contrasts yet are found in the Manichaean script, but short {{IPA|/a/}} and long {{IPA|/aː/}} are distinguished in it, suggesting that Bactrian generally retains the Proto-Iranian vowel length contrast.

It is not clear if ''ο'' might represent short {{IPA|[o]}} in addition to {{IPA|[u]}}, and if any contrast existed. Short {{IPA|[o]}} may have occurred at least as a reflex of *a followed by a lost *u in the next syllable, e.g. *madu &gt; ''μολο'' 'wine', *pasu &gt; ''ποσο'' 'sheep'. Short {{IPA|[e]}} is also rare. By contrast, long {{IPA|/eː/}}, {{IPA|/oː/}} are well established as reflexes of Proto-Iranian diphthongs and certain vowel-semivowel sequences: ''η'' &lt; *ai, *aya, *iya; ''ω'' &lt; *au, *awa.

An epenthetic vowel {{IPA|[ə]}} (written ''α'') is inserted before word-initial [[consonant cluster]]s.

Original word-final vowels and word-initial vowels in open syllables were generally lost. A word-final ''ο'' is normally written, but this was probably silent, and it is appended even after retained word-final vowels: e.g. *aštā &gt; ''αταο'' 'eight', likely pronounced {{IPA|/ataː/}}.

The Proto-Iranian syllabic rhotic *r̥ is lost in Bactrian, and is reflected as ''ορ'' adjacent to labial consonants, ''ιρ'' elsewhere; this agrees with the development in the western Iranian languages [[Parthian language|Parthian]] and [[Middle Persian]].

'''Buginese''' or '''Bugis''' ({{lang|bug-Latn|Basa Ugi}}, elsewhere also ''Bahasa Bugis'', ''Bugis'', ''Bugi'', ''De'') is a language spoken by about five million people mainly in the southern part of [[Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
The word Buginese derives from the word ''Bahasa [[Bugis]]'' in [[Malay Language|Malay]]. In Buginese, it is called {{lang|bug-Latn|Basa Ugi}} while the Bugis people are called {{lang|bug-Latn|To Ugi}}. {{lang|bug-Latn|Ugi}} is taken from the name to the first king of Cina, an ancient Bugis kingdom, ''La Sattumpugi.'' ''To Ugi'' basically means "the followers of La Sattumpugi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Bugis-Makassarese: From Agrarian Farmers to Adventurous Seafarers|journal=Aboriginal, Australia, Marege’, Bugis-Makassar, Transformation|pages=2|author=T. Ambo, T. Joeharnani|publisher=Universitas Hassanuddin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the early history of this language due to the lack of written records. The earliest written record of this language is [[Sureq Galigo]], the epic creation myth of the Bugis people.

Another written source of Buginese is [[Lontara]], a term which refers to the traditional script and historical record as well. The earliest historical record of Lontara dates to around the 17th century, and  being influenced by myths, is not considered a reliable historical source.

Prior to the Dutch arrival in the 18th century, a missionary, B.F. Matthews, translated the Bible into Buginese, which made him the first European to acquire knowledge of the language. He was also one of the first Europeans to master [[Makassar language|Makassarese]]. The dictionaries and grammar books compiled by him, and the literature and folkfore texts he published, remain basic sources of information about both languages.

Upon [[Dutch East Indies|colonization by the Dutch]], a number of [[Bugis]] fled from their home area of South Sulawesi seeking a better life. This led to the existence of small groups of Buginese speakers throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].

==Classification==
Buginese belongs to [[South Sulawesi languages|South Sulawesi]] subgroup of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family. Within the [[South Sulawesi languages|South Sulawesi]] subgroup, it is most closely related to [[Campalagian language|Campalagian]].

==Geographical distribution==
[[Image:M101703 id-1-.gif|right|150px|thumb|The green shaded area shows the concentration of Buginese speakers.]]

Most of the native speakers (around 3 million) are concentrated in [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]] but there are small groups of Buginese speakers in the island of [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Samarinda]] and east [[Sumatra]] of [[Indonesia]], east [[Sabah]] and [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Malaysia]] and South [[Philippines]]. This [[Bugis]] diaspora are the result of migration since 17th centuries that was mainly driven by continuous warfare situations. (The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] direct colonization started in early 20th century.)

== Phonology ==

Buginese has six vowels: a, e, i, o, u, and the central vowel ə.

The following table gives the consonant phonemes of Buginese together with their representation in [[Lontara script]].

When Buginese is written in Latin script, general Indonesian spelling conventions are applied: [ŋ] is represented by ″ny″, [ŋ] by ″ng″, [ɟ] by ″j″, [j] by ″y″. The glottal stop [ʔ] is usually represented by an apostrophe (e.g. ''ana′'' [anaʔ] "child"), but occasionally "q" is also used.

==Writing system==
{{main|Lontara alphabet}}
Buginese was traditionally written using the [[Lontara script]], of the [[Brahmic family]], which is also used for the [[Makassar language]] and the [[Mandar language]]. The name [[Lontara]] derives from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word for the [[palmyra palm]], {{lang|ms|lontar}}, the leaves of which are the traditional material for manuscripts in [[India]], [[South East Asia]] and [[Indonesia]]. Today, however, it is often written using the [[Latin script]].

===The Buginese Lontara===
The Buginese lontara (locally known as {{lang|bug-Latn|Aksara Ugi}}) has a slightly different pronunciation from the other [[lontara]]s like the Makassarese. Like other Indic scripts, it also utilizes diacritics to distinguish the vowels [i], [u], [e], [o] and [ə] from the default inherent vowel /a/ (actually pronounced [ɔ]) implicitly represented in all base consonant letters (including the zero-consonant ''a'').

But unlike most other Brahmic scripts of India, the Buginese script traditionally does not have any [[virama]] sign (or alternate half-form for vowel-less consonants, or subjoined form for non-initial consonants in clusters) to suppress the inherent vowel, so it is normally impossible to write consonant clusters (a few ones were added later, derived from ligatures, to mark the [[prenasalized consonant|prenasalization]]), geminated consonants or final consonants.

Older texts, however, usually did not use diacritics at all, and readers were expected to identify words from context and thus provide the correct pronunciation. As one might expect, this led to erroneous readings; for example, {{lang|bug-Latn|bolo}} could be misread as {{lang|bug-Latn|bala}} by new readers.

==Dialects and subdialects==
The Bugis still distinguish themselves according to their major precolony states ([[Bone state|Bone]], [[Wajo Kingdom|Wajo]], [[Soppeng]] and [[Sidenreng]]) or groups of petty states (around [[Pare-Pare]], [[Sinjai]] and [[Suppa]].) The languages of these areas, with their relatively minor differences from one another, have been largely recognized by linguists as constituting dialects: recent linguistic research has identified eleven of them, most comprising two or more sub-dialects.

This is a partial list of Buginese dialects: Bone (Palakka, Dua Boccoe, Mare), Pangkep (Pangkajane), Camba, Sidrap (Sidenreng, North Pinrang, Alitta), Pasangkayu (Ugi Riawa), Sinjai (Enna, Palattae, Bulukumba), Soppeng (Kessi), Wajo, Barru (Pare-Pare, Nepo, Soppeng Riaja, Tompo, Tanete), Sawitto (Pinrang), Luwu (Luwu, Bua Ponrang, Wara, Malangke-Ussu).

'''Caesarism''' has been used in a variety of ways over the centuries. The various uses of 'Caesarism' are documented below.&lt;ref name=c/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Caesarism |title=Caesarism |publisher=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used by proponents of it, but it has also been used in a [[pejorative]] manner.

==History of the term==

The first documented use of the word is in the 19th century when it was used by German historian [[Johann Friedrich Böhmer]] in 1846 to describe the state subordinating the Church to its control. &lt;ref name=c&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://books.google.ie/books?id=R86cltC2mNMC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=caesarism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O0q3oInTKT&amp;sig=QMFrXnnnITQE261dNkIdDmJRmHg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfzbP9iaHRAhWlAsAKHeK_Ay84ChDoAQgbMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=caesarism&amp;f=false |title=Caesarism, Charisma and Fate: Historical Sources and Modern Resonances in the Work of Max Weber |author=Peter Baehr |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850 it was used again by [[Auguste Romieu]] but it had a different meaning. Romieu defined Caesarism as the rule of military warlords.&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

Sociologist [[Peter Baehr]] writes "following Romieu's polemic "Caesarism"...[Caesarism] gained vogue status". In 1857 religious writer [[Orestes Brownson]] used it to mean [[monarchical absolutism]].&lt;ref name=c/&gt; In 1858 the [[Westminster Review]] wrote "clumsy eulogies of Caesarism as incarnate in the dynasty of Bonaparte"&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

[[Benjamin Disraeli]] was accused of Caesarism in March 1878 when, in anticipation of war with Russia, he mobilised British reserves and called Indian troops to [[Malta]]. [[G.&amp;nbsp;K. Chesterton]] made one of the most ringing denunciations of Caesarism in his work [[Heretics (book)|''Heretics'']], calling it "the worst form of slavery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/470/470-h/470-h.htm#chap19 |title=Heretics |author=G.K. Chesterton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Max Weber]] believed that every [[mass democracy]] went in a Caesarist direction. Professor of law Gerhard Casper writes "Weber employed the      term to stress, [[inter alia]], the [[plebiscitary]] character of elections, disdain for parliament, the non-toleration of autonomous powers within the government and a failure to attract or suffer independent political minds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://law.stanford.edu/publications/caesarism-in-democratic-politics-reflections-on-max-weber/ |title=Caesarism in Democratic Politics: Reflections on Max Weber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A so-called "democratic" form of Caesarism has been advocated by theorists like [[Venezuela]]'s [[Laureano Vallenilla Lanz]] in ''Cesarismo Democrático'' (1919).&lt;ref name=c/&gt;&lt;ref name=diego&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Vacano|first1=Diego A.|title=The Color of Citizenship: Race, Modernity and Latin American / Hispanic Political Thought|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2012 | location=Oxford, UK|isbn=9780199746668|pages=83–111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjsjyJhSepoC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=Laureano+Vallenilla+Lanz+caesarism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Oofowg4Ovt&amp;sig=kiY9AMw3cbL35CgIt3AGBFWONaQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_8YXVNvrCOaHsQSB7IKQCA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Laureano%20Vallenilla%20Lanz%20caesarism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous person who themselves espoused Caesarism, was [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who admired and emulated Caesar during his rule in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31974">A '''clitic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɪ|t|ᵻ|k}}, backformed from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἐγκλιτικός}} {{grc-transl|ἐγκλιτικός}} "leaning" or "enclitic") is a [[morpheme]] in [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]] that has syntactic characteristics of a word, but depends [[phonology|phonologically]] on another word or phrase. In this sense, it is syntactically independent but phonologically dependent—always attached to a host.&lt;ref name="sil-clitic"&gt;SIL International (2003). SIL Glossary of Linguistic Terms: What is a clitic? "This page is an extract from the LinguaLinks Library, Version 5.0 published on CD-ROM by SIL International, 2003." Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsACliticGrammar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-04-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040510110313/http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsACliticGrammar.htm |archivedate=2004-05-10 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the Greek for ''leaning''.&lt;ref name="crystal"&gt;Crystal, David. A First Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics. Boulder, CO: Westview, 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A clitic is pronounced like an [[affix]], but plays a syntactic role at the [[phrase]] level.  In other words, clitics have the ''form'' of affixes, but the distribution of [[function word]]s. For example, the contracted forms of the auxiliary verbs in ''I'm'' and ''we've'' are clitics.

Clitics can belong to any grammatical category, although they are commonly [[pronoun]]s, [[determiner]]s, or [[adposition]]s. Note that [[orthography]] is not always a good guide for distinguishing clitics from affixes: clitics may be written as separate words, but sometimes they are joined to the word they depend on (like the Latin clitic ''-que'', meaning "and"), or separated by special characters such as [[hyphen]]s or [[apostrophe]]s (like the English clitic ''’s'' in "it's" for "it has" or "it is").

==Classification==
{{confusing|section|reason=it is unclear which words or parts of words are clitics in the examples|date=July 2014}}

Clitics fall into various categories depending on their position in relation to the word they connect to.&lt;ref name="crystal" /&gt;

=== Proclitic ===

A proclitic appears before its host.&lt;ref name="crystal" /&gt; It is common in Romance languages. For example, in French, there is "il '''s''''est réveillé" ("he woke up"), or "je '''t''''aime" ("I love you").

=== Enclitic ===

An enclitic appears after its host.&lt;ref name="crystal" /&gt;
*[[Latin]]: [[SPQR|Senatus ''Populus'''''que''' Romanus]]
::"Senate ''people''-'''and''' Roman" = "The Senate and people of Rome"
*[[Ancient Greek]]: ''ánthrōpoí'' ('''te''') ''theoí'' '''te'''
:::"''people'' ('''and''') ''gods'' '''and'''" = "(both) men and gods"
*[[Sanskrit]]: ''naro gajaś'' '''ca''' = नरः गजः च &gt; with [[sandhi]], नरो गजश्च 
:::"''the man the elephant '''and'''" = "the man and the elephant"
*Sanskrit: [[Namaste|Namas'''te''']] &lt; ''namaḥ'' + ''te'', ([[Devanagari]]: नमस् + ते = नमस्ते), with sandhi change ''namaḥ'' &gt; ''namas''.
::: "''bowing to you''"
*[[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Nevím, chtělo'''-li by se mi si to tam však''' také vyzkoušet''.
::"'''However''' ('''''však'''''), I do not know (''nevím''), '''if''' ('''''-li''''') '''it''' '''would''' ('''''by''''') want (''chtělo '''se''''') to try (''vyzkoušet '''si''''') '''it''' ('''''to''''') '''to me''' ('''''mi''''') '''there''' ('''''tam''''') as well (''také'')." (= However, I'm not sure if I would like to try it there as well.)
*[[Telugu language|Telugu]]: ''idi nā puvvu'' = ఇది నా పువ్వు (This is my flower). With enclitic '''ē''', which indicates certainty, this sentence becomes
::Idi nā puvv'''ē''' = ఇది నా పువ్వే (This is ''certainly'' my flower)

=== Mesoclitic ===

A mesoclitic appears between the [[Word stem|stem]] of the host and other affixes. For example, in Portuguese, ''conquistar-'''se'''-á'' ("it will be conquered"), ''dá-'''lo'''-ei'' ("I will give it"), ''matá-'''la'''-ia'' ("he/she/it would kill her"). These are found much more often in writing than in speech. It is even possible to use two pronouns inside the verb, as in ''dar-'''no'''-'''lo'''-á'' ("he/she/it will give it to us"), or ''dar-'''ta'''-ei'' (''ta'' = ''te'' + ''a'', "I will give it/her to you"). As in other Romance languages, the Portuguese synthetic future tense comes from the merging of the infinitive and the corresponding finite forms of the verb ''haver'' (from Latin ''habēre''), which explains the possibility of separating it from the infinitive.

=== Endoclitic ===

The endoclitic splits apart the root and is inserted between the two pieces. Endoclitics defy the [[Lexical Integrity Hypothesis]] (or Lexicalist hypothesis) and so were long thought impossible. However, evidence from the [[Udi language]] suggests that they exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Endoclitics are also found in [[Pashto language|Pashto]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig Kopris|Craig A. Kopris]] &amp; Anthony R.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction==
One important distinction divides the broad term 'clitics' into two categories, simple clitics and special clitics.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;Miller, Philip H. "Clitics and Phrasal Affixes." Clitics and Constituents in Phrase Structure Grammar. New York: Garland, 1992. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is, however, disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Bermúdez-Otero, Ricardo &amp; John Payne (2011). There are no special clitics. In Alexandra Galani, Glyn Hicks &amp; George Tsoulas (eds), ''Morphology and its interfaces'' (Linguistik Aktuell 178), 57–96. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Simple clitics ===

Simple clitics are free morphemes, meaning they can stand alone in a phrase or sentence.{{Example needed}} They are unaccented and thus phonologically dependent upon a nearby word. They only derive meaning from this "host".&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt;

=== Special clitics ===

Special clitics are morphemes that are bound to the word they are dependent upon, meaning they exist as a part of their host.{{Example needed}} This form, which is unaccented, represents a variant of a free form that does carry stress. While the two variants carry similar meaning and phonological makeup, the special clitic is bound to a host word and unaccented.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt;

==Properties==
Some clitics can be understood as elements undergoing a historical process of [[grammaticalization]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

{{in5}}lexical item → clitic → affix&lt;ref name="klavans"&gt;[[Judith Klavans|Klavans, Judith L.]] On Clitics and Cliticization: The Interaction of Morphology, Phonology, and Syntax. New York: Garland Pub., 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this model from [[Judith Klavans]], an autonomous lexical item in a particular context loses the properties of a fully independent word over time and acquires the properties of a morphological affix (prefix, suffix, infix, etc.). At any intermediate stage of this evolutionary process, the element in question can be described as a "clitic". As a result, this term ends up being applied to a highly heterogeneous class of elements, presenting different combinations of word-like and affix-like properties.&lt;ref name="klavans" /&gt;

===Prosody===
One characteristic shared by many clitics is a lack of [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] independence. A clitic attaches to an adjacent word, known as its ''host''. Orthographic conventions treat clitics in different ways: Some are written as separate words, some are written as one word with their hosts, and some are attached to their hosts, but set off by punctuation (a hyphen or an apostrophe, for example).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Comparison with affixes===
Although the term "clitic" can be used descriptively to refer to any element whose grammatical status is somewhere in between a typical word and a typical affix, linguists have proposed various definitions of "clitic" as a technical term. One common approach is to treat clitics as words that are prosodically deficient: they cannot appear without a host, and they can only form an accentual unit in combination with their host. The term "'''postlexical clitic'''" is used for this narrower sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Klavans, Judith L. On Clitics and Cliticization: The Interaction of Morphology, Phonology, and Syntax. New York: Garland Pub., 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this basic definition, further criteria are needed to establish a dividing line between postlexical clitics and morphological affixes, since both are characterized by a lack of prosodic autonomy. There is no natural, clear-cut boundary between the two categories (since from a historical point of view, a given form can move gradually from one to the other by morphologization). However, by identifying clusters of observable properties that are associated with core examples of clitics on the one hand, and core examples of affixes on the other, one can pick out a battery of tests that provide an empirical foundation for a clitic/affix distinction.

An affix syntactically and [[phonology|phonologically]] attaches to a base [[morpheme]] of a limited [[part of speech]], such as a verb, to form a new word.  A clitic syntactically functions above the word level, on the [[phrase]] or [[clause]] level, and attaches only phonetically to the first, last, or only word in the phrase or clause, whichever part of speech the word belongs to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Zwicky
 | first = Arnold
 | authorlink = Arnold Zwicky
 | year = 1977
 | title = On Clitics
 | publisher = Indiana University Linguistics Club
 | location = Bloomington}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The results of applying these criteria sometimes reveal that elements that have traditionally been called "clitics" actually have the status of affixes (e.g., the Romance pronominal clitics discussed [[#Romance languages|below]]).&lt;ref name=Spencer/&gt;

Zwicky and Pullum postulated five characteristics that distinguish clitics from affixes:&lt;ref name=Spencer/&gt;
# Clitics do not select their hosts.  That is, they are "promiscuous", attaching to whichever word happens to be in the right place.  Affixes do select their host:  They only attach to the word they are connected to semantically, and generally attach to a particular part of speech.
# Clitics do not exhibit arbitrary gaps.  Affixes, on the other hand, are often lexicalized and may simply not occur with certain words.  (English plural -s, for example, does not occur with "child".)
# Clitics do not exhibit morphophonological idiosyncrasies.  That is, they follow the morphophonological rules of the rest of the language.  Affixes may be irregular in this regard.
# Clitics do not exhibit semantic idiosyncrasies.  That is, the meaning of the phrase-plus-clitic is predictable from the meanings of the phrase and the clitic.  Affixes may have irregular meanings.
# Clitics can attach to material already containing clitics (and affixes).  Affixes can attach to other affixes, but not to material containing clitics.
An example of differing analyses by different linguists is the discussion of the possessive ('s) in English, some linguists treating it as an affix, while others treat it as a special clitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clitics: An Introduction | first1=Andrew |last1=Spencer| first2=Ana R. |last2=Luis |isbn=9781139560313 |url= https://books.google.de/books?id=wLYgAwAAQBAJ |date= 2012 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |pages=292–293|quote=There are two alternatives that have been explored in recent literature.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Comparison with words===
Similar to the discussion above, clitics must be distinguishable from words. Linguists have proposed a number of tests to differentiate between the two categories. Some tests, specifically, are based upon the understanding that when comparing the two, clitics resemble affixes, while words resemble syntactic phrases. Clitics and words resemble different categories, in the sense that they share certain properties. Six such tests are described below. These, of course, are not the only ways to differentiate between words and clitics.&lt;ref name="zwicky"&gt;Zwicky, Arnold M. "Clitics and Particles." Language 61.2 (1985): 283-305. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

#If a morpheme is bound to a word and can never occur in complete isolation, then it is likely a clitic. In contrast, a word is not bound and can appear on its own.
#If the addition of a morpheme to a word prevents further affixation, then it is likely a clitic.
#If a morpheme combines with single words to convey a further degree of meaning, then it is likely a clitic. A word combines with a group of words or phrases to denote further meaning.{{Contradiction inline|reason=Further above it is said that clitics work on the phrase level. The English possessive, for example, attaches to a complete phrase.|date=October 2014}}
#If a morpheme must be in a certain order with respect to other morphemes within the construction, then it is likely a clitic. Independent words enjoy free ordering with respect to other words, within the confines of the word order of the language.
#If a morpheme’s allowable behavior is determined by one principle, it is likely a clitic. For example, "a" proceeds indefinite nouns in English. Words can rarely be described with one such description.
#In general, words are more morphologically complex than clitics. Clitics are rarely composed of more than one morpheme.&lt;ref name="zwicky" /&gt;

===Word order&lt;!--'Wackernagel's Law' and 'Wackernagel's law' redirect here--&gt;===
Clitics do not always appear next to the word or phrase that they are associated with grammatically. They may be subject to global word order constraints that act on the entire sentence. Many [[Indo-European languages]], for example, obey '''Wackernagel's law'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (named after [[Jacob Wackernagel]]), which requires clitics to appear in "second position", after the first syntactic phrase or the first stressed word in a clause:&lt;ref name="klavans" /&gt;
*[[Latin language|Latin]] had three enclitics that appeared in second or third position of a clause: ''enim'' 'indeed, for', ''autem'' 'but, moreover', ''vero'' 'however'.  For example, ''quis enim potest negare?'' (from [[Martial]]'s epigram LXIV, literally "who indeed can deny [her riches]?"). Spevak (2010) reports that in her corpus of [[Caesar]], [[Cicero]] and [[Sallust]], these three words appear in such position in 100% of the cases.&lt;ref&gt;Spevak, Olga (2010).

[[English language|English]] enclitics include the contracted versions of auxiliary verbs, as in ''I'm'' and ''we've''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Huddleston |first1=Rodney |authorlink1=Rodney Huddleston

&lt;/ref&gt; Some also regard the [[English possessive|possessive marker]], as in ''The Queen of England's crown'' as an enclitic, rather than a (phrasal) genitival inflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Huddleston |first1=Rodney |authorlink1=Rodney Huddleston|last2= Pullum |first2= Geoffrey |authorlink2=Geoffrey Pullum|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-43146-8|pages=480–481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consider the [[English articles]] ''a, an, the'' and the [[Uses_of_English_verb_forms#To-infinitive|infinitive marker]] ''to'' proclitics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/~zwicky/what-is-a-clitic.pdf|title=What is a clitic?|author=|date=|website=stanford.edu|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative marker ''n’t'' as in ''couldn’t'' etc. is typically considered a clitic that developed from the lexical item ''not''. Linguists [[Arnold Zwicky]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum]] argue, however, that the form has the properties of an affix rather than a syntactically independent clitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Other Germanic languages====
{{dubious|date=July 2013}}
*[[Old Norse]]: The definite article was the enclitic ''-inn'', ''-in'', ''-itt'' (masculine, feminine and neuter nominative singular), as in ''álfrinn'' "the elf", ''gjǫfin'' "the gift", and ''tréit'' "the tree", an abbreviated form of the independent pronoun ''hinn'', [[cognate]] of the German pronoun ''jener''. It was fully declined for gender, case and number. Since both the noun and enclitic were declined, this led to "double declension". The situation remains similar in modern [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], but in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], the enclitics have become [[Suffix#Inflectional suffixes|endings]]. Old Norse had also some enclitics of personal pronouns that were attached to verbs. These were ''-sk'' (from ''sik''), ''-mk'' (from ''mik''), ''-k'' (from ''ek''), and ''-ðu'' / ''-du'' / ''-tu'' (from ''þú''). These could even be stacked up, e.g. "fásktu" (from Hávamál, stanza 116).
*[[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''&amp;#39;t'' definite article of neuter nouns and third person singular neuter pronoun, ''&amp;#39;k'' first person pronoun, ''je'' second person singular pronoun, ''ie'' third person masculine singular pronoun, ''ze'' third person plural pronoun
* [[Plautdietsch]]: ''"Deit'a't vondoag?"'': "Will he do it today?"
*[[Gothic language|Gothic]]: Sentence clitics appear in second position in accordance with [[Wackernagel's Law]], including ''-u'' ([[yes-no question]]), ''-uh'' "and", ''þan'' "then", ''ƕa'' "anything", for example ''ab-'''u''' þus silbin'' "of thyself?". Multiple clitics can be stacked up, and split a [[preverb]] from the rest of the verb if the preverb comes at the beginning of the clause, e.g. ''diz-'''uh-þan'''-sat ijōs'' "and then he seized them (fem.)", ''ga-'''u-ƕa'''-sēƕi'' "whether he saw anything".

===Romance languages===
In [[Romance languages]], some feel the [[object (grammar)|object]] [[personal pronoun]] forms are clitics. Others consider them affixes, as they only attach to the verb they are the object of.&lt;ref name=Spencer&gt;Andrew Spencer and Ana Luís, "The canonical clitic".  In Brown, Chumakina, &amp; Corbett, eds. ''Canonical Morphology and Syntax''.  Oxford University Press, pp. 123–150.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no general agreement on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diplist.it/mmm8/handout/Gaglia_Schwarze.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518102639/http://www.diplist.it/mmm8/handout/Gaglia_Schwarze.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Spanish object pronouns]], for example:

*'''''lo''' atamos'' {{IPA|['''lo'''aˈtamos]}} ("'''it''' tied-&lt;small&gt;1PL&lt;/small&gt;" = "we tied it" or "we tied him"; can only occur with the verb it is the object of)
*''dá'''melo''''' {{IPA|[ˈda'''melo''']}} ("give '''me it'''")

Colloquial [[European Portuguese]] allows object suffixes before the conditional and future suffixes of the verbs:&lt;ref&gt;

Colloquial [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] of Brazil and Portugal and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] of the former [[Gran Colombia]] allow ser to be conjugated as a verbal clitic adverbial adjunct to emphasize the importance of the phrase compared to its context, or with the meaning of "really" or "in truth":&lt;ref&gt;

*''Ele estava '''era''' gordo'' ("''He was '''was''' fat''" – "He was very fat").
*''Ele ligou '''é''' para Paula'' ("''He phoned '''is''' Paula''" – "He phoned Paula (''with emphasis'')").

Note that this clitic form is only for the verb '''ser''' and is restricted to only third-person singular conjugations. It is not used as a verb in the grammar of the sentence but introduces prepositional phrases and adds emphasis. It does not need to concord with the tense of the main verb, as in the second example, and can be usually removed from the sentence without affecting the simple meaning.

===Proto-Indo-European===
In the [[Indo-European language]]s, some clitics can be traced back to [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]: for example, *''{{PIE|-kʷe}}'' is the original form of [[Sanskrit]] ''[[wikt:च|च]]'' (''-ca''), [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:τε|τε]]'' (''-te''), and [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:que#Latin|-que]]''.
*Latin: ''[[wikt:-que#Latin|-que]]'' "and", ''[[wikt:-ve#Latin|-ve]]'' "or", ''[[wikt:-ne#Latin|-ne]]'' ([[yes-no question]])
*Greek: ''[[wikt:τε|τε]]'' "and", ''[[wikt:δέ|δέ]]'' "but", ''[[wikt:γάρ|γάρ]]'' "for" (in a logical argument), ''[[wikt:οὖν|οὖν]]'' "therefore"

===Slavic languages===
*[[Russian language|Russian]]: [[wikt:ли|ли]] (yes-no question), [[wikt:же|же]] (emphasis), то (emphasis), [[wikt:не|не]] "not" (proclitic), [[wikt:бы|бы]] (subjunctive)
* [[Czech language|Czech]]: special clitics: weak personal and reflexive pronouns (''mu'', "him"), certain auxiliary verbs (''by'', "would"), and various short particles and adverbs (''tu'', "here"; ''ale'', "though"). "''Nepodařilo '''by se mi mu to''' dát''" "I would not succeed in giving it to him". In addition there are various simple clitics including short prepositions.
* [[Polish language|Polish]]: ''[[wikt:by|-by]]'' (conditional mood particle), ''[[wikt:się|się]]'' (reflexive, also modifies meaning of certain verbs), ''[[wikt:no|no]]'' and ''[[wikt:że|-że]]'' (emphasis), ''-m, -ś, -śmy, -ście'' (personal auxiliary), ''mi, ci, cię, go, mu'' &amp;c. (unstressed personal pronouns in oblique cases)
* [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: the [[reflexive pronoun]] forms ''si'' and ''se'', ''li'' (yes-no question), unemphasized [[present]] and [[aorist]] tense forms of ''biti'' ("to be"; ''sam, si, je, smo, ste, su''; and ''bih, bi, bi, bismo, biste, bi'', for the respective tense), unemphasized [[personal pronoun]]s in genitive (''me, te, ga, je, nas, vas, ih''), dative (''mi, ti, mu, joj, nam, vam, im'') and accusative (''me, te, ga (nj), je (ju), nas, vas, ih''), and unemphasized present tense of ''htjeti'' ("want/will"; ''ću, ćeš, će, ćemo, ćete, će'')

==Other languages==
*[[Arabic language|Arabic]]: Suffixes standing for direct object pronouns and/or indirect object pronouns (as found in Indo-European languages) are suffixed to verbs, possessive determiners are suffixed to nouns, and pronouns are suffixed to particles.
*[[Finnish language|Finnish]]: Finnish has seven clitics, which change according to the [[Vowel_harmony#Finnish|vowel harmony]]: ''-kO'' (''-ko ~ -kö''), ''-kA'' (''-ka ~ -kä''), ''-kin'', ''-kAAn'' (''-kaan ~ -kään''), ''-pA'' (''-pa'' ~ ''-pä''), ''-hAn'' (''-han ~ -hän'') and ''-s''. One word can have multiple clitics attached to it: ''on'''kohan'''?'' "'''I wonder''' '''if''' it is?"
**''-kO'' attached to a verb makes it a question: ''Katsot televisiota'' "You are watching television" → ''Katsot'''ko''' televisiota?'' "Are you watching television?"
**''-kA'' gives the host word a colloquial tone: ''miten'' ~ ''miten'''kä''''' ("how"). When attached to a [[Negative_verb#Finnish|negative verb]] it corresponds with "and": ''En pidä mansikoista en'''kä''' mustikoista'' "I don't like strawberries '''nor''' blueberries". It can also make a negative verb stronger: ''En'''kä''' tule!'' "I '''definitely''' won't come!"
**''-kin'' is a focus particle, often used instead of ''myös'' ("also" / "as well"): ''Minä'''kin''' olin siellä'' "I was there '''too'''". Depending on the context when attached to a verb it can also express that something happened according to the plan or as a surprise and not according to the plan. It can also make exclamations stronger. It can be attached to several words in the same sentence, changing the focus of the host word, but can only appear once per sentence: ''Minä'''kin''' olin siellä'' ("'''I''' was there '''too'''"), ''Minä olin'''kin''' siellä'' ("'''Surprisingly''' I '''was''' there"), ''Minä olin siellä'''kin''''' ("I was '''there''' '''too'''")
**''-kAAn'' is also a focus particle and it corresponds with ''-kin'' in negative sentences: ''Minä'''kään''' en ollut siellä'' "I wasn't there '''either'''". Like ''-kin'' it can be attached to several host words in the same sentence. The only word it cannot be attached to is a negative verb. In questions it acts as a confirmation, like the word ''again'' in English: ''Missä sanoit'''kaan''' asuvasi?'' "Where did you say you lived '''again'''?"
**''-pA'' is a tone particle which can either add an arguing or patronising tone, or strengthen the host word:  ''Minä'''pä''' tiedän paremmin!'' "Well I know better!", ''On'''pa''' kaunis kissa!'' "'''Wow''' what a beautiful cat!"
**''-hAn'' is also a tone particle. In interrogative sentences  it can make the question more polite and not as pressing: ''Onko'''han''' isäsi kotona?'' "('''I wonder''') Is your dad home?" In command phrases it makes the command softer: ''Tule'''han''' tänne'' "Come here '''you'''". It can also make a sentence more explanatory, make a claim more self-evident, express that something happened according to one's expectations, or that something came as a surprise etc. ''Pekka tuntee minut, on'''han''' hän minun opettajani'' "Pekka knows me, he is my teacher '''after all'''", ''Kaikki'''han''' niin tekevät'' "Everyone do so '''after all'''", ''Maija'''han''' se siinä!'' "Oh but it is Maija!" ''Luulin, ettette osaisi, mutta te'''hän''' puhutte suomea hyvin'' "I thought you wouldn't be able to, but you speak Finnish well"
** ''-s'' is a tone particle as well. It can also be used as a mitigating or softening phrase like ''-hAn'': ''Anniko'''s''' se on?'' "'''Oh but''' isn't it Anni?", ''Tule'''s''' tänne'' "Come here '''you'''", ''Miksikä'''s''' ei?'' "'''Well''' why not?", ''Paljonko'''s''' kello on?'' "'''I wonder''' what time it is?"
*[[Ganda language|Ganda]]: ''-nga'' attached to a verb to form the [[progressive aspect|progressive]]; ''-wo'' 'in' (also attached to a verb)
*[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: the marker of indirect questions is ''-e:'' ''Nem tudja még, jön'''-e'''.'' "He doesn't know yet '''if''' he'll come." This clitic can also mark direct questions with a falling intonation. ''Is'' ("as well") and ''se'' ("not... either") also function as clitics: although written separately, they are pronounced together with the preceding word, without stress: ''Ő is jön.'' "He'll come too." ''Ő sem jön.'' "He won't come, either."
*[[Japanese language|Japanese]]: all [[Japanese particles|particle]]s, such as the [[genitive case|genitive]] [[postposition]] [[wikt:の#Particle|の]] (''no'') and the [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] marker [[wikt:は#Particle|は]] (''wa'').
*[[Korean language|Korean]]: The copula [[wikt:이다|이다]] (''ida'') and the adjectival [[wikt:하다|하다]] (''hada''), as well as some nominal and verbal particles (e.g. [[wikt:는|는]], ''neun'').&lt;ref&gt;

'''Eastern Morocco Zenati dialects''' are a cluster of [[Berber languages|Berber]] dialects spoken in the [[Jerada Province]], [[Morocco]], to the southwest of [[Oujda]]. They belong to the [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] dialectal group and are closely related to the main [[Riff languages|Riffian]] dialects,&lt;ref&gt;J. Bourrilly, Éléments d'éthnographie marocaine, p.42 (Larose, 1932)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to the [[Beni Snous dialect|Aït Snous dialect]], spoken across the border in [[Algeria]].&lt;ref name="Murdock"&gt;G. P. Murdock, African Cultural Summaries, Volume 10 (Human Relations Area Files, 1958) : "The Zekara (Zkara), with whom are grouped the neighboring Bekhti (Oulad Bekhti), Chebel (Beni Chebel), Yala (Beni Yaala, Beni Yala), and Zeggu (Beni Bou Zeggou) of eastern Morocco and the Snus (Beni Snous) across the border of Algeria, belong to the Zenata division of the Berber branch of the Hamito-Semitic linguistic stock."&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastern Morocco Zenati is spoken among the [[Berbers|Berber]] tribes of [[Beni Bouzegou]], [[Beni Ya'la]], [[Zekara]],  [[Bekhata]], [[Haddiyin]], [[Meharez]] and [[Rwaba']].&lt;ref name="Behn"&gt;P.

Behnstedt (2002) cites Derawesh ; the latter is actually a sub-tribe of Beni Bouzegou&lt;/ref&gt; 

Formerly, these dialects were also spoken in the area between [[Debdou]] and [[Taourirt, Morocco|Taourirt]] (to the west of their current speaking area) by the tribes of [[Beni Koulal]], [[Oulad Mahdi]] and [[Beni Chebel]] ; these tribes are currently mainly Arabophone.&lt;ref name="Murdock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Behn" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

An '''electronic libretto''' system is used primarily in [[List of opera houses|opera houses]] and is a device which presents translations of lyrics into an audience's language or transcribes lyrics that may be difficult to understand in the sung form. 

Since 1983, projected ''[[Supertitle]]s'' or ''surtitles'' have been commonly used in [[opera]] or other theatrical and musical performances and they have proven to be a commercial success in art forms such as opera which are generally performed in their original language.

However, for many people, supertitles interfered with their enjoyment of a performance, because they tended to find themselves following the titles and not giving their full attention to the stage.  This problem was solved by the development of an electronic libretto system, which utilizes individual screens placed on the back of each seat, thus allowing patrons either to view a translation or to switch them off during the performance.

Although initially developed by technicians at The [[Santa Fe Opera]], the [[Metropolitan Opera]] was the first to install the system which they describe as ''Met Titles''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1D91031F93AA35757C0A963958260  Edward Rothstein, ''New York Times'', 9 April 1995 - see below]&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the electronic libretto system was further developed and patented as "Simultext" by Figaro Systems of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] with The Santa Fe Opera becoming the second house to adopt it in 1999 after its 1997/98 refurbishment. 

Opera houses such as the Valencia Opera House, the [[National Noh Theatre]] in [[Tokyo]], the [[Vienna State Opera]] in [[Vienna]], the [[Liceu]] in [[Barcelona]], the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[London]] and the [[Teatro degli Arcimboldi]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/luglio/20/Teatro_degli_Arcimboldi_alta_tecnologia_co_0_010720673.shtml Giuseppina Manin, "Al Teatro degli Arcimboldi alta tecnologia e i «sottotitoli»", ''Corriere della Sera'', 20 July 2001, at archiviostorico.corriere.it (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[La Scala]] (both in [[Milan]]) have added the electronic titles, the latter providing [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] translations in addition to the original language of the opera.

Other companies have developed similar technologies, such as Sonoidea in Spain, Visutech in Denmark, Radio Marconi in Italy, 3Com in US and Rokko Denki in Japan.

In the United States, various of these systems are now to be found at the [[Miami]]'s [[Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts]], [[Ellie Caulkins Opera House]] in [[Denver, Colorado]], at the [[Des Moines Metro Opera]], the [[Seattle Opera]], [[Lyric Opera of Kansas City]], and in the Roy O. Disney Theatre, a part of the [[National Hispanic Cultural Center]] in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].

This technology, which costs about $1,000 per seat, has been added or planned for during initial construction (as was the case with Santa Fe where it was added one year after the opening of the third opera house in 1998) or during planned renovation (as with La Scala during its two-year closure period). The installations of the Met, La Scala and the Arcimboldi, the Vienna State Opera, Liceu, and the Royal Opera House were possible with the donations of the philanthropist [[Alberto Vilar]], at the time a majority shareholder of Figaro Systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1347192.stm "Screens plan for opera fans" 23 May 2001 at bbc.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, a new trend is the Radio Marconi multimedia patented interactive electronic libretto technology, installed in 2011 in the [[Royal Opera House Muscat]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://rohmuscat.org.om/ on rohmuscat.org.om] Retrieved 13 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sultanate of Oman and in 2013 at the [[Musiktheater Linz]], Austria. The event on stage become an interactive and multimedia experience that has the power to capture the audience's attention and involve people in the show. The audience can decide to view videos, texts, theatre information, surveys, or ask for assistance just by touching his/her personal screen. The video area will display the chosen content and, in the text multilanguage area, the related information appears as well as personal messages. This technology is able to shift the problem of the installation cost per seat to the revenue generation per seat thanks to its embedded marketing, donation and merchandising features.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16496">[[File:Free-tier in freemium business pattern.png|thumb|In freemium business model, business tiers start with a "free" tier]]
'''Freemium''' is a [[pricing strategies|pricing strategy]] by which a product or service (typically a digital offering or an application such as software, media, games or web services) is provided [[freeware|free of charge]], but money (premium) is charged for additional features, services, or virtual (online) or physical (offline) goods.&lt;ref&gt;JLM de la Iglesia, JEL Gayo, "''Doing business by selling free services''". Web 2.0: The Business Model, 2008. Springer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hayes, "''Jump Point: How Network Culture is Revolutionizing Business''". 2008. Page 195.&lt;/ref&gt; "Freemium" is a [[portmanteau]] of the words "free" and "premium". The business model has been in use by the software industry since the 1980s as a licensing scheme. A subset of this model used by the video game industry is called [[free-to-play]].

== Origin ==
The business model has been in use for software since the 1980s. This is often in a time-limited or feature-limited version to promote a paid-for full version. The model is particularly suited to software as the cost of distribution is negligible. Thus little is lost by giving away free software licenses as long as significant [[Cannibalization (marketing)|cannibalization]] is avoided. The term ''freemium'' to describe this model appears to have been created only much later, in response to a 2006 blog post by venture capitalist [[Fred Wilson (financier)|Fred Wilson]] summarizing the model:&lt;ref name="avc_fav_bus_model"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/218107 | title=Freemium: Is the Price Right for Your Company? | publisher=Entrepreneur | date=February 7, 2011 | accessdate=2018-01-09|first=Barbara Findlay{{failed verification|date=January 2018}} |last=Schenck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Give your service away for free, possibly ad supported but maybe not, acquire a lot of customers very efficiently through [[word of mouth]], referral networks, [[Organic search|organic search marketing]], etc., then offer premium priced value added services or an enhanced version of your service to your customer base.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Jarid Lukin of [[Alacra]], one of Wilson's portfolio companies, then suggested the term "freemium" for this model. 

In 2009, [[Chris Anderson (The Long Tail)|Chris Anderson]] published the book ''[[Free (book)|Free]]'', which examines the popularity of this business model. As well as for traditional software and services, it is now also often used by [[Web 2.0]] and [[open source]] companies.&lt;ref name="cnn_business_model"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/10/01/8387115/index.htm | title=Why It Pays to Give Away the Store | publisher=Business 2.0 Magazine | work=CNN Money | date=2006-10-01 | accessdate=2012-08-13 | last= Heires |first= Katherine }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Eric Seufert published the book ''Freemium Economics'', which attempts to deconstruct the economic principles of the freemium model and prescribe a framework for implementing them into software products.&lt;ref name="freemium_economics_pocketgamer"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.pocketgamer.biz/feature/57185/i-wrote-freemium-economics-to-encourage-better-f2p-games-not-more-says-eric-seufert/ | title=I wrote Freemium Economics to encourage better F2P games not more, says Eric Seufert | publisher=Steel Media | work=PocketGamer | date=2014-02-07 | accessdate=2014-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The freemium model is closely related to tiered services. It has become a popular model,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} with notable examples including [[LinkedIn]],&lt;ref name="techstarthub_freemium_approach"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.techstarthub.com/2011/09/11/freemium-approach-attracts-venture-capital/ | title=‘Freemium’ approach attracts venture capital | publisher=Postmedia Network Inc. | work=The Montreal Gazette | date=2011-09-11 | accessdate=2013-08-13 | last=Barr |first= Alistair }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Badoo]],&lt;ref name="wsj_social_network"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2012/01/24/the-very-social-network/?mod=google_news_blog | title=A Very Social Network | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=2012-01-24 | accessdate=2012-08-13 | author=Rooney, Ben }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the form of a "soft" [[paywall]], such as those employed by ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="cjr_nytimes_paywall"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/the_nyt_paywall_is_out_of_the.php | title=The NYT Paywall Is Out of the Gate Fast | work=Columbia Journalism Review | date=2011-07-22 | accessdate=2011-12-07 | last=Chittum |first= Ryan }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Press+.&lt;ref name="paidcontent_three_more_paywalls"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://paidcontent.org/article/419-whats-new-in-newspaper-paywalls-google-one-pass-membership-programs/ | title=Three More Papers Put Up Paywalls, With Some New Twists | publisher=Gigaom | work=paidcontent.org | date=2011-09-06 | accessdate=2012-08-13 | last=Owen |first= Laura Hazard }}&lt;/ref&gt; A freemium model is sometimes used to build a consumer base when the marginal cost of producing extra units is low.

In the US, in the Christian [[501(c) organization|501 (c) 3]] [[religious education]] sector, [[Christian Leaders Institute]] (CLI) uses the freemium model to train Christian leaders. CLI offers free training to individuals, who receive "unofficial" certificates, diplomas and degrees at no charge. The infrastructure cost to provide this training and these "unofficial" awards is supported by donations to the mission, which receive [[tax deduction]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in the United States. If CLI students want official awards, they are required to make minimal "non-tax deductible" donations that cover the costs of individual processing, verification, and delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianleadersinstitute.org/online-ministry-training-admission|title=Online Ministry Training Admission - Free Training|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Other examples include [[free-to-play]] games – video games that can be downloaded without paying. Video game publishers of free-to-play games rely on other means to generate revenue – such as optional in-game virtual items that can be purchased by players to enhance game-play or aesthetics.

== Restrictions ==
Ways in which the product or service may be restricted in the free version include:&lt;ref name="techcrunch_startup_school"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/24/startup-school-wired-editor-chris-anderson-on-freemium-business-models/|title=Startup School: Wired Editor Chris Anderson On Freemium Business Models|last=Kincaid|first=Jason|date=2009-10-24|website=[[Techcrunch]]|publisher=AOL, Inc.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Limited features: A free video chat client may not include three-way video calling. Most [[free-to-play]] games fall into this category, as they offer virtual items that are either impossible or very slow to purchase with in-game currency but can be instantly purchased with real-world money.
* Limited capacity: For example, [[SQL Server Express]] is restricted to databases of 10GB or less.
* Limited use license: For example, most Autodesk or Microsoft software products with full features are free for students with an educational license. (See: [[Microsoft Imagine]].) Some apps, like [[CCleaner]], are free for personal use only.
* Limited use time: Most free-to-play games permit the user to play the game consecutively for a limited number of levels or turns; the player must either wait a period time to play more or purchase the right to play more.
* Limited support: Priority or real-time technical support may not be available for non-paying users. For example, [[Comodo Group|Comodo]] offers all its software products free of charge. Its premium offerings only add various kinds of technical support.
* Limited or no access to online services that are only available by purchasing periodic subscriptions

Some software and services make all of the features available for free for a trial period and then at the end of that period revert to operating as a feature-limited free version (e.g. [[Online Armor Personal Firewall]]). The user can unlock the premium features on payment of a license fee, as per the freemium model. Some businesses use a variation of the model known as "[[open core]]", in which the unsupported, feature-limited free version is also [[Open-source software|open-source]] software, but versions with additional features and official support are commercial software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Anthony I.|last1=Wasserman|title=How the Internet transformed the software industry|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13174-011-0019-x|journal=Journal of Internet Services and Applications|issn=1867-4828|pages=11–22|volume=2|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s13174-011-0019-x|accessdate=25 January 2015|quote=Some companies have only a single version of their software, while others follow an “open core” model, providing a community release of the core version, and offering proprietary premium features us- ing a commercial license.|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
In June 2011, [[PC World (magazine)|''PC World'']] reported that traditional [[anti-virus software]] had started to lose market share to freemium anti-virus products.&lt;ref name="pcworld_free_antivirus"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/229610/free_antivirus_programs_rise_in_popularity_new_survey_shows.html | title=Free Antivirus Programs Rise in Popularity, New Survey Shows | publisher=IDG Consumer &amp;amp; SMB | newspaper=PC World | date=2011-06-07 | accessdate=2011-06-12 | author=Dunn, John E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2012, all but two of the 50 highest-grossing apps in the Games section of Apple's [[iTunes]] [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] supported [[microtransaction|in-app purchases]], leading ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' to conclude that game developers were now required to choose between including such purchases or foregoing a very substantial revenue stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=iOS Game Developers Must Choose: Sell Digital Currency or Lose Money|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/09/life-after-disc-digital-coins/|accessdate=27 September 2012|newspaper=Wired|date=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2013, the digital distribution platform [[Steam (software)|Steam]] began to add numerous [[Free to play]] and [[Early Access]] games to its library, many of which utilized Freemium marketing for their in-game economies. Due to criticism that the multiplayer games falling under this were "pay to win" in nature or were low-quality and never finished development, [[Valve Corporation]] has since added stricter rules to its Early Access and Free-to-play policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gera|first1=Emily|title=Valve adds new rules to Steam Early Access to ensure games don't suck|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/11/21/7258763/valve-steam-early-access-rules-change|website=www.polygon.com|publisher=Polygon|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of games ==
{{see also|Free-to-play#Criticism}}
Freemium games have come under criticism from players and critics. Many are labelled with the derogatory term '[[Pay2Win]]', a term which criticizes freemium games for giving an advantage to players who pay more money as opposed to those who have more skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmorpg.com/discussion2.cfm/post/5512465#5512465 |title=Most freemium games are pay to win - The Pub at MMORPG.COM - General Discussion Forums at |publisher=Mmorpg.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=March 15, 2013 1:18PM PDT |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/ea-freemium-is-where-things-are-going-6405414 |title=EA: freemium is 'where things are going' - GameSpot.com |publisher=Uk.gamespot.com |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms also extend to the way that the business model can often appear unregulated, to the point of encouraging prolific spending.  

An example of this is ''Smurfs' Village'', which was released by [[Capcom]] as a free game tied in with the release of [[The Smurfs (film)|the 2011 film]]. The game was very popular, at one point overtaking ''[[Angry Birds]]'' as the top-downloaded app on the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple iOS App Store]]. The game had the player buy characters and buildings using in-game currency, but more currency could be purchased with real money using account details tied to the device, using Apple's store authentication prior to purchase. Prior to changes Apple made in 2011, it was possible to use the authentication for up to fifteen minutes before having to reconfirm the password,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Ryan|title=Apple Adds Additional Password Protection for In-App Purchases|url=http://gigaom.com/2011/03/10/apple-now-requires-password-entry-for-every-in-app-purchase/|accessdate=30 January 2013| date = 2011-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and parents had soon found that their children had used this to unwittingly incur hundreds of US dollars in charges by playing the game. A group of parents filed suit against Apple to change their practice in [[microtransactions]] to prevent this from happening in other freemium games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/04/parents-sue-apple-for-in-app-and-in-game-purchases-made-by-kids/ | title = Parents Sue Apple for In-App and In-Game Purchases Made by Kids | first = Joanna | last = Stern | date = 2012-04-20 | accessdate = 2012-12-06 | publisher = [[ABC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, 2014, the sixth episode of Season 18 of the animated TV series ''[[South Park]]'' aired an episode entitled "[[Freemium Isn't Free|Freemium Isn’t Free]]." The episode satirized the business model for encouraging predatory game design tactics based on an improper business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2014/11/06/south-park-is-right-about-why-the-simpsons-and-family-guy-free-to-play-games-stink/ | title = ‘South Park’ is right about why ‘The Simpsons’ and ‘Family Guy’ free-to-play games stink | first = Jeffrey | last = Grubb | date = 2014-11-06 | accessdate = 2014-11-08 | publisher = [[Venture Beat]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Nintendo]] released two of their own freemium games in the ''[[Pokémon]]'' series based on other standalone purchasable titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ca.ign.com/articles/2015/02/18/pokemon-shuffle-is-available-now-in-europe-free-for-3ds | title = Pokemon Shuffle Is Available Now, Free For 3DS | first = Chloi | last = Rad | date = 2015-02-18 | accessdate = 2015-04-22 | publisher = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nintendo"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.youthhealthmag.com/articles/13900/20150414/pok%C3%A9mon-rumble-world-recently-released-for-3ds-nintendo-s-newest-freemium-game-doesn-t-steal-your-money-as-much-as-pok%C3%A9mon-shuffle.htm | title = ‘Pokémon Rumble World’ Recently Released For 3DS; Nintendo’s Newest Freemium Game Doesn’t Steal Your Money As Much As ‘Pokémon Shuffle?’ | first = Marijim | last = Dy | date = 2015-04-14 | accessdate = 2015-04-22 | publisher = Youth Health Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nintendo has taken a different approach with freemium games by making it possible to complete the entire game without buying premium credits, having that as an option so players can proceed through the game at a pace that suits them.&lt;ref name="Nintendo"/&gt;

There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by ''[[Ethnologue]]'', with over two thirds (313) of them belonging to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian branch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=2-16|title=Ethnologue report for Indo-European|publisher=Ethnologue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu)]], [[English language|English]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], each with over 100 million speakers, with [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Persian language|Persian]] also having more than 50 million. Today, nearly 42% of the human population (3.2 billion) speaks an Indo-European language as a first language, by far the highest of any language family.

The Indo-European family includes most of the modern [[languages of Europe]]; notable exceptions include [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], and [[Sami languages|Sami]]. The Indo-European family is also represented in [[Asia]] with the exception of [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. It was predominant in ancient [[Anatolia]] (present-day [[Turkey]]), the ancient [[Tarim Basin]] (present-day [[Northwest China]]) and most of [[Central Asia]] until the medieval [[Turkic migration|Turkic]] and [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasions]]. Outside Eurasia, Indo-European languages are dominant in the [[Americas]] and much of [[Oceania]] and [[Africa]], having reached there during the [[Age of Discovery]]. 

With written evidence appearing since the [[Bronze Age]] in the form of the [[Anatolian languages]] and [[Mycenaean Greek]], the Indo-European family is significant to the field of [[historical linguistics]] as possessing the second-longest [[recorded history]], after the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic family]], although certain [[language isolate]]s, such as [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], [[Hattian language|Hattian]], and [[Kassite language|Kassite]] are recorded earlier.

All Indo-European languages are descendants of a single prehistoric language, [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], spoken sometime in the [[Neolithic]] era. Although no written records remain, aspects of the [[Proto-Indo-European society|culture]] and [[Proto-Indo-European religion|religion]] of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] can also be reconstructed from the related cultures of ancient and modern Indo-European speakers who continue to live in areas to where the Proto-Indo-Europeans [[Indo-European migrations|migrated]] from their [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|original homeland]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Several [[#Suggested macrofamilies|disputed proposals]] link Indo-European to other major language families. Although they are written in [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Old Assyrian]], the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] loanwords and names found in the [[Kültepe]] texts are the oldest record of any Indo-European language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryce |first=Trevor |date= 2005|title=Kingdom of the Hittites: New Edition |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=37 |isbn=0199281327 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the nineteenth century, the linguistic concept of Indo-European languages was frequently used interchangeably with the racial concepts of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] and [[Japhetite]].&lt;ref name="Kidd2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Kidd|title=The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600–2000|url={{Google books|aNT3q1HjY_MC|page=PA23|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|date=7 September 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45753-8|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Indo-European linguistics==
{{See also|Indo-European studies#History}}
In the 16th century, European visitors to the [[Indian subcontinent]] began to notice similarities among [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Iranian languages|Iranian]], and [[languages of Europe|European]] languages. In 1583, English [[Jesuit]] missionary and [[Konkani]] scholar [[Thomas Stephens (Jesuit)|Thomas Stephens]] wrote a letter from [[Goa]] to his brother (not published until the 20th century)&lt;ref name="auroux"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sylvain|last=Auroux|title=History of the Language Sciences|page=1156|isbn=3-11-016735-2|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin, New York|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yasNy365EywC&amp;pg=PA1156&amp;vq=stephens+sassetti&amp;dq=3110167352}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he noted similarities between Indian languages &lt;!--NOT SANSKRIT: see REF --&gt;and [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]].

Another account was made by [[Filippo Sassetti]], a merchant born in [[Florence]] in 1540, who travelled to the Indian subcontinent. Writing in 1585, he noted some word similarities between Sanskrit and Italian (these included ''devaḥ''/''dio'' "God", ''sarpaḥ''/''serpe'' "serpent", ''sapta''/''sette'' "seven", ''aṣṭa''/''otto'' "eight", and ''nava''/''nove'' "nine").&lt;ref name="auroux"/&gt; However, neither Stephens' nor Sassetti's observations led to further scholarly inquiry.&lt;ref name="auroux"/&gt;

In 1647, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] linguist and scholar [[Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn]] noted the similarity among certain Asian and European languages and theorized that they were derived from a primitive common language which he called ''[[Scythian]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} He included in his hypothesis [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[German language|German]], later adding [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], and [[Baltic languages]]. However, Van Boxhorn's suggestions did not become widely known and did not stimulate further research.
[[File:Franz Bopp (2).jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|Franz Bopp, pioneer in the field of comparative linguistic studies.]]
Ottoman Turkish traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] visited Vienna in 1665–1666 as part of a diplomatic mission and noted a few similarities between words in German and in Persian.
[[Gaston-Laurent Coeurdoux|Gaston Coeurdoux]] and others made observations of the same type. Coeurdoux made a thorough comparison of Sanskrit, Latin and Greek [[grammatical conjugation|conjugations]] in the late 1760s to suggest a relationship among them. Meanwhile, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] compared different language groups, including Slavic, Baltic ("[[Courland|Kurlandic]]"), Iranian ("[[Median language|Medic]]"), [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], "Hottentot" ([[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]]), and others, noting that related languages (including Latin, Greek, German and Russian) must have separated in antiquity from common ancestors.&lt;ref name=Lomonosov&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/lomonos/texts/lo0/lo7/lo7-5952.htm M. V. Lomonosov (drafts for ''Russian Grammar'', published 1755). In: Complete Edition, Moscow, 1952, vol. 7, pp. 652–659]:

The hypothesis reappeared in 1786 when [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] first lectured on the striking similarities among three of the oldest languages known in his time: [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Sanskrit]], to which he tentatively added [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], and [[Persian language|Persian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.billposer.org/Papers/iephm.pdf |title= Indo-European Practice and Historical Methodology (cited on pp. 14–15). |format= PDF |date= |accessdate= 2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; though his classification contained some inaccuracies and omissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Archaeology%20data/CH4-BLENCH.pdf |title=Archaeology and Language: methods and issues |author=Roger Blench |accessdate=May 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517091902/http://www.rogerblench.info/Archaeology%20data/CH4-BLENCH.pdf |archivedate=May 17, 2006 |dead-url=yes |df= }} In: A Companion To Archaeology.

  |text=The Sanscrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists.{{notetag|The sentence goes on to say, equally correctly as it turned out: "...here is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the Gothic and the Celtic, though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanscrit; and the old Persian might be added to the same family."}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] first used the term ''Indo-European'' in 1813, deriving from the geographical extremes of the language family: from [[Western Europe]] to [[North India]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''London Quarterly Review'' X/2 1813.; cf. Szemerényi 1999:12, footnote 6&lt;/ref&gt; A synonym is ''Indo-Germanic'' (''Idg.'' or ''IdG.''), specifying the family's southeasternmost and northwesternmost branches. This first appeared in French (''indo-germanique'') in 1810 in the work of [[Conrad Malte-Brun]]; in most languages this term is now dated or less common than ''Indo-European'', although in German ''indogermanisch'' remains the standard scientific term. A [[Japhetic language|number of other synonymous terms]] have also been used.

[[Franz Bopp]] wrote in 1816 ''On the conjugational system of the Sanskrit language compared with that of Greek, Latin, Persian and Germanic''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Über das Conjugationssystem der Sanskritsprache : in Vergleichung mit jenem der griechischen, lateinischen, persischen und germanischen Sprache|author=Franz Bopp|location=Hildesheim|publisher=Olms|date=2010|edition=2|series=Documenta Semiotica : Serie 1, Linguistik|orig-year=1816}}&lt;/ref&gt; and between 1833 and 1852 he wrote ''Comparative Grammar''. This marks the beginning of [[Indo-European studies]] as an academic discipline. The classical phase of Indo-European [[comparative linguistics]] leads from this work to [[August Schleicher]]'s 1861 ''Compendium'' and up to [[Karl Brugmann]]'s ''[[Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen|Grundriss]]'', published in the 1880s. Brugmann's [[neogrammarian]] reevaluation of the field and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s development of the [[laryngeal theory]] may be considered the beginning of "modern" Indo-European studies. The generation of Indo-Europeanists active in the last third of the 20th century (such as [[Calvert Watkins]], [[Jochem Schindler]], and [[Helmut Rix]]) developed a better understanding of morphology and of [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] in the wake of [[Jerzy Kuryłowicz|Kuryłowicz]]'s 1956 ''Apophony in Indo-European,'' who in 1927 pointed out the existence of the Hittite consonant ḫ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=ə indo-européen et ḫ hittite|editor1-last=Taszycki|editor1-first=W.|editor2-last=Doroszewski|editor2-first=W.|title=Symbolae grammaticae in honorem Ioannis Rozwadowski |last=Kurylowicz|first=Jerzy|year=1927|volume=1|pages=95–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuryłowicz's discovery supported Ferdinand de Saussure's 1879 proposal of the existence of ''coefficients sonantiques'', elements de Saussure reconstructed to account for vowel length alternations in Indo-European languages. This led to the so-called [[laryngeal theory]], a major step forward in Indo-European linguistics and a confirmation of de Saussure's theory.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Grouping===
{{Further|Language families}}
[[File:IndoEuropeanTree.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Indo-European family tree in order of first attestation]]

Membership of languages in the Indo-European language family is determined by [[Genetic (linguistics)|genealogical]] relationships, meaning that all members are presumed descendants of a common ancestor, [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. Membership in the various branches, groups and subgroups of Indo-European is also genealogical, but here the defining factors are ''shared innovations'' among various languages, suggesting a common ancestor that split off from other Indo-European groups. For example, what makes the Germanic languages a branch of Indo-European is that much of their structure and phonology can be stated in rules that apply to all of them. Many of their common features are presumed innovations that took place in [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], the source of all the Germanic languages.

===Tree versus wave model===
{{See also|Language change}}
The "[[tree model]]" is considered an appropriate representation of the genealogical history of a language family if communities do not remain in contact after their languages have started to diverge. In this case, subgroups defined by shared innovations form a nested pattern. The tree model is not appropriate in cases where languages remain in contact as they diversify; in such cases subgroups may overlap, and the "[[Wave model (linguistics)|wave model]]" is a more accurate representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In addition to genealogical changes, many of the early changes in Indo-European languages can be attributed to [[language contact]]. It has been asserted, for example, that many of the more striking features shared by Italic languages (Latin, Oscan, Umbrian, etc.) might well be [[Areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]]. More certainly, very similar-looking alterations in the systems of [[long vowel]]s in the West Germanic languages greatly postdate any possible notion of a [[proto-language]] innovation (and cannot readily be regarded as "areal", either, because English and continental West Germanic were not a linguistic area). In a similar vein, there are many similar innovations in Germanic and Balto-Slavic that are far more likely areal features than traceable to a common proto-language, such as the uniform development of a [[high vowel]] (*''u'' in the case of Germanic, *''i/u'' in the case of Baltic and Slavic) before the PIE syllabic resonants *''ṛ,* ḷ, *ṃ, *ṇ'', unique to these two groups among IE languages, which is in agreement with the wave model. The [[Balkan sprachbund]] even features areal convergence among members of very different branches.

Using an extension to the ''[[Donald Ringe|Ringe]]-[[Tandy Warnow|Warnow]] model of language evolution'', early IE was confirmed to have featured limited contact between distinct lineages, whereas only the Germanic subfamily exhibited a less treelike behaviour as it acquired some characteristics from neighbours early in its evolution rather than from its direct ancestors. The internal diversification of especially West Germanic is cited to have been radically non-treelike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://www.cs.rice.edu/~nakhleh/Papers/NRWlanguage.pdf |title= Perfect Phylogenetic Networks: A New Methodology for Reconstructing the Evolutionary History of Natural Languages |first= Luay |last= Nakhleh |first2= Don |last2= Ringe |lastauthoramp= yes |first3= Tandy |last3= Warnow|author3-link= Tandy Warnow |year= 2005 |journal= Language |volume= 81 |issue= 2 |pages= 382–420 |doi= 10.1353/lan.2005.0078 |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

{{Hypothetical Indo-European subfamilies}}
Specialists have postulated the existence of higher-order subgroups such as [[Italo-Celtic]], [[Graeco-Armenian]], [[Graeco-Aryan]] or Graeco-Armeno-Aryan, and Balto-Slavo-Germanic. However, unlike the ten traditional branches, these are all controversial to a greater or lesser degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture | publisher= Fitzroy Dearborn | author1= Mallory, J.P.|author2= Adams, D.Q. | year= 1997 | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italo-Celtic subgroup was at one point uncontroversial, considered by [[Antoine Meillet]] to be even better established than Balto-Slavic.{{sfn|Porzig|1954|p=39}} The main lines of evidence included the genitive suffix ''-ī''; the superlative suffix ''-m̥mo''; the change of /p/ to /kʷ/ before another /kʷ/ in the same word (as in ''penkʷe'' &gt; ''*kʷenkʷe'' &gt; Latin ''quīnque'', Old Irish ''cóic''); and  the subjunctive morpheme ''-ā-''.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=247}} This evidence was prominently challenged by [[Calvert Watkins]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title= Italo-Celtic revisited | encyclopedia= Ancient Indo-European dialects | publisher= University of California Press | author= Watkins, Calvert |editor1= Birnbaum, Henrik |editor2= Puhvel, Jaan | year= 1966 | location= Berkeley | pages= 29–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Michael Weiss has argued for the subgroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title= Italo-Celtica: linguistic and cultural points of contact between Italic and Celtic | conference = Proceedings of the 23rd annual UCLA Indo-European Conference | publisher= Hempen | author= Weiss, Michael |editor-last1= Jamison |editor-first1= Stephanie W. |editor-last2= Melchert |editor-first2= H.

Evidence for a relationship between Greek and Armenian includes the regular change of the [[Laryngeal theory|second laryngeal]] to ''a'' at the beginnings of words, as well as terms for "woman" and "sheep".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Review of ''The linguistic relationship between Armenian and Greek'' by James Clackson | author= Greppin, James | journal= Language | year= 1996 | volume= 72 | issue= 4 | pages= 804–807 | doi= 10.2307/416105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek and Indo-Iranian share innovations mainly in verbal morphology and patterns of nominal derivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Indoiranisch-griechische Gemeinsamkeiten der Nominalbildung und deren indogermanische Grundlagen | publisher= Institut für Sprachwissenschaft der Universität Innsbruck | author= Euler, Wolfram | year= 1979 | location= Innsbruck}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations have also been proposed between Phrygian and Greek,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lubotsky |first=A. |title=The Old Phrygian Areyastis-inscription |journal=Kadmos |volume=27 |issue= |pages=9–26 |year=1988 |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/2660/299_011.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and between Thracian and Armenian.&lt;ref&gt;Kortlandt – The Thraco-Armenian consonant shift, Linguistique Balkanique 31, 71–74, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Colin Renfrew|last= Renfrew|first= Colin|year= 1987|title= Archaeology &amp; Language.

The [[Indo-Hittite]] hypothesis proposes that the Indo-European language family consists of two main branches: one represented by the Anatolian languages and another branch encompassing all other Indo-European languages. Features that separate Anatolian from all other branches of Indo-European (such as the gender or the verb system) have been interpreted alternately as archaic debris or as innovations due to prolonged isolation. Points proffered in favour of the Indo-Hittite hypothesis are the (non-universal) Indo-European agricultural terminology in Anatolia&lt;ref&gt;The supposed autochthony of Hittites, the Indo-Hittite hypothesis and migration of agricultural "Indo-European" societies became intrinsically linked together by C. Renfrew. (Renfrew, C 2001a The Anatolian origins of Proto-Indo-European and the autochthony of the Hittites. In [[Robert Drews|R. Drews]] ed., Greater Anatolia and the Indo-Hittite language. family: 36–63. Washington, DC: Institute for the Study of Man).&lt;/ref&gt; and the preservation of laryngeals.&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica'' 15th edition, 22 p. 586 "Indo-European languages, The parent language, Laryngeal theory" – W.C.; p. 589, 593 "Anatolian languages" – Philo H.J. Houwink ten Cate, H. Craig Melchert and Theo P.J. van den Hout&lt;/ref&gt; However, in general this hypothesis is considered to attribute too much weight to the Anatolian evidence. According to another view, the Anatolian subgroup left the Indo-European parent language comparatively late, approximately at the same time as Indo-Iranian and later than the Greek or Armenian divisions. A third view, especially prevalent in the so-called French school of Indo-European studies, holds that extant similarities in non-[[satem]] languages in general—including Anatolian—might be due to their peripheral location in the Indo-European language-area and to early separation, rather than indicating a special ancestral relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica'' 15th edition, 22 p. 594, "Indo-Hittite hypothesis"&lt;/ref&gt; Hans J. Holm, based on lexical calculations, arrives at a picture roughly replicating the general scholarly opinion and refuting the Indo-Hittite hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= http://www.hjholm.de/|last= Holm|first= Hans J.|chapter= The Distribution of Data in Word Lists and its Impact on the Subgrouping of Languages|editor1-first= Christine|editor1-last= Preisach|editor2-first= Hans |editor2-last= Burkhardt|editor3-first= Lars|editor3-last= Schmidt-Thieme|editor4-first= Reinhold|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last= Decker|title= Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Applications.

{{Main|Centum and satem languages}}
The division of the Indo-European languages into satem and centum groups was put forward by Peter von Bradke in 1890, although [[Karl Brugmann]] had proposed a similar type of division in 1886. In the satem languages, which include the Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian branches, as well as (in most respects) Albanian and Armenian, the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European phonology#Consonants|Proto-Indo-European palatovelars]] remained distinct and were fricativized, while the labiovelars merged with the "plain velars". In the centum languages, the palatovelars merged with the plain velars, while the labiovelars remained distinct. The results of these alternative developments are exemplified by the words for "hundred" in Avestan (''satem'') and Latin (''centum'')—the initial palatovelar developed into a fricative [s] in the former, but became an ordinary velar [k] in the latter.

Rather than being a genealogical separation, the centum–satem division is commonly seen as resulting from innovative changes that spread across PIE dialect-branches over a particular geographical area; the centum–satem [[isogloss]] intersects a number of other isoglosses that mark distinctions between features in the early IE branches. It may be that the centum branches in fact reflect the original state of affairs in PIE, and only the satem branches shared a set of innovations, which affected all but the peripheral areas of the PIE dialect continuum.&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica'' 15th edition, vol.22, 1981, pp. 588, 594&lt;/ref&gt; Kortlandt proposes that the ancestors of Balts and Slavs took part in satemization before being drawn later into the western Indo-European sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf |first= Frederik |last= Kortlandt |title= The spread of the Indo-Europeans |year= 1989 |format= PDF |date= |accessdate= 2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggested macrofamilies===
{{See also|Origin of language}}

Some linguists propose that Indo-European languages form part of one of several hypothetical [[macrofamily|macrofamilies]]. However, these theories remain highly controversial, not being accepted by most linguists in the field. Some of the smaller proposed macrofamilies include:

* [[Pontic languages|Pontic]], postulated by [[John Colarusso]], which joins Indo-European with [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]]
* [[Indo-Uralic languages|Indo-Uralic]], joining Indo-European with [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]

Other, greater proposed families including Indo-European languages, include:

* [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], a theory championed by [[Joseph Greenberg]]
* [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]], comprising all or some of the Eurasiatic languages, as well as the [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]], [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (or even the [[Elamo-Dravidian languages|Elamo-Dravidian]] macrofamily), [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], and [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language families

Objections to such groupings are not based on any theoretical claim about the likely historical existence or non-existence of such macrofamilies; it is entirely reasonable to suppose that they might have existed. The serious difficulty lies in identifying the details of actual relationships between language families, because it is very hard to find concrete evidence that transcends chance resemblance, or is not equally likely explained as being due to [[loanword|borrowing]] (including [[Wanderwort|Wanderwörter]], which can travel very long distances). Because the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] in historical linguistics declines steadily over time, at great enough time-depths it becomes open to reasonable doubt that one can even distinguish between signal and noise.

==Evolution==

===Proto-Indo-European===
{{Main|Proto-Indo-European language}}
[[File:IE expansion.png|upright=0.9|thumb|Scheme of Indo-European migrations from ca. 4000 to 1000 BC according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]].]]
The proposed Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) is the hypothetical common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, spoken by the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian became certain enough to establish its relationship to PIE. Using the method of [[internal reconstruction]] an earlier stage, called [[Pre-Proto-Indo-European]], has been proposed.

PIE was an [[inflected language]], in which the grammatical relationships between words were signaled through inflectional morphemes (usually endings). The [[root (linguistics)|roots]] of PIE are basic [[morpheme]]s carrying a [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] meaning. By addition of [[suffix]]es, they form [[stem (linguistics)|stems]], and by addition of [[Ending (linguistics)|endings]], these form grammatically inflected words ([[Indo-European noun|nouns]] or [[Indo-European verb|verbs]]). The hypothetical [[Indo-European verb]] system is complex and, like the noun, exhibits a system of [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]].

The diversification of the parent language into the attested branches of daughter languages is historically unattested. The timeline of the evolution of the various daughter languages, on the other hand, is mostly undisputed, quite regardless of the question of [[Indo-European origins]].

Using a mathematical analysis borrowed from evolutionary biology, Don Ringe and Tandy Warnow propose the following evolutionary tree of Indo-European branches:{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=56–58}}
* Pre-[[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] (before 3500 BC)
* Pre-[[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]]
* Pre-Italic and Pre-Celtic (before 2500 BC)
* Pre-Armenian and Pre-Greek (after 2500 BC)
* Proto-[[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] (2000 BC)
* Pre-Germanic and Pre-Balto-Slavic;{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=56–58}} proto-Germanic c. 500 BC{{sfn|Ringe|2006|p=67}}

David Anthony proposes the following sequence:{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=100}}
* Pre-[[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] (4200 BC)
* Pre-[[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] (3700 BC)
* [[Germanic parent language|Pre-Germanic]] (3300 BC)
* Pre-Italic and Pre-Celtic (3000 BC)
* Pre-Armenian (2800 BC)
* Pre-Balto-Slavic (2800 BC)
* Pre-Greek (2500 BC)
* Proto-[[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] (2200 BC); split between Iranian and Old Indic 1800 BC

From 1500 BC the following sequence may be given:
* 1500 BC–1000 BC: The [[Nordic Bronze Age]] develops [[pre-Proto-Germanic]], and the (pre)-[[Proto-Celtic]] [[Urnfield]] and [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] cultures emerge in Central Europe, introducing the [[Iron Age]]. Migration of the Proto-[[Italic languages|Italic]] speakers into the Italian peninsula ([[Bagnolo stele]]). Redaction of the [[Rigveda]] and rise of the [[Vedic civilization]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The [[Mycenaean civilization]] gives way to the [[Greek Dark Ages]]. Hittite goes extinct.
* 1000 BC–500 BC: The [[Celtic languages]] spread over Central and Western Europe. [[Baltic languages]] are spoken in a huge area from present-day Poland to the Ural Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/iedocctr/ie-lg/Balto-Slavic.html |title=Indo-European Languages: Balto-Slavic Family |publisher=Utexas.edu |date=2008-11-10 |accessdate=2010-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604200234/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/iedocctr/ie-lg/Balto-Slavic.html |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proto Germanic]].

* 1 BC/ AD 500: [[Late Antiquity]], [[Gupta period]]; attestation of [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. [[Proto-Slavic]]. The [[Roman Empire]] and then the [[Migration period]] marginalize the Celtic languages to the British Isles. [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], an [[Eastern Iranian language]], becomes the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the [[Silk Road]] in Central Asia leading to China, due to the proliferation of [[Sogdia]]n merchants there. The last of the Anatolian languages are [[language death|extinct]].
* 500–1000: [[Early Middle Ages]]. The [[Viking Age]] forms an [[Old Norse]] [[Koiné language|koine]] spanning Scandinavia, the British Isles and Iceland. The [[Islamic conquest]] and the [[Turkic expansion]] results in the [[Arabization]] and [[Turkification]] of significant areas where Indo-European languages were spoken. [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] is extinct in the course of the Turkic expansion while [[Northeastern Iranian languages|Northeastern Iranian]] ([[Scytho-Sarmatian]]) is reduced to small refugia. Slavic languages spread over wide areas in central, eastern and southeastern Europe, largely replacing Romance in the Balkans (with the exception of Romanian) and whatever was left of the [[paleo-Balkan languages]] with the exception of Albanian.
* 1000–1500: [[Late Middle Ages]]: Attestation of [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Baltic languages|Baltic]].
* 1500–2000: [[Early modern Europe|Early Modern period]] to present: [[Colonialism]] results in the spread of Indo-European languages to every continent, most notably [[Romance language|Romance]] (North, Central and South America, North and Sub-Saharan Africa, West Asia), [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] ([[English language|English]] in North America, Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and Australia; to a lesser extent Dutch and German), and [[Russian language|Russian]] to Central Asia and North Asia.

===Important languages for reconstruction===
In reconstructing the history of the Indo-European languages and the form of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]], some languages have been of particular importance. These generally include the ancient Indo-European languages that are both well-attested and documented at an early date, although some languages from later periods are important if they are particularly [[conservative (language)|linguistically conservative]] (most notably, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]). Early poetry is of special significance because of the rigid [[poetic meter]] normally employed, which makes it possible to reconstruct a number of features (e.g. [[vowel length]]) that were either unwritten or corrupted in the process of transmission down to the earliest extant written [[manuscript]]s.

Most noticeable {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} of all:
* [[Vedic Sanskrit]] (c. 1500 – 500 BC). This language is unique in that its source documents were all composed orally, and were passed down through [[oral tradition]] ([[shakha]] schools) for c. 2,000 years before ever being written down. The oldest documents are all in poetic form; oldest and most important of all is the [[Rigveda]] (c. 1500 BC).
* [[Mycenaean Greek]] (c. 1450 BC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/03/110330-oldest-writing-europe-tablet-greece-science-mycenae-greek|title=Ancient Tablet Found: Oldest Readable Writing in Europe|date=1 April 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ancient Greek]] (c. 750 – 400 BC). Mycenaean Greek is the oldest recorded form, but its value is lessened by the limited material, restricted subject matter, and highly ambiguous writing system. More important is Ancient Greek, documented extensively beginning with the two [[Homeric poems]] (the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', c. 750 BC).
* [[Hittite language|Hittite]] (c. 1700 – 1200 BC). This is the earliest-recorded of all Indo-European languages, and highly divergent from the others due to the early separation of the [[Anatolian languages]] from the remainder. It possesses some highly archaic features found only fragmentarily, if at all, in other languages. At the same time, however, it appears to have undergone a large number of early phonological and grammatical changes which, combined with the ambiguities of its writing system, hinder its usefulness somewhat.

Other primary sources:
* [[Latin]], attested in a huge amount of poetic and prose material in the [[Classical Latin|Classical]] period (c. 200 BC – 100 AD) and limited [[Old Latin|older material]] from as early as c. 600 BC.
* [[Gothic language|Gothic]] (the most archaic well-documented [[Germanic language]], c. 350 AD), along with the combined witness of the other old Germanic languages: most importantly, [[Old English]] (c. 800 – 1000 AD), [[Old High German]] (c. 750 – 1000 AD) and [[Old Norse]] (c. 1100 – 1300 AD, with limited earlier sources dating all the way back to c. 200 AD).
* [[Old Avestan]] (c. 1700 – 1200 BC) and [[Avestan language|Younger Avestan]] (c. 900 BC). Documentation is sparse, but nonetheless quite important due to its highly archaic nature.
* Modern [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], with limited records in [[Old Lithuanian]] (c. 1500 – 1700 AD).
* [[Old Church Slavonic]] (c. 900 – 1000 AD).

Other secondary sources, of lesser value due to poor attestation:
* [[Luwian language|Luwian]], [[Lycian language|Lycian]], [[Lydian language|Lydian]] and other [[Anatolian languages]] (c. 1400 – 400 BC).
* [[Oscan]], [[Umbrian]] and other [[Italic languages|Old Italic]] languages (c. 600 – 200 BC).
* [[Old Persian]] (c. 500 BC).
* [[Old Prussian]] (c. 1350 – 1600 AD); even more archaic than Lithuanian.

Other secondary sources, of lesser value{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} due to extensive phonological changes and relatively limited attestation:
* [[Old Irish]] (c. 700 – 850 AD).
* [[Tocharian language|Tocharian]] (c. 500 – 800 AD), underwent large phonetic shifts and mergers in the proto-language, and has an almost entirely reworked declension system.
* [[Classical Armenian]] (c. 400 – 1100 AD).
* [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (c. 1450 – current time).

===Sound changes===
{{Main|Indo-European sound laws}}
As the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language broke up, its sound system diverged as well, changing according to various [[sound law]]s evidenced in the [[daughter language]]s.

PIE is normally reconstructed with a complex system of 15 [[stop consonant]]s, including an unusual three-way [[phonation]] ([[voice (phonetics)|voicing]]) distinction between [[voicelessness|voiceless]], [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and "[[voiced aspirated]]" (i.e. [[breathy voiced]]) stops, and a three-way distinction among [[velar consonant]]s (''k''-type sounds) between "palatal" ''ḱ ǵ ǵh'', "plain velar" ''k g gh'' and [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]] ''kʷ gʷ gʷh''. (The correctness of the terms ''palatal'' and ''plain velar'' is disputed; see [[Proto-Indo-European phonology]].)  All daughter languages have reduced the number of distinctions among these sounds, often in divergent ways.

As an example, in [[English language|English]], one of the [[Germanic language]]s, the following are some of the major changes that happened:
{{ordered list
|1= As in other [[centum]] languages, the "plain velar" and "palatal" stops merged, reducing the number of stops from 15 to 12.
|2= As in the other Germanic languages, the [[Germanic sound shift]] changed the realization of all stop consonants, with each consonant shifting to a different one:
: {{PIE|bʰ}} → {{PIE|b}} → {{PIE|p}} → {{PIE|f}}
: {{PIE|dʰ}} → {{PIE|d}} → {{PIE|t}} → {{PIE|θ}}
: {{PIE|gʰ}} → {{PIE|g}} → {{PIE|k}} → {{PIE|x}} (Later initial {{PIE|x}} →{{PIE|h}})
: {{PIE|gʷʰ}} → {{PIE|gʷ}} → {{PIE|kʷ}} → {{PIE|xʷ}} (Later initial {{PIE|xʷ}} →{{PIE|hʷ}})
Each original consonant shifted one position to the right.  For example, original {{PIE|dʰ}} became {{PIE|d}}, while original {{PIE|d}} became {{PIE|t}} and original {{PIE|t}} became {{PIE|θ}} (written ''th'' in English).  This is the original source of the English sounds written ''f'', ''th'', ''h'' and ''wh''.  Examples, comparing English with Latin, where the sounds largely remain unshifted:
:For PIE ''p'': ''piscis'' vs. ''fish''; ''pēs, pēdis'' vs. ''foot''; ''pluvium'' "rain" vs. ''flow''; ''pater'' vs. ''father''
:For PIE ''t'': ''trēs'' vs. ''three''; ''māter'' vs. ''mother''
:For PIE ''d'': ''decem'' vs. ''ten''; ''pēdis'' vs. ''foot''; ''quid'' vs. ''what''
:For PIE ''k'': ''centum'' vs. ''hund(red)''; ''capere'' "to take" vs. ''have''
:For PIE ''kʷ'': ''quid'' vs. ''what''; ''quandō'' vs. ''when''
|3= Various further changes affected consonants in the middle or end of a word:
* The voiced stops resulting from the sound shift were softened to voiced [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] (or perhaps the sound shift directly generated fricatives in these positions).
* [[Verner's law]] also turned some of the voiceless fricatives resulting from the sound shift into voiced fricatives or stops.  This is why the ''t'' in Latin ''centum'' ends up as ''d'' in ''hund(red)'' rather than the expected ''th''.
* Most remaining ''h'' sounds disappeared, while remaining ''f'' and ''th'' became voiced.  For example, Latin ''decem'' ends up as ''ten'' with no ''h'' in the middle (but note ''taíhun'' "ten" in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], an archaic Germanic language).  Similarly, the words ''seven'' and ''have'' have a voiced ''v'' (compare Latin ''septem'', ''capere''), while ''father'' and ''mother'' have a voiced ''th'', although not spelled differently (compare Latin ''pater'', ''māter'').
}}

None of the daughter-language families (except possibly [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], particularly [[Luvian language|Luvian]]) reflect the plain velar stops differently from the other two series, and there is even a certain amount of dispute whether this series existed at all in PIE.  The major distinction between [[Centum-satem isogloss|''centum'' and ''satem'']] languages corresponds to the outcome of the PIE plain velars:
* The "central" ''satem'' languages ([[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) reflect both "plain velar" and labiovelar stops as plain velars, often with secondary [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] before a [[front vowel]] (''e i ē ī'').  The "palatal" stops are palatalized and often appear as [[sibilant]]s (usually but not always distinct from the secondarily palatalized stops).
* The "peripheral" ''centum'' languages ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] and [[Tocharian language|Tocharian]]) reflect both "palatal" and "plain velar" stops as plain velars, while the labiovelars continue unchanged, often with later reduction into plain [[labial consonant|labial]] or [[velar consonant]]s.

The three-way PIE distinction between voiceless, voiced and voiced aspirated stops is considered extremely unusual from the perspective of [[linguistic typology]]—particularly in the existence of voiced aspirated stops without a corresponding series of voiceless aspirated stops. None of the various daughter-language families continue it unchanged, with numerous "solutions" to the apparently unstable PIE situation:
* The [[Indo-Aryan language]]s preserve the three series unchanged but have evolved a fourth series of voiceless aspirated consonants.
* The [[Iranian language]]s probably passed through the same stage, subsequently changing the aspirated stops into fricatives.
* [[Greek language|Greek]] converted the voiced aspirates into voiceless aspirates.
* [[Italic languages|Italic]] probably passed through the same stage, but reflects the voiced aspirates as voiceless fricatives, especially ''f'' (or sometimes plain voiced stops in [[Latin]]).
* [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] merge the voiced aspirated into plain voiced stops.
* [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] change all three series in a [[chain shift]] (e.g. with ''bh b p'' becoming ''b p f'' (known as ''[[Grimm's law]]'' in Germanic).

Among the other notable changes affecting consonants are:
* The [[Ruki sound law]] (''s'' becomes {{IPA|/ʃ/}} before ''r, u, k, i'') in the ''[[satem]]'' languages.
* Loss of prevocalic ''p'' in [[Proto-Celtic]].
* Development of prevocalic ''s'' to ''h'' in [[Proto-Greek]], with later loss of ''h'' between vowels.
* [[Verner's law]] in [[Proto-Germanic]].
* [[Grassmann's law]] (dissimilation of aspirates) independently in Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian.

The following table shows the basic outcomes of PIE consonants in some of the most important daughter languages for the purposes of reconstruction.  For a fuller table, see [[Indo-European sound laws]].

While similarities are still visible between the modern descendants and relatives of these ancient languages, the differences have increased over time. Some IE languages have moved from [[synthetic language|synthetic]] verb systems to largely [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] systems. In addition, the [[pronoun]]s of periphrastic forms are in brackets when they appear. Some of these verbs have undergone a change in meaning as well.
* In Modern Irish ''beir'' usually only carries the meaning ''to bear'' in the sense of bearing a child; its common meanings are ''to catch, grab''.
* The Hindi verb ''bharnā'', the continuation of the Sanskrit verb, can have a variety of meanings, but the most common is "to fill". The forms given in the table, although etymologically derived from the present indicative, now have the meaning of [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]].  The present indicative is conjugated periphrastically, using a participle (etymologically the Sanskrit present participle ''bharant-'') and an auxiliary: ''maiṃ bhartā hūṃ, tū bhartā hai, vah bhartā hai, ham bharte haiṃ, tum bharte ho, ve bharte haiṃ'' (masculine forms).
* German is not directly descended from Gothic, but the Gothic forms are a close approximation of what the early West Germanic forms of c. 400 AD would have looked like.  The cognate of Germanic ''beranan'' (English ''bear'') survives in German only in the compound ''gebären'', meaning "bear (a child)".
* The Latin verb ''ferre'' is irregular, and not a good representative of a normal thematic verb. In most Romance Languages such as French, other verbs now mean "to carry" (e.g. Fr. ''porter'' &lt; Lat. ''portare'') and ''ferre'' was only borrowed and nativized in compounds such as ''souffrir'' "to suffer" (from Latin ''sub-'' and ''ferre'') and {{lang|fr|conférer}} "to confer" (from Latin "con-" and "ferre"). 
* In Modern [[Greek language|Greek]], ''phero'' φέρω (modern transliteration ''fero'') "to bear" is still used but only in specific contexts and is most common in such compounds as αναφέρω, διαφέρω, εισφέρω, εκφέρω, καταφέρω, προφέρω, προαναφέρω, προσφέρω etc. The form that is (very) common today is ''pherno'' φέρνω (modern transliteration ''ferno'') meaning "to bring". Additionally, the perfective form of ''pherno'' (used for the subjunctive voice and also for the future tense) is also ''phero''.
* In Modern [[Russian language|Russian]] ''брать'' (brat') carries the meaning ''to take''. ''Бремя'' (br'em'a) means ''burden'', as something heavy to bear, and derivative ''беременность'' (b'er'em'ennost') means ''pregnancy''.

The success of the language family, including the large number of speakers and the vast portions of the Earth that they inhabit, is due to several factors. The ancient [[Indo-European migrations]] and widespread dissemination of [[Indo-European culture]] throughout [[Eurasia]], including that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] themselves, and that of their daughter cultures including the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Indo-Aryans]], [[Iranian peoples]], [[Celts]], [[Hellenistic period|Greeks]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Germanic peoples]], and [[Slavs]], led to these peoples' branches of the language family already taking a dominant foothold in virtually all of Eurasia except for [[North Asia|North]] and [[East Asia]] by the end of the prehistoric era, replacing the previously-spoken [[pre-Indo-European languages]] of this extensive area.

Despite being unaware of their common linguistic origin, diverse groups of Indo-European speakers continued to culturally dominate and replace the indigenous languages of the western two-thirds of Eurasia. By the beginning of the [[Common Era]], Indo-European peoples controlled almost the entirety of this area: the Celts western and central Europe, the Romans southern Europe, the Germanic peoples northern Europe, the Slavs eastern Europe, the Iranian peoples the entirety of western and central Asia and parts of eastern Europe, and the Indo-Aryan peoples in the [[Indian subcontinent]], with the [[Tocharians]] inhabiting the Indo-European frontier in western China. By the medieval period, only the [[Vasconic]], [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] and [[Uralic languages]] remained of the (relatively) [[Paleo-European languages|indigenous languages of Europe]] and the western half of Asia.

Despite medieval invasions by [[Eurasian nomads]], a group to which the Proto-Indo-Europeans had once belonged, Indo-European expansion reached another peak in the [[early modern period]] with the dramatic increase in the population of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and European expansionism throughout the globe during the [[Age of Discovery]], as well as the continued replacement and assimilation of surrounding non-Indo-European languages and peoples due to increased state centralization and [[nationalism]]. These trends compounded throughout the modern period due to the general global [[population growth]] and the results of [[European colonization]] of the [[Western Hemisphere]] and [[Oceania]], leading to an explosion in the number of Indo-European speakers as well as the territories inhabited by them.

Due to colonization and the modern dominance of Indo-European languages in the fields of global science, technology, education, finance, and sports, even many modern countries whose populations largely speak non-Indo-European languages have Indo-European languages as official languages, and the majority of the global population speaks at least one Indo-European language. The overwhelming majority of [[languages used on the Internet]] are Indo-European, with [[English language|English]] continuing to lead the group; English in general has in many respects [[English as a lingua franca|become the ''lingua franca'']] of global communication.

'''Indonesian Sign Language''', or '''Bahasa Isyarat Indonesia''' (BISINDO), is any of several related [[deaf sign language]]s of [[Indonesia]], at least on the island of [[Java]]. It is based on [[American Sign Language]] (perhaps via [[Malaysian Sign Language]]), with local admixture in different cities.  Although presented as a coherent language when advocating for recognition by the Indonesian government and use in education, the varieties used in different cities may not be mutually intelligible.  

Specifically, the only study to have investigated this, Isma (2012),&lt;ref&gt;Silva Tenrisara Pertiwi Isma, 2012, "Signing Varieties in Jakarta and Yogyakarta"[http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/lin/new/doc/ma_papers/macla/Silva_2011-12.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; found that the sign languages of [[Jakarta]] and [[Yogyakarta]] are related but distinct languages, that they remain 65% lexically cognate but are grammatically distinct and apparently diverging. They are different enough that Isma's consultants in Hong Kong resorted to [[Hong Kong Sign Language]] to communicate with each other. Word order in Yogyakarta tends to be verb-final (SOV), whereas in Jakarta it tends to be verb-medial (SVO) when either noun phrase could be subject or object, and free otherwise.  The varieties in other cities were not investigated. 

Rather than sign language, education currently uses a form of manually-coded Malay known as ''[[Sistem Isyarat Bahasa Indonesia]]'' (SIBI).

'''John Henry McDowell''' (born 7 March 1942) is a [[Union of South Africa|South African]] philosopher, formerly a [[fellow]] of [[University College, Oxford]] and now University Professor at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Although he has written extensively on [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[ancient philosophy]], and [[meta-ethics]], McDowell's most influential work has been in the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[philosophy of language]]. McDowell was one of three recipients of the 2010 Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's Distinguished Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pitt Scholar Honored With Mellon Foundation Distinguished Achievement Award, $1.5 Million Grant for Putting Human Nature Back in Philosophy|url=http://www.news.pitt.edu/news/McDowell-Mellon-achievement-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a Fellow of both the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]] and the [[British Academy]].

McDowell has, throughout his career, understood philosophy to be "therapeutic" and thereby to "leave everything as it is", which he understands to be a form of [[Quietism (philosophy)|philosophical quietism]] (although he does not consider himself to be a "quietist"). The philosophical quietist believes that philosophy cannot make any explanatory comment about how, for example, thought and talk relate to the world but can, by offering re-descriptions of philosophically problematic cases, return the confused philosopher to a state of intellectual quietude. However, in defending this quietistic perspective McDowell has engaged with the work of leading contemporaries in such a way as to therapeutically dissolve what he takes to be philosophical error, while developing original and distinctive theses about language, mind and value.  In each case, he has tried to resist the influence of what he regards as a misguided, reductive form of philosophical naturalism that dominates the work of his contemporaries, particularly in North America.

==Life and career==

McDowell was born in [[Boksburg]], [[South Africa]] and completed a B.A. at the [[University of Zimbabwe|University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]]. In 1963, he moved to [[New College, Oxford|New College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholar]], where he earned another B.A. in 1965 and an M.A. in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophy.pitt.edu/person/john-mcdowell|title=John McDowell  {{!}} Philosophy {{!}} University of Pittsburgh|last=Webteam|first=University of Pittsburgh University Marketing Communications|website=www.philosophy.pitt.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught at [[University College, Oxford]] from 1966 until 1986, when he joined the faculty at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he is now a University Professor. He has also been a visiting professor at many universities, including [[Harvard University]], [[University of Michigan]], and [[University of California, Los Angeles]].

==Philosophical work==

===Early work===

McDowell's earliest published work was in ancient philosophy, most notably including a translation of and commentary on [[Plato]]'s ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.  In the 1970s he was active in the [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidsonian]] project of providing a semantic theory for [[natural language]], co-editing (with [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]]) a volume of essays entitled ''Truth and Meaning''.  McDowell edited and published Evans's influential posthumous book ''The Varieties of Reference'' (1982).

In his early work, McDowell was very much involved both with the development of the Davidsonian semantic programme and with the internecine dispute between those who take the core of a theory that can play the role of a theory of meaning to involve the grasp of truth conditions, and those, such as [[Michael Dummett]], who argued that linguistic understanding must, at its core, involve the grasp of assertion conditions. If, Dummett argued, the core of a theory that is going to do duty for a theory of a meaning is supposed to represent a speaker's understanding, then that understanding must be something of which a speaker can manifest a grasp. McDowell argued, against this Dummettian view and its development by such contemporaries as [[Crispin Wright]], both that this claim did not, as Dummett supposed, represent a Wittgensteinian requirement on a theory of meaning and that it rested on a suspect asymmetry between the evidence for the expressions of mind in the speech of others and the thoughts so expressed. This particular argument reflects McDowell's wider commitment to the idea that, when we understand others, we do so from "inside" our own practices: Wright and Dummett are treated as pushing the claims of explanation too far and as continuing [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s project of understanding linguistic behaviour from an "external" perspective.

In these early exchanges and in the parallel debate over the proper understanding of Wittgenstein's remarks on rule-following, some of McDowell's characteristic intellectual stances were formed: to borrow a Wittgensteinian expression, the defence of a realism without empiricism, an emphasis on the human limits of our aspiration to objectivity, the idea that meaning and mind can be directly manifested in the action, particularly linguistic action, of other people, and a distinctive [[disjunctivism|disjunctive]] theory of perceptual experience.

The latter is an account of perceptual experience, developed at the service of McDowell's realism, in which it is denied that the [[argument from illusion]] supports an indirect or representative theory of perception as that argument presupposes that there is a "highest common factor" shared by veridical and illusory (or, more accurately, delusive) experiences. (There is clearly a distinction between perceiving and acquiring a belief: one can see an "apparently bent" stick in the water but not believe that it is bent as one knows that one's experience is illusory. In illusions, you need not believe that things are as the illusory experiences represent them as being; in delusions, a person believes what their experience represents to them. So the argument from illusion is better described as an argument from delusion if it is to make its central point.)

In the classic argument from illusion (delusion) you are asked to compare a case where you succeed in perceiving, say, a cat on a mat, to the case where a trick of light deceives you and form the belief that the cat is on the mat, when it is not. The proponent of the argument then says that the two states of mind in these contrasting cases share something important in common, and to characterise this we need to introduce an idea like that of "sense data." Acquaintance with such data is the "highest common factor" across the two cases. That seems to force us into a concession that our knowledge of the external world is indirect and mediated via such sense data. McDowell strongly resists this argument: he does not deny that there is something psychologically in common between the subject who really sees the cat and the one that fails to do so. But that psychological commonality has no bearing on the status of the judger's state of mind from the point of view of assessing whether she is in a position to acquire knowledge. In favourable conditions, experience can be such as to make manifest the presence of objects to observers – that is perceptual knowledge. When we succeed in knowing something by perceiving it, experience does not fall short of the fact known. But this just shows that a successful and a failed perceptual thought have nothing interesting in common from the point of view of appraising them as knowledge.

In this claim that a veridical perception and a non-veridical perception share no highest common factor, a theme is visible which runs throughout McDowell's work, namely, a commitment to seeing thoughts as essentially individuable only in their social and physical environment, so called externalism about the mental. McDowell defends, in addition to a general externalism about the mental, a specific thesis about the understanding of demonstrative expressions as involving so-called "singular" or "Russellian" thoughts about particular objects that reflects the influence on his views of Gareth Evans. According to this view, if the putative object picked out by the demonstrative does not exist, then such an object dependent thought cannot exist – it is, in the most literal sense, not available to be thought.

===Value theory===
In parallel with the development of this work on mind and language, McDowell also made significant contributions to moral philosophy, specifically meta-ethical debates over the nature of moral reasons and moral objectivity. McDowell developed the view that has come to be known as secondary property realism, or sensibility or moral sense theory. The theory proceeds via the device of an ideally virtuous agent: such an agent has two connected capacities. She has the right concepts and the correct grasp of concepts to think about situations in which she finds herself by coming to moral beliefs. Secondly, for such a person such moral beliefs are automatically over-riding over other reasons she may have and in a particular way: they "silence" other reasons, as McDowell puts it. He believes that this is the best way to capture the traditional idea that moral reasons are specially authoritative.

McDowell also here departs from the standard interpretation of the Humean theory of how action is motivated. The Humean claims that any intentional action, hence any moral action, is motivated by a combination of two mental states, one a belief and one a desire. The belief functions as a passive representation; the desire functions to supply the distinctively motivational part of the combination. On the basis of his account of the virtuous moral agent, McDowell follows Thomas Nagel in rejecting this account as inaccurate: it is more truthful to say that in the case of a moral action, the virtuous agent's perception of the circumstances (that is, her belief) itself justifies both the action and the desire. For example, we cannot understand the desire, as a Humean original existence, without relating it back to the circumstances that impinged on the agent and made her feel compelled to act. So while the Humean thesis may be a truth about explanation it is not true about the structure of justification and it ought to be replaced by Nagel's motivated desire theory as set out in his ''The Possibility of Altruism'' (Oxford University Press, 1970).

Implicit in this account is a theory of the metaphysical status of values: moral agents form beliefs about the moral facts, which can be straightforwardly true or false. However, the facts themselves, like facts about colour experience, combine anthropocentricity with realism. Values are not there in the world for any observer, for example, one without our human interest in morality. However, in that sense, colours are not in the world either, but one cannot deny that colours are both present in our experience and needed for good explanations in our common sense understanding of the world. The test for the reality of a property is whether it is used in judgements for which there are developed standards of rational argument and whether they are needed to explain aspects of our experience that are otherwise inexplicable. McDowell thinks that moral properties pass both of these tests. There are established standards of rational argument and moral properties fall into the general class of those properties that are both anthropocentric but real.

The connection between McDowell's general metaphysics and this particular claim about moral properties is that all claims about objectivity are to be made from the internal perspective of our actual practices, the part of his view that he takes from the later Wittgenstein. There is no standpoint from outside our best theories of thought and language from which we can classify secondary properties as "second grade" or "less real" than the properties described, for example, by a mature science such as physics. Characterising the place of values in our worldview is not, in McDowell's view, to downgrade them as less real than talk of quarks or the Higgs boson.

===Later work:  ''Mind and World'' (1994)&lt;!--'Mind and World' redirects here--&gt;===
The later development of McDowell's work came more strongly to reflect the influence on him of [[Richard Rorty|Rorty]] and [[Wilfrid Sellars|Sellars]] and, in particular, both ''Mind and World'' and McDowell's later Woodbridge lectures focus on a broadly [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] understanding of intentionality, of the mind's capacity to represent. ''Mind and World'' sets itself the task of understanding the sense in which we are active even in our perceptual experience of the world. Influenced by Sellars's famous diagnosis of the "myth of the given" in traditional empiricism, in which Sellars argued that the blankly causal impingement of the external world on judgement failed to supply justification, as only something with a belief-like conceptual structure could engage with rational justification, McDowell tries to explain how one can accept that we are passive in our perceptual experience of the world while active in how we conceptualise it. McDowell develops an account of that which Kant called the "spontaneity" of our judgement in perceptual experience, while trying to avoid the suggestion that the resulting account has any connection with idealism.

''Mind and World'' rejects, in the course of its argument, the position that McDowell takes to be the working ideology of most of his philosophical contemporaries, namely, a reductively naturalistic account that McDowell labels "bald naturalism." He contrasts this view with what he deems to be his own "naturalistic" perspective in which the distinctive capacities of mind are a cultural achievement of our "second nature", an idea that he adapts from [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]]. The book concludes with a critique of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s narrow conception of empirical experience and also a critique of [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s views on belief as inherently veridical, in which Davidson plays the role of the pure [[Coherentism|coherentist]].

One of the hallmarks of McDowell's later work is his denial that there is any philosophical use for an idea that our experience contains representations that are not conceptually structured, so-called "non-conceptual content." Given that other philosophers claim that scientific accounts of our mental lives, particularly in the [[cognitive sciences]], need this idea, this claim of McDowell's has provoked a great deal of discussion. McDowell develops a stringent reading of Sellars' diagnosis of a "myth of the given" in perceptual experience to argue that we need always to separate out the exercise of concepts in experience from a causal account of the pre-conditions of experience and that the idea of "non-conceptual content" straddles this boundary in a philosophically unacceptable way.

While ''Mind and World'' represents an important contemporary development of a Kantian approach to philosophy of mind and metaphysics, one or two of the uncharitable interpretations of Kant's work in that book receive important revisions in McDowell's later Woodbridge Lectures, published in the ''Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 95, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;431–491. Those lectures are explicitly about Wilfrid Sellars, and assess whether or not Sellars lived up to his own critical principles in developing his interpretation of Kant (McDowell claims not).  McDowell has, since the publication of ''Mind and World,'' largely continued to re-iterate his distinctive positions that go against the grain of much contemporary work on language, mind and value, particularly in North America where the influence of Wittgenstein has significantly waned.

===Influences===

McDowell's work has been heavily influenced by, among others, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[P. F. Strawson]], [[David Wiggins]], and, especially in the case of his later work, [[Wilfrid Sellars]]. Many of the central themes in McDowell's work have also been pursued in similar ways by his [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] colleague [[Robert Brandom]] (though McDowell has stated strong disagreement with some of Brandom's readings and appropriations of his work). Both have been influenced by [[Richard Rorty]], in particular Rorty's ''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature'' (1979). In the preface to ''Mind and World'' (pp. ix–x) McDowell states that "it will be obvious that Rorty's work is [...] central for the way I define my stance here."  McDowell's own work has been criticized for its "sometimes cryptic prose."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Genova|first=A.

'''Judeo-Tunisian Arabic''', also known as '''Djerbian Arabic''', is a [[Varieties of Arabic|variety]] of [[Tunisian Arabic]] mainly spoken by [[Jew]]s living or formerly living in [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="jasher"&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.persee.fr/doc/hel_0750-8069_1996_num_18_1_2454 Bar-Asher, M. (1996). La recherche sur les parlers judéo-arabes modernes du Maghreb: état de la question. ''Histoire épistémologie langage'', 18(1), 167-177.]&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers are older adults, and the younger generation has only a passive knowledge of the language.&lt;ref name="ethn"/&gt;

The vast majority of [[Tunisian Jews]] have [[Mizrahi Jews in Israel|relocated to Israel]] and have [[language shift|shifted]] to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as their [[home language]].&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="judeoa"&gt;Bassiouney, R. (2009). ''Arabic sociolinguistics''. Edinburgh University Press, pp. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in France typically use [[French language|French]] as their primary language, while the few still left in Tunisia tend to use either French or Tunisian Arabic in their everyday lives.&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="judeoa" /&gt;

Judeo-Tunisian Arabic is one of the [[Judeo-Arabic languages]], a collection of Arabic dialects spoken by Jews living or formerly living in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="jasher" /&gt;

==History==

===Before 1901===
A Jewish community existed in what is today Tunisia even prior to [[Roman Empire|Roman rule]] in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].&lt;ref name="leddyc" /&gt; After the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Arabic conquest]] of [[North Africa]], this community began to use Arabic for their daily communication.&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt; They had adopted the pre-[[Hilalian dialects|Hilalian]] dialect of Tunisian Arabic as their own dialect.&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt; As Jewish communities tend to be close-knit and isolated from the other ethnic and religious communities of their countries,&lt;ref name="jasher" /&gt; their dialect spread to their coreligionists all over the country&lt;ref name="Djerba" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Saada, L. (1956). Introduction à l'étude du parler arabe des juifs de Sousse.&lt;/ref&gt; and had not been in contact with the languages of the communities that invaded Tunisia in the middle age.&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vnmalt" /&gt; The primary language contact with regard to Judeo-Tunisian Arabic came from the languages of Jewish communities that fled to Tunisia as a result of persecution like [[Judeo-Spanish]].&lt;ref name="leddyc" /&gt; This explains why Judeo-Tunisian Arabic lacks influence from the dialects of the [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]], and has developed several phonological and lexical particularities that distinguish it from Tunisian Arabic.&lt;ref name="vnmalt"&gt;{{fr}} Vanhove, M. (1998). [https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00009708/document De quelques traits préhilaliens en maltais]. ''Peuplement et Arabisation au Maghreb Occidental (Dialectologie et Histoire)'', 97-108. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cohen9"&gt;{{fr}} Cohen, D. (1970). Les deux parlers arabes de Tunis. Notes de phonologie comparee. In his ''Etudes de linguistique semitique et arabe'', 150(7).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Caubet, D. (2000). Questionnaire de dialectologie du Maghreb (d'après les travaux de W. Marçais, M. Cohen, GS Colin, J. Cantineau, D. Cohen, Ph. Marçais, S. Lévy, etc.). ''Estudios de dialectología norteafricana y andalusí, EDNA'', (5), 73-90.&lt;/ref&gt; This also explains why Judeo-Tunisian words are generally less removed from their etymological origin than Tunisian words.&lt;ref&gt;Aslanov, C. (2016). Remnants of Maghrebi Judeo-Arabic among French-born Jews of North-African Descent. ''Journal of Jewish Languages'', 4(1), 69-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 1901===
In 1901, Judeo-Tunisian became one of the main spoken Arabic dialects of Tunisia, with thousands of speakers.&lt;ref name="leddyc" /&gt; Linguists noted the unique character of this dialect, and subjected it to study.&lt;ref name="leddyc" /&gt; Among the people studying Judeo-Tunisian Arabic, Daniel Hagege listed a significant amount of Judeo-Tunisian Arabic newspapers from the early 1900s in his essay ''The Circulation of Tunisian Judeo-Arabic Books''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Judeo-Arabic Literature In Tunisia, 1850-1950|last=Tobi|first=Joseph|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-8143-2871-2|location=Detroit, Michigan|pages=241–320}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its emergence has significantly declined since 1948 due to the [[creation of Israel]].&lt;ref name="leddyc" /&gt; In fact, the Jewish community of Tunisia has either chosen to leave or was forced to leave Tunisia and immigrate to [[France]] or [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="judeoa" /&gt; Nowadays, the language is largely extinct throughout most of Tunisia, even if it is still used by the small Jewish communities in Tunis, Gabes and Djerba,&lt;ref name="Djerba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="digizeitschriften.de" /&gt; and most of the Jewish communities that have left Tunisia have chosen to change their language of communication to the main language of their current country.&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;

===Current situation===
'''Language vitality:''' Judeo-Tunisian Arabic is believed to be vulnerable with only 500 speakers in [[Tunisia]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/|website=Unesco.org|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with about 45,000 speakers in [[Israel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabic, Judeo-Tunisian|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/ajt|website=Ethologue Languages of the World|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language variations:''' In Tunisia, geography plays a huge role in how Judeo-Tunisian Arabic varies between speakers.&lt;ref name="henshke"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henshke|first1=Yehudit|title=Different Hebrew Traditions: Mapping Regional Distinctions in the Hebrew Component of Spoken Tunisian Judeo-Arabic|journal=Studies in the History and Culture of North African Jewry|date=2010|page=109 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10336681/Henshke_Y._Different_Hebrew_Traditions_._In_Studies_in_the_History_and_Culture_of_North_African_Jewry_ed._M._Bar-Asher_and_S._Fraade_109-_124._Yale_University_Press_2|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, Tunisian Judeo-Arabic can vary depending on the region in which it is spoken.&lt;ref name="henshke" /&gt; Accordingly, the main dialects of Judeo-Tunisian Arabic are:&lt;ref name="henshke" /&gt;
* The dialect of the North of Tunisia (Mainly spoken in Tunis)
* The dialect of the South of Tunisia (Mainly Spoken in Gabes)
* The dialect of the islands off the coast of the country (Mainly spoken in Djerba)
In addition, Judeo-Tunisian can vary within the same region based on the town in which it is spoken.&lt;ref name="henshke" /&gt;

==Distinctives from Tunisian Arabic==
Like all other [[Judeo-Arabic languages]], Judeo-Tunisian Arabic does not seem to be very different from the Arabic dialect from which it derives, [[Tunisian Arabic]].&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jasher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="talmoudi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammet|first1=Sandra|title=Irregular verbs in Maltese and Their Counterparts in The Tunisian and Moroccan Dialects|journal=Romano-Arabica|date=2014|volume=14|pages=193–210 |url=http://araba.lls.unibuc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Romano-Arabica-Nr.-XIV-2014.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arevalo|first1=Tania Marica Garcia|title=The General Linguistic Features of Modern Judeo-Arabic Dialects in the Maghreb|journal=Zutot|date=2014|volume=11|pages=54–56 |url= http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edselc&amp;AN=edselc.2-52.0-84939610347&amp;site=eds-live |accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Phonology:''' There are three main differences between [[Tunisian Arabic]] phonology and Judeo-Tunisian Arabic phonology:
** '''Substitution of phonemes:''' Mostly unlike [[Tunisian Arabic]] dialects, Judeo-Tunisian Arabic has merged Tunisian Arabic's glottal [{{IPA link|ʔ}}] and [{{IPA link|h}}] into [{{IPA link|ø}}],&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="leddyc" /&gt; Interdental [{{IPA link|ð}}] and [{{IPA link|θ}}] have respectively been merged with [{{IPA link|d}}] and [{{IPA link|t}}],&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="leddyc" /&gt; [[Dhah|Ḍah]] and [[Ḍād]] have been merged as [{{IPA link|dˤ}}] and not as [{{IPA link|ðˤ}}],&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="leddyc" /&gt; [[Pre-Hilalian Arabic dialects|Prehilalian]] /aw/ and /ay/ [[diphthongs]] have been kept&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="leddyc" /&gt; (except in [[Gabes]]&lt;ref name="digizeit01" /&gt;), and [{{IPA link|χ}}] and [{{IPA link|ʁ}}] have been respectively substituted by [{{IPA link|x}}] and [{{IPA link|ɣ}}].&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="leddyc" /&gt; This is mainly explained by the difference between the language contact submitted by Jewish communities in Tunisia and the one submitted by Tunisian people.&lt;ref name="leddyc"&gt;[https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/sites/www.ldc.upenn.edu/files/leddy-cecere-thesis.pdf Leddy-Cecere, T. A. (2010). ''Contact, Restructuring, and Decreolization: The Case of Tunisian Arabic''. University of Pennsylvania, pp. 47-71.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
** '''Sibilant conversion:''' 
*** [{{IPA link|ʃ}}] and [{{IPA link|ʒ}}] are realized as [{{IPA link|sˤ}}] and [{{IPA link|zˤ}}] if there is an [[emphatic consonant]] or [{{IPA link|q}}] later in the word (however in [[Gabes]] this change takes effect if [{{IPA link|ʃ}}] and [{{IPA link|ʒ}}] are either before or after an [[emphatic consonant]] or [{{IPA link|q}}]).&lt;ref name="digizeitschriften.de" /&gt; For example, راجل rājil (meaning man) is pronounced in Gabes dialect of Judeo-Tunisian Arabic as /rˤa:zˤel/ and حجرة ḥajra (meaning stone) is pronounced in all Judeo-Tunisian dialects as /ħazˤrˤa/.&lt;ref name="digizeitschriften.de" /&gt; 
*** [{{IPA link|ʃ}}] and [{{IPA link|ʒ}}] are realized as [{{IPA link|s}}] and [{{IPA link|z}}] if there is an [{{IPA link|r}}] later in the word (Not applicable to the dialect of [[Gabes]]).&lt;ref name="digizeitschriften.de" /&gt; For example, جربة jirba (meaning [[Djerba]]) is pronounced in all Judeo-Tunisian dialects except the one of Gabes as /zerba/.&lt;ref name="digizeitschriften.de" /&gt;
** '''Chibilant conversion:''' Unlike in the other [[Judeo-Arabic languages]] of the [[Maghreb]],&lt;ref name="cohen1" /&gt; [{{IPA link|sˤ}}], [{{IPA link|s}}] and [{{IPA link|z}}] are realized as [{{IPA link|ʃ}}], [{{IPA link|ʃ}}] and [{{IPA link|ʒ}}] in several situations.&lt;ref name="digizeitschriften.de" /&gt; 
*** [{{IPA link|sˤ}}] is realized as [{{IPA link|ʃ}}] if there is not another emphatic consonant or a [{{IPA link|q}}] within the word (only applicable to Gabes dialect) or if this [{{IPA link|sˤ}}] is directly followed by a [{{IPA link|d}}].&lt;ref name="digizeit01" /&gt; For example, صدر ṣdir (meaning [[chest]]) is pronounced as /ʃder/&lt;ref name="digizeit01"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sumikazu|first1=Yoda|title="Sifflant" and "Chuintant" in the Arabic Dialect of the Jews of Gabes (south Tunisia)|journal=Zeitschrift für Arabische Linguistik|volume=46|pages=16 |url= http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/resolveppn/?PID=PPN513339353_0046%7CLOG_0010 |accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and صف ṣaff (meaning [[queue area|queue]]) is pronounced in Gabes dialect of Judeo-Tunisian Arabic as /ʃaff/.
*** [{{IPA link|s}}] and [{{IPA link|z}}] are respectively realized as [{{IPA link|ʃ}}] and [{{IPA link|ʒ}}] if there is no emphatic consonant, no [{{IPA link|q}}] and no [{{IPA link|r}}] later in the word (In Gabes, this change takes effect if there is no [{{IPA link|q}}] and no emphatic consonant within the word). For example, زبدة zibda (meaning [[butter]]) is pronounced as /ʒebda/.&lt;ref name="digizeitschriften.de" /&gt;
** '''Emphasis of [s] and [z]:''' Further than the possible conversion of [{{IPA link|s}}] and [{{IPA link|z}}] by [{{IPA link|sˤ}}] and [{{IPA link|zˤ}}] due to the phenomenon of the [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]] of adjacent consonants (also existing in [[Tunisian Arabic]]),&lt;ref name="talmoudi" /&gt; [{{IPA link|s}}] and [{{IPA link|z}}] are also realized as [{{IPA link|sˤ}}] and [{{IPA link|zˤ}}] if there is an [[emphatic consonant]] or [{{IPA link|q}}] later in the word (however in [[Gabes]] this change takes effect if [{{IPA link|ʃ}}] and [{{IPA link|ʒ}}] are either before or after an [[emphatic consonant]] or [{{IPA link|q}}]).&lt;ref name="digizeitschriften.de" /&gt; For example, سوق sūq (meaning [[market (place)|market]]) is pronounced in Judeo-Tunisian Arabic as /sˤu:q/.&lt;ref name="digizeitschriften.de" /&gt;
** '''[q] and [g] phonemes:''' Unlike the Northwestern, Southeastern and Southwestern dialects of Tunisian Arabic, Judeo-Tunisian Arabic does not systematically substitute Classical Arabic [{{IPA link|q}}] by [{{IPA link|g}}].&lt;ref name="cohen1" /&gt; Also, the [{{IPA link|g}}] phoneme existing in Tunis, Sahil and Sfax dialects of Tunisian Arabic is rarely maintained&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, D. (1973). Variantes, variétés dialectales et contacts linguistiques en domaine arabe. Bulletin de la Société de Linguistique de Paris, 68(1), 233.&lt;/ref&gt; and is mostly substituted by a [{{IPA link|q}}] in Judeo-Tunisian.&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt; For example, بقرة (cow) is pronounced as /bagra/ in Tunis, Sahil and Sfax dialects of Tunisian Arabic and as /baqra/ in Judeo-Tunisian.&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;
* '''Morphology:''' The [[Tunisian Arabic morphology|morphology]] is quite the same as the one of [[Tunisian Arabic]].&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jasher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="talmoudi"&gt;Talmoudi, Fathi (1979) ''The Arabic Dialect of Sûsa (Tunisia)''. Göteborg: Acta Universitatis Gothoburgensis.&lt;/ref&gt; However:
** Judeo-Tunisian Arabic sometimes uses some particular morphological structures such as typical clitics like qa- that is used to denote the progressivity of a given action.&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cuvalay, M. (1991). The expression of durativity in Arabic. ''The Arabist, Budapest studies in Arabic'', 3-4, 146.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''qayākil'' means he is eating.
** Unlike [[Tunisian Arabic]], Judeo-Tunisian Arabic is characterized by its overuse of the [[passive form]].&lt;ref name="cohend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vnmalt" /&gt;
** The informal lack of [[subject-verb agreement]] found in [[Tunisian Arabic|Tunisian]] and in [[Modern Standard Arabic]] does not exist in Judeo-Tunisian Arabic. For example, we say ed-dyār '''tebnēu''' الديار '''تبناوا''' and not ed-dyār '''tebnēt''' الديار '''تبنات''' (The houses were built).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Taieb, J., &amp; Sayah, M. (2003).

* '''Vocabulary:''' There are some differences between the vocabulary of [[Tunisian Arabic]] and the one of Judeo-Tunisian Arabic. Effectively:
** Unlike [[Tunisian Arabic]], Judeo-Tunisian Arabic has a Hebrew [[Stratum (linguistics)#Adstratum|adstratum]].&lt;ref name="Djerba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jasher" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chetrit, J. (2014). Judeo-Arabic Dialects in North Africa as Communal Languages: Lects, Polylects, and Sociolects. ''Journal of Jewish Languages'', 2(2), 202-232.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Cohen said that almost 5 percent of the Judeo-Tunisian words are from Hebrew origin.&lt;ref name="cohen1"&gt;Cohen, D. (1981). Remarques historiques et sociolinguistiques sur les parlers arabes des juifs maghrébins. ''International Journal of the Sociology of Language'', 1981(30), 91-106.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Judeo-Tunisian has acquired several specific words that do not exist in Tunisian like ''Ladino'' from language contact with [[Judaeo-Romance languages]].&lt;ref name="cohen1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Dufour, Y. R. (1998). ''[http://modia.org/infos/israel/tunelang.html La langue parlée des Tunes]''. modia.org. Retrieved 24 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Unlike most of the [[Tunisian Arabic]] dialect and as it is [[Pre-Hilalian Arabic dialects|Pre-Hilalian]], Judeo-Tunisian kept Pre-Hilalian vocabulary usage patterns.&lt;ref name="ckoinè"&gt;{{fr}} Cohen, D. (1962). Koinè, langues communes et dialectes arabes. ''Arabica'', 9(2), 122.&lt;/ref&gt; For example rā را is used instead of šūf شوف (commonly used in [[Tunisian Arabic|Tunisian]]) to mean "to see".&lt;ref name="ckoinè" /&gt;
** Unlike the Tunis dialect of [[Tunisian Arabic]],&lt;ref name="cohen9" /&gt; Judeo-Tunisian Arabic is also known for the profusion of diminutives.&lt;ref name="cohen9" /&gt; For example:
*** q'''ṭ'''ay'''ṭ'''as قطيطس (little or friendly cat) for qa'''ṭṭ'''ūs قطّوس (cat).&lt;ref name="cohen9" /&gt; 
*** k'''l'''ayi'''b''' كليب (little or friendly dog) for ka'''lb''' كلب (dog).&lt;ref name="cohen9" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5480">A '''lapsus''' ([[Latin]] for "lapse, slip, error") is an involuntary mistake made while writing or speaking, something long studied in [[philology]].&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Greetham, ''Scholarly Editing'' (1995)p. 452&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
In 1895 an investigation into verbal slips was undertaken by a philologist and a psychologist, [[Rudolf Meringer]] and [[Karl Meyer (psychologist)|Karl Meyer]], who collected a large number of examples and divided them into separate types.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalysis===
Freud was to become interested in such mistakes from 1897 onwards, developing an interpretation of slips in terms of their unconscious meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for our Time'' (1989) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently followers of his like [[Ernest Jones]] developed the theme of lapsus in connection with writing, typing, and misprints.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Greetham, ''Theories of the Text'' (1999) p. 249-252&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s early [[psychoanalytic theory]], a lapsus represents a bungled act that hides an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] desire: “the phenomena can be traced back to incompletely suppressed psychical material...pushed away by consciousness”.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, quoted in A. Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan]] would thoroughly endorse the Freudian interpretation of unconscious motivation in the slip, arguing that “in the ''lapsus'' it is...clear that every unsuccessful act is a successful, not to say 'well-turned', discourse”.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventies [[Sebastiano Timpanaro]] would controversially take up the question again, by offering a mechanistic explanation of all such slips, in opposition to Freud's theories.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 755&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of lapsus==

In literature, a number of different types of lapsus are named depending on the mode of correspondence:&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Speech error|lapsus linguae]]'' (pl. same): slip of the tongue 
* ''[[wikt:lapsus calami|lapsus calami]]'': slip of the pen&lt;ref&gt;B. A. Garner, ''Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage'' (1995) p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; With the variation of ''lapsus clavis'': slip of the typewriter
* ''[[wikt:lapsus manus|lapsus manus]]'': slip of the hand, similar to ''lapsus calami''
* ''[[wikt:lapsus memoriae|lapsus memoriae]]'': slip of memory

=== Types of slips of the tongue ===
Slips of the tongue can happen on any level:
*[[Syntaxis|Syntactic]] - ''is'' instead of ''was''.
*Phrasal slips of tongue - ''I'll explain this tornado later''. 
*Lexical/semantic - ''moon full'' instead of ''full moon''.
*[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphological]] level - ''working'''s''' paper''
*Phonological (sound slips) - ''flow snurries'' instead of ''snow flurries''

Additionally, each of these five levels of error may take various forms:
*[[Anticipation]]s: Where an early output item is corrupted by an element belonging to a later one,&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; thus "reading list" - "leading list"
*Perseverations or post-sonances: Where a later output item is corrupted by an element belonging to an earlier one&lt;ref&gt;Greetham, ''Theories'' p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "waking rabbits" - "waking wabbits".
*Deletions: Where an output element is somehow totally lost, thus "same state" - "same sate"
*Shift: Moving a letter, thus "black foxes" - "back floxes"
*Haplologies&lt;ref&gt;This is a different phenomenon from that described in the main article on [[Haplology|haplologies]], which involves the removal of identical consecutive syllables.&lt;/ref&gt; or fusion: Half one word and half the other, thus "stummy" instead of "stomach or tummy"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 58-9&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pun]]&lt;ref&gt;B. M. Dupriez, ''Dictionary of Literary Devices'' (1991) p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
Meringer and Meyer highlighted the role of familiar associations and similarities of words and sounds in producing the lapsus. Freud objected that such factors did not cause but only “''favour'' slips of the tongue...in the immense majority of cases my speech is not disturbed by the circumstance that the words I am using recall others with a similar sound...or that familiar associations branch off from them”.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Timpanaro later reignited the debate,&lt;ref&gt;P. Barrotta et al, ''Freud and Italian Culture'' (2009) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; by maintaining that any given slip can always be explained mechanically without a need for deeper motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Greetham, ''Theories'' p. 257-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. L. Austin]] had independently seen slips not as revealing a particular complex, but as an ineluctable feature of the human condition, necessitating a continual preparation for excuses and remedial work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Cavell]], ''Little Did I Know'' (2010) p. 479&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Makhuwa''' (''Emakhuwa''; also spelt '''Makua''' and '''Macua''') is the primary [[Bantu language]] of northern [[Mozambique]]. It is spoken by 4 million [[Makua people]], who live north of the [[Zambezi River]], particularly in [[Nampula Province]], which is virtually entirely ethnically Makua.&lt;ref name="NELIMO"&gt;''Relatório do I Seminário sobre a Padronização da Ortografia de Línguas Moçambicanas''. NELIMO, Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most widely spoken indigenous language of Mozambique.

Apart from the languages in the same group, '''eMakhuwa''' is distinguished from other Bantu languages by the loss of consonant + vowel prefixes in favour of ''e''; compare ''epula'', "rain", with [[Tswana language|Tswana]] ''pula''.

Long and short vowels are used for ''i, e, a, o, u'', which is unusually sparse for a Bantu language:

*''omala'' - to finish
*''omaala'' - to paste, stick
*''omela'' - to sprout, bud
*''omeela'' - to share out

The consonants are more complex: postalveolar ''tt'' and ''tth'' exist, both ''p'' and ''ph'' are used. Both ''x'' (English "sh") and ''h'' exist while ''x'' varies with ''s''. Regionally, there are also ''θ'' (the "th" of English "thorn"), ''ð'' (the "th" of English "seethe"), ''z'' and ''ng''. In [[eLomwe]], for instance, the ''-tt-'' of eMakhuwa is represented by a "ch" as in English "church".&lt;ref name="NELIMO" /&gt;

Makhuwa is closely related to [[Lomwe language|Lomwe]].

==Dialects==
The names of the dialects vary in different sources. The shibboleth or distinctive variant in the dialects is the treatment of the ''s'':

* eSamgagi dialect: ''odhiva''
* eSangagi dialect: ''θtiva''
* eSaaka dialect: ''ociva''
* eNahara dialect: ''oziva'' - all meaning "agreeable, pleasant" &lt;ref name="NELIMO" /&gt;

Maho (2009) lists the following dialects:&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;

* Central Makhuwa (3.1 million)
* Meetto (Metto) (1.3 million, including Ruvuma)
* Chirima (Shirima) (1.5 million, including subdialects Kokola, Lolo, Manyawa, Marenje, Takwane)
* Marrevone (Coastal Makhuwa; 460,000 including eNahara)
* eNahara (Naharra)
* eSaka (Saka, 210,000)
* Ruvuma Makhuwa (Tanzanian Makhuwa, including subdialects Imithupi, Ikorovere)

[[Mutual intelligibility]] between these is limited. Central Makhuwa ("Makhuwa-Makhuwana") is the basis of the standard language. ''Ethnologue'' lists Central Makhuwa, Meetto–Ruvuma, Marrevone–Enahara, and Esaka as separate languages, and Chirima as six languages.

The population figures are from ''Ethnologue'' for 2006. They tally 3.1 million speakers of Central Makhuwa and 3.5 million of the other varieties, though the ''Ethnologue'' article for Central Makhuwa covers Marrevone and Enahara, so these might be double counted.

==Reading matter in eMakhuwa==

''Muluku Onnalavuliha Àn'awe - Ipantte sikosolasiwe sa Biblia'' ("God speaks to his children" - extracts from the Scriptures for children) Aid to the Church in Need. Edição em Macúa / eMakhuwa) Editorial Verbo Divino, Estella, Navarra, 1997.

Makuva has been heavily influenced by neighboring [[East Timor languages|East Timorese Papuan languages]], to the extent that it was long thought to be a Papuan language. The ethnic population was 50 in 1981, but the younger generation uses [[Fataluku language|Fataluku]] as their first or second language.

'''Mammad Said Ordubadi''' ({{lang-az|Məmməd Səid Ordubadi}}; 24 March 1872, [[Ordubad]] - 1 May 1950, [[Baku]]) was  [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] [[writer]], [[poet]], [[playwright]] and [[journalist]]. 

Ordubadi, started his career as a poet. His articles and poetry were published in many of the megazines in [[Azerbaijani language]] at that time. During the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Iranian Constitutional Revolution]], Ordubadi joined [[Muslim Social Democratic Party]] (Hummet). He then published ''Bloody Years'' about the [[Armenian–Tatar massacres of 1905–1907|clashes between Armenian and Azerbaijani populations in 1905]]. In 1918, he joined to Communist Party and his articles have published in the official newspaper of Hummet organization. He, along with XI Red Army, goes to [[Dagestan]] and publishes ''Red Dagestan'' magazine there. After the [[Red Army invasion of Azerbaijan|Sovietization of Azerbaijan]] he returns to Baku.

Today, Ordubadi is remembered as one of the most important intellectuals of Azerbaijan during Soviet era. He served twice as a deputy of the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR]], the highest legislative institution in the country. His novels include ''Sword and the Pen'', about the personality of [[Nizami Ganjavi]], ''[[Foggy Tabriz]]'' about the [[Iranian constitutional revolution]], also ''Mysterious Baku'' and ''Fighting City'' which both are about the revolutionary activities of [[Bolsheviks]] and [[26 Baku Commissars]]. He also published articles about ''Narimanovism'' about the activity of national communism symbol in Azerbaijan, [[Nariman Narimanov]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was initially educated at religious school, [[medrese]], and later studied at Mahammad Sidgi's secular school ''"Əxtər"'' (Star). Mahammad Sidgi was well-known intellectual for his enlightenment activity in Russian [[Azerbaijan]] and the rest of [[Caucasus]] in the beginning of the 20th century. 

Mammed Said lost his father at early age and had to work in a textile factory.

===Works===
He started writing in the 1890s. His first writing was published in [[Tbilisi]] (then [[Tiflis]]) in a newspaper "[[Shargi-Rus]]" (''Oriental Russia'') in 1903. In his early publications Ordubadi criticised ignorance, backwardness and religious fanaticism. In 1906 in [[Tbilisi]] he published his poetry book ''"Qəflət"'' (Ignorance) and in 1907 ''"Vətən və hürriyyət"'' ''(Fatherland and Freedom)''. He wrote for several Azerbaijani publications, including ''"Molla Nasraddin", "Irshad", "Sada"'' and others. Ordubadi covered various political, social and educational issues. He firmly stood for the necessity of the enlightenment of the Azerbaijani society under the Russian rule. In 1911, Ordubadi published a book ''"Qanlı sənələr"'' (Bloody years) - collection of first hand accounts of the [[Armenian-Tatar massacres]] in 1905-1906. In the 1910s, Ordubadi published several plays, stories and novels. In 1915, Russian authorities arrested him and exiled to [[Tsaritsyn]]. In 1918, he joined the Communist Party and returned to [[Baku]] in May 1920, after the Bolshevik conquest of Azerbaijan. 

Ordubadi became the editor-in-chief of ''"Əxbar", "Yeni yol", "Molla Nasraddin".'' 

During the Soviet period, Ordubadi wrote extensively novels, satiric stories, plays, librettos (to operas - ''"Koroğlu", "Nərgiz", "Nizami"''). His famous works include ''"Dumanlı Təbriz"'' ([[Foggy Tabriz]]) (1933–1948) and ''"Qılınc və qələm"'' (Sword and Quill) (1946–1948). He wrote novels about  poets and writers - [[Nizami Ganjavi]], [[Fuzûlî]], [[Molla Panah Vagif]], [[Mirza Alakbar Sabir]].

'''A military stamp''', is a [[postage stamp]] used by a military organisation, in time of war, or while ensuring a peace keeping operation.  Often the letters will be transported by the army itself until they reach the country of destination.  These stamps were widely used during [[World War II]] by soldiers wishing to send mail home to their families.  The usage of these stamps has been somewhat phased out by the appearance of electronic means of communication.

The portfolio was created to promote the use of the [[Irish language]] throughout the country.  The post was abolished after little over a year in existence, after the conclusion of formal independence negotiations with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]]. In 1956 the position was revived to a certain extent with the creation of the new title of [[Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs|Minister for the Gaeltacht]].

The '''Momo languages''' are a branch of the [[Southern Bantoid languages]] spoken in the [[Western grassfields]] of [[Cameroon]].

The languages are:
:[[Meta' language|Meta']] (Moghamo)–[[Ngamambo language|Ngamambo]], [[Mundani language|Mundani]], [[Ngie language|Ngie]] (Mengum), [[Ngoshie language|Ngoshie]], [[Ngwo language|Ngwo]] (Basa, Konda), [[Njen language|Njen]], [[Amasi language|Amasi]]&lt;!--no ISO code--&gt;

''Ethnologue'' 16 adds [[Menka language|Menka]], but that is a [[Southwest Grassfields languages|Southwest Grassfields]] (West Momo) language. 

Blench (2010) notes there is little evidence that Momo belongs among the [[Grassfields languages]] as it has been traditionally classified. (The erstwhile West Momo languages are clearly in the Grassfields family.) Momo may actually be closer to the poorly established [[Tivoid languages|Tivoid]] group, though that may be an effect of contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/Bantoid/Grassfields/Momo/Classification%20of%20Momo%20and%20West%20Momo.pdf|title=Classification of Momo and West Momo|last=Blenh|first=Roger|date=2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''N.M. Mohan''' (1949-2012) was an Indian [[Comic book creator|comics writer]], editor, magazine and advertisement designer, visualiser and architectural consultant.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Thomas. "Mohippicha Oreyoru Mohan". Malayala Manorama [Kottayam] 13 December 2012: 10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the pioneers of comic magazine publication in [[Malayalam]] and creator of a number of popular comics characters in Kerala.&lt;ref name="thehindu1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Special Correspondent |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/journalist-nm-mohan-dead/article4194324.ece |title=Today's Paper / NATIONAL : Journalist N.M.

In collaboration with several artists and comics creators, most notably Pradeep Sathe, he prepared [[Mayavi]], Luttappi and many other fictional characters, introducing simple, naturalistic themes and played a major role in rise of both ''Poompatta'' and ''Balarama'' comics.

Mohan was born to N.G. Bhaskaran Nair, a businessman from [[Palai|Pala]], in 1949. He studied at [[St. Thomas College, Pala|St. Thomas College]], Pala and NSS College, [[Changanassery]]. He was married to Latha, daughter of [[Vaikom Chandrasekharan Nair]], and their children are currently working in some of the prestigious dailies in India. He lived at Palamundakkal House, Cherunarakam Road, Nattasserry, Kottayam.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Mohan started his career in the general interest magazine ''Chithrakarthika'' (published from Trivandrum by Vaikom Chandrasekharan Nair). He later shifted to ''Poompatta'', one of the pioneering comic magazines in Malayalam, and served as the Editor-in-Charge of ''Balarama'' from 1983 to 2012. He played major role in the publication of several of its sister publications such as ''Balarama Digest'', Malayalam ''[[Amar Chitra Katha]]'', ''Magic Pot'' and ''Tell Me Why''.&lt;ref name="thehindu1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

'''Pano-Tacanan''' (also '''Pano-Takana''', '''Pano-Takánan''', '''Pano-Tacana''', '''Páno-Takána''') is a proposed family of languages spoken in [[Peru]], western [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]] and northern [[Paraguay]]. There are two close-knit branches, [[Panoan]] and [[Tacanan]] (Adelaar &amp; Muysken 2004; Kaufman 1990, 1994), with 33 languages. There are lexical and grammatical similarities between the two branches, but it has not yet been demonstrated that these are genetic (Loos 1999).

Most Panoan languages are spoken in either Peru or western Brazil; a few are in Bolivia. All Tacanan languages are spoken in Bolivia (Ese’ejja is also spoken in Peru).

==Genealogical relations==

{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

Migliazza has presented lexical evidence in support of a genetic relationship between the Panoan and [[Yanomaman languages|Yanomaman]] languages.  He also urges that a Panoan–[[Chibchan]] relationship is plausible.&lt;ref&gt;American Indian Languages, Oxford Studies in Anthropological Linguistics, Campbell, Lyle, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3716">[[File:Camara PTZ.jpg|alt=Ventech ptz camera outdoor|thumb|300x300px|Ventech PTZ Camera]]
A '''pan–tilt–zoom camera''' ('''PTZ camera''') is a camera that is capable of remote directional and zoom control.

In [[television production]], PTZ controls are used with [[professional video camera]]s in [[television studio]]s, sporting events, and other spaces. They are commonly referred to as '''robos''', an abbreviation of '''robotic camera'''. These systems can be remotely controlled by [[automation]] systems. The PTZ controls are generally sold separately without the cameras, but can also be sold as a set, as in the case of Fletcher cameras.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportsvideo.org/2015/05/12/svg-sit-down-fletcher-sports-grainge-talks-new-facility-growth-of-high-speed-camera-market/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ventech PTZ controller.jpg|alt=controller for ptz cameras|thumb|200x200px|Ventech ptz controller]]
PTZ is an abbreviation for [[Panning (camera)|pan]], [[Tilt (camera)|tilt]] and [[Zoom lens|zoom]] and reflects the movement options of the camera. Other types of cameras are ePTZ or virtual pan-tilt-zoom (VPTZ) where a high-resolution camera digitally zooms and pans into portions of the image, with no physical camera movement. Ultra-low bandwidth surveillance streaming technologies use VPTZ to stream user-defined areas in higher quality without increasing overall bandwidth usage. [[Surveillance camera]]s of this type are often connected to a [[digital video recorder]] which records the full field of view in full quality.

PTZ Cameras are commonly used in applications such as surveillance, video conferencing, live production, lecture capture and distance learning.

==Auto tracking==
An innovation to the PTZ camera is a built-in firmware program that monitors the change of pixels generated by the video clip in the camera. When the pixels change due to movement within the camera's field of view, the camera can actually focus on the pixel variation and move the camera in an attempt to center the pixel fluctuation on the video chip. This results in the camera following movement. The program allows the camera to estimate the size of the object which is moving and distance of the movement from the camera. With this estimate, the camera can adjust the camera's optical lens, zooming in and out, in an attempt to stabilize the size of pixel fluctuation as a percentage of total viewing area. Once the movement exits the camera's field of view, the camera returns to a pre-programmed or "parked" position until it senses pixel variation and the process starts over again.

==Video surveillance==
Pan-tilt-zoom cameras can be an essential part of modern surveillance systems. They can direct the attention to suspicious events. One method of surveillance with such cameras is based on master cameras monitoring a wide area that provide information so the PTZ camera can pan and tilt to the required position and observe and/or follow target movements.&lt;ref name=book2009&gt; A. Del Bimbo, F. Dini, F. Pernici ''Multi-Camera Networks, Principles and Applications'', Academic Press, Florence, 2009, p. 189-211&lt;/ref&gt;

It belongs to the [[Bantu languages]], Code A26 according to [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|Guthrie classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goto.glocalnet.net/mahopapers/nuglonline.pdf |year=2009 |title=NUGL Online: The online version of the New Updated Guthrie List, a referential classification of the Bantu languages |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607210512/http://goto.glocalnet.net/mahopapers/nuglonline.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isubu/Wovia media|work=Documentation de Langues en danger|url=http://dobes.mpi.nl/projects/isubu_wovia/language/?lang=fr|publisher=The Language Archive (TLA),  Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics |location=Nijmegen (Netherlands)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
{{wikt|dialectometry}}
The Pongo language is, according to [[dialectometrics]] data, closest to the [[Douala]] standard, with which it seems to share nearly 95% of its basic vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Dialectometrie Lexicale des parlers sawabantu|last = Carl|first = Ebobisse|date = 1989|journal = Journal of West African Languages|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both languages are mutually intelligible despite some difficulties on the Douala side due to limited exposure to the Pongo dialect. The Douala dialect is used as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in the [[Littoral Region (Cameroon)|Littoral region]] between members of the [[Sawabantu languages|Sawabantu]] ethnic group. The standard Douala has been used to evangelize in the region and is the preferred language of the [[Makossa]] musical genre.

== Geography ==

The town of [[Dibombari]] is the centre of Pongo. This area is located north of the city of [[Douala]], above the [[Bonabéri]] district. The term "Pongo" is also used to designate the north cardinal point in Douala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dictionnaire Duala-Français Suivi d'un Lexique Français-Duala|last = Helmlinger|first = Paul|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There, the Pongo tribe coexists with other ethnic groups such as the [[Bankon]] and the [[Mpoo]].   
[[File:Duala ethnic groups.png|thumb|The Pongo Tribe (Mungo), shown in green.]]

== Grammar ==

Pongo differs from Duala in the use of the verb ''èndè'' instead of the verb ''wala ''(to go), unusual in Douala, which serves as an [[auxiliary verb]] in the [[future tense]] in both languages. Another noticeable difference is the use of the conjunction ''ndi'' ("but") instead of ''ndé'' and a tendency to favor the [[phoneme]] ''/ [[d]] /'' over / [[l]] /. For example: Ekwali, written Ekwadi ("History") in Douala, becomes systematically Ekwadi in Pongo. In addition, the Douala prefix ''ma'', usually placed before the basic form of the verb, is replaced by an'' n', ''in Pongo. An example is the Douala sentence "'''di ma topo, ndé ba bato si ma senga'''", which becomes in Pongo "''di n'topo Di , ndi ba bato n'senga"'' "we talk, but people do not listen."

== Vocabulary ==
Comparative glossary of Douala and Pongo dialects. Boxes with two words indicate that these words are both present in the dialect and that they are interchangeable.

[[Image:GB Edward VIII Postage Stamps.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The four stamps  issued in 1936 for the UK's Edward VIII include the three UPU standard colors of green, red, and blue.]]
The [[color]]s of [[postage stamp]]s are at once obvious, and among the most difficult areas of [[philately]]. Different [[Denomination (postage stamp)|denominations]] of stamps have been printed in different colors since the very beginning; as with their successors, postal clerks could distinguish the [[Penny Black]] and [[Two pence blue]] more quickly by color than by reading the value, and the practice generally continues today. In practice, the actual color of a stamp may vary, and while collectors will pay high prices for rare shades, it may not be easy to tell those apart from variations caused by age, light, chemicals, and other factors. Stamp colors are routinely described by [[color name]] rather with any sort of a numerical system like [[CMYK]]; several '''color guides''' showing a selection of colors have been produced, but are not especially popular with collectors.

Nearly all stamps get their color from [[ink]]s printed on white or light-colored [[postage stamp paper|paper]]; the handful of exceptions include early issues of [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] consisting only of [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]] on colored paper, some recent stamps embossed on gold foil or with [[foil blocking]] to achieve a metallic appearance, and the [[Uganda Cowries]] produced on a [[typewriter]]. A number of early stamps were printed in black on differently-colored papers; the most famous example is the [[British Guiana 1c magenta]].

== History ==
[[Image:Stamp US 1914 2c.jpg|right|thumb|Red was the UPU standard for domestic letters; the 2c rate in the US lasted from 1883-1917 and 1919-1932.]]

Initially, countries typically made a random choice of colors for denominations. In 1896, the members of the [[Universal Postal Union]] agreed on [[green]], [[red]], and [[blue]] as the standard colors for standard printed matter, postcard, and letter rates, respectively, when sent '''abroad'''. This convention was gradually abandoned as inflation created too many exceptions from the 1930s and onwards.

[[Image:Stamp Switzerland 1850 10r.jpg|right|thumb|Switzerland used three colors in 1850 for its first stamps, then switched to a single-color design in 1854.]]

Stamps with two colors ("bi-colored") began to appear very early, although typically reserved for higher values, due to the added expense of multiple print runs.   Multicolored stamps appeared along with the development of color printing techniques; they now account for the majority of modern stamps, although single-color designs are still common, more so for some countries than others.

== Shades and color changes ==

Color shades have several different causes. The printer may use a different ink; in the early days, inks were made up in batches as needed, and were rarely consistent. In such cases, the shade provides information about when the stamp was made, and possibly even identify a particular printing. Extreme variations may be considered [[color error]]s; for instance, the 4c value of the US [[Columbian Issue]] of 1893 was normally printed in [[ultramarine]], but a handful were printed in blue, a shade with distinctly more green; these are worth in the US$10,000 range instead of the usual $10.

Inks may also be diluted or applied more thinly, as for instance the World War I stamps of [[Germany]] and World War II stamps of the [[United Kingdom]]. It can also happen randomly, if a printing plate is accidentally under-inked.

Ultraviolet light is destructive to a great many pigments, and can cause considerable lightening. In addition, some countries have used water-soluble materials known as [[fugitive (pigment)|fugitive]] inks to prevent [[postage stamp reuse]]. Stamps of this type may be much lighter in color after being soaked.

Some dramatic color variations occur as a result of chemical action; such stamps are called [[color changeling]]s. Examples include [[sulfuretting]] (often misnamed "oxidation"), a reaction involving lead that may turn a blue or green stamp to black, and the effects of salt water, famously seen in stamps of [[New South Wales]] recovered from the wreck of the ''[[Colombo (ship)|Colombo]]''. Forgers have also used chemicals to try to produce seeming rarities, although by now experts know how to identify these attempts.

== Nomenclature ==
In general, collectors follow the [[stamp catalog]]s in matters of color nomenclature, even though the different catalogs are not consistent with each other. Although there are a great many named colors, the selection used by philatelists is limited to several dozen, modified by adjectives such as "dark", "light", "pale", "bright" and "deep". In addition, two color names may be combined, as in "gray green" or "brown orange", where the first name indicates the direction of modification to the second color. Thus "brown orange" is a duller and darker orange, while "orange brown" has a tinge to it that is more orange than would be seen with a "yellow brown" or "red brown". This system becomes less clear when extended to other colors, and few collectors could describe precisely how "carmine rose" is different from "rose carmine". Certain colors such as "lake", a shade of red which often commands a price premium, have a traditional, but somewhat uncertain, meaning which differs from general usage of "lake" in terms of pigments and dyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neyhart|first=Charles|title=What's up with the color "lake?"|journal=Book Reports|date=March–April 2011|url=http://www.nwpl.org/documents/NPLBookReportsmarch-april2011.pdf|accessdate=May 12, 2011|page=10|publisher=[[Northwest Philatelic Library]]|location=Portland, Oregon|quote=The philatelic usage of the word is to describe a shade of red. Color science, on the other hand, is very specific about lakes, which include many hues, for example, blues and yellows.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, government-issued official descriptions merely gave out a primary name such as "red" for a whole range of shades. In more recent years, the descriptions have become more precise, such as "dark sage green", though not necessarily enlightening collectors any more than previously.

{{Punctuation marks|.|caption=Punctuation marks}}
'''Punctuation''' (formerly sometimes called '''pointing''') is the use of spacing, conventional signs and certain typographical devices as aids to the understanding and correct reading of handwritten and printed text whether read silently or aloud.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/483473/punctuation "Punctuation].&lt;/ref&gt; Another description is, "It is the practice action or system of inserting points or other small marks into texts in order to aid interpretation; division of text into sentences, clauses, etc., by means of such marks."&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', definition 2a.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In written [[Standard written English|English]], punctuation is vital to disambiguate the meaning of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s. For example: "woman, without her man, is nothing" (emphasizing the importance of men), and "woman: without her, man is nothing" (emphasizing the importance of women) have very different meanings; as do "eats shoots and leaves" (which means the subject consumes plant growths) and "eats, shoots, and leaves" (which means the subject eats first, then fires a weapon, and then leaves the scene).&lt;ref name=Truss&gt;[[Lynne Truss|Truss, Lynne]] (2003). ''[[Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation]]''. Profile Books. {{ISBN|1-86197-612-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sharp differences in meaning are produced by the simple differences in punctuation within the example pairs, especially the latter.

The rules of punctuation vary with language, [[Location (geography)|location]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] and [[time]] and are constantly evolving. Certain aspects of punctuation are stylistic and are thus the [[author|author's]] (or [[copy editing|editor's]]) choice, or [[tachygraphy|tachygraphic]] language forms, such as those used in [[online chat]] and [[Text messaging|text messages]].

==History==
The first writing systems were either [[Logogram|logographic]] or [[Syllabary|syllabic]]{{mdash}}for example, [[Written Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Mayan script]]{{mdash}}which do not necessarily require punctuation, especially spacing. This is because the entire [[morpheme]] or word is typically clustered within a single glyph, so spacing does not help as much to distinguish where one word ends and the other starts. Disambiguation and emphasis can easily be communicated without punctuation by employing a separate written form distinct from the spoken form of the language that uses slightly different phraseology. Even today, written English differs subtly from spoken English because not all emphasis and disambiguation is possible to convey in print, even with punctuation.

Ancient Chinese classical texts were transmitted without punctuation. However, many [[Warring States period]] bamboo texts contain the symbols {{angbr|└}} and {{angbr|▄}} indicating the end of a chapter and full stop, respectively.&lt;ref name="Warring States"&gt;林清源，《簡牘帛書標題格式研究》台北： 藝文印書館，2006。(Lin Qingyuan, ''Study of Title Formatting in Bamboo and Silk Texts'' Taipei: Yiwen Publishing, 2006.) {{ISBN|957-520-111-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Song dynasty]], addition of punctuation to texts by scholars to aid comprehension became common.&lt;ref name="History of the Song Dynasty"&gt;The ''[[History of Song|History of the Song Dynasty]]'' (1346) states 「凡所讀書，無不加標點。」 (Among those who read texts, there are none who do not add punctuation).&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest [[alphabet]]ic writing had no [[capitalization]], no spaces, no vowels and few punctuation marks. This worked as long as the subject matter was restricted to a limited range of topics (e.g., writing used for recording business transactions). Punctuation is historically an aid to reading aloud.

The oldest known document using punctuation is the [[Mesha Stele]] (9th century BC). This employs points between the words and horizontal strokes between the sense section as punctuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=Eugene|title=Q&amp;A: When were punctuation marks first used?|url=http://www.historyextra.com/article/premium/qa-when-were-punctuation-marks-first-used|website=History Extra|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Antiquity===
Most texts were still written in ''[[scriptio continua|scriptura continua]]'', that is without any separation between words. However, the [[Greeks]] were sporadically using punctuation marks consisting of vertically arranged dots—usually two (dicolon) or three (tricolon)—in around the 5th century {{smallcaps|b.c.}} as an aid in the oral delivery of texts. Greek playwrights such as [[Euripides]] and [[Aristophanes]] used symbols to distinguish the ends of phrases in written [[drama]]: this essentially helped the play's cast to know when to pause. After 200 {{smallcaps|b.c.}}, the Greeks used [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]]'s system (called ''théseis'') of a single dot (''punctus'') placed at varying heights to mark up speeches at rhetorical divisions:
* ''hypostigmḗ'' – a low ''punctus'' on the baseline to mark off a ''komma'' (unit smaller than a [[clause]]);
* ''stigmḕ mésē'' – a ''punctus'' at midheight to mark off a clause (''kōlon''); and 
* ''stigmḕ teleía'' – a high ''punctus'' to mark off a sentence (''periodos'').&lt;ref&gt;E. Otha Wingo, ''Latin Punctuation in the Classical Age'' (The Hague, Netherlands: De Gruyter, 1972), 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, the Greeks used the [[paragraphos]] (or [[gamma]]) to mark the beginning of sentences, marginal [[Diple (textual symbol)|diple]]s to mark quotations, and a [[Coronis (textual symbol)|koronis]] to indicate the end of major sections.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (''ca''. 1st century {{smallcaps|b.c.}}) also occasionally used symbols to indicate pauses, but the Greek ''théseis''—under the name ''distinctiones''&lt;ref&gt;The Latin names for the marks: ''subdistinctio'', ''media distinctio'', and ''distinctio''.&lt;/ref&gt;—prevailed by the {{smallcaps|a.d.}} 4th century as reported by [[Aelius Donatus]] and [[Isidore of Seville]] (7th century). Also, texts were sometimes laid out ''per capitula'', where every sentence had its own separate line. Diples were used, but by the late period these often degenerated into comma-shaped marks.

===Medieval===
Punctuation developed dramatically when large numbers of copies of the [[Bible]] started to be produced. These were designed to be read aloud, so the [[copyists]] began to introduce a range of marks to aid the reader, including [[Indentation (typesetting)|indentation]], various punctuation marks ([[Diple (textual symbol)|diple]], [[paragraphos]], ''simplex ductus''), and an early version of initial capitals (''litterae notabiliores''). [[Jerome]] and his colleagues, who made a translation of the Bible into [[Latin]], the ''[[Vulgate]]'' (''ca''. {{smallcaps|a.d.}} 400), employed a layout system based on established practices for teaching the speeches of [[Demosthenes]] and [[Cicero]]. Under his layout ''per cola et commata'' every sense-unit was indented and given its own line. This layout was solely used for biblical manuscripts during the 5th-9th centuries but was abandoned in favor of punctuation.

In the 7th-8th centuries [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] scribes, whose [[native language]]s were not derived from [[Latin]], added more visual cues to render texts more intelligible. Irish scribes introduced the practice of [[Space (punctuation)|word separation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M. B. |last=Parkes |chapter=The Contribution of Insular Scribes of the Seventh and Eighth Centuries to the ‘Grammar of Legibility |title=Scribes, Scripts and Readers: Studies in the Communication, Presentation and Dissemination of Medieval Texts |location=London |publisher=Hambledon Press |date=1991 |pages=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, insular scribes adopted the ''[[distinctiones]]'' system while adapting it for minuscule script (so as to be more prominent) by using not differing height but rather a differing number of marks—aligned horizontally (or sometimes triangularly)—to signify a pause's value: one mark for a minor pause, two for a medium one, and three for a major. Most common were the ''punctus'', a comma-shaped mark, and a 7-shaped mark (''comma positura''), often used in combination. The same marks could be used in the margin to mark off quotations.

In the late 8th century a different system emerged in [[Francia|France]] under the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Originally indicating how the voice should be [[Modulation|modulated]] when chanting the [[liturgy]], the ''positurae'' migrated into any text meant to be read aloud, and then to all manuscripts. ''[[Positurae]]'' first reached [[England]] in the late 10th century probably during the Benedictine reform movement, but was not adopted until after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]]. The original ''positurae'' were the ''punctus'', ''punctus elevatus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paleography: How to Read Medieval Handwriting |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |url= http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic453618.files/Central/editions/paleo.html |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151208074905/http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic453618.files/Central/editions/paleo.html |archive-date= 8 December 2015 |access-date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''punctus versus'', and ''punctus interrogativus'', but a fifth symbol, the ''punctus flexus'', was added in the 10th century to indicate a pause of a value between the ''punctus'' and ''punctus elevatus''. In the late 11th/early 12th century the ''punctus versus'' disappeared and was taken over by the simple ''punctus'' (now with two distinct values).&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Clemens &amp; Timothy Graham, ''Introduction to Manuscript Studies'' (Ithaca–London: Cornell UP, 2007), 84–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[late Middle Ages]] saw the addition of the ''virgula suspensiva'' (slash or slash with a midpoint dot) which was often used in conjunction with the ''punctus'' for different types of pauses. Direct quotations were marked with marginal diples, as in Antiquity, but from at least the 12th century scribes also began entering diples (sometimes double) within the column of text.

===Printing-press era===
{{anchor|Later developments|reason=Old section name; might be linked-to.}}
The amount of printed material and its readership began to increase after the invention of moveable type in Europe in the 1450s. As explained by writer and editor [[Lynne Truss]], "The rise of printing in the 14th and 15th centuries meant that a standard system of punctuation was urgently required."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation|last= Truss|first= Lynne|year= 2004|publisher= Gotham Books|location= New York|isbn= 1-59240-087-6|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of a standard system of punctuation has also been attributed to the Venetian printers [[Aldus Manutius]] and his grandson. They have been credited with popularizing the practice of ending sentences with the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] or [[full stop]], inventing the [[semicolon]], making occasional use of [[Bracket#Parentheses .28 .29|parentheses]] and creating the modern [[Comma (punctuation)|comma]] by lowering the virgule. By 1566, Aldus Manutius the Younger was able to state that the main object of punctuation was the clarification of [[syntax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation|last= Truss|first= Lynn|year= 2004|publisher= Gotham Books|location= New York|isbn= 1-59240-087-6|pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, punctuation in the western world had evolved "to classify the marks hierarchically, in terms of weight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation|last= Truss|first= Lynn|year= 2004|publisher= Gotham Books|location= New York|isbn= 1-59240-087-6|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cecil Hartley's poem identifies their relative values:

&lt;poem style=margin:4em;&gt;
The stop point out, with truth, the time of pause
A sentence doth require at ev'ry clause.
At ev'ry comma, stop while ''one'' you count;
At semicolon, ''two'' is the amount;
A colon doth require the time of ''three'';
The period ''four'', as learned men agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation|last= Truss|first= Lynn|year= 2004|publisher= Gotham Books|location= New York|isbn= 1-59240-087-6|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

The use of punctuation was not standardised until after the invention of printing. According to the 1885 edition of ''The American Printer'', the importance of punctuation was noted in various sayings by children such as:

&lt;poem style=margin:4em;&gt;
[[Charles I of England|Charles the First]] walked and talked
Half an hour after his head was cut off.
&lt;/poem&gt;

With a semi-colon and a comma added it reads:

&lt;poem style=margin:4em;&gt;
Charles the First walked and talked;
Half an hour after, his head was cut off.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iona and Peter Opie]] (1943) ''I Saw Esau''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

In a 19th-century manual of [[typography]], Thomas MacKellar writes:
{{quote|Shortly after the invention of printing, the necessity of stops or pauses in sentences for the guidance of the reader produced the colon and full point. In process of time, the comma was added, which was then merely a perpendicular line, proportioned to the body of the letter. These three points were the only ones used until the close of the fifteenth century, when Aldo Manuccio gave a better shape to the comma, and added the semicolon; the comma denoting the shortest pause, the semicolon next, then the colon, and the full point terminating the sentence. The marks of interrogation and admiration were introduced many years after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The American Printer: A Manual of Typography, Containing Practical Directions for Managing all Departments of a Printing Office, As Well as Complete Instructions for Apprentices: With Several Useful Tables, Numerous Schemes for Imposing Forms in Every Variety, Hints to Authors, Etc.|edition= Fifteenth – Revised and Enlarged|last= MacKellar|first= Thomas|year= 1885|publisher= MacKellar, Smiths &amp; Jordan|location= Philadelphia|page=63}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Typewriters and electronic communication===

The introduction of [[electrical telegraphy]] with a limited set of transmission codes&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [[Morse code]] and [[]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[typewriter]]s with a limited set of keys influenced punctuation subtly.  For example, [[curved quotes]] and [[apostrophe]]s were all collapsed into two characters (' and ").  The [[hyphen]], [[minus sign]], and dashes of various widths were collapsed into a single character (-, sometimes repeated as -- to represent a long dash).  The [[Space (punctuation)|spaces]] of different widths available to professional typesetters were generally replaced by a single full-character width space, with typefaces [[monospace]]d.  In some cases a typewriter keyboard did not include an exclamation point (!) but this was constructed by the [[overstrike]] of an apostrophe and a period; the original [[Morse code]] did not represent an exclamation point at all.

These simplifications were carried forward into digital writing, with [[teleprinter]]s and the [[ASCII]] character set essentially supporting the same characters as typewriters.  Treatment of whitespace in [[HTML]] discouraged the practice (in English prose) of putting two full spaces after a full stop, since a single or double space would appear the same on the screen.  (Some style guides now discourage double spaces, and some electronic writing tools automatically collapse double spaces to single.)  The full traditional set of typesetting tools became available with the advent of [[desktop publishing]] and more sophisticated [[word processor]]s.  Despite the widespread adoption of character sets like [[Unicode]] that support traditionally typeset punctuation, writing forms like [[text messages]] tend to use the simplified ASCII style of punctuation, with the addition of new non-text characters like [[emoji]].  Informal [[text speak]] tends to drop punctuation when not needed, including some ways that would be considered errors in more formal writing.

In the computer era, punctuation characters were recycled for use in [[programming languages]] and data representation as in [[URL]]s.  Due to its use in [[email]] and [[Twitter]] handles, the [[at sign]] went from an obscure character mostly used by grocers (and not professional typesetters) to a very common character in common use for both technical routing and an abbreviation for "at".

==In English==
{{main|Punctuation of English|Quotation mark}}
There are two major styles of punctuation in English: British or American. These two styles differ mainly in the way in which they handle quotation marks, particularly in conjunction with other punctuation marks. In British English, punctuation such as periods and commas are placed outside the closing quotation mark; in American English, however, punctuation is placed inside the closing quotation mark. This rule varies for other punctuation marks; for example, American English follows the British English rule when it comes to semicolons, colons, question marks, and exclamation points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chelsea|first1=Lee|title=Punctuating Around Quotation Marks|url=http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html|website=APA Style|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other languages==
{{hatnote|"Punctuation in French" redirects here. See also {{section link|French orthography#Punctuation}}.}}

Other [[languages of Europe]] use much the same punctuation as English. The similarity is so strong that the few variations may confuse a native English reader. [[Quotation mark]]s are particularly variable across European languages. For example, in [[French language|French]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], quotes would appear as: {{lang|fr|«&amp;thinsp;Je suis fatigué.&amp;thinsp;»}} (in French, each "double punctuation", as the [[guillemet]], requires a [[non-breaking space]]; in Russian it does not).

In [[French language|French]] of [[France]], the signs ''':''' ''';''' '''?''' and '''!''' are always preceded by a thin unbreakable space. In [[Canada]], this is only the case for ''':'''.

In [[Greek language|Greek]], the question mark is written as the English semicolon, while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point {{angbr|·}}, known as the {{lang|el-Latn|[[interpunct#Ano teleia|ano teleia]]}} ({{lang|grc|άνω τελεία}}).

In [[Georgian language|Georgian]], three dots, {{angbr|[[wikt:჻|჻]]}}, were formerly used as a sentence or paragraph divider. It is still sometimes used in calligraphy.

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] uses an inverted question mark {{angbr|[[¿]]}} at the beginning of a question and the normal question mark at the end, as well as an inverted exclamation mark {{angbr|[[¡]]}} at the beginning of an exclamation and the normal exclamation mark at the end.

[[Armenian language|Armenian]] uses several punctuation marks of its own. The full stop is represented by a colon, and vice versa; the exclamation mark is represented by a diagonal similar to a tilde {{angbr|~}}, while the question mark {{angbr|՞}} resembles an unclosed circle placed after the last vowel of the word.

[[Arabic]], [[Urdu]], and [[Persian language|Persian]]—written from right to left—use a reversed question mark: {{angbr|؟}}, and a reversed comma: {{angbr|،}}. This is a modern innovation; pre-modern Arabic did not use punctuation. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], which is also written from right to left, uses the same characters as in English, {{angbr|,}} and {{angbr|?}}.

Originally, [[Sanskrit]] had no punctuation. In the 17th century, Sanskrit and [[Marathi language|Marathi]], both written using [[Devanagari]], started using the vertical bar {{angbr|[[Danda|।]]}} to end a line of prose and double vertical bars {{angbr|॥}} in verse.

Punctuation was not used in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]] writing until the adoption of punctuation from the West in the late 19th and early 20th century. In unpunctuated texts, the grammatical structure of sentences in classical writing is inferred from context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=English Grammar and Usage |last=Prasoon |first=Shrikant |publisher=V &amp; S Publishers |year=2015 |isbn=978-93-505742-6-3 |location=New Delhi |pages=Chapter 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most punctuation marks in modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean have similar functions to their English counterparts; however, they often look different and have different customary rules.

In the [[Indian subcontinent]], {{angbr|:-}} is sometimes used in place of colon or after a subheading. Its origin is unclear, but could be a remnant of the [[British Raj]]. Another punctuation common in the Indian Subcontinent for writing monetary amounts is the use of {{angbr|/-}} or {{angbr|/=}} after the number. For example, Rs. 20/- or Rs. 20/= implies 20 rupees whole.

[[Thai language|Thai]] did not use punctuation until the adoption of punctuation from the West in the 20th century. Blank spaces are more frequent than full stops or commas.

==Novel punctuation marks==
==="Love point" and similar marks===
In 1966, the French author [[Hervé Bazin]] proposed a series of six innovative punctuation marks in his book ''Plumons l'Oiseau'' ("Let's pluck the bird", 1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bazin|first=Hervé|title=Plumons l’oiseau|publisher=Éditions Bernard Grasset|publication-place=Paris (France)|year=1966|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n4256.pdf Revised preliminary proposal to encode six punctuation characters introduced by Hervé Bazin in the UCS] by Mykyta Yevstifeyev and Karl Pentzlin, Feb. 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Question comma", "exclamation comma"===
An international [[patent application]] was filed, and published in 1992 under [[Work order|Work Order (WO)]] number WO9219458,&lt;ref&gt;[http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=WO9219458 European Patent Office publication]&lt;/ref&gt; for two new punctuation marks: the "question comma" and the "exclamation comma". The ''question comma'' has a comma instead of the dot at the bottom of a question mark, while the ''exclamation comma'' has a comma in place of the point at the bottom of an exclamation mark. These were intended for use as question and exclamation marks within a sentence, a function for which normal question and exclamation marks can also be used, but which may be considered obsolescent. The patent application entered into the national phase only in Canada. It was advertised as lapsing in Australia on 27 January 1994&lt;ref&gt;Australian Official Journal of Patents, 27 January 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and in Canada on 6 November 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patents.ic.gc.ca/cipo/cpd/en/patent/2102803/financial_transactions.html CIPO – Patent – 2102803 – Financial Transactions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002113219/http://patents.ic.gc.ca/cipo/cpd/en/patent/2102803/financial_transactions.html |date=2 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computing==
Various sets of characters are referred to as "punctuation" in certain computing situations, many of which are also used to punctuate natural languages. Sometimes non-punctuation in the natural language sense (such as "&amp;" which is not punctuation but is an abbreviation for "and") are included.

[[General Punctuation (Unicode block)|General Punctuation]] and [[Supplemental Punctuation]] are blocks of [[Unicode symbols]].

In [[regular expression]]s, the character class &lt;code&gt;[:punct:]&lt;/code&gt; is defined to consist of the following characters (when operating in [[ASCII]] mode): &lt;code&gt;[][!"#$%&amp;'()*+,./:;&lt;=&gt;?@\^_`{|}~-]&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2248">'''Rough consensus''' is a term used in [[consensus decision-making]] to indicate the "sense of the group" concerning a particular matter under consideration.  It has been defined as the "dominant view" of a group as determined by its [[chairperson]].  The term was first used by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) in describing its procedures for [[working group]]s (WGs).  

The means to establish rough consensus was described by the IETF as follows:&lt;ref&gt;RFC 2418 - IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Working groups make decisions through a "rough consensus" process.  IETF consensus does not require that all participants agree although this is, of course, preferred.  In general, the dominant view of the working group shall prevail.  (However, "dominance" is not to be determined on the basis of volume or persistence, but rather a more general sense of agreement). Consensus can be determined by a show of hands, humming, or any other means on which the WG agrees (by rough consensus, of course).  Note that 51% of the working group does not qualify as "rough consensus" and 99% is better than rough.  It is up to the Chair to determine if rough consensus has been reached (IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase is often extended into the saying "rough consensus and running code",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ietf.org/tao.html The Tao of IETF: A Novice's Guide to the Internet Engineering Task Force]&lt;/ref&gt; to make it clear that the IETF is interested in practical, working systems that can be quickly implemented.  There is some debate as to whether running code leads to rough consensus or vice versa.

There is also caution about whether percentages are a good measure for rough consensus.  The IETF published a subsequent document pointing out that supporting percentage is less important for determining "rough consensus" than ensuring opposing views are addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282|title=RFC 7282: On Consensus and Humming in the IETF|last=Resnick|first=Pete|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[phrase]] '''"Smoke 'em if you got 'em"''' or "Smoke if you got 'em" is [[slang]] for "do what you want, if you have the means". The first phrase was popular in the United States [[military]] during [[World War II]], meaning to take a break. Officers would say "Smoke 'em if you got 'em", allowing the soldiers to take a break and smoke their [[cigarette]]s,  "if you got' em" referring to the vagaries of war. Cigarettes were nearly impossible to get in Europe during that time because of the deprivations of the war. Along with nylon stockings for women, cigarettes were a luxury item that took on cultural importance beyond their monetary value. Soldiers got a daily allotment of cigarettes with their [[k-ration|K ration]], the 1940s [[combat ration]] equivalent of modern [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|Meals, Ready-to-Eat]] (MREs).  Not all soldiers smoked, and unsmoked cigarettes became a War Department currency. The soldiers traded freely across all borders and social classes.  Seventy-five years later, the phrase was a touchstone used in all media to evoke a former heroic period. &lt;ref&gt;Vic Morrow - ''Combattes ber!'' ABC television series October 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tiipai''' ('''Tipay''') is a Native American language spoken by a number of [[Kumeyaay]] (Kumiai) tribes in northern [[Baja California]] and southern [[San Diego County]], [[California]]. It is also known as Southern Diegueño. [[Leanne Hinton|Hinton]] (1994:28) provided a "conservative estimate" of 200 Tipai speakers in the early 1990s; the number of speakers has declined steadily since that time.

Tipai belongs to the [[Yuman languages|Yuman language family]] and to the Delta–California branch of that family.  In the past, Tipai and its neighbors to the north, [[Kumeyaay language|Kumeyaay]] and [[Ipai language|Ipai]], have been considered dialects of a single [[Diegueño]] language, but linguists now recognize that they represent at least three distinct languages (for discussion, see [[Margaret Langdon|Langdon]] 1990). Tipai itself is not a uniform speech variety, and some suggest that it might be possible to recognize multiple languages within Tipai ([[Don Laylander|Laylander]] 1985:33; [[Marianne Mithun|Mithun]] 1999:577).

Published documentation of the Tipai language includes a descriptive grammar (Miller 2001), a comparative dictionary (Miller and Langdon 2008), a word list (Meza and Meyer 2008), and texts (Hinton 1976, Hinton 1978, see also Miller 2001:331-348).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9629">In [[computational linguistics]], '''word-sense induction''' (WSI) or '''discrimination''' is an [[open problem]] of [[natural language processing]], which concerns the automatic identification of the [[word sense|senses]] of a [[word]] (i.e. [[meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]). Given that the output of word-sense induction is a set of senses for the target word (sense inventory), this task is strictly related to that of [[word-sense disambiguation]] (WSD), which relies on a predefined sense inventory and aims to solve the [[polysemy|ambiguity]] of words in context.

==Approaches and methods==

The output of a word-sense induction algorithm is a [[cluster analysis|clustering]] of contexts in which the target word occurs or a clustering of words related to the target word. Three main methods have been proposed in the literature:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = R. | last = Navigli | url = http://www.dsi.uniroma1.it/~navigli/pubs/ACM_Survey_2009_Navigli.pdf | title = Word Sense Disambiguation: A Survey | journal = ACM Computing Surveys | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | date = 2009 | pages = 1–69 | doi=10.1145/1459352.1459355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = M. | last = Nasiruddin | date = 2013 | url = http://www.taln2013.org/actes/www/RECITAL-2013/actes/recital-2013-long-015.pdf | title = A State of the Art of Word Sense Induction: A Way Towards Word Sense Disambiguation for Under-Resourced Languages | conference = TALN-RÉCITAL 2013 | location = Les Sables d'Olonne, France | pages = 192–205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Context clustering
* Word clustering
* Co-occurrence graphs

=== Context clustering ===

The underlying hypothesis of this approach is that, words are semantically similar if they appear in similar documents, with in similar context windows, or in similar syntactic contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | first = T. | last = Van de Cruys | date = 2010 | url = http://www.timvandecruys.be/media/papers/VandeCruys2010Mining.pdf | title = Mining for Meaning. The Extraction of Lexico-Semantic Knowledge from Text }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each occurrence of a target word in a corpus is represented as a context [[Euclidean vector|vector]]. These context vectors can be either first-order vectors, which directly represent the context at hand, or second-order vectors, i.e., the contexts of the target word are similar if their words tend to co-occur together. The vectors are then clustered into groups, each identifying a sense of the target word. A well-known approach to context clustering is the Context-group Discrimination algorithm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = H. | last = Schütze | date = 1998 | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=236684 | title = Dimensions of meaning | conference = 1992 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing | publisher = IEEE Computer Society Press | location = Los Alamitos, CA | pages = 787–796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on large matrix computation methods.

=== Word clustering ===

Word clustering is a different approach to the induction of word senses. It consists of clustering words, which are semantically similar and can thus bear a specific meaning. Lin’s algorithm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = D. | last = Lin | url = http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/P/P98/P98-2127.pdf | title = Automatic retrieval and clustering of similar words | conference = 17th International Conference on Computational linguistics (COLING) | location = Montreal, Canada | date = 1998 | pages = 768–774 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a prototypical example of word clustering, which is based on syntactic dependency statistics, which occur in a corpus to produce sets of words for each discovered sense of a target word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | last1 = Van de Cruys | first1 = Tim | last2 = Apidianaki | first2 = Marianna | date = 2011 | url = http://www.timvandecruys.be/media/papers/VandeCruysApidianaki2011Latent.pdf | title = Latent Semantic Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clustering By Committee (CBC) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = D. | last1 = Lin | first2 = P. | last2 = Pantel | title = Discovering word senses from text | citeseerx = 10.1.1.12.6771 | conference = 8th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) | location = Edmonton, Canada | date = 2002 | pages = 613–619 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also uses syntactic contexts, but exploits a similarity matrix to encode the similarities between words and relies on the notion of committees to output different senses of the word of interest. These approaches are hard to obtain on a large scale for many domain and languages.

=== Co-occurrence graphs ===

The main hypothesis of co-occurrence graphs assumes that the semantics of a word can be represented by means of a co-occurrence [[graph (computer science)|graph]], whose vertices are co-occurrences and edges are co-occurrence relations. These approaches are related to word clustering methods, where co-occurrences between words can be obtained on the basis of grammatical &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = D. | last1 = Widdows | first2 = B. | last2 = Dorow | url = http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/C/C02/C02-1114.pdf | title = A graph model for unsupervised lexical acquisition | conference = 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING) | location = Taipei, Taiwan |date = 2002 | pages = 1–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or collocational relations.&lt;ref name=veronis04&gt;{{cite journal | first = J. | last = Véronis | url = http://sites.univ-provence.fr/veronis/pdf/2004-hyperlex-CSL.pdf | title = Hyperlex: Lexical cartography for information retrieval | journal = Computer Speech and Language | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | date = 2004 | pages = 223–252 | doi=10.1016/j.csl.2004.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; HyperLex is the successful approaches of a graph algorithm, based on the identification of hubs in co-occurrence graphs, which have to cope with the need to tune a large number of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = E. | last1 = Agirre | first2 = D. | last2 = Martinez | first3 = O. Lopez | last3 = De Lacalle | first4 = A. | last4 = Soroa | url = http://ixa.si.ehu.es/Ixa/Argitalpenak/Artikuluak/1149260582/publikoak/emnlp.pdf | title = Two graph-based algorithms for state-of-the-art WSD | conference = 2006 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) | location = Sydney, Australia | pages = 585–593 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To deal with this issue several graph-based algorithms have been proposed, which are based on simple graph patterns, namely Curvature Clustering, Squares, Triangles and Diamonds (SquaT++), and Balanced Maximum Spanning Tree Clustering (B-MST).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = A. | last1 = Di Marco | first2 = R. | last2 = Navigli | date = 2013 | url = http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/COLI_a_00148 | title = Clustering and Diversifying Web Search Results with Graph-Based Word Sense Induction | journal = Computational Linguistics | volume = 39 | issue =3 | publisher = MIT Press | pages = 709–754 | doi=10.1162/coli_a_00148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns aim at identifying meanings using the local structural properties of the co-occurrence graph. A randomized algorithm which partitions the graph vertices by iteratively transferring the mainstream message (i.e. word sense) to neighboring vertices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | first = C. | last = Biemann | date = 2006 | url = http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/~cbiemann/pub/2006/BiemannTextGraph06.pdf | title = Chinese Whispers - an Efficient Graph Clustering Algorithm  and its Application to Natural Language Processing Problems }}&lt;/ref&gt; is Chinese Whispers. By applying co-occurrence graphs approaches have been shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in standard evaluation tasks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="144469">'''Yemenite Hebrew''' ({{Lang-he-n|עִבְרִית תֵּימָנִית|rtl=yes}} ''Ivrit Temanit''), also referred to as '''Temani Hebrew''', is the pronunciation system for [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] traditionally used by [[Yemenite Jews]]. Yemenite Jews brought their language to Israel through immigration. Their first organized immigration to the region began in 1882.
[[File:Yemenite elders studying Torah, Ottoman Palestine, 1906–1918.jpg|thumb|right|Yemenite Jewish elders rehearsing oral lessons (1906–1918)]]
Yemenite Hebrew has been studied by language scholars, many of whom believe it to retain older phonetic and grammatical features lost elsewhere.{{nbsp}}&lt;ref&gt;''Judaeo-Yemenite Studies - Proceedings of the Second International Congress'', Ephraim Isaac &amp; Yosef Tobi (ed.), Introduction, Princeton University 1999, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Yemenite speakers of Hebrew have garnered considerable praise from language purists because of their use of grammatical features from classical Hebrew. Tunisian rabbi and scholar, Rabbi [[Meir Mazuz]], once said of Yemenites that they are good grammarians.&lt;ref&gt;''Responsa Yitzhak Yeranen'', part iv, Bnei Barak 1991, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21373&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=80&amp;hilite= page 80], by Rabbi Hayim Yitzhak Barda, who quotes R. Meir Mazuz, saying: "The Yemenites are very stringent and well-versed, and are punctilious in their [usage of the] language, and they support the enunciation of the Ashkenazim" (translated from the Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by some scholars that its [[phonology]] was heavily influenced by spoken [[Yemeni Arabic]] {{citation needed|reason= Which scholars?|date=November 2015}}. Other scholars and rabbis, including [[Rabbi]] [[Yosef Qafih]] and Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], hold the view that Yemenite Hebrew was not influenced by Yemenite Arabic, as this type of Arabic was also spoken by Yemenite Jews and is distinct from the liturgical Hebrew and the conversational Hebrew of the communities.&lt;ref&gt;Rav Kook's Orah Mishpat question regarding Kiryat Sh'ma "וביחוד למי שמשנה ממבטא התימני המוחזק אצלם מדורות הראשונים שהוא המדויק שבמבטאים כמפורסם שבודאי אסור לעשות כן".&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, Rabbi Qafih notes that the Yemenite Jews spoke Arabic with a distinct Jewish flavor, inclusive of pronouncing many Arabic words with vowels foreign to the Arabic language, e.g., the [[Kamatz|Qamats]] ({{nbsp}}{{lang-he-n|קָמַץ|rtl=yes}}) and [[Tzere|Tseri]] ({{lang-he-n|צֵירִי|rtl=yes}}{{lrm}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-he-n|rtl=yes|"מסורות הגייה ושליטת העברית בקרב יהודי תימן"}} in Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]]'s ''Collected Papers'', volume 2, pages 943-946 (Hebrew). Following is a relevant portion thereof: {{lang-he-n|טענה זו אמנם אפשרית באופן תיאורי ואפשר להשליכה לא רק כאן אלא גם בכל מקום אחר, אלא שהיא מצד מהותה טענה מאוד תלוּשה וזקוּקה היא לבסיס כל שהוּא שתחול עליו, אחרת, הרי היא נשארת מרחפת ללא תנוחה ודינה להתנדף ולהעלם, כי כל ממש אין בה. כל שכן כאשר אנו מוצאים כדמות ראיה לאידך גיסא, כלומר, במצאנו בניב העברית של יהוּדי תימן דבר שאינו בשפת הסביבה, יש בכך משוּם הוכחה שמסורת זו שמרה על כלילוּתה וסגוּלותיה הייחוּדית.
ננסה להדגים בשני מישורים, במישור הסימניות, כלומר, האותות, ובמישור התנוּעות. האות פ הדגוּשה, הברה זו אינה מצוּיה בשפה הערבית ואין דוברי הערבית מסכּינים לבטאה, וכאשר מזדמנת להם אות זו במלים משפה זרה, מחליפים אותה באות ב. ואילוּ היהוּדים מבטאים אותה בקלוּת ומבחינים היטב בינה לבין כל הברה אחרת הדומה לה, כדרך שהם מבחינים היטב בשאר כל אותות בגד כפת הדגוּשות והרפוּיות. שניה לה האות ב הרפוּיה. גם הברה זו אינה מצוּיה בשפה הערבית ויהוּדי תימן מבטאים אותה בקלוּת וּללא כל מאמץ, ואילוּ הערבים כאשר מזוּמנת להם הברה זו בציטוט משפה זרה מבטאים אותה כאות פ הרפוּיה המצוּיה בלשונם — כי לא הסכּינוּ לה. שתי אלה ודומיהם שׂמים לאַל לדעתי את הטענה, כי הבחנת יהוּדי תימן בין ג רפוּיה ודגוּשה באה להם מן הערבית, למרות שבעלי טענה זו אין להם תחליף ייחוּדי להברות אלה, כי אילוּ היה ממש בטענת ההשפּעה הערבית, איכה נשתמרוּ להם ליהודי תימן הברות עבריות יחוּדיות אלה, אמור מעתה מציאוּתם של הברות בלעדיות כגון אלה מקשים ומכבידים על תחוּלתה של טענת ההשפּעה הזרה.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the pronunciation of Yemenite Hebrew was not only uninfluenced by Arabic, but it influenced the pronunciation of Arabic by those Jews, despite the Jewish presence in Yemen for over a millennium.

Among the dialects of Hebrew preserved into modern times, Yemenite Hebrew is regarded as one of the forms that retains very many features of Hebrew as used in ancient times, particularly [[Tiberian Hebrew]] and [[Mishnaic Hebrew]]. This perception is motivated in part by the fact that Yemenite Hebrew preserves many consonant sounds represented by individual letters in the [[Hebrew alphabet]] that have been lost elsewhere - except for ''sāmeḵ'' ({{Lang-he-n|ס}}) and ''śīn'' ({{Lang-he-n|שׂ}}{{lrm}}), which are both pronounced {{IPA|/s/}},&lt;ref&gt;S. Morag, 'Pronunciations of Hebrew', Encyclopaedia Judaica XIII, 1120-1145&lt;/ref&gt; but which had already merged in ancient times, as evident in the spelling variants in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisha Qimron, The Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Harvard Semitic Studies 29, 1986:29. However, the precise pronunciation of the phoneme /s/ in the Dead Sea Scrolls requires a reexamination of Hebrew, Punic, and Greek.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Baladi-rite Prayer]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
Yemenite Hebrew may have been derived from, or influenced by, the Hebrew of the [[Geonim|Geonic era]] [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Babylonian Jews]]: the oldest Yemenite manuscripts use the [[Babylonian vocalization|Babylonian]] system of vowel symbols, which is believed to antedate the [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian vowel system]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Targum of Isaiah'' – with supralinear punctuation (ed. J.F. Stenning), Oxford 1949, Introduction (pp. ix–x)&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 937 CE, [[Jacob Qirqisani|Qirqisāni]] wrote: “The biblical readings which are wide-spread in Yemen are in the Babylonian tradition."&lt;ref&gt;''Shivtiel Book – Studies in the Hebrew Language and in the Linguistic Traditions of the Jewish Communities'' (ed. Isaac Gluska &amp; Tsemaḥ Kessar), Tel-Aviv 1992, p. 239 (in article by Yehuda Ratzaby who quotes from ''Kitāb al-Ānwār'', ed. Leon Nemoy (edition 30), New York 1939, p. 135).&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in many respects, such as the assimilation of ''[[Patach|paṯaḥ]]'' and ''[[Segol|səġūl]]'', the current Yemenite pronunciation fits the Babylonian notation better than the Tiberian (though the Babylonian notation does not reflect the approximation between ''holam'' and ''sere'' in some Yemenite dialects). This is because in the Babylonian tradition of vocalization there is no distinct symbol for the ''səġūl''.&lt;ref name="Siddur Tefillat Kol Pe 1960, p. 11"/&gt; It does not follow, as claimed by some scholars, that the pronunciation of the two communities was identical, any more than the pronunciation of Sephardim and Ashkenazim is the same because both use the Tiberian symbols. [[File:Babylonian Supralinear Punctuation, from Yemenite Siddur, April 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Section of Yemenite Siddur, with [[Babylonian supralinear punctuation]] (Pirke Avot)]]

The following chart shows the seven vowel paradigms found in the [[Babylonian vocalization|Babylonian supralinear punctuation]], which are reflected to this day by the Yemenite pronunciation of Biblical lections and liturgies, though they now use the Tiberian symbols. For example, there is no separate symbol for the Tiberian ''səġūl'' and the ''pataḥ'' and amongst Yemenites they have the same phonetic sound.&lt;ref&gt;Shelomo Morag, ''Ha-Ivrit she-be-fi Yehude Teman'' (Hebrew as pronounced by Yemenite Jews), Academy of the Hebrew Language: Jerusalem 1963, pp. 92-99; 119-120 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted in this connection that the Babylonian vowel signs remained in use in Yemen long after the Babylonian Biblical tradition had been abandoned, almost until our own time.&lt;ref&gt;Shelomo Morag, ''The Traditions of Hebrew and Aramaic of the Jews of Yemen'', in article: ''Notes on the Vowel System of Babylonian Aramaic as Preserved in the Yemenite Tradition'', Tel-Aviv 2001, p. 197 (end of note 1) {{ISBN|965-7247-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Tiberian&lt;br /&gt;equivalent
|[[Kamatz|qamaṣ]]&lt;ref&gt;The Yemenite pronunciation of this vowel is like the [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazic]] pronunciation thereof or like the ''ḥolam'' in the [[Sephardi Hebrew|Sefardic]] pronunciation (Yosef Qafih, ''Collected Papers'' volume 2, page 931). According to an ancient [[Judeo-Arabic]] work on Hebrew grammar, ''Maḥberet Ha-Tīğān'', the sound of the ''qamaṣ'' is made by "clinching the mouth and holding it." See: ''Maḥberet Kitrei Ha-Torah'' (ed. Yoav Pinhas Halevi), chapter 5, Benei Barak 1990, p. 19 (Hebrew). In the Babylonian supralinear punctuation there is no separate symbol for the ''shĕwā qamaṣ''; rather, the one symbol as shown here is used for both the ''qamaṣ'' and the ''shĕwā qamaṣ'' (''ḥataf qamaṣ'').&lt;/ref&gt;
|[[Patach|paṯaḥ]], ([[Segol|səġūl]])
|[[Tzere|ṣerê]]&lt;ref&gt;The Yemenite pronunciation of this vowel is like the [[Sephardi Hebrew|Sephardic]] pronunciation thereof (Yosef Qafih, ''Collected Papers'' volume 2, page 931 "צֵירִי, כבמבטא הספרדי"); it lacks an exact English equivalent.&lt;/ref&gt;
|[[Shva|shewā]] mobile&lt;br /&gt;(šĕwā naʻ)&lt;ref&gt;This symbol is used strictly as a mobile [[Shva|Shewā]] (Heb. &lt;big&gt;שוא נע&lt;/big&gt;), unlike the Shewā quiescens (Heb. &lt;big&gt;שוא נח&lt;/big&gt;) which has no symbol in the Babylonian supralinear punctuation. The mobile Shewā as a symbol is used to differentiate in eight major grammatical entities in Hebrew [[prescriptive linguistics]]. For example, whenever a Shewā appears at the beginning of a word, it renders the vowel a mobile vowel, as in the Hebrew word "floating" (''m'''e'''raḥef'' / {{Hebrew|&lt;big&gt;מְרַחֵף&lt;/big&gt;}}), or as in &lt;big&gt;לְפָנָי&lt;/big&gt; (''l'''e'''fanai'') or &lt;big&gt;שְׁמַע&lt;/big&gt; (''sh'''e'''ma'') {{small|(Deut. 6:4)}}; or whenever a diacritical vertical line known as a ''Ji'ya'' / {{Hebrew|&lt;big&gt;גִּעְיָא&lt;/big&gt;}} (lit. "bleating" or "bellowing") would normally appear next to a Shewā. For example, in the words הַֽמְקַנֵּ֥א אַתָּ֖ה לִ֑י, {{small|(Num. 11:29)}}, the Shewā beneath the Hebrew character ''mim'' becomes a mobile Shewā because of the ''Ga'ya'' (meteg, or small vertical line) beneath the Hebrew character ''he''. In all these cases the Shewā gives an audible sound to the letter, as in a short "a" or short "e", and is not mute. Likewise, whenever a Shewā appears in the middle of a word and the letter has a diacritical point within it (i.e., ''dagesh''), as in the ''pe'' of מִפְּנֵיכֶם {{small|(Lev. 18:24)}}, it too will become a mobile Shewā (''na'' / {{Hebrew|&lt;big&gt;נָע&lt;/big&gt;}}) - with some exceptions, e.g., the word אֶתּרוֹג according to the Yemenite tradition - as will a word that has two Shewā's written one after the other, as in the word רַעְמְסֵס {{small|(Exo. 12:37)}}, or in the word ּוַיִּשְׁמְעו {{small|(Gen. 3:8)}}, etc. the first Shewā is resting (mute), while the second Shewā is a mobile Shewā. Another instance of where the ''Shewā'' becomes mobile is when it comes directly after a long vowel sound, such as the long vowel of either ''yod'' or ''ḥiraq'', as in &lt;big&gt;יְחִֽידְֿךָ&lt;/big&gt; (Gen. 22:2), giving it the sound of ''yeḥīdh&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;kha'', etc., or as in the long vowel of ''waw'' or ''ḥolam'', as in the words &lt;big&gt;הוֹלְכִֿים&lt;/big&gt;, &lt;big&gt;יוֹדְֿעִים&lt;/big&gt;, &lt;big&gt;מוֹכְֿרִים&lt;/big&gt;, &lt;big&gt;נוֹפְֿלִים&lt;/big&gt;, &lt;big&gt;לוֹמְדִֿים&lt;/big&gt;, and &lt;big&gt;יֹאכְֿלוּ&lt;/big&gt;, etc. (''hōl&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;khīm'', ''yōd&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;ʻīm'', ''mōkh&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;rīm'', ''nōf&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;līm'', ''lōm&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;dhīm'' and ''yōkh&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;lū''), or as in the verse &lt;big&gt;שֹׁפְטִים וְשֹׁטְרִים תִּתֶּן לְךָ&lt;/big&gt; (Deut. 16:18), ''"shōfəṭīm wa-shōṭərīm titen ləkha."''
The symbol is also used in the Babylonian supralinear punctuation to denote a Shewā and Pataḥ that are written together in the Tiberian vowel system, or a Shewā and Segūl that are written together in the Tiberian vowel system, as in the words אֲנִי and אֱמֶת. See: ''Maḥberet Kitrei Ha-Torah'' (ed. Yoav Pinhas Halevi), chapter 5, Benei Barak 1990, pp. 20, 22-23, 31 (Hebrew). See also נקוד, טעמים ומסורת בתימן by Rabbi Yosef Qafih in ''Collected Papers'', volume 2, page 931.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israeli grammarian, [[Shelomo Morag]], has written more extensively about the mobile Shewā, saying: "[In the Babylonian tradition], the sign of the ''[[šĕwā]]'' is used only as an indication of the mobile ''šĕwā'' (Heb. שוא נע), whereas the ''šĕwā'' quiescens (Heb. שוא נח) is not indicated at all. This method is the most common in Yemenite manuscripts which are punctuated in the Babylonian system, and it goes without saying that there is an advantage in it, since it invariably acquaints the reader with the ''šĕwā''’s innate nature, whether it is a ''šĕwā'' quiescens or a mobile ''šĕwā''. Thus, for example, we see that the ''šĕwā'' is mobile in the letter ''mim'' (מ) of the intensive (middle) form of the [active] verb construction, ''piʻel'' (Heb. פִּעֵל), in a word such as 'הַמְּכַבֶּה' [= ‘he that extinguishes’] ([[Mishnah]] ''Shabbat'' 7:2)." Meaning, one sign distinguishes it from the ''šĕwā'' quiescens. See: ''Mishnah - Seder Mo'ed - with a commentary by Maimonides in Arabic, Yemenite MS.'', edited by Yehuda Levi Nahum, Holon 1975, p. 19 (Hebrew); ''The 'šĕwā' in the Traditional Yemenite Pronunciation of Hebrew'', Jerusalem 1957 (Hebrew). Note that the spelling "הַמְּכַבַּה" (with the דגש) is in accordance with the vowelization of Rabbi Yosef 'Amar, in his edition of the Babylonian Talmud vocalized in the Yemenite pronunciation, s.v., Shabbat 29b and 73a; תלמוד בבלי בניקוד תימני, מסכת שבת, דף כט ב ודף עג א. However, "הַמְכַבֶּה אֶת הַנֵּר" (Shabbath 2:5) appears (without the דגש in המכבה) in שיח ירושלם חלק ראשון (fourth edition 5761, p. קכ) and תכלאל שיבת ציון (part 1, 5712, p. קו) alike.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Yemenites, they have preserved the sounds for each of the six double-sounding consonants: ''bəged-kəfet'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''בג"ד כפ"ת'''}}). The following are examples of their peculiar way of pronunciation of these and other letters:
*The phoneme gímel/ğimal ({{Lang-he-n|'''גּ'''}}) with the dāḡēš/dageš is pronounced in the Yemenite Jewish tradition as the English "j" in the word "Jack". Thus, the verse &lt;big&gt;וּמִי, גּוֹי גָּדוֹל&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Deut. 4:8)&lt;/small&gt; is realized as, ''u'mi, ğoi ğaḏol'' ({{IPA-he|u'mi dʒoi dʒaðol|}}) (as in [[Peninsular Arabic]] ج ğīm /d͡ʒ/).&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]] in his commentary on ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'' (2:2) strongly rejected to thar manner of pronunciation for the ''gímel'' with ''dageš'' and thinks it is a mere corruption and that it should be pronounced as a hard "g" as in "go." Rabbi Saadia Gaon's opinion, however, follows the tradition of the Jews and Arabs in his native Egypt, while the Yemenite pronunciation of the ''gímel'' with ''dageš'' follows a custom more closely related to the dialect of Arabic spoken in the land of Israel whenever pronouncing "jeem" ('''ج‍,ج'''), the Arabic equivalent of ''gímel''. See: Yosef Qafih's edition of ''Sefer Yetzirah'', Jerusalem 1972, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''gímel/gimal'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''ג'''}}) without ''dāḡēš/dageš'' is pronounced غ {{IPA|/ɣ/}} like Arabic [[ghain|ġayn]].
*''dāleṯ/dal'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''ד'''}}) without ''dāḡēš/dageš'' is pronounced ذ {{IPA|/ð/}} as the "th" in "this". Thus, the word "one" in ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'' is always pronounced ''aḥāḏ'' ({{IPA-he|æħɔð|}}).&lt;ref&gt;The rules of enunciation when reciting the ''Shema'' is to extend the phonetic sound of the phoneme "daleth" in the word ''eḥaḏ'', which cannot be done unless the phoneme was a "th" sound as in "this," or "that". Cf. Babylonian Talmud, ''Berakhot'' 13b: "Symmachus said: 'Anyone who extends his enunciation of ''eḥaḏ'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''אֶחָדֿ'''}}) [in the recital of the ''Qiryath Shema''], the days and years of his life shall also be extended.' Rav Aha the son of Yaaqov interjected, 'He referred there to the [letter] ''daleth''..."; See Maimonides, [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hil. Qiryath Shema'' 2:9).&lt;/ref&gt;
*The pronunciation of ''tāv/taw'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''ת'''}}) without ''dāḡēš/dageš'' as ث {{IPA|/θ/}} is as the "th" sound in "thick" or "thank" (shared by other [[Mizrahi Hebrew]] dialects such as Iraqi). Thus, ''Sabbath day'' is pronounced in Yemenite Hebrew, ''Yom ha-Shabboth'' ({{IPA-he|yom ha-ʃaboθ|}}).&lt;ref&gt;The "tāv" ''[[raphe]]'' in Ashkenazi traditions is realized as "s", as in ''Shabbos''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Vāv/Waw'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''ו'''}}) is pronounced {{IPA|/w/}} as the English "w" (as also in Iraqi Hebrew and و in Arabic).
*Emphatic and guttural letters have nearly the same sounds and are produced from deep in the throat, as in Arabic.
*The [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]] of ''ḥêṯ/ħet'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''ח'''}}) is equivalent to the Arabic character ح {{IPA|/ħ/}}, with a slight aspirated sound but never like the "ch" in [[Bach]].
*The phoneme ''ʻáyin/зajin'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''ע'''}}) is identical to the Arabic ع {{IPA|/ʕ/}}, and is a [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]]. (The [[Sephardi Hebrew|Sephardic pronunciation]] of ע, however, is of a weaker nature).
*The Hebrew ''tsadi'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''צ'''}}) is not a compound consonant "ts" among the Yemenites, but rather a deep-sounding "s". 
*The Hebrew phoneme /q/ ({{Lang-he-n|'''ק'''}}) (''qof'') is pronounced by the Yemenites (other than the Jews from Shar'ab) as a voiced /g/, as in "go," (as in [[Peninsular Arabic]] ق gāf /g/) and is in keeping with their tradition (assuming it to be correct) that a different phonetic sound is given for ''gímel''/''gimal'' (see ''supra'').
*The phoneme ''resh'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''ר'''}}), or what is also known as the Hebrew rhotic consonant /r/, is pronounced in Yemenite Jewish tradition as an [[alveolar trill]], rather than the uvular trill [ʀ], and is identical to Arabic {{lang|ar|[[ر]]}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|rāʾ}}'' and follows the conventions of old Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]]'s Judeo-Arabic commentary on "[[Sefer Yetzirah|Sefer Hayetzirah]]" (chapter 4, paragraph 3), wherein he describes the phonetic sounds of the 22 characters of the Hebrew alphabet and classifies them in groups based on their individual sounds: "''Aleph'' ({{nbsp}}א), ''hé'' (ה), ''ḥet'' (ח), ''‘ayin'' (ע) are [guttural sounds] produced from the depth of the tongue with the opening of the throat, but ''bet'' (ב), ''waw'' (ו), ''mim'' (מ), ''pé'' (פ) are [labial sounds] made by the release of the lips and the end of the tongue; whereas ''gimal'' (ג), ''yōd'' (י), ''kaf'' (כ), ''qōf'' (ק) are [palatals] separated by the width of the tongue [against the palate] with the [emission of] sound. However, ''daleth'' (ד), ''ṭet'' (ט), ''lamad'' (ל), ''nūn'' (נ), ''tau'' (ת) are [linguals] separated by the mid-section of the tongue with the [emission of] sound; whereas ''zayin'' (ז), ''samakh'' (ס), ''ṣadi'' (צ), ''resh'' (ר), ''shin'' (ש) are [dental sounds] produced between the teeth by a tongue that is at rest."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===
*''Qāmaṣ gāḏôl/Qamac qadol'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ɔː/}}, as in [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]]. The Yemenite pronunciation for ''Qamats gadol'' (קמץ גדול) and ''Qamats qatan'' (קמץ קטן) is identical (see ''infra''.).
*There is no distinction between the vowels ''paṯaḥ/pataħ'' and ''səḡôl/segol'' all being pronounced {{IPA|/æ(ː)/}}, like the Arabic ''fatḥa'' (a feature also found in old Babylonian Hebrew, which used a single symbol for all three).&lt;ref name="Siddur Tefillat Kol Pe 1960, p. 11"&gt;''Siddur Tefillat Kol Pe'', vol. 1 (forward written by Shalom Yitzhak Halevi), Jerusalem 1960, p. 11 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; A ''šəwâ nāʻ/šwa naз'', however, is identical to a חטף פתח and חטף סגול.
*Final ''hê/hej'' with ''mappîq/mefiq'' (a dot in the centre) has an aspirated sound, generally stronger sounding than the regular ''hê/hej''. ''Aleph'' ('''אַלַף''') with a ''dagesh'' (a dot), a rare occurrence, is pronounced with a [[glottal stop]], e.g., the word וַיָּבִיאּוּ in [https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/קטגוריה:בראשית_מג_כו Genesis 43:26].&lt;ref&gt;As is heard in the recording of Aharon Amram's cantillation (mms://media.jvod.info/Nosach/Aharon_Amram/PARACHA/1_10_7_miketz.mp3 [which begins with verse 24]).&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, some words in Hebrew which are written with the final ''hê'' ending (without the ''mappîq'') are realized by a secondary glottal stop and so are abruptly cut short, as to hold one's breath.&lt;ref&gt;Shelomo Morag, ''The Hebrew of the Jews of Yemen'' ({{nbsp}}'''העברית שבפי יהודי תימן'''), Academy of the Hebrew Language: Jerusalem 1963, pp. 4–5 (Hebrew). In two of the examples noted by Shelomo Morag, he shows where the readings for &lt;big&gt;'''תִּפָּדֶה'''&lt;/big&gt; in Isaiah 1:27 and &lt;big&gt;'''וְנֵלְכָה'''&lt;/big&gt; in Isaiah 2:5, are both with an abrupt ending, as in ''tippoːdä{{nbsp}}(ʔ)'' and ''wǝnel&lt;sup&gt;ă&lt;/sup&gt;xoː(ʔ)'' respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A semivocalic sound is heard before ''paṯaḥ gānûḇ/pataħ ganuv'' (''paṯaḥ'' coming between a long vowel and a final guttural): thus ''ruaħ'' (spirit) sounds like ''rúwwaḥ'' and ''sijaħ'' (speech) sounds like ''síyyaḥ''. (That is shared with other Mizrahi pronunciations, such as the [[Syrian Jews#Pronunciation of Hebrew|Syrian]].)

Yemenite pronunciation is not uniform, and Morag has distinguished five sub-dialects, the best known being probably Sana'ani, originally spoken by Jews in and around [[Sana'a]]. Roughly, the points of difference are as follows:
*In some dialects, ''ḥōlem/ħolam'' (long "o" in modern Hebrew) is pronounced {{IPA|/øː/}} (anywhere from [[non-rhotic]] English "er" to German o-[[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]]), but in others, it is pronounced {{IPA|/eː/}} like ''ṣêrệ/cerej''. (The last pronunciation is shared with [[Lithuanian Jews]].)
*Some dialects (e.g. Sharab) do not differentiate between ''bêṯ/bet'' with ''dāḡēš/dageš'' and without it. That occurs most of [[Mizrahi Hebrew]].
*Sana'ani Hebrew primarily places stress on the penultimate syllable,{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} as in Ashkenazi Hebrew.

====''Qamats Gadol'' and ''Qamats Qatan''====
The Yemenites in their reading practices continue the orthographic conventions of the early grammarians, such as Abraham ibn Ezra and Aaron Ben-Asher. One basic rule of grammar states that every word with a long vowel sound, that is, one of either five vowel sounds whose mnemonics are "p'''ī'''t'''ū'''ḥ'''e''' ḥ'''ö'''th'''o'''m" (i.e. ''ḥiraq'', ''šūraq'', ''ṣeré'', ''ḥölam'' and ''qamaṣ''), whenever there is written beside one of these long vowel sounds a ''meteg'' (or what is also called a ''ga’ayah'') and is denoted by a small vertical line below the word (such as shown here &lt;big&gt;זָ&lt;/big&gt;'''{{smallsub|{{pipe}}}}'''&lt;big&gt;כְרוּ&lt;/big&gt;), it indicates that the vowel (in that case, ''qamaṣ'') must be drawn out with a prolonged sound. For example, ōōōōōō, instead of ō, (e.g. ''zoː— kh&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt; ru''). In the Sephardic tradition, however, the practice is different altogether, and they will also alter the phonetic sound of the long vowel ''qamaṣ'' whenever the vowel appears alongside a ''meteg'' (a small vertical line), giving to it the sound of "a", as in ''c'''a'''t'', instead of "ōōōōō." Thus, for the verse in {{Lang-he-n|'''כָּל עַצְמוֹתַי תֹּאמַרְנָה'''}} &lt;small&gt;(Psalm 35:10)&lt;/small&gt;, the Sephardic Jews will pronounce the word &lt;big&gt;כָּל&lt;/big&gt; as "kal" (e.g. ''k'''a'''l ʕaṣmotai'', etc.), instead of ''k'''o'''l ʕaṣmotai'' as pronounced by both Yemenite and Ashkenazi Jewish communities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meir Mazuz]], in article: ''Clarification Regarding the Accent of Letters and Dots, whether as the Sephardic or Ashkenazi Jews'' (בירור בענין מבטא האותיות והנקודות, אם כמו הספרדים או כמו האשכנזים), published in ''Responsa Yitzhak Yeranen'', part iv, section 9, Bnei Barak 1991, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21373&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=73&amp;hilite= page 73], by Rabbi Hayim Yitzhak Barda.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''meteg'', or ''ga’ayah'', has actually two functions: (1) It extends the sound of the vowel; (2) It makes any [[Shva|šewa]] that is written immediately after the vowel a mobile ''šewa'', meaning, the ''šewa'' itself takes on the sound of a [[schwa|reduced vowel]] in [[Germanic languages]], equivalent to [[ə|{{IPA|ə}}]], or "a" in the word "about." For example: ''šoː m&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt; ru''= &lt;big&gt;('''שָׁמְרו''')&lt;/big&gt;, ''ye r&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt; du''= &lt;big&gt;('''יֵרְדו''')&lt;/big&gt;, ''ye d&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt; ‘u''= &lt;big&gt;('''יֵדְעו''')&lt;/big&gt;, ''ʔö m&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt; rim''= &lt;big&gt;('''אוֹמְרים''')&lt;/big&gt;, ''šö m&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt; rim''= &lt;big&gt;({{nbsp}}'''שׁוֹמְרים''')&lt;/big&gt;, ''sī s&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt; ra''= &lt;big&gt;('''סִיסְרא''')&lt;/big&gt;, ''šū v&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt; kha''= &lt;big&gt;('''שׁוּבְך''')&lt;/big&gt; and ''tū v&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt; kha''= &lt;big&gt;('''טוּבְך''')&lt;/big&gt;, et al.

The ''Qamats qatan'' is realized as the non-extended "o"-sound in the first ''qamats'' (''qamaṣ'') in the word, &lt;big&gt;חָכְמָה&lt;/big&gt; ⇒ ''ḥokhma'' (wisdom).

The Yemenite ''qamaṣ'' {{angle bracket|&lt;big&gt;{{Hebrew|{{nbsp}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x05B8;&amp;nbsp;}}&lt;/big&gt;}}, represented in the transliterated texts by the [[diaphoneme]] {{IPAslink|oː}}, is pronounced as the English "a"-sound in "'''a'''ll" or as in "h'''a'''lt", or "c'''au'''ght," and this phoneme is always the same, whether for a long or short vowel, but the long vowel sound is always prolonged.

====''Holam'' and ''sere''====
A distinct feature of Yemenite Hebrew is that there is some degree of approximation between the ''[[Holam|ḥōlam]]'' and the ''[[Tzere|ṣêrệ]]''. To the untrained ear, they may sound as the same phoneme, but Yemenite grammarians will point out the difference. The feature varies by dialect:

*In the standard, provincial pronunciation that is used by most Yemenite Jews, ''holam'' is pronounced as {{IPA|/øː/}}. For example, the word "''shalom''" ({{Lang-he-n|'''שָׁלוֹם'''}}), is pronounced ''sholøm'', the {{IPA|/øː/}} having the phonetic sound of something between a [[non-rhotic]] English "er" and the German ''[[ö]]''. For all practical purposes, the sound is similar to the "i" in ''girl''.
*In some provincial dialects, in particular that of [[Aden]], ''holam'' becomes a long ''e'' and is indeed indistinguishable from ''sere'', and some early manuscripts sometimes confuse or interchange the symbols for the two sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Z. Idelsohn (1882 – 1938) wrote in his momentous work, ''Phonographierte Gesänge und Aussprachsproben des Hebräischen der jemenitischen, persischen und syrischen Juden'', Vienna 1917, concerning the differences in pronunciation between the Jews of Ṣanʻā’ and the Jews of the provinces in Yemen: "…The difference subsists in the vowel [ḥolam] וֹ, [which] in Ṣanʻā’ is äu &lt;like in Häuser, very close to oy in Yiddish, without accentuating too much the "i" of "oy"&gt;, [and] in the Provinces is ä &lt;like in mächtig, or the French è, like the first "e" when saying Esther in Hebrew&gt;. Furthermore, the consonant [‘ayin] "ע" [in] Ṣanʻā’ = ‘, [but in the] Provinces is י (yod) &amp;lt;transcription of ij with the "j" audible&amp;gt;; also א and ע they pronounce the same way. (Analogies can also be found in the Yemenite Arabic). Moreover, the [dotted] גּ in Ṣanʻā’ is dj &lt;pronounced like the French "j" which is like the English "g" in Geneva&gt;, [but] in the provinces it is like "g" &lt;as in "go"&gt;."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some see the assimilation of the two vowels as a local variant within the wider Babylonian family, which the Yemenites happened to follow.&lt;ref&gt;On the interchange of Ḥolem and Ṣere, [[Geoffrey Khan]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] wrote in his article, ''Vocalization, Babylonian'' (p. 956): “The Karaite al-Qirqisānī, writing in the 10th century C.E., states that some Jews of Iraq said '''קָדֵישׁ''' ''qåḏēš'' instead of '''קָדוֹשׁ''' ''qåḏōš'' ‘holy’ due to influence from the language of the ‘Nabaṭ’ (i.e., the Aramaic speaking population of Iraq). Compare: [[Jacob Qirqisani|al-Qirqisānī]], ''Kitāb al-’Anwār w-al-Marāqib'', ed. Nemoy 1939:II 140.” Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]] in ''Collected Papers'' (vol. 2, pp. 944&amp;ndash;945) argues that the old pronunciation of ''ḥolem'' in Ereẓ Israel was like the Yemenite pronunciation of today, based on [[Mishnah]] ''Eduyot'' 1:3 and on [[Maimonides]]' explanation there, where [[Abtalion]] and [[Shmaya (tanna)|Shemaiah]], two foreigners who converted to Judaism, could not pronounce the ''ḥolem'' of '''מלוא הין''' (''melō hin'') in Mishnah ''Eduyot'' 1:3 but would say what sounded like ''mela hin''. Rabbi Qafih thus thought that the anomaly could not have been possible unless the original pronunciation of ''ḥolem'' was used by the Yemenite Jews in their pronunciation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Strict application of Mobile Shewā ====
Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] and Rabbi [[Jacob Saphir]] have praised the Yemenites in their correct pronunciation of Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Preface to Siddur ''Tefillat Kol Pe'' (ed. Rabbi Avraham al-Nadaf), Tel-Aviv 1960, pp. 7-8 (Hebrew); [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/22331 Jacob Saphir, Iben Safir] (vol. 1), Lyck 1866, pp. 53b-54a (in PDF pp. 121-122) (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; They still read the biblical lections and liturgies according to what is prescribed for Hebrew grammar and are meticulous to pronounce the mobile ''šĕwā'' {{Lang-he-n|'''שוא נע'''}} in each of its changing forms. While most other communities also adhere to the rule of mobile ''[[šĕwā]]'' whenever two ''šĕwā''s are written one after the other, as in {{Lang-he-n|'''יִכְתְּבוּ'''}}, most have forgotten its other usages.
[[File:Dagesh-and-shva.png|thumb|right|Mobile shĕwā]]

[[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher|Aharon Ben-Asher]], in his treatise on the proper usage of Hebrew vowels and trope symbols, writes on the ''šĕwā'': "[It is] the servant of all the letters in the entire Scriptures, whether at the beginning of the word, or in the middle of the word, or at the end of the word; whether what is pronounced by the tongue or not pronounced, for it has many ways… However, if it is joined with one of four [guttural] letters, א ח ה ע, its manner [of pronunciation] will be like the manner of the vowel of the second letter in that word, such as: '''&lt;big&gt;בְּֽהֹנוֹת&lt;/big&gt; ידיהם ורגליהם''' &lt;small&gt;(Jud. 1:7)&lt;/small&gt; = ''b&lt;sup&gt;ö&lt;/sup&gt;honoth''; '''מתי פתים &lt;big&gt;תְּֽאֵהֲבוּ&lt;/big&gt; פתי''' &lt;small&gt;(Prov. 1:22)&lt;/small&gt; = ''t&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;’ehavu''; '''עיניו &lt;big&gt;לְֽחֵלְכָה&lt;/big&gt; יצפנו''' &lt;small&gt;(Ps. 10:8)&lt;/small&gt; = ''l&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;ḥeləkhah''; '''שריה &lt;big&gt;רְֽעֵלָיָה&lt;/big&gt; מרדכי''' &lt;small&gt;(Ezra 2:2)&lt;/small&gt; = ''r&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;ʻeloyoh''."&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Ben-Asher, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/38509 ''Sefer midiqduqe ha-ṭaʻamim''], [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38509&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=53 p. 12 (p. 53 in PDF)]. In the original Hebrew: סדר שוא, המשרתת לכל האותיות בכל המקרא בראש התיבה ובאמצע התיבה ובסוף התיבה ואשר תצא בלשון ואשר לא תצא. כי הרבה דרכים יש לה[...] אבל אם תצטרף עם אחד מן ארבעה אותיות אחה"ע יהיה דרכה על דרך נִקּוד האות השני שבתיבה, כמו בְּֽהֹנות ידיהם ורגליהם (שופטים א', ז,) עד מתי פתים תְּֽאֵהבו פתי (משלי א', כ"ב) עיניו לְֽחֵלכה יצפנו (תהלים י', ח') שריה רִֽעֵליה מרדכי (עזרא ב', ב,).&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Shwa-gaja.jpg|thumb|right| Mobile shewa (shĕwā-jiʻya)]]

On the mobile ''šĕwā'' and its usage amongst Yemenite Jews, Israeli grammarian [[Shelomo Morag]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Shelomo Morag, ''The Samaritan and Yemenite Tradition of Hebrew'' (published in ''The Traditions of Hebrew and Aramaic of the Jews of Yemen'' - ed. Yosef Tobi), Tel-Aviv 2001, pp. 220-221&lt;/ref&gt; "The pronunciation of the ''šĕwā'' mobile preceding א, ה, ח, ע, or ר in the Yemenite tradition is realized in accordance with the vowel following the guttural; quantitatively, however, this is an ultra-short vowel. For example, a word such as {{Lang-he-n|'''וְחוּט'''}} is pronounced ''w&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;ḥuṭ''. A ''šĕwā'' preceding a ''yōḏ'' is pronounced as an ultra-short ''ḥīreq'': the word {{Lang-he-n|'''בְּיוֹם'''}} is pronounced ''b&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;yōm''. This is the way the ''šĕwā'' is known to have been pronounced in the Tiberian tradition."

Other examples of words of the mobile ''šĕwā'' in the same word taking the phonetic sound of the vowel assigned to the adjacent guttural letter&lt;ref&gt;The four guttural letters, according to Rabbi Saadia Gaon (882-942 CE) in his Judeo-Arabic commentary on ''Sefer Hayeṣirah'' (chapter 4, paragraph 3), and Yonah ibn Ǧanāḥ (c. 990 – c. 1050) in his ''Sefer HaRiqmah'', are ''aleph'' (א), ''hé'' (ה), ''ḥet'' (ח) and ''‘ayin'' (ע), and are produced from the depth of the tongue with the opening of the throat.&lt;/ref&gt; or of a mobile ''šĕwā'' before the letter ''yod'' (י) taking the phonetic sound of the ''yod'', can be seen in the following: 
*(Gen. 48:21) {{Lang-he-n|'''וְהֵשִׁיב'''}} = ''w&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;heshiv''
*(Gen. 49:30) {{Lang-he-n|'''בַּמְּעָרָה '''}} = ''bam&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;ʻoroh''
*(Gen. 50:10) {{Lang-he-n|''' בְּעֵבֶר'''}} = ''b&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;ʻevar''

The above rule applies only to when one of the four guttural letters (אחהע), or a ''yod'' (י) or a resh (ר) follows the mobile ''šĕwā'', but it does not apply to the other letters; then, the mobile ''šĕwā'' is always read as a short-sounding ''pataḥ''.

== Distinctive pronunciations preserved ==
Geographically isolated for centuries, the Yemenite Jews constituted a peculiar phenomenon within Diaspora Jewry. In their isolation, they preserved specific traditions of both Hebrew and Aramaic. The traditions, transmitted from generation to generation through the teaching and reciting of the Bible, post-biblical Hebrew literature (primarily the [[Mishnah]]), the [[Aramaic Targum]]s of the Bible, and the [[Babylonian Talmud]], are still alive.&lt;ref name=tel-aviv2001&gt;''The Traditions of Hebrew and Aramaic of the Jews of Yemen'' (ed. Yosef Tobi), in Article entitled: ''Notes on the Vowel System of Babylonian Aramaic as Preserved in the Yemenite Tradition'', Shelomo Morag, Tel-Aviv, 2001, p. 181. {{ISBN|965-7247-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are manifest in the traditional manner of reading Hebrew that is practised by most members of the community. The Yemenite reading traditions of the Bible are now based on the Tiberian text and vocalization,&lt;ref name=tel-aviv2001 /&gt; as proofread by the [[masorete]], [[Aaron ben Asher]], with the one exception that the vowel ''sǝġūl'' is pronounced as a ''pataḥ'', since the ''sǝġūl'' did not exist in the Babylonian orthographic tradition to which the Jews of Yemen had previously been accustomed. In what concerns Biblical orthography, with the one exception of the ''sǝgūl'', the Yemenite Jewish community does not differ from any other Jewish community.&lt;ref name=tel-aviv2001 /&gt;

Although the vast majority of post-Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic words are pronounced the same way or nearly the same way by all of Israel's diverse ethnic groups, including the Jews of Yemen, there are still other words whose phonemic system differs greatly from the way it is used in Modern Hebrew, the sense here being the tradition of vocalization or [[orthoepy|diction]] of selective Hebrew words found in the Mishnah and Midrashic literature, or of Aramaic words found in the Talmud, and which tradition has been meticulously preserved by the [[Jews of Yemen]]. The following diagrams show a few of the more conspicuous differences in the Yemenite tradition of vocalization and which Israeli linguist, [[Shelomo Morag]], believes reflects an ancient form of vocalizing the texts and was once known and used by all Hebrew-speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Shelomo Morag, ''The Traditions of Hebrew and Aramaic of the Jews of Yemen'' (ed. Yosef Tobi), in Article entitled: ''Notes on the Vowel System of Babylonian Aramaic as Preserved in the Yemenite Tradition'', Tel-Aviv 2001, p. 183. {{ISBN|965-7247-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes on transliteration:''' In the Yemenite Jewish tradition, the vowel ''[[qamaṣ]]'' {{angle bracket|&lt;big&gt;{{Hebrew|{{nbsp}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x05B8;&amp;nbsp;}}&lt;/big&gt;}}, represents {{IPAslink|oː}}. The Hebrew character ''Tau'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''ת'''}}), without a dot of accentuation, represents {{IPAslink|θ}}. The Hebrew character ''Gimal'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''גּ'''}}), with a dot of accentuation, represents {{IPAslink|dʒ}}. The Hebrew word '''&lt;big&gt;גנאי&lt;/big&gt;''' (in the above middle column, and meaning 'a thing detestable'), is written in Yemenite Jewish tradition with a vowel ''[[qamaṣ]]'' beneath the {{Lang-he-n|'''נ'''}}, but since it is followed by the letters '''&lt;big&gt;אי&lt;/big&gt;''' it represents {{IPAslink|ɔɪ}}.&lt;ref&gt;Shelomo Morag, ''The Traditions of Hebrew and Aramaic of the Jews of Yemen'' (ed. Yosef Tobi), in Article entitled: ''Notes on the Vowel System of Babylonian Aramaic as Preserved in the Yemenite Tradition'', Tel-Aviv 2001, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; The vowel ''ḥolam'' in the Yemenite dialect is transcribed here with {{angbr|ö}}, and represents a front rounded vowel. Another peculiarity with the Yemenite dialect is that the vast majority of Yemenite Jews (excluding the Jews of Sharab in Yemen) will replace {{IPAslink|q}}, used here in transliteration of texts, with the phonetic sound of {{IPAblink|ɡ}}.

The Hebrew word '''חֲתִיכָּה''' (''ḥăṯīkkah'') is the noun, "piece" (in the absolute state), or '''חֲתִיכַּת בשר''' ("piece of meat") in the construct state. The word is of the same metre as '''קליפּה''' (''qǝlipah''), the noun for "peel," or the "rind" of a fruit. Both the [[Kaph|kaf]] and ''[[Pe (letter)|pe]]'' in these words are accentuated with a dot (''dagesh''). However, when these same words are used as a verb, showing action, as in "cutting a piece" or in "peeling an apple," the words take on a different form, and would respectively be '''חֲתִיכָה''' (''ḥăṯīḫah'') and '''קליפָה''' (''qǝlīfah''), without dots of accentuation in the Hebrew characters [[Kaph|kaf]] and ''[[Pe (letter)|pe]]'' (i.e. ''rafe'' letters), such as when the verb is used with the preposition "after": e.g. "after peeling the apple" = '''אחרי קליפת התפוח''', or "after cutting the meat" = '''אחרי חתיכת הבשר'''.&lt;/ref&gt; || &lt;span style="font-size:100%;line-height:130%"&gt;''ḥă{{IPA-he|θ|}}īk{{IPAlink|oː|}}''&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;big&gt;חֲתִיכָה&lt;/big&gt; || ''{{IPA-he|ħ|}}atī{{IPA-he|χ|}}a''

It is to be noted that in the Yemenite tradition, the plural endings on the words '''זָכִיּוֹת''' ({{nbsp}}''merits''), '''מַלְכִיּוֹת''' (''kingdoms''), '''גָּלִיּוֹת''' (''exiles''), '''טעִיּוֹת''' ({{nbsp}}''errors''), '''טרפִיּוֹת''' (''defective animals'') and '''עֵדִיּוֹת''' (''testimonies''), all differ from the way they are vocalized in Modern Hebrew. In Modern Hebrew, these words are marked with a ''shuraq'', as follows:  '''זָכֻיּוֹת''' - '''מַלְכֻיּוֹת''' - '''גָּלֻיּוֹת''' - '''טעֻיּוֹת''' - '''טרפֻיּוֹת''' - '''עֵדֻיּוֹת'''. Although the word {{Lang-he-n|'''מַלְכֻיוֹת'''}} (''kingdoms'') in Daniel 8:22 is vocalized ''malkhuyöth'', as it is in Modern Hebrew, [[Shelomo Morag]] thinks that the Yemenite tradition reflects a phonological phenomenon known as [[dissimilation]], whereby similar consonants or vowels in a word become less similar.&lt;ref&gt;Shelomo Morag, ''The Traditions of Hebrew and Aramaic of the Jews of Yemen'' (ed. Yosef Tobi), Tel-Aviv 2001, p. 111 ({{ISBN|965-7247-00-4}}) (Hebrew/English).&lt;/ref&gt; Others explain the discrepancy as being in accordance with a general rule of practice, prevalent in the 2nd century CE, where the Hebrew in rabbinic literature was distinguished from that of Biblical Hebrew, and put into an entire class and category of its own, with its own rules of vocalization (see ''infra'').

The Hebrew noun '''חֲתִיכָּה''' (''ḥăṯīkkah''), in the upper left column, is a word meaning "slice/piece" (in the absolute state), or '''חֲתִיכַּת בשר''' ("piece of meat") in the construct state. The noun is of the same metre as '''קְלִיפָּה''' (''qǝlipah''), a word meaning "peel," or the "rind" of a fruit. Both the ''[[kaph]]'' and ''[[Pe (letter)|pe]]'' in these nouns are with a ''dagesh''. However, the same roots applied to different meters, serving as gerunds, as in "slicing/cutting" [meat] and "peeling" [an apple], the words would respectively be '''חֲתִיכָה''' (''ḥăṯīḫah'') and '''קליפָה''' (''qǝlīfah''), without a ''dagesh'' in the Hebrew characters ''[[Kaph]]'' and ''[[Pe (letter)|Pe]]'' (i.e. ''rafe'' letters), such as when the verb is used with the preposition "after": e.g. "after peeling the apple" = '''אחרי קליפת התפוח''', or "after cutting the meat" = '''אחרי חתיכת הבשר'''.

In the [[Babylonian Talmud|Talmud]] &lt;small&gt;(''Ḥullin'' 137b; ''Avodah Zarah'' 58b)&lt;/small&gt;, the Sages of Israel had a practice to read words derived from the Scriptures in their own given way, while the same words derived from the Talmud or in other exegetical literature (known as the [[Midrash]]) in a different way: "When Isse the son of Hinei went up [there], he found Rabbi Yoḥanan teaching [a certain Mishnah] to the creations, saying, ''raḥelim'' (i.e. '''רחלים''' = the Hebrew word for "ewes"), etc. He said to him, 'Teach it [by its Mishnaic name = '''רחלות'''], ''raḥeloth''!' He replied, '[What I say is] as it is written [in the Scriptures]: Ewes (''raḥelim''), two-hundred.' &lt;small&gt;(Gen. 32:15)&lt;/small&gt; He answered him, 'The language of the Torah is by itself, and the language employed by the Sages is by itself!'" ('''לשון תורה לעצמה, לשון חכמים לעצמן''').&lt;ref&gt;Shelomo Morag, ''The Traditions of Hebrew and Aramaic of the Jews of Yemen'' (ed. Yosef Tobi), Tel-Aviv 2001, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

This passage from the Talmud is often quoted by grammarians of Yemenite origin to explain certain "discrepancies" found in vocalization of words where a comparable source can be found in the Hebrew Bible, such as the Yemenite tradition in rabbinic literature to say {{Lang-he-n|'''מַעְבִּיר'''}} (''maʻbīr''),&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Amar Halevi, ''Talmud Bavli Menuqad'', vol. 2, Jerusalem 1980, s.v. Mishnah (''Shabbath'' 21:3); ''ibid''., vol. 6, ''Megillah'' 6b, '''אין מַעְבִּירין על המצות''', et al. See past-tense of the verb in Yosef Amar Halevi, ''ibid.'', vol. 12, Jerusalem 1980, s.v. Mishnah (''Baba Kama'' 8:6), et al.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than {{Lang-he-n|'''מַעֲבִיר'''}} (''maʻăvīr'') – although the latter rendering appears in Scripture &lt;small&gt;(Deuteronomy 18:10)&lt;/small&gt;, or to say {{Lang-he-n|'''זִיעָה'''}} (''zīʻah''), with ''ḥīraq'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Yosef Amar Halevi, ''Talmud Bavli Menuqad'', vol. 4, Jerusalem 1980, s.v. ''Pesaḥim'' 24b, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than, {{Lang-he-n|'''זֵיעָה'''}} (''zeʻah''), with ''ṣerê'', although it too appears in Scripture &lt;small&gt;(Genesis 3:19)&lt;/small&gt;, or to say {{Lang-he-n|'''ברכת המזון'''}} (''birkhath ha-mazon'') (= ''[[kaph]]'' [[rafe]]), rather than as the word "blessing" in the construct state which appears in the Scriptures &lt;small&gt;(Genesis 28:4, et al.)&lt;/small&gt;, e.g. ''birkath Avraham'' ('''ברכת אברהם'''), with ''kaph'' [[dagesh]]. Others, however, say that these anomalies reflect a tradition that antedates the Tiberian [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic texts]].&lt;ref&gt;''Divrei Shalom Ḥakhamim'' (Memorial book in honor of Rabbi Shalom Yitzhak Halevi), ed. Avner Yitzhak Halevi, Jerusalem 1993, Introduction on the Vowel Points, pp. 217 – 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shelomo Morag, ''The Traditions of Hebrew and Aramaic of the Jews of Yemen'', Tel-Aviv 2001, p. 30. {{ISBN|965-7247-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Yemenite tradition, many words in both Biblical and Mishnaic Hebrew which are written with the final ''hê'' ending (without the ''mappîq'') are realized by a secondary [[Glottalization|glottal stop]], meaning, they are abruptly cut short, as when one holds his breath. Shelomo Morag who treats upon this peculiarity in the Yemenite tradition of vocalization brings down two examples from the Book of Isaiah, although by no means exclusive, where he shows the transliteration for the words &lt;big&gt;'''תִּפָּדֶה'''&lt;/big&gt; in Isaiah 1:27 and &lt;big&gt;'''וְנֵלְכָה'''&lt;/big&gt; in Isaiah 2:5, and both of which represent {{IPAslink|ʔ}}, as in ''tippoːdä{{nbsp}}(ʔ)'' and ''wǝnel&lt;sup&gt;ă&lt;/sup&gt;χoː(ʔ)'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Shelomo Morag, ''The Hebrew of the Jews of Yemen'' ({{nbsp}}'''העברית שבפי יהודי תימן'''), Academy of the Hebrew Language: Jerusalem 1963, pp. 4–5 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; The word '''פָרָשָׁה''' (Bible Codex&lt;ref&gt;In Modern Hebrew, the word "parashah" means the weekly biblical lection read on each Sabbath day, but in the Yemenite Jewish tradition the word means "Bible Codex."&lt;/ref&gt;) in the upper-middle column is pronounced in the same way, e.g. ''f{{IPAlink|oː}}r{{IPAlink|oː}}sh{{IPAlink|oː}}{{IPAlink|ʔ}}''.

| &lt;big&gt;שֶׁלְּ...  שֶׁלַּ...  שֶׁלִּ... שֶׁלָּ...&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The preposition "of" in Hebrew. In the Yemenite Jewish tradition, the Hebrew preposition is always written with the noun, joined together as one word, and the "lamed" is always accentuated with a ''dagesh''. For example, if the noun ('''מלך''' = king) would normally have been written with the definite article "the," as in &lt;big&gt;הַמֶּלֶךְ&lt;/big&gt; (the king), and the noun was to show possession, as in the sentence: "the palace '''of''' the king," the definite article "the" (Hebrew: '''ה''') is dropped, but the same vowel ''pataḥ'' of the definite article is carried over to the ''lamed'', as in &lt;big&gt;שֶׁלַּמֶּלֶךְ&lt;/big&gt;, instead of של המלך. The vowel on the ''lamed'' will sometimes differ, depending on what noun comes after the preposition. For example, the definite article "the" in Hebrew nouns which begin with ''aleph'' or ''resh'', such as in &lt;big&gt;הָאָדָם&lt;/big&gt; and in &lt;big&gt;הָרִאשׁוֹן&lt;/big&gt;, is always written with the vowel ''qamaṣ'' – in which case, the vowel ''qamaṣ'' is carried over to the ''lamed'', as in &lt;big&gt;שֶׁלָּאָדָם&lt;/big&gt; and in &lt;big&gt;שֶׁלָּרִאשׁוֹן&lt;/big&gt;. Another general rule is that whenever a possessive noun is written without the definite article "the", as in the words, "a king's scepter," or "the sceptre of a king" (Heb. '''מלך'''), the ''lamed'' in the preposition is written with the vowel ''shǝwa'', as in &lt;big&gt;שרביט שֶׁלְּמֶּלֶךְ&lt;/big&gt;. Whenever the noun begins with a ''shǝwa'', as in the proper noun ''Solomon'' (Heb. &lt;big&gt;שְׁלֹמֹה&lt;/big&gt;) and one wanted to show possession, the ''lamed'' in the preposition is written with a ''ḥiraq'', as in (''Song of Solomon'' 3:7): "Solomon's bed," = &lt;big&gt;מטתו שֶׁלִּשְׁלֹמֹה&lt;/big&gt;.

'''Excursus:''' The preposition ({{Lang-he-n|שֶׁלְּ...  שֶׁלַּ...  שֶׁלִּ... שֶׁלָּ ...}}), translated as  ''of''  or ''belonging to'' in English, is unique in the Yemenite Jewish tradition. The Hebrew preposition is always written with the noun, joined together as one word, and the ''lamed'' is always accentuated with a ''dagesh''. For example, if the noun, '''מלך''' ⇒ ''king'', would normally have been written with the definite article "the," as in &lt;big&gt;הַמֶּלֶךְ&lt;/big&gt; ⇒ ''the king'', and the noun was to show possession, as in the sentence: "the palace '''of''' the king," the definite article "the" (Hebrew: '''ה''') is dropped, but the same vowel ''pataḥ'' of the definite article is carried over to the ''lamed'', as in &lt;big&gt;שֶׁלַּמֶּלֶךְ&lt;/big&gt;, instead of של המלך. The vowel on the ''lamed'' will sometimes differ, depending on what noun comes after the preposition. For example, the definite article "the" in Hebrew nouns which begin with ''aleph'' or ''resh'' and sometimes ''ayin'', such as in &lt;big&gt;הָאָדָם&lt;/big&gt; and in &lt;big&gt;הָרִאשׁוֹן&lt;/big&gt;, or in &lt;big&gt;הָעוֹלָם&lt;/big&gt;, is written with the vowel ''qamaṣ'' – in which case, the vowel ''qamaṣ'' is carried over to the ''lamed'', as in &lt;big&gt;שֶׁלָּאָדָם&lt;/big&gt; and in &lt;big&gt;שֶׁלָּרִאשׁוֹן&lt;/big&gt; and in &lt;big&gt;שֶׁלָּעוֹלָם&lt;/big&gt;. Another general rule is that whenever a possessive noun is written without the definite article "the", as in the words, "a king's sceptre," or "the sceptre of a king" (Heb. '''מלך'''), the ''lamed'' in the preposition is written with the vowel ''shǝwa'' (i.e. mobile ''shǝwa''), as in &lt;big&gt;שרביט שֶׁלְּמֶּלֶךְ&lt;/big&gt;, and as in, "if it belongs to Israel" ⇒ &lt;big&gt;אם הוא שֶׁלְּיִשְׂרַאֵל&lt;/big&gt;. Whenever the noun begins with a ''shǝwa'', as in the proper noun ''Solomon'' (Heb. &lt;big&gt;שְׁלֹמֹה&lt;/big&gt;) and one wanted to show possession, the ''lamed'' in the preposition is written with a ''ḥiraq'', as in (''Song of Solomon'' 3:7): &lt;big&gt;מטתו שֶׁלִּשְׁלֹמֹה&lt;/big&gt; ⇒ "Solomon's bed", or as in &lt;big&gt;עונשם שֶׁלִּרְשָׁעִים&lt;/big&gt; ⇒ "the punishment '''of''' the wicked", or in &lt;big&gt;חבילה שֶׁלִּתְרוּמָה&lt;/big&gt; ⇒ "a bundle '''of''' heave-offering."&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Amar Halevi, ''Talmud Bavli Menuqad'', vol. 15, Jerusalem 1980, s.v. ''Sanhedrin'' 104b, et al.; Shelomo Morag, ''The Traditions of Hebrew and Aramaic of the Jews of Yemen'', Tel-Aviv 2001, p. 256 {{ISBN|965-7247-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another rule of practice in Hebrew grammar is that two ''shǝwa''s &lt;big&gt;חְ&lt;/big&gt; are never written one after the other at the beginning of any word; neither can two ''ḥaṭaf pataḥ''s &lt;big&gt;חֲ&lt;/big&gt; or two ''ḥaṭaf sǝġūl''s &lt;big&gt;חֱ&lt;/big&gt; be written at the beginning of a word one after the other. The practical implication arising from this rule is that when there is a noun beginning with a ''ḥaṭaf pataḥ'', as in the word, &lt;big&gt;חֲבִרְתָּהּ&lt;/big&gt; ⇒ “her companion”, and one wishes to add thereto the preposition “to” – as in, “to her companion” ⇒ &lt;big&gt;לַחֲבִרְתָּהּ&lt;/big&gt;, the ''lamed'' is written with the vowel ''pataḥ'', instead of a ''shǝwa'' (i.e. a mobile ''shǝwa''), seeing that the ''shǝwa'' at the beginning of a word and the ''ḥaṭaf pataḥ'', as well as the ''ḥaṭaf sǝġūl'', are all actually one and the same vowel (in the Babylonian tradition), and it is as though he had written two ''shǝwa''s one after the other. Likewise, in the possessive case, “belonging to her companion” ⇒ &lt;big&gt;שֶׁלַּחֲבִרְתָּהּ&lt;/big&gt;, the ''lamed'' in the preposition &lt;big&gt;של&lt;/big&gt; is written with the vowel ''pataḥ''.

== Hebrew vernacular ==
The Leiden MS. of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] is important in that it preserves some earlier variants to textual readings of that Talmud, such as in Tractate ''Pesaḥim'' 10:3 (70a), which brings down the old Palestinian-Hebrew word for [[Charoset|''charoseth'']] (the sweet relish eaten at Passover), viz. ''dūkeh'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''דוכה'''}}), instead of ''rūbeh/rabah'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''רובה'''}}), saying with a play on words: “The members of Isse's household would say in the name of Isse: Why is it called ''dūkeh''? It is because she pounds [the spiced ingredients] with him.” The Hebrew word for "pound" is ''dakh'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''דך'''}}), which rules out the spelling of " ''rabah'' " ({{Lang-he-n|'''רבה'''}}), as found in the printed editions. Today, the [[Jews of Yemen]], in their vernacular of Hebrew, still call the ''charoseth'' by the name ''dūkeh''.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. דּוּכֵּהּ (p. 54).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other quintessential Hebrew words which have been preserved by the [[Jews of Yemen]] is their manner of calling a receipt of purchase by the name, ''ro{{IPAlink|ʔ}}{{IPAlink|oː|}}y{{IPAlink|oː|}}'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''רְאָיָה'''}}), rather than the word " ''qabbalah'' " that is now used in Modern Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. רְאָיָה (p. 255).&lt;/ref&gt; The weekly biblical lection read on Sabbath days is called by the name ''seder'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''סדר'''}}), since the word ''parashah'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''פרשה'''}}) has a completely different meaning, denoting a Bible [[Codex]] containing the first Five Books of Moses (plural: codices = '''פרשיות''').&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. פָרָשָׁה (p. 230); see also ''Zekhor Le'Avraham'' (ed. Uzziel Alnaddaf), Jerusalem 1992, p. 27, note 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charity; alms''' ({{lang-he-n|מִצְוָה}}, ''miṣwoː''), so-called in Yemenite Jewish parlance,&lt;ref&gt;S.D. Goitein, ''Hebrew Elements in the Spoken Language of the Jews of Yemen'', pub. by Leshonenu III, Jerusalem 1931; reprinted in: [[Shelomo Dov Goitein]], ''The Yemenites – History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life'' (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, p. 279, s.v. '''מצווה'''; ''ibid''., p. 214. {{ISBN|965-235-011-7}} ; Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. מִצְוָה (p. 167).&lt;/ref&gt; was usually in the form of bread, collected in baskets each Friday before the Sabbath by those appointed over this task for distribution among the needy, without them being brought to shame. The same word is often used throughout the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], as well as in Midrashic literature, to signify what is given out to the poor and needy.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Leviticus Rabba]], section 34: '''כל עמא יפלגון מצוה''' = "let every person distribute charity."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, in [[Modern Hebrew]], the word is seldom used to imply charity, replaced now by the word, ''ts’dakah'' (Heb. '''צְדָקָה'''). In contrast, the word צדקה amongst Jews in Sana’a was a tax levied upon Jewish householders, particularly those whose professions were butchers, and which tax consisted of hides and [[suet]] from butchered animals, and which things were sold on a daily basis by the Treasurer, and the money accruing from the sale committed to the public fund for the Jewish poor of the city, which money was distributed to the city's poor twice a year; once on Passover, and once on Sukkot.&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa’arat Teiman'', Jerusalem 1988, p. 113; in 1954 edition, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7292&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=132&amp;hilite= p. 132 (in PDF)]; Shelomo Dov Goitein, ''The Yemenites – History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life'' (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, pp. 278–279, s.v. צדקה. {{ISBN|965-235-011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund itself was known by the name ''t{{IPAlink|oː|}}ḏer'' ({{lang-he-n|תָּדֵיר}}), lit. "the constant [revenues]."&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. תָּדֵיר (p. 291).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Jews in Yemen widely made-use of the South-Arabic word ''mukhwāṭ'' ({{lang-ar|المُخْوَاط}}) for the “metal pointer” (stylus) used in pointing at the letters of sacred writ, they also knew the old Hebrew word for the same, which they called ''makhtev'' ({{lang-he-n|מַכְתֵּב}}).&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' (אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. מַכְתֵּב (p. 158). Cf. Mishnah ''Kelim'' 16:8; [[Midrash HaGadol]] (on Deuteronomy 28:52).&lt;/ref&gt; The following story is related about this instrument in [[Midrash Rabba]]: “Rabban [Shimon] Gamliel says: ‘Five-hundred schools were in [[Betar (fortress)|Beter]], while the smallest of them wasn’t less than three-hundred children. They used to say, ‘If the enemy should ever come upon us, with these ''metal pointers'' ({{lang-he-n|מַכְתֵּבִין}}) we’ll go out against them and stab them!’…”&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Rabba (Lamentations Rabba 2:5); Jerusalem Talmud, ''Taanit'' 4:5 (24b), with slight variations. Cf. Rashi's commentary on Mishnah ''Avot'' 5:6, where he says of the word והמכתב, "the stylus of a scrivener, ''grafie'' in the foreign tongue, with which He engraved the Ten Commandments that were given to Moses. That same stylus was created of old."&lt;/ref&gt;

In other peculiar words of interest, they made use of the word, ''shilṭön'' ({{Lang-he-n|שִׁלְטוֹן}}), for “governor” or “king,” instead of “government,” the latter word now being the more common usage in Modern Hebrew;&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. שִׁלְטוֹן (p. 278).&lt;/ref&gt; ''kothev'' ({{Lang-he-n|כּוֹתֵב}}), for “scrivener”, or copyist of religious texts, instead of the word “sofer” (scribe);&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. כּוֹתֵב (p. 127).&lt;/ref&gt; ''ṣibbūr'' ({{Lang-he-n|צִבּוּר}}), for "a quorum of at least ten adult males," a word used in Yemen instead of the Modern Hebrew word, ''minyan'';&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. צִבּוּרִים (p. 233).&lt;/ref&gt; ''ḥefeṣ'' ({{Lang-he-n|חֵפֶץ}}), a noun meaning “desirable thing,” was used by them to describe any “book” (especially one of a prophylactic nature), although now in Modern Hebrew it means “object”;&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. חֵפֶץ (p. 101).&lt;/ref&gt; ''fiqfūq'' ({{Lang-he-n|פִקְפוּק}}) had the connotation of “shock,” “violent agitation,” or “shaking-up,” although today, in Modern Hebrew, it has the meaning of “doubt” or “skepticism”;&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. פִקְפוּק (p. 228).&lt;/ref&gt; the word, ''harpathqe'' ({{Lang-he-n|הַרְפַּתְקֵי}}), was used to describe “great hardships,” although in Modern Hebrew the word has come to mean “adventures.”&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. הַרְפַּתְקֵי (pp. 72– 3).&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''fazmūn'' ({{Lang-he-n|פַזְמוּן}}), any happy liturgical poem, such as those sung on ''[[Simhat Torah]]'', differs from today’s Modern Hebrew word, ''pizmon'' ({{Lang-he-n|פִּזְמוֹן}}), meaning, a “chorus” to a song.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. פַזְמוּן (p. 221).&lt;/ref&gt; Another peculiar aspect of Yemenite Hebrew is what concerns denominative verbs. One of the nouns used for bread (made of wheat) is ''himmuṣ'' ({{Lang-he-n|הִמּוּץ}}), derived from the blessing that is said whenever breaking bread, [המוציא [לחם מן הארץ = ''He that brings forth'' [bread from the earth].&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. הִמּוּץ (p. 67).&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever they wanted to say its imperative form, “break bread!”, they made use of the denominative verb ''hammeṣ''! ({{Lang-he-n|הַמֵּץ}}). Similarly, the noun for the Third Sabbath meal was ''qiyyūm'' ({{Lang-he-n|קְיּוּם}}), literally meaning “observance,” in which they made use of the denominative verb, ''tǝqayyem'' ({{Lang-he-n|תְּקַיֵּם מענא}}) = ''Will you eat with us'' (the Third Sabbath meal)?, or, נְקַיֵּם = ''Let us eat'' (the Third Sabbath meal),&lt;ref&gt;Shelomo Dov Goitein, ''The Yemenites – History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life'' (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, p. 279. {{ISBN|965-235-011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, ''qiyam'' ({{Lang-he-n| קִיַּם}}) = ''He ate'' (the Third Sabbath meal).&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, ''Dictionary of the Hebrew Language used by Yemenite Jews'' ('''אוצר לשון הקדש שלבני תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1978, s.v. קִיַּם (p. 247).&lt;/ref&gt;
