__NOTOC__
Year '''467 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Mamercus and Vibulanus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 287 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 467 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

{{Politics of Algeria}}

'''Legislative elections''' were held in [[Algeria]] on 17 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6653487.stm Q&amp;A: Algerian election] BBC News, 15 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 24 political parties and around 100 independent lists with a total of more than 12,000 candidates competed for the 389 seats in the National People's Assembly. While most Algerians voted on May 17, immigrants from Algeria to other countries (especially [[France]]) and Algerians living in the [[Sahara]] (i.e. Southern Algeria) and other [[nomad]]s and semi-nomads voted on May 16 due to the distance from [[Algiers]], the country's capital.

At 35% of the 18.7 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6664165.stm Low turnout in Algeria elections] BBC News, 18 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; voters, the turnout was the lowest in Algerian history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2007/05/2008525143440191791.html Ruling bloc wins Algeria vote] Al-Jazeera, 18 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mg.co.za/article/2007-05-18-algeria-experiences-lowestever-voter-turnout Algeria experiences lowest-ever voter turnout] Mail &amp; Guardian Online, 18 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Several political organisations, notably the [[Front of Socialist Forces]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffs-dz.com/article.php?id_article=419 Le FFS a l’honneur, la liberté et le privilège d’annoncer sa décision de non participation au prochain scrutin législatif] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516023705/http://www.ffs-dz.com/article.php?id_article=419 |date=2007-05-16 }}, FFS, 10 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the ex-communist [[Democratic and Social Movement (Algeria)|Democratic and Social Movement]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200705150109.html La Tribune, 15 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; leading members of the former [[Islamic Salvation Front]] ([[Abbassi Madani]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2007/05/16/feature-01 Algerians play down calls to boycott legislative elections], 16 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ali Belhadj]]), the main faction of the split Islamist [[Movement for National Reform|Islah]] Party,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elislah.net/textspages/bayanet/bayane46.html El Islah release], 14 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the newly formed organisation [[Rachad]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070521052819/http://en.rachad.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=69&amp;Itemid=37 Regarding the “Elections” of 17 May 2007], Rachad, 15 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; had called on their supporters to boycott these elections.  These political groups claimed that the elections were consistently rigged by the government, and that participation merely lent a fundamentally corrupt process undeserved legitimacy.

The only notable remaining armed group in Algeria, the [[Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb]], issued a video calling participation in the elections "a great sin", adding its voice to the boycott calls. Tight security measures were implemented to protect the elections; however, two bombs exploded in [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] the day before the election, killing a police officer and wounding five others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E97A0CD9-6872-4279-9AA7-F50C63549D2C.htm Bombings on eve of Algeria election], Al Jazeera English, 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Said Bouchair]], the head of the national commission of legislative election control, initially reported that ballot boxes in some areas were being stuffed with FLN ballots, that observers were being prevented from attending, and that some areas refused to open ballot boxes before voting began to allow observers to see whether they were empty or not.  He then retracted his statement and apologised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elkhabar.com/FrEn/lire.php?ida=69307&amp;idc=52  Bouchair complains to president then retracted and apologized], El Khabar 19 May 2007, [http://actualite.el-annabi.com/article.php3?id_article=5524  Algérie : Bouchaïr crie à la fraude puis... se rétracte] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225049/http://actualite.el-annabi.com/article.php3?id_article=5524 |date=2007-09-27 }}, El Annabi 19 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  About 15% of ballots were spoiled.

The Constitutional Council confirmed the results of the election, with slight changes to the voter turn-out rate and number of seats won by some parties, on May 21.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/pays/algerie/article_depeche.asp?art_cle=XIN70027minimlennoi0 "Mini-modification des résultats des législatives par le Conseil constitutionnel"], Xinhua (''[[Jeune Afrique|Jeuneafrique.com]]''), May 22, 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It rejected appeals regarding the election on May 30.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_depeche.asp?art_cle=AFP03647leconiamuds0 "Le Conseil constitutionnel valide les législatives du 17 mai"], AFP (''[[Jeune Afrique|Jeuneafrique.com]]''), May 30, 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''André; a Tragedy in Five Acts''''' is a play by [[William Dunlap]], first produced at the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park Theatre]] in New York City on March 30, 1798, by the [[Old American Company]], published in that same year together with a collection of historic documents relating to the case of the title character, [[John André|Major John André]], the British officer who was hanged as a spy on October 2, 1780, for his role in the treason of [[Benedict Arnold]]. The play does not go into the historic details, but rather presents a fictionalized account of the American debate over whether to spare or hang him. Only three characters in the play are historic: André himself, [[George Washington]] (referred to throughout the text, except once in a passage inserted between the first two performances, simply as "The General"), and [[Honora Sneyd]], who had been briefly engaged to André ten years earlier under the auspices of [[Anna Seward]], who had done much to romanticize the affair in her [[Monody on Major André]] of 1781. (Actually, Honora Sneyd had died of consumption some months before André's death, and never went to America.)

Despite the fictionalization, the play genuinely shows the anguish felt by many on the American side over the necessity to hang the brilliant and charming young officer, and it is written in unusually supple verse for the 18th century.

Apart from its intrinsic merits, the play is noteworthy as the first American tragedy written on an American subject. However, despite being nowadays acknowledged as Dunlap's best piece of work, it was, unfortunately, not a great success at the time. Its lack of popularity stemmed from the controversial lionization of André. Moreover, at opening night, the crowd rose to its feet in anger and indignation when Bland, a soldier in the play, hurled his [[cockade]] to the ground at the prospect of André being sentenced to death. The controversy was twofold— not only was Bland losing composure over the fate of a British spy but the cockade (worn by [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] and then later by the revolutionaries during the [[French revolution|French Revolution]] to emulate their spirit) being tossed to the floor was interpreted by many as Dunlap attacking the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] itself.

Dunlap later recycled much of '''''André''''' into his pageant-play ''The Glory of Columbia, Her Yeomanry'', a piece resonating with the [[populism|Populist]] tone in theatre at the time, and which continued to be regularly produced for fifty years.

== Background ==

=== History ===

The first Aspen Ideas Festival took place in Aspen, Colorado in 2005. The [[Aspen Institute]], under the leadership of [[Walter Isaacson]], developed the Aspen Ideas Festival to gather individuals from various backgrounds and fields of expertise for discussions about global and social issues and innovative ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aspendailynews.com/section/home/157796 |title= Aspen Ideas Festival Speaker and Program Lineup |publisher= Aspen Daily News |accessdate= 2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the first Aspen Ideas Festival in 2005, around 100 speakers attended the festival, among them Jane Goodall, Toni Morrison, Jim Lehrer, Arthur Schlesinger, and many others. The Aspen Ideas Festival modeled its programming for the first festival from some of the Aspen Institute's earliest events, such as the Goethe Bicentennial in 1949.&lt;ref name="denverpost" /&gt;

=== The Aspen Institute ===
{{main article|Aspen Institute}}
The Aspen Institute was founded by [[Walter Paepcke]] in 1950 in Aspen, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ariane-zurcher/ideas-that-make-a-differe_b_1633117.html |title= Ideas That Make a Difference at the Aspen Ideas Festival |publisher= Huffington Post |accessdate= 2013-05-14 |first=Ariane |last=Zurcher |date=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paepcke was a Chicago businessman and the founder of the Container Corporation of American (CCA). As a Germanophile, he and his wife, Elizabeth Paepcke, actualized a celebration and gathering in Aspen in June 1949 to mark the two-hundredth birthday of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. From the success of the Goethe Bicentennial Festival came the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies. Under Paepcke, the Aspen Institute's programs explored a range of topics through lectures and discussions with top thinkers in a variety of fields from science to the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/June-2012/Walter-Paepcke-Founder-of-the-Aspen-Institute-and-Chicago-Patron-of-Mid-Century-Modernism/ |title= Walter Paepcke, Founder of the Aspen Institute and Chicago Patron of Mid-Century Modernism |publisher= Chicago Mag |accessdate= 2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/scrc/findingaids/view.php?eadid=ICU.SPCL.PAEPCKEW |title= Guide to the Walter P. Paepcke Papers 1912-1961 |publisher= University of Chicago Library |accessdate= 2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now based in Washington, D.C. with campuses in Aspen and Maryland, the Aspen Institute hosts programs focused on discussion of education and policy issues where presidents, scientists, artists, ambassadors, [[Nobel laureates]], and many others have been in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aspeninstitute.org/about/history |title= Aspen Institute History |publisher= Aspen Institute |accessdate= 2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speakers ==

Since its inception in 2005, Aspen Ideas Festival speakers have included individuals from a wide range of backgrounds, including politicians, diplomats, presidents, judges, scientists, musicians, entrepreneurs, artists, designers and innovators.

After attending the Aspen Ideas Festival, the Scholars return to their hometowns in order to produce a localized version of the Aspen Ideas Festival, a Local Ideas Festivals, inspired by their experiences in Aspen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bezosfamilyfoundation.org/scholars |title= Bezos Scholars Program @ The Aspen Institute |publisher= Bezos Family Foundation |accessdate= 2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-abelson/bezos-scholars-program-in_b_846705.html |title= Bezos Scholars Program -- Incubating Big Ideas and Model Citizens -- One High School at a Time |publisher= Huffington Post |accessdate= 2013-08-20 |first=Jeffrey |last=Abelson |date=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts ==

In 2012, [[Stanley McChrystal]] was interviewed by [[Bob Schieffer]] at the festival. As part of that interview, McChrystal was asked whether or not he believed in the draft. He responded that he thought every young person should serve, but the military doesn’t need every young person, so we need to create more opportunities for all young Americans to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley McChrystal on Leadership|url=https://www.aspenideas.org/session/stanley-mcchrystal-leadership|website=Aspen Ideas Festival|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Franklin Project]] -- an initiative to make a year of national service a common opportunity and expectation for young Americans -- was created as a result of this festival conversation. [[Walter Isaacson]] called the Franklin Project the “biggest idea” to come out of the festival during his tenure as CEO of the [[Aspen Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carroll|first1=Rick|title=Q&amp;A with Walter Isaacson of the Aspen Institute|url=https://www.aspentimes.com/news/qa-with-walter-isaacson-of-the-aspen-institute/|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Aspen Times|date=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Batwa–Luba clashes''' are a series of ongoing clashes in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) the [[Pygmy]] [[Twa#Congo|Batwa people]],{{efn|name=fn1|The two major divisions of Pygmies in the DRC are the Bambuti, or [[Mbuti people|Mbuti]], who largely live in the [[Ituri forest]] in the northeast, and the [[Twa#Congo|Batwa]], but many Batwa in certain areas of the country also refer to themselves as Bambuti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minorityrights.org/minorities/batwa-and-bambuti/|title=Democratic Republic of the Congo - Batwa and Bambuti|publisher=Minority Rights Group International}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and the [[Luba people]] starting in 2013.

==Background==
The pygmy Batwa are often exploited and allegedly [[Pygmy peoples#slavery|enslaved]]&lt;ref name=hrw1115/&gt; by the Luba and other Bantu groups. While the pygmy never organized militarily to resist, starting with the [[First Congo War]], rebel leader [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], who won the war, organized the Twa into paramilitary groups to help him. His son, [[Joseph Kabila]], who succeeded him, used these militias in the [[Second Congo War]] and against the predominately Luba [[Mai-Mai Kata Katanga]].&lt;ref name=irin0717/&gt;

==Course of the conflict==
[[File:IDPs near Kalemie (2017).jpg|thumb|left|[[Internally displaced person|IDPs]] from [[Nyunzu Territory]] who have fled the clashes between [[Twa#Congo|Batwa]] and [[Luba people|Luba]].]]

In [[Tanganyika Province]], in the northern part of the former [[Katanga Province]], starting in 2013, Pygmy Batwa rose up into militias, such as the "Perci" militia, and attacked Luba villages.&lt;ref name=nytimes0416&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/world/africa/in-congo-wars-are-small-and-chaos-is-endless.html?_r=0|title=In Congo, Wars Are Small and Chaos Is Endless|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=7 March 2017|date=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Luba militia known as "Elements" attacked back, notably killing at least 30 people in the "Vumilia 1" displaced people camp in April 2015. Since the start of the conflict, hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes.&lt;ref name=hrw1115/&gt; The weapons used in the conflict are often arrows, axes, and [[machete]]s, rather than guns.&lt;ref name=nytimes0416/&gt;&lt;ref name="gegen Bantu"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Kongo-Pygmaeen-gegen-Bantu-3820135.html |title=Kongo: Pygmäen gegen Bantu |last1=Mühlbauer |first1=Peter |work=[[Heinz Heise]] |language=German |date=1 September 2017|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Pygmy and Luba leaders sign a peace deal to end the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congodemocratic-conflict/pygmy-and-bantu-leaders-sign-peace-deal-in-southeast-congo-idUSKCN0SF1YY20151021|title=Pygmy and Bantu leaders sign peace deal in southeast Congo|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=30 December 2017|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, the United Nations along with provincial authorities established local councils called "baraza" to address grievances and this appeared to reduce the violence.&lt;ref name=irin0717&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/feature/2017/07/11/displaced-congolese-civilians-sent-back-widening-war|title=Displaced Congolese civilians sent back to a widening war|publisher=irinnews.com|accessdate=18 July 2017|date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, clashes intensified at the end of 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/UNICEF%20DR%20Congo%20Humanitarian%20Sitrep%2C%20November-December%202016.pdf|title=Democratic Republic of the Congo Humanitarian Situation Report|publisher=Reliefweb}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the government tried to enforce a tax on caterpillars that the Batwa harvest as important food source,&lt;ref name="gegen Bantu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37695489 |title='Caterpillar tax': DR Congo ethnic clash sees 16 killed |last1= |first1= |work=[[BBC]] |date=18 October 2016 |accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the military attempted to arrest a Twa warlord.&lt;ref name=irin0717/&gt; Both of these events led to a violent backlash and a spread of the fighting.&lt;ref name=irin0717/&gt;&lt;ref name="gegen Bantu" /&gt; Twa militias also started to target Tutsis, another Bantu group, by slaughtering their cows.&lt;ref name=irin0717/&gt; 

A ceasefire brokered by the [[United Nations]] in February 2017 failed, and the violence continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taz.de/!5441270/ |title=Vertrieben und schutzlos |last1=Johnson |first1=Dominic |work=[[Die Tageszeitung]] |language=German |date=1 September 2017|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, the clashes intensified after Batwa attacked a group of Luba near [[Kalemie]]; in course of the following fighting about 50 people died, most of them Luba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-security/dozens-killed-in-ethnic-violence-in-eastern-congo-idUSKBN1AM0HM |title=Dozens killed in ethnic violence in eastern Congo |author= |work=[[Reuters]] |date=6 August 2017 |accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batwa fighters also attacked a [[MONUSCO]] convoy with arrows. A number of [[United Nations peacekeeping|Blue Helmets]] were wounded, though they still opted not to return fire.&lt;ref name="gegen Bantu" /&gt;

By the end of 2017, 650,000 people had been displaced due to the fighting.&lt;ref name="malnutrition"/&gt; The economy in Tanganyika had mostly collapsed, while fields could no longer be harvested.&lt;ref name="snail"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/en/document/democratic-republic-congo-tanganyika-eat-snails-conflict-violence-hunger |title=Tanganyika: At a snail’s pace |author= |work=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] |date=14 March 2018 |accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As result, malnutrition spread amongst those who had fled,&lt;ref name="malnutrition"/&gt; as well as those who stayed at their homes.&lt;ref name="snail"/&gt;

==Casualties==
===Deaths===
More than a thousand people were killed in the first eight months of 2014 alone.&lt;ref name=irin0717/&gt;

===Displaced people===
The number of displaced people are estimated to be 650,000 as of December 2017.&lt;ref name="malnutrition"/&gt; Around March 2017, 543,000 had fled, up from 370,000 in December 2016, the strongest growth of the current conflicts in the Congo, which has the largest population of displaced people in Africa. Many refugees are allegedly forced by the government to leave the camps and return to their homes, where the fighting still continues.&lt;ref name=irin0717/&gt;

[[File:BuxtonOHuppertiers.jpg|thumb|300px|Upper tiers in the house]]

'''Buxton Opera House''' is in The Square, [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England.  It is a 902-seat opera house that hosts the annual [[Buxton Festival]] and, from 1994 to 2013, the [[International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival]], among others, as well as [[pantomime]] at Christmas, [[musical theatre|musicals]] and other entertainments year-round.  Hosting live performances until 1927, the theatre then was used mostly as a cinema until 1976.  In 1979, it was refurbished and reopened as a venue for live performance.

==History==
It was built in 1903 and designed by [[Frank Matcham]], one of Britain's finest theatre architects. He also designed a number of famous [[London]] theatres, including the [[London Palladium]] (1910) and the [[Coliseum Theatre|London Coliseum]] (1904). 

The Opera House ran as a successful theatre, receiving touring companies until 1927, when it was turned into a cinema.  Silent films were shown until 1932 when the theatre was wired for sound and could present ‘talkies’.  The Opera House also became the venue for an annual summer theatre festival from 1936 to 1942, two of them in conjunction with [[Lillian Bayliss]] and her London-based [[Old Vic]] company.  After the Second World War, the theatre continued to serve primarily as a cinema, although the Literary and Dramatic Societies of local schools [[Buxton College]] and Cavendish Grammar School staged annual performances of either [[Shakespeare]], such as ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1966), ''[[Coriolanus]]'' (1968) and ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1970), or modern works, such as [[Bertold Brecht]]'s ''[[Life of Galileo]]'' (1967) and [[Dylan Thomas]]'s ''The Doctor &amp; the Devils'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Bolton King, R 1973 Buxton College, 1675–1970&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the opera house's former finance chief was jailed for two years for stealing nearly £250,000 from the opera house accounts in 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buxtonadvertiser.co.uk/news/local/ex-finance-chief-jailed-for-250-000-buxton-opera-house-fraud-1-6712061 "Ex-finance chief jailed for £250,000 Buxton Opera House fraud"], ''Buxton Advertiser'', 4 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refurbishment and reception==
[[File:Buxtonstageandpit.jpg|thumb|left|Stage, boxes and orchestra pit]]
The Opera House gradually fell into disrepair.  In 1976, it was closed and rumours circulated that it would never reopen. In 1979, however, it was restored and an [[orchestra pit]] was added to the original Frank Matcham design.  Since then, the Opera House has been a full-time venue for stage productions, presenting approximately 450 performances per year, including opera, dance, [[musical theatre]], [[pantomime]], comedy, drama, children's shows and concerts.  The theatre is staffed by a small full-time technical crew for all the backstage work, setting up all the shows and artists that appear. Volunteers from the local community are also employed for front-of-house duties including bar work and as ushers.

By the 1990s, more work was needed to repair and modernise the theatre, and from 1999 to 2001 an extensive programme of internal and external restoration took place.  In February 2007, another refurbishment was completed at the Opera House that saw the installation of air conditioning in the gallery and backstage area, new seats in the gallery and upper circle, a new get-in lift to replace the ramp and new backstage working lights as well as re-wiring and painting the backstage area and dressing rooms.  The current capacity is 902 seats.&lt;ref name=PAC/&gt;

In 2011, ''[[FT Magazine]]'' featured an article on opera house design.  In the section called "My favourite experiences", the writer praised the European opera houses "designed by the Viennese architectural firm of Fellner and Helmer (the [[Zurich Opera House]] is [an] example) ... [which] represent a near-ideal marriage of size, acoustic and decorative beauty. Their British equivalents are those designed by [[Frank Matcham]] – best of all the Buxton Opera House."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Andrew. [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/793470dc-faa5-11e0-8fe7-00144feab49a.html#axzz1bf0DIXqA "Something completely magical: My favourite opera experiences",] ''FT Magazine'', 21 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre complex==
The theatre complex also includes the adjacent Pavilion Gardens, the 369-seat Pavilion Arts Centre (rebuilt in 2010; formerly the Paxton Theatre),&lt;ref name=PAC&gt;Woolman, Natalie. [http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/29520/buxton-opera-house-to-open-new-pavilion-arts "Buxton Opera House to open new Pavilion arts venue"]. ''The Stage'', 7 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the Octagon Hall auditorium (built in 1875), as well as a two-storey restaurant with a bar and gift shop.  The arts centre stage area can be converted into a separate 93-seat studio theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://derbyshire.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/the-opening-of-the-pavilion-art-centre-buxton-derbyshire-24528/ "The opening of the Pavilion art centre Buxton"]. ''Derbyshire Life'', 26 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
Since July 1979, the Opera House and theatre complex has been home to the [[Buxton Festival]], which runs for about two weeks in mid-July and has developed into one of Britain's largest opera-based festivals.  Typically, it includes a [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] opera (with conductors such as Harry Christophers) and other rarely seen operas as well as more popular classics.  Running alongside it is the [[Buxton Festival Fringe]].  It is popular as a warm-up for the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and it now claims to be the largest 'true' fringe festival in the UK.  From 1994 to 2013, the Opera House also hosted the annual three-week-long [[International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival]], attracting audiences from all over the UK and from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Rupert. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/10176800/Gilbert-and-Sullivan-Festival-bows-out-of-Buxton.html "Gilbert and Sullivan Festival bows out of Buxton"], ''The Telegraph'', 15 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opera House presents over 400 performances each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laughingaudience.co.uk/buxton-opera-house.html "Buxton Opera House"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Paul Iles &amp; The Laughing Audience, accessed 18 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004, the Opera House and the neighbouring Pavilion Gardens have hosted the annual Four Four Time music festival which sees a wide variety of musical performances over one week in February.  Performers for the 2008 festival included [[Marc Almond]], [[Richard Hawley]], [[The Stranglers]] and [[Boy George]].

The '''Canadian Tulip Festival''' ({{lang-fr|Festival Canadien des Tulipes}}; {{lang-nl|Canadees Festival van de Tulp}}) is a [[tulip festival]], held annually in May in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada. The festival claims to be the world's largest tulip festival, displaying over one million [[tulip]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |format=PDF |url=http://festivaldestulipes.ca/TulipTimeWeb2010.pdf |title=Tulip Times |page=4 |accessdate=October 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601213845/http://festivaldestulipes.ca/TulipTimeWeb2010.pdf |archivedate=June 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with attendance of over 650,000 visitors annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large displays of tulips are planted throughout the city, and the largest display of tulips is found in [[Commissioners Park (Ottawa)|Commissioners Park]] on the shores of [[Dow's Lake]], and along the [[Rideau Canal]] with 300,000 tulips planted there alone.&lt;ref&gt;NCC&lt;/ref&gt;  Millions of tulips set the stage for a celebration of authentic art, cultural, historic, culinary and family tulip experiences at various official venues across the capital.

== History ==
In 1945, the [[Dutch royal family]] sent 100,000 [[tulip]] bulbs to [[Ottawa]] in gratitude for Canadians having sheltered the future [[Queen Juliana]] and her family for the preceding three years during the [[Nazi occupation of the Netherlands]] in the [[Second World War]]. The most noteworthy event during their time in Canada was the birth in 1943 of [[Princess Margriet]] at the [[The Ottawa Hospital|Ottawa Civic Hospital]]. The maternity ward was temporarily declared to be extraterritorial by the Canadian government, thereby allowing Princess Margriet's citizenship to be solely influenced by her mother's Dutch citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Proclamation|url = http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=9450&amp;f=g|publisher = ''[[Canada Gazette]]''|date = 26 December 1942|accessdate = 18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1943: Netherlands’ Princess Margriet born in Ottawa - CBC Archives|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1943-netherlands-princess-margriet-born-in-ottawa|website=CBC Archives|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=23 January 1992|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Juliana sent another 20,500 bulbs requesting that a display be created for the hospital, and promised to send 10,000 more bulbs each year.

=== The festival begins ===
[[File:Her Royal Highness Princess Margriet of the Netherlands in Ottawa.jpg|thumb|Princess Margriet returns to Ottawa to attend the Canadian Tulip Festival in May 2002.]]
In the years following Queen Juliana's original donation, Ottawa became famous for its tulips and in 1953 the [[Ottawa Board of Trade]] and photographer [[Malak Karsh]] organized the first "Canadian Tulip Festival". Queen Juliana returned to celebrate the festival in 1967, and Princess Margriet returned in 2002 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the festival.

=== Outdoor music concerts ===
For many years, the festival featured a series of outdoor [[music]] concerts in addition to the tulips.
The 1972 festival saw [[Liberace]] give an opening concert, and at the 1987 festival, Canadian singer [[Alanis Morissette]] made her first appearance at the age of 12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulipfestival.ca/en/Education/E-History_of_CTF.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301021413/http://www.tulipfestival.ca/en/Education/E-History_of_CTF.pdf |date=March 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Trews]] first became widely known after opening for [[Big Sugar]] at the 2003 festival. Montreal's [[General Rudie]] also gained valuable exposure early in their career with a performance at the 2000 festival.

After several years of cold and rainy weekends drove the festival to the brink of bankruptcy in 2006, the outdoor music concerts were discontinued.  Even though concert admission fees were a source of revenue for the festival, rainy weather contributed to low concert attendance on many occasions, making the concerts a heavy financial risk.

=== 2007: Reorganisation ===
In 2007, the festival was reorganised under new leadership. The festival was redesigned to focus on promoting international friendship, the original symbolic role of the gift of tulips. Park admission charges were eliminated and a new feature called ''Celebr'''idée''': a Celebration of Ideas'' was introduced.  Another component of the 2007 festival was a fund-raising effort in support of [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] Canada.

=== Celebridée ===
Beyond celebrating the tulip as a symbol of beauty and friendship, the Canadian Tulip Festival, through Celebridée, aims to present some of the most brilliant thinkers of our time speaking about ideas that matter. 
	
Celebridée has continued to grow since its inception in 2007. 2008's speakers included such diverse and thought-provoking individuals as Sir [[Salman Rushdie]], Wired Magazine's [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]'' [[Jared Diamond]], and world-renowned pianist [[Angela Hewitt]].

==Trivia==
Because of the ongoing Canadian support for the Netherlands during the war, Seymour Cobley of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] actually donated 83,000 tulips to Canada from 1941&amp;ndash;1943, several years before the Royal Family followed suit.&lt;ref name="godutch"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.godutch.com/windmill/newsItem.asp?id=166 |title=Crown princess Juliana in 1945 said thanks with loads of tulips |work=The Windmill news articles |publisher=goDutch |date=1943-01-19 |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographer [[Malak Karsh]] became widely known for his photographs of the Tulip Festival.

While the Netherlands continues to send 20,000 bulbs to Canada each year (10,000 from the Royal Family and 10,000 from the Dutch Bulb Growers Association), by 1963 the festival featured more than 2 million, and today sees nearly 3 million tulips purchased from Dutch and Canadian distributors.&lt;ref name="godutch"/&gt;

The '''Carinthian Peasant Revolt''' ({{lang-de|Kärntner Bauernaufstand}}; {{lang-sl|koroški kmečki upor}}) took place in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] (present-day [[Austria]]) in 1478. It was the first of several larger [[peasant revolt]]s in the area of [[Inner Austria]]. After several [[Ottoman Wars in Europe|Ottoman]] raids from 1473 onwards, the rural population established a peasants' association that was an effort to take the defence of the farmers' homes into their own hands and was also aimed against the ruling nobility that had failed to protect the farmers from attacks by marauding Turkish [[akinji]] cavalry. The revolt was eventually suppressed.&lt;ref name="Cvirn2000"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ilustrirana zgodovina Slovencev |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Illustrated History of the Slovenes |chapter=Kmečki upor na slovenskem Koroškem |trans-chapter=The Peasant Revolt in Slovene Carinthia |year=2000 |first=Peter |last=Štih |editor-first=Marko |editor-last=Vidic |publisher=Mladinska knjiga |isbn=86-11-15664-1 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces had entered the [[Balkan]] peninsula during the disintegration of the [[Serbian Empire]] in the 14th century. In 1389 they defeated a Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. Upon the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, Turkish troops advanced northwestwards and in 1469 reached the borders of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] entering the southeastern [[Duchy of Carniola]].

In view of the threat, the Carinthian estates had strong fortifications erected and mountain pass routes secured. The [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] administration under Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] imposed new taxes and contributions on the local population to fund the operations. Nevertheless, in late September 1473, Ottoman forces first crossed the [[Seeberg Saddle]] and plundered the [[Drava]] and [[Glan (Gurk)|Glan]] valleys. Again in 1476, they moved into Carinthia from the upper [[Sava]] valley, laid siege to the [[Arnoldstein]] monastery, moved into the [[Gail (river)|Gail]] valley and devastated the area of [[Villach]]. They set up a camp at [[Wernberg]], from where they started further raids.

==Course==
Carinthia saw five Turkish incursions into its territory between 1473 and 1483, with lots of plundering and killing at the hands of Turkish cavalry. According to the contemporary chronicler Jakob Unrest, the local nobility had no answer to the large numbers of Turkish cavalry, they moved into their fortified castles, while the clergy fortified its churches and monasteries and held out there. This left the peasants of Carinthia without any protection. Modelled on the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]], they decided to take their faith into their own hands.

On 2 February 1478, the Carinthian Peasants' League (German: ''Kärntner Bauernbund'') was formed in the [[Counts of Ortenburg|Ortenburg]] lands at [[Spittal an der Drau]] under the leadership of one Peter Wunderlich, raising some concern among the local nobility and clergy. Meanwhile, the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–79)|Ottoman–Venetian War]] raged through the [[Soča|Isonzo]] valley in the south, where the Turks unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of [[Gradisca]] and then turned northwards into the [[Julian Alps]]. In May the farmers gathered at Villach where they organized a 3,000-strong army to face the invaders. They started obstructing the steep [[Predil Pass]] route, however, a 20,000-strong Turkish contingent of professional akinji cavalry were able to remove the barriers and to abseil their horses over rocky terrain.

When on June 25 the Ottoman forces came down the mountains and neared [[Tarvisio|Tarvis]], most peasants fled overnight to protect their belongings. The next day only a small group of some 530 peasants and 70 miners from [[Bad Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] chose to make a stand against the Turks and to try to stop them at the [[Battle of Kokovo]] (Goggau) near Tarvis. About 300 men died in the futile attempt, surrounded and slain by about 20,000 akinji horsemen. The Turkish army broke through and proceeded to plunder all the way up to [[Millstatt Abbey]] and [[Gmünd, Carinthia|Gmünd]] in Upper Carinthia.

==Epilogue==
Immediately after the withdrawal of the Ottoman forces, the rest of the revolting peasants were accused of treachery and eventually put on trial for their revolt. The leader of the uprising Peter Wunderlich was captured near Gmünd, sentenced to death and publicly [[dismembered]] in [[Lendorf]]. The peasants remained hard-pressed, particularly as Emperor Frederick moreover entered into the [[Austrian–Hungarian War (1477–88)|Austrian–Hungarian War]] against King [[Matthias Corvinus]].

'''Catastrophism''' was the theory that the [[Earth]] had largely been shaped by sudden, short-lived, violent events, possibly worldwide in scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turney |first=C.S.M. |last2=Brown |first2=H. |year=2007 |title=Catastrophic early Holocene sea level rise, human migration and the Neolithic transition in Europe |journal=[[Quaternary Science Reviews]] |volume=26 |pages=2036–2041 |bibcode= 2007QSRv...26.2036T |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2007.07.003 |issue=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in contrast to [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] (sometimes described as [[gradualism]]), in which slow incremental changes, such as [[erosion]], created all the Earth's [[geology|geological]] features. Uniformitarianism held that the present was the key to the past, and that all geological processes (such as [[erosion]]) throughout the past were like those that can be observed now. Since the early disputes, a more inclusive and integrated view of geologic events has developed, in which the [[scientific consensus]] accepts that there were some catastrophic events in the geologic past, but these were explicable as extreme examples of natural processes which can occur.

Catastrophism held that [[geological epoch]]s had ended with violent and sudden natural catastrophes such as great floods and the rapid [[orogeny|formation of major mountain chains]].  Plants and animals living in the parts of the world where such events occurred were [[extinction|made extinct]], being replaced abruptly by the new forms whose fossils defined the geological strata. Some catastrophists attempted to relate at least one such change to the Biblical account of [[Noah's flood]].

The concept was first popularised by the early 19th-century French scientist [[Georges Cuvier]], who proposed that new life forms had moved in from other areas after local floods, and avoided  religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.&lt;ref name="McG 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudwick 133" /&gt;

==History==

===Geology and biblical beliefs===
{{Main article|history of geology}}
In the early development of [[geology]], efforts were made in a predominantly [[Christian]] western society to reconcile biblical narratives of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] and the [[Universal Flood Myth#Jewish|universal flood]] with new concepts about the processes which had formed the Earth. The discovery of other ancient flood myths was taken as explaining why the flood story was "stated in scientific methods with surprising frequency among the [[Greeks]]", an example being [[Plutarch]]'s account of the [[Universal Flood Myth#Ogyges|Ogygian flood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvardnb|King|1877|p=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuvier and the natural theologians===
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

The leading scientific proponent of catastrophism in the early nineteenth century was the French [[anatomist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Georges Cuvier]]. His motivation was to explain the patterns of [[extinction]] and [[faunal succession]] that he and others were observing in the [[fossil]] record. While he did speculate that the catastrophe responsible for the most recent extinctions in Eurasia might have been the result of the inundation of low-lying areas by the sea, he did not make any reference to [[Noah's flood]].&lt;ref name="McG 3"&gt;{{Harvardnb|McGowan|2001|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did he ever make any reference to divine creation as the mechanism by which repopulation occurred following the extinction event. In fact Cuvier, influenced by the ideas of the [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the intellectual climate of the [[French revolution]], avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.&lt;ref name="Rudwick 133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier also believed that the [[stratigraphic]] record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions, which he viewed as recurring natural events, amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth. This led him to believe the Earth was several million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast in Britain, where [[natural theology]] was influential during the early nineteenth century, a group of geologists including [[William Buckland]] and [[Robert Jameson]] interpreted Cuvier's work differently. Cuvier had written an introduction to a collection of his papers on fossil quadrupeds, discussing his ideas on catastrophic extinction. Jameson translated Cuvier's introduction into English, publishing it under the title ''Theory of the Earth''. He added extensive editorial notes to the translation, explicitly linking the latest of Cuvier's revolutions with the biblical flood. The resulting essay was extremely influential in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckland spent much of his early career trying to demonstrate the reality of the biblical flood using geological evidence. He frequently cited Cuvier's work, even though Cuvier had proposed an inundation of limited geographic extent and extended duration, whereas Buckland, to be consistent with the biblical account, was advocating a universal flood of short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Buckland abandoned [[flood geology]] in favor of the [[glaciation]] theory advocated by [[Louis Agassiz]], following a visit to the Alps where Agassiz demonstrated the effects of glaciation at first hand. As a result of the influence of Jameson, Buckland, and other advocates of natural theology, the nineteenth century debate over catastrophism took on much stronger religious overtones in Britain than elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rise of uniformitarianism in geology===
Uniformitarian explanations for the formation of [[sedimentary rock]] and an understanding of the immense stretch of [[geological time]], or as the concept came to be known [[deep time]], were found in the writing of [[James Hutton]], sometimes known as the father of geology, in the late 18th century. The geologist [[Charles Lyell]] built upon Hutton's ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the Earth's features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time. Lyell presented his ideas in the influential three volume work, ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', published in the 1830s, which challenged theories about geological cataclysms proposed by proponents of catastrophism like Cuvier and Buckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From around 1850 to 1980, most geologists endorsed [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] ("The present is the key to the past") and [[gradualism]] (''geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time'') and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as [[earthquakes]], [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time, played any significant role in the formation of the Earth's surface. Instead they believed that the earth had been shaped by the long term action of forces such as volcanism, earthquakes, erosion, and sedimentation, that could still be observed in action today. In part, the geologists' rejection was fostered by their impression that the catastrophists of the early nineteenth century believed that God was directly involved in determining the history of Earth. Some of the theories about Catastrophism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were connected with [[religion]] and catastrophic origins were sometimes considered [[Miracle|miraculous]] rather than natural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=174–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in uniformitarianism made the introduction of a new catastrophe theory very difficult. In 1923 [[J Harlen Bretz]] published a paper on the [[channeled scablands]] formed by glacial [[Lake Missoula]] in Washington State, USA. Bretz encountered resistance to his theories from the geology establishment of the day, kicking off an acrimonious 40 year debate. Finally in 1979 Bretz received the [[Penrose Medal]]; the [[Geological Society of America]]'s highest award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geosociety.org/awards/past.htm Penrose Medal 1979] to J Harlen Bretz, [[Geological Society of America]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Velikovsky's views===
{{Main|Velikovskyism}}
In the 1950s, [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] propounded catastrophism in several popular books. He speculated that the planet [[Venus]] is a former "[[comet]]" which was ejected from [[Jupiter]] and subsequently 3,500 years ago made two catastrophic close passes by Earth, 52 years apart, and later interacted with Mars, which then had a series of near collisions with Earth which ended in 687 BCE, before settling into its current [[orbit]]. Velikovsky used this to explain the biblical [[Ten Plagues|plague]]s of [[Egypt]], the biblical reference to the "Sun standing still" for a day (Joshua 10:12 &amp; 13, explained by changes in Earth's rotation), and the sinking of [[Atlantis]]. Scientists vigorously rejected Velikovsky's conjectures.&lt;ref name="UnMuseum"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krystek |first1=Lee |title=Venus in the Corner Pocket: The Controversial Theories of Immanuel Velikovsky |url=http://www.unmuseum.org/velikov.htm |publisher=Museum of Unnatural Mystery |accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current application==
Neocatastrophism is the explanation of sudden extinctions in the palaeontological record by high magnitude, low frequency events (such as asteroid impacts, super-volcanic eruptions, supernova gamma ray bursts, etc.), as opposed to the more prevalent [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] thought which emphasises low magnitude, high frequency events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goudie |first1=A. |year= |title=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |page=709 |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luis Alvarez impact event hypothesis===
{{Main|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event}}

Over the past 25 years, a scientifically based catastrophism has gained wide acceptance with regard to certain events in the distant past. One impetus for this change came from the publication of a historic paper by [[Walter Alvarez|Walter]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] in 1980. This paper suggested that a {{convert|10|km|mi}} [[asteroid]] [[Impact event|struck Earth]] 66 million years ago at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. The impact wiped out about 70% of all species, including the [[dinosaur]]s, leaving behind the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (K–T boundary). In 1990, a {{convert|180|km|mi}} candidate crater marking the impact was identified at [[Chicxulub Crater|Chicxulub]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of [[Mexico]].

Since then, the debate about the [[extinction]] of the dinosaurs and other [[mass extinction]] events has centered on whether the extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact, widespread volcanism (which occurred about the same time), or some other mechanism or combination. Most of the mechanisms suggested are catastrophic in nature.

The observation of the [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]] cometary collision with Jupiter illustrated that catastrophic events occur as natural events.

===Comparison with uniformitarianism===
One of the key differences between catastrophism and uniformitarianism is that uniformitarianism requires the assumption of vast timelines, whereas catastrophism does not. Today most geologists combine catastrophist and uniformitarianist standpoints, taking the view that [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] is a slow, gradual story punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected Earth and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |year=2007 |chapter=Uniformitarianism |chapterurl=http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |title=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=6th |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624122338/http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |archivedate=2006-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moon-formation===
{{Main|Giant impact theory}}
Modern theories also suggest that Earth's anomalously large [[moon]] was formed catastrophically. In a paper published in ''Icarus'' in 1975, [[William K. Hartmann]] and [[Donald R. Davis]] proposed that a catastrophic near-miss by a large [[planetesimal]] early in Earth's formation approximately 4.5 billion years ago blew out rocky debris, remelted Earth and formed the [[Moon]], thus explaining the Moon's lesser density and lack of an iron core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Gott III |first=J. R. |year=2005 |title=Where Did The Moon Come From? |journal= [[The Astronomical Journal]] |volume= 129 | issue=3 | pages= 1724–1745 |arxiv=astro-ph/0405372 |bibcode=2005AJ....129.1724B |doi=10.1086/427539 |last1=Belbruno |first2=J. Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact theory does have some faults; some computer simulations show the formation of a ring or multiple moons post impact, and elements are not quite the same between the earth and moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= |first1= |date=September 2009 |title=Moonwalk  |url=http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/webdav/site/GSL/shared/pdfs/Geoscientist/Download%20PDF%20copy%20of%20Geoscientist%2019.9%20September%202009.pdf |publisher=[[Geological Society of London]] |accessdate=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Binder |first1=A.B. |year=1974 |title=On the origin of the Moon by rotational fission |journal=[[The Moon]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=53–76 |bibcode=1974Moon...11...53B |doi=10.1007/BF01877794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Stevenson |first1=D.

{{about|the opera|the painter who is its subject|Charlotte Salomon}}
[[file:Charlotte Salomon 0929 Michelides.jpg|thumb|''Charlotte Salomon'', World Premiere at the [[Salzburg Festival]] 2014]]
'''''Charlotte Salomon''''' is an opera by [[Marc-André Dalbavie]].  The libretto is by [[Barbara Honigmann]] (portions translated into French by Johannes Honigmann) who based much of it on [[Charlotte Salomon]]'s [[autobiographical]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/posthumous|posthumous]] work ''Leben? Oder Theater?''&lt;ref name=schmid&gt;Rebecca Schmid, "Reanimating a Life and an Art Cut Short," ''New York Times'' (July 26, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  The opera was first performed at the [[Salzburg Festival]] on July 28, 2014.&lt;ref name=orf&gt;[http://oe1.orf.at/programm/378856 "Marc Andre Dalbavie: 'Charlotte Salomon'" Österreichischer Rundfunk.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition == 
The nature of ''Leben? Oder Theater?'' is of an artist fashioning her own life into an artistic creation.  Dalbavie said that the "intrinsically musical and even cinematic qualities of 'Leben? Oder Theater?'" combined with an attraction to real-life drama inspired him to compose an opera based on Charlotte Salomon.&lt;ref name=schmid/&gt;  Since Salomon was aiming for a form of communication that combined various arts, Dalbalvie felt that her story needed music. He was quoted as saying "She recreated her life through a work of art."&lt;ref name=schmid/&gt; Just as Dalbavie's opera ''Gesualdo'' (based on the life of [[Carlo Gesualdo]]) incorporates portions of his subject's compositions, so too does Dalbavie incorporate existing music into his opera, such as the "Habañera" from [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' and "Wir winden dir den Jungfernkranz" from [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]'s ''[[Der Freischütz]]''.&lt;ref name=schmid/&gt;

The opera includes a character representing the author Charlotte Salomon (speaking role), and also her fictive creation, named Charlotte Kann ([[mezzo-soprano]]).  While the opera (including the role of Charlotte Kann) is sung in French, the character named Charlotte Salomon comments on the action in German.  By the end of the opera, the languages are reversed, representing the integration of the artist her subject.&lt;ref name=schmid/&gt; 

Dalbavie's orchestrations derives from his analysis of the human voice's acoustic frequencies, a technique used in [[spectral music]] as well as alluding to a singing teacher's character in the opera.&lt;ref name=schmid/&gt;  Dalbavie described the scoring of the opera—for 65 orchestral musicians (the size of the Salzburg Mozarteum Orchestra)—as one designed not as much for dramatic impact as for "maximum tonal richness."&lt;ref name=orf/&gt;

== Premiere ==
''Charlotte Salomon'' is in two acts and an epilogue. It was first performed at the [[Salzburg Festival]] on July 28, 2014, where it was directed by [[Luc Bondy]]. The production involved twenty projections of Salomon's artwork.&lt;ref name=orf/&gt;

In [[physical cosmology]], the '''electroweak epoch''' was the period in the evolution of the early universe when the temperature of the universe had fallen enough that the [[strong force]] separated from the [[electroweak]] interaction, but was high enough for [[electromagnetism]] and the [[weak interaction]] to remain merged into a single [[electroweak interaction]] (above energies of about 246&amp;nbsp;[[GeV]]&lt;!-- IF THIS IS CHANGED, PLEASE ALSO UPDATE THE SAME INFO AT [[Chronology of the universe]], [[Electroweak scale]], [[Electroweak interaction]].

As the universe expanded and cooled, interactions became less energetic and when the universe was about 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;seconds old, W and Z bosons ceased to be created. The remaining W and Z bosons decayed quickly, and the weak interaction became a short-range force in the following [[quark epoch]].

The physics of the electroweak epoch is less speculative and much better understood than the physics of previous periods of the early universe. The existence of W, Z, and Higgs bosons has been demonstrated, and other{{Which|date=April 2012}} predictions of electroweak theory have been experimentally verified.

The '''first haircut''' for a human has special significance in certain cultures and religions.  It can be considered a [[rite of passage]] or a [[milestone]].

==Indian babies==

===Hindu babies===
{{Main|Chudakarana}}

In [[Hindu]] tradition, the hair from birth is associated with undesirable traits from past lives. Thus at the time of the [[Mundan ceremony|mundan]], the child is freshly shaven to signify freedom from the past and moving into the future. It is also said that the shaving of the hair stimulates proper growth of the brain and nerves, and that the [[sikha]], a tuft at the crown of the head, protects the memory.&lt;ref&gt;It is believed to wash away bad karma and give the recipient good karma and a better life than their previous life, from [http://hinducouncil.net/index.php/religion Hindu Council UK] web page on the mundan ceremony&lt;/ref&gt; hours 

[[Hindus]] practice a variety of rituals from birth to death. Collectively these are known as ''[[saṃskāra]]s'', meaning rites of purification, and are believed to make the body pure and fit for worship.  A boy's first haircut, known as ''choula'', is one such samskara and is considered an event of great auspiciousness. The lawbooks or ''smritis'' prescribe that a boy must have his haircut in his first or third year.  While complete [[tonsure]] is common, some Hindus prefer to leave some hair on the head, distinguishing this rite from the inauspicious tonsure that occurs upon the death of a parent.  Those that practice complete tonsure generally ritually offer the hair to their family deity. Many travel to temples such as the famed [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]] of Lord [[Vishnu]] to perform this ceremony.

Traditionally, a Hindu girl never has her hair cut after the first haircut which generally happens at the age of 11 months; So the first haircut for the girl is very important because that is the only time they do. However, some Hindus practice a tonsure ceremony for girls as well. The details vary by sect, locality, family, and country.

And also old timer Hindu people said that a newborn baby should bald their hair as cannot be with newborn hair for so long as it was a sign of a bad luck. Most of the people will bald their babies hair in the age of 3-5 months and Hindu also follow odd months to do.(Revathy)

In some Brahmin households, a baby girl's hair is never shaved.

===Maliku babies===
At the twentieth day from birth, [[Minicoy Island|Maliku]] babies' heads are shaven and the hair is weighed against gold or silver, which is given to the poor. The ceremony is called ''boabeylun''.

==Mongolian babies==
Mongolian children get their first haircut in early ages between 2-5.  Depending on the lunar calendar, boys receive their first hair cut in their even year and girls in odd year. The ritual of cutting the first hair is called Daah' Urgeeh. It is a big occasion for a whole family when guests are invited. Each guest cuts a strand of hair, saying his wishes to the child, and gives a gift.

==Orthodox Jews==

===Orthodox boys===
{{Main|Upsherin}}

Many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] Jewish boys get their first haircut when they are three years old. The hair-cutting ceremony is known in [[Yiddish]] as the ''upsherenish'' or ''[[upsherin]]'' (shear off), and in Hebrew "halaqah" (smoothing).

In [[Israel]], there are also non-religious families who adhere to this custom and do not cut their sons' hair until the age of three. A mass hair cutting ceremony is held on the holiday of [[Lag Ba'omer]] at the tomb of Rabbi [[Simeon bar Yohai]] in the [[Galilee|Galilean]] town of [[Meron (Israel)|Meron]].

==Slavic culture==

===Polish===

The ritual first haircut ({{lang-pl|postrzyżyny}}) was a pre-Christian, all-Slavic tradition, though it survived in Poland well into the 18th century. This first haircut traditionally took place between the ages of 7 and 10, and was conducted by either the boy's father or a stranger, who would thus enter into the boy's family.&lt;ref name="leciejewicz-303"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author1=Zbigniew Bukowski |editor=Lech Leciejewicz |encyclopedia=Mały słownik kultury dawnych Słowian |title=Postrzyżyny |url= |edition=2 |year=1988 |publisher=Wiedza Powszechna |volume= |location=Warsaw |isbn=8321404995 |page=303 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that age the boy's life was connected to his mother and he was treated as a child. The ritual haircut, coupled with the granting of an additional given name (usually the third), marked the boy's coming of age and a transition to the world of men, in which he was to be looked after by his father.&lt;ref name="kostrzewski-419"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Józef Kostrzewski |coauthors= |editor1= |others= |title=Kultura prapolska |trans-title=Ancient Polish culture |url= |edition=3 |series= |volume= |year=1962 |publisher=[[Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe]] |location=Warsaw |id=PB 1008/63 |oclc= |page=303 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual also constituted the father's formal act of recognition of the boy as a son.&lt;ref name="kostrzewski-419"/&gt;

===Ukrainian===
[[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] babies often have their hair cut on their first birthday as part of the ancient ''Postryzhennya'' custom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.prodigy.net/l.hodges/haircut.htm ''Postryzhennya'' - The Haircutting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217135301/http://pages.prodigy.net/l.hodges/haircut.htm |date=2005-12-17 }} there are doubts on the reliability of the source&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polynesian boys==
In [[Cook Islands]] tradition, the haircutting ceremony is a rite of passage for young boys. At these large gatherings the boy sits on a chair draped with ''[[tivaivai|tīvaevae]]'' (quilts). As his hair is cut, members of the community plaster the boy with money or other gifts. The custom serves to maintain reciprocal ties within the extended family and community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/cook-islanders/2/3 Cook Islanders - Haircutting ceremony, Porirua - Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, [[Niue]]an boys do not cut their hair, which is lovingly cared for by sisters, mothers and fathers . When the boys become teenagers, a ceremony is held where women tend the hair for the last time before it is cut. Members of the extended family plaster the youth with banknotes – all part of a large informal Niuean economy that links families and ensures the community looks after its own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/niueans/1/6 Niueans - A young Niuean at his hair-cutting ceremony - Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt;

==North American babies==
===Native American babies===
Some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes commemorated the first haircut with a ritualistic dance.  The [[Apache]] tribe had a springtime ritual.

===African Caribbean boys===
Within the [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|African Caribbean]] community this is performed once the child begins to speak clearly or after the child reaches two. This is usually done in a barbershop or carried out by the parent.

==Yazidi boys==
In the [[Yazidi]] tradition (mainly in Iran), the ''bisk'' ceremony involves cutting of a baby boy's two or three first locks, according to old traditions by his 40th day after birth to be given to the family's [[shaikh]] and [[Islam Pir|pir]], but in modern practice at 7 to 11 months, and kept by the family. The bisk ceremony is regarded as the central initiatory ritual by most Yazidis from Turkey, Armenia. and Syria. In the European Diaspora, the term is often translated as ''baptism.'' The ceremony is reminiscent of the [[Muslim]] [['aqiqa]] celebrated on the seventh day after birth, but the Yazidi ceremony takes place at a later stage, when the child has already been named.

The '''Heart of Europe Bio-Crystallography Meeting''' (short '''HEC-Meeting''') is an annual [[academic conference]] on [[structural biology]], in particular [[protein crystallography]]. Researchers from universities, other research institutions and industry from [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]] and [[Poland]] meet to present and discuss current topics of their research. The talks are predominantly given by PhD students (doctoral students). An exception is the invited HEC lecture, which is held by a renowned scientist of the research field. The format of the HEC meeting has been adopted from the eleven years older [http://regiomeeting.eu/ Rhine-Knee Regional Meeting on Structural Biology].

== History of the HEC-Meeting ==
The HEC-Meeting dates back to an initiative in the year 1998 of Manfred Weiss and Rolf Hilgenfeld, who were researchers at the Institute for Molecular Biotechnology (IMB) in [[Jena]] and intended to establish a meeting format similar to the [http://regiomeeting.eu/ Rhine-Knee Regional Meeting on Structural Biology] in the [[New states of Germany|New Länder]].&lt;ref&gt;Mariusz Jaskolski und Michal M. Sikorski: ''15 Years of Heart of Europe bio-Crystallography Meetings – Reminiscences.'' Poznan 2013, {{ISBN|978-83-927740-1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both conferences are regional meetings of German scientists together with scientific research groups of the neighbouring countries. Nine groups from Germany (the new states and West-Berlin), Poland and Czech Republic participated in the first HEC-Meeting from 8 to 10 October 1998. Later also groups from Austria and the Old Federal States participated.

In 1868, the [[USA Democrats|Democrats]] nominated former [[New York Governor]] [[Horatio Seymour]] for [[POTUS|President]] and [[Francis Preston Blair Jr.]] (a [[U.S. House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[Missouri]]) for [[VPOTUS|Vice President]].&lt;ref name="harpweek1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.harpweek.com/1868/Overview-1868-2.htm |title=HarpWeek &amp;#124; Elections &amp;#124; 1868 Overview (Page 2)|publisher=Elections.harpweek.com |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seymour-Blair ticket ran on a platform which supported national reconciliation and [[states' rights]], opposed [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]], and opposed both Black equality and Black suffrage. Meanwhile, the Republican presidential ticket led by General Ulysses S. Grant benefited from Grant's status as a war hero (for winning the American Civil War) and ran on a pro-Reconstruction (and pro-Fourteenth Amendment) platform. Ultimately, the Seymour-Blair ticket ended up losing to the Republican ticket of [[U.S. General|General]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[House Speaker]] [[Schuyler Colfax]] in the [[1868 U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt;

==Background==

[[File:ElectoralCollege1868.svg|thumb|left|200px|A map of the results of the 1868 U.S. presidential election. In this election, Grant decisively won the electoral vote.]]
The 1868 election occurred three years after the end of the [[American Civil War]] and less than a year after [[POTUS|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]]'s [[Andrew Johnson's impeachment|impeachment]] (Johnson failed to get convicted by one vote).&lt;ref name="harpweek2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.harpweek.com/1868/Overview-1868-1.htm |title=HarpWeek &amp;#124; Elections &amp;#124; 1868 Overview (Page 1)|publisher=Elections.harpweek.com |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, during the 1868 campaign season, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was ratified in order to secure basic rights for newly freed African-Americans.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; Some controversy was generated due to the fact that the [[GOP|Republican]] [[U.S. Congress]] made ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment a precondition for the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states to rejoin the Union.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt;

==The run-up to the 1868 Democratic National Convention==
After the 1866 elections, some prominent Democrats considered nominating [[General]] Ulysses S. Grant as the Democratic nominee for U.S. President in 1868.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; However, this idea was dropped after Grant made it clear that he did not want to be associated with the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; The Democrats then turned to their 1864 Vice Presidential nominee and former [[Ohio]] [[Congressman]] [[George H. Pendleton]].&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; Pendleton – the initial frontrunner for the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=14402 |title=H-Net Reviews |publisher=H-net.org |date= |accessdate=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; – was a principled opponent of U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the American Civil War, was noted for his intelligence and civility, and had a lot of support in the [[Western United States]].&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; What ultimately doomed Pendleton's bid was his "soft money views" and specifically his support of printing more money in order to spur inflation so that debtors can have some relief.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; Thus, some Democrats searched for a "hard money" alternative (specifically someone who supported the [[gold standard]]) to Pendleton – with Indiana Senator [[Thomas A. Hendricks]] being a possible contender for this role.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt;

Another prominent candidate for the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination was [[United States Chief Justice|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]].&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; While Chase won the support of Democrats such as Congressmen [[S. S. "Sunset" Cox]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Daniel W. Voorhees|Daniel Voorhees]] of [[Indiana]], what ultimately doomed his bid was his support of [[Black suffrage|Black manhood suffrage]] and other basic rights for [[African-Americans]].&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; Other Democratic presidential candidates in 1868 included Senator [[James Rood Doolittle|James Doolittle]] of [[Wisconsin]], [[Governor]] [[Joel Parker]] of [[New Jersey]], [[Governor]] [[James E. English|James English]] of [[Connecticut]], General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]] of [[Pennsylvania]] (who ultimately ended up becoming the Democratic presidential nominee in [[United States presidential election, 1880|1880]]), former [[Lieutenant Governor]] [[Sanford Church]] of New York, and former Congressman and [[railroad]] president [[Asa Packer]] of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; In addition, incumbent U.S. President Andrew Johnson attempted to secure conservative support for getting the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; However, many of President Johnson's initial supporters abandoned him as a result of his 1868 impeachment.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt;

==The 1868 Democratic National Convention==
On July 4, 1868, the [[1868 Democratic National Convention]] opened in the new [[Tammany Hall]] building in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; New York Governor Horatio Seymour, who first supported Thomas A. Hendricks and then Salmon P. Chase for the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination,&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; was selected as the chairman of this convention.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; The 1868 Democratic Party platform accepted the demise of both [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|slavery]] and [[secession]], but also demanded the end of Reconstruction by calling for the return of authority to the states, the non-renewal of the [[Freedmen’s Bureau]], [[Pardons for ex-Confederates|amnesty for all former Confederates]], and the withdrawal of the [[U.S. military]] from the [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; The platform also accused the Republicans – "the Radical party" – of violating the constitutional rights of the Southern states and of subjecting them to "military despotism and Negro supremacy."&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt;

On the first ballot, George Pendleton led with 105 votes to President Johnson's 65, Sanford Church's 34, and General Hancock's 33.5.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; For the next several ballots, Pendleton increased his support among the delegates while Hancock moved into a distant second place and while Hendricks moved into third place.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; Meanwhile, support for President Johnson dwindled until it disappeared on the 14th ballot.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; On the seventh and eighth ballots, Pendleton peaked at 156.5 delegates – which caused New York's delegation to switch their support from favorite son Sanford Church to Thomas Hendricks.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; As Pendleton's support collapsed, Hendricks took the lead for a while but was unable to sustain it after General Winfield Scott Hancock's home state of Pennsylvania added its delegates to his column – thus allowing Hancock to overtake Hendricks and to take the lead for the first time.&lt;ref name="harpweek2"/&gt; Ultimately, Hancock led through the 21st ballot.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; Meanwhile, Salmon Chase’s name was put into nomination on the 17th ballot and George Pendleton’s name was withdrawn on the 18th ballot.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt;

On the 22nd ballot, General [[George McCook]] nominated former New York Governor Horatio Seymour, causing spontaneous cheering and demonstrations of approval.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; Seymour did not want the nomination and thus declined it, but the delegates unanimously nominated him anyway.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; For Seymour's running mate, the delegates unanimously voted for Missouri Congressman [[Francis Preston Blair Jr.]] (also known as Frank Blair Jr.).&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt;

==Campaign==
The 1868 Republican presidential nominee, General Ulysses S. Grant, did not openly campaign and instead left the job to surrogates.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; Grant's surrogates gave stump [[speeches]], circulated campaign [[pamphlets]] and political broadsides, rallied the voters with [[barbecues]] and torchlight [[parades]], and organized into pro-Grant clubs like the Tanners and the Boys in Blue.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; The Republicans based their campaign on being the party that saved the Union, ended slavery, and began reforming the South.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; They argued that the election of a Democratic President would result in gridlock which would hamper [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; Meanwhile, the Democrats argued that Republicans were in favor of Black equality or even Black superiority not only in the Southern U.S., but throughout the entire United States.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; They also attacked the Republican-backed military rule in the Southern U.S. and argued that they were the only truly national party and thus the only party that could bring national reconciliation.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; The Democrats also attacked Grant as being "a besotted, uncouth, simple-minded, unprincipled, Negro-loving tyrant."&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt;

As a result of the Democrats' feeling of hopelessness, Horatio Seymour--the 1868 Democratic presidential nominee – engaged in a speaking tour near the end of the 1868 campaign.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; On October 21, Seymour spoke in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and later traveled to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Cleveland]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Detroit]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; However, the lackluster tone and repetitiveness of Seymour's speeches did not help his case (though these speeches were praised by Democratic [[newspapers]]) and it also did not help Seymour that his running mate Blair was a loose cannon who made various [[gaffes]] – such as predicting that a Grant Presidency would transform the U.S. into a military dictatorship.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abrahamlincolncartoons.info/SubPages/Biography.php?UniqueID=8 |title=HarpWeek &amp;#124; Abraham Lincoln Cartoons |publisher=Abrahamlincolncartoons.info |date= |accessdate=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
In the U.S. presidential election on November 3, 1868, Ulysses S. Grant defeated Horatio Seymour in the popular vote by a 53% to 47% margin and in the electoral vote by a margin of 214 to 80.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; 78% of the American electorate participated in this election – including 500,000 African-American men who voted for the first time in this election.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; While Seymour lost the election, there were some bright spots for him.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; Specifically, he won New Jersey, New York and [[Oregon]] and almost won [[California]].&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; In addition, Seymour won [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], and [[Delaware]].&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; In addition, it is worth noting that Grant only managed to win the popular vote in 1868 as a result of Black suffrage.&lt;ref name="worldhistory1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://worldhistory.us/american-history/ulysses-s-grant-elected-in-1868-thanks-to-black-suffrage-in-the-south.php |title=Ulysses S. Grant Elected in 1868 Thanks to Black Suffrage in the South &amp;#124; World History |publisher=Worldhistory.us |date=July 4, 2017 |accessdate=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Paul F. Boller, Jr. wrote that "[i]t is apparent that if [Grant] had not won the 450,000 to 500,000 votes cast by the freedmen in the Southern states under military occupation, he would not have won his popular majority."&lt;ref name="worldhistory1"/&gt;

In spite of the fact that Grant won the 1868 election, the Republicans largely lost interest in Reconstruction within the next several years – thus paving the way for the eventual emergence of the [[Jim Crow]] South.&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; On the bright side, the Republicans' victory (with the help of African-American voters) in 1868 motivated them to pass and ratify the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] which forbade discrimination in regards to the suffrage based on race, color, or former condition of servitude (though this Amendment was later largely circumvented in the former Confederate states through things such as [[poll taxes]] (including [[grandfather clauses]]) and [[literacy tests]]).&lt;ref name="harpweek1"/&gt; This is a notable development since, just a couple of years earlier, Republicans had refused to guarantee African-American suffrage in the Fourteenth Amendment due to their belief and fear that this will prevent the Fourteenth Amendment from being ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Raoul Berger |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/berger-government-by-judiciary-the-transformation-of-the-fourteenth-amendment |title=Government by Judiciary: The Transformation of the Fourteenth Amendment - Online Library of Liberty |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth (1912).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|''Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth'']]

'''''Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth''''' (''The Loves of Queen Elizabeth''), '''''Les Amours d'Elisabeth, Reine d'Angleterre''''' (''The Loves of Elizabeth, Queen of England'') or '''''La reine Élisabeth''''' (''Queen Elizabeth'') is a 1912 feature 4-reel [[Cinema of France|French]] [[silent film]] based on the love affair between [[Elizabeth I of England]] and the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].  It was condensed from a play of the same name and directed by [[Louis Mercanton]] and [[Henri Desfontaines]]. It was shot in [[Paris]] and starred [[Sarah Bernhardt]] as Elizabeth and [[Lou Tellegen]] as Essex. Bernhardt by then was 68 and said of the film "This is my last chance at immortality". She and Tellegen were already romantically involved, and this was their second film together.

Its production company, L’Histrionic Film, was forced into liquidation by [[Pathé|Pathé Frères]] during the film's production, but it was completed with funds from [[Adolph Zukor]]. Zukor also brought it to [[New York City]], where it premiered at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]] on Broadway. The film’s US release (on State Rights basis, on 12 July 1912) was the first release from the [[Famous Players Film Company]]. Its success convinced other American companies that feature films were commercially viable. Famous Players, which advertised "Famous Players in Famous Plays", later became [[Famous Players-Lasky]], and then [[Paramount Pictures]].

''Queen Elizabeth'' had one of the earliest dedicated [[film score]]s, composed by [[Joseph Carl Breil]] specifically for the production. Four years earlier, Bernhardt’s first film ''[[The Assassination of the Duke of Guise]]'' (1908), also featured an original film score, one composed by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]].&lt;ref name="davis-17"&gt;[[Richard Davis (composer)|Davis, Richard]] (1999).

'''Melodifestivalen 2015''' was the [[Sweden|Swedish]] music competition that selected [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015|Sweden's 55th entry]] for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/83858/sweden-svt-confirms-participation-eurovision-2015/|title=Eurovision Sweden: SVT confirms participation in Eurovision 2015|work=esctoday.com|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Måns Zelmerlöw]] won with the song "[[Heroes (Måns Zelmerlöw song)|Heroes]]". The hosts for the show were [[Sanna Nielsen]] (winner of [[Melodifestivalen 2014]]) and comedian [[Robin Paulsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/det-har-ar-sanna-nielsen-och-robin-paulsson-programledare-for-melodifestivalen-2015|title=Sanna Nielsen och Robin Paulsson – programledare för Melodifestivalen 2015|work=svt.se|accessdate=29 September 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dagensmedia.se/nyheter/tv/article3851336.ece|title=Sanna Nielsen och Robin Paulsson leder Melodifestivalen|work=Dagens Media|accessdate=29 September 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the fourteenth consecutive year, the competition consisted of four semi-finals, a "Second Chance" round, and a final. However, the total number of competing entries was reduced from 32 to 28. The 28 competing entries were divided into four semi-finals, with seven compositions in each. From each semifinal, the songs that earned first and second place went directly to the final, while the songs that placed third and fourth proceeded to the Second Chance semi-final. The bottom three songs in each semifinal were eliminated from the competition.&lt;ref name="Eurovision.tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=a_bigger_final_for_swedens_melodifestivalen|title=Sweden's Melodifestivalen dates, changes and presenters announced|date=29 September 2014|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331164404/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=a_bigger_final_for_swedens_melodifestivalen|archivedate=31 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new rule for the 2015 edition of the competition stipulated that at least 50% of the selected entries were to be written by female composers or lyricists in a full or partial capacity.&lt;ref name="Inbjudan 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nu är det dags att skriva låtar till Melodifestivalen 2015|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/nu-ar-det-dags-att-skriva-latar-till-melodifestivalen-2015|publisher=Sveriges Television|accessdate=14 March 2015|date=24 June 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Svensktoppen nästa info"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rekordmånga låtar tävlar i Svensktoppen nästa |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=3147&amp;artikel=5831725 |publisher=Sveriges Radio |accessdate=14 March 2015 |date=8 April 2014 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513011518/http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=3147&amp;artikel=5831725 |archivedate=13 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Chance ==

The Second Chance ''(Andra chansen)'' round was held on 7 March 2015 in [[Helsingborg Arena]], [[Helsingborg]]. Unlike in the previous editions, four out of eight competing entries were sent to the final this year. The preliminary two-phase voting introduced in 2013 was eliminated, bringing a duel-only competition back. The duels are as follows:

It was announced that [[Malena Ernman]], Melodifestivalen [[Melodifestivalen 2009|winner]] and [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009|Sweden's representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 Eurovision Song Contest]] would join [[Behrang Miri]] and Victor Crone on stage to do the opera vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweden: Former winners return to Melodifestivalen for Andra chansen|url=http://escxtra.com/2015/03/04/former-winners-return-to-melodifestivalen-for-andra-chansen/|website=escxtra.com|publisher=escXtra.com|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot synopsis==
Sopho returns from America, where she had been for the last twelve years, for the death anniversary of her husband. She finds that her school friend, Shoka, is pregnant. Moreover, it turns out that her husband, Chito, had not died. He married Shoka and his tombstone in their yard was just a means of extorting money from Sopho.

The husband, friend and even her son (Toko) had to cheat Sopho to take money from her and pay for the interest for the apartment, which they had put in the bank.

They were alarmed by Sopho's unexpected arrival.

Sopho decides not to go to America, although her son Toko manages to bring to Georgia old Baxter, whom his mother was taking care in the States. He wants his mother to take care of him in Georgia, so as not to lose money.

Sopho refuses to look after Baxter and makes her family members care for him. Baxter, in this way "punishes" idlers - Chito, Shoka and Toko.

Baxter intends to propose to Sopho, but since she was supporting the idlers he concludes that she was like them.

In the final scene the persons are close to the Celestial Court. Their roles change - Sopho and Baxter care for Chito, Shoka and Toko who are confined to invalid chairs.

Baxter O'Sullivan names Sopho as "My redbreast" and from here occurs play heading.

'''Myndus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɪ|n|d|ə|s}}) or '''Myndos''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Μύνδος}}}}) was an ancient [[Dorians|Dorian]] colony of [[Troezen]], on the coast of [[Caria]] in [[Asia Minor]], ([[Turkey]]), sited on the [[Bodrum]] Peninsula, a few miles northwest of [[Halicarnassus]]. The site is now occupied by the modern village of [[Gümüslük]].

==History==
Myndos was protected by strong walls, and had a good harbor. ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Paus.]] ii. 30. § 8; [[Strabo]] xiv. p.&amp;nbsp;658; [[Arrian]], Anab. i. 20, ii. 5.)  Otherwise, the place is not of much importance in ancient history. Both [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (v. 29) and [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] (''s. v.'') mention [[Palaemyndus]] as an ancient Carian settlement near to Myndus, which seems to have become deserted after Dorian Mynduse was founded. (Comp. Strab. xiii. p.&amp;nbsp;611).  [[Mela]] (i. 16) and Pliny (''l. c.'') also speak of a place called ''Neapolis'' in the same peninsula and as no other authors mention such a place in that part of the country, it has been supposed that Myndus (the Dorian colony) and Neapolis were the same place. Pliny, however, mentions both Myndus and Neapolis as two different towns.

The [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic philosopher]] [[Diogenes of Sinope]] visited Myndos and noticed how large the city gates were, relative to the town; he cynically remarked; "Oh men of Myndos, I urge you to shut the city gates, as your town might exit from these!".

Myndian ships are mentioned in the expedition of Anaxagoras against Naxos. (Herod. v. 33.) [[Herodotus]] relates the story of how a captain from Myndus, Scylax, was found to have left no guards on his ship while a Persian force was preparing to attack the island of [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]]. The Persian commander, [[Megabates]], flew into a rage and had him put in stocks, at which point [[Aristagoras]], a [[tyrant]] from [[Miletus]] helping several Naxian oligarchs to retake Naxos, discovered what had happened to his guest-friend Scylax. Pleading with Megabates to no avail for Scylax, he released him anyway, incurring the Persian commander's wrath. The consequence of this falling out was that, according to Herodotus, Megabates warned the Naxians of what was afoot, ruining the expedition and in turn Aristagoras who, with nowhere to go, stirred up the [[Ionian Revolt]]. This is a classic example of Ionian αταξιη (lack of discipline, disorder, licentiousness), a charge commonly levelled at them, especially in the 5th century by [[Athens]].

At a later time, when [[Alexander the Great]] besieged Halicarnassus, he was anxious first to make himself master of Myndus; but when he attempted to take it by surprise, the Myndians, with the aid of reinforcements from Halicarnassus repulsed him with some loss. (Arrian, ''l. c.''; comp. Hecat. Fragm. 229; Polyb. xvi. 15, 21; Scylax, p.&amp;nbsp;38; Ptol. v. 2. § 9; Liv. xxxvii. 15; Hierocl. p.&amp;nbsp;687.)  [[Athenaeus]] (i. 32) states that the wine grown in the district of Myndus was good for digestion.

Remains of the city are visible in and around Gümüslük and in the adjacent waters; it is supposed that some unrecorded earthquake caused seafront sections of the ancient town to be submerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Ecclesiastical history==

Myndus was an [[episcopal see]] of [[Caria]], a suffragan of [[Stauropolis]] (Aphrodisias). The ''[[Notitiæ episcopatuum]]'' allude to it as late as the 12th or 13th century. However, only four of its bishops are known: Archelaus, who attended the [[First Council of Ephesus]] (431); Alphius, who assisted at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451); John who was present at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] (680); and another John who went to the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787).&lt;ref&gt;Sophrone Pétridès, "Myndus" ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1911. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10660c.htm full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishopric is included in the [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 931&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4034">The '''Northampton Balloon Festival''' is an annual [[hot air balloon festival]] held in [[Northampton]], England.

The original festival was held in [[The Racecourse, Northampton|The Racecourse]] and managed by the Borough Council, and took place over a Friday, Saturday and Sunday in mid-August. The main features of the festival were the twice-daily [[hot air balloon]] lifts and a balloon glow, but other attractions included trade stalls, live music and arena entertainment.

==History==
The first festival was held in 1990. The start attractions were the Chubb fire extinguisher and the Rupert The Bear balloons.
In its early years The Northampton balloon was a soaring success with families encouraged to come and enjoy the weekend, looking at balloons and visiting various trade stalls across the park. 

In 2001 the festival was joined with the [[Northampton Town Show]] (previously held during July) to become the ''Northampton Festival'', but has since reverted to its original name.
Sadly the early years of the new millennium coincided with the rise of the "chav" and a growing obsession behind making money the festival became an oversized fairground full of topless louts. This was clearly the beginning of the end for what had become one of the town´s prized attractions. 

The 2004 festival featured the ''[[Sugababes]]'', ''[[Big Brovaz]]'', and [[Ronan Keating]].

The 2005 festival featured [[Rachel Stevens]] and [[Lemar]].

The 2007 festival was a disaster due to poor attendance caused by bad weather on the last two days and the fact that the council decided to charge adults for admission, which discouraged many adults without young children from attending and spending money at the stalls.

The 2008 festival was scaled down from before, with fewer stalls,
and featured [[Rick Astley]] and [[Signature (dance group)|Signature]] but neither were able to revive the festival's fortunes and the event made a huge loss.

The Borough Council ceased its funding and in mid-2009 the festival was revived by new organisers and moved to [[Billing Aquadrome]]. It took place 14–16 August 2009 at the new location with free admission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northamptonballoonfestival.net/ New Balloon Festival website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020045643/http://www.northamptonballoonfestival.net/ |date=20 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Billing-Aquadrome-39best-site-for.5327696.jp Chronicle &amp; Echo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 Northampton Balloon Festival was once again based at Billing Aquadrome, however that year the organisers chose to charge entry.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The Balloon Festival sat alongside an existing event, the American Car Show and included a variety of stalls and fairground rides.

In 2012, it was announced that Pure Leisure, the owners of Billing Aquadrome had agreed sponsorship of the event, for a further 3 years.

The Balloon Festival was held on Friday 15 to Sunday 17 August 2014, 14-16 August 2015 and between 19-21 August 2016.

==History==
The self-proclaimed version of the history of the organisation has Sokolnicki transforming the Order of Saint Stanislaus into a private charitable institution on 15 September 1990, before transferring his authority to the new Polish government of [[Lech Wałęsa]] in December of the same year.&lt;ref name=SokolnickiOrder/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution|url=http://ordo-sancti-stanislai.com/eng/theorder/constitution.html|work=Order of Saint Stainslas|publisher=Sankt Stanislaus Orden Österreich - Karitativer Ritterorden|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his death on 17 August 2009, Sokolnicki appointed Polish businessman [[Jan Zbigniew Potocki]] as his successor.&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;{{cite news|title=Zmarł samozwańczy prezydent Polski|url=http://polska.newsweek.pl/zmarl-samozwanczy-prezydent-polski,42831,1,1.html|accessdate=14 December 2012|newspaper=Newsweek (Poland)|date=26 August 2009|language=Polish|quote=W 1990 roku ogłosił się Wielkim Mistrzem Orderu Świętego Stanisława (orderu rycerskiego istniejącego w XVIII i XIX wieku) i zajął się nadawaniem go w Polsce i zagranicą.

===Succession debate===
There have been several organisations which claim to be the heirs of the Polish [[Order of Saint Stanislaus]]. Ordo Sancti Stanislai has been one of the more prominent attempts, founded (or revived) by [[Juliusz Nowina-Sokolnicki]] who claimed to be the president of the [[Polish government-in-exile]] from 1972 until the restoration of Polish democracy in 1990.&lt;ref name=Sokolnicki&gt;{{cite web|title=Sokolnicki Juliusz|url=http://www.sokolnicki.republika.pl/html/zyciorys.html|work=Juliusz Nowina Sokolnicki, Biblioteka Uniwersytecka UMK w Toruniu, Archiwum Emigracji, “Dokumenty Urzędu Prezydenta RP”|accessdate=12 December 2012|language=Polish|quote=1967-70 Minister Informacji i Dokumentacji, 1970 minister spraw wewnętrznych i minister spraw krajowych, 1971 wyznaczony na następcę prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej, 1972-90 prezydent Rzeczypospolitej.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his capacity as president, he claimed to restore the Order of Saint Stanislaus on 9 June 1979.&lt;ref name=Sokolnicki /&gt;  Sokolnicki's claim to the Polish presidency was widely rejected&lt;ref&gt;http://www.president.pl/x.node?id=436&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.senat.gov.pl/k6/dok/sten/oswiad/arciszew/2301.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sokolnicki.republika.pl/html/jns_pod.html Juliusz Nowina-Sokolnicki (1920-2009), Autor: Norbert Wójtowicz (pl)]&lt;/ref&gt; and he is not recognized by the current government of Poland (in 1990, [[Lech Wałęsa]] accepted symbols of the pre-War presidency from [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ryszard Kaczorowski|url=http://www.president.pl/en/president/polish-presidents/ryszard-kaczorowski/|work=The Official Website of the President of the Republic of Poland|publisher=BBN Biuro Bezpieczeństwa Narodowego|accessdate=30 December 2011|quote=Ryszard Kaczorowski...handed over the insignia of the presidential power of the 2nd Republic to President Lech Walesa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokolnicki's status was enhanced by the fact that he was an associate of [[August Zaleski]], generally recognized as the head of the [[Polish government-in-exile]] from 1947 to 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=August Zaleski|url=http://www.president.pl/en/president/polish-presidents/august-zaleski/|work=The Official Website of the President of Poland|publisher=Biuro Bezpieczeństwa Narodowego|accessdate=12 December 2012|location=Warsaw|quote=Having assumed the office of the President in exile (April 1947), he appointed General Tadeusz Bor-Komorowski Prime Minister.

Before his death in April 1972 he designated Stanislaw Ostrowski as his successor.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That connection gave Sokolnicki's order a veneer of legitimacy that other such endeavors lacked.

After [[Lech Wałęsa]] became [[President of Poland]] with universal recognition on 22 December 1990, the rationale for the governments in exile ended. Sokolnicki followed the path of his rival, [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]], in formally recognizing Wałęsa as his successor.&lt;ref name=Ferfecki&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferfecki|first=Wiktor|title=Zmarł samozwańczy prezydent Polski|url=http://www.tvp.info/informacje/polska/zmarl-samozwanczy-prezydent-polski|accessdate=14 December 2012|newspaper=TVP.info|date=8 August 2009|language=Polish|quote=Działał równolegle z rzeczywistymi prezydentami na uchodźstwie aż do 1990 r., gdy oficjalnie przekazał insygnia władzy prezydenckiej Lechowi Wałęsie}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Nevertheless, Sokolnicki claimed to retain the office of [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] in his Order of Saint Stanislaus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anna|first=ed. by Luigi G.

The Ordo Sancti Stanislai says of itself: "The Order of Saint Stanislas is a hierarchically organized body of men and women, many with a Polish Connection, who support and assist in charitable works of various kinds to help the poor and disadvantaged in Poland and in other countries throughout the world.

A '''photocopier''' (also known as a '''copier''' or '''copy machine''') is a [[machine]] that makes copies of documents and other visual images onto [[paper]] or [[plastic film]] quickly and cheaply. Most modern '''photocopiers''' use a technology called ''[[xerography]]'', a dry process  that uses electrostatic charges on a light-sensitive photoreceptor to first attract and then transfer toner particles (a powder) onto paper in the form of an image.  Heat, pressure or a combination of both is then used to fuse the toner onto the paper.  Copiers can also use other technologies such as [[inkjet printer|ink jet]], but xerography is standard for office copying. Earlier versions included the [[Gestetner]] stencil duplicator, invented by [[David Gestetner]] in 1881.

Commercial xerographic office photocopying was introduced by [[Xerox]] in 1959,&lt;ref name="xerox-1950s"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xerox History: 1950s|url=https://www.xerox.com/about-xerox/history-timeline/1950-decade/ensg.html|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="story-of-xerography"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of Xerography|url=https://www.xerox.com/downloads/usa/en/s/Storyofxerography.pdf|publisher=Xerox Corporation|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it gradually replaced copies made by Verifax, [[Photostat]], [[carbon paper]], [[mimeograph machine]]s, and other [[duplicating machines]].

Photocopying is widely used in the business, education, and government sectors.  While there have been predictions that photocopiers will eventually become obsolete as information workers increase their use of digital document creation, storage and distribution, and rely less on distributing actual pieces of paper, as of 2015, photocopiers continue to be widely used. In the 2010s, there is a convergence in some high-end machines between the roles of a photocopier, a [[fax]] machine, a [[Image scanner|scanner]], and a computer network-connected [[printer (computing)|printer]] into a [[multi-function printer]]. Lower-end machines that can copy and print in color have increasingly dominated the home-office market as their prices fell steadily through 2017. Higher-end color photocopiers capable of handling heavy duty cycles and large-format printing remain a costlier specialty for print and design shops.

==History==
[[Chester Carlson]], the inventor of photocopying, was originally a [[patent attorney]], as well as a part-time researcher and inventor. His job at the [[patent office]] in [[New York City|New York]] required him to make a large number of copies of important papers. Carlson, who was [[arthritis|arthritic]], found this to be a painful and tedious process. This motivated him to conduct experiments with photo conductivity. Carlson used his kitchen for his "[[electrophotography]]" experiments, and, in 1938, he applied for a patent for the process. He made the first photocopy using a [[zinc]] plate covered with [[sulfur]]. The words "10-22-38 Astoria" were written on a [[microscope]] slide, which was placed on top of more sulfur and under a bright light. After the slide was removed, a mirror image of the words remained. Carlson tried to sell his invention to some companies, but failed because the process was still underdeveloped. At the time, multiple copies were most commonly made at the point of document origination, using [[carbon paper]] or manual duplicating machines, and people did not see the need for an electronic machine. Between 1939 and 1944, Carlson was turned down by over 20 companies, including [[IBM]] and [[General Electric]]—neither of which believed there was a significant market for copiers.

In 1944, the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], a non-profit organization in [[Columbus, Ohio]], contracted with Carlson to refine his new process. Over the next five years, the institute conducted experiments to improve the process of electrophotography. In 1947, Haloid Corporation (a small New York-based manufacturer and seller of photographic paper) approached Battelle to obtain a license to develop and market a copying machine based on this technology.&lt;ref name="story-of-xerography" /&gt;

Haloid felt that the word "electrophotography" was too complicated and did not have good recall value. After consulting a professor of classical language at [[Ohio State University]], Haloid and Carlson changed the name of the process to "[[xerography]]," which was derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] words that meant "dry writing." Haloid called the new copier machines "Xerox Machines" and, in 1948, the word "Xerox" was [[trademarked]].  Haloid eventually changed its name to [[Xerox Corporation]].

{{Anchor|Xeroxing_term}} In 1949, Xerox Corporation introduced the first xerographic copier called the Model A.&lt;ref name="xerox-history-1940s"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xerox history: 1940s|url=https://www.xerox.com/about-xerox/history-timeline/1940-decade/ensg.html|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xerox became so successful that, in [[North America]], photocopying came to be popularly known as "xeroxing." Xerox has actively fought to prevent "Xerox" from becoming a [[genericized trademark]].  While the word "Xerox" has appeared in some dictionaries as a synonym for photocopying, Xerox Corporation typically requests that such entries be modified, and that people not use the term "Xerox" in this way. Some languages include hybrid terms, such as the widely used [[Polish language|Polish]] term ''kserokopia'' ("xerocopy"), even though relatively few photocopiers are of the Xerox brand.

In the early 1950s, [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) introduced a variation on the process called [[Electrofax]], whereby images are formed directly on specially coated paper and rendered with a toner dispersed in a liquid.

During the 1960s and through the 1980s, [[Savin (photocopiers)|Savin Corporation]] developed and sold a line of liquid-toner copiers that implemented a technology based on patents held by the company.

Before the widespread adoption of xerographic copiers, photo-direct copies produced by machines such as [[Kodak]]'s Verifax were used. A primary obstacle associated with the pre-xerographic copying technologies was the high cost of supplies: a Verifax print required supplies costing US$0.15 in 1969, while a Xerox print could be made for $0.03 including paper and labor. The coin-operated [[Photostat machine]]s still found in some public libraries in the late 1960s made letter-size copies for $0.25 each, at a time when the minimum wage for a US worker was $1.65 per hour; the Xerox machines that replaced them typically charged $0.10.

Xerographic copier manufacturers took advantage of a high perceived-value of the 1960s and early 1970s, and marketed paper that was "specially designed" for xerographic output. By the end of the 1970s, paper producers made xerographic "runability" one of the requirements for most of their office paper brands.

[[File:DADF (Canon IR6000).JPG|thumb|right|DADF or Duplex Automatic Document feeder - Canon IR6000]]

Some devices sold as photocopiers have replaced the drum-based process with [[inkjet]] or transfer film technology.

Among the key advantages of photocopiers over earlier copying technologies are their ability:
* to use plain (untreated) office paper,
* to implement [[Duplex printing|duplex]] (or two-sided) printing,
* Able to scan several pages automatically with an [[Automatic document feeder|ADF]], and
* eventually, to sort and/or [[staple (fastener)|staple]] output.

===Color photocopiers===
Colored toner became available in the 1950s, although full-color copiers were not commercially available until [[3M]] released the ''Color-in-Color'' copier in 1968, which used a [[dye sublimation]] process rather than conventional electrostatic technology. The first electrostatic color copier was released by Xerox (the 6500) in 1973. Color photocopying is a concern to [[government]]s, as it facilitates [[counterfeiting]] [[currency]] and other documents: for more information, see [[#Counterfeiting|Counterfeiting]] section.

===Digital technology===
There is an increasing trend for new photocopiers to adopt [[Digital data|digital]] technology, thus replacing the older [[analog signal|analog]] technology. With digital copying, the copier effectively consists of an integrated [[image scanner|scanner]] and [[laser printer]].  This design has several advantages, such as automatic image quality enhancement and the ability to "build jobs"  (that is, to scan page images independently of the process of printing them). Some digital copiers can function as high-speed scanners; such models typically offer the ability to send documents via email or to make them available on file servers.

A great advantage of digital copier technology is "automatic digital [[collation]]." For example, when copying a set of 20 pages 20 times, a digital copier scans each page only once, then uses the stored information to produce 20 sets. In an analog copier, either each page is scanned 20 times (a total of 400 scans), making one set at a time, or 20 separate output trays are used for the 20 sets.

Low-end copiers also use [[Digital data|digital]] technology, but tend to consist of a standard PC scanner coupled to an inkjet or low-end laser printer, both of which are far slower than their counterparts in high-end copiers. However, low-end scanner-inkjets can provide color copying at a lower purchase price but with a much higher cost per copy. The cost of electronics is such that combined scanner-printers sometimes have built-in fax machines. (See [[Multifunction printer]].)

==How it works (using xerography)==
[[File:Xerographic photocopy process en.svg|thumb|right|220px|Schematic overview of the xerographic photocopying process (step 1-4)]]
{{Main|Xerography}}
{{History of printing}}

#'''Charging''': cylindrical drum is electrostatically charged by a high voltage wire called a corona wire or a charge roller. The drum has a coating of a [[photoconductive]] material.  A photoconductor is a [[semiconductor]] that becomes conductive when exposed to light.&lt;ref name="EncartaPhotoconductor"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/photoconductor.html|title=Encarta definition of 'photoconductor'|accessdate=2009-11-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211205730/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/photoconductor.html|archivedate=2008-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Exposure''':  A bright lamp illuminates the original document, and the white areas of the original document reflect the light onto the surface of the photoconductive drum.  The areas of the drum that are exposed to light become conductive and therefore discharge to the ground.  The area of the drum not exposed to light (those areas that correspond to black portions of the original document) remains negatively charged. 
#'''Developing''':  The [[toner]] is positively charged.  When it is applied to the drum to develop the image, it is attracted and sticks to the areas that are negatively charged (black areas), just as paper sticks to a balloon with a static charge.
#'''Transfer''':  The resulting toner image on the surface of the drum is transferred from the drum onto a piece of paper with a higher negative charge than the drum.
#'''Fusing''':  The toner is melted and bonded to the paper by heat and pressure rollers.

A negative photocopy inverts the colors of the document when creating a photocopy, resulting in letters that appear white on a black background instead of black on a white background. Negative photocopies of old or faded documents sometimes produce documents which have better focus and are easier to read and study.

==Copyright issues==
Photocopying material that is subject to [[copyright]] (such as books or scientific papers) is subject to restrictions in most countries. This is common practice, as the cost of purchasing a book for the sake of one article or a few pages can be excessive.  The principle of [[fair use]] (in the United States) or [[fair dealing]] (in other [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] countries) allows copying for certain specified purposes.

In certain countries, such as [[Canada]], some [[university|universities]] pay royalties from each photocopy made at university copy machines and copy centers to [[copyright collective]]s out of the revenues from the photocopying, and these collectives distribute resulting funds to various scholarly publishers. In the United States, photocopied compilations of articles, handouts, graphics, and other information called ''readers'' are often required texts for college classes. Either the instructor or the copy center is responsible for clearing copyright for every article in the reader, and attribution information must be clearly included in the reader.

==Counterfeiting==
To counter the risk of people using color copiers to create [[counterfeit]] copies of paper currency, some countries have incorporated anti-counterfeiting technologies into their currency.  These include watermarks, microprinting, [[holography|hologram]]s, tiny security strips made of plastic (or other material), and ink that appears to change color as the currency is viewed at an angle.  Some photocopying machines contain special [[software]] that can prevent copying currency that contains a [[EURion constellation|special pattern]].

Color copying also raises concerns regarding the copying and/or forging of other documents as well, such as driver's licenses and university degrees and transcripts. Some driver's licenses are made with embedded holograms so that a police officer can detect a fake copy. Some university and college transcripts  have special anti-copying [[watermark]]s in the background. If a copy is made, the watermarks will become highly visible, which allows the recipient to determine that they have a copy rather than a genuine original transcript.

==Health issues==
Exposure to [[ultraviolet light]] is a concern. In the early days of photocopiers, the sensitizing light source was filtered green to match the optimal sensitivity of the photoconductive surface. This filtering conveniently removed all ultraviolet.&lt;ref name="HazardsSurvey"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aic.stanford.edu/sg/bpg/annual/v08/bp08-05.html#note17|title=Photocopier Hazards and a Conservation Case Study (notes 17,18)|accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, a variety of light sources are used. As [[glass]] transmits ultraviolet rays between 325 and 400 nanometers, copiers with ultraviolet-producing lights such as fluorescent, [[tungsten]] halogen, or [[xenon]] flash, expose documents to some ultraviolet.&lt;ref name="HazardsSurvey"/&gt;

Concerns about emissions from photocopy machines have been expressed by some in connection with the use of [[selenium]] and emissions of [[ozone]] and fumes from heated toner.&lt;ref name="LondonHazardsCentre2002"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/factsht/76fact.pdf|title=Photocopier and Laser Printer Hazards|accessdate=2009-11-20|publisher=London Hazards Centre|year=2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401010211/http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/factsht/76fact.pdf|archivedate=2010-04-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasuwt"&gt;

==Forensic identification==
{{Main|Printer steganography}}
&lt;!-- Identical with computer printers. Changes here should be done there too. --&gt;
Similar to [[forensic identification]] of [[Typewriter#Forensic examination|typewriters]], [[computer printer]]s and copiers can be traced by imperfections in their output.  The mechanical tolerances of the toner and paper feed mechanisms cause [[Colour banding|banding]], which can reveal information about the individual device's mechanical properties. It is often possible to identify the manufacturer and brand, and, in some cases, the individual printer can be identified from a set of known printers by comparing their outputs.&lt;ref name="Purdue2004"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.uns.purdue.edu/UNS/html4ever/2004/041011.Delp.forensics.html|title=Printer forensics to aid homeland security, tracing counterfeiters|accessdate=2009-11-20|date=2004-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some high-quality color printers and copiers [[steganography|steganographically]] embed their identification code into the printed pages, as fine and almost invisible patterns of yellow dots. Some sources identify [[Xerox]] and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] as companies doing this.&lt;ref name="PcWorldTracking"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/118664/government_uses_color_laser_printer_technology_to_track_documents.html|title=Government Uses Color Laser Printer Technology to Track Documents|accessdate=2009-11-20|date=2004-11-22|author=Jason Tuohey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PcWorldDuchTracking"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/8305/dutch_track_counterfeits_via_printer_serial_numbers|title=Dutch track counterfeits via printer serial numbers|accessdate=2009-11-20|date=2004-10-26|author=Wilbert de Vries}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) has investigated this issue&lt;ref name="EffSpy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/printers|title=Is Your Printer Spying On You?|accessdate=2009-11-20|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and documented how the Xerox DocuColor printer's serial number, as well as the date and time of the printout, are encoded in a repeating 8×15 dot pattern in the yellow channel.

The EFF has filed a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request in order to look into privacy implications of this tracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/printers|title=Printers|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RMS ''Arabia''''' was a [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&amp;O]] [[ocean liner]]. She was sunk in the Mediterranean in 1916 by a German [[U-boat]] during [[World War I]].

==History==
[[Caird &amp; Company]] built  ''Arabia'' at [[Greenock]] on the [[River Clyde]], launching her in November 1897 and completing her in March 1898. She had capacity for 317 first class and 152 second class passengers, a total of 469.&lt;ref name=P&amp;OHeritage&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poheritage.com/Content/Mimsy/Media/factsheet/95400ARABIA-1898pdf.pdf |title=Arabia (1898 |work=Fact Sheet |publisher=P&amp;O Heritage |date=June 2009 |accessdate=30 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075001/http://www.poheritage.com/Content/Mimsy/Media/factsheet/95400ARABIA-1898pdf.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first ocean liner to have a children's playroom.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

''Arabia''{{'}}s route was between [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury]] and [[Mumbai Harbour|Bombay]]. On her maiden voyage she took [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Kedleston]] to take up his post as [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy of India]]. In 1902 she took passengers to India for the [[Delhi Durbar#Durbar of 1903|1903 Delhi Durbar]].&lt;ref name=P&amp;OHeritage/&gt;

On 15 March 1905  the {{GRT|4206}} cargo steamship {{SS|Riverdale|1900|2}} was manœuvreing in Bombay Harbour when she struck ''Arabia'' amidships on her port side, damaging the liner's promenade deck, boat deck and upper works. The collision was caused by ''Riverdale''{{'}}s [[chief engineer]] inexplicably setting her engine to go ahead when ordered to go astern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.plimsoll.org/images/75104_tcm4-313697.pdf |title="Riverdale" (S.S.) and "Arabia" (S.S.) |publisher=PortCities Southampton |date=28 March 1905 |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 October 1912 the steamship ''Powerful'' collided with ''Arabia'' in the [[English Channel]] off [[Southampton]]. ''Powerful''{{'}}s bow holed the crew WC above the waterline, crushing [[lascar]] crewman Hassan Moosa to death.&lt;ref name=P&amp;OHeritage/&gt;

In 1915 and 1916 ''Arabia'' made three voyages between Britain and [[Australia]]. On 6 November 1916 she was ''en route'' from [[Port Jackson|Sydney]] ''via'' [[Fremantle Harbour|Fremantle]], Western Australia to England when the German submarine {{SMU|UB-43||2}} torpedoed her without warning {{convert|180|km|nmi|disp=flip}} south by west of [[Cape Matapan]], Greece, killing 11 of her engine room crew. ''Arabia'' launched her boats within 15 minutes. Four [[Naval trawler|armed trawlers]] and [[Ellerman Lines]]' {{GRT|8204}} passenger liner {{SS|City of Marseilles||2}} rescued survivors.&lt;ref name=P&amp;OHeritage/&gt;

[[File:TOR New Orleans float.jpg|thumb|A float from the 2008 Rose Parade]]
The '''Rose Parade''', also known as the '''Tournament of Roses Parade''', is a parade held in [[Pasadena, California]] each year on [[New Year's Day]] (or on Monday, January 2 if New Year's Day falls on a Sunday). The parade includes flower-covered floats, marching bands, and equestrian units and is followed by the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] college football game. It is produced by the nonprofit [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association]].

Originally started on January 1, 1890, the Rose Parade is watched in person by hundreds of thousands of spectators on the parade route,&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/readers/2009/01/rose-parade-big.html Los Angeles Times, "Big crowd, but who's counting?"] Accessed 2009-01-15&lt;/ref&gt; and is broadcast on multiple [[television network]]s in the United States. It is seen by millions more on television worldwide in more than 100 international territories and countries.&lt;ref&gt;2009 Tournament Times, a publication of Tournament of Roses Association&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] is a [[college football]] game that was added in 1902 to help fund the cost of staging the parade.&lt;ref&gt;Mary L. Grady, [http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/east_king/mir/news/103769139.html Mercer Island High School Marching Band to march in 2012 Tournament of Roses Parade] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004015246/http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/east_king/mir/news/103769139.html |date=2010-10-04 }}, ''Mercer Island Reporter'', September 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, the parade has been sponsored by [[Honda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2011-12-25 |url=http://www.tournamentofroses.com |title=The Pasadena Tournament of Roses |publisher=Pasadena Tournament of Roses}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the company has the parade's first float, which like all floats, follows the parade's theme.

Rose Parade 2018 featured 44 floats, 20 equestrian units with approximately 400 horses, and 21 marching bands. The theme of this 129th Rose Parade was "Making a Difference" and the Grand Marshal of the parade was [[Gary Sinise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Order of March|url=http://roseparadeonline.com/|website=Rose Parade|accessdate=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Members of Pasadena's [[Valley Hunt Club]] first staged the parade in 1890. Since then the parade has been held in Pasadena every [[New Year's Day]], except when January 1 falls on a Sunday. In that case, it is held on the subsequent Monday, January 2. This exception was instituted in 1893, as organizers did not wish to disturb horses hitched outside Sunday church services.&lt;ref name="lat-neversunday"&gt;{{cite web|title=An old rule may save the Rose Parade from getting rained on|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-rose-parade-rain-20161227-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the members of the Valley Hunt Club were former residents of the American [[Eastern United States|East]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. They wished to showcase their new California home's mild winter weather. At a club meeting, Professor [[Charles Frederick Holder|Charles F. Holder]] announced, "In New York, people are buried in the snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let's hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise."

So the club organized horse-drawn carriages covered in flowers, followed by foot races, polo matches, and a game of tug-of-war on the town lot that attracted a crowd of 2,000 to the event. Upon seeing the scores of flowers on display, the professor decided to suggest the name "Tournament of Roses."
[[File:Pasadena Tournament of Roses chariot race, 1911 (CHS-309).jpg|thumb|right|A Chariot Race during the 1908 or 1911 Tournament of Roses; later replaced by the Rose Bowl Game]]
Over the next few founding years, marching bands and motorized floats were added. By 1895, the event was too large for the Valley Hunt Club to handle, hence the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses]] Association was formed. By the 11th annual tournament (1900), the town lot on which the activities were held was renamed [[Tournament Park]], a large open area directly adjacent to Pasadena's world-famous institution of higher learning, [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Activities soon included ostrich races, [[bronco]] busting demonstrations, and an odd novelty race between a camel and an elephant. (The elephant won the race.)  Soon reviewing stands were built along the parade route and newspapers in [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] cities started to take notice of the event.
[[File:Tournament House.jpg|thumb|Tournament House]]
The stately Italian Renaissance-style mansion of [[William Wrigley Jr.]] (the maker of [[Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company|Wrigley's chewing gum]]) was offered to the city of Pasadena after Mrs. Wrigley's death in 1958, under the condition that their home would be the Rose Parade's permanent headquarters. [[Tournament House]] is the name given the former home where the organization is headquartered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tournamentofroses.com/aboutus/house.asp|title=History of the Tournament House|work=Tournament of Roses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first associated football game was played on January 1, 1902. Originally titled the "Tournament East-West football game," it is considered to be the [[1902 Rose Bowl|first Rose Bowl]]. The next game was not played until New Year's Day 1916; they have been played annually since then. The game derives its modern name from [[Rose Bowl Stadium]], which was built for the 1923 game.

In 2002 and 2006 (when the Rose Bowl Game was the [[BCS National Championship Game]]), the "Granddaddy of 'em all" was not held the same day as the parade; the 2006 game was played on January 4. Not all fans were pleased with the change; some thought the atmosphere and tradition of the Rose Bowl were lost. Once the BCS title game was separated from the host bowl, it no longer affected the date of the Rose Bowl Game (even when the title game returned to Pasadena in 2010 and 2014).

==Parade==
[[File:roseparade1.jpg|thumb|right|A close-up of roses used to create a parade float]]
The Tournament of Roses Parade has followed the same route mainly following [[Colorado Boulevard]] (Pasadena's main thoroughfare and a segment of the former [[U.S. Route 66 (California)|US 66]]) for many decades. The day before the parade, the entire environs of the neighborhood streets south of the intersection of Orange Grove and Colorado Blvds. are sealed off and reserved for the marshaling of the dozens of floats, bands, equestrian units, and other elements. This staging area is referred to as the "Formation Area" and is managed by the Formation Area Committee.

On parade morning the various elements are merged and dispatched in front of [[Tournament House]]. The parade starts headed north on [[South Orange Grove Boulevard (Pasadena, California)|South Orange Grove Boulevard]] beginning at Green Street. At [[Colorado Boulevard (Pasadena, California)|Colorado Boulevard]] it passes the main grandstands (and the main television and media stands) and proceeds east on Colorado Boulevard. The parade then turns north on Sierra Madre Boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tournamentofroses.com/RoseParade/GeneralInformation/ParadeDayGuide.aspx
|title=Tournament of Roses: Rose Parade: General Information: Game Day Guide|accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floats then must travel under the Sierra Madre Boulevard/[[Interstate 210 (California)|I-210]] freeway overpass, requiring over-height floats to reduce their height. The parade ends at Paloma Street near Victory Park and [[Pasadena High School (California)|Pasadena High School]]. Floats continue into the Post-Parade viewing area (which is open that afternoon and the following day). In total this route is {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} long; the assembled bands, horse units and floats take approximately two hours to pass by.

===Recent parades===

The 2009 parade featured 46 floats, including some new entries, such as [[Jack in the Box]]'s ''Jack-O-Licious'', [[Mission Viejo, California|City of Mission Viejo]]'s ''Making a Splash'', [[RFD-TV]]'s ''Hee Haw'', and the [[Roseville, California|City of Roseville]]'s ''Entertaining Dreams for a Century''.

The [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]] float ("Living the Dream: Love Is the Best Protection") featured a wedding of a California couple, Aubrey Loots and Danny Leclair; some people called for a boycott of the parade as the couple were both men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-ln-gay-wedding-rose-parade-20131228,0,1994835.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Soumya | last=Karlamangla | title=Gay couple to marry on Rose Parade float | date=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nancy O'Dell]], along with [[Jonathan Scott (Canadian actor)|Jonathan]] and [[Drew Scott]] (of the ''[[Property Brothers]]'') co-hosted the parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title =Nancy O'Dell, Property Brothers to host HGTV's Rose Parade 2014 | publisher =Scripps Networks Interactive | date =September 26, 2013 | url =http://www.scrippsnetworksinteractive.com/newsroom/company-news/Pages/Nancy-O'Dell,-Property-Brothers-to-host-HGTV's-Rose-Parade-2014.aspx | access-date =March 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Floats==

{{Main article|Tournament of Roses floats}}

Originally the parade featured flower-decorated horse carriages. Over time, floats built by volunteers from sponsoring communities supplanted the carriages. Currently most are built by professional float building companies and take nearly a year to construct. Some communities and organizational sponsors still rely on volunteers. The [[Valley Hunt Club]] still enters a flower-decorated carriage. The [[Cal Poly Universities Rose Float]] still relies solely on students who volunteer. Floats are self-propelled on (generally used-up) truck chassis{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} in contrast to the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] which uses trailer-based floats pulled by new, intact ([[Product placement|sponsor-provided]]) trucks.

Typically 48 to 72 hours prior to parade day, one can view several of the floats being decorated with flowery mantles in the various 'float barns' that dot the [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]] / Rose Bowl area in West Pasadena, not far from the start of the parade. It is a rule of the parade that all surfaces of the float framework must be covered in natural materials (such as flowers, plants, seaweeds, seeds, bark, vegetables, or nuts, for example); furthermore, no artificial flowers or plant material are allowed, nor can the materials be artificially colored. Last-minute volunteer opportunities are usually available.

[[Anaheim, California|Anaheim city's float]] at the 2008 Rose Parade included the [[Stanley Cup]] that the [[NHL]]'s [[Anaheim Ducks]] had won last season, hoisted by player [[Brad May]]. (As the regulations state that the outside of the float must exclusively use [[organic material]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] commentators speculated that the city got an exception to display the Cup.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/float-ccix-character-1950338-anaheim-cup|title=Page not found - The Orange County Register|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] had a float in celebration of the franchise's 50th anniversary in [[Los Angeles]], with Hall of Fame sportscasters [[Vin Scully]] and [[Jaime Jarrin]] as well as former players [[Steve Garvey]], [[Fernando Valenzuela]], [[Eric Karros]], and [[Nomar Garciaparra]].

The 2010 parade floats included the [[Boy Scouts of America]]'s 100th Anniversary float, the [[List of diplomatic missions of Mexico|Consulate General of Mexico]] in Los Angeles in celebration of Mexico's bicentennial of independence, and "Safety Harbor Kids". The 2010 parade also featured a {{convert|113|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} float from [[Dick Van Patten]]'s [[Natural Balance Pet Foods]], which set a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness]] world record for the longest single-chassis float. The City of [[West Covina, California|West Covina]] paid tribute to the "service and commitment of the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]" with a float entitled ''"Tuskegee Airmen – A Cut Above"'', which featured a large bald eagle, two replica World War II [[Red Tail Project|"Redtails"]] fighter planes, and historical images of some of the airmen who served our country. The float won the Mayor's trophy as the most outstanding city entry – national or international, also [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] float featured the [[2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] that was played at [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim]], four former MLB All-Stars, pitchers [[Mark Langston]], [[Chuck Finley]], and [[Troy Percival]], along with second baseman [[Bobby Grich]] were aboard.

Since January 1, 2012, fell on a Sunday, tradition dictated that the parade would be held on Monday, January 2, 2012. The 2012 Rose Parade had 43 floats, featuring the [[Loyola Marymount University|LMU]] Centennial Celebration float,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Wakelee-lynch, [http://magazine.lmu.edu/archive/2011/lmu-rose-parade-bound LMU: Rose Parade Bound] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313104836/http://magazine.lmu.edu/archive/2011/lmu-rose-parade-bound |date=2011-03-13 }}, LMU Magazine, March 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] 100th Anniversary float (entitled ''"What Will You Do Today?"''). Float builder Fiesta Floats donated their services to the design of the Girl Scouts float, which was decorated by the organization's volunteers (of all ages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.girlscoutsla.org/pages/events/TOR_parade.html|title=GSGLA : Tournament of Roses Parade|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110193210/http://www.girlscoutsla.org/pages/events/TOR_parade.html|archivedate=2011-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paramount Pictures]] also participated in the 2012 parade with its centennial celebration float "''100 Years of Movie Magic"''. [[Namco Bandai Games]] joined the parade for the first time, commemorating the [[Power Rangers]]. Others were [[Microsoft]] [[Kinect]] ("''You are the Controller"'') and the [[Kit-Cat Klock]] (''"Timeless Fun for Everyone"'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kit-cat.com/kit-cat-com/invite-to-kit-cat%c2%aes-80th-bday-in-the-rose-parade%c2%ae/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416152700/http://www.kit-cat.com/kit-cat-com/invite-to-kit-cat%c2%aes-80th-bday-in-the-rose-parade%c2%ae/ |archivedate=2012-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The floats compete for one of 24 awards selected by three judges each year. The 2013 parade float judges were esteemed floral designer Shane Connolly, [[Macy's]] marketing executive and event producer Amy Kule, and Brian Sullivan, an executive with Southern California's [[Descanso Gardens]]. Since Honda became the title sponsor, its floats are not eligible to compete for an award.

After the parade the floats are parked at the end of the parade route on Sierra Madre Boulevard and Washington Boulevard, near [[Victory Park, Pasadena, California|Victory Park]] and are on display for a day and a half (two-and-a-half days when January 1 falls on Friday) after the parade. None of the float riders or dignitaries/celebrities involved in the parade are present, and animated features on some floats are not activated. Admission to the viewing area is $13 and children are admitted free.

From the beginning horses have played a part in the Rose Parade. Thousands of riders have made the trek down Colorado Boulevard. "The Tournament equestrian family grows bigger and stronger every year as it welcomes the new equestrians who come to share the magic of New Year's Day and appreciate the commitment to excellence and professionalism exhibited by the returning equestrian units to the parade," according to the Tournament of Roses.

Prior to the parade an "Equestfest" is held at the [[Equidome|Los Angeles Equestrian Center]] to showcase the performances by the talented riding teams.

==Bands==
{{Main article|Rose Parade marching bands}}
[[File:Bandtournamentrosesparade.jpg|thumb|left|[[Londonderry High School]] Marching Lancer Band, from New Hampshire during the 2004 parade]]
Top marching bands from all over the world are invited. Many of the nation's top high school marching bands, along with college and organizational marching bands participate.

The bands participating in the parade have developed traditions throughout the its history. For example, [[Pasadena City College]]'s Tournament of Roses Honor Band always marches in the Rose Parade, along with the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] All City Honor Band, all of whom are selected by audition the previous autumn. Positions in both bands are coveted, and those selected are among the best student musicians in California.

The Tournament of Roses Honor Band's Herald Trumpets unit marches and plays directly before the Rose Queen's float. Nine trumpet players and one snare drummer are selected from those who audition for the band for the unit.

University marching bands from the two schools competing in the Rose Bowl Game are invited to march in the parade. They typically accompany the float that represents the school and conference.

Bands that have a long-standing arrangement to be in the parade include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tournamentofroses.com/roseparade/participants.asp Rose Parade Participants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014175306/http://www.tournamentofroses.com/roseparade/participants.asp |date=2008-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the [[Washington Township High School (New Jersey)|Washington Township High School]] Minutemen Marching Band from [[Sewell, New Jersey]] became the first band in the history of the Rose Parade to decorate its entire ranks with live flowers, in keeping with the practice of decorating the parade floats.  From the neighboring town of Arcadia, the Arcadia High School Apache Marching Band and Colorgaurd has appeared for 15 years, returning about every four years.  The Allen Eagle Escadrille from Allen, Texas had a record breaking 780 members in the 2016 Rose Parade.

In addition to the parade, the bands participate in a two-day, three-show Bandfest at [[Pasadena City College]]'s [[Jackie Robinson|Jackie]] and [[Mack Robinson (athlete)|Mack]] Robinson Stadium, usually on December 29 and 30 (December 30 and 31 when the parade is on January 2).

==Rose Parade Theme==
[[File:Tournament of Roses Parade 2010 Float.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Theme float "2010: A Cut Above the Rest" rolling down Colorado Boulevard during the parade]]
{{Main article|Tournament of Roses Parade themes}}

Shortly after the parade in January, the newly elected President of the Tournament of Roses has the duty of picking a theme for the forthcoming festivities. Most of the floral floats in the parade are inspired by this theme.

On January 18, 2018, Gerald Freeny was confirmed as President of the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses|Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association]]. He announced that the theme for the 130th Rose Parade and 105th Rose Bowl Game is ''The Melody of Life''. The parade and bowl game will be held on January 1, 2019. The Tournament of Roses President will lead the 14-member Executive Committee and the organization of 935 volunteer members for the upcoming year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henry|first1=Jason|title=Tournament of Roses president unveils 2018 Rose Parade theme|url=http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/lifestyle/20170119/tournament-of-roses-president-unveils-2018-rose-parade-theme|accessdate=20 January 2017|publisher=[[Pasadena Star News]]|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
{{Main article|List of Presidents of the Tournament of Roses Association|l1=Presidents of the Tournament of Roses Association}}
Each year, the newly elected Tournament of Roses President is responsible for selecting the year's theme and grand marshal. Preparation and construction of the floral floats theoretically begins after the theme is announced. The selection of marching bands is already well under way except for Rose Bowl Game college bands. In 2005, Libby Evans Wright was elected as the first female president of the Association.

The Pasadena Tournament of Roses appointed former ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' executive P. Scott McKibben as its executive director in 2010, replacing John M. (Mitch) Dorger, who had served as CEO since 2000. On September 8, 2011, he resigned for personal reasons. Chief Operating Officer William B. Flinn was named interim executive director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_18852302 McKibben resigns from Tournament of Roses top job] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108034309/http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_18852302 |date=2012-01-08 }}, ''Pasadena Star-News'', September 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; From March 1, 2012 to January 2, 2017, William B. Flinn took over the role of Executive Director. David Eads became the Executive Director in 2017.

===Operations and the parade===
[[File:TOR volunteers prepping flowers.jpg|thumb|left|Volunteers]]
The Tournament of Roses has become such a large event that it requires 65,000 hours of combined [[Human resources|manpower]] each year, or the equivalent of roughly 7.42 years of combined manpower. Fortunately for the Association, the group has 935 members, each of whom is assigned to one of 34 committees, and around 50 student ambassadors. Responsibilities include:
* Selecting Parade participants
* Inspecting and testing floats for safe and reliable operation
* Assembling the parade elements
* Conducting the parade through the streets of Pasadena
* Directing visitors on New Year's Day
* Assisting the public and the media in viewing the parade
* Giving presentations about the Tournament to community groups
* Supervising elements of the Rose Bowl Game (and also the BCS National Championship Game when held in Pasadena)

During the Parade, many Tournament members are required to wear white suits with red ties, name tags, membership pins and official ribbons. Because of this, the volunteers are commonly referred to as "White Suiters."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tournamentofroses.com/PasadenaTournamentofRoses/AboutUs/PasadenaTournamentOfRoses.aspx About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122114224/http://www.tournamentofroses.com/PasadenaTournamentofRoses/AboutUs/PasadenaTournamentOfRoses.aspx |date=2012-11-22 }}, Pasadena Tournament of Roses, Retrieved November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In December each year, a fleet of white vehicles with special "ToR" [[license plates]] are seen throughout the [[San Gabriel Valley]]. The use of these cars is currently donated by American Honda for use by high-ranking Tournament members.

Each year, an honor troop of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scouts]] from the [[San Gabriel Valley Council]], (now [[Greater Los Angeles Area Council|GLAAC]]), and "The Tournament Troop" of Girl Scout [[Gold Award (Girl Scouts of the USA)|Gold Award recipients]] of the [[Arcadia]] Service Unit of the Girl Scouts Greater Los Angeles, is selected to carry the parade banners down the route. Each year, for the last 35 years, more than 100 scouts have participated.

The ''Tournament of Roses Radio Amateurs'' (TORRA) provided audio communications and video co-ordination for the parade officials through the use of [[Amateur radio]] from 1968 until 2005. With over 300 [[Amateur radio operator|ham radio operators]] in TORRA there were several [[Amateur radio station|ham radio sites]] along the parade route equipped with [[amateur television]] as well as 2-way ham radios. Several mobile units – including motorcycles and pedestrian units (creepie-peepies) provided the video coverage. With modern technology and cell phone service, TORRA was no longer needed.

Thousands more volunteers help cover the floats in those beautiful flower and seed mixes during "Deco week," Dec 26- parade day. Many of these come back year after year, some even camp nearby to help all week long.

[[File:PreRoseParade-010104.jpg|thumb|right|Spectators gather before the 2004 Rose Parade: some pay for seats in stands; others spend the night to "reserve" a free spot on the sidewalks.]]

For the 2006 Tournament of Roses Parade on January 2 (it is always held on January 2 when January 1 falls on a Sunday) winds with gusts up to {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and five [[inch]]es (130 [[millimeter|mm]]) of rain in the Pasadena area were predicted. The forecast proved accurate, ruining the 51 year record of good weather for the parade. It rained continuously and heavily throughout the entire 2006 parade. The President of the Tournament, the Grand Marshal of the Parade and the executive committee{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}, deliberated into the early morning at the Tournament House. With street rumors circulating of the parade being canceled or postponed and restlessness of the crowd further east along the parade route, the parade got underway despite the bleak weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=117th Rose Parade|url=http://www.upi.com/enl-win/00cb734c6d2b6349c8af55d4caa43df8/|publisher=UPI|accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low television ratings and poor attendance plagued the ceremony. Some floats sustained water damage by the end of the parade.

The '''Royal Lyceum Theatre''' is a 658-seat [[theatre]] in the city of [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], named after the [[Theatre Royal Lyceum and English Opera House]], the residence at the time of legendary [[Shakespearean]] actor [[Henry Irving]]. It was built in 1883 by [[architect]] [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]] at a cost of £17,000 on behalf of James B. Howard and Fred. W. P. Wyndham,&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{Citation | last = Hartnoll | first = Phyllis | last2 = Found | first2 = Peter | title = The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1996 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O79-RoyalLyceumTheatre.html | isbn = 978-0-19-211576-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; two theatrical managers and performers whose partnership became the renowned [[Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd]] created in 1895 by Michael Simons of Glasgow.&lt;ref name="100yrs"&gt;{{Citation | last = Campbell | first = Donald | title = A brighter sunshine: A hundred years of the Edinburgh Royal Lyceum Theatre | publisher = Polygon | year = 1983 | url = | isbn = 978-0-904919-70-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Edinburgh/Lyceum.htm | title=The Royal Lyceum Theatre, Grindley Street and Cornwall Street, Edinburgh, Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/TRHope.htm | title=The Theatre Royal, 282 Hope Street, Cowcaddens, Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With only four minor refurbishments, in 1929, 1977, 1991, and 1996, the Royal Lyceum remains one of the most original and unaltered of the architect's works.&lt;ref name="building"&gt;[http://www.lyceum.org.uk/webpages/inside_history.php "Building history"], Royal Lyceum website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the building was purchased by the Edinburgh Corporation to house the newly formed '''Royal Lyceum Theatre Company''', who are now the permanent residents, leasing it from the [[City of Edinburgh Council|local council]].&lt;ref name="company"&gt;[http://www.lyceum.org.uk/webpages/inside_history.php "Company history"], Royal Lyceum website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Lyceum has been one of the principal venues for the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] since the festival's inception in 1947, its owners renting out the building for three weeks every August for visiting companies, and often for a further week to [[Edinburgh Fringe|Fringe]] companies.&lt;ref name="company"/&gt;

The Royal Lyceum has primarily been known for its provision of drama. However it has also presented some significant opera, from the first tours of [[Carl Rosa Opera Company|Carl Rosa]] in the latter part of the 19th century through to the early decades of [[Scottish Opera]] in the 1960s and 1970s. Some important operas received their first Scottish performance at the Lyceum, including ''[[Madam Butterfly]]'', ''[[Manon]]'' and ''[[Die Meistersinger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operascotland.org/venue/77/Royal+Lyceum+Theatre+%7C+Edinburgh Fraser, Iain and Fraser, Stephen (2013) 'Royal Lyceum Theatre' OperaScotland]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was the first in Britain to be fitted with an iron safety curtain, and the first in Scotland to use electricity for house lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scotlandʼs splendid theatres : architecture and social history from the Reformation to the present day|last=Bruce.|first=Peter|date=1999|publisher=Polygon|isbn=978-0748662616|location=Edinburgh|pages=32–33|oclc=44184624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre is believed to be haunted and there have been sightings of a blue lady who is believed to be [[Ellen Terry]], the actress who performed at the Lyceum’s first show. In addition a shadowy figure has been reportedly seen high above the stage in the lighting rig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why you've more than a ghost of a chance of seeing a spook| url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/why-you-ve-more-than-a-ghost-of-a-chance-of-seeing-a-spook-1-1045900 | location=Edinburgh | work=The Scotsman | date=8 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sightings have been reported to have been accompanied by a ringing noise.

'''SS ''Walnut''''' was a refugee ship converted from a British [[minesweeping]] [[Tree-class trawler]] which carried Baltic refugees from Sweden to Canada in 1948. The refugees' arrival at [[Pier 21]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] led to a controversy which played an important role in shaping Canada's postwar refugee policies.&lt;ref name=raska&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pier21.ca/blog/jan-raska/baltic-refugees-canadian-immigration-policy-and-the-arrival-of-ss-walnut |first=Jan |last=Raska |title=Baltic Refugees, Canadian Immigration Policy and the Arrival of SS Walnut |publisher=Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially entering service during the [[Second World War]] as '''HMT ''Walnut''''', the trawler was sold for commercial purposes following the war. Converted for use as a cargo ship, the vessel retained the name ''Walnut''  until 1959 when sold and renamed '''''Keta'''''. The ship was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1976.

==Design and description==
Tree-class trawlers were designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] 545 tons standard and 770 tons at deep load. They were {{convert|164|ft|m}} [[Length overall|long overall]] with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|27|ft|8|in|m}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|11|ft|1|in|m}}. They were powered by a one-cylinder boiler providing steam to one [[triple expansion engine|vertical triple expansion engine]]. This drove one shaft creating {{convert|850|ihp|kW|lk=in}} and giving the ship a maximum speed of {{convert|12.25|kn|lk=in}}. The ship could carry 183 tons of coal.&lt;ref name=conway&gt;Chesneau, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tree class was armed with one [[QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun|QF 12-pounder (76 mm)]] gun, three [[20 mm Oerlikon]] anti-aircraft guns and 30 [[depth charge]]s. The trawlers had a complement of 40.&lt;ref name=conway/&gt;

==Royal Navy service==
''Walnut'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 15 June 1939 as HMT ''Walnut'' (T103) by [[Smiths Dock Company]] at [[South Bank, Middlesbrough]] with the yard number 1031, one of 20 {{sclass2-|Tree|trawler|1}}s built for the British [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name=conway/&gt;&lt;ref name=miramar&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=5185958|shipname=Walnut |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Walnut'' was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 12 August 1939 and completed on 13 December 1939.&lt;ref name=miramar/&gt; ''Walnut'' belonged to a group of ten minesweepers commanded by New Zealanders in the 24th and 25th anti-submarine and minesweeping flotillas, protecting convoys on the east coast of Britain where they faced numerous German air and sea attacks. ''Walnut''{{'}}s commander, [[Gordon Bridson]], received the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his performance while in command of ''Walnut''.&lt;ref name=Dennerly2000&gt;{{cite web |last=Dennerly |first=P.

==Refugee ship==
''Walnut'' was first purchased by the Swedish firm Stem Olson and converted to a coastal cargo ship. In September 1948 the ship was purchased by a group of refugees from several Baltic countries who pooled their life savings to form a company called "Compania Maritima Walnut S/A".&lt;ref name=freedom&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walnutship1948.ca/Walnut_ship_Estonian_Refugees_statistics.htm |title=Ship Statistics |website=SS Walnut 1948 - Voyaged to Freedom |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refugees had fled to Sweden after the Soviet occupation of the Baltic republics. The uncertainty of their status in Sweden and fears that they would be forcibly repatriated to the [[Soviet]]s led the refugees to search for ships which could take them to another country that might offer secure refuge. ''Walnut'' was registered under the Panama flag to avoid Swedish restrictions on passenger capacity and hastily converted to accommodate 200 passengers.

The ship sailed from [[Gothenburg]], Sweden on 13 November 1948 and stopped at [[Lysekil]], Sweden to complete the embarkation of passengers and supplies before a final departure on November 17.&lt;ref name=freedom/&gt; ''Walnut'' carried 347 passengers, mostly [[Estonia]]ns, but also Latvians, Lithuanians, Finns, Austrians, and Polish refugees.&lt;ref name=raska/&gt; ''Walnut'' stopped at [[Sligo]], Ireland to load coal before crossing the Atlantic. Designed for a civilian crew of 18 or a military crew of 40, the 347 passengers endured a difficult voyage in bad weather, battling leaks and seasickness but arrived safely at [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]] on 10 December where food and more coal  were taken aboard before the ship resumed its voyage for the Canadian immigration terminal at [[Pier 21]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=347 Refugees Fleeing Reds Believed on Way to Halifax |work=Halifax Mail |date=11 December 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian reaction==
''Walnut'' arrived at Halifax on 13 December. The small ship was among the smallest to ever call at the [[Pier 21]] immigration terminal, dwarfed by the giant [[Four funnel liner|four stacker]] [[RMS Aquitania]] which arrived at the same pier a few days later with 1,656 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;"Aquitania Lands 1,656 Passengers", ''The Halifax Mail'', Dec. 28, 1948, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Walnut'' presented Halifax immigration officials with a dilemma. The passengers aboard had arrived in Canada without permission or clearance, one of a series of small ships carrying Baltic refugees, nicknamed "The Viking Ships", which suddenly arrived in Canada in the fall of 1948. Others included the ships ''Gladstone'', ''Sarabande'', ''Parnu'', ''Ostervag'', ''Capry'', and ''Amanda''. ''Walnut'' had the largest number of aboard and became the focus of public and official attention over the fate of the refugees. The Baltic refugees had tried to come to Canada through official channels but were frustrated by the long delay and barriers in Canada's immigration system which left them vulnerable to a forced return to the Soviet controlled Baltic republics. ''Walnut''{{'}}s passengers were detained, some at Halifax's Rockhead prison and others in the detention quarters at the Pier 21 immigration terminal.

However the plight of the refugees soon attracted considerable support, especially as they arrived close to Christmas. The [[West End, Halifax|Halifax West End]] Baptist Church presented the refugees in detention with a radio for entertainment and organized a Christmas carol concert on December 21.&lt;ref&gt;"Gift radio Presented at Immigration", ''The Halifax Mail'', Dec. 22, 1948, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of civic groups led by the mayor of Halifax [[John E. Ahern]] banded together to present a Christmas concert and gifts to the refugees on Christmas Eve. Local seamstresses assembled a costume to represent an Estonian version of Santa Claus, Youluvana, for the captain of ''Walnut'' to wear as he gave presents to all the children aboard including silver dollars given the youngest child; the oldest refugee and the mother of the largest family meant to mark the "start of the wealth they would accumulate when they were allowed to settle in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;"Christmas Made Happy for Baltic Refugee Children", ''The Halifax Mail'', Dec. 27, 1948, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Public pressure and widespread press attention made Canadian immigration officials investigate and consider each passenger’s background. In the end, Canada admitted all but two passengers from ''Walnut'', waiving the immigration restrictions of the time by issuing an [[Order in Council]] for each individual. In January 1949, the ''Walnut'' refugees held a farewell party with local immigration officials before leaving by train to settle in various regions of Canada. The arrival of the small ex-warship had pushed Canadian immigration officials to change Canadian immigration intervention and interception policies.&lt;ref name=raska/&gt;

==Later career==
After ''Walnut''{{'}}s arrival in Halifax, the ship was detained at the French Cable Wharf in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia]]. The ship was sold by auction to pay for expenses from the voyage. During the protracted legal process surrounding her refugee passengers, the ship was stripped of its brass fittings by thieves and scuttled in shallow water in Dartmouth. The ship was sold at another auction in 1951 and rebuilt by the Quebec firm Borromee Verreault. ''Walnut'' was renamed ''Keta'' and worked on the [[St. Lawrence River]] and Canadian Arctic until the ship was scrapped in 1975.&lt;ref name=freedom/&gt;

==Commemoration==
Passengers who arrived aboard Walnut and their families remained in contact and organized several re-unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walnutship1948.ca/Walnut_Ship_Estonian_Refugees_Passenger_Anniversaries.htm |title=Reunions |website=SS Walnut 1948 - Voyaged to Freedom |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many shared photographs to remember their journey which were featured in a display at the Pier 21 museum which opened in the former immigration terminal in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lynda |last=Mannik |title=Photography, Memory and Refugee Identity: The Voyage of the SS Walnut, 1948 |publisher=UBC Press |date=2013 |pages=83–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Pier 21 museum reopened as national museum, the [[Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21]] in 2014, ''Walnut'' was featured in an interactive video which presents visitors with the 1948 ''Walnut'' controversy and asks them how they would have responded.

The '''Saipan incident''' was a public quarrel in May 2002 between [[Republic of Ireland national football team]]'s [[captain (association football)|captain]] [[Roy Keane]] and [[manager (football)|manager]] [[Mick McCarthy]] when the team was preparing in [[Saipan]] for its matches in [[Japan]] in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. It resulted in Keane, a key player, being sent home from the squad. The incident divided public opinion in Ireland regarding who was to blame.

==Background==
[[File:Roy Keane cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Roy Keane signing autographs in 2005.]]
Prior to the incident, Keane was captain of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Irish national team]]; since his senior debut under [[Jack Charlton]] and then-captain McCarthy, Keane had perceived problems with the preparations of the Irish side. He regarded the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI)'s preparations as unprofessional and challenged both Charlton and McCarthy in a number of notable incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Keane, Roy; Dunphy, Eamon (2002). Keane: The Autobiography. Michael Joseph. {{ISBN|0-7181-4554-2}}. p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Keane's issues with Irish management were the conditions of the camp, travel arrangements (which made the players sit in second class seats on flights, while FAI officials sat in first class), strategy, expectations, diet, and McCarthy's competence. In his autobiography, Keane said that before a [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifier away versus the Netherlands, the Irish players were eating cheesy sandwiches because the more suitable pre-match meal of pasta was not available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soccer-ireland.com/saipan/roy-keane/sandwiches.htm ''Soccer-Ireland.com''] Saipan Incident Thesis&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Cup preparation==
The island of [[Saipan]] was selected by an FAI delegation as an initial base. From management's perspective the time was considered a period of relative rest and recreation at the end of a long season before moving to Japan to up the preparation levels for the tournament. Keane, on the other hand, who is reputed to have told [[Alex Ferguson]] that he was going to the World Cup "to win it", viewed it as a period of preparation for the World Cup Finals. He therefore became dissatisfied when facilities and general preparation did not match his expectations.

On 21 May Keane decided he was going home but subsequently changed his mind and stayed on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/2002/0522/Pg022.html#Ar02201:0AA09020D1430C51500F016808935D0A43750A435D0B43751A929E1B42B51B42A01D42B517A37E1A639527A1EE2A62062AC2CF2D82E622240225F42142F4C044A4D844D4C045C4D86E44C370F4DB0A31500B71680B71500BF16819522E1B02451852FD1A131423832D2533442B928E2D42A61F640221B42140D4C04184D84184C242A4D7 ''Irish Times''] Archived Irish Times report on the incident.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The media==
Irish broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] became aware of the developing row, as did several Irish newspapers. Because of its isolated location, there were certain stories circulating about the event which were all critical of Keane. The ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' newspaper had been a harsh critic of Keane for months in the run up to the competition. This included persistent allegations about Keane's commitment to the Irish team.

Contrary to what many believe, that is, that Keane gave an interview to leading sports journalist [[Tom Humphries]] of the Irish broadsheet daily newspaper ''[[The Irish Times]]'', Keane had actually originally agreed to give the interview to [[Paul Kimmage]] of ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|The Sunday Independent]]''. Kimmage then agreed to let Tom Humphries join in on the interview, but made him promise not to print the article until after Kimmages column on Sunday. Humphries reneged on the deal and in retrospect this proved to be a major scoop for the ''Irish Times''. In the article, Keane listed the events and concerns which had led him to decide to leave the team. This article included details and references to the preparations that had been set in place for the Irish team. This would be an indirect implication that the event was organized as a junket for FAI officialdom. The article was seen as a direct affront to the authority of the Irish manager, and the competence of the FAI.

==The incident==
The ''Irish Times'' article increased tensions greatly. McCarthy decided to question Keane about the article. In a team meeting McCarthy held up a copy of the article and asked ''"What's this all about?"'', and an argument started. McCarthy then accused Keane of faking injury when Ireland were playing Iran in the second leg of the play off. Keane then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: ''"Mick, you're a liar … you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,9753,1606114,00.html |title=10 classic Roy Keane rants |work=Guardian football | location=London | date=24 August 2006 | accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mick McCarthy then held a press conference announcing that he had sent Keane home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2002/0523/26016-worldcup/|title=McCarthy sends Keane home from World Cup|date=23 May 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Niall Quinn]] observed in his autobiography that ''"Roy Keane's 10-minute oration [against Mick McCarthy] … was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society."'' But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that ''"[He] left us in Saipan, not the other way round. And he punished himself more than any of us by not coming back."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/5281188.stm |title=The Odd Couple |work=BBC Sport | date=27 August 2006 | accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of his team-mates voiced support for Keane during the meeting, though some later expressed their support to him privately. Keane mentioned in his autobiography that [[Gary Breen]] and [[David Connolly]] visited his room. Senior players [[Steve Staunton]] and [[Niall Quinn]] seemed to take the side of McCarthy, and the FAI, in the argument that followed. Staunton was the most loyal to the FAI line of the argument. He was later given the captaincy in Keane's absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/01/world-cup-moments-roy-keane-ireland-exit|title= World Cup: 25 stunning moments ... No13: Roy Keane walks out on Ireland|date=1 May 2014|work=Guardian|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Despite the efforts of the media and [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]], Keane and McCarthy failed to resolve the conflict and Keane missed the World Cup. Keane gave an interview concerning the controversy to RTÉ and when asked if it was possible to go back he did not deny that he might.  The Irish football team were defeated in a penalty shootout by [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the second round.

==The Genesis Report==
The FAI commissioned a report from external consultants Genesis, into its World Cup preparations. The "Genesis Report" agreed with many of Keane's criticisms, finding that the FAI structure was not conducive to good planning and making a range of recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;http://foot.ie/inc/pdf/genesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The complete report was never published for legal reasons.{{Explain|date=September 2018}} Brendan Menton resigned as FAI General Secretary at this time, and the media linked the two events, though Menton denied this.

==McCarthy's departure==
Roy Keane stated that he would not play again for Ireland under McCarthy, and in his autobiography even said that his former national team coach could 'rot in hell'. McCarthy continued as national team manager and Ireland then played [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in a [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying|qualifying match]] for the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]]. Ireland lost to a badly resourced Russian team 4–2, who had played badly in the World Cup. This was followed by a "booing" episode in Ireland's next qualifier against [[Switzerland]], with many fans blaming McCarthy. Ireland lost the game 2–1 at Lansdowne Road. In the face of rebellion on the terraces, a decrease in support for the national team, and consequent declining attendance revenues, the FAI decided to remove McCarthy. Ireland then failed to qualify for any major tournament until 2011, when after beating Estonia they qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 European Championships]]. The appointment of [[Brian Kerr (Irish football manager)|Brian Kerr]] as team manager in 2003 led to Keane's return to international football on 27 May 2004, in a friendly match against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] at [[Lansdowne Road]]. He played his final international game the following year, having been capped 67 times for the nation since 1991. He retired from playing at club level in 2006.

==Settling differences==
As of November 2006, Keane appeared to have mended the fences with McCarthy when the two men settled their differences via a phone call ahead of a match between McCarthy's [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and Keane's [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. The handshake between the two men received considerable media attention. In April 2007, the managers again met in another match, and Keane praised McCarthy for his work in Sunderland previous to Keane's tenure there.

In December 2013, Keane, speaking in an [[ITV4]] documentary, admitted his regret at missing out on the 2002 World Cup and said that he should have put his personal issues with McCarthy to one side for the sake of the country, saying "To play in the World Cup. It would have been nice to play, A lot of people were disappointed, particularly my family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/keane-missing-2002-world-cup-is-biggest-regret-of-my-career-29827520.html|title= Keane: Missing 2002 World Cup is biggest regret of my career|date=11 December 2013|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescore.ie/13-things-learned-keane-vieira-documentary-1216596-Dec2013/ |title=13 things we learned from the Roy Keane-Patrick Vieira documentary |date=11 December 2013 |work=The Score |accessdate=11 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213023801/http://www.thescore.ie/13-things-learned-keane-vieira-documentary-1216596-Dec2013/ |archivedate=13 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
The incident was so divisive that it was called a "civil war" for Ireland. The ''Irish Times'' later wrote that "[m]ost people have ... a story of a split between families, between friends, between work colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2012/0512/1224315983865.html?via=mr | title=How war in the Pacific brought madness to these shores | work=Irish Times | date=12 May 2012 | accessdate=12 May 2012 | author=Clerkin, Malachy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a musical comedy play parodying the incident and its key players, ''[[I, Keano]]'', opened in Dublin. The play, written by [[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]], [[Michael Nugent]], and [[Paul Woodfull]], represented the incident as a mock-epic melodrama about a Roman legion preparing for war. Keane attended a performance of the show,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2005/07/26/story963485323.asp Hundreds Queue for Tickets on Roy's Home Turf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929152925/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2005/07/26/story963485323.asp |date=29 September 2007 }} Niamh Hennessy, ''Irish Examiner'', 26 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; which ran in Dublin until May 2008.

In an echo of the incident, three main cast members, including [[Mario Rosenstock]], who portrayed "Keano" (the play's version of Roy Keane), left the show early in its first run, leading to media articles about [[life imitating art]] [[Mimesis|imitating life]].&lt;ref&gt;Art Imitates Life as Hit ''I, Keano'' Camp Splits.

'''San Francisco Jewish Film Festival''' is the oldest Jewish film festival in the world, and currently the largest with a 2016 attendance figure of 40,000 at screenings in San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland, San Rafael, and Palo Alto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AJFF Slips to No. 2|url=http://atlantajewishtimes.com/2016/08/ajff-slips-no-2/|website=Atlanta Jewish Times|publisher=Jewish Times|accessdate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-week summer festival is held in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], usually at the [[Castro Theater]] in San Francisco and other cinemas in San Francisco, [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], and [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], and features contemporary and classic independent Jewish film from around the world. In 2015, the organization re-branded itself as the Jewish Film Institute, retaining the name "San Francisco Jewish Film Festival" for the annual film festival.

The San Francisco Jewish Film Festival also maintains an online archive of Jewish film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfjff.org/film/search |title=Search |publisher=San Francisco Jewish Film Festival |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627031607/http://www.sfjff.org/film/search |archivedate=2013-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and holds individual film screenings throughout the year.

The festival was first held at the [[Roxie Theater]] in San Francisco in 1980. The current executive director is Lexi Leban and the program director is Jay Rosenblatt.

In 2009, the officials in charge of the event were criticized for the decision to the screen of a film about [[International Solidarity Movement|ISM]] activist [[Rachel Corrie]]. Writing in the [[J. (newspaper)|N. California JWeekly,]] Dan Pine noted "If the Academy handed out an Oscar for community turmoil, the Rachel Corrie flap at this year’s San Francisco Jewish Film Festival would win handily." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/39342/rachel-inferno-gets-even-hotter-for-s.f.-festival/|title=‘Rachel’ inferno gets even hotter for S.F. festival  {{!}}  j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California|last=pine|first=dan|website=www.jweekly.com|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pine reported that some Jewish community members said that festival organizers "crossed a line into overtly anti-Israel propaganda" and that "Corrie, and now her parents, have worked to ostracize and delegitimize Israel." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a statement, festival Executive Director Peter Stein apologized "for not fully considering how upsetting this program might be." At the same time, the festival did not back down from its decision to screen the film.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [http://sfjff36.jfi.org/festival-guide/ 36th festival] was held between July 21 and August 7, 2016, in five locations around the Bay Area. The featured films included "Germans &amp; Jews", and Director Janina Quint was scheduled to attended the screening.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The 37th festival took place July 20 to August 6, 2017, in the same five Bay Area locations as previous years.&lt;ref name="Article in J. Weekly"&gt;[https://www.jweekly.com/2017/06/07/sf-jewish-film-fest-highlights-women-directors-on-opening-closing-nights/ Article in ''J. Weekly'']&lt;/ref&gt; The opening and closing films, ''Keep the Change'' and ''[[Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story]]'',  were both directed by women.&lt;ref name="Article in J. Weekly"/&gt;

The 38th festival took place July 19 to August 5, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jfi.org/sf-jewish-film-festival SF Jewish Film Festival website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2157">'''"Sniper"''' is a [[ballad]] written by [[Harry Chapin]] and first released on the album ''[[Sniper and Other Love Songs]]'' in 1972.

==Overview==
The song, nearly 10 minutes long, is based on the shootings at the [[University of Texas tower shooting]] in 1966, with some fictional elements.  The song does not name the actual [[sniper]], [[Charles Whitman]], or the location. The victims' names have also been changed.

Harry wrote this piece using three distinct "voices" for dramatic effect.  Chapin sings all three voices.  The first is the narrator, telling the story.  The second is a variety of people reacting to the event, as if in response to news media questions.  And the third voice is that of the Sniper himself, stating his fears, his motives, and his raw emotions.  Throughout the song, the time signature changes several times, with variations in tempo, identifying and supporting the three different voices. The narrator begins by describing the Sniper climbing the stairs of the tower, "two bulky [[suitcase]]s hang[ing] from his hands," who then begins shooting at people on the streets below.  We hear the public's response and descriptions of the Sniper by those who knew him.  The narrator returns and this cycle begins again.  Eventually the Sniper pours out his pain over the failed relationship between himself and his mother, who had ignored him as a child.

In the end, the sniper is killed by police officers who have climbed the tower. The sniper's last words – "I was, I am, and now I will be" – lend insight into the [[psychology]] of the sniper, who has been on a lifelong quest for [[self actualization]].

'''The Scottish Short Film Festival''' is an independent film festival which has taken place annually in Scotland since 2012. From 2012 to 2017, the festival was known as The Raptor Filmz Short Scottish Film Festival until the event was rebranded in 2018. &lt;ref&gt;[https://filmfreeway.com/ScottishShortFilmFestival Festival listing on Film Freeway]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and format==

The festival was set up in 2012 by Scottish filmmaker Chris Young who is the company director of Raptor Filmz Ltd in [[West Lothian]]. The aim of the festival is to promote short Scottish films with a view of potentially setting up a distribution deal with filmmakers. The first festival took place in [[Glasgow]] at the [[Ashton Lane|Grosvenor Cinema]] and was hosted by Scottish actor [[Dave Anderson (actor)|David Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=HARBINSON|first=EDDIE|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/bathgate-set-host-short-scottish-7285835|title=Bathgate set to host Short Scottish Film Festival|work=Daily Record|date=1 February  2016|access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a desire to bring the festival closer to home, the festival was moved to the [[Howden House, West Lothian#Howden Park Centre|Howden  Park Centre]] in [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]] where the date of the festival was also moved to January 2014 rather than December 2013. In 2015, the festival found a new home at the [[Bathgate]] Regal Community Theatre which is operated by Scottish actor [[Scott Kyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=VALENTE|first=ALLAN|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/bathgates-regal-theatre-host-annual-4983931|title=Bathgate's Regal Theatre to host annual Short Scottish Film Festival|work=Daily Record|date=15 January 2015|access-date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of the Regal, festival curator Chris Young said:{{quote|"I think we’ve found our home with the Regal. It’s a great historic venue, with friendly staff, brilliant equipment, and a fantastic audience.."}}

The festival consists of awards for films and individual prizes. The awards are selected by jury with an audience choice award being decided by visitors of the festival. Jury members in the past have included actor [[Declan Michael Laird]] and film editor [[Chris Quick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishshortfilmfestival.com/apps/blog/show/45156573-chris-quick-steps-down-as-judge|title=Chris Quick Steps Down As Judge|author=|date=|work=The Scottish Short Film Festival|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, it was announced that Ross Miller, the film critic for [[The National (Scotland)|The National]] newspaper would join the judging panel.

On 30 July 2017, it was announced that the festival would return in 2018 but under the new name of The Scottish Short Film Festival. The [[Centre for Contemporary Arts]] in Glasgow was due to host the 2018 festival&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cca-glasgow.com/programme/the-scottish-short-film-festival-2018 Festival listing on Centre of Contemporary Arts page]&lt;/ref&gt; but due to the fire at the [[Glasgow School of Art]], the venue was forced to close. It was announced on the festivals twitter account that the [[Crowne Plaza Glasgow]] would take over as host.

==Filming==
The piece was filmed at Rokeby Farm, located in upstate New York, near [[Barrytown, New York|Barrytown]].

The estate has also been used by other artists, due to the unique interiors of the main house on the property.&lt;ref name=nytreview/&gt;&lt;ref name=nythouse/&gt;

==Reception==
The piece has been positively reviewed, with critics highlighting Kjartansson's focus on repetition, a recurring theme in his performances.&lt;ref name=nytreview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/66988/go-with-the-slow-ragnar-kjartanssons-the-visitors/|title=Go with the Slow: Ragnar Kjartansson’s “The Visitors”|last=Mobilio|first=Albert|date=16 March 2013|publisher=Hyperallergic|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore "Dutch" Van Kirk''' (February 27, 1921&amp;nbsp;– July 28, 2014) was a  [[navigator]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces]], best known as the navigator of the ''[[Enola Gay]]'' when it dropped the first [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] on [[Hiroshima]]. Upon the death of fellow crewman [[Morris R. Jeppson|Morris Jeppson]] on March 30, 2010, Van Kirk became the last surviving member of the ''Enola Gay'' crew.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Career==
Van Kirk was born in [[Northumberland, Pennsylvania]], and joined the [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF)|Army Air Force Aviation Cadet Program]] October 1941. On 1 April 1942, he received both his commission and navigator wings and transferred to the [[97th Operations Group|97th Bomb Group]], the first operational [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] unit in England. The crew of the "Red Gremlin" also included pilot [[Paul Tibbets]] and bombardier [[Thomas Ferebee|Tom Ferebee]]. Van Kirk would later fly with these men on the Hiroshima mission.

From August to October 1942, the crew flew 11 missions out of England. They were the lead aircraft, responsible for group navigation and bombing. In October 1942, they flew General [[Mark W. Clark|Mark Clark]] to [[Gibraltar]] for his secret North African rendezvous with the [[French Army|French]] prior to [[Operation Torch]]. In November, they ferried General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] to Gibraltar to command the North African invasion forces. After German reinforcements began pouring into the port of [[Bizerte]], [[Tunisia]], posing a serious threat to Allied strategy, a new mission emerged. On 16 November 1942, the crew led their group in an attack that took the Germans by surprise at [[Bizerte-Sidi Ahmed Air Base|Sidi Ahmed Air Base]] at Bizerte.

===Atomic bombing of Japan===
[[File:Enola-Gay-Crew.jpg|thumb|right|Van Kirk (center) and the rest of the ''[[Enola Gay]]'' flight crew upon return from their mission over [[Hiroshima]] (6 August 1945)]]
Van Kirk returned to the U.S. in June 1943 after flying a total of 58 missions overseas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1086088,00.html Theodore "Dutch" J. Van Kirk, 84], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as an instructor navigator until reuniting with Tibbets and Ferebee in the [[509th Composite Group]] at [[Wendover Air Force Base|Wendover Field]], Utah, in late 1944. The group flew the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]], with Tibbets as commander and Van Kirk as the group navigator. From November 1944 to June 1945 they trained continually for the first atomic bomb drop, which occurred 6 August 1945.

The thirteen-hour mission to Hiroshima began at 02:45 hrs in the morning [[Tinian]] time. By the time they rendezvoused with their accompanying B-29s at 0607 hrs over [[Iwo Jima]], the group was three hours from the target area. As they approached the target Van Kirk worked closely with the bombardier, Tom Ferebee, to confirm the winds and aimpoint. The bomb fell away from the aircraft at 09:15:17 Tinian time. Van Kirk later participated in [[Operation Crossroads]], the first [[Bikini Atoll]] atomic bomb tests.
According to the 1995 ''New York Times'' interview by Gustav Niebuhr Mr. Van Kirk said he was often asked, "given a choice about his role in the Hiroshima bombing, would he do it again?":&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/06/world/hiroshima-enola-gay-s-crew-recalls-the-flight-into-a-new-era.html?pagewanted=all HIROSHIMA - HIROSHIMA - Enola Gay's Crew Recalls The Flight Into a New Era - NYTimes.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the same circumstances{{snd}}and the key words are "the same circumstances"&amp;nbsp; yes, I would do it again. We were in a war for five years. We were fighting an enemy that had a reputation for never surrendering, never accepting defeat. It's really hard to talk about morality and war in the same sentence. In a war, there are so many questionable things done. Where was the morality in the [[Coventry Blitz|bombing of Coventry]], or the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]], or the [[Bataan Death March]], or the [[Nanking Massacre|Rape of Nanking]], or the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]]? I believe that when you're in a war, a nation must have the courage to do what it must to win the war with a minimum loss of lives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In October 2007, Van Kirk auctioned off the flight log he kept on board the Enola Gay during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima for [[United States dollar|US$]]358,500 in a public auction. Van Kirk stated he decided to sell the log, because he wanted it to be kept at a museum. The auction house did not reveal the name of the successful bidder, although it said it was a U.S. citizen.&lt;ref&gt;''Japan Times'' Accessed 31-October-2007 http://search.japantimes.co.jp/rss/nn20071031a8.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In August 1946 Van Kirk completed his service in the Army Air Forces as a Major. His decorations include the [[Silver Star]], the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and 15 [[Air Medal]]s. Van Kirk went on to receive his Bachelor and Master of Science degrees in [[Chemical engineering|Chemical Engineering]] from [[Bucknell University]] in 1949 and 1950. For the next 35 years, he held various technical and managerial positions in research and marketing with [[DuPont]].

Dutch Van Kirk appeared April 9–10, 2005 at the MacDill Air Force Base Air Fest, Tampa, FL, filling in for scheduled Paul Tibbets, who was ailing.

Van Kirk was present at the 2008 Thunder over Michigan Air Show.

[[Image:Dutch Van Kirk signature 2010-08-21.jpg|300px|right|autograph]]
On Friday, April 9, 2010 Van Kirk spoke at the [[University of West Georgia]] in the Biology Building Lecture Hall. It was billed as [https://web.archive.org/web/20150907002325/http://www.westga.edu/ucmassets/news/1091.php "Lone Survivor of Enola Gay Visits UWG"].

On August 21, 2010 Van Kirk appeared at a gun and knife collector's show in [[Dallas, Texas]] where his autograph was obtained, dedicated "To Wikipedia".

On September 3, 2010 Major Van Kirk, accompanied by his wife, appeared at the model air show [https://web.archive.org/web/20100905035850/http://www.gmarc.com/Warbirds2010/ "Warbirds Over Atlanta 2010"] in Ball Ground, Georgia where he signed his books and photographs as a replica of the B-29 flew overhead.

Van Kirk appeared and signed books at the [[Vectren Dayton Air Show]] on July 8, 2012.

Van Kirk appeared at the Marietta Museum of History on August 11–12, 2012.  He signed his book, ''My True Course'', from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on both Saturday and Sunday at the museum's Aviation Wing.  On Saturday, August 11 at 4 p.m., he gave a rare address at the main wing of the museum.

On September 14, 2013, Major Van Kirk visited and spoke at the [[Frontiers of Flight Museum]] in Dallas, Texas. He spoke for about an hour about his experience in the service, and afterwards, he signed copies of his book, ''My True Course''. During this event, Mr. Van Kirk relayed stories about both his practice bombing runs in America and his real bombing missions abroad. He was asked to describe the difference between the practice and real missions, and he replied, "In America, they're not shooting at you!"

On September 15, 2013, he spoke for approximately an hour and answered questions about his military service and specifically his role as the navigator on the Enola Gay at the [[Cavanaugh Flight Museum]] in [[Addison, Texas]]. Afterward, he signed copies of his book, ''My True Course''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cavanaughflightmuseum.com/index.php/component/content/article/165 Dutch Van Kirk Interview and Book Signing]". Cavanaughflightmuseum.com. 15 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Captain (Air Corps) Theodore J. Van Kirk, United States Army Air Forces, for gallantry in action while engaged in aerial flight against the Japanese Empire on 6 August 1945. Captain Van Kirk was Navigator for a combat crew of the B-29 aircraft of the [[393d Bomb Squadron|393d Bombardment Squadron]], [[509th Composite Group]], [[20th Air Force]], which flew from a base in the Marianas Islands to drop on the city of Hiroshima, Japan, the first atomic bomb to be used in warfare. Flying 1500 miles over open water to the coast of Japan, they manned their assigned positions and crossed the island of Shikoku and the Inland Sea. They constantly faced the danger of being hit by anti-aircraft fire, enemy fighters, or suffering mechanical or other failures which would intensify the risks of carrying this powerful missile. Throughout the mission the element of hazard from the unknown prevailed, for this was the first time that this bomb, much more destructive than any other in existence, had been dropped from an airplane. The effect it would have on the airplane and these crew members was only to be estimated. Shortly after 0900 they brought the plane in over the city, and at 0915 the bomb release was pressed. The bomb cleared, and fell toward the planned objective. They then headed from the area and, despite a minor effect from the detonation, returned safely to their home base. By their courage and skillful performance of duty achieved in outstanding fashion despite the dangers involved in accomplishment of this historic mission, these individuals distinguished themselves by extraordinary achievement and reflect great credit on themselves and the Army Air Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=50321 |title=Theodore J.

'''Toronto ComiCon''' (currently stylized as '''''Toronto ComiCon''''', previously as '''''toronto ComiCON''''') is an annual [[comic book]] and [[pop culture]] convention held in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]] at the [[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]] since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Toronto ComiCon {{!}}|url = http://comicontoronto.com/|website = comicontoronto.com|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
From 2001 to 2012, Hobbystar (who also ran Fan Expo Canada) held fall, spring, and winter one-day comic book conventions called the Toronto ComiCON at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. From 2004-2011, the spring event was referred to as the "Fan Appreciation Event" and included free admission held in conjunction with participating Toronto-area comic book stores such as the Silver Snail. Since 2007 the annual spring Toronto Comicon has been a multi-day event, in 2012 it expanded to incorporate the annual March Toronto AnimeCon (MTAC).

Beginning in 2012, the Toronto Comicon format underwent extensive restructuring has now become a three-day event that "[boasts] unique exhibitors, presentations, workshops and many celebrity guests."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ABOUT US {{!}} Toronto ComiCon|url = http://comicontoronto.com/about-us/|website = comicontoronto.com|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the changes, the convention has attracted more high-profile guests and attendance rates have increased, therefore making it a key competitor to its parent organizer Fan Expo Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What to expect at Toronto Comicon 2015|url = http://www.blogto.com/sports_play/2015/03/what_to_expect_at_toronto_comicon_2015/|website = blogTO|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/toronto-comicon-2015-1.2291119|title = Toronto ComiCon 2015|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victory day''' ({{lang-bn|বিজয় দিবস}} ''Bijôy Dibôs'')  is a [[public holiday|national holiday]] in [[Bangladesh]] celebrated on December 16 to commemorate the victory of the allied forces over the [[Pakistani forces]] in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. The [[Commanding officer]] of the [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani Forces]] General [[A. A. K. Niazi|AAK Niazi]] surrendered with his forces to the joint forces of [[Mukti Bahini|Bangladesh]] and [[Mitro Bahini|India]], which marked the ending of the 9 month-long&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liberationwarmuseum.org/about-us |title=About us |website=Liberation War Museum |access-date=21 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108013543/http://www.liberationwarmuseum.org/about-us |archive-date=8 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh Liberation War and [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]] and official secession of [[East Pakistan]] into Bangladesh. India also commemorates victory over Pakistan on the same day in 1971 on [[Vijay Diwas (India)|Vijay Diwas]].

==History==
[[File:1971 Instrument of Surrender.jpg|thumb|left|Signing of [[Pakistani Instrument of Surrender]] by Pakistan's Lt.Gen. [[A. A. K. Niazi]] to the commander of Allied forces Lt. Gen. [[Jagjit Singh Aurora]] in [[Dhaka]] on 16 Dec' 1971.]]
In 1971 Bangladesh fought the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] against Pakistan to become an Independent country,&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/17.htm Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the secession of [[East Pakistan]] from the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mongabay.com/history/pakistan/pakistan-the_1962_constitution.html Islamic Republic of Pakistan – The 1962 Constitution.] Retrieved on 9 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and established the sovereign nation called [[Bangladesh]]. The war pitted East Pakistan and [[India]] against [[West Pakistan]], and lasted for a duration of nine months. One of the most violent wars of the 20th century, it witnessed [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|large-scale atrocities]], the exodus of 10 million refugees and the Killing of 3 million people.&lt;ref&gt;en, Samuel; Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L. Jacobs. Dictionary of Genocide: A-L. Volume 1: Greenwood. p. 34. {{ISBN|978-0-313-32967-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 1971, [[Lieutenant General]] '''Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi''', [[Commanding Officer|CO]] of Pakistan Armed Forces located in East Pakistan signed the [[Instrument of Surrender (1971)|Instrument of Surrender]]. The Instrument of Surrender was a written agreement that enabled the surrender of the [[Evolution of Pakistan Eastern Command plan|Pakistan Eastern Command]] in the Bangladesh Liberation War, and marked the end of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] in the Eastern Theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/5312/Instrument+of+Surrender+of+Pakistan+forces+in+Dacca|title=Instrument of Surrender of Pakistan forces in Dacca|website=www.mea.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surrender took place at the [[Ramna Race Course]] in [[Dhaka]] on 16 December 1971. Lieutenant General '''Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi''' and Lieutenant General [[Jagjit Singh Aurora]], Joint Commander of [[Mitro Bahini|Indian and Bangladesh Forces]], signed the instrument amid thousands of cheering crowds at the racecourse. [[Air Commodore]] [[A. K. Khandker]], Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the [[Bangladesh Armed Forces]], and Lieutenant General [[J F R Jacob]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypost.in/editor-s-pick/55367-gen-jacob-hero-of-the-bangladesh-war-is-no-more Gen Jacob, the hero of the Bangladesh war,  is no more] – [[Daily Post India]] 13 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian Eastern Command]], acted as witnesses to the surrender. Also present were [[Vice-Admiral]] [[Mohammad Shariff]], commander of the Pakistani [[Pakistan Navy|Naval Eastern Command]] and [[Air Vice-Marshal]] Patrick D. Callaghan of the [[Pakistan Air Force]]'s Eastern Air Force Command, who signed the agreement. On behalf of Bangladesh, Air Commodore A. K. Khandker acted as witness to the surrender. Lieutenant General [[JFR Jacob|Jacob Rafael Jacob]], Chief of Staff of the Indian Eastern Command, along with the other commanders of Indian naval and air forces, acted as witnesses on behalf of India. Aurora accepted the [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] without a word, while the crowd on the race course started shouting anti-Niazi and anti-Pakistan slogans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090823045047/http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19980203/03450744.html Of betrayal and bungling by Kuldip Nayar (Google cache link)] – [[Indian Express]] 3 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the Bangladesh Bank issued a 10 Taka note with an overprint commemorating Victory Day's Silver Jubilee (the 25th anniversary).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.banknote.ws/COLLECTION/countries/ASI/BDE/BDE0032.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustsson, T., Kudweis, M., Minikevicius, J., Murcek, D., Recher, J., Vostal, L., &amp; Schmidt, T.

==Recognition of Bangladesh==
{{Main|Instrument of Surrender (1971)}}
The Surrender of [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] marked the end of the Bangladesh Liberation War and the creation of [[Bangla Desh]] (later reduced to a single word). Most [[United Nations]] member nations were quick to recognize Bangladesh within months of its independence.&lt;ref name="recog-story"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdsdf.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=3072|title=The Recognition Story|publisher=Bangladesh Strategic and Development Forum|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725050939/http://www.bdsdf.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=3072|archivedate=25 July 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=17 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebration==
The celebration of Victory Day has been taking place since 1972. The Bangladesh Liberation War became a topic of great importance in cinema, literature, history lessons at school, the mass media, and the arts in Bangladesh. The ritual of the celebration gradually obtained a distinctive character with a number of similar elements: Military Parade by [[Bangladesh Armed Forces]] at the National Parade Ground, ceremonial meetings, speeches, lectures, receptions and fireworks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/victory-day-celebrations-photos-1505866|title=Victory Day celebrations in photos|date=16 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victory Day in Bangladesh is a joyous celebration in which popular culture plays a great role. TV and radio stations broadcast special programs and patriotic songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/tv/victory-day-celebrations-channel-i-1505449|title=Victory Day celebrations at Channel i|date=16 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main streets are decorated with [[Bengali flag|national flags]]. Different political parties and socioeconomic organizations undertake programs to mark the day in a befitting manner, including the paying of respects at [[Jatiyo Smriti Soudho]], the national memorial at [[Savar]] in [[Dhaka District]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/city/victory-day-today-1505698|title=Victory Day today|date=16 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/city/victory-day-programmes-today-1330798|title=Victory Day programmes today|date=16 December 2016|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7551">'''Village files''' were military intelligence documents based on a card index system, with detailed data on every Arab village in Mandatory Palestine. Gathered by the [[SHAI]], they were the basis of Haganah and Palmah operations during the 1940s.&lt;ref name = "BlackandMorris"&gt;[[Ian Black (journalist)|Ian Black]] and [[Benny Morris]], ''[[Israel's Secret Wars: A History of Israel's Intelligence Services]]'', 2004, p.129, {{ISBN|0-8021-3286-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The files answered the need of combat intelligence for the number of men in the village, the number of weapons, the topography and so on, dealt with the research of traces of ancient Jews in the villages, and with the possibility of buying land from the villagers and settling it.&lt;ref name = "Gil Eyal"/&gt;

==Origins==
The suggestion for these files came from Luria Ben-Zion, an historian from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who wrote in 1940 to the [[Jewish National Fund]] (JNF) that "This would greatly help the redemption of the land". [[Yossef Weitz]], the head of the JNF settlement department immediately suggested that they be turned into a "national project". Yitzhak Ben-Zvi suggested that, apart from topographically recording the layout of the villages, the project should also include exposing the "Hebraic origins" of each village.&lt;ref name = "pappe"&gt;{{cite book |author= Ilan Pappé |title=The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford, England |year=2006 |pages=17–22 |isbn=1-85168-467-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ilan Pappé,&lt;ref name = "pappe" /&gt; in the early 1940s, topographers, (aerial) photographers and Orientalists worked on the files. Moshe Pasternak, who joined a data collection operation in 1940 said:

:"We had to study the basic structure of the Arab village. This means the structure and how best to attack it. In the military schools, I had been taught how to attack a modern European city, not a primitive village in the Near East. We could not compare it [an Arab village] to a Polish, or an Austrian one. The Arab village, unlike the European ones, was built topographically on hills. That meant we had to find out how best to approach the village from above or enter it from below. We had to train our 'Arabists' [the Orientalists who operated a network of collaborators] how best to work with informants."

According to Gil Eyal,&lt;ref name = "Gil Eyal"/&gt; the information was rather gathered between 1945 and 1947 when between 600 and 1000 villages were "surveyed by scouts and informers as well as aerial reconnaissance".

==Purposes==
According to Pappé,&lt;ref name = "pappe" /&gt; later the files were updated and much more details of the inhabitants were added. Towards the end of the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandatory period]] more military information was added, like the number of guards and the number and quality of arms in a village, next to the already present information on how best to attack a village. The final update in 1947 focussed on creating lists of ‘wanted’ persons in each village. The main criteria for inclusion were participation in actions against the [[United Kingdom|British]] and the [[Zionist]]s, and affiliation with a [[Palestinian Authority|Palestinian]] political party or leader. Typically 20 to 30 out of 1500 inhabitants were on the lists.

According to Pappé&lt;ref name = "pappe" /&gt; in the late 1940s these files contained 'precise details […] about the topographic location of each village, its access roads, quality of land, water springs, main sources of income, its sociopolitical composition, religious affiliations, names of its [[mukhtar]]s, its relationship with other villages, the age of individual men (sixteen to fifty),' an index of hostility based on the level of the village’s participation in the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|revolt of 1936]], and a list of everyone who had been involved in the revolt with particular attention for those who had allegedly killed Jews.

According to Eyal&lt;ref name = "Gil Eyal"&gt;Gil Eyal, ''The Disenchantment of the Orient - Expertise in Arab Affairs and the Israeli'', Stanford University Press, 2006, p.85. {{ISBN|978-0-8047-5403-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the 'village files' gathered three types of information:

* They "answered the need of combat intelligence [reporting] the number of men in the village, the number of weapons, the topography and so on";
* Other items had to do with the needs of ''[[hasbara]]'', the research of traces of ancient Jews in the villages;
* "Another interest was buying land from the villagers and settling it".

Eyal emphasizes that "the bulk of information in the files reflected the needs and point of view of the emerging Arabist expertise. (...) The Arabists could use this information to interpret the events in the village, but more importantly they could use it to act against the village and use this when needed". He points out it were used after 1948, e.g. during retaliation operations, but doesn't make any reference to a use during the [[1948 Palestine War]].&lt;ref name = "Gil Eyal"/&gt;

==Uses==
According to Pappé, during the 1948 war, after the occupation of a village, if possible, the people on the list were identified, usually by an informer wearing a cloth sack over his head, and often shot on the spot.&lt;ref name = "pappe" /&gt;

Eyal refers to the use of the 'village files' by Israeli military governors after the 1948 War. According to him, they used them in the areas conquered by Israel in order to control the mukhtars and the Arab villagers.&lt;ref&gt;Gil Eyal, ''The Disenchantment of the Orient - Expertise in Arab Affairs and the Israeli'', Stanford University Press, 2006, p.158. {{ISBN|978-0-8047-5403-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ian Black (journalist)|Ian Black]] and [[Benny Morris]] the 'village files' were also used in the 1950s by [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)|Aman]], Israel's military intelligence service, as the basis of their "intelligence on potential targets in the West Bank and the Gaza strip.".&lt;ref name = "BlackandMorris"/&gt; Eyal also refers to this use.&lt;ref&gt;Gil Eyal, ''The Disenchantment of the Orient - Expertise in Arab Affairs and the Israeli'', Stanford University Press, 2006, p.110. {{ISBN|978-0-8047-5403-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
[[Meron Benvenisti]] used the village files in his 2002 book "Sacred Landscape: Buried History of the Holy Land Since 1948", as an example showing the level of detail on one Palestinian village; [[Abu Zurayq]].&lt;ref&gt;Benvenisti, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7itq6zYtSJwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA74,M1 p.74]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter "Gulle" Oesau''' (28 June 1913 – 11 May 1944) was a German [[fighter pilot]] during [[World War II]]. A [[fighter ace]], he served in the [[Luftwaffe]] from 1934 until his death in 1944. He rose to command [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]], which was named in his honor after his death.

He served with the [[Condor Legion]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] with the [[Jagdgruppe 88|''Jagdgruppe'' 88]]. He claimed nine aircraft during the campaign, becoming one of only 28 people to earn the award of the Spanish Cross in Gold and Diamonds.

At the start of World War II, Oesau was given command of a fighter group within [[Jagdgeschwader 20|''Jagdgeschwader'' 20]]. The group took part in the [[Invasion of Poland]], later moving to the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] as the redesignated III Gruppe, [[Jagdgeschwader 51|''Jagdgeschwader'' 51]]. Oesau operated on both the Western and Eastern Fronts.

He returned to operations as commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]]. He was killed in action on 11 May 1944 aged 30. JG 1 was given the name ''"Oesau"'' in his honor.

==Early life==
Walter "''Gulle''" Oesau was born to a bank director in Farnewinkel near [[Meldorf]], Germany on 28 June 1913. He joined the German Army ([[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]) in October 1933 and served in the Second Artillery Regiment as an enlisted soldier. After being transferred to a ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' transport unit, he undertook flying training in 1934 as a cadet (''[[Fahnenjunker]]'') at the ''Luftwaffe'' Academy (''[[Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule]]'') in [[Hanover]]. Upon completion of his training he was assigned to ''Jagdgeschwader'' 132, as a ''[[Leutnant]]''. The unit was re–designated as [[Jagdgeschwader 2|''Jagdgeschwader'' 2]] "Richthofen" in May 1939.{{refn|For an explanation of the meaning of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designation see [[Luftwaffe Organization]]|group="Note"}}{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Williamson|Bujeiro|2004|pp=30–31}}

==Combat career==

===Spanish Civil War===
{{Main article|Spanish Civil War}}

[[File:Bf109C LegionCondor2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bf 109 C–1, Similar to one flown by Oesau in the Spanish Civil War.]]
Oesau started his operational career with the Condor Legion, along with future contemporary aces such as [[Werner Mölders]] and [[Adolf Galland]]. He was one of the first to join 3. [[Jagdgruppe 88|''Jagdgruppe'' 88]] in Spain in April 1938.{{refn|''Jagdgruppe'' 88, four squadrons equipped with the [[Heinkel He 51]]|group="Note"}} The ''Staffel'', commanded by [[Werner Mölders]], took part in the [[Spanish Civil War]] where Oesau claimed nine victories, flying 130 combat missions. For this he received the [[Spanish Cross]] (''Spanienkreuz'') in Gold with Diamonds. He was also wounded in this conflict which earned him the Spanish Wound Badge.
He also received the ''[[Medalla de la Campaña]]'' and the ''[[Medalla Militar]]''.{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}

===Western Front 1939–40===
{{Main article|Phoney War}}

On 1 March 1939 Oesau joined the Headquarters Flight (''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Stabsschwarm]]'') of I./JG 2. By 15 July 1939 Oesau was promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' and given command of 2./JG 20. On 15 July 1939, I./JG 20 was activated in [[Dallgow-Döberitz|Döberitz]] initially consisting of two  ''Staffeln'' drawn from JG 2. Prior to the invasion of Poland I./JG 20 was transferred to [[Strausberg]]on 26 August 1939. From there, the group was transferred to Sprottau (modern [[Szprotawa]]) anticipating an attack from the Polish Air Force. A week later the group moved to [[Brandenburg]]. On 21 February 1940, the unit was relocated to [[Alpen, Germany|Bönninghardt]] under the control of [[JG 51]]. It continued to operate in this fashion until the end of the Battle of France. On 4 July it was re–designated III./JG 51. Oesau served as ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' of 7./JG 51.{{sfn|Weal|2006|pp=15–25}}{{sfn|Sundin|Bergström|2002|p=56}}

====Battle of France====
{{Main article|Battle of France}}

Oesau got his first World War II victory during the Battle of France on 13 May 1940, when he claimed a French Curtiss [[P-36 Hawk]] over [[Halsteren]] in the Netherlands, earning him the Iron Cross 1st class ({{lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz 1. Klasse}}). On 31 May, he claimed three Spitfires during a patrol North West of [[Dunkirk]] and next day he claimed a [[Bristol Blenheim]]. On 13 June 1940, he shot down the last French aircraft kill claimed by JG 51, a French [[Amiot 143|Amiot]] bomber. By the end of hostilities in France on 25 June, his World War II tally stood at 5 (13 including Spanish kills).{{sfn|Weal|2006|pp=15–25}}{{sfn|Weal|Price|1996|pp=50–52}}

Following the Battle of France, the Luftwaffe started its attacks on Channel convoys as a prelude to the Battle of Britain. The primary task of JG 51 during this time was to provide fighter escort to these bomber missions. The commander of JG 51, ''Oberst'' Theo Osterkamp established a policy of unrestricted [[combat air patrol]] (''freie Jagd'') of fighter ''Staffeln'' providing loose protection rather than close escort to the bombers, actively seeking out [[Royal Air Force]] fighters. On 7 July 1940 Oesau claimed one Spitfire.{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Weal|2006|pp=15–25}}

====Battle of Britain====
{{Main article|Battle of Britain}}

On 10 July 1940, the first major clashes of the Battle of Britain occurred in a phase known as the ''[[Kanalkampf]]''. 20 Bf 109s of III./JG 51 led by ''Hauptmann'' [[Hannes Trautloft]] and 30 [[Bf 110]] C of I./[[Zerstörergeschwader 26|''Zerstörergeschwader'' 26]] escorted 20 [[Dornier Do 17]] bombers of II./[[Kampfgeschwader 2|''Kampfgeschwader'' 2]] attacking a large convoy off [[Folkestone]]. ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' Oesau was leading 7./JG 51.{{sfn|Weal|2006|pp=15–25}}{{sfn|Weal|Price|1996|p=68}}{{sfn|Bekker|Ziegler|1994|p=132}}

Trautloft noticed three of a flight of six intercepting [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] of [[No. 32 Squadron RAF|No. 32 squadron]] higher than the escorts, attempting to intercept the bombers. Soon they were joined by four squadrons of British fighters: [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|No. 56 Squadron]], [[No. 111 Squadron RAF|No. 111 Squadron]], [[No. 64 Squadron RAF|No. 64 Squadron]] and [[No. 74 Squadron RAF|No. 74 Squadron]]. Oesau was able to claim three Spitfires. Two 7./JG 51 aircraft crash landed in France.{{sfn|Weal|Price|1996|p=68}}{{sfn|Bekker|Ziegler|1994|p=132}}{{sfn|Foreman|2003|p=99}} British losses show that no Spitfire was lost or destroyed in the ensuing battle. Only one No. 32 Hurricane, piloted by [[Pilot Officer]] Higgs, was destroyed in a collision with one of the Do 17s and only one other Hurricane was damaged. It is possible Oesau was responsible for damaging Higgs' Hurricane, causing him to lose control. Two Spitfires landed with light damage while a third was also slightly damaged and force-landed at [[RAF Manston]]. Over claiming of enemy losses was rife on both sides during the battle.{{sfn|Mason|1969|p=158}}

On 19 July, III./JG 51 were confronted by [[Boulton Paul Defiant|Defiants]] of No. 141 Squadron south of [[Folkestone]]. As the German pilots were now aware of the Defiant's lack of forward armament, they soon gained the advantage in combat and claimed 11 Defiants shot down in 8 minutes. Oesau was credited with one Defiant, taking his score to 19. He was the first one of JG 51 to reach double digits in World War II.{{sfn|Kacha|2007}}{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Weal|2006|pp=15–25}}{{sfn|Weal|Price|1996|p=68}}{{sfn|Bekker|Ziegler|1994|p=132}} RAF losses record six Defiants destroyed and two damaged.{{sfn|Mason|1969|p=180}}

On [[The Hardest Day|18 August 1940]], III./JG 51 escorted Dorniers attacking [[RAF Hornchurch|Hornchurch airfield]]. Intercepted by Hurricanes over Kent, Oesau claimed one Hurricane shot down as his 20th victory, earning him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}) two days later, the first pilot of JG 51 to be thus honored. On 23 August 1940, Trautloft took over as ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of [[JG 54]], and Walter Oesau replaced him as ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' of III./JG 51. By October 1940, Oesau had a total score of 48 (including 26 Spitfires).{{sfn|Weal|2006|p=31}}{{sfn|Holmes|2007|p=74}}{{sfn|Miller|1997|p=30}}

On 10 November 1940 Oesau succeeded [[Wilhelm Balthasar]] as ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of III./[[JG 3]]. With 39 victories he was currently the 4th highest scoring Ace behind [[Helmut Wick]], [[Werner Mölders]] and [[Adolf Galland]]. On 5 February 1941 he shot down a Hurricane over [[Desvres]], France, his 40th victory. He was awarded the Oak Leaves (''mit Eichenlaub'') to his Knight's Cross next day. It also earned him a second entry in the ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]''. In early 1941, JG 3 returned to Germany to replace their [[Bf 109]] 'Emils' with the new 'F' variant (''Friedrich''). However, Oesau disliked the Bf 109F and kept flying his 'Emils' for some time. JG 3 returned to France in May 1941 and Oesau added two more kills on 16 May and 28 May bringing his total to 51.{{sfn|Weal|2006|pp=41–43}}{{sfn|Sundin|Bergström|2002|p=56}}{{sfn|Miller|1997|p=30}}{{sfn|Weal|1999|p=10–11}}{{sfn|Deighton|1977|p=281}}

===Operation Barbarossa===
{{Main article|Operation Barbarossa}}
Oesau's III./JG 3 was then involved in [[Operation Barbarossa]] the invasion of Russia, launched on 22 June 1941. Oesau shot down his first Soviet aircraft on 24 June 1941, and by 30 June 1941 had reached his 60th victory, downing a [[Tupolev SB]] bomber. Next day he downed three more SB bombers near Lvov (modern [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]). This earned him his 3rd entry in the Wehrmachtbericht. On 10 July 1941, Oesau claimed 5 more aircraft and two more kills by 11 July 1941. On 12 July 1941, he shot down 7 Soviet aircraft in one sortie. In the five weeks since moving to the Eastern Front, Oesau was credited with 44 Soviet aircraft downed. He became the third pilot to reach 80 victories, the 80th kill an [[Ilyushin DB-3]] bomber. He was awarded the Swords to his Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves ({{lang|de|[[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords|Ritterkreuz mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern]]}}) on same day. He was the third person to earn the Swords. He was again then wounded, receiving heavy splinter injuries in face and knee. A fortnight later he was transferred to the Western Front to take over JG 2.{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Williamson|Bujeiro|2004|pp=30–31}}{{sfn|Miller|1997|p=30}}{{sfn|Weal|2001|p=28}}

===Defence of the Reich 1941–44===

He succeeded Balthasar for the second time as JG 2 commander, who had died in combat with Spitfires over northern France when he pulled the tail off his Bf 109F in a dive. The Bf 109F-2 proved an excellent match to the Spitfire V, but Oesau disliked its reduced armament compared to the 'Emil', and continued to fly an E-4 model in preference to the Bf 109F, until lack of spares forced him to switch to the newer variant. Upon his appointment on 4 July 1941, he addressed JG 2 with the following words.{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Kay|Smith|Creek|2002|p=234}}{{sfn|Mombeek|2003}}{{sfn|Weal|2000|p=78}}

JG 2 was tasked with defending targets in occupied France against the RAF fighter offensive. For the next two years Oesau led JG 2 through the war of attrition waged by the RAF. On 10 August 1941 Oesau claimed a Spitfire for his first kill with JG 2. Over the next two days, he claimed four more Spitfires. By the end of September 1941, Oesau had claimed two more Spitfires.

JG 2 participated in the ''Luftwaffe'' air cover of the [[Channel Dash]]. Two [[B-17 Flying Fortress variants#B-17C|B-17 C Flying fortresses]] of [[No. 90 Squadron RAF|No. 90 Squadron]] attacked the German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}. In one of the highest altitude interceptions of World War II, the bombers were attacked by I./JG 2, resulting in the destruction of one. This aircraft put JG 2's score past the 800 mark, matching the score of their Great War namesake. Kills No. 88 to 92 were all Spitfires claimed between Calais and Dungeness on 12 August 1941. Oesau claimed his 100th kill on 26 October 1941, the third pilot to do so.{{refn|The first fighter pilot to claim 100 aerial victories in combat was ''Oberstleutnant'' [[Werner Mölders]] on 15 July 1941 and the second was ''Major'' [[Günther Lützow]] on 24 October 1941.{{sfn|Berger|1999|p=268}}|group="Note"}} This earned him his 4th entry in the ''Wehrmachtbericht''.{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Weal|2000|p=80}}{{sfn|Weal|1996|p=79}}

He was then grounded from flying on operations, as his experience and leadership qualities were regarded as too valuable to risk further in front line combat. He did fly on occasional sorties, the most famous involving the shooting down of a [[Lancaster bomber]] of [[No. 44 Squadron RAF]] piloted by Warrant Officer G. T. Rhodes in April 1942, during a rare RAF daylight raid on targets in [[Augsberg]]. It was his 101st kill. In August 1942, the ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Geschwaderstab]]'' of JG 2 exchanged their Bf 109 F aircraft for the [[Fw 190a#Fw 190 A-2|FW 190 A–2s]].

From late 1942 onwards JG 2 was in the front line against the increasingly numerous [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) day bomber formations of B-17s and B-24s.{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Mombeek|2003}}{{sfn|Weal|2000|p=78}}{{sfn|Weal|1996|p=21}}

Oesau added four more to his tally by mid-1943. Shortly before his 30th birthday, Oesau was elevated to a series of Luftwaffe staff and administration positions. On 1 July 1943 he was posted as Fighter Leader Brittany (''[[Jagdfliegerführer 4|''Jagdfliegerführer'' Bretagne]]''{{refn|Reformed 6 September 1943 in [[Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise|Saint-Pol]]&amp;ndash;[[Brias]] from [[Jagdfliegerführer 2|''Jagdfliegerführer'' 2]]|group="Note"}}), before being appointed as ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of JG 1 on 12 November 1943, following the death of JG 1's [[Hans Philipp]] in October 1943. The ban on Oesau's combat flying was lifted. While commanding JG 1, Oesau became an expert (''Experten'') at shooting down 4 engine bombers, with 14 bomber kills claimed. He was awarded the [[Combined Pilots-Observation Badge]] in gold and diamonds on 17 October 1943. He was awarded the [[German Cross]] in Gold on 10 January 1944.{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Weal|2000|pp=77–104}}

For Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe [[Hermann Göring]] it was an ongoing concern that inadequate numbers of fighters were able to continually engage the bomber streams, at the very time that the [[USAAF]]'s 8th Air Force's new commander, Maj. Gen. [[Jimmy Doolittle]] had instituted a [[Jimmy Doolittle#Doolittle's breakthrough in fighter tactics|new fighter strategy against the Luftwaffe]]. Hence on 23 February 1944 — near the midpoint of the USAAF's [[Big Week]] bomber offensive against the Luftwaffe, also being carried out by the [[Fifteenth Air Force#World War II|15th Air Force]] flying out of Italian bases — ''Generalmajor'' [[Joseph Schmid]] Commander of [[1st Fighter Corps (Germany)|I. ''Jagdkorps'']] established a new rule for the fighters returning to base. They were to arrive at the nearest designated fighter airfield for resupply instead of returning to their own base. They were to be commanded by the senior pilot landing on that airfield, irrespective of their unit. This was meant to turn around the fighters in time to intercept returning bombers.{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|pp=160–162}}

On next day, B-24s of [[2d Bomb Wing|2nd Bomb division]] of the [[Eighth Air Force]] bombed [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]]. JG 1 (under Oesau), JG 11 and JG 3 were sent to intercept. Due to high winds, the bombers were ahead of the escorts unprotected. Two groups of JG 1 met them before Gotha and 9 B-24s were claimed as a result. Since B-17s of [[1st Strategic Aerospace Division|1st Bomb division]] also bombed [[Schweinfurt]], other fighter units also arrived to intercept, eventually involving almost all the Western day fighter units of the Luftwaffe. This caused some confusion among pilots landing on airfields other than their own. This tested the directive of Schmid. Oesau led one of two such improvised formations successfully, with the other led by Hauptmann Borris of I./JG 26{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|pp=160–162}} Oesau added 4 fighters to his score between January and March 1944, and his tally stood at 117. On 8 May 1944 he claimed a [[P-47 Thunderbolt|Thunderbolt]] shot down over Hanover; his last kill.{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Williamson|Bujeiro|2004|pp=30–31}}

==Death==

While being the ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|JG 1]] Oesau frequently received his share of Hermann Göring's anger and frustration over the failure to beat off the Allied bomber offensive. Göring questioned the commitment of commanders who were not flying regularly and thus not really "leading" their respective units. In this context it should be stated that in order not to risk one of the Luftwaffe ''expert'''s life [German fighter aces were called ''Experten''], there was an automatic ban on Oesau for further combat flying since his 100th victory. Perhaps the ban was lifted temporarily or bypassed when he was appointed ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of JG 1.{{sfn|Sundin|Bergström|2002|p=56}} On the other hand, Oesau might simply have ignored the ban and continued to lead missions.

Oesau added several victories over American heavy bombers in the first five months of 1944. On 11 May 1944 one thousand U.S. heavy bombers from [[Eighth Air Force]] attacked railway targets in Eastern France and North East Belgium. They were escorted by even more numbers of [[P-38]] and [[P-51]] fighters. Oesau was in bed with [[influenza]]. Upon hearing the news, Göring phoned Oesau's staff:{{sfn|Sundin|Bergström|2002|p=56}}

''Göring'' – "Is the ''Kommodore'' flying?"&lt;br /&gt;
''Staff''  – "No, he is in bed with fever."&lt;br /&gt;
''Göring'' – "Yes, yes, I know that kind!", Göring said scornfully, &lt;br /&gt;
''Göring'' – "He has also turned tired and coward!"{{sfn|Sundin|Bergström|2002|p=56}}

Angered by this comment, Oesau took off in a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109 G-6/AS]] "Green 13" (Wing Number 20601) from [[Paderborn]] despite a high fever. Leading three aircraft of the ''Geschwaderstab'', the schwarm broke formation over the [[Ardennes]] as it approached the bombers. In the dogfight Oesau's wingman reported damage to his machine and he was ordered to break off. Left alone, Oesau faced [[P-38]]s and possibly [[P-51]]s as well. According to Major [[Hartmann Grasser]],  ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of III./JG 1, who was on the same mission,  there were five P-38s facing Oesau.{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Sundin|Bergström|2002|p=56}}

What followed is unclear as there are several versions. Oesau was chased by 1st Lt. James Leslie Doyle, 1st Lt. Wilbur L. Jarvis III and 1st Lt. James C. Austin, of the [[428th Fighter Squadron]] ([[474th Fighter Group|474th FG]], [[Ninth Air Force|9th AF]]). All three were experienced pilots and chased Oesau from 28,000 feet to tree-top level. In the ensuing 20 minute dogfight, Oesau defended skillfully, though his aircraft was damaged by gunfire. While attempting an emergency landing, his Gustav received a final burst of fire in the cockpit area and crashed into the ground 6 miles south west of [[St. Vith]]. His body was thrown clear of the aircraft some yards away.{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Sundin|Bergström|2002|p=56}}{{sfn|Weal|1996|p=57}}
[[File:Dithm Landesmuseum.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The ''Dithmarscher Landesmuseum'' in Meldorf.]]
According to the "Eighth Air Force Mission Folder for 11 May 1944, Mission 351", Lt. Doyle engaged in a turning dogfight with a pair of Bf 109s, scoring hits on the leader. Doyle had then broken off combat without claiming a kill, unaware that his victim, Oesau, had been killed by a 20&amp;nbsp;mm shell. Doyle's kill had been the first kill of the 474th Fighter Group in its first combat with the ''Luftwaffe''.{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=194}}

There is some dispute regarding who exactly shot down his fighter. Some sources claim that he was shot during the dogfight and while the aircraft was falling to the ground, he was shot at again a few feet above ground, possibly by the Mustangs of [[354th Operations Group|354th FG]].  Lt Wilbur Jarvis, No. 2 in the flight led by Doyle received a ''Damaged'' credit (not a kill) for Oesau's aircraft. Doyle noted bullet damage in the cockpit area and his gun camera footage showed that it was Oesau's Green 13. German records indicated that his death was caused by an explosive shell in the cockpit, his body having several bullet wounds. Later an image from the Gun camera was published (without caption) that purportedly showed Oesau's aircraft from the right side.&lt;ref&gt;"Aero-Journal", no 3, April 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle1"&gt;James L. Doyle at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oesau was aged 30 at the time of his death. He had a total of 127 kills gained over 300 missions. 27 were Spitfires, 14 four-engined bombers, 44 were scored on the Eastern Front and 9 in the Spanish Civil War. In recognition of his record, [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|JG 1]] received the title ''Oesau'' in honor of its fallen ''Geschwaderkommodore''. Only [[Werner Mölders]] had a similar honor with [[Jagdgeschwader 51|JG 51]] Mölders. Walter Oesau is buried in [[Meldorf]], close to his birthplace and the town museum (''Dithmarscher Landesmuseum'') has documented his last journey in pictures.{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Williamson|Bujeiro|2004|pp=30–31}}{{sfn|Sundin|Bergström|2002|p=56}}{{sfn|Miller|1997|p=30}}

==Aftermath==

[[Johannes Steinhoff]], the high-ranking Luftwaffe ace (176 Kills) who went on to become the Chief of Staff for Allied Air Forces in Central Europe, once said: "Walter ''Gulle'' Oesau was the toughest fighter pilot in the Luftwaffe".{{sfn|Sundin|Bergström|2002|p=56}}

In 1940, frustrated with the perceived lack of success against RAF Fighter Command, Göring was keen on infusing the fighter force leadership with younger blood. He perceived a lack of aggressiveness in the Jagdgeschwader leadership. The likes of Theo Osterkamp were the first victim of this policy, handing over JG 51 to Werner Mölders. Oesau was considered to be one such rising star. However, being a star and staying in Göring's favor required keeping up the kill rate and promotions were invariably linked to scores. According to Dr. [[Kurt Tank]], the Focke–Wulf designer, although many of the younger generation were good flyers, they were unable to cope with problems of overall planning and broader strategic aspects. However, Oesau was one of the outstanding leaders ever produced by Luftwaffe fighter wings with the likes of [[Werner Mölders]] and Adolf Galland.{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Townsend|2000|p=339}}

The decision to continually retain or return gifted experts (''Experten'') to front line battle proved extremely costly, resulting in the death in combat of many of the earlier experts and aces. This, coupled with the acute shortage of well trained pilots and the fact that by 1943 they were facing a better equipped and well-trained enemy, meant the life expectancy of even the most gifted was tragically short. Author John Weal says that, although other Geschwaderkommodore would end up dying in combat, nothing would showcase the changing fortunes of Luftwaffe fighter forces than the death of Walter Oesau.{{sfn|Weal|1999|pp=70–71}}

==Personality and personal life==

German historian Hans Otto Böhm commented on Oesau as "One of my best professors". There is little information available on the personal side of Walter Oesau. He had good sense of humor and liked to spend time with his friends. He was a simple man, who did not display any flamboyant personal emblems on his aircraft. His aircraft while commanding JG 2 did not have any special markings except for the unit's normal yellow under–cowling. While Oesau commanded, JG 2, like many others, dropped the special symbols for Stab (headquarters flight) units in favor of numerals. This helped make the leader's aircraft anonymous. Unlike other aces, Oesau reportedly never had markings on his rudder representing his personal tally, although this is contradicted by some photos displaying what may be his aircraft rudder painted with score of downed aircraft. The authenticity of the photograph is questioned by some as there are also [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87]] photos supposedly signed by Oesau (he never flew a ''Stuka'' bomber).{{sfn|Weal|2000|p=125}}{{sf|Toliver|Constable|1996|p=352}}
