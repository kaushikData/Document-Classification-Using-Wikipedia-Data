The '''Graff Diamonds robbery''' took place on 6 August 2009 when two men posing as customers entered the premises of [[Graff Diamonds]] in [[New Bond Street]], London and stole jewellery worth nearly £40 million (US$65 million).&lt;ref name="davenport"&gt;Davenport, Justin.

The robbers used the services of a professional [[make-up artist]] to alter their skin tones and their features using latex [[Prosthetic makeup|prosthetics]] and to be fitted with professional wigs.&lt;ref name="edwards2"&gt;Edwards, Richard.

On 6 August 2009 at 4:40&amp;nbsp;pm, two sharply dressed men arrived at the Graff Diamonds jewellery store by [[taxicab|taxi]] and once inside produced two handguns which they used to threaten staff. They made no attempt to conceal their faces from the premises' [[CCTV]] cameras due to their elaborate disguises. Even though one of the robbers was wearing [[leather gloves]], store security allowed him entry, being used to the eccentric behaviour of some super-wealthy clients.

Petra Ehnar, a shop assistant, was forced at gunpoint to empty the store's display cabinets. A total of 43 rings, bracelets, necklaces and watches were taken. She was briefly held hostage at gunpoint and was forced into the street during the getaway. She testified that the robbers told her that she would be killed if she did not carry out their demands.&lt;ref name="tol8"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/aug/06/graff-diamonds-robber-jailed Graff Diamonds robber Aman Kassaye jailed for 23 years] ''The Guardian''. (6 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; After releasing the hostage outside the store, one of the robbers fired a shot into the air to create confusion, and both escaped the scene in a blue [[BMW]] vehicle. This vehicle was abandoned in nearby Dover Street, where a second gunshot was fired into the ground while the robbers switched to a second vehicle, a silver [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]]. They again switched vehicles in Farm Street, after which there was no further information regarding their whereabouts.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

All of the diamonds had been laser-inscribed with the Graff logo and a [[Gemological Institute of America]] identification number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graffdiamonds.com/_html/index.php?sectionid=1&amp;pgid=26&amp;diamondstyleid=5 Diamond – "The Certificate"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711122052/http://www.graffdiamonds.com/_html/index.php?sectionid=1&amp;pgid=26&amp;diamondstyleid=5 |date=11 July 2011 }}. Graff Diamonds. Retrieved 12 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Detectives investigating the robbery stated: "They knew exactly what they were looking for and we suspect they already had a market for the jewels." The suspects' details were circulated to all ports and airports but police believed they would have an elaborately prepared escape route and had already left the country.&lt;ref name=edwards /&gt;

The robbery was being investigated by [[Barnes, London|Barnes]] [[Flying Squad]], headed by [[Detective Chief Inspector]] Pam Mace.

===Financial loss to Graff Diamonds===

The financial loss to Graff Diamonds was more than US$10 million (£6.6 million). The actual value of the pieces for insurance purposes, was put at $39 million (£26 million). But according to Nicholas Paine, the company secretary, the syndicate that insured Graff was only liable for $28.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/06/graff-loses-10m-result-robbery Graff lose over £6m as result of robbery] ''The Guardian''. (6 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests and charges==
The robbers were caught shortly after police searched one of the getaway cars abandoned by the robbers. A pay-as-you go mobile phone was discovered that robbers Aman Kassaye and Craig Calderwood left in the car after ramming into a black cab. After the collision, in their haste to transfer to a second vehicle, the robbers forgot the mobile phone that was wedged between the driver's seat and the handbrake. Anonymous numbers stored on the mobile phone quickly allowed police to discover the identity of the robber.

On 20 August 2009, two men, Craig Calderwood, 26, of [[no fixed abode]], and Solomun Beyene, 24, of Lilestone Road, London NW8, were [[Indictment|charged]] in connection with the robbery.&lt;ref name=BBC20Aug09&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8212981.stm |title=Two charged over £40m jewel raid  |publisher=BBC News |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 August, a third man, Clinton Mogg, 42, of Westby Road, [[Bournemouth]], was also charged, and Calderwood and Beyene were remanded in custody by Westminster Magistrates' Court.&lt;ref name=BBC21Aug09&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8214004.stm |title=Third man charged over jewel raid |publisher=BBC News |date=21 August 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August, Mogg appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court.

On 7 August 2010, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/08/07/graff-diamond-armed-robber-gets-23-years-in-prison-115875-22470632 Graff Diamond armed robber gets 23 years in prison], ''Daily Mirror'', (7 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Three other men – Solomun Beyene, 25, of London, Clinton Mogg, 43, of Bournemouth, and Thomas Thomas, 46, of Kingston upon Thames – were each jailed for 16 years after also being convicted of conspiracy to rob.&lt;ref name="tol8"/&gt; Craig Calderwood was finally jailed for 21 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As of March 2011, none of the stolen jewellery has been recovered. Experts believe the jewellery has probably been broken up so the precious stones could be anonymously resold after being recut.&lt;ref name="tol8"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4722">[[File:Nenačovice, tabulka Akce-Z.jpg|thumb|right|A plaque that says that the building was constructed in course of ''Akce Z'']]

"Initiative Z" was the Czechoslovak communist regime's attempt to tap a volunteer work and community spirit toward supplementing local infrastructure and public facility improvement using volunteer work while the construction material and the logistics were provided by the government.

In [[Communist Czechoslovakia]], '''Initiative Z''' ({{lang-cs|Akce Z}}) was a nationwide program of a volunteer, community-improvement unpaid manual labor by population, which was officially recognized as [[Volunteering|volunteer]] work which run for several decades, mainly on the projects where the 5-year planned economy was in a substantial delay.

Specific local plans with Initiative Z community-improvement projects were usually announced by a local ''[[:cs:Národní výbor (1945-1990)|Národní výbor]]'' ("[[People's Committee (Czechoslovakia)|People's Committee]]", i.e. an elected city council-like local government administrative body). Larger projects undertaken within the  Initiative Z have eventually found their place into the nationwide [[planned economy|state plans of economic development, such as Five-Year Plans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexdata.cz/lexdata/sb_free.nsf/c12571cc00341df1c12566af007f1a09/c12571cc00341df1c12566d40071fc2f?OpenDocument Notice 6/1960 of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Finance and State Bank]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, see sections 15, 18 {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was done outside the regular work hours, very often on Saturday morning and was somehow similar to ''[[subbotnik]]s'' in the [[Soviet Union]] or standard community-action or community-improvement initiatives and programs in the West.&lt;ref&gt;''The Czechoslovak Cooperator'', Issues 3-4, [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=JRooAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=czechoslovakia+%22action+z%22&amp;q=%22action+z%22#search_anchor p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was meant to be entirely voluntary work, the names of volunteers and a number of worked hours were duly documented. Those citizens who did not participate and their names therefore did not figure on the lists, were questioned, why they did not come to contribute and in many cases put under an unpleasant pressure by mentioning possible disadvantages such as a reduced choice with respect to future education or difficult change of employer.

Those citizens who worked the most hours were publicly recognized and there was an award-system which gave those who contributed more than 50 hours in a given year a Silver Akce Z Pin and those with more than 100 hours a Golden Akce Z Pin. Many, especially young people, earned - over the years - several of these and mentioned the fact say in applications for university admission.

"Z" stands for the Czech word ''zvelebování'', "improvement", referring to improvement of public places. Typical activities ranged from garbage removal and planting trees to construction of some public-service facilities, such as children [[playground]]s, [[cultural center]]s (Kulturní domy, Houses of Culture), municipal pipelines or sewage lines, large number of grocery stores in small villages (for example grocery store [[Smíšené Zboží]] in village ([[Hůrky]] coordinates 49.049331 N ,15.133108 E) near [[Nová Bystřice]]) etc..

In the late 1980s when the planned economy was in the latest phase of its struggle, even technically advanced projects were attempted to be progressed by sending numbers of unskilled volunteers to help under the umbrella of '''Initiative Z'''. However, the lack of skills among volunteers often resulted in contra-productive outcome and faulty results of volunteer work, although well hidden, regularly led to even longer delays. Many participants recalled futile work be ordered upon them, for illustration having to shuffle a large heap of sand with shovels and wheelbarrows the whole day by 20 meters, just to witness it being relocated by a machine to its original location in the following working days.

Under any regime always sceptical, Czech folk wit claimed that "Z" stood for ''zdarma'', i.e., "without pay".&lt;ref name=from&gt;"From Good King Wenceslas to the Good Soldier Švejk: a dictionary of Czech Popular Culture ", by Andrew Lawrence Roberts, {{ISBN|963-7326-27-8}}, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6qlnrXT2yS0C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22akce+z%22&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=%22akce%20z%22&amp;f=false p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Blundellsands]], [[Lancashire]], and died in [[Scorton, Lancashire]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abps.org.uk/Awards/Roll_of_Distinguished_Philatelists/RDP_Background_20111231_LR.pdf Background notes on The Roll of Distinguished Philatelists September 2011]'', Roll of Distinguished Philatelists Trust, London, 2011. [https://www.webcitation.org/6OlHSBOTl Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caroe was chairman of the [[Trustee Savings Banks Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KJZAAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2986%2C4683798 | title=Savings banks want to enter personal loan stakes | first=David | last=Jones | newspaper=The Glasgow Herald | date=24 February 1972 | page=15 | accessdate=16 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; honorary president of the EEC Savings Bank Group and a director of the [[Norwich Union|Norwich Union Group]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. He was Chairman on Minton Limited until its sale to Royal Doulton in 1968.  Caroe was also consul for Denmark and Iceland in Liverpool.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

He was appointed a [[Knight Bachelor]] in January 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kNE9AAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1563%2C117816 | title=Five Scots among 34 new knights | date=3 January 1972 | newspaper=The Glasgow Herald | page=9 | accessdate=16 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Caroe married twice, first to Frances Mary Lyon on 6 April 1934 (Mary was descended from Thomas Minton and Colin Minton Campbell) they two sons Charles Frederick Caroe (13 May 1935 to 1 August 2012) and Andrew Minton Campbell. Mary died from polio in 1948.  Athelstan married Doreen Evelen Jane Sandland in 1952 (known as Jane). They had three children Clarissa, John and Patrick. Jane died in Lancaster, 21 April 2003.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} John died at birth and Patrick in 2014 at the age of 49.

==Philately==
In his spare time, Caroe was a noted [[philatelist]] who was added to the [[Roll of Distinguished Philatelists]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abps.org.uk/Home/Who_Was_Who/index.xalter#C | title=Who Was Who in Philately | publisher=The Association of British Philatelic Societies | accessdate=16 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Athelstan was an able tennis player in his youth competing in mixed double at county level with his wife Mary, no doubt helped by his height (6'5").

'''Beijing Benz''' (officially '''Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd''') is an [[Automotive industry|automotive]] manufacturing company headquartered in [[Beijing]], [[China]], and a [[joint venture]] between [[BAIC Motor]] and [[Daimler AG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mercedes-benz.com.cn/content/china/mpc/mpc_china_website/enng/home_mpc/passengercars/home/passengercars_world/about_company/daimler.html|title=Daimler Northeast Asia |publisher=Mercedes-Benz China |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dameofficial&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ar2009.daimler.com/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes/2-significant-acquisitions-and-dispositions-of-interests-in-companies-and-of-other-disposals-of-assets-and-liabilities.html |title=2009 Annual Report, 2.

Originally established in 1984 as Beijing Jeep Corporation ({{zh|s=北京吉普汽车有限公司}}) by BAIC Motor with [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC), it was the first Chinese auto-making joint venture with a Western partner. It continued after AMC was acquired by Chrysler in 1987 and after Chrysler merged with German automaker Daimler-Benz AG in 1998.

As of 2016, Beijing Benz assembles and manufactures the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class]] (long wheelbase), and [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class|C-Class]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;For assembly of vehicles, see {{cite web |url=http://ar2009.daimler.com/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes/34-related-party-relationships.html |title=2009 Annual Report, 34.

==History==
The history of this company goes back to Beijing Jeep Corporation (BJC), which was the first Sino-foreign automobile joint venture in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher |first=Kevin |title=Handbook on Trade and the Environment |year=2010 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=9781848446045 |page=152 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=LpHiobgEuMgC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=Beijing+Jeep+Corporation+(BJC)+was+the+first+Sino-foreign+automobile+joint+venture+in+China |accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a prototype for future cooperative projects and BJC became a test case revealing problems, both political and economic, that would appear for other investors the Chinese hoped to attract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harwit |first=Eric |title=China's Automobile Industry: Policies, Problems and Prospects: Policies, Problems and Prospects |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781315286792 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=aooYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT68&amp;lpg=PT68&amp;dq=The+company+would+be+a+test+case,+one+that+would+reveal+the+kinds+of+problems,+both+political+and+economic,+that+would+appear+for+other+investors+the+Chinese+hoped+to+attract |accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Motors===

Beijing Benz grew out of what was originally the Beijing Jeep Corporation ({{zh|s=北京吉普汽车有限公司}}), China's first Sino-western automotive [[joint venture]] having been established in 1984 with [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]].&lt;ref name="cd"/&gt;

American Motors began negotiations in 1979 to sell its vehicles in China and gain access to then low-cost Chinese labor.&lt;ref name=manngeneric&gt;{{cite book| last=Mann |first=Jim |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=zss6RUl6UDYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=beijing%20jeep%20a%20case%20study%20of%20western%20business%20in%20china |title=Beijing Jeep: A Case Study of Western Business in China |publisher=Westview Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8133-3327-4 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese wanted more-modern automotive technology; Beijing Jeep suited the needs of both parties and produced the American Motors [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]] in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name=manngeneric/&gt; While talks began in the late 1970s, operation started in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Doing business in China: the last great market - Page 192 Geoffrey Murray - 1994 "BEIJING JEEP Finally in this chapter, I want to return to the ongoing story of Beijing Jeep.

A few Chrysler models were subsequently added to the Chinese company's product line including the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]], [[Mitsubishi Pajero Sport]], and the [[Mitsubishi Outlander]], as well as some Beijing Jeep-branded, locally developed vehicles.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} Chrysler no longer had any ownership in Beijing Jeep as of early 2009 due to the failure of its [[Daimler AG#Merger with Chrysler|attempt to acquire the maker of Mercedes-Benz models]].

===Daimler AG===
During Chrysler's short-lived partnership with Daimler AG, maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, production at Beijing Jeep was expanded to include Mercedes-Benz-branded products. Its legal name was changed to Beijing Benz-DaimlerChrysler Automotive Co Ltd,&lt;ref name=cd/&gt; with then [[German Chancellor]] [[Gerhard Schroeder]] in attendance at the 2004 naming ceremony.&lt;ref name=cd&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-12/07/content_397951.htm |first= Yu |last=Qiao |title=JV renamed Beijing Benz-DaimlerChrysler |newspaper=China Daily |date=7 December 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Chrysler was removed from the company in 2009, it remained in its legal name&lt;ref name="pullout"/&gt; for several more years.

The company started producing the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class]] locally in 2006 and the [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class|C-Class]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=fut/&gt; Manufacture of Chrysler-branded models continued until at least 2008.&lt;ref name=orac/&gt; This included the 300C and Sebring, which were both locally produced and imported.&lt;ref name=important&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-06/07/content_889631.htm |title=Beijing Benz-DaimlerChrysler recalls defective sedans |agency=Xinhua |newspaper=China Daily |date=7 June 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2010, the E-Class was assembled from [[knock-down kit]]s with a low localization rate of about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;For knock-down assembly of E-Class, see "China's domestically-made Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedans to get off the line in Beijing". ''China Business News''. Shanghai: May 31, 2010.

Incidentally, Daimler had previously cooperated with [[FAW Group]] to produce the then-recently discontinued [[Mercedes-Benz W123]] (200 and 230E) sedans although these did not prove popular.

[[File:Borel &amp; Co building - San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Building in 2017]]
The '''Borel &amp; Co.''' building is a small, two story, granite-faced, steel frame building at 440 Montgomery in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. The city designated it [[List of San Francisco Designated Landmarks|San Francisco Landmark]] number 109 on April 6, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://default.sfplanning.org/Preservation/bulletins/HistPres_Bulletin_09.PDF |title=San Francisco Landmarks |series=San Francisco Preservation Bulletin, Appendix A to Article 10 List of Designated Landmarks |number=9 |page=1384 |publisher=San Francisco Planning Department |date=January-March 2014 |format=PDF |access-date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Borel Company Building was commissioned by Switzerland born banker and diplomat, [[Antoine Borel]]. Although he generally thought of as a commercial bank, the type of service offered was more closely related to investment services. Borel held directorates in the [[California-Oregon Power Company]], the [[Los Angeles Railway|Los Angeles Railroad]], The [[San Francisco Public Utilities Commission|Spring Valley Water Company]], and the [[Bank of California]]. In 1884, Borel organized a syndicate to purchase the [[California Street Cable Railroad|California Street Cable Car]] line which had been in operation since 1878. It was largely through Borel's efforts that the company expanded its operations by construction of the [[Hyde Street Line]].

==Design==
The building was designed by [[Albert Pissis]], It exemplifies the [[Beaux Arts architecture]] commercial classicism strongly evident in the reconstruction of downtown San Francisco following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake and fire]].
 
The Corinthian façade begins the colonnaded parade of temple banks that runs northward from [[Montgomery Street]] to [[Columbus Avenue (San Francisco)|Columbus Avenue]]. The building is only 27.5 feet wide, and while this narrow façade offered less opportunity for innovation than would a larger street frontage, it demanded greater innovation to achieve architectural excellence.

'''Business reporting''' or '''enterprise reporting''' refers to both "the public reporting of operating and financial data by a business enterprise,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lymer|first=Andrew|title=BUSINESS REPORTING ON THE INTERNET|url=http://www.cs.trinity.edu/rjensen/Calgary/CD/iasb/busrepw.pdf|accessdate=Nov 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the regular provision of information to decision-makers within an organization to support them in their work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Gregory|title=a guide to enterprise reporting|url=http://ghill.customer.netspace.net.au/reporting/definition.html|accessdate=Nov 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fundamental part of the larger movement towards improved [[business intelligence]] and [[knowledge management]].{{According to whom|date=October 2018}} Implementation often involves [[Extract, transform, load|extract, transform, and load]] (ETL) procedures in coordination with a [[data warehouse]] and then using one or more [[List of reporting software|reporting tools]].{{cn|date=October 2018}} Reports can be distributed in print form, via [[email]] or accessed via a corporate [[intranet]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

With the expansion of [[information technology]] there has been an increase in the production of unified reports which join different views of an organization in one place.&lt;ref&gt;Moeller, Robert (2007). COSO Enterprise Risk Management: Understanding the New Integrated ERM Framework. Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-74115-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This reporting process involves querying data sources with different [[logical data model|logical model]]s to produce a [[human readable]] report. For example, a decision maker may need to query a [[human resources]] databases and a [[Capital improvement plan|capital improvements]] databases to show how efficiently space is being used across an entire corporation.

Reporting can also be used for verification and cross-checks. Audit teams like FINRA and SEC adhere to reports for all business firms. [[Standard Business Reporting]] is a group of international programs instigated by a number of governments with the end of make business the centre when it comes to managing business-to-government reporting obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies''' (also known as '''SLU''') is a public undergraduate, graduate, and professional school in [[New York City]] associated with the [[City University of New York]] system. Founded in 2018 as an outgrowth of the [[CUNY School of Professional Studies|Joseph S. Murphy Institute for Worker Education and Labor Studies]], the Murphy Institute is now one of incorporated programs at the School of Labor and Urban Studies, which provides undergraduate and graduate degrees in Labor Studies and Urban Studies, as well as certificate programs and [[workforce development]] for members of labor unions.&lt;ref name=school_facts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.cuny.edu/sites/lus/about/school-facts/ |title=School Facts |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018 |website=CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies |publisher=City University of New York |access-date=July 30, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies was established in 2018 as an outgrowth of the Joseph S. Murphy Institute for Worker Education and Labor Studies, otherwise known as The Murphy Institute. The Murphy Institute was first established in 1984 at [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] in collaboration with three New York City labor unions for the purposes of providing worker education to labor union members.&lt;ref name=school_facts /&gt; In 2005, the Murphy Institute was incorporated into CUNY's School of Professional Studies, expanding to provide undergraduate and graduate degrees.&lt;ref name=dean&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.cuny.edu/sites/lus/about/welcome/ |title=Welcome From the Dean |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018 |website=CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies |publisher=City University of New York |access-date=July 30, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though New York labor unions had been petitioning for the Murphy Institute to become its own stand-alone school since 2012, when the New York State [[AFL-CIO]] passed a resolution endorsing the proposal, it was only until Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] added $1.5 million to the state budget in 2018 that funding was available.&lt;ref name=nypost&gt;{{cite news |last=Campanile |first=Chris |date=March 26, 2018 |title=Cuomo’s budget includes plan to create CUNY school focused on unions |url=https://nypost.com/2018/03/26/cuomos-budget-includes-plan-to-create-cuny-school-focused-on-unions/ |work=[[New York Post]] |location=New York City |access-date=July 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty==
As of 2018, CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies employs fifteen faculty, some of whom have shared appointments with other universities in the CUNY system.&lt;ref name=faculty&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.cuny.edu/sites/lus/about/faculty/ |title=Faculty |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018 |website=CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies |publisher=City University of New York |access-date=July 30, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the faculty include:

Commissioning is the process of assuring that all systems and components of a building or industrial plant are designed, installed, tested, operated, and maintained according to the operational requirements of the owner or final client.

For large projects, this process usually comprises planning, execution, and control of hundreds of thousands of inspection and test activities on “commissionable objects”, such as instruments, equipment, skids, [[Modular design|modules]], [[Electronic circuit|circuits]], loops, [[subsystems]], and [[systems]]. In this case, the large volume and complexity of commissioning data, and the need to guarantee information traceability, normally require the use of powerful IT tools, known as '''commissioning management systems''' or '''completion management systems'''.

Although these systems allow effective planning and monitoring of [[Project commissioning|commissioning]] activities, as well as logging of all evidences necessary to the process they are not without a cost, as annual, monthly or per user licence fees and can typically range from upwards of 10000 USD/year to 5 USD/day/user. The design of these systems can also vary greatly, from rich native applications that need to be installed on a computer to lightweight web-based systems that can be accessed from any web browser or mobile solutions that only require a smartphone to access the relevant information. Choosing one of these solutions is entirely dependent on the needs of the project and its users due to specific benefits and drawbacks from choosing either.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2360">A '''custom online panel''' or Internet '''access panel''' is a group of pre-screened respondents who have expressed a willingness to participate in [[Paid survey|survey]]s and/or [[customer feedback]] sessions. The custom online panel is also known as a customer advisory panel, proprietary panel or an online research panel. Respondents become "panelists" by completing a [[Demographic profile|profiling]] [[questionnaire]]. The data collected includes [[demographics]], [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] characteristics and media habits, which provides a basis for future survey participation.

== Form and process ==
A panel can range in size from 100 to 100,000 or more people. Larger panels can enable surveys of smaller target groups. Panel quality is not determined solely by size, however, and how panel members have been sourced is also important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26 Questions to Help Research Buyers of Online Samples|url=http://www.esomar.org/uploads/public/knowledge-and-standards/codes-and-guidelines/ESOMAR_26-Questions-To-Help-Research-Buyers-Of-Online-Samples.pdf|publisher=ESOMAR|accessdate=19 September 2013|page=2|format=PDF|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Panels can provide a dedicated group that market researchers can engage with and learn from over time. At a moment’s notice researchers can investigate the [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[behaviour]] and [[opinion]]s of existing or potential customers using interactive surveys, discussion forums and 3D retail environments. Plus, results are available instantly and responses can be tracked over time.

Panels are a growing phenomenon in the [[market research]] industry. They bridge the gap between a population that is reluctant to cooperate with telephone surveys and the organizations that need to know their perceptions and attitudes more than ever before.

A specialized form of online panels typically known as [[Expert network|Expert Networks]] are used by investment funds and consulting firms to collect information as well.

'''Daedeok Innopolis''', formerly known as '''Daedeok Science Town''', is the research and development district in the [[Yuseong-gu]] district in [[Daejeon]], [[South Korea]]. Daedeok Innopolis grew out of the research cluster established by President [[Park Chunghee]] in 1973 with the opening of the [[KAIST]]. Over 20 major research institutes and over 40 corporate research centers make up this science cluster. Over the last few years, a number of IT venture companies have sprung up in this region, which has a high concentration of Ph.Ds in the applied sciences. There are 232 research and educational institutions to be found in Daejeon, many in the Daedeok region, among them the [[Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute]] and the [[Korea Aerospace Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.metro.daejeon.kr/english/investdaejeon/daedeokvalley/daedeoksciencetown.jsp  |title=Daedeok Science Town  |accessdate=2007-02-21  |publisher=Daejeon Metropolitan City  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118140735/http://www.metro.daejeon.kr/english/investdaejeon/daedeokvalley/daedeoksciencetown.jsp  |archivedate=2006-11-18  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "town" will provide a core for the [[International Science and Business Belt]].

== History ==
DISCOVERY Children’s Museum was formerly Lied Discovery Children’s Museum, which was founded by Robin Greenspun and Mark Tratos, who arranged a partnership between the Junior League of Las Vegas and the Allied Arts Council founding a nonprofit educational institution in 1984. In 1985, a bond issued to authorize the building of the [[Las Vegas–Clark County Library District|Las Vegas-Clark County Library]] and Lied Discovery Children’s Museum, which opened its doors on September 9, 1990.&lt;ref name=sun/&gt;&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{citation|title=Discovery Children's Museum History|publisher=Discovery Children's Museum|url=http://www.discoverykidslv.org/about-us/|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relocation ===
In 2010 the museum announced plans to construct and occupy a new home and larger home in [[Symphony Park]].&lt;ref name=plans&gt;{{cite news |title=Children’s museum plans for Smith Center expansion |first=Erin |last= Dostal |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |date=August 11, 2010 |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/aug/11/childrens-museum-plans-smith-center-expansion/ |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total for the Donald W.

'''Downtown Baltimore''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Baltimore]] traditionally bounded by [[Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (Baltimore)|Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard]] to the west, [[Mt. Royal Avenue]] to the north, [[President Street (Baltimore)|President Street]] to the east and the [[Inner Harbor]] area to the south.  It consists of five neighborhoods: Westside, Mount Vernon, City Centre, Inner Harbor, and Camden Yards.

In 1904, downtown Baltimore was almost destroyed by a [[Great Baltimore Fire|huge fire]] with damages estimated at $150 million. Since the City of Baltimore was chartered in 1796, this downtown nucleus has been the focal point of business in the [[Baltimore metropolitan area]].  It has also increasingly become a heavily populated neighborhood with over 37,000 residents and new condominiums and apartment homes being built steadily.

==Geography==
City Center is the historic financial district in Baltimore that has increasingly shifted eastward and into the Inner Harbor.  Hundreds of businesses are found here, and it remains the center of life in Baltimore.  The area is home to the majority of Baltimore's [[skyscraper]]s including the [[Bank of America Building (Baltimore)|Bank of America building]], the [[M&amp;T Bank Building]], the [[Transamerica Tower]], the [[Baltimore World Trade Center]], the [[100 East Pratt Street|old IBM building]], and the massive [[Charles Center]] district. It includes historic [[Maryland Route 139|Charles Street]] as well as significant avenues of commercial and cultural activity along [[Pratt Street]], east to west, and [[St. Paul Street-Calvert Street]], north to south.

The [[Inner Harbor]] is the chief commercial and tourist destination in Baltimore, {{Citation needed span|visited by over 13 million people a year.|date=April 2007}} The Inner Harbor features a large number of restaurants, hotels, retail areas (such as [[Harborplace]]), and entertainment (such as [[Power Plant Live!]]). It was named by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' as one of the best summer trips in 2012 (along with all of Baltimore in general). The Inner Harbor is also home to a variety of museums and scientific institutions such as the [[Maryland Science Center]], the [[National Aquarium in Baltimore]], the [[Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History &amp; Culture]], the [[Flag House &amp; Star-Spangled Banner Museum]], [[Port Discovery (museum)|Port Discovery children's museum]], and Living Classroom environmental education centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/best-trips-summer-2012/#/baltimore-maryland-summer-trips_52791_600x450.jpg Best Summer Trips 2012 - National Geographic]. Travel.nationalgeographic.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Like much of Baltimore, the area features historic, often industrial, buildings from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that have been repurposed for modern industry and residences, including the [[Pratt Street Power Plant]] which was built in 1900 and now hosts a [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] bookstore, the Baltimore [[Hard Rock Cafe]], and other retail tenants.

[[File:DowntownPartnership.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Street headquarters of the Partnership for Downtown Baltimore]]
Westside Baltimore is the western portion of downtown Baltimore that includes Market Center and many of the newest developments in downtown Baltimore, including the [[Baltimore Convention Center]]. It is also home to the site of the "Superblock" project that will include hundreds of condos and apartments as well as a variety of retail and commercial space.  The former home of Baltimore's many and famed department stores, Westside Baltimore is now anchored by the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore]] consisting of the University of Maryland Health System, [[University of Maryland School of Law]] and the University of Maryland Biopark. The Westside is also home to several performing arts centers, including the [[Hippodrome Theatre (Baltimore)|Hippodrome Theatre]], [[Royal Farms Arena]], and the [[Everyman Theatre, Baltimore|Everyman Theatre]]. [[G. Krug &amp; Son Ironworks and Museum]], in its original location, is the oldest continually operating blacksmith shop in the United States as well as a museum.

The former home of famed American writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]] is located at the [[Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum]], a few blocks northwest from his grave at the intersection of Greene and Fayette streets. Nearby is the historic [[Lexington Market]], one of the longest-running markets in the world, having been founded in 1782 and in continual operation since, selling a variety of prepared foods and groceries.

[[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon]], also known as the cultural district, is a high-density area known for its attractive [[nightlife (activity)|nightlife]], buoyed by its large amount of bars, clubs and lounges and its historic multi-story townhomes (most of which have been transformed into apartments) and traditional apartment buildings. Mount Vernon features the [[Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall]], home of the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]], as well as the [[Lyric Opera House]]. The world-renowned [[Peabody Institute]] is also located in Mount Vernon adjacent to the [[Walters Art Museum]]. To the very north is [[Pennsylvania Station (Baltimore)|Penn Station]], which offers [[Amtrak]] service to several U.S. major cities as well as [[MARC Train|MARC]] service to [[Washington, D.C.]] A major north-south avenue in Mount Vernon is Cathedral Street, named for the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Baltimore)|National Shrine of the Assumption]], the first Catholic cathedral built in the United States, which is also considered the masterpiece of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], the "father of American architecture" and famed creator of the [[U.S. Capitol]].

Downtown Baltimore also contains Camden Yards, which includes the well-known home of the [[Baltimore Orioles]], [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], and [[M&amp;T Bank Stadium]], home of the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. Nearby are the [[Sports Legends Museum at Camden Yards]], the now-closed [[Geppi's Entertainment Museum]], and the [[Babe Ruth#Memorial and museum|Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum]].

==Transportation==
Downtown Baltimore offers many options for transportation, including subway, light rail, bus service, [[Amtrak]], [[MARC Train]] service through Penn Station and Camden Station as well as access to [[Interstate 83|I-83]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]], [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], 295, and [[Interstate 395 (Maryland)|395]].

'''Executive search''' (informally called '''headhunting''') is a specialized [[recruitment]] service which organizations pay to seek out and recruit highly qualified candidates for senior-level and executive jobs (e.g., President, Vice-president, [[CEO]]). Headhunters may also seek out and recruit other highly specialized and/or skilled positions in [[organization]]s for which there is strong competition in the job market for the top talent, such as senior data analysts or computer programmers. The method usually involves commissioning a third-party organization, typically an executive search firm, but possibly a standalone consultant or [[consulting firm]], to research the availability of suitable qualified candidates working for competitors or related businesses or organizations. Having identified a [[shortlist]] of qualified candidates who match the client's requirements, the executive search firm may act as an intermediary to contact the individual(s) and see if they might be interested in moving to a new employer. The executive search firm may also carry out initial screening of the candidate, negotiations on [[Executive pay|remuneration]] and benefits, and preparing the [[employment contract]].

==Executive search firms==
An executive search firm is a type of professional service firm that specializes in recruiting executives and other senior personnel for their client companies in various industries. [[Senior management|Executive]] search agents/professionals typically have a wide range of personal contacts in their industry or field of specialty; detailed, specific knowledge of the area; and typically operate at the most senior level of executive positions. Executive search professionals are also involved throughout the hiring process, conducting detailed interviews and presenting candidates to clients selectively, when they feel the candidate meets all stated requirements and would fit into the culture of the hiring firm. Executive search firms typically have long-lasting relationships with clients spanning many years, and in such cases the suitability of candidates is paramount. It is also important that such firms operate with a high level of professionalism and confidentiality.

When corporate entities elect to use an outside executive search firm, it is usually because they lack the internal research resources, [[professional network]]s, or evaluative skills to properly recruit for themselves. Using an outside firm also allows the corporate entity the freedom of recruiting from competitors without doing so directly, and the ability to choose among candidates that would not be available through internal or passive sourcing methodologies. Executive search firms are national and international. Many specialize in a particular business industry sector. The contractual relationship between client and executive search firm falls into two broad categories: contingent and retained. Contingent recruiters are paid only upon the successful completion of the "search assignment". Retained recruiters are paid for the process, typically earning a recruiting fee in three stages based on the anticipated compensation of the executive.

In 1959 the [[Association of Executive Search and Leadership Consultants]] (AESC) emerged to set the standards of quality and ethics for the executive search consulting trade. AESC Members range in size from large global firms and networks to boutique firms spanning more than 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aesc.org/ "The Association of Executive Search and Leadership Consultants"], 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retained search===
High-end executive search firms get a retainer (up-front fee) to perform a specific search for a corporate officer or other senior executive position. Typically, retained searches tend to be for positions that pay upwards of [[USD|US$]]150,000 and often far more. Search fees are typically 33.33% of the annual compensation of the recruited executive.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Fee payments may be made in thirds, 1/3 of fee paid on initiation of the search, 1/3 paid thirty days later, and the final 1/3 paid thirty days later or upon placement of the candidate. Alternatively, a fixed fee may be established.  

Retained search firms provide a guarantee to do an assignment over if the hired candidate leaves before a stated milestone (anywhere from one year to three years), generally with the caveat there has not been a material change in the position requirements or management team.{{cn|date=July 2017}} In a retained search, the fee is for the time and expertise of the search firm. The firm is employed to conduct the entire recruitment effort from startup until the candidate has started working.{{cn|date=July 2017}} There are many considerations taken into account when organizations determine whether to hire a retained or other type of search firm, including time and financial resources available, goals of the position search (such as diversity factors), and the importance of discretion and confidentiality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stantonchase.com/7-reasons-why-companies-retain-an-executive-search-firm/|title=7 Reasons for Retained Executive Search {{!}} Stanton Chase|work=Stanton Chase|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Retained recruiters work for the organizations who are their clients, not for job candidates seeking employment, in some countries, such as the UK, recruiters are not legally permitted to charge candidates.  In the U.S. job candidates may pay an up front retainer to a consulting or career counseling firms to assist them in their job search.  Search firms generally commit to "off-limits" agreements.  These agreements prevent a firm from approaching employees of their ''current'' clients as candidates for other clients (for instance, if a headhunter recruits the new [[CEO]] into [[Boeing]], they will agree not to recommend Boeing executives to other companies). Since they act as management consultants working in the best interests of the clients for whom they conduct searches, it would be counterproductive to simultaneously remove talented executives from those client companies. Search firms may decline assignments from certain companies, in order to preserve their ability to recruit candidates from those companies. Some large search firms may insist on guarantees of a certain number or dollar value of searches before they will put an entire company "off-limits".

====Delimited or engaged search====
Another form of high-end executive search, delimited or engaged search, is often improperly categorized as retained search, although there are distinct differences. Similar to retained search firms, delimited/engaged search firms require an up-front fee before engaging the search. Unlike a conventional retainer, however, the delimited/engaged search commitment fee is refundable if the recruiter fails to achieve a hire or other deliverable specified in the contract. Moreover, the delimited/engaged search commitment fee does not follow the typical 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 model of retainers, but rather is a relatively small up-front fee which is discounted from the final placement fee of 25–35% of the successful candidate's first year compensation. Both retained and delimited/engaged searches involve partial payment prior to filling the job, and the contracted recruiter has the search exclusively. Therefore, the search can be customized to the client organization's needs, with the search professional providing a consultative service throughout the process. While both retained and delimited/engaged searches serve client employers rather than job-seeking executives, delimited/engaged search contracts always (as opposed to sometimes) state a future date when the project must be completed or the downpayment refunded.

===Contingent search===
As stated, contingent search firms are remunerated only upon the successful completion of the search—typically when the candidate accepts the position. These recruiters may earn 20% to 35% of the candidate's first-year base salary or total remuneration as a hiring fee; the fee may also be calculated to include the candidate's (that is, the successful hire's) median or expected first-year bonus payout. In any case, the fee is (as always) paid by the hiring company, not the candidate/hire. Contingent firms in some of the emerging markets may quote fees in the range of 12% to 20% as well.

===Pros and cons===
Clients (companies seeking to hire) often tend to work with contingent search firms when filling mid-level positions. As contingent search firms generally rely heavily on their contacts, and seldom work on an exclusive basis, it is not rare for a client to work with a large number of contingent recruiters on the same search at the same time, in order to maximize the volume of candidate (job seeker) resumes they receive. Beyond the increased volume of candidates that such an approach allows, contingent firms do not get paid until the placement is made (a candidate is successfully hired), and thus the search risk is shifted almost entirely to the search firms. Moreover, contingent search firms often work with clients on higher percentage fee basis, relative to retained and delimited search firms as they shoulder more risk. For senior level roles, clients often prefer to work with recruiters who have performed well in the past for them and usually will end up in the hands of a retained or delimited recruiter.  By working exclusively with one firm on such searches, the client generally develops a much deeper relationship with the recruiter, and receives a much higher level of service. With all methods, retained, delimited, and contingency, clients rely on search professionals to provide not just resumes, but also insightful, consultative information about the market in general.

A delimited search is often preferred by clients who are seeking a [[retainer agreement|retainer]]-style service level, while not willing to accept the level of risk that retained search entails. While delimited search does entail up-front fees, they tend to be much smaller than total pre-placement fees that retained search entails. Moreover, delimited search professionals shoulder the risk of their own failure to execute the search within a specified time-frame, offering to refund the up-front fees in such an event. While delimited search is not as desirable for searches that are open-ended in nature, the "ticking clock" is often seen by clients as an incentive that motivates delimited search recruiters to stay more active and involved throughout the hiring process.

The '''Florida SBDC Network''' provides tools, training and resources to small businesses, and has more than 40 offices.

== History ==
The FSBDC was founded in 1976. The FSBDC was started at the University of West Florida as one of the eight original state-based Small Business Development Center pilots funded by the [[Small Business Administration|U.S. Small Business Administration]]. Other participating schools in the program were [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona|California State Polytechnic University at Pomona]], [[California State University at Chico]], [[The University of Georgia]], [[University of Missouri]], [[University of Nebraska at Omaha|the University of Nebraska at Omaha]], [[Rutgers University]] and [[University of Southern Maine|the University of Southern Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asbdc-us.org/About_Us/aboutus_history.html&lt;/ref&gt; The schools were chosen based on their pre-existing efforts to further the business community in their areas.

The goal of these SBDC pilots was to link the state’s higher education system to community outreach, specifically to aid in the development and education of Florida's entrepreneurs and small business community. Today, the FSBDC is one of the 63 SBA funded SBDC programs. These SBDC programs are located in every state and US territory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sba.gov/content/small-business-development-centers-sbdcs&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSBDC began with two centers in its first year of operation. It has since grown to a statewide network of over 35 centers. These centers are partnered with universities, colleges, and other economic organizations. Additionally, they have over 60 outreach locations to provide entrepreneurial services on an as-needed basis in rural and outlying areas.

The FSBDC is state designated as Florida’s Principal Provider of Business Assistance and is the only statewide provider of entrepreneurial services in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;http://uwf.edu/OEDE/FSBDCN.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support and funding==
The Florida SBDC Network is funded in part by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), Defense Logistics Agency, State of Florida and other private and public partners, with the University of West Florida serving as the Network’s designated lead host institution. The Florida SBDC Network is nationally accredited by the Association of SBDCs.

==Services==

The Florida SBDC’s primary services:
* Consulting: one-on-one, confidential business development consulting provided at no cost 
* Training entrepreneurial, business and management development training 
* Informational: access to business information and research

Services include:
* Start-up Assistance
* Business Plan Assistance
* Strategic Plan Assistance
* Market/Sales Growth Assistance (including International Trade, Government Contracting, Business Continuation, and Growth Acceleration)
* Financial and Capital Access Assistance
* Cash Flow Management Assistance 

==Small business classifications==

Florida SBDCs serve the needs of organizations that meet the definition of a small business. The FSBDCN separates small businesses into four markets: pre-venture individuals, start-up businesses, micro businesses, and small and medium-sized enterprises.

# 	Pre-Venture Individuals are defined as individuals exploring the possibility of starting new business. They have no employees, no sales, and have not secured financing.
# 	Start-up businesses are defined as individuals in business for less than three years. They are defined by the amount of time they have been in business and not by their employment of revenues. They are generally in the phase of development with prospect for growth.
# 	Micro businesses are defined as businesses operating for three or more years with fewer than five full-time employees. They are beyond the phases of development with promise for growth in employment and revenue.
# 	Small and medium size enterprises have been in business for three or more years with 5 or more full-time employees.

==Accreditation==
The FSBDC has been designated by the state of Florida as the principal provider of business assistance in the state.&lt;ref name=Senate&gt;{{cite web|last=Senate|first=Florida|title=2011 Florida Statutes|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2011/0288.001|accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSBDC is accredited by the National Association of Small Business Development Centers, based on the Malcolm Balrige Performance Quality Standards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asbdc-us.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the FSBDC requires all businesses consultants to undergo training to be certified as a business analyst for the organization. Consultants are chosen based on their education and business experience. These Certified Business Analysts (CBAs) are also required to attend training sessions to renew their certification every three years.

==Impact and reach==
In 2015, the initiatives of the Florida SBDC Network resulted in 32,398 jobs created, retained and saved; $4.8 billion in sales growth; $276.8 million in capital accessed; $301 million in government contract awards; and 404 new businesses started.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

A recent independent survey, the Economic Impact of the SBDC Business Development Activities on the Florida Economy, the Florida SBDC Network returns $41.07 to the state economy for every $1 invested.&lt;ref&gt;http://floridasbdc.org/Docs/2013/IMPLAN-2012.pdf/&lt;/ref&gt; In the past year, the Network was able to help create, retain, or save 43,856 at an average cost of $118.51, a number well below comparable economic organizations.

==State office==
The State Office was established in Pensacola after one of the eight original SBDC pilots were started at the University of West Florida (UWF). UWF is the lead host institution in the Florida SBDC Network. While each SBDC must report to its host institution, all centers must report to the State Office in Pensacola. 
The State Office is responsible for all programmatic activities and financial reporting to partners. The State Office works directly with all funding partners to ensure each of the offices in Florida are properly allocating the funding given to them.

UWF has primary responsibility for administering the Florida SBDC Network Program and providing leadership, administrative services, and coordination with the SBA through the Cooperative Agreement.

According to PC Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;CIO Definition from PC Magazine Encyclopedia, https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=CIO&amp;i=39685,00.asp, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chief Information Officer]], or [[Chief information officer|CIO]], is defined as the [[executive officer]] in charge of information processing in an organization. All systems design, development and [[datacenter]] operations fall under CIO jurisdiction. CIOs have demanding jobs as [[information systems]] in an organization are often taken for granted until something breaks down. The CIO is responsible for explaining to executive management the complex nightmare this industry has gotten itself into over the past 40 years and why equipment must be constantly retrofitted or replaced. Justifying new expenditures can be a difficult part of the job.

Increasingly, CIOs are involved in creating business and [[e-business]] opportunities through information technology. Collaborating with other executives, CIOs are often working at the core of business development within the organization.

'''Fractional CIO's''' differ from traditional CIO's in that they serve as a working member of a company's executive management team as a contractor and may-or-may-not serve on the company's [[board of directors]]. 

A Fractional CIO, also known as a Part-Time CIO, Parachute CIO, or CIO on-demand is an experienced, multi-faceted professional who serves as the part-time chief information officer of a small or medium-sized business that otherwise could not afford or would not need a full-time executive to hold the position of chief information officer. A [[Virtual CIO]] or vCIO may have a similar role but the term virtual suggests that the individual is not present in the organisation on the same basis as an employed executive. An Interim CIO is generally retained for a limited time period, often to oversee a specific project or to cover an interregnum.  As with traditional CIO's, a Fractional CIO often helps with Technology Roadmaps, Business Process Improvements, and Business Technology Strategy. 

The key business benefit of retaining a Fractional CIO is that they provide the same expertise and capability of a full-time CIO without the associated level of overhead and benefits associated with adding another top level executive. Care, however, must be taken to ensure the skills of the fractional CIO align primarily with the needs of the business, and not weighted with technical expertise in order to achieve the best results.

Fractional CIOs typically serve several companies and may-or-may-not engage in the day-to-day management of a company's [[Information technology|IT]] staff or other resources.

Founded in 1966 by French entrepreneurs, the '''Franco-Thai Chamber of Commerce (FTCC)''' is today one of the most dynamic European chambers in Thailand with over 315 members, with business interests in France and Thailand, and more than 60 events organized every year.

The FTCC is a non-profit organization affiliated to CCI France International, a strong network of 113 French bilateral Chambers in 83 Countries with 900 permanent staff and 27 000 members.

The FTCC offers a wide network, allowing entrepreneurs and companies to successfully approach the market and build longlasting trade relationships for efficient and fruitful business development. The Chamber is also working in collaboration with other trade-related French institutions such as the French Embassy, Economic and Commercial Department or the Foreign Trade Advisors (“''CCE''”).

The FTCC fourfold mission is:
* Serve its Member’s needs
* Promote bilateral trade between France and Thailand
* Help French companies &amp; entrepreneurs expand in Thailand
* Assist companies in their recruitment of French national

== Business Club ==

=== Events ===
With more than 50 events organized per year, the FTCC creates opportunities for companies to extend their professional network and to keep updated on the latest developments regarding the economy, legal issues, HR topics etc.

FTCC events are as varied as possible in order to address the needs of its different categories of Members. They range from monthly networking cocktails, Young Professional social evenings, seminars, committee workshops, special events (its prestigious Gala Dinner, "''Bonjour French Fair''", "''Bonjour Talents''": Brand&amp;Career Fair, etc.) to Business matchings ("''Forum Travailler Ensemble''") and Business delegations to neighboring countries.

=== Advocacy ===
The FTCC is active in defending the interests of its Members through its working Committees (Franco-Thai Relations, Human Resources, Legal Affairs, Luxury and Lifestyle, etc.). These allow Members from one sector to discuss issues of common interest. Position papers might be raised by the FTCC via a specific decision procedure or channeled to the European or International Investors' level in Thailand respectively through the EABC (European Association for Business and Commerce), the JFCCT (Joint Foreign Chambers of Commerce in Thailand) or the BOT (Board of Trade) of which the FTCC is an active member. These institutions are well connected to the Thai authorities policy makers and key stakeholders.

For instance, the JFCCT represents 28 Thai-Foreign Chambers gathering 8,000 companies and the EABC represents 16 European trade organizations and currently features 9 working groups. To double this action, the FTCC's Franco-Thai relations committees regularly organizes high level meetings with Thai and French Officials (Board of Investment, Ministers, etc.) to voice the position of its Members.

== Business Support ==

=== Business Support to French companies (FR) ===
FTCC's Business Support department, in coordination with its wide network of partners in Thailand and in France, provides assistance to French companies in every step of their commercial development in Thailand:
* Market information and practical business advice (e.g. setting up a company in Thailand)
* Advice on imports &amp; exports: updated lists of French and Thai importers and exporters, Customs regulations, etc.
* Potential partners targeting (sales or sourcing) for prospecting French companies
* Trade missions (individual or collective) / business appointments arrangement
* Product/offer testing, commercial representation, participation to local [[trade fair]]s, adaptation of [[communication]] material to local context
* [[Domiciliation]] services (P.O. box and mail service, office space, …)
* Business Center (work station, conference room, language interpretation/ translation …)

=== HR Support ===
The FTCC in conjunction with the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, offers a HR Support service. The FTCC assists French nationals in their job search through specific workshops, promotes French trainees for internships in Thailand, provides information on the local labor market and promotes job vacancies on the FTCC website. FTCC also provides HR related information, organizes workshops, and animates a dynamic HR Club for professionals wishing to debate on HR issues.

=== Business Support to Thai companies (TH) ===
The FTCC Business Support (TH) department aims at helping Thai companies to develop business with France, in collaboration with French partners. This includes providing information (standards, regulations, distribution channels) to Thai companies aiming at developing exports or setting up company in France. The FTCC also provides assistance in organizing individual or collective trade mission, arranging programs of meetings in France, and organizing business study tours.

=== EU-funded Project ===
After the success of SCRIPT, the EU-funded project to certify Thai organic silk and Thai natural spa products and services, the FTCC has engaged in the new project called "''Policy Dialogues Support Facility (PDSF)''" to further advance Thailand's cooperation with the EU towards achievement of sustainable economic and social development goals and global integration.

The PDSF, started on 15 August 2013, will end on 15 February 2017. It is implemented by a consortium composed of GOPA Consultants, Development Solutions, Sustainable Development Association and the Franco-Thai Chamber of Commerce. The program of €3.75 million (THB 150 million) will provide support for activities of mutual benefit to Thailand and the European Union in areas such as trade and investment, higher education and science and technology, environment, climate change and good governance.

=== Promosalons ===
Since 1990, the FTCC, as a partner among the 56 offices of Promosalons around the world, has continuously assisted Thai exhibitors and visitors to attend French trade fairs. It promotes more than 10 fairs every year, in France and in Asia, covering various sectors ranging from food, fashion, home decoration, to heavy industries like composite material and environment. Promosalons has provided its services to an ever-growing number of 2,000 Thai visitors and exhibitors per year.

'''George Washington Parke Custis''' (April 30, 1781&amp;nbsp;– October 10, 1857) was a Virginia [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] owner, [[antiquarian]], author, and playwright. The grandson of [[Martha Washington]] and step-grandson and adopted son of [[George Washington]], he and his sister [[Eleanor Parke Custis Lewis|Eleanor]] grew up at [[Mount Vernon]] and in the Washington presidential households. 

Upon reaching age 21, Custis inherited a large fortune from his late father, [[John Parke Custis]], including a plantation in what is now [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]]. High atop a hill overlooking the [[Potomac River]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], he built the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] mansion [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] (1803-18), as a shrine to George Washington. There he preserved and displayed many of Washington's belongings. Custis wrote historical plays about Virginia, delivered a number of patriotic addresses, and was the author of the posthumously-published ''Recollections and Private Memoirs of George Washington'' (1860).

His daughter, [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna Randolph Custis]], married [[Robert E. Lee]]. They inherited Arlington House and the plantation surrounding it, but the property was confiscated by the federal government during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Arlington House is now a museum, interpreted by the [[National Park Service]] as the Robert E. Lee Memorial. The remainder of Arlington plantation is now [[Fort Myer]] and [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

Custis was born on April 30, 1781, at his mother's family home, Mount Airy, which survives in [[Rosaryville State Park]] in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Mt.

Custis's grandmother, Martha Dandridge Custis Washington, had been widowed in 1757, and married [[George Washington]] in January 1759. His father had grown up at [[Mount Vernon]].

The Washingtons brought Custis and Nelly, 8 and 10 years old, respectively, to [[New York City]] in 1789, to live in the [[Samuel Osgood House|first]] and [[Alexander Macomb House|second presidential mansions]]. Following the transfer of the national capital to [[Philadelphia]], the original "[[First Family]]" occupied the [[President's House (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|President's House]] from 1790 to 1797.

Custis (nicknamed "Wash") attended—but did not graduate from—[[Germantown Academy]] in [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]] (now in [[Philadelphia]]), [[Pennsylvania]]; the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]); and [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. George Washington repeatedly expressed frustration with young Custis, as well as his own inability to improve the youth's attitude. Upon young Custis's return to Mount Vernon after only one term at St. John's, George Washington sent him to his mother and stepfather (Dr. David Stuart) at [[Hope Park]], writing "He appears to me to be moped and Stupid, says nothing, and is always in some hole or corner excluded from the Company."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Washington|first=George|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x4GyAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA412#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=To David Stuart|work=The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources 1745-1799: Volume 36: August 4, 1797-October 28, 1798: Prepared under the direction of the United States George Washington Bicentennial Commission and published by authority of Congress,1939-01-01|editor=John C.

In January 1799, Custis was commissioned as a [[Cornet (military rank)|cornet]] in the [[United States Army]] and was promoted to second lieutenant in March. He served as ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to [[General officer|General]] [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] and was honorably discharged on June 15, 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/gwpcusti.htm|title=George Washington Parke Custis, Colonel, United States Army|first=Michael Robert|last=Patterson|website=www.arlingtoncemetery.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building Arlington House==
When  Custis came of age, he inherited large amounts of money, land, and property from the estates of his father, John Parke Custis, and grandfather [[Daniel Parke Custis]]. Upon Martha Washington's death in 1802, he received a bequest from her (as he had upon George Washington's death in 1799) as well as his father's former plantations because of the termination of Martha's life estate.&lt;ref&gt;These included about 80 slaves from the John Parke Custis estate; 35 dower slaves at [[Mount Vernon]] from the [[Daniel Parke Custis#Custis Estate|Daniel Parke Custis estate]]; Elisha, the one slave Martha Washington owned outright; and about 40 more slaves from the John Parke Custis estate following his mother's 1811 death. See: Henry Weincek, ''An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America'' (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2003), p. 383n.

Custis thereupon moved into a four-room, 80-year-old house on land inherited from his father, who had called it "Mount Washington".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160307213745/http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/10738/WillRudyDRUM.pdf%3Bjsessionid%3D2517F43DCE70CA7F968146B0C1670EC3?sequence=1 Rudy], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately, Custis began constructing Arlington House on his land, which at the time was within Alexandria County (now Arlington County) in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. Hiring [[George Hadfield (architect)|George Hadfield]] as architect, he constructed a mansion that was the first example of [[Greek Revival architecture]] in America.&lt;ref name=registration&gt;{{cite web|first=Adam|last=Smith|first2=Megan|last2=Tooker|last3=Enscore|first3=Susan (U.S. Corps of Engineers)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904235704/http://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/14000146.pdf|archivedate=2014-09-04|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/14000146.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form:  Arlington National Cemetery Historic District|date=2013-01-31|publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior]]: [[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He located the building on a prominent hill overlooking the Georgetown-Alexandria Turnpike (at the approximate location of the present Eisenhower Drive in Arlington National Cemetery), the [[Potomac River]], and the growing Washington City on the opposite side of the river.&lt;ref name=registration/&gt;

Using slave labor and materials on site, and interrupted by the [[War of 1812]] (and material shortages after the British burned the American capital city), Custis finally completed the mansion's exterior in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160307213745/http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/10738/WillRudyDRUM.pdf%3Bjsessionid%3D2517F43DCE70CA7F968146B0C1670EC3?sequence=1 Rudy], pp. 16-18, 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Custis intended the mansion to serve as a living memorial to George Washington, and included design elements similar to Mt.

Vernon, although the interior was not completed (and renovated) until occupancy by Robert E. Lee's family (including Custis's grandsons/heirs) in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160307213745/http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/10738/WillRudyDRUM.pdf%3Bjsessionid%3D2517F43DCE70CA7F968146B0C1670EC3?sequence=1 Rudy], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/arho/historyculture/george-custis.htm|title=George Washington Parke Custis - Arlington House, The Robert  E.

==Later life==
In 1802, the [[Washington Jockey Club]] sought a site for a new race course, as its old site—which occupied land from the rear of what is now the site of Decatur House at H Street and Jackson Place, across Seventeenth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, to Twentieth Street, where the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]] sits today—was suffering encroachment from the growth of the Federal City. Under the leadership of [[John Tayloe III]] and [[Charles Carnan Ridgely]], and with the support of Custis, Gen. [[John Peter Van Ness]], Dr. [[William Thornton]], John D. Threlkeld of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] and [[George Calvert (planter)|George Calvert]] of [[Riversdale (Riverdale Park, Maryland)|Riversdale]], Bladensburg, Maryland, the races were moved to Holmstead Farm's one-mile oval track on Meridian Hill, south of Columbia Road, between Fourteenth and Sixteenth streets.{{citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=was a section challenged in July 2017 for being unsourced}}

On July 7, 1804, Custis married [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary Lee Fitzhugh]]. Of their four children, only one daughter, [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna Randolph Custis]], survived to maturity. She married [[Robert E. Lee]] at Arlington House on June 30, 1831. Lee's father, [[Henry Lee III|Henry Lee III (Light-Horse Harry Lee)]] had delivered the [[eulogy]] at George Washington's December 18, 1799, funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/project/exhibit/mourning/response.html |title=Papers of George Washington |publisher=Gwpapers.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228192657/http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/project/exhibit/mourning/response.html |archivedate=2012-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the War of 1812, Custis assisted in the firing of an [[artillery]] piece to help defend Washington, D.C., from the British during the [[Battle of Bladensburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=McCavitt|first2=Christopher| last2=George|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPOZCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Battle of Bladensburg, August 24,1814|work=The man who captured Washington: Major General Robert Ross and the War of 1812|year=2016|page=137|location=[[Norman, Oklahoma]]|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|isbn=9780806151649|oclc=911518963|quote=A Mr. Custis of Arlington, a relative of George Washington, assisted in loading the last round, despite being disabled in one hand by rheumatism.}} At [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; He also delivered and published an address condemning the death of Revolutionary War general [[James Lingan]] who was killed by a Baltimore mob for defending an anti-war publisher's right to oppose the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/metsnav/common/navigate.do?oid=VAC2386&amp;pn=4&amp;size=screen Oration by Mr. Custis, of Arlington; with an Account of the Funeral Solemnities in Honor of the Lamented Gen.

In 1815, Custis was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistc|title=MemberListC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1820s, Custis was an active member of the [[American Colonization Society]]—an organization that supported the colonization of free blacks in Africa, particularly in [[Liberia]]. Custis eventually lost interest in the Society, but his wife and daughter continued to support it for many years. Colonization was generally unpopular with [[African Americans|African American]] slaves. Of the Arlington slaves, only William Burke and his family chose to move to Liberia. In 1854, William and Rosabella Burke and their children left Arlington House for [[Monrovia|Monrovia, Liberia]]. Rosabella continued to write to Mrs. Lee and named a new daughter "Martha" in tribute to the family.&lt;ref name=women&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtonhouse.org/about/the-stories/women-of-arlington |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6d5tUN8ko?url=http://www.arlingtonhouse.org/about/the-stories/women-of-arlington |archivedate=2015-11-17 |title=The Women of Arlington |publisher=Save Historic Arlington House, Inc. |website=arlingtonhouse.org |year=2012 |accessdate=2015-11-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One biographer claimed [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] and his son [[Georges Washington de La Fayette]] visited Custis at [[Mount Vernon]] in 1825, although Custis was then living at Arlington House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Lafayette in America| pages=197–9| author=Auguste Levasseur | others=Translator Alan Hoffman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, the federal government [[District of Columbia retrocession|retroceded]] to the state of Virginia the portion of the District of Columbia that was south and west of the Potomac River, which at the time contained the city and county of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]].  Custis initially opposed the retrocession, but later spoke in support of it. Alexandrians then elected Custis to represent the area in the [[Virginia General Assembly]] when the legislature considered the retrocession. The General Assembly approved the retrocession on March 13, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mark David|last=Richards|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219203534/http://www.dcvote.org/sites/default/files/documents/articles/mdrretrocession.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-19|url=http://www.dcvote.org/sites/default/files/documents/articles/mdrretrocession.pdf|title=The Debates over the Retrocession of the District of Columbia, 1801–2004|work=Washington History: Magazine of the [[Historical Society of Washington, D.C.]]|number=1, Spring/Summer 2004|volume=16|pages=67–68|location=Washington, D.C.|issn=1042-9719|oclc=429216416|accessdate=2016-09-03}} At  [https://www.dcvote.org DC Vote].&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On July 4, 1848, Custis attended the ceremony celebrating the laying of the [[cornerstone]] of the [[Washington Monument]] by [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]]. Along with President [[James K. Polk]], the ceremony attracted 20,000 other spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crutchfield|first=James A.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VxP8vG5I2NkC&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=218|title=George Washington: First in War, First in Peace|year=2005|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=A Forge Book: Tom Doherty Associates, LLC|isbn=0765310708|oclc=269434694}} At [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 4, 1850, Custis dedicated a stone that the people of the District of Columbia had donated to the Monument at a ceremony that President [[Zachary Taylor]] attended, five days before Taylor died from food poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=John|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H4ig_dTZbzkC&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Lee: A Life of Virtue|publisher=Thomas Nelson|location=[[Nashville, Tennessee]]|year=2010|pages=93–94|isbn=1595550283|oclc=456177249}} At [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853, the writer [[Benson John Lossing]] visited Custis at Arlington House.&lt;ref&gt;See the Cornell University Library transcription of ''Harper's New Monthly Magazine'' article:
[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/moa-cgi?notisid=ABK4014-0007-69] (starting on page 433). Four of the Custis paintings mentioned in the ''Harper'''s article(Battle of Germantown/Battle of Trenton/Battle of Princeton/Washington at Yorktown) were republished in
[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage magazine]] in February 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

Custis achieved some distinction as an orator and playwright. In addition to the Lingan eulogy, he delivered ''The Celebration of the Russian Victories, in Georgetown, District of Columbia; on the 5th of June, 1813'' (1813). Two of Custis's plays, ''The Indian Prophecy; or Visions of Glory'' (1827) and ''Pocahontas; or, The Settlers of Virginia'' (1830), were published during his lifetime. Other plays included ''The Rail Road'' (1828), ''The Eighth of January, or, Hurra for the Boys of the West!'' (ca. 1830), ''North Point, or, Baltimore Defended'' (1833), and ''Montgomerie, or, The Orphan of a Wreck'' (1836). Custis wrote a series of biographical essays about his adoptive father that were compiled and posthumously published in 1859 and 1860, after his own death in 1857, as ''Recollections and Private Memoirs of Washington''.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite book|last=Custis|first=G.W.

Custis was descended from a number of aristocratic [[Colonial America|colonial era]] families, as well as, through his mother [[Eleanor Calvert|Eleanor Calvert Custis Stuart]], British [[nobility]] and, very distantly, from the royal houses of [[House of Hanover|Hanover]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart]]. His mother was descended from [[Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore]], and [[Henry Lee of Ditchley]], one of whose descendants was [[Edward Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield]], who married [[Charlotte Lee, Countess of Lichfield|Charlotte Fitzroy]], an illegitimate daughter of Charles II by one of his mistresses, [[Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland|Barbara Palmer]]. It is believed Custis was descended from George I's natural daughter [[Melusina von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham]], whose extra-marital liaison with [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore]], produced a son, [[Benedict Swingate Calvert]], who was Custis's maternal grandfather. Custis's father, [[John Parke Custis]], was the son of Martha Washington by her marriage to [[Daniel Parke Custis]].

Custis's sister Eleanor "Nelly" Parke Custis Lewis married George Washington's nephew, [[Lawrence Lewis (1767–1839)|Lawrence Lewis]]. As a wedding present, Washington gave Nelly a section of Mount Vernon's land, on which the Lewises established [[Woodlawn (plantation)|Woodlawn plantation]] and constructed Woodlawn Mansion.&lt;ref name=Woodlawn&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Historic Landmark Nomination Form: Woodlawn |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118224026/http://focus.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NHLS/Text/70000792.pdf|archivedate=2015-11-18|url=http://focus.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NHLS/Text/70000792.pdf|format=pdf|date=March 4, 1998 |first=Craig|last=Tuminaro|first2=Carolyn|last2=Pitts |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Park Service]] has listed Woodlawn on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=Woodlawn/&gt;

Another sister of Custis, Martha Parke Custis Peter, married Thomas Peter. Using Martha's inheritances from George and Martha Washington, the Peters purchased property in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] within the District of Columbia. The couple then constructed the [[Tudor Place]] mansion on the property. Tudor Place and its grounds, which the National Park Service has listed on the National Register of Historic Places, contain features that resemble those of Arlington House and Woodlawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morton|first=W.

In 1826, Custis admitted the paternity of Maria Carter, who had been born in 1803 to Arianna "Airy" Carter (1776-1880), an African-American slave maid at the Arlington estate who had earlier resided at Mount Vernon as a slave of Martha Washington. Maria lived and worked at Arlington as a slave until 1826, when she married Charles Syphax, a slave who oversaw the dining room of Arlington House. Soon after Maria's marriage, Custis freed her and gave her a {{convert|17|acre|hectare|0|adj=on}} plot in the southwest corner of the Arlington estate. Maria subsequently raised ten children on her property. Tall trees and stretches of grassland reportedly surrounded Maria's white cottage.&lt;ref name=women/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/arho/exb/Slavery/medium/ARHO-6408-Image-of-Maria-Sy.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116223551/http://www.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/arho/exb/Slavery/medium/ARHO-6408-Image-of-Maria-Sy.html|archivedate=2015-11-16|title=Maria Carter Syphax|work=Museum Management Program|publisher=Arlington House: The Robert E.

Custis died in 1857 and was buried at Arlington alongside his wife, [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis]], who had died four years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/gwpcusti.htm |title=George Washington Parke Custis |publisher=Michael Robert Patterson|date= |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Custis's will&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nathanielturner.com/willofgeorgewashingtonparkecustis.htm |title=Will of George Washington Parke Custis |publisher=Nathanielturner.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided that: 
* Arlington plantation (approx. 1100 acres) and its contents, including Custis's collection of George Washington's artifacts and memorabilia, would be bequeathed to his only surviving child, [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna Randolph Custis]] (the wife of Robert E. Lee) for her natural life, and upon her death, to his eldest grandson George Washington Custis Lee;
* [[White House (plantation)|White House plantation]], in [[New Kent County]], and [[Romancoke, Virginia|Romancoke plantation]], in [[King William County]], (approx. 4000 acres each) would be bequeathed to his other two grandsons, [[William Henry Fitzhugh Lee]] ("Rooney Lee") and [[Robert Edward Lee, Jr.]], respectively;
* Cash gifts of $10,000 each would be provided to his four granddaughters, based on the incomes from the plantations and the sales of other smaller properties (some properties could not be sold until after the Civil War and it is doubtful that $10,000 each was ever fully paid);
* Certain property in "square No. 21, Washington City" (possibly located between present-day [[Foggy Bottom]] and the Potomac River)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history-map.com/picture/005/pictures/Washington-Map-Old-001.jpg |title=Map of Washington|website=history-map.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be bequeathed to Robert E. Lee "and his heirs";
* Custis's slaves, numbered around 200, were to be freed once the legacies and debts from his estate were paid, but no later than five years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Fulfilled by Robert E. Lee, executor, in the winter of 1862. see http://files.usgwarchives.net/va/spotsylvania/wills/c2320001.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

Custis' death impacted the careers of Robert E. Lee and his two elder sons on the cusp of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Douglas Southall|last=Freeman|title=Robert E. Lee: a Biography|volume=vol. 1|chapter=Chapter 22|year=1934|publisher=Scribner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee, named as the will's executor, took a two-year leave from his army post in Texas to settle the estate. During this period Lee was ordered to lead troops to quash [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]]. By 1859, Lee's eldest son, George Washington Custis Lee, got transferred to an army position in Washington, D.C., so that he could care for Arlington plantation, where his mother and sisters were living. Lee's second son, Rooney Lee, resigned his army commission, got married, and took over farming [[White House (plantation)|White House]] and [[Romancoke, Virginia|Romancoke]] plantations near Richmond. Robert E. Lee was able to leave for Texas to resume his army career in February 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|title=Robert E. Lee|volume=vol. 1|chapter=Chapter 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of the  American Civil War, [[Union Army]] forces seized the {{convert|1100|acre|km2|adj=on}} Arlington Plantation for strategic reasons (protection of the river and national capital).&lt;ref name=ANC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Explore/History/Arlington-House|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117100524/http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Explore/History/Arlington-House|archivedate=2016-01-17|date=2015-10-07|title=Arlington House, The Robert E.

In 1864, [[Montgomery C.

It is restored and open to the public under the auspices of the [[National Park Service]], while the [[U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] controls Fort Myer and [[Arlington National Cemetery]] on the remainder of the Arlington Plantation.

[[File:SA 7262-Gerrit Pietersz. Bicker (1554-1604).jpg|{{largethumb}}|Gerrit Bicker by an anonymous Amsterdam artist, 1583.]]
'''Gerrit Pieter Bicker''' (1554–1604) was a Dutch merchant and one of the founders of the [[Compagnie van Verre]] and its successor the [[Dutch East India Company]].

==Family==
Born in [[Amsterdam]], he was the son of the brewer [[Pieter Bicker]] and his wife Lijsbeth Banninck and belonged to the powerful Bicker family of ''[[regenten]]''. In 1580 Gerrit married Aleyd Andriesdr Boelens (descended from the knight [[Andries Boelens]]), making him brother in law to [[Claes Boelens]], [[mayor of Amsterdam]]—they had five children: [[Jan Bicker|Jan]], [[Andries Bicker|Andries]], [[Cornelis Bicker|Cornelis]] and  [[Jacob Bicker (heer van Engelenburg)|Jacob Bicker]].

==Life==
In 1585 Bicker was one of the richest merchants in Amsterdam, initially living on the [[Oudezijds Achterburgwal]] and later on the Niezel. In 1590 he was elected to the town council and six years later he not only became one of the founding directors of the Compagnie van Verre but also invested in [[Uilenburg (Amsterdam)|Uilenburg]], whilst also involved in the sale of plots of land. In 1597 he and his brother Laurens established the Compagnie van Guinee to trade with [[Guinea]] and on the [[Río de la Plata]] in South America. In 1601 Gerard le Roy and Laurens Bicker led the twelfth Dutch expedtition to the east Indies, paid for by the Vereenigde Zeeuwse Compagnie (United Zeeland Company), a 'voorcompagnie'.

In 1600 Gerrit sold his father's brewery. In 1602 he became one of the first financial backers of the Dutch East India Company, contributing 21,000 gulden. He was also one of the first Dutch traders to trade with the [[White Sea]]. In 1603 he became mayor of Amsterdam. His son laid the foundation stone of the [[Zuiderkerk (Amsterdam)|Zuiderkerk]]. In 1604 Gerrit was 'ambachtsheer' of [[Amstelveen]], [[Nieuwer-Amstel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}}

[[Image:Global Unions.png|right]]
'''Global Unions''' or '''Council of Global Unions''' is a [[website]], which is jointly owned and managed by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC), the [[Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD|Trade Union Advisory Committee]] to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], and ten [[global union federation]]s (GUFs).

The Council of Global Unions (CGU) held its inaugural meeting in Brussels, 9–10 January 2007. All GUFs, with the exception of the International Metalworkers' Federation, as well as TUAC, became members of the Council and signed the agreement.

The CGU was created to encourage closer co-operation among global unions in order to act more effectively at the international level to build a more favourable, enabling environment for organising and collective bargaining. Although its work has policy implications, it was not established to make policy. That is the responsibility of the organisations that constitute the CGU.

The Global Unions group is made up of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), which has 175 million members in 151 countries; the global union federations, which represent their respective sectors at the international trade union level (BWI, EI, IAEA, ICEM, IFJ, IMF, ITF, ITGLWF, IUF, PSI and UNI); and the Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC) to the OECD.

In November 2006 two international union organizations were created, the ITUC and the Council of Global Unions that emerged from a reorganization of the international trade union movement (which was divided because of post-war divisions). ITUC is the result of the breakup of both the WCL and ICFTU for the purposes of uniting under one organisation. The Council of Global Unions was created at the first meeting of ITUC and is a body involving the GUFs, ITUC, and TUAC.

Although Global Unions are described as 'global', this represents more an "aspiration than a reality since they are more accurately described as international bodies with wide coverage that are 'globalising{{'"}} (Croucher and Cotton, 2009). Historically, they have built outwards from their European bases in an attempt to include unions in other regions and are still trying to extend their coverage to every country where unions are found.

According to Harold Lewis (2003) the Global Union Federations are responsible for 80 per cent of the international movement’s activity and 90 per cent of its work directly affecting workplaces.

'''Grzegorz Andrzej Ślak''' (born 16 May 1965 in [[:pl:Ostrzeszów|Ostrzeszów]]) - Polish entrepreneur, lawyer (specializing in excise duties), financier.

== Career ==
Ślak started his career at [[:pl:Bank BPH|Bank Przemysłowo-Handlowy]] in [[Rybnik]], where he was involved mainly in financing and restructuring energy, steel and mining-related companies.

In 2002 he became the President of the Management Board of [[:pl:Rafineria Trzebinia|Rafineria Trzebinia]].

As the first person in Poland, he has "built" a facility for producing higher fatty acid methyl esters ('biofuels') and pharmaceutical glycerine, thus becoming "the pioneer of Polish biofuels".{{Fact|date=August 2016}}

In 2005, he "built" the first plant for hydrorefining of purified paraffin in Central and Eastern Europe under license by Exxon Mobil. The plant allowed for use of petroleum processing products (paraffin) in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W Rafinerii Trzebinia pierwsza w Europie Środkowej instalacja hydrorafinacji parafin|url=http://www.pb.pl/1403402,89690,w-rafinerii-trzebinia-pierwsza-w-europie-srodkowej-instalacja-hydrorafinacji-parafin|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he developed a new technology and started to produce a new fuel, trade name "ON BIO 10", consisting of diesel oil and 20% addition of higher fatty acid methyl esters. On this basis, the Minister of Economy adopted the quality standard for this fuel which is still in effect. For this product, Rafineria Trzebinia was awarded the Promotional Emblem “Teraz Polska” in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rafineria Trzebinia zaczęła sprzedawać ON BIO - prasa|url=http://www.pb.pl/1403029,19980,rafineria-trzebinia-zaczela-sprzedawac-on-bio-prasa|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ORLEN Południe|url=http://www.rafineria-trzebinia.pl/PL/OFirmie/Strony/Historia-Firmy.aspx|agency=www.rafineria-trzebinia.pl|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiesel w sprzedaży|url=http://www.dziennikpolski24.pl/artykul/1559892,biodiesel-w-sprzedazy,id,t.html?cookie=1|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, Ślak was accused of reducing the payable excise duties for the unprecedented amount of PLN 760 million in connection with his duties as the President of the Management Board of Rafineria Trzebinia. After two years, tax authorities confirmed accuracy of the settlements, thus accepting correctness of the tax rate applied by Ślak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Życie z prokuratorem na karku|url=http://www.newsweek.pl/grzegorz-slak-zaklada-fundacje-pomagajaca-ofiarom-prokuratury,artykuly,362347,1,z.html|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he became the President of the Management Board of Skotan S.A., leading the company to one of its biggest stock increases on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skotan: nowy prezes zadba o biopaliwa|url=http://www.wnp.pl/wiadomosci/skotan-nowy-prezes-zadba-o-biopaliwa,11642.html|agency=wnp.pl|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he became the President of the Management Board of Bioeton S.A. In this company, he carried out a capital investment which allowed for the takeover of BDK Kyritz GmbH, a German renewable energy company. In 2009, he became the President of the Management Board of BDK Kyritz GmbH in Germany. Ślak restructured the company, which involved restoring its financial liquidity. At that time, the company was in the state of so-called "temporary bankruptcy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grzegorz Ślak pokieruje niemieckim producentem biopaliw|url=http://nafta.wnp.pl/grzegorz-slak-pokieruje-niemieckim-producentem-biopaliw,85746_1_0_0.html|agency=wnp.pl|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 he took up the position of the President of the Management Board of Wratislavia Biodiesel S.A.,  a part of Bartimpex S.A capital group, which produces methyl esters and higher fatty acids (biodiesel), as well as raw and pharmaceutical glycerine. At the time of Ślak's taking up of the position, the company had not been operating due to a lack of contracts. As a result of his restructuring, Wratislavia Biodiesel S.A. generated a 7-digit net profit for the year 2012. At the same time, Ślak carried out an investment in bioethanol dehydrated spirit production plant, thus expanding the company's economic activity. The successful restructuring enabled the company to begin an application process for entering the stock market at the beginning of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mistrz paliw na prostej|url=http://www.forbes.pl/artykuly/sekcje/Strategie/mistrz-paliw-na-prostej,27789,1|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W imię Aleksandra|url=http://www.wprost.pl/ar/392188/W-imi-Aleksandra/|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the President of the Management Board and a shareholder of Wratislavia Biodiesel S.A., he has been carrying out works to build a plant for producing algae fuels (third-generation fuels). If successful, it will be the first plant of this sort in Europe.

Since October 2011, Ślak has been simultaneously holding the post of the President of the Management Board of Akwawit-Polmos S.A. (also a part of Bartimpex S.A capital group) - a producer of spirits and vodkas. At the time of Ślak's taking up of the position, the company had fulfilled all the legal requirements to file for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grzegorz Ślak: Akwawit-Polmos liczy na nowy kontrakt|url=http://www.wnp.pl/wiadomosci/grzegorz-slak-akwawit-polmos-liczy-na-nowy-kontrakt,202217.html|agency=wnp.pl|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, his actions resulted in signing agreements with world-scale alcohol producers: one with Brown-Forman (the owner of Jack Daniels and Finlandia brands) for the production of Maximus vodka and another with Diageo (the owner of Johnnie Walker and Baileys) for the production of Smirnoff vodka. As a result of the financial restructuring, the company is planning to enter the stock market in 2016.

As part of the restructuring process, Ślak carried out an investment in Poland's most modern alcohol production line licensed by CFT Packaging S.A. The line is able to produce 100 million bottles a year, which increases the overall productivity of Akwawit-Polmos S.A. to 150 million bottles a year, thus placing the company among the biggest alcohol producers in Central-Eastern Europe.

In 2013, he replaced the deceased [[Aleksander Gudzowaty]] as the President of the Management Board of Bartimpex S.A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grzegorz Ślak nowym prezesem spółki Bartimpex {{!}} Zmiany kadrowe {{!}} pulshr.pl|url=http://www.pulshr.pl/zmiany-kadrowe/grzegorz-slak-nowym-prezesem-spolki-bartimpex,13091.html|agency=www.pulshr.pl|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2003, the Polish government signed an agreement with the U.S. for purchase of 48 F-16 jets for USD 3.5 million. In exchange, the Americans agreed, among others, to invest in Poland's economy and help Polish enterprises to invest in the American market. They failed to fulfill the latter point. In 2014, carrying out the duties of the President of Bartimpex Management Board, Grzegorz Ślak led the company to reach a settlement with Lockheed Martin under which the Polish company was awarded several million dollars in damages. Bartimpex was the only legal entity in Poland to have been awarded damages for the unfulfilled offset agreement conditions.

Grzegorz Ślak initiated the PGNiG takeover of the part of the Yamal–Europe gas pipeline that goes through Poland. The transaction enabled PGNiG to take over 4% of the shares, which gave it advantage over Gazprom (52% to 48%) and guaranteed the Polish party the decisive vote on the most significant matters concerning EuropolGaz, the owner of the pipeline.

'''John Murray Forbes''' (February 23, 1813 &amp;ndash; October 12, 1898) was an American railroad [[magnate]], [[merchant]], philanthropist and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]. He was president of both the [[Michigan Central railroad]] and the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] in the 1850s. He kept doing business with [[Russell &amp; Company]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

==Early life==
Forbes was born on February 23, 1813, in [[Bordeaux]], France.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  His father, Ralph Bennett Forbes, was a member of the [[Forbes family]], descended from Scottish immigrants who attempted unsuccessfully to start a trade from Bordeaux.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; His mother, Margaret Perkins, was a member of the [[Boston Brahmin]] Perkins family merchant dynasty involved in the China trade.  Among his siblings was older brother was [[Robert Bennet Forbes]], [[sea captain]] and [[Old China Trade|China]] [[merchant]].&lt;ref name="Smith1948"&gt;Smith, George Winston. "Broadsides for Freedom: Civil War Propaganda in New England." ''The New England Quarterly'', Vol. 21, No. 3. (Sep., 1948), pp.&amp;nbsp;291–312.&lt;/ref&gt;  

His paternal uncle was [[John Murray Forbes (diplomat)|John Murray Forbes]], lawyer and [[diplomat]], and his maternal uncle was merchant [[Thomas Handasyd Perkins]].  Among his cousins was the botanist [[Francis Blackwell Forbes]].&lt;ref name="Smith1948"/&gt;

In 1814, his parents moved back to the [[Captain Robert Bennet Forbes House]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]].  Forbes attended school at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], then at [[Round Hill School]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], from 1823 to 1828.

==Career==
Forbes was one of three brothers sent by their uncle to [[Guangzhou|Canton, China]], and achieved some financial success during a short time spent trading in Canton. However, unlike his brother [[Robert Bennet Forbes|Robert]], who devoted himself to the China trade, Forbes returned to [[Boston]] and became an early railroad investor and landowner.  

As with [[Jay Gould]] and [[E. H. Harriman]], Forbes was an important figure in the building of America's railroad system. From March 28, 1846 through 1855, he was president of [[Michigan Central Railroad]], and he was a director and president of the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]], he helped with the growth of the American Middle West.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Henry. ''An American Railroad Builder: John Murray Forbes'', Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, he founded [[J.M. Forbes &amp; Co.]], an investment firm in Boston in 1838.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmforbes.com/history/ |title=History of J.M. Forbes &amp; Co. |website=J.M. Forbes &amp; Co. |access-date=October 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, he was an elector for [[Abraham Lincoln]]. He served as the Chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]] during the administration of President [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="interdead"/&gt; Staunchly pro-Union, he is given credit for founding the New England [[Loyal Publication Society]] in early 1863 (Smith 1948). &lt;ref&gt;Historical Note: In 1863, John Murray Forbes, served as a 'confidential agent' of Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Wells, in Paris, France.

Citation: "The Union", A Guide to Federal Archives Relating to the Civil War, 1986, edited by K.W. Munden and H. P. Beers, 452.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Civil War, Forbes was elected as a 3rd Class (honorary) Companion of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]].&lt;ref name="Smith1948"/&gt;

Forbes was a delegate to the Republican conventions of 1876, 1880 and 1884, he eventually became displeased with the Republican party and worked successfully to get Democrat [[Grover Cleveland]] elected President.

===Philanthropy===
He supplied money and weapons to New Englanders to fight slavery in [[Kansas]] and in 1859 entertained [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]].

Forbes's many philanthropic activities included the re-establishment of [[Milton Academy]], a preparatory school south of [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (editor), Sarah Forbes.''Life and Recollections of John Murray Forbes'', Two Volumes, Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
In the September 1899 issue of "''Atlantic''" magazine, [[Edward Waldo Emerson]] (Ralph Waldo Emerson's son), published Forbes' biography. The Emerson and Forbes families were close as Forbes' son, [[William Hathaway Forbes|William]], married Ralph's daughter, Edith Emerson.  In ''Letters and Social Aims'', [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote of Forbes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Never was such force, good meaning, good sense, good action, combined with such domestic lovely behavior, such modesty and persistent preference for others. Wherever he moved he was the benefactor... How little this man suspects, with his sympathy for men and his respect for lettered and scientific people, that he is not likely, in any company, to meet a man superior to himself," and "I think this is a good country that can bear such a creature as he."&lt;ref&gt;{{White - America's most noteworthy railroaders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The small community of [[Forbes, Missouri]], is named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RfAuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=How Missouri Counties, Towns and Streams Were Named | publisher=The State Historical Society of Missouri | author=Eaton, David Wolfe | year=1916 | pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krit Ratanarak''' ({{th-lang|กฤตย์ รัตนรักษ์}}; {{RTGS|''Krit Rattanarak''}}; born 19 April 1946) is the Chairman of [[Bangkok Broadcasting &amp; Television Company]] (operator of Channel 7) and head of one of Thailand’s leading family business groups.  The Ratanarak family have substantial holdings in a number of Thai-based companies including [[Bank of Ayudhya|Krungsri Bank]], Siam City Cement, Allianz Ayudhya, Sri Ayudhya Capital, Matching Studio, Media of Medias and Eastern Star Real Estate as well as holding a majority stake in BBTV.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

==Family==
Krit Ratanarak was born in 1946 and is the eldest of six children with five sisters, four of whom now live outside Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3715/is_199809/ai_n8814582/pg_33/ |title=Global Finance 600: The world's most powerful financial players |publisher=BNET Find Articles |accessdate=2009-11-09 |year=1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026001643/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3715/is_199809/ai_n8814582/pg_33/ |archivedate=26 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Sasithorn, still lives in [[Bangkok]].  

The Ratanarak family are known to be very private; Forbes call them ‘a very secretive clan’&lt;ref name="forbesmag"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Forbes Magazine|date=18 July 1994|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Krit’s son Chachchon has been described as being ‘influential while staying below the radar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Business Report Thailand|date=January 2012|pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ratanaraks are one of the few remaining ‘old money’ families in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Forbes Magazine|date=18 July 1994|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krit is the son of [[Chuan Ratanarak]], who founded Bank of Ayudhya (known today as Krungsri Bank), Siam City Cement (producer of the Insee Cement brand) and Bangkok Broadcasting and Television &lt;ref&gt;Hiscock (1997), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of Thailand’s last great self-made business Titans.&lt;ref name="chuan"&gt;{{cite news|title=BANK OF AYUDHYA CHAIRMAN PASSES AWAY|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=4 August 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Krit took over the family businesses after the death of his father in 1993.

==Career==
Ratanarak is one of the most successful and businessmen in Thailand.&lt;ref name=forbesmag /&gt; He joined [[Bank of Ayudhya]] in 1972 becoming President in 1982 and CEO in 1990. In 1993 he became Chairman and CEO of the bank, Chairman of BBTV, Chairman of Siam City Cement and Chairman of Ayudhya Insurance.&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1990s, Ratanarak navigated [[Bank of Ayudhya]] and the other family businesses through the worst of the Asian financial crisis with the result that the Ratanaraks were one of only 8 business groups that had been in Thailand’s top 40 in 1979 to survive in the top rankings in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after the crisis Ratanarak strengthened the major family businesses by introducing outside capital and international management expertise.&lt;ref name="The Nation"/&gt;

Ratanarak recapitalised Siam City Cement in 1998 in the process selling part of the family’s equity to Holderbank (later to become [[Holcim]]). Contemporary newspaper reports wrongly suggested that the sale of equity to Holderbank was used by the family to raise the funds required to recapitalize Bank of Ayudhya.  However, as part of the terms of the sale, the full proceeds received by the family from Holderbank – as well as additional funds from the Ratanarak Group - were reinvested in Siam City Cement via a rights issue to recapitalize the business and the capital injected by the family into the bank came instead from contingency reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Before Nowadays…40 Years of Siam City Cement PCL.

While other banks closed or were nationalized, Ratanarak completed a recapitalization of Bank of Ayudhya,&lt;ref name=ASEAN&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Akira Suehiro|author2=Natenapha Wailerdsak|title=Family Business in Thailand|journal=ASEAN Economic Bulletin|year=2004|volume=21|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bank continued to improve its performance in the post-crisis aftermath.  In 1996 before the crisis the bank had a market value of US $4 billion in 2014 prices&lt;ref name="DJ Stock 1996"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand Closing Stock Prices|work=Dow Jones Newswire|accessdate=20 August 2013|date=10 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this had risen to US $7 billion in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Companies/Securities in Focus|url=http://www.set.or.th/set/companyprofile.do?symbol=BAY&amp;language=en&amp;country=US|website=The Stock Exchange of Thailand|accessdate=2 July 2014|ref=Bay}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family shareholding in the bank was reduced in 2007 from 35%&lt;ref name=AWSJ&gt;{{cite news|last=Utumporn|first=Pichayaporn|title=Bank of Ayudhya Share-Issue Plan Pleases Shareholders and Analysts|newspaper=The Asian Wall Street Journal|date=7 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 25%&lt;ref name=Nation /&gt; to comply with a reduction in the maximum permitted holding under new banking regulations which came into force in 2008.  The reduction in the family’s holding was taken up by GE Capital whom the family brought into the management of the bank in 2007 to install best practice.&lt;ref name=NationBAY&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanoksilp|first=Jiwamol|title=BAY gears up for new era as Krit steps down|newspaper=The Nation (Thailand)|date=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 GE Capital sold their holding to Japan’s MUFJ following losses incurred in the 2008 banking crisis,&lt;ref name=bloombergnews&gt;{{cite news|last=Vallikappen|first=Sanat|title=GE Raises $462 Million From Selling 7.6% of Bank of Ayudhya|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/ge-raises-462-million-from-selling-7-6-of-bank-of-ayudhya-1-.html|newspaper=Bloomberg News|date=8 April 2013|author2=Joyce Koh|author3=Anuchit Nguyen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a change in strategy by GE to reduce their exposure to financial services.&lt;ref name=lex&gt;{{cite news|last=Lex|title=General Electric: the long game|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/3/d95e609c-a073-11e2-88b6-00144feabdc0.html|newspaper=Financial Times|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the Ratanarak family controlled 25% of the bank’s equity with the remaining equity held by MUFJ.&lt;ref name=Nation /&gt;

The Ratanarak Group emerged from the crisis with Ratanarak at the head of one of the top five business families in Thailand,&lt;ref name=ASEAN /&gt; and one of three of Thailand’s most powerful banking families along with the Sophonpanich and [[Lamsam family|Lamsam]] families.&lt;ref name=Wingfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Gomez|first=Edmund|title=Political business in East Asia|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-27149-5|pages=253–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1993, Ratanarak has added property companies Eastern Star and Grand Canal Land and media company Matching Maximise Solution to the family business group.

In 1981 Ratanarak became Thailand’s youngest senator at the age of 35, serving for four terms.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], the '''long run''' is the conceptual time period in which there are no [[fixed factors of production]], so that there are no constraints preventing changing the output level by changing the [[Capital (economics)|capital stock]] or by entering or leaving an industry. The long run contrasts with the '''short run''', in which some factors are variable and others are fixed, constraining entry or exit from an industry.  In [[macroeconomics]], the long run is the period when the general [[price level]],  contractual wage rates, and expectations adjust fully to the state of the economy, in contrast to the short run when these variables may not fully adjust.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Samuelson and [[William Nordhaus|William D. Nordhaus]] (2004). ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'', 18th ed., [end] Glossary of Terms, "Long run" and "Short run."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arleen J. Hoag|author2=John H. Hoag|title=Introductory Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2AcaoqC-28C&amp;pg=PA119|year=2006|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-256-891-5|pages=119+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long run==
In the long run, [[business|firm]]s 
change production levels in response to (expected) [[economic profit]]s or losses, and the  [[land (economics)|land]], [[labour (economics)|labour]], [[capital goods]] and [[entrepreneurship]] vary to reach the minimum level of long-run [[average cost]]. In the simplified case of plant capacity as the only fixed factor, a generic firm can make these changes in the long run:
* enter an industry in response to (expected) profits
* leave an industry in response to losses
* increase its plant in response to profits
* decrease its plant in response to losses 

The long run is associated with the [[Cost curve#Long-run average cost curve (LRAC)|long-run average cost]] (LRAC) curve in [[microeconomic]] models along which a firm would minimize its [[average cost]] (cost per unit) for each respective long-run quantity of output.  ''[[Long-run marginal cost]]'' (''LRMC'') is the added cost of providing an additional unit of [[Service (economics)|service]] or [[commodity]] from changing capacity level to reach the lowest cost associated with that extra output. LRMC equalling price is efficient as to [[resource allocation]] in the long run. The concept of ''long-run cost'' is also used in determining whether the long-run expected to induce the firm to remain in the industry or shut down production there. In long-run equilibrium of an industry in which [[perfect competition]] prevails, the LRMC = LRAC at the minimum LRAC and associated output. The shape of the long-run marginal and average costs curves is determined by [[returns to scale]]. 

The long run is a planning and implementation stage.&lt;ref&gt; Melvin &amp; Boyes,  2002. ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed., p. 185. Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyes, W page 107"&gt;Boyes, W., 2004. ''The New Managerial Economics'', p. 107. Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; Here a firm may decide that it needs to produce on a larger scale by building a new plant or adding a production line. The firm may decide that new technology should be incorporated into its production process. The firm thus considers all its long-run production options and selects the optimal combination of inputs and technology for its long-run purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin &amp; Boyes, 2002. ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed., p. 185. Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; The optimal combination of inputs is the least-cost combination of inputs for desired level of output when all inputs are variable.&lt;ref name="Boyes, W page 107"/&gt; Once the decisions are made and implemented and production begins, the firm is operating in the short run with fixed and variable inputs.&lt;ref name="Boyes, W page 107"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Perloff, J, 2008. ''Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus'', p. 230. Pearson .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short run==
All production in real time occurs in the short run.  
In the short run, a [[profit maximization|profit-maximizing]] firm will:
* increase production if [[marginal cost]] is less than [[marginal revenue]] (added revenue per additional unit of output);
* decrease production if [[marginal cost]] is greater than [[marginal revenue]];
* continue producing if [[average variable cost]] is less than [[price]] per unit, even if [[average total cost]] is greater than [[price]];
* shut down if [[average variable cost]] is greater than [[price]] at each level of outputs

==Transition from short run to long run==
The transition from the short run to the long run may be done by considering some short-run equilibrium that is also a long-run equilibrium as to [[supply and demand]], then comparing that state against a new short-run and long-run equilibrium state from a change that disturbs  equilibrium, say in the sales-tax rate,  tracing out the short-run adjustment first, then the long-run adjustment.  Each is an example of [[comparative statics]]. [[Alfred Marshall]] (1890) pioneered in comparative-static period analysis.&lt;ref&gt;• John K. Whitaker, 2008. "Marshall, Alfred (1842–1924)," Price determination and period analysis, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Alfred Marshall, [1890] 1890. [[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|''Principles of Economics'']], Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguished between the temporary or market period (with output fixed), the short period, and the long period.  "Classic" contemporary graphical and formal treatments include those of [[Jacob Viner]] (1931),&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Viner, 1931. "Costs Curves and Supply Curves," ''Zeitschrift für Nationalölkonomie'' (''Journal of Economics''), 3, pp. [http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/VinerJE.pdf 23-46.]  Reprinted in R. B. Emmett, ed. 2002, ''The Chicago Tradition in Economics, 1892-1945'', Routledge, v. 6, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rwhrYnGEYdoC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA192=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 192-] 215.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hicks]] (1939),&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Hicks, 1939. ''[[Value and Capital|Value and Capital: An Inquiry into Some Fundamental Principles of Economic Theory]]'', Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Samuelson]] (1947).&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Samuelson, 1947. ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'', Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The law of diminishing marginal r', 5th ed., p.  185.  Prentice-Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-019673-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The law is related to a positive slope of the [[Cost curve#Short-run marginal cost curve (SRMC)|short-run marginal-cost curve]].&lt;ref&gt;While the law does not directly apply in the long run it is not irrelevant. The long run is the planning phase. A manager deciding which of several plants to build would want to know the shape of the SR cost curves associated with each of these plants. Marginal diminishing returns  are related to the shape of the short-run marginal and average cost curves.  Thus the law indirectly effects long-run decision making per R. Pindyck &amp; D. Rubinfeld, 2001, ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed., pp. 185-86.  Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macroeconomic usages==
The usage of ''long run'' and ''short run'' in [[macroeconomics]] differs somewhat from the above microeconomic usage. [[John Maynard Keynes]] in 1936 emphasized fundamental factors of a market economy that might result in prolonged periods away from [[full employment|full-employment]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Panico and Fabio Petri, 2008. "long run and short run," Short- and long-period in Keynes, ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition.  [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_L000192&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Long%20run&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Keynes, 1936. ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In later macroeconomic usage, the long run is the period in which the [[price level]] for the overall economy is completely flexible as to shifts in [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]]. In addition there is full mobility of labor and capital between [[List of recognized economic sectors|sectors]] of the economy and full [[Capital (economics)|capital]] mobility between nations. In the short run none of these conditions need fully hold. The price level is [[Sticky (economics)|sticky]] or fixed in response to changes in aggregate demand or supply, capital is not fully mobile between sectors, and capital is not fully mobile across countries due to interest rate differences among countries and fixed exchange rates.&lt;ref&gt;[[N. Gregory Mankiw]], 2002. ''Macroeconomics'', 5th ed.  pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B-iNoOEoSnkC&amp;printsec=fin&amp;pg=PA240=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 240,] [https://books.google.com/books?id=B-iNoOEoSnkC&amp;printsec=fin&amp;pg=PR12=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 120], and [https://books.google.com/books?id=B-iNoOEoSnkC&amp;printsec=fin&amp;pg=PA327=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 327–329.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A famous critique of neglecting short-run analysis was by Keynes, who wrote that "In the long run, we are all dead", referring to the long-run proposition of the [[quantity theory of money]], for example, a doubling of the [[money supply]] doubling the [[price level]].&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Keynes, 1923. ''A Tract on Monetary Reform'', p. 65. Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mall Tycoon''''' is a [[business simulation game]], released in 2002 for [[Windows 95]]/98/ME. It was developed by [[Holistic Designs]] and published by [[Take-Two Interactive]].&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/pc-games/mall-tycoon-pc/4505-9696_7-30984195.html|title=Mall Tycoon Review - PC Games - CNET Reviews|work=[[CNET]]|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two sequels: Mall Tycoon 2 (which also had a "Deluxe" extended edition) and Mall Tycoon 3.

==Gameplay==
The game begins as an empty plot of land upon which the player develops his or her mall. Players can build shops, customize decorations, organize special events such as fashion shows, and manage mall employees. It is important for the player to work out what is profitable and what is not to ensure the survival of the fledgling mall. The mall may become overrun with zombies or aliens which can be eradicated when the player calls upon the [[Men in Black]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the United States, ''Mall Tycoon'' sold 420,000 copies and earned $7.6 million by August 2006, after its release in January 2002. It was the country's 36th best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of all ''Mall Tycoon'' series entries released between January 2000 and August 2006 had reached 820,000 units in the United States by the latter date.&lt;ref name=edgesales&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017165955/http://www.edge-online.com/features/top-100-pc-games-21st-century/ |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/top-100-pc-games-21st-century/ |title=The Top 100 PC Games of the 21st Century| author=''Edge'' Staff | date=August 25, 2006 |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |archivedate=October 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game received "generally unfavorable" reviews, according to video game [[review score aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=Metacritic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/mall-tycoon/critic-reviews |title=Mall Tycoon Critic Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=August 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826010101/http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/mall%2Dtycoon/critic%2Dreviews|archivedate=August 26, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' criticized the game for its wonky camera and frustrating interface. The magazine opined that even the poorly received [[Airport Tycoon]] is a better game than Mall Tycoon.&lt;ref name=CGW&gt;{{cite journal|author=Editors of ''CGW''|journal=[[Computer Gaming World]]|title=Sim Games that Suck|date=July 2004|issue=240|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mall Tycoon 2'' is a [[business simulation game]], released in [[2003 in video gaming|2003]]. It is the sequel to ''Mall Tycoon'', which allows the gamer to construct, expand and thereafter manage a shopping mall. It describes itself as the "Ultimate Mall Experience".

The Mall is visited by many types of customers, from children to seniors. There are also criminals among the clientele, who should be caught by the mall's security guards, and visits by [[dog]]s, which indicates a low level of hygiene and security. Staff can be hired to perform these duties, such as janitors for cleaning floors,  but some of the hiring specifications require background checks, which cost money and affect bottom line.

The number of stores and the rating also affect the number of customers the mall gets. For every store, five people can fit into your shopping mall, and the higher the rating, the more people come to your mall. The game provides a wide variety of stores. They include electronics, clothing, food, entertainment, sports and services. Many of the more advanced stores need to be researched before they can be constructed. A player can build a mall atrium and arrange monthly events to promote the mall. Such promotions include car shows, a mall oasis and a circus. An "owner" also can build restaurants, movie theaters, bowling alleys and arcades to attract customers. As with hiring research, these new additions also must be researched and evaluated.

Floors may be changed easily and can be customised. Wood is the most common flooring medium, but other types include a puzzle floor for the kids' area and tiles for the food court. Adding floors to the mall is expensive, but is a necessary investment when all vacant areas have been occupied and expanded to their limits.

The Deluxe version of ''Mall Tycoon 2'' adds certain scenarios, more customer types and other new features.

''Mall Tycoon 3'' is a [[business simulation game]], released in [[2005 in video gaming|2005]]. It was developed by [[Cat Daddy Games]] and published by [[Global Star Software]]. It is the third and final installment in the Mall Tycoon series, after the original ''Mall Tycoon'' and ''[[Mall Tycoon 2]]''. The game was released to mixed reviews, getting lower than the previous games.

After selecting to play in sandbox mode, three starting locations are given. You may choose to build your mall in a neighborhood, a big city, or beside the beach. One may also choose to play a campaign game instead, and select from several different challenges.
[[Image:Malltycoon3 screencap.jpg|thumb|left|Interior view of mall in Career Mode]]

Unlike in the previous installments of the series, Mall Tycoon 3 allows players to create customized stores. Over 40 types of stores of various types are available for placement in a pre-made store or a player may design their own, putting in everything from sale signs to the merchandise racks. Also customizable are the employees; their job capabilities and personal appearances are adjustable. In addition to regular in-line stores, there are also a handful of kiosks, such as one that sells cellular phones.

In the first two Mall Tycoon games, stores were created by placing the set store size, and then adding a store to them. In Mall Tycoon 3, the player paints the floor to create a store, allowing for them to be of any shape or size.

Mall Tycoon 3 features a total of 5 buildable mall levels.

===Subprime mortgage reporting===
[[Columbia Journalism Review]] has called Hudson the reporter who "beat the world on subprime abuses"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/opening_bell_91.php|last=Chittum|first=Ryan|title= Opening Bell: Swiss Mess |publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=2008-07-01|accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and credited him with being ahead of the rest of the media in exposing the fraudulent lending practices that were the driving causes of the mortgage crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/feature/hudson.php?page=all|last=Starkman|first=Dean|title= The reporter who saw it coming |publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=May–June 2012|accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businessjournalism.org has called him the "guru of all things predatory lending."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessjournalism.org/2011/09/29/predatory-lending-guru-michael-w-hudsons-tips-for-reporting-with-expertise-part-one/|last=Gammon|first=Rosland|title=Investigative journalist Michael W.

In February 2005, Hudson and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' staff writer Scott Reckard broke a story about "boiler room" sales tactics at [[Ameriquest Mortgage]], the flagship company of the nation's largest subprime lending operation and sponsor of the 2005 Super Bowl half-time show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ameriquest4feb0405,1,5202756.story|last=Hudson|first=Michael|last2=Reckard|first2=Scott|title= Workers Say Lender Ran 'Boiler Rooms' |website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2005-02-04|accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia Journalism Review]] called the "boiler room" story and a follow-up piece "[t]wo of the most revealing stories on the culture that overtook the lending industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/essay/boiler_room.php?page=all|last=Starkman|first=Dean|title= Boiler Room: The business press is missing the crooked heart of the credit crisis|publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=September–October 2008|accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, Ameriquest agreed to pay a $325 million predatory lending settlement in 49 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-lockyer-announces-325-million-settlement-ameriquest-resolve|title= Attorney General Lockyer Announces $325 Million Settlement with Ameriquest to Resolve National Predatory Lending Case |publisher=[[State of California Department of Justice]]|date=2006-01-23|accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, Ireland's ''[[Sunday Business Post]]'' cited Hudson's 1996 book, ''Merchants of Misery'', for "describ[ing], in great detail, how mortgage-backed securities invented in the 1980s were making a large pool of money available to shady lenders who were making predatory loans to very poor customers at very high rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2008/06/08/story33475.asp|last=Barrington|first=Kathleen|title=Main Street misery moves to the markets|publisher=[[The Sunday Business Post]]|date=2008-06-08|accessdate=2012-07-14}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hudson appeared in the documentary film ''[[Maxed Out: Hard Times, Easy Credit and the Era of Predatory Lenders]]''.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

===Reporting on whistleblowers===
At the [[Center for Public Integrity]], Hudson focused on [[whistleblower]] issues and other financial stories. His work included a series of articles, "The Great Mortgage Cover-Up," about the treatment of whistleblowers who reported fraud inside the U.S. mortgage industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwatchnews.org/2011/09/22/6687/countrywide-protected-fraudsters-silencing-whistleblowers-say-former-employees|last=Hudson|first=Michael|title= Countrywide protected fraudsters by silencing whistleblowers, say former employees |publisher=[[Center for Public Integrity]]|date=2011-09-22|accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series identified 63 former employees at 20 financial institutions who claim they were fired or demoted for reporting fraud or refusing to commit fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwatchnews.org/2011/11/22/7461/whistleblowers-ignored-punished-lenders-dozens-former-employees-say|last=Hudson|first=Michael|title= Whistleblowers ignored, punished by lenders, dozens of former employees say |publisher=[[Center for Public Integrity]]|date=2011-11-22|accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up piece focused on the story of General Electric Co.'s foray into subprime in 2004-07, reporting on eight former employees of GE's WMC Mortgage unit who say management brushed them aside when they flagged loans supported by falsified documents, inflated incomes or other [[Sleight of hand|legerdemain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwatchnews.org/2012/01/06/7802/fraud-and-folly-untold-story-general-electric-s-subprime-debacle|last=Hudson|first=Michael|title= Fraud and folly: The untold story of General Electric's subprime debacle |publisher=[[Center for Public Integrity]]|date=2012-01-06|accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first installment in the series was selected to appear in the [[Columbia Journalism Review|Columbia Journalism Review's]] ''Best Business Writing 2012''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/introducing_best_business_writ.php|last=Starkman|first=Dean|title=Introducing Best Business Writing 2012|publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=2012-06-13|accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some business representatives have been critical of Hudson's reporting. Lawyers for Ford Motor Company criticized Hudson's 1990s reporting on Associates Financial Services, the Ford subprime lending subsidiary that was later the subject of a predatory lending settlement with the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. The lawyers called Hudson's book, ''Merchants of Misery'', which included a chapter on Ford and Associates, "impertinent" and "scandalous."&lt;ref&gt;Preface to second printing of Merchants of Misery (Common Courage Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[IndyMac]] Bank objected&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.allbusiness.com/banking-finance/banking-lending-credit-services-mortgage/11582314-1.html|last=Clough|first=Richard|title=IndyMac born and died in Countrywide's shadow|publisher= [[Los Angeles Business Journal]]|date= 2008-07-21|accessdate= 2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a June 30, 2008, report that Hudson wrote for the Center for Responsible Lending, ''IndyMac: What Went Wrong?'', which found evidence that the bank had "engaged in unsound and abusive lending during the mortgage boom, routinely making loans without regard to borrowers' ability to repay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.responsiblelending.org/mortgage-lending/research-analysis/indymac_what_went_wrong.pdf|last=Hudson|first=Michael|title=IndyMac: What Went Wrong?|publisher= [[Center for Responsible Lending]]|date= 2008-06-30|accessdate= 2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the bank was seized by federal regulators, an IndyMac spokesman dismissed the report as a "hit piece" that "relies on unsubstantiated anecdotal evidence."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The U.S. Department of the Treasury inspector general's  office later reported that its investigation indicated IndyMac had done "little, if any, review of borrower qualifications, including income, assets and employment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/13059311/Indymac-Bank-Thrift-Financial-Report|title=Safety and Soundness: Material Loss Review of IndyMac Bank, FSB|publisher= Office of Inspector General, Department of the Treasury|date= 2009-02-26|accessdate= 2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morison International ==

The association is the legacy of [[Walter Morison]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/5209332/Flight-Lieutenant-Walter-Morison.html Flight Lieutenant Walter Morison - The Telegraph, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; (26 November 1919 - 26 March 2009) a [[Royal Air Force]] pilot who became a prisoner of war and was sent to [[Colditz]] for attempting to steal an enemy aircraft during the Second World War.

Following the war, Morison qualified as a chartered accountant at the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales]]. He was articled at Morison Stoneham, a firm established by his great uncle. Morison then worked at Coopers Bros, the firm that became [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]], before returning to his family firm, Morison Stoneham. He led the firm as a senior partner through a period of great change from 1960 to 1981 before retiring. Morison Stoneham was the founding firm of Morison International.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vrl-financial-news.com/accounting/intl-accounting-bulletin/issues/iab-2008/iab438/morison-international-appoints.aspx Morison International Appoints New Chief Executive - International Accounting Bulletin, October 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130217002846/http://www.vrl-financial-news.com/accounting/intl-accounting-bulletin/issues/iab-2008/iab438/morison-international-appoints.aspx |date=2013-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nariman Point''' is a business district in [[Downtown]] [[Mumbai]]. Formerly the [[Central business district|prominent business district]] on India's west coast, Nariman Point yielded that status to Mumbai's [[Bandra-Kurla Complex]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{citation|author={{null|&lt;!--not given--&gt;}}|title=Why Nariman Point is running on empty|periodical=Mumbai Mirror (online edition)|date=17 December 2012|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/articleshow/17863545.cms?pageno=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Nariman Point's development, Mumbai's business centre was at [[Ballard Estate]],&lt;ref name="MM" /&gt; which {{ndash}} like Nariman Point also {{ndash}} was built on land reclaimed from the sea.

Located on the southern tip of the Mumbai peninsula, at the end of the Mumbai's [[Marine Drive, Mumbai|Marine Drive]], Nariman Point is named after [[Khurshed Nariman|Khursheed Framji Nariman]], a municipal corporator who had initiated the area's development as an extension to the [[Back Bay (Mumbai)|Back Bay]] reclamation. Nariman Point houses some of [[India]]'s prestigious business headquarters, and despite its decline (see [[#History|below]]), it remains one of the more expensive business districts in India, exceeded only by [[Delhi]]'s [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]] and {{ndash}} since April 2012 {{ndash}} by Mumbai's own [[Bandra-Kurla Complex]].&lt;ref name="Chadha"&gt;{{citation|last=Chadha|first=Sunainaa|date=21 December 2012|title=The slow but steady death of Nariman Point|periodical=First Post|url=http://www.firstpost.com/business/economy/the-slow-but-steady-death-of-nariman-point-562877.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to 1940, the area was part of the Arabian sea. A popular leader of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], [[Khurshed Nariman]] (affectionately called ''Veer'' Nariman), a [[Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation|Bombay Municipal Corporation]] corporator, proposed to reclaim the area from the sea near [[Churchgate]]. To accomplish this task, the shallow seafront was filled with debris from various parts of the city. Reinforced concrete cement was also used, the steel for which had to be purchased on the black market at higher prices due to [[World War II]].The entire cost was estimated to be  {{abbr|{{INR}}300,000|equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{#expr:((300000 / 13.33)+50) round trunc-2}}}} or ${{formatnum:{{#expr:((300000*4.03 / 13.33)+50) round trunc-2}}}} in 1940}} (equivalent to about {{abbr|

'''O'Carroll''' ({{lang-ga|'''Ó Cearbhaill'''}}), also known as simply '''Carroll''' or '''Carrell''', is a [[Gaels|Gaelic]] [[Irish people|Irish]] clan which is the most prominent sept of the [[Ciannachta]] (also known as Clan Cian). Their genealogies claim that they are kindred with the [[Eóganachta]] (themselves led by the MacCarthys), descended paternally from [[Ailill Aulom]]. From the Middle Ages until 1552, the family ruled an area within the [[Kingdom of Munster]] known as [[Éile]]. The last monarch [[Tiege Caoc O'Carroll]] surrendered and regranted to the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] [[Kingdom of Ireland]].

==Etymology==
Notable is the history of the Ó Cearbhaill whose territory, known as [[Ely O'Carroll]] in [[Éile]], consisted of the pasture lands of Ballycrinass, Rosscullenagh and Drumcan, extending to the Lake of [[Leghagh]], commonly [[Laghaghirisallive]] and bounded on the west by the lands called [[Laghenagarken]] and on the east adjoining or near to Glencrokin. This was always known as [[Ely O'Carroll]]. The mountain land extended from the Laghanagerah (Lochan na gCaorach) to Polle Dowa (Poll Dubh in [[Roscomroe]]) and then in a south easterly direction to the [[Slieve Bloom Mountains]], which are the limits between Ely O'Carroll and [[Upper Ossory]] meeting at a village called [[Garryvoe]] or [[Scully's land]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offalyhistory.com/articles/385/1/The-Extent-of-Ely-O039Carroll/Page1.html The Extent of Ely O'Carroll]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ely O'Carroll sept was the most powerful and most famous, but there were at least four other septs, O'Carroll of [[Kingdom of Oriel|Oriel]] in the [[Dundalk]] area, O' Carrolls of [[Kingdom of Osraige|Ossory]] in the [[Carlow]]/[[Kilkenny]] area and two septs in the Kerry area.&lt;ref&gt;IRISH FAMILIES, Edward MacLysaght, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; 
The prefix "O'" is very often dropped in the case of this surname, occasionally replaced with "Mac". Carvill is another anglicization of the same family name.

==History==
Of Gaelic [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, the Carrolls have their origins in the ancient kingdom of [[Éile]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.com/~irlkik/ihm/thomond.htm Ireland's History in Maps - Tuadmumu (North Munster)]&lt;/ref&gt; commonly anglicized ''Ely'', as a branch of the ruling O'Carroll family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/Pedigrees1/Carroll1Heber.php Carroll of Maryland] (O'Hart 1892)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ely O'Carroll come from counties Offaly and Tipperary in Ireland. The sept is also known as Eile and Clan Cian. One descendant, [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]] (1737-1832), was a wealthy landowner in Maryland and a signer of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. His cousin, Dan Carroll, was a signer of the Constitution.

Historic Ely O'Carroll surnames are: Carroll, Bohan/Bowen, Dooley, Meagher/Maher/Mahar/Mahan, Kelly/Kealy, Flanagan, Corcoran, Healy, Nevin, O'Connor.

Clan Cian was also known as the Cianachta, the Race of Cian, who was the youngest son, of Olioll Ollum King of Munster, and Grandson, of King Eoghan Mor the 1st (known as) Mogh Nuadath of Leith Mogha (Mogha’s Half) of southern Ireland of the Milesian race of Heber, who contested for supremacy of all Ireland in the second century of the Christian Era.

The Cianachta were led well over 1500 years by a recognized King, Prince, High Chief, or Ruling Lord chosen from members of the O’Carroll-Carroll and rival Houses of the noble Septs of Éile

In the fifth century the Cianacht Chief, Éile Righ Derg (Eile, the Red King) ruled the territory that came to be known as Ely O'Carroll to distinguish the area from other O'Carroll kingdoms and lands.The Kingdom of Éile (Ely) was located anciently in Ormond in the Counties Tipperary, Waterford and extending into Offaly, Leix, Kilkenny.

Cearbhaill (Carroll) Son, of Aeodh, and Chief of the Cianachta  was King of Éile at the turn of the first millennium. This Cearbhaill, the King of Éile, led the Elyans at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 with the High King of Ireland, Brian Boru. F.J. "Eile" O'Carroll, the late O'Carroll of Éile O'Carroll created Clan Cian through the Charter of Re-Formation in 1982-1983 as his personal clan for all Cianachta whose families originally lived within the regions ruled by The O'Carroll of Éile O'Carroll in Ireland as well as to all people who wish to honor their background and the ideals that Clan Cian promotes - Irish culture in all its manifestations and the exploration of expatriate Irish's roots back to Ireland.

===Betham's ''History of O'Carroll''===

The following is quoted from the Ordnance survey letters to [[County Offaly|King's County]] ([[Offaly]]) 1838 cit. Sir [[William Betham]]'s Irish Antiquarian Researches.
Part I, Pg.95. Sir [[William Betham]] (1779–1853) was the [[Ulster King of Arms]] and can be considered a fairly reliable source as such.

The family of O'Carroll, according to the Irish antiquaries, are descended from Kean, the third son of Olioll Olum, King of Munster. Teige, the eldest son of this Kean, was a distinguished warrior, who by killing in battle his three rivals, procured for Cormac Mac Art, King of Ulster, the Monarchy of Ireland. Cormac rewarded him with a grant of land in Connaught called Lurgny Gallen and Culavin, he paying to the King of Connaught and his successors, 150 milch cows in May; 100 beeves and 100 barrels of mead or Metheglin at Alhallontide yearly, forever.

He had two sons, Conla and Cormac Galeng; to the latter he gave the lands of Lurgny Gallen, now called the Barony of Gallen in the County of Mayo and Culavin, which were possessed by his descendants, the O'Haras and O'Garas.

Conla, the eldest son, possessed the lands afterwards called Duthec Eile, i.e., the Estate of Eile, from Eile Ridheargs, of which his descendants were styled Kings, there being no other title of honour in use in Ireland before the coming of the English.

[[Cearbhaill]], the twelfth according to some, and the 16th in descent according to other authorities, from the above Eile, gave name to the Sept of the O'Carrolls, i.e., the descendants of Cearbhuill. The tenth in descent from him was Teige or Thatheus O'Cearbhuill Boy, King of Eile, who caused the Box of Dimma to be gilt, died about the middle of the 12th century and was succeeded by his son.

[[Maolroona O'Carroll]] or O'Cearbhaill, King of Eile, was succeeded by his brother.

[[Donald O'Carroll]], who was King of Ely at the coming of the English under Strongbow and from him are descended the Principal houses of this family.

Maolroona O'Carroll, whose daughter Grace, or Grania, was married to Ulick Burke, Lord of Clanrickard, and was mother of Rickard Sassanagh Burke, the first earl, joined with O'Brien and others against the English Government and gave them much trouble. He died A.D. 1532.

His son Fergonamuin or [[Ferdinando O'Carroll]], who succeeded his father as O'Carroll, concluded a treaty with Leonard, Lord Gray, Lord Deputy of Ireland, 12 June 1538, by which he consented for himself and his successors, the O'Carrolls, Capitanci de Ely O'Carroll, to pay the King 12d. for every carucate of land in Ely O'Carroll, one hundred and twenty marks on the nomination of the chief, and on general hostings to supply the Chief Governor of Ireland with twelve horsemen and twenty four foot men, all well equipped for war with provisions for forty days at the expense of O'Carroll; that on all journeys to those parts, they should supply the Lord Deputy and suite with provisions for three days; that the Lord Deputy should be supplied with provisions by O'Carroll for eighty gallowglasses for three months every year and be permitted to make a road or roads through Ely O'Carroll at his pleasure.

In 1548 Teige Caoch O'Carroll, son of Ferdinando, called by Sir James Ware, petty King of Ely, routed the English out of his country, but afterwards submitted and was created Baron of Ely in 1532 (I have not been able to find the record of this patent) which he did not long enjoy, having been slain by his own Sept headed by his own kinsman and competitor Cahir O'Carroll, who was afterwards slain by William [[Adhar O'Carroll]], younger brother of Teige, who was knighted 30 March 1567 and made Governor of Ely and [[Captain of his Nation]] by Sir Henry Sidney, Lord Justice of Ireland. Sir William died 28 April 1579. His natural son Sir Cahir or [[Charles O'Carroll]], was knighted by Sir John Perrott, Lord Deputy in 1584.

Sir Mulrooney O'Carroll, son of Sir William, was knighted by Sir George Carew, L. D. of Ireland, at Dublin Castle, St. James's Day, 1 March 1603, being the day of the Coronation of King James I.

Roger O'Carroll, son and heir of Sir Mulrooney, was ousted out of his Estates by Cromwell, he having attached himself to the King's party under the Duke of Ormond, but his eldest son and heir, Charles O'Carroll, was in great favour with Kings Charles II and James the I, who were not able to restore him to his paternal estate; the latter made him grants of large tracts of land on the Monoccasy River in the Province of Maryland in the North America, which was divided into three manors of {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} each and called after the possession he had lost in Ireland, viz., Ely O'Carroll and Doughoregan. The third was called Carrolston.

This gentleman was also made Attorney General of the Province and his Estates are still in the possession of his grandson, Charles O'Carroll of Carrolston, Esq. aged 90 years, whose father and himself have been members of the Senate of that State.

Mary, the daughter of the last mentioned Charles, was married to Richard Caton Esq., of the State of Maryland, by whom she was mother to her Excellency Marianne, the present Marchioness of Wellesley and three other daughters Elizabeth, Louisa-Catharine (Lady Harvey) and Emily.

[[James Carroll (mayor)|Sir James Carroll]], who was Mayor of Dublin, was knighted by Sir Arthur Chichester, Lord Deputy at Loghroer, the 30th of Sept. 1609. His father, Thomas O'Carroll, being oppressed by the chief of his family, came to live in Dublin.

Sir James Carroll had a grant of the Abbey of Baltinglass and was ancestor to the present High Sheriff of the County of Wicklow, Henry Griffiths (Carroll) of Ballymore Esq.

Donagh, or Denis O'Carroll, descended from Donogh O'Carroll, brother to Mulrooney O'Carroll, Chief of his name, who died in 1532, was possessed of the estates of Modereeny and Buolybrack in Tipperary and was ousted by Cromwell. He married O'Kennedy's daughter and had thirty sons, who he formed into a troop of horse and presented to Duke of Ormond for the service of King Charles I. On the Restoration, John, his son, had a grant of his lands at Killury in the Co. of Galway, where he married the daughter of O'Crean by Margaret, the daughter of [[Baron Athenry|Lord Athenry]]. His eldest son James Carroll, was ancestor to the family at Killury; [[Daniel O'Carroll]], his second son, entered into the military service of the King of Spain and was made a Knight of the Order of Saint Iago. He was afterwards, through the interest of the Duke of Ormond, made a Lieutenant-Colonel in the British Service by Queen Anne, in which he rose to the rank of Lt. General, obtained permission to bear the Insignia of the Order of St. Iago in England, had also the style of Sir Daniel and was Colonel of a Regiment of Horse. His grandson, John Whitley O'Carroll, was British resident at Saxe Weimar in 1804.

Three other O'Carrolls, John, Donagh and Kedagh, obtained grants of land in Connaught from King Charles II in compensation for their losses in Leinster.

From them are descended the families of Springhill, Tirlogh, Ardagh, Carragh and Dunmore in the Co. of Galway; Forthill in the County of Mayo and Doraville in the Co. of Clare. The other principal families now existing are those of Emmell in the King's County; Thurles, Ballingarry, Nenagh, Littlefield and Annemead in Tipperary; Rockfield in the Co. of Wicklow and Coolroe in the Co. of Carlow.

John Carroll of Stephen's Green, Esq., late M.P. for New Ross is the representative of this last family. [[Owen Carroll]] represented the King's Co. in King James's Parliament in 1689.

===Contemporary Chief dispute===
{{Advert|section|date=February 2015}}
A few of the other families which resided within the kingdom of the O'Carrolls were the O'Meaghers/O'Meachair (Maher), O'Caseys, O'Haras, and O'Garas. All of these family surnames, and related septs, also trace their origins to Cian, or Cianachts but many dispute the notion of an overarching Clan Cian. In MacLysaght’s definitive work ''Irish Families'' there are over 200 Irish surnames listed and while recognising that there are many more Irish names it is now considered that these names constitute the main name bearing Irish septs. Many of these septs developed out of larger groups or clans which pre-dated the development of surnames as in the case of O’Brien in relation to the Dal Cás or O’Higgins in relation to the Cenél Fiachach or in this case O'Carroll in relation to the Cianachta. However, these larger groupings seldom gave rise to surnames in themselves.

Specifically in the case of Munster ''The Great book of Irish Genealogies'' compiled between 1645 – 66 by Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh and edited more recently by Nollaig Ó Muraíle (2003), in Vol. II the following pre-surname population groups are listed:

Eoghanacht 			pp 549–599
Dál Cais				pp 599–633
Dealbhna			pp 633–645
Clanna Céin			p.&amp;nbsp;645		= Clan Cian
Clann Tadch Meic Céin		pp 647–661	= Clan Tadch son of Cian
Síol Luighdheach meic Íochta	pp 661–683
About The Cianachta - Clan Cian

Clan Cian was founded and recognized by the late F. J. O'Carroll, of Éile O'Carroll, Chief of the Name. Fredrick Arthur O'Carroll, has since assumed the mantle of Chief of the Name with the backing of his Council of Chieftains. Chief Fred, descends from the ancient Kings and Princes of Éile O'Carroll. The Kingdom of Éile (Ely) resides in the heart of south-central Ireland. The O'Carroll is a recognized member of the Standing Council of Irish Chiefs and Chieftains. Not all of the current recognized Chiefs on the Standing Council live in Ireland, The O'Carroll, the Chief of Clan Cian, currently resides in the United States.

The name Cianachta in Irish means "of the Race of Cian," and so, Clan Cian in modern English. The Cianachta were recognized as a racial group in ancient Ireland and now called again to assemble as a clan in these modern times.  We are dedicated to the preservation of the Éile O'Carroll Territory including the Kingdom of Éile and the O'Carroll family and all related families histories. The clan represents the  O'Carroll/Carroll families and also includes of all the related, family septs, dependent family septs of Éile O'Carroll and other parts of Ireland, and worldwide.  Clan Cian has an appointed Council of Chieftains and Clan Officers that preside over certain designated regional areas appointed by The O'Carroll, Chief of Éile O'Carroll and Clan Cian.

Historically according to Edward McLysaght the first Chief Herald of the newly formed Republic of Ireland, the term "clan" or "clanne" in Ireland refers to the people living within a certain territory, whereas in Scotland a clan is composed of people of a specific family. In ancient Ireland, the old kingdom of Éile O'Carroll (Éile Ui Cearbhaill) included many family surnames that you find today. Of those families, the powerful O'Carrolls were kings, overlords, and later chiefs of their people. A few of the major families related by blood to the O'Carrolls, which lived within the Kingdom of Éile O'Carroll were the O'Meaghers, O'Caseys, O'Haras, and O'Garas. All of these family surnames and other related septs, are members of the Clan of Cian - the Cianachta.

==Maryland==

A branch of the Carrolls moved to [[Colonial Maryland]] and were prominent [[Roman Catholics]]. They played a formative role in the foundation of the [[United States of America]] as [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]] signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. A distant cousin of this branch of the Carroll family was [[Charles Carroll (barrister)]], a convert to [[Anglicanism]]. Other notable Carrolls were Brigadier General [[Samuel S. Carroll]], [[Thomas King Carroll]] and daughter [[Anna Ella Carroll]], and [[James Carroll (Maryland politician)|James Carroll]]. The Carrolls of Maryland have also intermarried with the "[[Blenheim (Maryland)|Blenheim branch]]" of the [[Lee family]] of [[Virginia]].

In addition to these individuals, the Mitchell family of Maryland claim descent from the aforementioned Charles Carroll of Carrollton through the line of their founding matriarch [[Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson]] who, in addition to being a descendant of his, is revered today as one of the earliest and most prominent of the leaders of the [[civil rights movement]].

The Carroll family are famed for the number of beautiful homes and manors they have built across Maryland. Most famous is [[Doughoregan Manor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MHT url|id=63|title=National Register Listing in Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; which remains a family seat in the possession of descendants of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, who is buried there. Another early residence of this branch of the family was the [[Carroll House]] of [[Annapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlescarrollhouse.com/ The Charles Carroll House of Annapolis] official site&lt;/ref&gt; The later [[Homewood House]] was the birthplace of Governor John Lee Carroll, and is now a part of [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MHT url|id=64|title=National Register Listing in Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museums.jhu.edu/ Johns Hopkins University Museums] official site&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mount Clare (Maryland)|Mount Clare]], built by Charles Carroll the Barrister, a distant cousin of the Carrolls of Doughoregan Manor, is the oldest extant Colonial era structure in [[Baltimore City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MHT url|id=41|title=National Register Listing in Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountclare.org/ Mount Clare Museum House] official site&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Oki Kibatarō'''|沖 牙太郎||1848–1906}} was an engineer formerly employed at a Japanese [[Ministry of Industry (Japan)|Ministry of Industry]] (''Kōbushō'') factory. In 1877, only a year after [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s invention, ''Kōbushō'' had started an effort to make telephone receivers by reverse engineering and Oki was in the team that came up with the first prototype.&lt;ref name="Odagiri-Goto"&gt;{{cite book

In January 1881, convinced that the nation was about to enter the age of communications, Oki founded Meikōsha, which was later renamed [[Oki Electric Industry]].  The company manufactured the first telephones in Japan in 1881, only five years after the device was invented by Bell.&lt;ref name="Odagiri-Goto" /&gt;

The '''Phelan Building''' is an 11-story office building located at 760 [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in the [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]] of [[San Francisco, California]]. It has a triangular shape reminiscent of the [[Flatiron Building]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], with its tip at the meeting point of [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]], O’Farrell Street, and Grant Avenue. It is a [[List of San Francisco Designated Landmarks|San Francisco Designated Landmark]].

The building was designed by [[William Curlett]] and built in 1908 by [[James D. Phelan]] on the place of the first, original Phelan Building, damaged by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] and fire.

==The original Phelan Building==

The first Phelan Building was constructed in 1881 by James Phelan, the father of James D. Phelan. It was a 6-story, [[bay window|bay-windowed]], [[mansard]]-roofed flatiron.&lt;ref name="phelanbuilding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phelanbuilding.net/building.htm|title=The Phelan Building History|publisher=phelanbuilding.net|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being advertised to be “thoroughly fire and earthquake proof”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Phelan Building advertisement|publisher=Fraternal Record|date=July 24, 1886}}&lt;/ref&gt; the building was badly damaged in the 1906 post-earthquake fire, and its ruins were subsequently dynamited on April 20, 1906.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/prsf/historyculture/1906-earthquake-fire-fighting.htm|title=1906 Earthquake: Fire Fighting - Presidio of San Francisco  (U.S. National Park Service)|publisher=nps.gov|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==The second Phelan Building==

Work on the new Phelan Building began on October 7, 1907 and was completed on September 1, 1908 for retail stores, and the first day of 1909 for offices.&lt;ref name="brochure"&gt;{{Citation|title=Phelan Building: An Entirely New Modern Class “A” Office Building and a San Francisco Landmark (brochure)|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the earliest office buildings to be rebuilt after the earthquake.

The building's exterior features metal windows and is clad in cream [[Glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed terra-cotta]]. The original steel structure was designed to accommodate 13 floors; eventually eleven were completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Huge Phelan Building already is a landmark|publisher=San Francisco Call|page=40|date=December 29, 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its opening, the building featured an [[assembly hall]] on the 11th floor, [[shopping arcade|arcade stores]] on the second floor, and a basement café.&lt;ref name='brochure' /&gt;

For many decades, the Phelan Building was a ''de facto'' center for [[jewelry]], hosting dozens of jewelers and a jewelry school.&lt;ref name="killyourmac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://killyourmac.com/the-phelan-building/|title=The Phelan Building|publisher=killyourmac.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The penthouse===
[[File:The Phelan Building penthouse.jpg|thumb|287px|The penthouse as of April 2014]]

An unusual feature of the building is a small [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]]. Originally adorned by a rooftop garden, it was used by James D. Phelan to entertain dignitaries. It has later served as a photography studio in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Seidkin|first=Phyllis|title=High Life at O’Farrell and Market|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner, Pictorial Living|page=10|date=August 25, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was abandoned some time in the 1980s.

==Political career==

[[File:BG President Rosen Plevneliev.JPG|thumb|Official portrait of President Plevneliev.]]

Plevneliev became Minister of Regional Development and Public Works under Deputy Prime Minister [[Simeon Djankov]] on 27 July 2009. Minister Plevneliev was one of a handful of "reformers" in the government, together with Deputy Prime Minister [[Simeon Djankov]], the Minister of Economy [[Traicho Traikov]] and the Minister of Environment Nona Karadzhova.

He was announced as [[GERB]]'s candidate for [[President of Bulgaria]] on 4 September 2011.&lt;ref name="trustlaw"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reuters|title=Bulgaria's GERB puts up popular minister for president|url=http://www.trust.org/item/?map=bulgarias-gerb-puts-up-popular-minister-for-president|website=trust.org|publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently won the [[Bulgarian presidential election, 2011|presidential election]] in a second round held on 30 October 2011, with a majority of 52.58% of the vote.&lt;ref name="noinvite"&gt;[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=133454 Bulgaria: Plevneliev is Bulgaria's New President], noinvite.com, 30. October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He defeated [[Ivaylo Kalfin]] from the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] in the second round. He took the presidential oath on 19 January 2012 and officially took over from his predecessor [[Georgi Parvanov]] on 22 January 2012. Among his priorities are administrative reforms, energy efficiency and energy independence and removing of ambassadors of Bulgaria in foreign countries who have served as secret agents during the Communist regime.

As a result of the [[2013 Bulgarian anti-monopoly protests|2013 Bulgarian protests]] against monopoly and high electricity prices, the conservative government of Prime Minister [[Boyko Borisov]] tendered its resignation on 20 February 2013. President Plevneliev, acting in accordance with the constitution, offered a mandate to form a new government within the term of the current Parliament to [[GERB]], [[Bulgarian Socialist Party|BSP]] and [[Movement for Rights and Freedoms|DPS]] but after each of them declined, Plevneliev appointed a caretaker government on 13 March 2013, with [[Marin Raykov]], the Bulgarian ambassador in Paris as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dnes.dir.bg/news/marin-rikov-rosen-plevneliev-ostavkata-boyko-borisov-sluzhebno-pravitelstvo-13343498?nt=4|title=Президентът назначи служебното правителство и насрочи изборите|accessdate=3 October 2014 |date=13 March 2013 |language=Bulgarian |publisher=dir.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, due to the prolonged protests against the involvement of oligarchy in politics and the government, Plevneliev organised the 'Dialogue with citizens' initiative, which involved three debates, focused on market economy, the judicial system and media freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ppm.swu.bg/media/38324/liubenova_m.predizvikatelstva.pdf|title=Предизвикателствата пред новите ПР и медийни комуникации в перспективата на европейските реалности (p. 272)|accessdate=3 October 2014 |date=2013 |language=Bulgarian|author=Lyubenova, Maria |publisher=Проблеми на постмодерността/Postmodernism problems, Volume 3, Number 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plevneliev advocates for closer relations between Bulgaria and the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=134207|title=Bulgarian President-elect courts China|publisher=Novinite|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-09/12/c_131845334.htm|title=China, Bulgaria pledge to deepen cooperation|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=12 September 2012|accessdate=8 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208223152/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-09/12/c_131845334.htm|archivedate=8 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plevneliev has frequently criticized the immigration policy in the UK set by the former Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/21/bulgaria-rebuke-david-cameron-migrants Politicians are judged by what they do and not by what they say]&lt;/ref&gt;

By appointing the [[Bliznashki Government]] on 6 August 2014, Plevneliev has become the first President of Bulgaria to appoint more than one [[caretaker government]].

==Controversies==

In January 2014 the tax authorities launched an investigation on President Rosen Plevneliev and his relatives. This action was perceived as politically motivated assault by the [[Oresharski Government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapool.bg/prezidentat-se-usamni-v-nap-no-poiska-palna-danachna-proverka-news215733.html The President Doubts the Impartiality of Tax Inspections]&lt;/ref&gt; Other reformist members of the [[Boyko Borisov]] government were also subject to such investigations.

He was noted for his purchase of expensive art. Specifically, at consecutive auctions by [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]] in New York in mid  May 1990, Saito bought [[Van Gogh]]'s ''[[Portrait of Dr. Gachet]]'' and [[Renoir]]'s [[Bal du moulin de la Galette]] for $82.5 and $78.1 million, repectively. At the time, these were the two [[List of most expensive paintings|most expensive paintings]] sold, either at auction or through private sales. Taking inflation in account, they remained the two most expensive paintings until the private sale of [[Klimt]]'s [[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]] in June 2006. It took 25 years before Saito's public auction price was broken, through the sale of [[Picasso]]'s [[Les Femmes d'Alger]] ("Version O") at Christie's, New York, in May 2015. 

Saito died of a stroke six years after his acquisitions. Three year later, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, after failing to locate the Van Gogh for an exhibition, expressed concern that both paintings may have been cremated with the owner, since Saito had mentioned in the early 1990s, after having to pay $24m in taxes for them, that it would be better to do so, in order to avoid colossal death duties for his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Usborne|first1=David|title=Missing Van Gogh feared cremated with its owner|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/missing-van-gogh-feared-cremated-with-its-owner-1108973.html|website=Independent|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in 2007 it became publicly known that the painting had been sold in 1997 or 1998 to the Austrian-born investment fund manager [[Wolfgang Flöttl]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Rosenbaum, [http://www.artsjournal.com/culturegrrl/2007/01/dr_gachet_sighting_it_was_flot.html "Dr. Gachet" Sighting: It WAS Flöttl!], ArtsJournal, January 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supercapitalism''' was a concept that developed in [[Italian Fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito. ''Four speeches on the corporate state: with an appendix including the labour charter, the text of laws on syndical and corporate organisations and explanatory notes''. Laboremus, 1935. Pp. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's Fascist leader, [[Benito Mussolini]], claimed that at the stage of supercapitalism, "a capitalist enterprise, when difficulties arise, throws itself like a dead weight into the state's arms. It is then that state intervention begins and becomes more necessary. It is then that those who once ignored the state now seek it out anxiously."&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito; Schnapp, Jeffery Thompson (ed.); Sears, Olivia E. (ed.); Stampino, Maria G. (ed.). "Address to the National Corporative Council (14 November 1933) and Senate Speech on the Bill Establishing the Corporations (abridged; 13 January 1934)". ''A Primer of Italian Fascism''. University of Nebraska Press, 2000. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; To Mussolini, the [[capitalism]] of his time had degenerated from original capitalism, which he called dynamic or [[heroic capitalism]] (1830–1870) to static capitalism (1870–1914) and then finally to [[Decadence|decadent]] capitalism or supercapitalism, which began in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Falasca-Zamponi. Pp. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, [[Benito Mussolini]] declared Italian Fascism's opposition to supercapitalism. 

Mussolini thought of the Marxist socialist system in terms of State Supercapitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito. ''Four speeches on the corporate state: with an appendix including the labour charter, the text of laws on syndicalist and corporate organizations and explanatory notes''. Laboremus, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mussolini there were four types of state intervention, the first one was the one of the liberal states, this is the most used in supercapitalism, in most cases being a disorganized and sporadic intervention. The second one was the one used by communists in its State Supercapitalism. And the third one was the one used in the US which he considered as a combination of the first two State Intervention systems. 

Mussolini argued that although Italian Fascism did not support dynamic and heroic capitalism, he appreciated it for its contribution to [[industrialism]] and technical developments but claimed that he did not support or appreciate supercapitalism, which he claimed was incompatible with Italy's agricultural sector.&lt;ref&gt;Falasca-Zamponi. 2000. Pp. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini strongly criticized this stage of supercapitalism, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At this stage, supercapitalism finds its inspiration and its justification in a utopia: the utopia of unlimited consumption. Supercapitalism's ideal is the standardization of the human race from the cradle to the grave. Supercapitalism wants all babies to be born exactly the same length so that the cradles can be standardized and all children persuaded to like the same toys. It wants all men to don the very same uniform, to read the same book, to have the same tastes in films, and to desire the same so-called labor-saving devices. This is not the result of caprice. It inheres in the logic of events, for only thus can supercapitalism make its plans.&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito; Schnapp, Jeffery Thompson (ed.); Sears, Olivia E. (ed.); Stampino, Maria G. (ed.). "Address to the National Corporative Council (14 November 1933) and Senate Speech on the Bill Establishing the Corporations (abridged; 13 January 1934)". ''A Primer of Italian Fascism''. University of Nebraska Press, 2000. Pp. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Traditionalist Worker Party''' ('''TWP''') was a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]], [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] group based in the United States. Established in 2013 by Matthew Heimbach under the name '''Traditionalist Youth Network''' ('''TYN'''), the group promotes [[white separatism]] and a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] view of Christianity. Part of the neo-Nazi [[Nationalist Front (United States)|Nationalist Front]], the TWP has held a number of protests and other local events. Since 2015, the group also operated as a political party to run in elections for local office.

In April 2018, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that the TWP had been disbanded the previous month after group leader Matthew Heimbach's arrest for battery and his falling out with co-founder Matt Parrott.&lt;ref name=disarray&gt;McCoy Terrence (April 20, 2018) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/imploding-lawsuits-fundraising-troubles-trailer-park-brawls-has-the-alt-right-peaked/2018/04/20/0a2fb786-39a6-11e8-9c0a-85d477d9a226_story.html?wpisrc=nl_rainbow&amp;wpmm=1 "‘Imploding’: Financial troubles.

==History==
===Traditionalist Youth Network===
The Traditionalist Youth Network was established in May 2013 by Matthew Heimbach and Matt Parrott.&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt; Heimbach has been a white supremacist activist since fall 2011, when he formed a group at [[Towson University]] in [[Maryland]] and invited the white supremacist [[Jared Taylor]] to speak at Towson's campus. The following year, Heimbach founded a "[[White Student Union (Towson University)|White Student Union]]" on campus, adopting racist and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] views.&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"&gt;[http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/traditionalist-youth-network.html Traditionalist Youth Network], [[Anti-Defamation League]] (February 7, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 2013, upon graduation, Heimbach established the Traditionalist Youth Network in partnership with Parrot, who founded a white supremacist group, Hoosier Nation, in [[Indiana]] around 2009.&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt; The group eventually became a chapter of [[American Third Position]] (later known as the [[American Freedom Party]]).&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt;

===Traditionalist Worker Party===
The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), which tracks [[Extremism|extremist]] groups, has [[List of organizations designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as hate groups|designated]] the Traditionalist Worker Party as a [[hate group]] and has written of Heimbach: "Considered by many to be the face of a new generation of white nationalists... Since graduating in the spring of 2013, he has entrenched himself further in the white nationalist movement and become a regular speaker on the radical-right lecture circuit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/matthew-heimbach|title=Matthew Heimbach|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 the TYN established the Traditionalist Worker Party (TWP) as its [[political party|political-party]] offshoot in preparation for the 2016 elections, and a small group of candidates from the [[far right]] announced plans to run under its banner.&lt;ref name="Hankes"/&gt; The party states that it stands against "economic exploitation, federal tyranny, and anti-Christian degeneracy".&lt;ref name="Hankes"/&gt; The group's strategy differs from that of the [[American Freedom Party]] (AFP), a different fringe group: while the AFP "has long run presidential candidates with no hope of success" in order to "exploit the election cycle as a way to raise money and generate publicity for their racist positions, TWP actually hopes to win by running for local offices in small communities."&lt;ref name="Hankes"/&gt;

===Nationalist Front===
{{Main|Nationalist Front (United States)}}
On April 22, 2016, the Traditionalist Worker Party formed a coalition with several other organizations called the Aryan Nationalist Alliance. The Aryan Nationalist Alliance later changed its name to [[Nationalist Front (United States)|Nationalist Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viets|first1=Sarah|title=Nationalist Front Chumming up to Klan Members Once Again|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/05/30/nationalist-front-chumming-klan-members-once-again|website=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim was to unite white supremacist, [[neo-Confederate]], and white nationalist groups under a common umbrella. The coalition was joined by the neo-Nazi [[National Socialist Movement (United States)|National Socialist Movement]] (NSM), neo-confederate [[League of the South]], the neo-Nazi [[Vanguard America]], and four other groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2017/nationalist-front-limps-2017 "Nationalist Front Limps in 2016"], ''Intelligence Report'', [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], August 08, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Allison (Oct. 25, 2017): [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/10/25/groups-behind-white-lives-matter/798600001/ "4 extremist groups that will be part of weekend's White Lives Matter rallies"], ''[[USA Today]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the group organized the white supremacist rally in [[Pikeville, Kentucky]] which attracted 100 to 125 supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adl.org/blog/white-supremacist-nationalist-front-plans-rallies-in-tennessee "White Supremacist Nationalist Front Plans Rallies in Tennessee"], [[Anti-Defamation League]] blog, October 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, the affiliated groups participated in the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Smith IV (Oct. 11, 2017): [https://mic.com/articles/185130/white-nationalist-alliance-plans-white-lives-matter-rally-for-tennessee#.TLWr3ii3l "White nationalist alliance plans “White Lives Matter” rally for Tennessee"], ''[[Mic (media company)|Mic.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, the Nationalist Front was a key organizer of the "White Lives Matter" rally in [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] and [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]].

===Internal conflict and disbandment===
On March 13, 2018, Heimbach was arrested in [[Paoli, Indiana]] on charges of [[domestic battery]] arising from an alleged attack against spokesman Parrott and Heimbach's wife, who was also Parrott's stepdaughter. Following this, Parrott shut down the TWP's websites and said he planned to delete membership data, citing privacy concerns. According to Parrott, the TWP no longer existed, as the incident had destroyed the group's credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weill|first1=Kelly|title=Neo-Nazi Group Implodes Over Love Triangle Turned Trailer Brawl|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/matthew-heimbachs-traditional-workers-party-implodes-over-love-triangle-turned-trailer-brawl|accessdate=14 March 2018|work=The Daily Beast|date=14 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrouquere|first1=Brett|last2=Janik|first2=Rachel|title=TWP chief Matthew Heimbach arrested for battery after affair with top spokesman's wife|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/03/13/twp-chief-matthew-heimbach-arrested-battery-after-affair-top-spokesmans-wife|accessdate=14 March 2018|work=Hatewatch|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=13 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fischer|first1=Jordan|title=Indiana white nationalist leader Matthew Heimbach charged with domestic battery|url=https://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/crime/indiana-white-nationalist-leader-matthew-heimbach-charged-with-domestic-battery|accessdate=14 March 2018|work=RTV6|agency=ABC News|date=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, however, Parrott filed a [[Declaration (law)|sworn declaration]] in court (in an ongoing federal civil lawsuit over the [[Unite the Right rally]] in 2017), stating that he had not deleted or destroyed the membership information, as it was relevant to the ongoing litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrouquere|first1=Brett|title=Lawyer: Traditionalist Worker Party membership roll still exists, despite Matt Parrott's vow to destroy database|work=Hatewatch|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/03/27/lawyer-traditionalist-worker-party-membership-roll-still-exists-despite-matt-parrott%E2%80%99s-vow|date=March 27, 2018|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==

Heimbach and his group advocate [[white separatism]], and the group also adheres to a [[white nationalist]] and [[white supremacist]] [[ideology]].&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heim"&gt;Joe Heim, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/this-white-nationalist-who-shoved-a-trump-protester-may-be-the-next-david-duke/2016/04/12/7e71f750-f2cf-11e5-89c3-a647fcce95e0_story.html This white nationalist who shoved a Trump protester may be the next David Duke], ''Washington Post'' (April 12, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36637376 Clashes at white-supremacist rally in Sacramento leave 10 injured], BBC News (June 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Heimbach and Parrott are "self-declared [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnonationalists]]"&lt;ref name="VietsLenz"&gt;Sarah Viets &amp; Ryan Lenz, [https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/07/11/matt-heimbach%E2%80%99s-traditionalist-youth-network-cutting-deals-holocaust-deniers Matt Heimbach's Traditionalist Youth Network is Cutting Deals with Holocaust Deniers], ''Hatewatch'', Southern Poverty Law Center (July 11, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; who aim to create a [[White separatism|separate white ethnostate]].&lt;ref name="Bavis"/&gt; The group specifically promotes a white supremacist interpretation of Christianity,&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt; recruiting members to battle what it terms "anti-Christian degeneracy."&lt;ref name="Schuppe"&gt;Jon Schuppe, [http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/garrulous-polite-white-nationalist-behind-violent-california-rally-n599731l 'Garrulous and Polite': The White Nationalist Behind Violent California Rally], NBC News (June 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The group supports the prohibition of [[abortion]], restrictions on [[immigration]], and ultimately the carrying out of what Heimbach describes as "peaceful secessionist projects."&lt;ref name="Bavis"/&gt; Heimbach has been described in media reports as an "[[alt-right]] personality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Daily Progress]]|title=City plans alternate events, urges ignoring Klan rally|date=June 20, 2017|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/city-plans-alternate-events-urges-ignoring-klan-rally/article_2d77bef2-561a-11e7-9202-7fbf90d823a7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPLC describes the group's ideology as being "virulently [[Racism|racist]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]]."&lt;ref name="Hankes"&gt;Keegan Hankes, [https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2015/10/19/meet-new-wave-extremists-gearing-2016-elections Meet the New Wave of Extremists Gearing Up for the 2016 Elections], Southern Poverty Law Center (October 19, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Both the SPLC and the [[Anti-Defamation League]] note that the group is modeled after the European [[Identitarian movement]].&lt;ref name="Hankes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt; The TWP proclaims itself to be "against [[modernism]], [[individualism]], [[globalism]] and [[Marxism]]."&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt; The group identifies itself as an [[anti-capitalist]] organization and it connects this position to its advocacy of [[nationalism]] stating "For us, to be anti-capitalist is to be a nationalist. Nationalism is a bulwark against [[Exploitation of labour|capitalist exploitation]] and globalism."&lt;ref name="Bavis"&gt;Lauren Bavis, [http://www.heraldtimesonline.com/free_access/white-nationalist-group-seeks-to-form-separate-community-in-paoli/article_3eeb5b4e-b8d1-11e6-954e-535619a8e007.html White nationalist group seeks to form separate community in Paoli], ''The Herald-Times'' (December 4, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Heimbach hailed the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|British vote to leave the European Union]] as "the greatest European nationalist victory since 1933," the [[1933 in Germany|year of the Nazi rise to power]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Schuppe"/&gt; In 2016, the TWP and the ''[[Barnes Review]]'', a [[Holocaust denial]] publication, announced a partnership to promote each other.&lt;ref name="VietsLenz"/&gt;

==Organization and activities==
Traditionalist Youth Networks's only active university chapter is at the [[Indiana University Bloomington]]; this group is led by a white-supremacist activist Thomas Buhls, who has been affiliated with the [[Harrison, Arkansas]]-based Knights Party, a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan]] group.&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt; In December 2016, the group's founder Heimbach claimed that it had some three dozen active chapters and 500 members across the United States; analysts at the Southern Poverty Law Center and Anti-Defamation League state that these numbers are likely exaggerated.&lt;ref name="Bavis"/&gt; The SPLC's 2017 annual report identifies the TWP as having chapters in [[Paoli, Indiana|Paoli]] and [[Bloomington, Indiana]]; [[Benson, North Carolina]], and [[Wisconsin]], and the affiliated Traditionalist Worker Party as having chapters in Paoli and [[Columbus, Indiana]]; [[Sacramento, California]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Madisonville, Kentucky|Madisonville]], and [[Murray, Kentucky]]; [[Kansas]]; [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]; [[Dallas, Texas]]; and Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Begley,

In August 2013 the group protested a leftist bookstore in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]; in October 2013, the group held rallies protesting campus speeches by anti-racist educator [[Tim Wise]].&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt;

In September 2013 the group, as Traditionalist Youth Network, held an event in [[Corunna, Michigan]] in support of [[President of Syria|Syrian president]] [[Bashar al-Assad]]'s government.&lt;ref name="Ridley"&gt;{{cite web|author= Gary Ridley|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2013/09/group_with_alleged_ties_to_whi.html|title= Group with alleged ties to white supremacist movement plans Syria protest in Corunna|publisher= [[MLive]]|date= September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group initially planned as a "Koran BBQ" that would feature the [[Book burning|burning]] of copies of the [[Qur'an]] and pictures of [[Muhammad]] to show "Islamic immigrants and citizens alike that they are not welcome here in Michigan", but changed to a pro-Assad protest after the U.S. government announced its plans to support [[Free Syrian Army|Syrian rebels]].&lt;ref name="Ridley"/&gt; Heimbach told [[MLive]] that he did not regret the group's original plan and that the group supported Islam "when it's in its own home in the Middle East."&lt;ref name="Ridley"/&gt;

In 2014 the group filed an [[amicus brief]] in a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] in Michigan in the case of ''[[DeBoer v. Snyder]]''. In its brief, the group took a stance against [[same-sex marriage]], which Parrott described as part of "the Leftists [sic] social engineering campaign to destroy every last vestige of Western civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Lenz, [https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/03/26/traditionalist-youth-network-takes-culture-distorters-marriage-equality-debate Traditionalist Youth Network Takes on 'Culture Distorters' in Marriage Equality Debate], Southern Poverty Law Center (March 26, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, the group filed a second amicus brief in a case in Maryland challenging a [[Gun laws in Maryland|law prohibiting assault weapons]]; in a four-page filing, the TYN stated that it opposed "the enemy of freedom—the Culture Distorter—in its sights and wishes to shoot down unconstitutional legislation that disarms our people".&lt;ref&gt;Hatewatch Staff, [https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/10/08/traditionalist-youth-network-files-another-amicus-brief Traditionalist Youth Network Files Another Amicus Brief], Southern Poverty Law Center (October 8, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 the group called for the filing of hate-crime charges in connection with the beating of a white man in [[Fountain Square, Cincinnati]]. The local prosecutor, [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] Prosecutor [[Joe Deters]], stated that there was no evidence of ethnic intimidation in the crime.&lt;ref name="fountain"&gt;{{cite web|author= Michael Baldwin|url= http://www.fox19.com/story/29549752/do-white-lives-matter-group-wants-prosecutor-to-seek-stronger-charge-in-fountain-square-attack|title= Do "White lives matter?"

In a separate civil case, Heimbach is being sued in federal court for [[Assault (tort)|assault]] and [[Battery (tort)|battery]] by the woman he accosted at the March 2016 rally, Kashiya Nwanguma, and two of her fellow protesters, Henry Brousseau and Molly Shah, who allege that they were also the victims of violence at the rally. Also named as defendants are Alvin Bamberger (who is accused of assault and battery) and Donald Trump and Trump's campaign (who are accused of incitement to riot, negligence, and [[vicarious liability]]).&lt;ref name="Selk"&gt;Avi Selk, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/03/the-violent-rally-trump-cant-move-past/ The violent rally Trump can’t move past], ''Washington Post'' (April 3, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In the case, Heimbach, who is representing himself, said that he "relied on Trump's authority" in order to oust the woman from the rally, citing Trump's directive to "Get 'em out of here" and promise to "pay for the legal fees" of supporters who expelled dissidents from rallies.&lt;ref name="Hensley"/&gt; On this basis, Heimbach has filed court papers seeking [[indemnity]] from Trump.&lt;ref&gt;David Zucchino, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/27/us/a-trump-campaign-rally-led-to-shoving-and-legal-wrangling-too.html A Trump Campaign Rally Led to Shoving, and Legal Wrangling, Too], ''New York Times'' (May 27, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the group created an online [[crowdfunding]] platform called "GoyFundMe" for racists, white supremacists and other extremists with the objective of advancing their causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sommer|first1=Allison Kaplan|title=What Is GoyFundMe?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82180">'''United States Antitrust law''' is a collection of federal and state government laws that regulates the conduct and organization of business corporations, generally to promote fair [[Competition (economics)|competition]] for the benefit of [[consumer]]s. (The concept is called [[competition law]] in other English-speaking countries.) The main statutes are the [[Sherman Act of 1890]], the [[Clayton Act of 1914]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914]]. These Acts, first, restrict the formation of [[cartel]]s and prohibit other collusive practices regarded as being in [[restraint of trade]]. Second, they restrict the [[mergers and acquisitions]] of organizations that could substantially lessen competition. Third, they prohibit the creation of a monopoly and the abuse of monopoly power.&lt;ref&gt;For a general framework, see Thibault Schrepel, A New Structured Rule of Reason Approach for High-Tech Markets, Suffolk University Law Review, Vol. 50, No. 1, 2017 at https://ssrn.com/abstract=2908838&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Trade Commission]], the [[US Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]], state governments and private parties who are sufficiently affected may all bring actions in the courts to enforce the antitrust laws. The scope of antitrust laws, and the degree to which they should interfere in an enterprise's freedom to conduct business, or to protect smaller businesses, communities and consumers, are strongly debated. One view, mostly closely associated with the "[[Chicago School of economics]]" suggests that antitrust laws should focus solely on the benefits to consumers and overall efficiency, while a broad range of legal and economic theory sees the role of antitrust laws as also controlling [[economic power]] in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;See generally [[Herbert Hovenkamp]], 'Chicago and Its Alternatives' (1986) 6 Duke Law Journal 1014–1029, and [[RH Bork]], ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]'' (Free Press 1993.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|"The Bosses of the Senate", a cartoon by [[Joseph Ferdinand Keppler|Joseph Keppler]] depicting corporate interests—from steel, copper, oil, iron, sugar, tin, and coal to paper bags, envelopes, and salt—as giant money bags looming over the tiny senators at their desks in the Chamber of the [[United States Senate]]&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' (23 January 1889)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although "[[Trust law|trust]]" has a specific legal meaning (where one person holds property for the benefit of another), in the late 19th century the word was commonly used to denote big business, because that legal instrument was frequently used to effect a combination of companies.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Standard Oil Trust was formed in 1882 to combine the Standard Oil Company and a number of other companies that were engaged in producing, refining, and marketing oil. Under the Standard Oil Trust Agreement, the companies transferred their stock "in trust" to nine trustees headed by [[John D. Rockefeller]] and in exchange received a beneficial interest in the trust. Eventually, the trustees governed some 40 corporations, of which the trust wholly owned 14. In 1899, however, the trust renamed its New Jersey firm Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) and incorporated it as a holding company. All assets and interests formerly grouped in the trust were then transferred to the New Jersey company. Because of Standard Oil's monopolistic conduct, in 1911 the Supreme Court, in ''[[Standard Oil Co. v. United States]]'', ordered the break-up of the business organization. The New Jersey company was ordered to divest itself of its major holdings—33 companies in all. See [http://www.britannica.com/topic/Standard-Oil-Company-and-Trust ''Standard Oil Company and Trust''], in {{smallcaps|Encyclopædia Britannica}}. See also [[Standard Oil#Early years]].&lt;/ref&gt; Large manufacturing conglomerates emerged in great numbers in the 1880s and 1890s, and were perceived to have excessive economic power.&lt;ref&gt;"[The trusts are] a kingly prerogative, inconsistent with our form of government, and should be subject to the strong resistance of the State and national authorities." Trusts: Speech of Hon. John Sherman, of Ohio, Delivered in the Senate of the United States, Friday, March 21, 1890&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Interstate Commerce Act]] of 1887 began a shift towards federal rather than state regulation of big business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/7759/Interstate-Commerce-Act.html Interstate Commerce Act].&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890, the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] of 1914 and the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] of 1914, the [[Robinson–Patman Act]] of 1936, and the [[Celler–Kefauver Act]] of 1950.

At this time hundreds of small short-line railroads were being bought up and consolidated into giant systems. (Separate laws and policies emerged regarding railroads and financial concerns such as banks and insurance companies.) People for strong antitrust laws argued that, in order for the American economy to be successful, it would require free competition and the opportunity for individual Americans to build their own businesses. As Senator [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] put it, "If we will not endure a king as a political power we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life." Congress passed the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] almost unanimously in 1890, and it remains the core of antitrust policy. The Act prohibits agreements in restraint of trade and abuse of monopoly power. It gives the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] the mandate to go to federal court for orders to stop illegal behavior or to impose remedies.&lt;ref&gt;Since the passage of the Federal Trade Commission Act in 1914, the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] has had power to enforce section 1 of the Sherman Act administratively, under the rubric of section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. sec. 45. See generally [[FTC v. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co.]] As that Supreme Court decision explains, the FTC also has authority to act against incipient Sherman Act violations and violations of its "spirit."&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=May 2017}}

Public officials during the [[Progressive Era]] put passing and enforcing strong antitrust high on their agenda. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sued 45 companies under the Sherman Act, while [[William Howard Taft]] sued 75. In 1902, Roosevelt stopped the formation of the [[Northern Securities Company]], which threatened to monopolize transportation in the Northwest (see ''[[Northern Securities Co. v. United States]]'').

[[File:Standard Oil.jpg|thumb|right|[[Standard Oil]] (Refinery No. 1 in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], pictured) was a major company broken up under United States antitrust laws.]]
One of the more well known trusts was the [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil Company]]; [[John D. Rockefeller]] in the 1870s and 1880s had used economic threats against competitors and secret rebate deals with railroads to build what was called a monopoly in the oil business, though some minor competitors remained in business. In 1911 the Supreme Court agreed that in recent years (1900–1904) Standard had violated the Sherman Act (see ''[[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States]]''). It broke the monopoly into three dozen separate companies that competed with one another, including Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as [[Exxon]] and now [[ExxonMobil]]), Standard Oil of Indiana ([[Amoco]]), Standard Oil Company of New York ([[Mobil]], again, later merged with Exxon to form ExxonMobil), of California ([[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]), and so on. In approving the breakup the Supreme Court added the "rule of reason": not all big companies, and not all monopolies, are evil; and the courts (not the executive branch) are to make that decision. To be harmful, a trust had to somehow damage the economic environment of its competitors.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[U.S. Steel|United States Steel Corporation]], which was much larger than Standard Oil, won its antitrust suit in 1920 despite never having delivered the benefits to consumers that Standard Oil did.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In fact, it lobbied for tariff protection that reduced competition, and so contending that it was one of the "good trusts" that benefited the economy is somewhat doubtful.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Likewise [[International Harvester]] survived its court test, while other monopolies were broken up in [[tobacco]], meatpacking, and bathtub fixtures. Over the years hundreds of executives of competing companies who met together illegally to fix prices went to federal prison.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1914 Congress passed the [[Clayton Act]], which prohibited specific business actions (such as [[price discrimination]] and [[Tying (commerce)|tying]]) if they substantially lessened competition. At the same time Congress established the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), whose legal and business experts could force business to agree to "[[consent decree]]s", which provided an alternative mechanism to police antitrust.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

American hostility to big business began to decrease after the Progressive Era.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} For example, [[Ford Motor Company]] dominated auto manufacturing, built millions of cheap cars that put America on wheels, and at the same time lowered prices, raised wages, and promoted manufacturing efficiency. [[Welfare capitalism]] made large companies an attractive place to work; new career paths opened up in middle management; local suppliers discovered that big corporations were big purchasers.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  Talk of trust busting faded away. Under the leadership of [[Herbert Hoover]], the government in the 1920s promoted business cooperation, fostered the creation of self-policing trade associations, and made the FTC an ally of "respectable business".{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
[[File:ATF policy.jpg|thumb|The printing equipment company [[American Type Founders|ATF]] explicitly states in its 1923 manual that its goal is to 'discourage unhealthy competition' in the printing industry.]]

During the New Deal, attempts were made to stop cutthroat competition.  The [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) was a short-lived program in 1933–35 designed to strengthen trade associations, and raise prices, profits and wages at the same time. The [[Robinson-Patman Act]] of 1936 sought to protect local retailers against the onslaught of the more efficient chain stores, by making it illegal to discount prices. To control big business, the New Deal policymakers federal and state regulation—controlling the rates and telephone services provided by AT&amp;T, for example—and by building up countervailing power in the form of labor unions.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1982 the Reagan administration used the Sherman Act to break up AT&amp;T into one long-distance company and seven regional "[[Regional Bell Operating Company|Baby Bell]]s", arguing that competition should replace monopoly for the benefit of consumers and the economy as a whole. The pace of business takeovers quickened in the 1990s, but whenever one large corporation sought to acquire another, it first had to obtain the approval of either the FTC or the Justice Department. Often the government demanded that certain subsidiaries be sold so that the new company would not monopolize a particular geographical market.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1999 a coalition of 19 states and the federal Justice Department sued [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="Gavil_2014_Antitrust"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Microsoft Antitrust Cases - Competition Policy for the Twenty-first Century |author-first1=Andrew I. |author-last1=Gavil |author-first2=Harry |author-last2=First |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA |date=2014-12-09 |isbn=978-0-262-02776-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A highly publicized trial found that Microsoft had strong-armed many companies in an attempt to prevent competition from the [[Netscape]] browser.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v.

Microsoft Corp.'', 1995 WL 505998 (D.D.C. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; In his defense, CEO [[Bill Gates]] argued that Microsoft always worked on behalf of the consumer and that splitting the company would diminish efficiency and slow the pace of software development.

Preventing collusion and cartels that act in [[restraint of trade]] is an essential task of antitrust law. It reflects the view that each business has a duty to act independently on the market, and so earn its profits solely by providing better priced and quality products than its competitors. The Sherman Act §1 prohibits "[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce."&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|15|1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This targets two or more distinct enterprises acting together in a way that harms third parties. It does not capture the decisions of a single enterprise, or a single economic entity, even though the form of an entity may be two or more [[separate legal person]]s or companies. In ''[[Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|467|752|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was held an agreement between a parent company and a [[wholly owned subsidiary]] could not be subject to antitrust law, because the decision took place within a single economic entity.&lt;ref&gt;cf [[AA Berle]], 'The Theory of Enterprise Entity' (1947) 47(3) Columbia Law Review 343, where the corollary is argued, that an enterprise ought to be responsible for the debts of each separate legal person within the economic group.&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the view that if the enterprise (as an economic entity) has not acquired a [[monopoly]] position, or has significant [[market power]], then no harm is done. The same rationale has been extended to [[joint ventures]], where corporate shareholders make a decision through a new company they form. In ''[[Texaco Inc. v. Dagher]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|547|1|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held unanimously that a price set by a joint venture between [[Texaco]] and [[Shell Oil]] did not count as making an unlawful agreement. Thus the law draws a "basic distinction between concerted and independent action".&lt;ref&gt;[[PE Areeda]], ''Antitrust Law'' (1986) § 1436c&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-firm conduct tends to be seen as more likely than single-firm conduct to have an unambiguously negative effect and "is judged more sternly".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.]]'', 467 U.S. 752, 768 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the law identifies four main categories of agreement. First, some agreements such as price fixing or sharing markets are automatically unlawful, or illegal ''[[illegal per se|per se]]''. Second, because the law does not seek to prohibit every kind of agreement that hinders [[freedom of contract]], it developed a "[[rule of reason]]" where a practice might restrict trade in a way that is seen as positive or beneficial for consumers or society. Third, significant problems of proof and identification of wrongdoing arise where businesses make no overt contact, or simply share information, but appear to act in concert. [[Tacit collusion]], particularly in concentrated markets with a small number of competitors or [[oligopolists]], have led to significant controversy over whether or not antitrust authorities should intervene. Fourth, vertical agreements between a business and a supplier or purchaser "up" or "[[Downstream (manufacturing)|downstream]]" raise concerns about the exercise of [[market power]], however they are generally subject to a more relaxed standard under the "rule of reason".

===Restrictive practices===
{{Slist illegal per se}}
{{main|Illegal per se|Price fixing|Bid rigging|Market sharing|Group boycott}}
Some practices are deemed by the courts to be so obviously detrimental that they are categorized as being automatically unlawful, or illegal ''[[illegal per se|per se]]''. The simplest and central case of this is [[price fixing]]. This involves an agreement by businesses to set the price or [[Consideration (law)|consideration]] of a good or service which they buy or sell from others at a specific level. If the agreement is durable, the general term for these businesses is a [[cartel]]. It is irrelevant whether or not the businesses succeed in increasing their profits, or whether together they reach the level of having [[market power]] as might a [[monopoly]]. Such collusion is illegal ''per se''.

*''[[United States v. Trenton Potteries Co.]]'', {{ussc|273|392|1927}} per se illegality of [[price fixing]]
*''[[Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|288|344|1933}}
*''[[United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.]]'', {{ussc|310|150|1940}}

[[Bid rigging]] is a form of price fixing and market allocation that involves an agreement in which one party of a group of bidders will be designated to win the bid. [[Geographic market allocation]] is an agreement between competitors not to compete within each other's geographic territories.

*''[[Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. v. United States]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|175|211|1899}}&lt;/ref&gt; pipe manufacturers had agreed among themselves to designate one lowest bidder for government contracts. This was held to be an unlawful [[restraint of trade]] contrary to the Sherman Act. However, following the reasoning of Justice Taft in the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court held that implicit in the Sherman Act §1 there was a [[rule of reason]], so that not every agreement which restrained the [[freedom of contract]] of the parties would count as an anti-competitive violation.
*''[[Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California]]'', 113 S.Ct. 2891 (1993) 5 to 4, a group of reinsurance companies acting in London were successfully sued by California for conspiring to make U.S. insurance companies abandon policies beneficial to consumers, but costly to reinsure. The Sherman Act was held to have extraterritorial application, to agreements outside U.S. territory.

;Group boycotts of competitors, customers or distributors
*''[[Fashion Originators' Guild of America v. FTC]]'', 312 U.S. 457 (1941) the FOGA, a combination of clothes designers, agreed not to sell their clothes to shops which stocked replicas of their designs, and employed their own inspectors. Held to violate the Sherman Act §1
*''[[Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc.]]'', 359 U.S. 207 (1959) a group boycott is per se unlawful, even if it may be connected with a private dispute, and will have little effect upon the markets
*''[[American Medical Association v. United States]]'', 317 U.S. 519 (1943)
*''[[Molinas v. National Basketball Association]]'', 190 F. Supp. 241 (S.D.N.Y. 1961)
*''[[Associated Press v. United States]]'', 326 U.S. 1 (1945) 6 to 3, a prohibition on members selling "spontaneous news" violated the Sherman Act, as well as making membership difficult, and [[freedom of speech]] among newspapers was no defense, nor was the absence of a total monopoly
*''[[Northwest Wholesale Stationers v. Pacific Stationery]]'', 472 U.S. 284 (1985) it was not ''per se'' unlawful for the Northwest Wholesale Stationers, a purchasing co-operative where Pacific Stationery had been a member, to expel Pacific Stationery without any procedure or hearing or reason. Whether there were competitive effects would have to be adjudged under the rule of reason.
*''[[NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc.]]'', 525 U.S. 128 (1998) the per se group boycott prohibition does not apply to a buyer's decision to purchase goods from one seller or another

===Rule of reason===
{{Slist rule of reason}}
{{main|Rule of reason}}
If an antitrust claim does not fall within a ''per se'' illegal category, the plaintiff must show the conduct causes harm in "restraint of trade" under the Sherman Act §1 according to "the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chicago Board of Trade]]'', 246 U.S. 231, 244 (1918)&lt;/ref&gt; This essentially means that unless a plaintiff can point to a clear precedent, to which the situation is analogous, proof of an anti-competitive effect is more difficult. The reason for this is that the courts have endeavoured to draw a line between practices that restrain trade in a "good" compared to a "bad" way. In the first case, ''[[United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|166|290|1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court found that railroad companies had acted unlawfully by setting up an organisation to fix transport prices. The railroads had protested that their intention was to keep prices low, not high. The court found that this was not true, but stated that not every "restraint of trade" in a literal sense could be unlawful. Just as under the common law, the restraint of trade had to be "unreasonable". In ''[[Chicago Board of Trade v. United States]]'' the Supreme Court found a "good" restraint of trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|246|231|1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Board of Trade]] had a rule that [[commodities trader]]s were not allowed to privately agree to sell or buy after the market's closing time (and then finalise the deals when it opened the next day). The reason for the Board of Trade having this rule was to ensure that all traders had an equal chance to trade at a transparent market price. It plainly restricted trading, but the Chicago Board of Trade argued this was beneficial. Brandeis J., giving judgment for a unanimous Supreme Court, held the rule to be pro-competitive, and comply with the rule of reason. It did not violate the Sherman Act §1. As he put it,

{{quote|Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence. The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question, the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, the nature of the restraint, and its effect, actual or probable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Board of Trade of the City of Chicago v.

Although the [[Sherman Act 1890]] initially dealt, in general, with cartels (where businesses combined their activities to the detriment of others) and monopolies (where one business was so large it could use its power to the detriment of others alone) it was recognized that this left a gap. Instead of forming a cartel, businesses could simply merge into one entity. The period between 1895 and 1904 saw a "great merger movement" as business competitors combined into ever more giant [[corporation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |first=N. R. |last=Lamoreaux |title=The Great Merger Movement in American Business, 1895–1904 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-521-35765-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However upon a literal reading of Sherman Act, no remedy could be granted until a monopoly had already formed. The [[Clayton Act 1914]] attempted to fill this gap by giving jurisdiction to prevent mergers in the first place if they would "substantially lessen competition".

Dual antitrust enforcement by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and [[Federal Trade Commission]] has long elicited concerns about disparate treatment of mergers. In response, in September 2014, the House Judiciary Committee approved the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act ("SMARTER Act").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morse|first1=Howard|last2=Browdie|first2=Megan|last3=Swain|first3=Sarah|title=Proposed Legislation to Reconcile DOJ and FTC Merger Standards and Processes |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/proposed-legislation-reconcile-doj-and-ftc-merger-standards-and-processes |publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monopoly and power==
{{main|Monopoly|Market power}}
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=right|quote=Every person who shall [[monopolize]], or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a [[felony]], and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $1,000,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.|source= —[[Sherman Act 1890]] §2}}

The law's treatment of monopolies is potentially the strongest in the field of antitrust law. Judicial remedies can force large organizations to be broken up, be run subject to [[positive obligation]]s, massive penalties may be imposed, and/or the people involved can be sentenced to jail. Under §2 of the [[Sherman Act 1890]] every "person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize ... any part of the trade or commerce among the several States" commits an offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|15|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts have interpreted this to mean that monopoly is not unlawful ''per se'', but only if acquired through prohibited conduct.&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[United States v. Aluminum Corp. of America]]'', 148 F.2d 416, 430 (1945) Learned Hand J, the "successful competitor, having been urged to compete, must not be turned on when he wins."&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, where the ability of [[judicial remedies]] to combat [[market power]] have ended, the legislature of states or the Federal government have still intervened by taking [[public ownership]] of an enterprise, or subjecting the industry to sector specific regulation (frequently done, for example, in the cases [[Water law in the United States|water]], [[United States Department of Education|education]], [[Energy law|energy]] or [[health care]]). The law on [[public services]] and [[United States administrative law|administration]] goes significantly beyond the realm of antitrust law's treatment of monopolies. When enterprises are not under public ownership, and where regulation does not foreclose the application of antitrust law, two requirements must be shown for the offense of monopolization. First, the alleged monopolist must possess sufficient [[Market power|power]] in an accurately defined [[Market (economics)|market]] for its products or services. Second, the monopolist must have used its power in a prohibited way. The categories of prohibited conduct are not closed, and are contested in theory. Historically they have been held to include [[exclusive dealing]], [[price discrimination]], refusing to supply an [[essential facility]], [[product tying]] and [[predatory pricing]].

===Monopolization===
{{main|Monopolization|Abuse of a dominant position}}
*''[[Northern Securities Co. v. United States]]'', 193 U.S. 197 (1904) 5 to 4, a railway monopoly, formed through a merger of 3 corporations was ordered to be dissolved. The owner, [[James Jerome Hill]] was forced to manage his ownership stake in each independently.
*''[[Swift &amp; Co. v. United States]]'', 196 U.S. 375 (1905) the antitrust laws entitled the federal government to regulate monopolies that had a direct impact on commerce
*''[[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States]]'', 221 U.S. 1 (1911) Standard Oil was dismantled into geographical entities given its size, and that it was too much of a monopoly
*''[[United States v. American Tobacco Company]]'', 221 U.S. 106 (1911) found to have monopolized the trade.
*''[[United States v. Alcoa]]'', 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945) a monopoly can be deemed to exist depending on the size of the market. It was generally irrelevant how the monopoly was achieved since the fact of being dominant on the market was negative for competition. (Criticised by Alan Greenspan.)
*''[[United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.]]'', 351 U.S. 377 (1956), illustrates the [[cellophane paradox]] of defining the relevant market. If a monopolist has set a price very high, there may now be many substitutable goods at similar prices, which could lead to a conclusion that the market share is small, and there is no monopoly. However, if a competitive price were charged, there would be a lower price, and so very few substitutes, whereupon the market share would be very high, and a monopoly established.
*''[[United States v. Syufy Enterprises]]'', 903 F.2d 659 (9th Cir. 1990) necessity of barriers to entry
*''[[Lorain Journal Co. v. United States]]'', 342 U.S. 143 (1951) attempted monopolization

*''[[Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan]]'', 506 U.S. 447 (1993) in order for monopolies to be found to have acted unlawfully, action must have actually been taken. The threat of abusive behavior is insufficient.
*''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'', 284 F.3d 47 (1st Cir. 2002) there could be no unlawful monopolization of the soccer market by MLS where no market previously existed
*''[[United States v. Griffith]]'' 334 U.S. 100 (1948) four cinema corporations secured exclusive rights from distributors, foreclosing competitors. Specific intent to monopolize is not required, violating the Sherman Act §§1 and 2.
*''[[United Shoe Machinery Corp v. U.S.]]'', 347 U.S. 521 (1954) exclusionary behavior
*''[[United States v. Grinnell Corp.]]'', 384 U.S. 563 (1966) Grinnell made plumbing supplies and fire sprinklers, and with affiliates had 87% of the central station protective service market. From this predominant share there was no doubt of monopoly power.

*''[[Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co.]]'', 365 U.S. 320 (1961): Tampa Electric Co contracted to buy coal for 20 years to provide power in Florida, and Nashville Coal Co later attempted to end the contract on the basis that it was an exclusive supply agreement contrary to the Clayton Act §&amp;nbsp;3 or the Sherman Act §§&amp;nbsp;1 or 2. Held, no violation because foreclosed share of market was insignificant this did not affect competition sufficiently.

===Predatory pricing===
{{main|Predatory pricing}}
In theory, which is hotly contested, predatory pricing happens when large companies with huge cash reserves and large lines of [[credit (finance)|credit]] stifle competition by selling their products and services at a loss for a time, to force their smaller competitors out of business. With no competition, they are then free to consolidate control of the industry and charge whatever prices they wish. At this point, there is also little motivation for investing in further [[technology|technological]] research, since there are no competitors left to gain an advantage over. High [[barriers to entry]] such as large upfront investment, notably named [[sunk costs]], requirements in infrastructure and exclusive agreements with distributors, customers, and wholesalers ensure that it will be difficult for any new competitors to enter the market, and that if any do, the trust will have ample advance warning and time in which to either buy the competitor out, or engage in its own research and return to [[predatory pricing]] long enough to force the competitor out of business. Critics argue that the empirical evidence shows that "predatory pricing" does not work in practice and is better defeated by a truly [[free market]] than by antitrust laws (see [[Predatory pricing#Criticism|Criticism of the theory of predatory pricing]]).

*''[[Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.]]'', 509 U.S. 209 (1993) to prove predatory pricing the plaintiff must show that changes in market conditions are adverse to its interests, and that (1) prices are below an appropriate measure of its rival's costs, and (2) the competitor had a reasonable prospect or a "dangerous probability" of recouping its investment in the alleged scheme.
*''[[Weyerhaeuser Company v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Company]]'', 549 U.S. 312 (2007) a plaintiff must prove that, to make a claim of predatory buying, the alleged violator is likely to recoup the cost of the alleged predatory activity. This involved the saw mill market.

{{main|US patent law|US copyright law}}
*''[[Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co.]]'', 210 U.S. 405 (1908) 8 to 1, concerning a self opening paper bag, it was not an unlawful use of a monopoly position to refuse to license a patent's use to others, since the essence of a patent was the freedom not to do so.
*''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]'', 316 U.S. 241 (1942) once a business sold its patented lenses, it was not allowed to lawfully control the use of the lens, by fixing a price for resale. This was the [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law|exhaustion doctrine]].
*''[[International Salt Co. v. United States]]'', 332 U.S. 392 (1947) it would be a ''per se'' infringement of the Sherman Act §2 for a seller, who has a legal monopoly through a patent, to tie buyers to purchase products over which the seller does not have a patent

==Scope of antitrust law==
{{see also|US labor law|Consumer protection|Parker immunity doctrine}}
Antitrust laws do not apply to, or are modified in, several specific categories of [[Entrepreneurship|enterprise]] (including sports, media, utilities, [[Health care in the United States|health care]], [[Insurance in the United States|insurance]], [[Bank regulation in the United States|banks]], and [[Securities regulation in the United States|financial markets]]) and for several kinds of actor (such as employees or consumers taking [[collective action]]).&lt;ref&gt;See Areeda (2004) 80-92. On consumer boycotts, see ''[[Missouri v. National Organizationfor Women, Inc.]]'' 620 F.2d 1301 (8th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 101 S. Ct. 122 (1980) and MA Harris, 'Political, Social and Economic Boycotts by Consumers: Do They Violate the Sherman Act?' (1979-1980) 17 Houston Law Review 775, discussing the justifications for wholly exempting consumer action.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective actions===
First, since the [[Clayton Act 1914]] §6, there is no application of antitrust laws to agreements between employees to form or act in [[labor union]]s. This was seen as the "Bill of Rights" for labor, as the Act laid down that the "labor of a human being is not a [[commodity]] or article of commerce". The purpose was to ensure that employees with [[unequal bargaining power]] were not prevented from combining in the same way that their employers could combine in [[corporations]],&lt;ref&gt;See the [[National Labor Relations Act 1935]] §1&lt;/ref&gt; subject to the restrictions on mergers that the Clayton Act set out. However, sufficiently autonomous workers, such as professional sports players have been held to fall within antitrust provisions.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League]]'', 560 U.S. --- (2010) NFL teams held to fall under the antitrust laws.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pro sports exemptions and the NFL cartel ===
[[File:Wrigley field 720.jpg|thumb|right|Since 1922 the courts and Congress have left [[Major League Baseball]], as played at [[Chicago]]'s [[Wrigley Field]], unrestrained by antitrust laws.]]
Second, professional sports leagues enjoy a number of exemptions. Mergers and joint agreements of professional football, hockey, baseball, and basketball leagues are exempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|15|1291}} ''[[et seq]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major League Baseball]] was held to be broadly exempt from antitrust law in ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|259|200|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes J held that the baseball league's organization meant that there was no commerce between the states taking place, even though teams traveled across state lines to put on the games. That travel was merely incidental to a business which took place in each state. It was subsequently held in 1952 in ''[[Toolson v. New York Yankees]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|346|356|1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in 1972 ''[[Flood v. Kuhn]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|407|258|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the baseball league's exemption was an "aberration". However Congress had accepted it, and favored it, so retroactively overruling the exemption was no longer a matter for the courts, but the legislature. In ''[[United States v. International Boxing Club of New York]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|348|236|1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that, unlike baseball, boxing was not exempt, and in ''[[Radovich v. National Football League (NFL)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|352|445|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; professional football is generally subject to antitrust laws. As a result of the [[AFL-NFL merger]], the [[National Football League]] was also given exemptions in exchange for certain conditions, such as not directly competing with college or high school football.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|15|1292}}, {{UnitedStatesCode|15|1293}}, ''[[et seq]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in [[American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League|American Needle Inc. v. NFL]] characterised the NFL as a "cartel" of 32 independent businesses subject to antitrust law, not a single entity.

=== Media ===
Third, antitrust laws are modified where they are perceived to encroach upon the [[News media (United States)|media]] and free speech, or are not strong enough. Newspapers under joint operating agreements are allowed limited antitrust immunity under the [[Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|15|1801}}, ''[[et seq]]''&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, and partly because of concerns about [[media cross-ownership in the United States]], regulation of media is subject to specific statutes, chiefly the [[Communications Act of 1934]] and the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], under the guidance of the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. The historical policy has been to use the state's licensing powers over the airwaves to promote plurality. Antitrust laws do not prevent companies from using the legal system or political process to attempt to reduce competition. Most of these activities are considered legal under the [[Noerr-Pennington doctrine]]. Also, regulations by states may be immune under the [[Parker v. Brown|Parker immunity doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc.]]'', 365 U.S. 127 (1961) and ''[[United Mine Workers v. Pennington]]'', 381 U.S. 657 (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Silver v. New York Stock Exchange]]'', 373 U.S. 341 (1963) the NYSE was not exempt from antitrust regulation, even though many of its activities were regulated by the [[Securities and Exchange Act 1934]]
*''[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers v. Hydrolevel Corporation]]'', 456 U.S. 556 (1982) 6 to 3, that the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]], a non profit standard developer had violated the Sherman Act by giving information to one competitor, used against another.

==Remedies and enforcement==
{{quotebox|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=right|quote=The several district courts of the United States are invested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of sections 1 to 7 of this title; and it shall be the duty of the several United States attorneys, in their respective districts, under the direction of the [[Attorney General]], to institute proceedings in [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]] to prevent and restrain such violations. Such proceedings may be by way of petition setting forth the case and praying that such violation shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited. When the parties complained of shall have been duly notified of such petition the court shall proceed, as soon as may be, to the hearing and determination of the case; and pending such petition and before final decree, the court may at any time make such temporary restraining order or prohibition as shall be deemed [[Justice|just]] in the premises.|source= —[[Sherman Act 1890]] §[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/4 4]}}

The remedies for violations of U.S. antitrust laws are as broad as any [[equitable remedy]] that a court has the power to make, as well as being able to impose penalties. When private parties have suffered an actionable loss, they may claim compensation. Under the [[Sherman Act 1890]] §7, these may be trebled, a measure to encourage private litigation to enforce the laws and act as a deterrent. The courts may award penalties under §§1 and 2, which are measured according to the size of the company or the business. In their inherent jurisdiction to prevent violations in future, the courts have additionally exercised the power to break up businesses into competing parts under different owners, although this remedy has rarely been exercised (examples include ''[[Standard Oil]]'', ''[[Northern Securities Company]]'', ''[[American Tobacco Company]]'', ''[[AT&amp;T Corporation]]'' and, although reversed on appeal, ''[[Microsoft]]''). Three levels of enforcement come from the Federal government, primarily through the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, the governments of states, and private parties. Public enforcement of antitrust laws is seen as important, given the cost, complexity and daunting task for private parties to bring litigation, particularly against large corporations.

===Federal government===
[[File:U.S. Department of Justice headquarters, August 12, 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Along with the [[Federal Trade Commission]] the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] is the public enforcer of [[antitrust]] law.]]
[[File:ApexBuildingHighsmith.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Federal Trade Commission]] building, view from southeast]]

The federal government, via both the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission]], can bring [[civil lawsuit]]s enforcing the laws. The United States Department of Justice alone may bring criminal antitrust suits under federal antitrust laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=William|year=2013|title=Models for merging the US antitrust agencies|journal=Journal of Antitrust Enforcement|publisher=Oxford Journals|volume=1|issue=1|pages=24–51 |doi=10.1093/jaenfo/jns003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous antitrust enforcement actions brought by the federal government were the break-up of [[Bell System divestiture|AT&amp;T's local telephone service monopoly]] in the early 1980s&lt;ref name="'70s 327"/&gt; and its actions against [[United States Microsoft antitrust case|Microsoft in the late 1990s]].

Additionally, the federal government also [[Merger control|reviews potential mergers]] to attempt to prevent [[market concentration]]. As outlined by the [[Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act]], larger companies attempting to merge must first notify the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division prior to consummating a merger.&lt;ref name="areeda"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Areeda|first=Phillip|author2=Kaplow, L. |author3=Edlin, A.

The [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[Federal Trade Commission]] target nonreportable mergers for enforcement as well. Notably, between 2009 and 2013, 20% of all merger investigations conducted by the [[United States Department of Justice]] involved nonreportable transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendrickson|first1=Matthew|last2=Vandenborre|first2=Ingrid|last3=Motta|first3=Giorgio|last4=Schwartz|first4=Kenneth|last5=Crandall|first5=Charles|last6=Singer|first6=Michael|title=Antitrust and Competition: Surveying Global M&amp;A Enforcement Trends |publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/raising-bar-fairness-opinions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[FTC v. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co.]]'', 405 U.S. 233 (1972). Case held that the FTC is entitled to bring enforcement action against businesses that act unfairly, as where supermarket trading stamps company injured consumers by prohibiting them from exchanging trading stamps. The FTC could prevent the restrictive practice as ''unfair'', even though there was no specific antitrust violation.

====International cooperation====
Despite considerable effort by the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]],  the Federal government attempted to extend antitrust cooperation with other countries for mutual detection, prosecution and enforcement. A bill was unanimously passed by the [[United States Congress|US Congress]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Record, Volume 140 Issue 145 (Friday, October 7, 1994)|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1994-10-07/html/CREC-1994-10-07-pt2-PgS92.htm|website=www.gpo.gov|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however by 2000 only one [[International treaty|treaty]] has been signed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zanettin|first1=Bruno|title=Cooperation between antitrust agencies at the international level|date=2002|publisher=Hart|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=1841133515|pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1999/22.html "Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America on Mutual Antitrust Enforcement Assistance ATS 22 of 1999”]. Australasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Retrieved on 15 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; On {{dts|3 July 2017}} the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] announced it was seeking explanations from a US company, [[Apple Inc.]] In relation to potentially anticompetitive behaviour against an Australian bank in possible relation to [[Apple Pay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Catches Attention Of ACCC Over Westpac App - channelnews|url=https://www.channelnews.com.au/apple-catches-attention-of-accc-over-westpac-app/|website=www.channelnews.com.au|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether the treaty could influence the enquiry or outcome.

In many cases large US companies tend to deal with overseas antitrust within the overseas jurisdiction, autonomous of US laws, such as in [[Microsoft Corp v Commission]] and more recently, [[Google]] v [[European Union]] where the companies were heavily fined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40406542&lt;|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Questions have been raised with regards to the consistency of antitrust between jurisdictions where the same antitrust corporate behaviour, and similar antitrust legal environment, is prosecuted  in one jurisdiction but not another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparing The US And EU Microsoft Antitrust Prosecutions: How Level is the Playing Field?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26423319_Comparing_The_US_And_EU_Microsoft_Antitrust_Prosecutions_How_Level_is_the_Playing_Field|website=ResearchGate|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State governments===
[[State attorney general|State attorneys general]] may file suits to enforce both state and federal antitrust laws.

*[[Parens patriae]]
*''[[Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal.]]'', 405 U.S. 251 (1972) state governments do not have a cause of action to sue for consequential loss for damage to their general economies after an antitrust violation is found.

===Private suits===
Private civil suits may be brought, in both state and federal court, against violators of state and federal antitrust law. Federal antitrust laws, as well as most state laws, provide for triple damages against antitrust violators in order to encourage private lawsuit enforcement of antitrust law. Thus, if a company is sued for monopolizing a market and the jury concludes the conduct resulted in consumers' being overcharged $200,000, that amount will automatically be tripled, so the injured consumers will receive $600,000. The United States Supreme Court summarized why Congress authorized private antitrust lawsuits in the case ''[[Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal.]]'', 405 U.S. 251, 262 (1972):

{{quote|Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system envisaged by Congress. This system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor, and strong competition depends, in turn, on compliance with antitrust legislation. In enacting these laws, Congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators. It could have, for example, required violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation. By offering potential litigants the prospect of a recovery in three times the amount of their damages, Congress encouraged these persons to serve as "private attorneys general".}}

*''[[Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India]]'', 434 U.S. 308 (1978) foreign governments have standing to sue in private actions in the U.S. courts.
*''[[Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.]]'', 327 U.S. 251 (1946) treble damages awarded under the Clayton Act §4 needed not to be mathematically precise, but based on a reasonable estimate of loss, and not speculative. This meant a jury could set a higher estimate of how much movie theaters lost, when the film distributors conspired with other theaters to let them show films first.
*''[[Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois]]'', 431 U.S. 720 (1977) indirect purchasers of goods where prices have been raised have no standing to sue. Only the direct contractors of cartel members may, to avoid double or multiple recovery.
*''[[Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.]]'', 473 U.S. 614 (1985) on arbitration

==Theory==
{{main|Antitrust law theory|Competition policy}}
The Supreme Court calls the Sherman Antitrust Act a "charter of freedom", designed to protect free enterprise in America.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|288|344|359|1933}} "As a charter of freedom, the act has a generality and adaptability comparable to that found to be desirable in constitutional provisions.".&lt;/ref&gt; One view of the statutory purpose, urged for example by Justice Douglas, was that the goal was not only to protect consumers, but at least as importantly to prohibit the use of power to control the marketplace.&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=334&amp;page=495 ''United States v. Columbia Steel Co.''], 334 U.S. 495, 535-36 (1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We have here the problem of bigness. Its lesson should by now have been burned into our memory by Brandeis. The Curse of Bigness shows how size can become a menace--both industrial and social. It can be an industrial menace because it creates gross inequalities against existing or putative competitors. It can be a social menace ... In final analysis, size in steel is the measure of the power of a handful of men over our economy ... The philosophy of the Sherman Act is that it should not exist ... Industrial power should be decentralized. It should be scattered into many hands so that the fortunes of the people will not be dependent on the whim or caprice, the political prejudices, the emotional stability of a few self-appointed men ... That is the philosophy and the command of the Sherman Act. It is founded on a theory of hostility to the concentration in private hands of power so great that only a government of the people should have it.|source=Dissenting opinion of Justice Douglas in ''[[United States v. Columbia Steel Co.]]''&lt;ref name=columbia/&gt;}}

By contrast, efficiency argue that antitrust legislation should be changed to primarily benefit consumers, and have no other purpose. [[Free market]] economist [[Milton Friedman]] states that he initially agreed with the underlying principles of antitrust laws (breaking up [[monopoly|monopolies]] and [[oligopoly|oligopolies]] and promoting more competition), but that he came to the conclusion that they do more harm than good.&lt;ref name="friedman"&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v21n2/friedman.html ''The Business Community's Suicidal Impulse'' by Milton Friedman] A criticism of antitrust laws and cases by the Nobel economist&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Sowell]] argues that, even if a superior business drives out a competitor, it does not follow that competition has ended:

{{quote|In short, the financial demise of a competitor is not the same as getting rid of competition. The courts have long paid lip service to the distinction that economists make between competition—a set of economic conditions—and existing competitors, though it is hard to see how much difference that has made in judicial decisions. Too often, it seems, if you have hurt competitors, then you have hurt competition, as far as the judges are concerned.&lt;ref name="www.forbes.com.546"&gt;{{Cite news|title=KeepMedia: Purchase Item |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0503/6309089a.html |accessdate=2005-12-23 |publisher=Forbes |date=1999-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Alan Greenspan]] argues that the very existence of antitrust laws discourages businessmen from some activities that might be socially useful out of fear that their business actions will be determined illegal and dismantled by government. In his essay entitled ''Antitrust,'' he says: "No one will ever know what new products, processes, machines, and cost-saving mergers failed to come into existence, killed by the Sherman Act before they were born. No one can ever compute the price that all of us have paid for that Act which, by inducing less effective use of capital, has kept our standard of living lower than would otherwise have been possible." Those, like Greenspan, who oppose antitrust tend not to support competition as an end in itself but for its results—low prices. As long as a monopoly is not a [[coercive monopoly]] where a firm is securely insulated from ''potential'' competition, it is argued that the firm must keep prices low in order to discourage competition from arising. Hence, legal action is uncalled for and wrongly harms the firm and consumers.&lt;ref name="www.polyconomics.com.547"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memo, 6-12-98; Antitrust by Alan Greenspan |url=http://www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/06-12-98.html |accessdate=2005-12-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051217172640/http://www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/06-12-98.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2005-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas DiLorenzo]], an adherent of the [[Austrian School]] of economics, found that the "trusts" of the late 19th century were dropping their prices faster than the rest of the economy, and he holds that they were not monopolists at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DiLorenzo |first=Thomas J. |title=The Origins of Antitrust: An Interest-Group Perspective |journal=International Review of Law and Economics |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=1985 |pages=73–90 |doi=10.1016/0144-8188(85)90019-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ayn Rand]], the American writer, provides a moral argument against antitrust laws. She holds that these laws in principle criminalize any person engaged in making a business successful, and, thus, are gross violations of their individual expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/antitrust_laws.html |title=Antitrust Laws — Ayn Rand Lexicon |publisher=Aynrandlexicon.com |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such laissez faire advocates suggest that only a [[coercive monopoly]] should be broken up, that is the persistent, exclusive control of a vitally needed resource, good, or service such that the community is at the mercy of the controller, and where there are no suppliers of the same or substitute goods to which the consumer can turn. In such a monopoly, the monopolist is able to make pricing and production decisions without an eye on competitive market forces and is able to curtail production to [[price-gouge]] consumers. Laissez-faire advocates argue that such a monopoly can only come about through the use of physical coercion or fraudulent means by the corporation or by government intervention and that there is no case of a coercive monopoly ever existing that was not the result of government policies.

Judge [[Robert Bork]]'s writings on antitrust law (particularly ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]''), along with those of [[Richard Posner]] and other [[law and economics]] thinkers, were heavily influential in causing a shift in the U.S. Supreme Court's approach to antitrust laws since the 1970s, to be focused solely on what is best for the consumer rather than the company's practices.&lt;ref name="'70s 327"&gt;{{Cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 327|pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25319">'''Windows Management Instrumentation''' ('''WMI''') consists of a set of extensions to the [[Windows Driver Model]] that provides an [[operating system]] interface through which [[Instrumentation (computer programming)|instrumented]] components provide information and notification. WMI is [[Microsoft]]'s implementation of the [[Web-Based Enterprise Management]] (WBEM) and [[Common Information Model (computing)|Common Information Model]] (CIM) standards from the [[Distributed Management Task Force]] (DMTF).

WMI allows [[scripting language]]s (such as [[VBScript]] or [[Windows PowerShell]]) to manage [[Microsoft Windows]] [[personal computer]]s and [[Server (computing)|server]]s, both locally and remotely. WMI comes preinstalled in [[Windows 2000]] and in newer Microsoft [[operating systems | OS]]es. It is available as a download for [[Windows NT]],&lt;ref name=WMINTDownload&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=C174CFB1-EF67-471D-9277-4C2B1014A31E&amp;displaylang=en|title=WMI Redistributable for Windows NT|author=|date=|website=microsoft.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224082551/http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c174cfb1-ef67-471d-9277-4c2b1014a31e&amp;DisplayLang=en|archivedate=24 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows 98]].&lt;ref name=WMIDownload&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=98a4c5ba-337b-4e92-8c18-a63847760ea5&amp;displaylang=en|title=WMI Redistributable for Windows 95 and Windows 98|author=|date=|website=microsoft.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423223349/http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=98a4c5ba-337b-4e92-8c18-a63847760ea5&amp;displaylang=en|archivedate=23 April 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft also provides a [[command-line interface]] to WMI called '''Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line''' ('''WMIC''').&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290216 Description of WMIC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502013243/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290216 |date=2007-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of WMI==

The purpose of WMI is to define a proprietary set of environment-independent specifications which allow management information to be shared between management applications. WMI prescribes [[Systems management|enterprise management]] standards and related technologies for Windows that work with existing management standards, such as [[Desktop Management Interface]] (DMI) and [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]]. WMI complements these other standards by providing a uniform model. This model represents the managed environment through which management data from any source can be accessed in a common way.

==Development process==
Because WMI abstracts the manageable entities with CIM and a collection of providers, the development of a provider implies several steps. The major steps can be summarized as follows:

# Create the manageable entity model
## Define a model
## Implement the model
# Create the WMI provider
## Determine the provider type to implement
## Determine the hosting model of the provider
## Create the provider template with the ATL wizard
## Implement the code logic in the provider
## Register the provider with WMI and the system
# Test the provider
# Create consumer sample code.

==Importance of WMI providers==
Since the release of the first WMI implementation during the [[Windows NT 4.0]] SP4 era (as an out-of-band download), Microsoft has consistently added WMI providers to Windows:

* Under Windows NT 4.0, Microsoft had roughly 15 WMI providers available once WMI was installed
* When [[Windows 2000]] was released, there were 29 WMI providers as part of the operating system installation
* With the release of [[Windows Server 2003]], Microsoft included in the platform more than 80 WMI providers
* [[Windows Vista]] includes 13 new WMI providers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/b/e/3/be37cbce-425e-45c2-a9f5-378026b5be81/04-d-WinMgmtTech-v03-TOURB-FINAL.ppt|title=Windows Vista Client Manageability|author=|date=|website=microsoft.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175059/http://download.microsoft.com/download/b/e/3/be37cbce-425e-45c2-a9f5-378026b5be81/04-d-WinMgmtTech-v03-TOURB-FINAL.ppt|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking the number close to around 100 in all
* [[Windows Server 2008]] includes more providers, including providers for IIS 7, [[Windows PowerShell|PowerShell]] and virtualization
* [[Windows 10]] includes 47 providers for the [[Mobile Device Management]] (MDM) service.&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web |url= https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/wmi-providers-supported-in-windows#mdm-wmi-classes |title= WMI providers supported in Windows 10 | access-date = 30 September 2018 | date= 25 June 2017  | website= [[Microsoft]] | format= html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180930123815/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/wmi-providers-supported-in-windows | archive-date= 20 September 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Many customers{{which|date=January 2013}} have interpreted the growth in numbers of providers as a sign that WMI has become at Microsoft the "ubiquitous" management layer of Windows, even if Microsoft has never made this commitment explicit.

Because of a constant increasing exposure of management data through WMI in Windows, people in the [[information technology|IT]] [[systems management]] field started to develop scripts and automation procedures based on WMI.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Beyond the scripting needs, most leading management-software packages, such as [[Microsoft Operations Manager|MOM]], [[System Center Configuration Manager|SCCM]], ADS, [[Hewlett Packard|HP]] [[OpenView]] for Windows (HPOV), [[BMC Software]] or [[CA, Inc.]] are WMI-enabled and capable of consuming and providing WMI information through various ''User Interfaces''. This enables [[system administrator|administrators]] and operators not capable of scripting or programming on top of WMI to enjoy the benefits of WMI without even learning about it. However, if they want to, because WMI is scriptable, it gives them the opportunity to consume WMI information from scripts or from any WMI-aware [[Enterprise management|enterprise-management]] software.

==Features==

For someone willing to develop one or many WMI providers, WMI offers many features out of the box. Here are the most important advantages:

# ''Automation interfaces:'' &lt;br/&gt; Because WMI comes with a set of automation interfaces ready to use, all management features supported by a WMI provider and its set of classes get the scripting support for free out-of-the box. Beyond the WMI class design and the provider development, the Microsoft development and test teams are not required to create, validate and test a scripting model as it is already available from WMI.
# ''[[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] Management interfaces:'' &lt;br/&gt; Because the System.Management namespace &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.management.aspx|title=System.Management Namespace|author=|date=|website=msdn2.microsoft.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416233646/http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.management.aspx|archivedate=16 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; relies on the existing [[Component Object Model|COM]]/[[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] plumbing, the created WMI provider and its set of WMI classes becomes automatically available to all .NET applications independently of the language used (e.g. [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Visual Basic .NET|VB.NET]]). Beyond the WMI class design and the provider development, like for scripting, the Microsoft development and test teams are not required to create, validate and test new assemblies to support a new namespace in the .NET Framework as this support is already available from WMI for free.
# ''C/C++ COM/DCOM programming interfaces:'' &lt;br/&gt; Like most components in Windows, COM/DCOM programmers can leverage the features of the provider they develop at the COM/DCOM interfaces level. Like in previous environments (scripting and [[.NET Framework]]), a COM/DCOM consumer just needs to interact with the standard set of WMI COM interfaces to leverage the WMI provider capabilities and its set of supported WMI classes. To make all management information available from the native APIs, the WMI provider developer just needs to interact with a set of pre-defined WMI COM interfaces. This will make the management information available at the WMI COM level automatically. Moreover, the scripting COM interface object model is very similar to the COM/DCOM interface object model, which makes it easy for developers to be familiar with the scripting experience.
# ''Remoting capabilities over DCOM and [[SOAP]]:'' &lt;br/&gt; More than simply offering local COM capabilities, as management is all about [[Remote procedure call|remoting]], WMI offers the DCOM transport. In addition, SOAP transport will be available in [[Windows Server 2003]] '''R2''' through the [[WS-Management]] initiative led by [[Microsoft]], [[Intel]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Dell]]. This initiative allows running any scripts remotely or to consume WMI data through a specific set of interfaces handling SOAP requests/responses. The advantage for the WMI provider developer is that when he exposes all his features through WMI, ''Windows Remote Management''/WS-Management can in turn consume that information as well (embedded objects in WMI instances are not supported in Windows Server 2003 R2. It is however a target for Vista). All the layering to WS-Management and the mapping of the CIM data model to SOAP comes for free out of the WMI/WS-Management solution. In the event DCOM must be used, implementing DCOM requires the presence of a proxy DLL deployed on each client machine. As WMI is available in the Windows operating system since Windows 2000, these issues are eliminated.
# ''Support for Queries:'' &lt;br/&gt; WMI offers support for [[WQL]]&lt;ref name=WQLviaPowerShell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ravichaganti.com/blog/publications/ebook-wmi-query-language-wql-via-powersahell/|title=WMI query language (WQL) via PowerShell|author=|date=1 May 2011|website=ravichaganti.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012210736/http://www.ravichaganti.com/blog/publications/ebook-wmi-query-language-wql-via-powersahell/|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; queries out of the box. This means that if a provider is not designed to support queries, WMI supports it by using an enumeration technique out of the provider.
# ''Eventing capabilities:'' &lt;br/&gt; WMI offers the capability to notify a subscriber for any event it is interested in. WMI uses the WMI Query Language (WQL) to submit WQL event queries and defines the type of events to be returned. The eventing mechanism, with all related callbacks, is part of the WMI COM/DCOM and automation interfaces. Anyone writing a WMI provider can have the benefit of this functionality at no cost for his customers. It will be up to the consumer to decide how it wants to consume the management information exposed by the WMI provider and its related set of WMI classes.
# ''Code template generator:'' &lt;br/&gt; To speed up the process of writing a WMI provider including all COM/DCOM interfaces and related definitions, the WMI team developed the ''WMI ATL Wizard'' to generate the code template implementing a provider. The code generated is based on the WMI class model initially designed by the developer. The WMI provider developer will be able to interface the pre-defined COM/DCOM interfaces for the WMI provider with its set of native APIs retrieving the management information to expose. The exercise consists in filling the “gaps” in the provider code to create the desired interfacing logic.
# ''Predictability:'' &lt;br/&gt; Predictability is an important concern for IT professionals because it defines the capability of someone having an experience with a set of interfaces managing a Windows component to apply this knowledge right away, intuitively, to any other manageable Windows component without having relearn everything from ground up. Predictability for a customer is a real gain as it increases the Return of Investment ([[Rate of return|ROI]]). A person facing such a situation simply expects things to work the same way based on his previous experience. The constant increase of COM programming/scriptable interfaces has a huge impact on the predictability, as this makes it difficult for customers to automate, manage Windows and leverage their existing knowledge. WMI with CIM address this problem by always exposing the same programming object model (COM/DCOM, Automation, .NET) whatever the manageable entity is.
# ''Protect existing customer investments:'' &lt;br/&gt; Protecting customers and partners investment motivates customers to invest in technologies. As Microsoft did invest a lot these past years in writing WMI providers, customers and partners invested in tools leveraging the WMI capabilities of Windows. Therefore, they naturally continue to exploit these capabilities instead of having to use a new set of specific interfaces for each Windows manageable component. A specific set of interfaces means having a specific set of agents or in-house developed software based on a new model or set of interfaces especially dedicated to a component or technology. By leveraging the capabilities of WMI today, customers and partners can leverage the work investment made in the past while minimizing their costs in developments, learning curves and new discoveries. This will also have a great impact on the stability and reliability of their infrastructure as they continue to leverage an existing implementation with an improved technology.
# ''Provide a logical and unified administration model:'' &lt;br/&gt; As briefly described before in the introduction, this model is based on an industry standard called CIM defined by the DMTF (http://www.dmtf.org). The CIM class-based schema is defined by a consortium of constructors and software developers that meets the requirements of the industry. This implies that not only Microsoft leverages the WMI capabilities, but also any other third party constructors or developers write their own code to fit into the model. For instance, Intel is doing this for some of their network driver adapters and software. HP is leveraging existing WMI providers and implementing their own WMI providers in their HP Open View [[Systems management|Enterprise Management]] software. IBM consumes WMI from the [[Tivoli Software|Tivoli]] management suite, MOM and SMS are also consuming and providing WMI information. Lastly, Windows XP SP2 leverages WMI to get information status from anti-virus software and firewalls.

==WMI tools==
Some WMI tools can also be useful during the design and development phases. These tools are:

* ''The MOF compiler (MOFComp.exe):'' The Managed Object Format (MOF) compiler parses a file containing Managed Object Format statements and adds the classes and class instances defined in the file to the CIM repository. The MOF format is a specific syntax to define CIM class representation in an [[ASCII]] file (e.g. MIB are to SNMP what MOF files are to CIM). MOFComp.exe is included in every WMI installation. Every definition existing in the CIM repository is initially defined in an MOF file. MOF files are located in %SystemRoot%\System32\WBEM. During the WMI setup, they are loaded in the CIM repository.
* ''The WMI Administrative Tools:'' The WMI Administrative Tools are made of four tools: WMI CIM Studio, WMI Object Browser, WMI Event Registration and WMI Event Viewer. The most important tool for a WMI provider developer is WMI CIM Studio as it helps in the initial WMI class creation in the CIM repository. It uses a web interface to display information and relies on a collection of [[ActiveX]] components installed on the system when it runs for the first time. WMI CIM Studio provides the ability to:
** Connect to a chosen system and browse the CIM repository in any namespace available.
** Search for classes by their name, by their descriptions or by property names.
** Review the properties, methods and associations related to a given class.
** See the instances available for a given class of the examined system.
** Perform Queries in the WQL language.
** Generate an MOF file based on selected classes.
** Compile an MOF file to load it in the CIM repository.
* ''WinMgmt.exe:'' WinMgmt.exe is not a tool; it is the executable that implements the WMI Core service. Under the Windows NT family of operating systems, WMI runs as a service. On computers running Windows 98, Windows 95 or Windows Me, WMI runs as an application. Under the Windows NT family of operating systems, it is also possible to run this executable as an application, in which case, the executable runs in the current user context. For this, the WMI service must be stopped first. The executable supports some switches that can be useful when starting WMI as a service or as an application. WMI provider developers who may want to debug their providers essentially need to run the WMI service as an application.&lt;ref name=mswmitasks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394588.aspx|title=WMI Tasks: Computer Software (Windows)|author=|date=|website=msdn2.microsoft.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406140306/http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394588.aspx|archivedate=6 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''WBEMTest.exe:'' WBEMTest.exe is a WMI tester tool, which is delivered with WMI. This tool allows an administrator or a developer to perform most of the tasks from a graphical interface that WMI provides at the [[API]] level. Although available under all Windows NT-based operating systems, this tool is not officially supported by Microsoft. WBEMTest provides the ability to:
** Enumerate, open, create and delete classes.
** Enumerate, open, create and delete instances of classes.
** Select a namespace.
** Perform data and event queries.
** Execute methods associated to classes or instances.
** Execute every WMI operation asynchronously, synchronously or semi-asynchronously.
* The WMI command line tool (WMIC): WMIC is a command-line tool designed to ease WMI information retrieval about a system by using some simple keywords (aliases). WMIC.exe is only available under Windows XP Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008. By typing “WMIC /?” from the command-line, a complete list of the switches and reserved keywords is available.
** There is a Linux port of WMI command line tool, written in Python, based on [[Samba4]] called 'wmi-client'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/python/wmi-client|title=Ubuntu – Error|first=Rhonda D'Vine,|last=rhonda@ubuntu.com|date=|website=packages.ubuntu.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502194634/http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/python/wmi-client|archivedate=2 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''WBEMDump.exe:'' WBEMDump is a tool delivered with the [[Microsoft Windows SDK|Platform SDK]]. This command line tool comes with its own Visual C++ project. The tool can show the CIM repository classes, instances, or both. It is possible to retrieve the same information as that retrieved with WMIC. WBEMDump.exe requires more specific knowledge about WMI, as it doesn’t abstract WMI as WMIC. However, it runs under Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. It is also possible to execute methods exposed by classes or instances. Even if it is not a standard WMI tool delivered with the system installation, this tool can be quite useful for exploring the CIM repository and WMI features.
* ''WMIDiag.vbs:''  The WMI Diagnosis Tool is a VBScript downloadable from Microsoft [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=62562 here] and is a tool for testing and validating WMI on Windows 2000 and greater. The download includes pretty thorough documentation and the tool supports numerous switches.  When run, it will generate up to four text files which: list the steps taken (the LOG file), an overview of the results (REPORT file), a statistics file (in comma separated values format), and optionally a file listing of the providers registered on the machine (PROVIDERS, also in comma separated values format).  The report file that is generated includes a list of the issues identified and potential ways to fix them.
* ''WMI Explorer:''  The WMI Explorer Tool is a freely available and opensource program downloadable [https://github.com/vinaypamnani/wmie2/releases here] and is a tool for enumerating and querying WMI providers in a graphical user interface. 

==Wireless networking example==

In the [[.NET framework]], the ManagementClass class represents a Common Information Model (CIM) management class. A WMI class can be a Win32_LogicalDisk in the case of a disk drive, or a Win32_Process, such as a running program like Notepad.exe.

This example shows how "MSNdis_80211_ServiceSetIdentifier" WMI class is used to find the [[SSID]] of the [[Wi-Fi]] network that the system is currently connected to in the language C#:

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;

ManagementClass mc = new ManagementClass("root\\WMI", "MSNdis_80211_ServiceSetIdentifier", null);
ManagementObjectCollection moc = mc. GetInstances();
   
foreach (ManagementObject mo in moc)
{
    string wlanCard = (string)mo["InstanceName"];
    bool active;
    if (!bool.TryParse((string)mo["Active"], out active))
    {
       active = false;
    }
    byte[] ssid = (byte[])mo["Ndis80211SsId"];
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The "MSNdis_80211_ServiceSetIdentifier" WMI class is only supported on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

==WMI driver extensions==
The WMI extensions to [[Windows Driver Model|WDM]] provide kernel-level [[Instrumentation (computer programming)|instrumentation]] such as publishing information, configuring device settings, supplying event notification from [[device driver]]s and allowing administrators to set data security through a WMI provider known as the ''WDM provider''. The extensions are part of the WDM architecture; however, they have broad utility and can be used with other types of drivers as well (such as [[SCSI]] and [[Network Driver Interface Specification|NDIS]]). The WMI Driver Extensions service monitors all drivers and event trace providers that are configured to publish WMI or event trace information. Instrumented hardware data is provided by way of drivers instrumented for WMI extensions for WDM. WMI extensions for WDM provide a set of Windows device driver interfaces for instrumenting data within the driver models native to Windows, so [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s and [[Independent hardware vendor|IHV]]s can easily extend the instrumented data set and add value to a hardware/software solution. The WMI Driver Extensions, however, are not supported by [[Windows Vista]] and later operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480152.aspx#appcomp_topic16|title=The Windows Vista and Windows "Longhorn" Server Developer Story: Application Compatibility Cookbook|author=|date=|website=msdn2.microsoft.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421122427/http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480152.aspx#appcomp_topic16|archivedate=21 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
